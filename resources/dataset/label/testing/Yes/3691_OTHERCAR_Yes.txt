            I have been driving fast/luxurious V6 or turbo cars all my life...passionate auto enthusiast.  My priorities have been changing and I needed to save money.  I spent months driving/researching other cars.  All my die hard car friends (engineers, nerds, finance guys) said I had to go honda (reliability, cost, resale, simplicity).  They wanted me to get a japanese accord (most are made in the US) and not the civic because none are made in Japan (you can tell by the first number on the VIN).  They said SUCH a difference in quality build...they are mad at Honda for bringing assembly to the US.  

Anways, I drove the auto civic EX and was impressed...very zippy when I need it (although 0-60s are slow), great gas mileage and cheap gas, comfy seats, lots of room, etc.  All my friends are shocked I got a civic cause I would have never thought of a car in this class...but its great...dont really need more than 4-cylinders and am reminded i am saving money every time I fill up.  Got out the door with $400 out of pocket and paying $240/month for 3 years, 15K miles.  You souldn't be paying much more than invoice on any honda.

I cant believe there is no remote opener for the trunk.  The CD player is too high..i am used to resting my arm/elbow on something as I change stations.  Sooo many random squeeks...US assembly of course...i cant seem to find them..sometimes they drive me crazy.  But all in all, cant find a better lease deal for an $18K car.

I have had the car for 2 months now and very happy.  Will be interesting to see what I like after the lease is up.
