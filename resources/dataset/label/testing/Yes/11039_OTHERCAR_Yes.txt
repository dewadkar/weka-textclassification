            Before getting into specifics about this minivan, I want to emphasize that I am fairly anti-minivan.  I do not like the way most of them look, most of  them are pretty much the same thing with a different symbol on the front grill, and let us be honest -- there is a stigma associated with minivans.  That being said, I ended up with a 2002 Mazda MPV ES even though I was shopping for something entirely different. 


<b>SHOPPING FOR BIGGER</b>

 We recently became a family of six, which means that there is not a sedan out there that can fit us, and even our beautiful Limited Edition Toyota 4Runner can no longer fit us!  As a family man, I have driven a Honda Civic sedan, Toyota Avalon, and a Winnebago Rialta (an eight-seater small motorhome based on a Volkswagen Eurovan chassis).  My wife has driven Plymouth Grand Voyager (with wood trim on the sides!), first generation Honda Odyssey, a Toyota 4Runner SR-5, and now a Toyota 4Runner Ltd.  With the Winnebago, Grand Voyager, and the Odyssey, we were "minivanned out", and had no interest in buying another minivan.  I have to admit that we have become predominately a Toyota family, so we did look briefly at the Toyota Sienna, but our interest did not last long because my wife worked for Toyota and we knew the Toyota Sequoia was coming a couple of years before it actually did, and again we would rather have a SUV rather than a minivan.  

So, we went shopping for a Toyota Sequoia or Ford Expedition.  We loved the Sequoia and could afford it, but...ouch...for that price they should throw an Echo or Corolla in with the deal.  We were not impressed by the 2002 Ford Expedition.  Sure, there was plenty of room (some to spare) for a family of six, but the design of the vehicle was "blah", and although we qualified for the "S-Plan" or "X-Plan" pricing (a special fixed price usually for employees of companies affiliated with Ford in some way), we could not find a dealer who would show us that "S-Plan" price on an actual invoice, and strangely enough that fixed "S-Plan" price varied significantly from dealer to dealer.  The interior of the Expedition was a little too roomy, if that makes sense.  I felt there was plenty of space, but it was not useful space, and instead just made the vehicle bulky and no doubt affected the fuel economy significantly.  We predominately use our vehicles for passengers and not cargo, so the extra elbow room is pretty much wasted on us.  

We were thinking we were just going to have to pinch the wallet hard on a Sequoia, when a coworker of my wife's mentioned the MPV, saying it was redesigned, better engine, etc.  Since Mazda is now part of Ford, we also qualified for the "S-Plan" pricing on any Mazda.  But it was a minivan...ugh!  We were on our way home from a disappointing day of vehicle shopping, when purely on a whim, I took a minor detour to a nearby Mazda dealership to look at this new, improved MPV minivan thing.  I have been converted!


<b>FIRST IMPRESSION</b>

First of all, our reception at the Mazda dealership was much better than any Ford dealership we visited.  We were initially worried as we drove up because the salesmen were "vulturing" by the entrance to the lot, and I was thinking I would have to fight my way to the showroom with my umbrella or something.  However, they were apparently "taking turns", as only one salesman approached us, and he was very mello.  We told him we wanted to look at a 2002 MPV.  He took us to a selection of about ten LX models, saying that the ES (higher trimline) models sell fast, and they did not have any on the lot at the time.  We checked out a sand colored one, and the experience blew our minds.  

I looked at the outside of the MPV as we were approaching the row, and thought, "There is NO WAY this little thing seats 7 people."  Sure enough, this little van had seats with plenty of room for seven people.  I am 6'3" tall, and the first thing I did was sit in the second row of seats...without leg room issues.  Then I easily crawled into the third row seat, and still had plenty of room.  Now, honestly, that third row seat is supposed to sit three, and there really is no way that three people my size can set back there, but it can easily accomodate three kids or a combination of adults and kids.  

We were very impressed by how well designed/arranged the interior was to make maximum use of the smaller space.  This minivan is about the same length as my wife's 4Runner, which only seats five,and yet the MPV designers managed to fit two more seats and still have significant cargo room.  What impressed us the most about the interior was the "side-by-slide" seats (one of the second row seats slides sideways to make a bench or to separate the seats into captains chairs), the "magic" flip-n-fold rear seat that folds flat into the floor, and the cavernous trunk area that becomes available when the seat is NOT folded down -- it leaves a about a foot deep well in the rear cargo area that holds an amazing amount of stuff almost like a full trunk in an economy car.   

There are also wonderful inovations found in this minivan that are not found in others (at leat not yet) like roll-down windows in the sliding passenger doors, 17" wheels/tires on the ES model, etc.  

We were smitten...yes, the very people who were anti-minivan.  One of the reasons we do not like the current generation Odyssey is that there is too much difference between it and the first generation.  There was a reason why the original Odyssey was attractive to the public, and it was not that its size competes with the bigger American vans, like the current generation Odyssey.  In short, the MPV is everything we loved about the first generation Odyssey (small size, good seating, roll down passenger windows, etc.) but the current model MPV comes with a much more powerful engine and very modern features  that compete or surpass other minivans.   

So, if you have not seen one...in person...and are considering a minivan purchase, I strongly recommend going to see one.  I think you will be impressed; I know we were.  


<b>TEST DRIVE (LX AND ES)</b>

Because it was all they had, we first test drove the LX model.  It had 16" alloy wheels on it as an upgrade option from standard 16" steel wheels, but other than that it had standard LX features (cloth interior, manual sliding doors, etc.).  

We were very impressed with the ride -- not the smoothest like our Toyota Avalon, but instead was a much more firm/sporty feel, but still what I would consider ralatively smooth.  It hugged turns very well, with very little roll, and we were able to do a U-turn easily on a two lane road.  Most of the test drive was on a fairly rough, neighborhood road, but the MPV suspension was able to smooth this out nicely without making us feel like we were in an elevator.  

All the controls are nicely located and very intuitive.  Like has been mentioned in other reviews, the steering column mounted gear shift does get in the way of the sound system volume knob, but all MPVs come standard with additional audio controls on the steering wheel, so it is not an issue.  I found the drivers seat in the LX to be adequately comfortable, but I am not afraid to adjust the heck out of a seat in order to make sure it is how I like it.  Everyone has different preferences for the position of the car seat, so I would advise everyone to mess with seat adjustments in any car before proclaiming the seats to be uncomfortable.  

Acceleration was very nice.  The engine growled a tad during fast acceleration, but it does not sound like a bad thing even though you can hear it more than the average car.  During normal driving/acceleration, you barely hear the engine at all.  

This is a tall minivan -- I sit almost at the same height in the MPV as I do my wife's 4Runner, and the 4Runner has oversized tires.  The visability is excellent with no blocked views from wide roof columns or window frames.  This was just a wonderfully surprising test drive.

Since we bought the ES trimline, when we arrived at another dealership to buy it, we also took an ES for a test drive.  The test drive of the ES went better than even the LX, and there is a noticeable difference in the ride on the 17" wheels on the ES over the 16" wheels on the LX.  With the power adjustable drivers seat, I was able to better tailor the seat postion for me as well.  I really like the power sliding doors, too, and found their controls to be very intuitive.  Purely on opinion, I think the ES trimline looks sportier than any other minivan, and it is one of those things where if you are going to own a minivan, at least this one is sporty.  

By the way, we were allowed by two different dealerships to take both of these test drives without having a salesman in the vehicle with us, which I think allows for a much better and beneficial test drive when you can drive it how and where you want to without having the salesman blah-blah'ing in your ear with a sales pitch the entire time.  


<b>REAL WORLD USE</b>

I purchased my MPV in May 2002, and as of this date I have almost 15k miles on it.  I have been using it as a daily driver for school pickup, after school activities, shopping, etc. -- basically anything that requires the entire family to come along, since our other vehicle (4Runner) can no longer hold the entire family.  

I cannot emphasize enough that I have had ZERO problems with this vehicle so far.  I have come up with a couple of "pet peeves" (see "pet peeve" section further down), mostly about some of the design, but nothing really substantial.  I have had some problems getting the oil changed at the local dealerships.  The owners manual and oil fill cap specifically states that this vehicle is to use 5w-20 oil only, and I cannot find a local Mazda dealership willing to put that type of oil in the vehicle -- they always want to put in 5w-30 or even 10w-30.  I realize that it probably does not make that much of a difference, but I am more worried about warranty issues if the proper oil is not used.  I have since read an official announcement from Mazda USA that it will not void the warranty to use 5w-30 oil, but I still would like to use what is recommended, so I do my own oil changes.   

As a daily driver and even a long trip vehicle, I have no complaints about the MPV.  I get better than the EPA estimated gas mileage (probably from faithfully using the 5w-20 oil), and it zips around town nicely and has plenty of cruising power on the highway.  

I purchased the roof rack option and own a rooftop cargo carrier, but I have yet to use the carrier even on the longer family trips because luggage for 7 has fit in the rear cargo area, mostly because of the extra low seat storage well back there.  Yes, it does take some strategic stowing of the luggage, especially considering I also pack a double-stroller back there, but it is very possible for a large family to take this vehicle on a long trip.  

The upgraded 9-speaker stereo with subwoofer in the ES model is awesome and you will not need to upgrade it with an aftermarket system.  You can also get a 6-disc in-dash CD changer although I just stuck with the single disc player.  The bass will vibrate windows.  

There are plenty of well-placed cupholders throughout the vehicle, and there is center console storage, glovebox storage, and a storage draw under the front passenger seat, as well as storage compartments in the front doors.  The seating options are really nice in this minivan as well.  I like that the second row can be a bench or two separate captains chairs.  Anyone with bickering children will appreciate this feature.  The second row seats have the new LATCH system for easier install of infant car seats, and all the rear passenger seats have access to the relatively new tether feature that is on my infant car seats.  

You cannot beat the cost per feature ratio of this vehicle, even the ES trimline, and with it having all the useful room that most folks need, why pay more money to buy a bigger van and deal with maneuverability issues, less MPG, etc.?  This vehicle has also proven to be very reliable, something that we did not have with out other minivans.  The Chrysler minivan was HORRIBLE and we had nothing but problems.  The Winnebago (remember, based on a Eurovan) also was completely unreliable and difficult to find service.  Even the Hondy Odyssey had some rather major problems, including having all the oil in the engine mysteriously vanish , never to be found!  The original Honda Odyssey was also dangerously slow, whereas the MPV has no problems pulling out to merge in fast traffic.


<b>PET PEEVES</b>

(1)  I do not like the way the front passenger does not have control over the door locks like most other vehicles.

(2)  Even the ES trimline does not have power pop-out side windows in the back.  In a minivan with such a wonderful inovation of power roll-down windows in the sliding doors, I can't believe they don't offer this feature.  

(3)  I wish the rear seat was a split setup, as it would even further increase the seating/cargo options.

(4)  I also wish the second row seats had a removeable third seat to allow this to be an 8-passenger van.  There is enough room for it.

(5)  When I bought my 2002 MPV, they did not have a DVD entertainment option, but I understand this was put out in mid-model year 2002, so it's been addressed (but not for me).

(6)  I wish the rear window would either roll down or lift up for better cargo carrying options instead of being a fixed window in the lift gate.  

(7)  I do not like the way power sliding door buttons can override the child safety setting on the sliding doors.  Sure, the kids can't pull the manual open handle, but they could easily press the power  button with a toe and if the door is not locked it could open.  Thankfully, the doors will not power open at all unless you have the transmission in park, but it just makes me wonder why the child locks cannot disable the power door switches that are in the back seat area.  

(8)  I wish this vehicle had a full-sized spare tire.  It is stowed under the vehicle in the area of the second row seats, and I would have gladly sacrificed some ground clearance to have a full-sized spare under there instead of the "mini-donut".  

(9)  The power window button has a one-press down feature for the driver's side only and does not offer a one-press up feature like most other cars we own or looked at. 

(10)  Fog lights should be standard with at least the ES trimline (instead of being a $500 add-on), and the other reason why I did not get them is because they are the new round projection style lights, but the opening in the grill for the fog lights are a cats eye shape, so a plastic fill piece is used to mount the lights.  I think this looks like an aftermarket product, and feel that either the bumper cutouts need to be round or the foglights need to be cats eye shaped like the previous model years.
