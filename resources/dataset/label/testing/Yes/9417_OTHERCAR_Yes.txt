            Years ago I worked for a Japanese company doing studio and technical photography, mostly with Nikon gear. More recently I have used Nikon Coolpix digital cameras for web and magazine publications. I have had the Coolpix 950 and 990 models but I am happy to have upgraded to the 4500. One of the reasons:  this camera works very well for scanning 35mm slides.  Obviously it does not deliver the results of a dedicated slide scanner but for my film archiving purposes I am quite satisfied. The magnesium body of this model gives it a solid and durable feeling. The lens quality is superb for most of the range. The various controls and menus take some learning, and are not exactly the most user-friendly, but the range of capabilities is extraordinary.  I do not like the proprietary battery system and would prefer NiMH AA type batteries for field use.  The use of Type I compact flash memory means lots of availability and ever-lowering memory prices, while the ability to use the IBM microdrive for studio work, while it does draw more power, makes for almost infinite image storage.  Suggestion: get a UV / 1A filter for the lens if for no other reason than to protect it. The Coolpix series is now well established and there are many accessory/aftermarket manufacturers, even for the proprietary battery type, so you need not be enslaved to Nikon authorized stuff. 

I have already recommend this camera to other people, ranging from digicam beginner to experienced gearheads, and everyone who gets through the learning curve is pleased with the results. The net price after shipping and Nikon rebate was just shy of $500 (try Digital Foto Club - was reliable for me).
