            The Toyota Land Cruiser is by far one of the most rugged vehicles I have ever driven.  I started out with an 86' 4wd pickup, progressed to an 88' Four Runner, to an 88' Land Cruiser and finally to my current vehicle which is a 93' Land Cruiser.  Needless to say...I think Toyota manufactures a very high quality truck.  All of my Toyota's had over 150,000 miles on them when I sold them and they were all in excellent condition.  My TLC has proven to be very reliable and descent on gas for an all wheel drive sport ute (about 15 mpg city, 17 mpg hwy).  It's on and off hwy capabilities are amazing.  It is a very quiet vehicle with no rattles or squeaks like I have heard in many other trucks and sport utes of its size.  If you can find a previously owned TLC for a good price...you will not lose much over your years of ownership, they tend to hold their value extremely well and are very reliable!  <br><br>
