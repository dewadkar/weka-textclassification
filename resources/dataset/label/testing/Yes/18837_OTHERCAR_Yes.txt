            This camera is perfect for someone that is new to digital cameras. The floppy disk is very easily axcessable and easy to get at. There is a 2.5 inch LCD screen on this camera that helps in taking pictures. The 850,000 pixels make the pictures of a great quality look lifelike. The zoom lens is great for the low price that it is being sold for Digital cameras are going to put film companies out of buissness and now that I have a digital camera I can certainly see why. I first bought this camera because I was always looseing my film and prints. Now I am glad I did because I have already saved hundreds of dollars on not buying film. I use the pictures to put on my web site and to send to my friends. This is truely a great camera!
