            Let me begin this review by saying that I have test-driven a lot of sporty cars during the past few months.  (If you would like to go to my other reviews, check out my profile page.)  I have driven the Celica, Eclipse, Maxima, and BMW Z3.  Some of these cars I was impressed with, and others weren�t so lucky.  So what did I think when I drove the new 2001 Honda S2000??  Well, I was not that impressed overall.  

<b>Engine</b>
Let me begin, as I always do, by discussing the S2000�s engine.  Honda decided that it would be best to only offer one type of trim for this sports car.  The one model has an inline 4 engine with a stated 240 hp.  The max torque is stated at 153 hp at 7500 rpm.  Let me tell you, these numbers can be deceiving.  While I was driving the car, it did not feel as though it had a lot of power.  The redline is extremely high so most of the power comes when you really DRIVE the car.  I guess this could be good for racing, but for everyday use the power just doesn�t feel as though it�s there.  The acceleration was smooth and was not choppy at all.

<b>Handling</b>
This is one aspect in which the S2000 did shine.  Overall, the car handled very well.  The rear-wheel drive allowed the car take corners at a decent speed without any roll.  Every corner I took during the test-drive was hugged by the car with ease.  It was a lot fun to downshift before taking a corner and then accelerate into it.  Overall, I was very impressed with the way the S2000 handled.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of the S2000 was good, but not great.  There was not a lot of room because the car is a two seater.  But then again, what do you want from a sports car?!?  The controls are all well placed and easy to read.  Honda equipped the S2000 with a decent radio although it is less impressive when the top is down.  Leather is also available to make the car look even better.  Similar to other sports cars, there is basically no truck.  At most, you might be able to fit a briefcase or a couple grocery bags in it.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior of the S2000 is definitely what makes the car.  It is very stylish and will turn heads as you drive down the street.  The convertible is a nice addition and would be really nice to use during the summer when it�s 90 degrees.  A spoiler is standard equipment and definitely adds to the sports car feel.

The S2000 comes with 205/55R16 size tires which adds to the great handling.  The chrome rims add to the cars appearance.

<b>Reliability</b>
The S2000 is a relatively new car but so far reliability has not been a problem.  Honda is known for their quality cars and I would expect this to continue into the future.  One concern I would have would be the wear and tear the car would sustain if an aggressive driver redlined it at every stoplight.  Although the car�s redline is at 8300 rpm, I think the S2000 would suffer if a driver tested the redline continuously.  

<b>Price</b>
The S2000s sticker price is approximately $32,000.  There is a shortage of these cars so you might not be able to get one for this price.  I definitely don�t think you�ll have any bargaining power to get a deal below the sticker price.  Honda is just selling too many of these cars.  In my opinion, the S2000 is not worth the hefty price.  For 32k I would expect a V6 with a little more low end torque.  The S2000 is purely missing this.
