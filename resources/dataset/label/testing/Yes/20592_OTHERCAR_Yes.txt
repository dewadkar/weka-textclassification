            I bought my A4 in May of 2000 and have enjoyed every one of the 25k miles I have put on it so far. 

The Ugly -- This fast and nimble sedan suffers from two problems. One....I always want to drive above the speed limit in this car. It will take me to 70 mph in 4th, which is right about when the police pull me over. After one suspended license, I have given up on my lead foot tendancies and set my speed alarms much much lower.

The Second problem is service. This car doesnt need much...if any, but when it does...finding a good service center where you can get fast, friendly service is a royal pain in the posterior! I use the dealer where I bought my Audi and have regretted every visit. Finding a better service center is my most vexing problem with this car. The expense of service is not an issue as this car has an extended 6 year 100k warranty.

The Bad -- The mechanical problems I have had have been few and far between. 99% of my problems have been with my service center, not the car itself. Only one problem with the stereo continues to vex me, and that will soon disappear when I replace the stereo (which is under warranty).

The abscence of stereo controls on the steering wheel is also a problem. To change the radio/cd settings I am force to take my eyes from the road.

Finally the lack of rear passenger room is a minor problem. I rarely offer to take passengers with me, other than my wife, quite simply because I dont want to force them to scrunch up to fit. If I had wanted rear room I would have looked at the A6.

This is most certainly a two passenger car with room for your brief case in the back seat and golf clubs in the trunk.

The Good/Great! -- The ride for this car is solid and tight with a bit of road noise when on the city streets (pot holes and such).  I am happy to have purchased the sport package (sport wheels and turbo) rather than the winter package (heated seats etc..). The ability to scoot quickly is what I need for maneuvering through traffic. The A4 is quick off the start and can maintain strong acceleration though 5th gear (thanks to the turbo). 

The all wheel quatro has likely saved my life more than once. The advanced features of this automobile certainly enable me to be a more accurate and precise driver.

The interior is spartan, which I prefer. The clean leather is comfortable and solid. Having recently had back surgery I wanted a car that would treat my lower back as comfortably as possible and this car does just that. I have enjoyed 7 hour road trips with no back problems, which is a MAJOR plus in my book. Also...the fantastic leg room afforded the driver and front passenger (at the expense of all the rear leg room) is luxurient!

Will I buy another Audi? You betcha -- as this is my 3rd. Though I suspect that this is my last sport car. In 5 years I will probably buy the larger luxury class Audi (A8 level).

Cheers!
