            This is a wonderful car. I bought mine as a used car and it was still in wonderful shape it has way over 100 thousand miles on it and it still runs like a dream. This car doesn't require much maintnence. Does good on gas, and oil. Has good &quot;get up and go&quot; . runs smoothly when going down the road at any speed. This is a must buy car. If you are looking for a good car choose this one it also has plenty of space in front and back seats. Most have options such as power seats, power windows power steering and more.I really can think of nothing negative about this car, I really enjoy it. Parts are easy to get at any car parts place, also parts are not very expensive to aquire.<br><br>
