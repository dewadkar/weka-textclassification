            I bought this car because of the reputation it had at the time. I bought it in '96, it was one year old. I bought the Sport Coupe. The transmission ran very smoothly, clutch felt great. Steering was power assist and was very nice. The seats could have been much more comfortable. There was lots of room in the back seat for legs, but not for heads. 

The mileage was great, about 29 mpg. There were air leaks all around the car though. Mostly through the windows on the door, on which there was no metal frame for the glass. Made for a fairly noisy ride. The windows also leaked a little bit when it rained or I went through the carwash. I took it on several long trips and it did very well. It has good power, does well in the mountains and on the flats, it goes very fast :) 

It held up very well in the two accidents it was in. One involved the front passenger side, where the door meets the fender. It's all metal, which I didn't know. Held up great. The other was a rear end, driver's side impact, and it's fiberglass or plastic back there, so there was no dent, just paint scratches. Expensive to fix, if I hadn't have had insurance. 

All in all, a good car. I don't like the wind whistling through it, so I might not buy another one, but for reliability, I had no problems with it at all.<br><br>
