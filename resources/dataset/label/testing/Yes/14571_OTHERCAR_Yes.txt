            I couldnt be happier, I got this Sony digital camera for work to start with but after i used it a few times I descided to get greedy and  keep it.
To start with its a sony which means quality, and for a added bonous I got it at Walmart at a super buy (*under $300).
I never actually wanted  a digital camera but work ask to find one and after I got one I figured out  they can serve a purpose,especialy when your trying to show off a new toy or sell something threw ebay or just download your own picture.
I checked out 4 or 5 different cameras 2 of which was Sony brand and found out this one is the easiest to use even with the &quot;bad eye for taking&quot; pictures I have.
With all the extras like,built in flash, stablizing mode,special effects  added,and when you can easily erase any picture you take how can you go wrong, all you have to  do is point  and shot and if you dont like the picture you took erase it  and do it again.
So if your not sure you need or want one look at the bright side,buy it ,try it and if you dont like it return it, but i m almost sure when you get it you'll keep it but shop around you'll find a good deal.
Thanks for reading ,good day and good reading.........Mike(Columbus,Ohio)<br><br>
