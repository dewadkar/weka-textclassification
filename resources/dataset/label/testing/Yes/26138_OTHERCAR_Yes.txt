            I own a 99 Passat V6.  A lot of thought here are in comparison to my Passat.  I felt that it's only fair to inform you, ther reader.

I had to rent a car to go from SF to LV.  Budget gave me a 2002 Sonata with 5000 miles on it.  I've never been impressed by Korean cars before.

I drove this car a week, and clocked 1200 miles.  And I'm impressed by what this car can do.  It's not like any Korean car I've even been in.

The 2.4 liter in-line 4 did not have sufficient power.  The V6 version of the Sonata is 100cc less than my Passat in terms of displacement but claims to have equal power output.

The gear shift is smooth.  The way the gear shift is positioned is very intuitive.  It moves from P to R to N to D and that's it.  Once in D, push the lever right and you enter into tiptronic mode.  Hyundai calls it the Shiftronic (tm).

When shifting from 4 to 3 to get some engine braking, it's nice.  When shifting from 3 to 2, you can tell that there is a huge gap in gear ratio.  I attribute this to the fact that the box is a 4 not 5 speed.

The road from SF to LV is an interesting one.  It took the Hyundai through various terrains and I must say that the tiptronic kept me ahead of the herd.  ;)  (Any CHP/NHP readers here?)

Handling: feels like a sports sedan.  I negotiated some mountainous curves at 80 and it did very well.  This car only had 205/65R15 tyres on steel wheels.

My total MPG calculated over 1200 miles is 22.  Not impressive.  Maybe it's the way I drive.  ;)

The seats.  Simple, not sophisticated. Not electrical driven but I didn't get a back ache for 1200 miles.  Very very nice.

The standard speakers are very nice.

Trunk space is great, I took a lot of things with me to LV.

Fog lights came as standard and was useful when I drove across the desert at night.

I've been inside previous generations of Excels and Stellas and what nots from Korea.  This one is nothing like those.  The inside does not feel cheap.  It's not luxurious but definitely not cheap. 

The ride was quiet and this car is defintely a cruiser.
