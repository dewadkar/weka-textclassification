            I bought this car for commuting, w/60k on it, and it has run great for me.  Paid just $2100, so I think I got a deal.  The buyer was motivated since his next car was already on its way.  

True, the construction is somewhat flimsy, there is NO ROOM inside for anything besides YOU, one passenger in the front, and perhaps one passenger sideways in the back seat.  And, the general integrity of the interior is not that great.  But, for WHAT IT IS (a speck of a car that's cheap to buy and gets good gas mileage), it excels.  

One reviewer said it doesn't go in the snow, and I disagree.  I've been in the snow on it, in some BAD stuff even, and it handled better than I expected.  Perhaps that reviewer needs different tires.  

On the SUBJECT of tires, buying lower profile (175-70) tires will GREATLY improve the handling of this car.<br><br>
