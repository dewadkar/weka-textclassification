            OK, every magazine out there has reviewed the Odyssey and declared it to be the cream of the crop of minivans.  So I won't go into a detailed reiteration of what Car & Driver, Consumer Reports, etc have already said.  

I never thought I'd own a minivan. I've always driven sporty hatchbacks, starting with the VW Scirocco Wolfsburg Edition I bought right after college, and culminating with my Acura Integra GS-R. After I got married and we started planning to have a family, I figured maybe we'd get an SUV, or a 4-door sports sedan.  

But now that reality has appeared (in the form of a young child), I realize that minivans aren't that bad.  They're big enough to haul all the crap we need for little Ryan (strollers, portable cribs, toys, diaper bags, yada yada yada) and they handle better than SUV's unless you go off-road.  Suffice it to say that we're not off-road people. To top it off, minivans are cheaper to operate, insure, and maintain than SUV's, and they're safer in crashes.  And it doesn't hurt that the Odyssey is (IMHO) the best-looking minivan out there.

We've owned our Mesa Beige Ody for a week now.  The things that I really like are as follows:
*Seating position: high enough to see over just about everything.
*Stereo: Not bad for a factory unit. Some people have been upgrading the speakers with Polk or Pioneer coaxials, but I think the stock speakers will stay.
*Magic 3rd row seat: The magazines have covered it in detail.  It's really going to come in handy on vacations to the in-laws' house.
*Auto side doors: Just a really cool feature.
*Storage: Lots of cup holders & bins, and a huge glovebox.
*Ride & handling: Really smooth.  It's just an Accord with a higher center of gravity.

Our Ody came with the 225/60 Michelin Symmetry tires on 16" alloy wheels, which seems to be the norm.  I haven't driven it in the rain yet, so I can't say whether they offer decent traction in all weather conditions.  Likewise, living in Atlanta, I don't expect to need the traction control system or snow tires :-)

Options:
We bought the EX model, and had aftermarket leather  installed on the seats by Classic Soft Trim.  The total cost for the leather was $1200, whereas Honda wanted $1500 for their factory leather.  These seat covers are beautiful and very comfortable. They do support Honda's side air bags, in case you're wondering. I'll certainly have no hesitation to use aftermarket leather in the future. 

I plan to install the fog light kit from HandA Accessories for about $200 very soon.  After seeing pictures of the recent 125 car pileup in the fog in north Georgia, I want to ensure that we have this important safety feature.  

The only other options I might install would be the door edge guards and fender well guards. I'll buy them online to save money

All in all, I'm quite happy with this minivan. The dealer delivered it to our house, and we paid a fair price. We expect it to last a long time!
