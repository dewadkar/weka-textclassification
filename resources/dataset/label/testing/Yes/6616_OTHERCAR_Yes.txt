            I own a 94' Ram 1500 2wd. With a strict routine maintenance 
schedule (oil change,transmission etc..) my ram has ran "cherry" even now with 114,000 miles. There are a lot of pro's to this truck, however, it's got it's downsides' too. Comfortable seats and overall cab structure has helped me through my frequent long distant road trips. I have plenty room to stow a lot of equipment or gear I bring along in the truck behind the seats in the built in racks. 
The console not only acts as a storage area, but is one heck of an arm rest as well. My 94' ram upholds an appearance that has far exceeded my expectations. Even today people still comment me on "my new truck". I just go along with the impression the 94' gives them, not revealing it's age. The 94' has plenty to brag about and hard to kill, however, I can think of a few things to better this ride. 

It's got a rough suspension to it, when I run into a rough road I can feel every bump. The factory "U" joints on the drive shaft do not have servicing points to lube, and to change out a fuel filter you have to access the fuel tank to do so. I bought a fuel filter at the dealership for $30.00 and that was the only place I could find it as well.  

 So far I am very satisfied with the Holly fuel system under the hood and the mopar parts that keep this truck rolling.
