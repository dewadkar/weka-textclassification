            The Jeep Cherokee Sport is an affordable car that is a lot of fun.  I have done many things with this car and it has never let me down.  The handling on this car is superb.  I have been in some sticky situations and its responsive handling allowed myself to negotiate objects with ease.  This vehicle is rear wheel drive which causes the tires to spin after rain has just fallen and the oils from the road come out but this can be easily avoided by putting the vehicle in 4-wheel drive.  This car will take you anywhere and back without the worry of something going wrong.<br><br>
