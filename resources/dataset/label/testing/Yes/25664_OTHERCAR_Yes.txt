            My wife and I did not own a digital camera and we just had our first child. We wanted to send pictures to friends via email. We saw it and decided that we would give it a shot for that low of a price.

We were quite pleasantly surprised with the picture quality. The only reason I did not give it 5 of 5 stars is that it did not have a Zoom/Wide angle button. It does have digital zoom but it is awkward to use. The auto-focus is a bit slow, so it is possible to take the picture before it is focused. The camera has a green light in/on the view finder that will tell you when it has focused and it hasn't failed me yet. We mostly have taken pictures indoors and in dark conditions (indoors). I photo's came out great . The instructions were excellent and easy to follow. They were in English and in Spanish

I will highly recommend it to anyone who wants just a basic digital camera that takes good pictures. I would buy this camera for a teen or anyone who has little or no experience with digital cameras. There many camerasï¿½ that can do much more with better features but you will pay for them. This camera is a basic camera with all of its focus on picture quality. You will get great pictures that should be close to a simple 35mm camera in quality. You can even have the pictures put on photo stock at most Film developing stores (like Wal-Mart)


This camera has quickly become the generic family camera that we use around the house.
