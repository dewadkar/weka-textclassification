            <i>I added this just recently...I got into a car crash where a dude in a pick-up truck 'didn't see us' and rammed into the minivan at about 40-45 mph.  I saw him coming and was stopped to turn left, so I turned the wheel straight and tried to accelerate straight and out of the way.  I got up to about 15-20 mph, but the hit still was awful.  I have whiplash and some bad back spasms, but nothing awful and not normal for a crash like that.</i>

<i>I think what's interesting here is that the pick-up truck was totalled and is not able to be driven.  The minivan is 95% able to be driven since there is a slight bend on the axle, but it will run perfectly well.  We may have to get a new car since the insurance company won't likely support a 1994 vehicle with 193,000 miles on it!  God really protected us, and the minivan's structure sure helped.  I had 3 passengers, 2 way in the back.  They were fine.  I saw the accident coming, which probably caused my injuries since I was all tense.  What to learn from the accident?  These minivans are safe, even against big pick-up trucks!</i>

<i>Here's my general review:</i>

<b>It's My Car!</b>

  I proudly drive a 1994 Dodge Caravan and have driven it to school many a time.  Hey, I even took it to Prom with my date when I won Prom King!  The 1994 Dodge Caravan is worth your money unless it has over 175,000 miles on it...

<i>Negative Stuff...</i>

<b>Break-Break-down</b>

  After about 180,000 miles, and my car now has 193,000 on it, the transmission just leaks like a sieve, and we had to get it repaired and tightened, too!  This may be because of wear and tear, but none of the other cars that went over 200,000 miles really had much of a transmission problem like that.

<b>HEAVY SEATS!</b>

  You cannot take these seats out alone.  You have to have at least two people to carry them and unhook them from their latch on the floor of the car.  These seats are pretty comfortable and can be easily slept on.  I wouldn't recommend selling your bed for this, though, cuz they aren't 100% comfortable!

<b>No AC?</b>

  The air conditioning unit also broke down, but this occurred after about 125,000 miles!  It started leaking out the pressure cap and nearly flooded my engine one time after driving home, and under the speed limits!  The Pressure Cap in result had to be replaced, too.

<i>Positive Stuff...</i>

<b>Hot Handling & Steering</b>

  We have 5 vans and 1 minivan.  The minivan drives like a dream, especially compared to the bulky vans in our driveway just sitting there, jealous that I didn't drive one of them!  The handling is excellent!  I have test-driven other SUV's and compact cars, and this one has great steering and good shocks.  The shocks aren't the most powerful, but they are very decent.

<b>Reliability</b>

  This minivan has worked well for so many miles and continues to drive very nicely.  A few problems have occurred with age, but that's nothing compared to the 6 or 7 years we've had this minivan.

<b>SMOOTH ridin</b>

  The only time this car didn't have a really smooth ride was when my mom drove it into about a 2 foot pothole.  YEEOUCH!  That was not bubblin on em!  I was in the car and one of my friends in a back seat had his cup in a cupholder, and the car bounced straight up and the cup went flying up and spilled all over the minivan!  He just had to order the Jumbo Mountain Dew.  Silly rabbit.

<b>Pick-up</b>

  This minivan has peeled out before, and it was HOT!  I love this minivan!  It's so...pimp!  PIMP IT!  This car can accelerate from 0 to 30 in about 1.5 seconds.  That's GREAT for a minivan.

<i>Ah, the Memories</i>

  I still remember Track Practices when I peeled out in reverse out of my parking spot, peeled out again and drove up near my friends and acted as if I were having a seizure in the car.  Ah, the Memories!

<i>I'd Recommend this Phat Wagon, Boyee!</i>

  This minivan is SO HOT!  OH MY GOODNESS!  It's only like $6,000 now!  I can't believe that!  I would say that it's a bargain!  I can get about 26 MPG off it, and that's awesome for me.  I love this minivan, and you should get one of your own and support the Minivan cause.  Get a dose of Minivanity.  YEEYUH!
