            Now that I am in college and spend my days studying, talking with friends or partying I don't get to watch too much TV.  However, every time I turn on the tube, I saw these new Escalade commercials calling it the "most powerful SUV on the planet".  Since my family owns two SUV's I figured that while I was home for break I would take one for a test drive...


<b><i>Beauty</b></i>
The New 2002 Escalade is one of the most aesthetically pleasing automobiles that I have seen in recent years.  I was very skeptical of Cadillac entering the realm of the sport utility vehicle but they definitely took their time in doing EVERYTHING right.  

Inside, there are all the amenities that have given Cadillac its reputation for over 40 years.  The heated leather seats are a great little extra for those winter months.  The wood trim beautifully accents a console that had to have been designed by the NASA space program.  It also comes with the Onstar system which uses GPS.

The new escalade also comes with a 250-watt Bose sound system with an in dash 6 disc changer.  This is great for those who like to ride and be noticed even though you can't be too inconspicuous in such a great looking vehicle.  

There is also the third row seating that can be used when you are riding "deep" (lots of people).  The vehicle is spacious throughout and provides enough head room for even your tallest friends.  

<b><i>Brawn</i></b>
Now with all of these luxurious qualities, it still isn't easy to forget that the V-8 345 horsepower engine is the most powerful ever put in a stock SUV.  The acceleration of such a large vehicle is surprising.  Cadillac also provided the SUV with trailer hitch capabilities for those who haul campers or boats.

The Escalade second and third row seating can be removed when necessary but why you would want to is beyond me...

<i><b>Overall</i></b>
I think that the new 2002 Escalade is the best SUV available next to a Land Rover or Range Rover.  However, its luxurious qualities lessen the chance of using the vehicle for some typical SUV purposes.

There is a definite change in the role of the SUV.  They were introduced to be work vehicles with truck qualities but could seat more people.  Now they are becoming the flagship for the soccer mom, well to do, and professional athlete.  I am not complaining because if I had a choice cars, the Escalade would be high up on the list.

But if you're looking for an SUV with power and beauty, your search stops right here.... With the new Escalade.
