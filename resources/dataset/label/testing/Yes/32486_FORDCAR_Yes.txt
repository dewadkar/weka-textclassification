            **3/03:  Updated!  I have owned my SUV since the end of October.  It has overall been a WONDERFUL vehicle to own!!!  There have been a few things I have found though that I thought Ford could have taken care of....but they cut corners!  The first is the lack of light in the glove box.  The map lights and the center light does not cut it for helping to navigate through the glove box!!  The second being the lack of light on the vanity mirror on the drivers side.  I guess while I am at it, it also would have been nice to have individual controls for the heat/air conditioning for the back seat passengers.  Irregardless of these few comments, I still am loving it!  I decided to leave my earlier updated comments below so you can see what other challenges I have faced since I have had my Escape.  I still highly recommend it overall...I just think Ford could have given a few additional features that come standard with lower priced vehicles.  

***1/03:  Previous updates:  The few things that have occurred that I was concerned/upset about, in the end were mostly the result of a lack of educational material provided by the dealer/Ford.  Specifically, I was disappointed that I had no light to help me see in the back of my SUV...well guess what, it was there all along and no one pointed it out to me...I just happened to find it on accident!  Additionally, I discovered that I could not lock the doors in the back seat of the SUV...but I actually think this is a great thing if you have kids, that way they cannot lock you out of the car. I still find I have an extensive amount of room to store things.  I also discovered this evening that my seat belts are adjustable based on your height (as are the seats...complete power driver seat that allows you to adjust to your perfect ergonomic position...in conjunction with the adjustible steering wheel).  I am tall so this was a nice find!  One other thing that I learned that I was not happy about and was not resolved...I was under the impression that if I ordered Ford's Mach Stereo system, I would get their advertised MP3 system.  When I went to try to learn how to operate this stereo that I paid for, I was looking in my owners manual and discovered I did not get an MP3 player.  I got what they refer to in their owner's manual as an "Audiophile System".  I was really upset and called Ford's customer care number at 4 am only to be told that according to their records I had that system.  I contacted the dealership and was told they needed to research the matter further.  I later was informed that the Mach MP3 system was only available in the "Sport" versions which I did not get because I could not get a sunroof (which is well worth the expense as it opens with one touch and is huge!) with the "Sport" version.  The system I received in my car was a Mach stereo system but only in the sense that it has 7 speakers and a 6 disc changer...it was, like I had said previously, referred to as the Audiophile system in my owner's manual.  I did not like this because it lead to mistrust on my part with Ford.  I expressed these concerns to Ford and hopefully they will address them.  I would also have to agree with one of the other epinion reviewers about the ignition setup.  It is hard to find because the key is huge (it has a built in security system that prevents hotwiring your car) as is the entry point...and there is no light there to help the situation.  But really the negative marks are so minimal.  Other than that, my Escape continues to impress me and I thoroughly enjoy the way it drives!  In fact, probably too much!  I got my first ticket ever in my new car!=)  There are a lot of hidden features not discussed in the owners manual that are great, such as the light in the back of the SUV or the fact that you can still roll down your windows even if your keys are out of the ignition and the car is off (and this is for all the windows)...provided you have not opened the door yet.  Ford does offer an extensive customer care center you can call for the smallest questions (my example would be that I called to ask if the Armorall applied to my tires at a carwash would damage my side moldings since the excess was not soaked up and it sprayed everywhere when I drove my car home).  They investigate it like you were asking what to do if your car blew up.  I was really impressed at how patient they were and how they addressed my questions like everything I was saying was important.  Overall, I would say it the Escape is still an OUTSTANDING car!!!  I absolutely love my car and have no intentions of replacing it for a very long time!  It definitely is fun and perfect for many lifestyles!  Check it out!  And no, I don't work for Ford!=)**   

10/02:  I recently got my Ford Escape (I chose the XLT Popular 2; Options: V6, 4x4, side air bags, side step bars, Mach stereo, moonroof- my comments are all based on the version I got..there's also a lower end model..the XLS-which give quite a bit but is basic...and a higher end model...the Limited- which looks awesome and is extensively loaded-I don't know much about either of these models though).  It's my first SUV...I had an Integra before.  So first of all, the visibility is much better (that of course could just be an SUV thing).  The Escape drives smoothly and handles curves wonderfully (I am only going about 5 mph slower around curves I drove with my integra).  I barely feel bumps in the road.  The moonroof is super easy to use-first button touch you control where it stops, double touch it and it opens completely like your drivers window.  The Mach stereo system is incredible and well worth it...the sound is so great, you feel the vibration in the foot pedal if you listen to your music as loud as I do=).  All the dash board knobs/dials are easy to use.  The seats are wonderfully comfortable and supportive.  There's lots of storage cubbies in the front of the Escape for anything you might want to have with you...I don't have enough stuff to fill all the cubbies in mine.  There's two map cargo nets behind each front seat...that are generously sized.  There are also cubbies on the side of both the driver side and passenger side front doors.  I find the seats that fold down in the back easy to manuever (it increases your space in the back even more- reduces your passenger carrying ability though-usually 5 can be seated in the Escape).  There's lots of space in the very back of the car for groceries or whatever else you might buy.  There's a little storage bin inside the back as well...on the wall on the left side...it has a cargo net.  I use it for my dog's toys (it's not huge, but it's there and useful).  There's two outlets (one up front, one in the back) for you to charge up your cell phone or your computer or to plug in a camping light.  The roof rack is also extremely easy to use.  In fact, everything on the vehicle is pretty self explanatory.  I only had to pay $5 more to fill up my tank ($20 in CA) from what I spent to fill up my integra.  This vehicle is highly versatile- I have worn a suit in it comfortably and then on the weekend, grabbed my dog and went out and had some fun!  There's tons of leg room too for tall people (speaking from a tall person's perspective 5'8")....something that the RAV 4, CR-V and Santa Fe couldn't touch!  The power seat is also super easy to adjust to the perfect spot for your comfort.  My only complaint is the length of the gear shift...it does seem unusually long (a "con" pointed out by consumer reports) and at times can get in the way with the stereo.  Ok, one more complaint, I don't care for the horn beep to tell me the alarm has been activated...but very minor in the grand scheme of things.  The Escape is a great lil' SUV well worth it's cost!
