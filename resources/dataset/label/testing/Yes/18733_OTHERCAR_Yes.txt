                The Jeep Grand Cherokee is an excellent built sports utility. It out does the previous model by 110 percent! It has a super powerful V8 engine letting you tow or carry pretty much every thing imaginable!! Also a key feature of this car is its great looks this is often rare in SUVS. The interior of this car is as nice as the exterior maybe better. The front seats are roomy and comfortable with heated leather. The back on the other hand is small and cramped I just bought one and after spending a six hour drive in the back you really get to know all about it. The console in the middle is varnished walnut giving it a stylish look. Another improvement is that the spare tire is not just flopping around in the back like it used to now it has a special compartment for it under the mat. I just got a flat and heck it is so easy to put on the full size tire. The new Jeep is a spectacular SUV I recommend it for a family as long as you do not go on to long of a trip. It is a spectacular vehicle over all.<br><br>
