            Well, this is our like millionth vehicle and it belongs to my mom and she went from a 1991 Escort to a 1996 Taurus which is a dramatic difference and a huge change for her and I since I have to drive her car to work while my Volkswagen gets repaired.  Wow, this is probably the newest car my family has ever owned.  We got a very good deal on it because it has 160,000 miles on it, so after my mom traded her Escort in for $500 we bought the car for $2000 total.  Isn't that a deal or what!?!?  Absolutely clean without any problems or blemishes.  So many options with it, I cant even list them all but I'll try to.  Keyless entry, power windows, power locks, key chain remote with lock and unlock, trunk and panic buttons, alarm, a/c, cruise, tilt, adjustable temperature inside, electric seats, sunroof with tilt or open all the way, a light for like everything where your speedometer is like for example when you turn the key to turn the car the battery light, radiator, temp, and all those lights come on, theres warning lights for everything, even windshield wiper fluid!  Theres also, electric heated mirrors, 5 disc cd changer in the trunk, tape, am/fm, electronic heater controls, a button for outside temperature, dual exhaust (by the way this is the LX model of the Taurus, because theres at least 3 different models, GL LX and SHO, and all 3 are different somehow), ABS, a GREAT sound system which consists of 3 speakers in the back (a 6x9 in the middle for bass and 2 smaller ones on the sides), Q logic speakers on the doors by the dash which make a great difference in the sound, it adds a lot of treble for the crisp sound it gives, a child seat seatbelt in the back, a flip down arm rest in the back, very comfy seats in front and back, a very handy cup holder right by the floor shifter that you press on and it automatically pops out two cup holders, a huge middle console for your junk, and very easy, huge radio and temperature console placed in the middle of the dash.  Its huge and very, very easy to use!  I figured everything out in one day.  The trunk has enormous space and you could fit at least 5 or 6 big suitcases or 4 or 5 bodies in it and underneath the carpet there comes a full size spare tire instead of those little doughnut tires.  The cd changer has its own cover and case and you can store 5 cds in it to protect them.  The lights automatically turn on when you unlock the car with the remote or you touch the keypad.  If you hit the lock button on the remote, it makes a beep sound to tell you that everything is locked.  The remote reaches from very far away.  The only thing wrong with it is the Engine Service Soon light is on, but what do you expect for a car with 160,000 on it!?!?  This car has a very strong and sporty sounding 3.0 Liter V6 engine and it gets up to speed very quickly and smoothly. The tranny shifts smooth, without any hesitation and the engine runs like its supposed to.  Its easy to notice how it runs because I like to watch the RPM gauge.  This would make a great family car.  I mean its huge with a lot of ample space!!  The silver exterior is great because the outside can not rust due to the fiberglass type body panels instead of metal.  Would you rather have a fixable dent or a pain in the butt to get rid of rust spot(s)?  Easy answer.  My mom is a very lucky woman since she got a great deal on this car and the condition its in and to get rid of that horrible Escort!  She enjoys it very much and she has never liked any of her cars but this one since its trouble free.  Even though I'm not a domestic car fan, I highly recommend this car!
