            The first thing that attracted my family and I to this car is the sexy styling of it. This car is flat out beautiful. Not only does it look good, but its comfortable inside and the V-6 under the hood sure can move this car. My parents bought this after they test drove it. I am a part time driver of the car, which means I usually drive it about 10 hours a week, but that is no where near enough to satisfy my hunger to drive this ultimate machine. 

The seats are nice comfortable bucket seats, with a surprisingly roomy rear. The fog lights on the front valance make it easy to see at night and in fog. The sports suspension package makes this car a dream to handle in any conditions. I live in northern Indiana, and this car handles very good in the snow. I have had no problems with it sliding or anything in the snow last winter, and i'm looking forward to this winter. The car is exceptionally quick. It has a very roomy trunk. It gets good gas mileage, and the engine noise is very quite. The stereo is very good, my car has a cd and cassette player in it. 

I would say anyone interested in not only a good performance car, but a safe, reliable, and sexy car, will enjoy this car til they die. <br><br>
