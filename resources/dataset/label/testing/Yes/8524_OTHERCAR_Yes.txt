              To be truthful, my wife and I never thought we would ever own a full-sized truck. Our truck before this was a Toyota with over 250,000 miles.
  When it went belly-up, we looked around and made the mistake of driving this truck. After two months, the only thing we find bad with it is the gas mileage. But, we went from a four-cylinder to an eight. It corners better than our little truck, and is a lot more comfortable.
  If you're looking for a good multi-use vehicle, this truck fills the bill. If you want a truck to run around town in, I'd look elsewhere.<br><br>
