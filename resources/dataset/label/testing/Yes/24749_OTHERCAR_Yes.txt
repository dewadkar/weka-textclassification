            I purchased the S70 to cover both hobby travel snapshots and do close-up work in medical photography. Although I read various reviews of other products this was the only product that was both small (relative) and covered the range of exposure distances I required. 
As a long time user of SLR cameras, I felt the &quot;bulky&quot; description by one reviewer was over-blown. While smaller film and digital cameras are available with significantly fewer features, none offers the feature combination and photo quality I experience in this camera. My criticisms of the camera are two! The memory stick shipped with the camera is too small. I compare it to buying a car with a ten gallon gas tank and having to add a second after-market tank for long trips. I shoot images at a 1280x960 size and get 10-11 exposures on the 8 meg memory stick. For travel photography you need a pocket full of memory sticks or have a notebook computer with which to download images. The images are very good and compare quite well with 35 mm slides that I scan. The exposures are good and easily tweaked in Photoshop. It is difficult to illuminate macro subjects adequately. External lighting tend to obscure LCD screen. The built-in flash seems to be inadequate and the camera blocks external lighting sources in very short focal distances. I would love to see a ring light adaptation.This product will appeal to the 35mm photographers wanting a digital camera with many of the same features and the instant image turnaround these cameras offers.<br><br>
