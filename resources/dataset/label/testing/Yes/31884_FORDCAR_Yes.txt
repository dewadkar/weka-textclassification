            I bought a 1997 Ford Escort LX Sport.  Now, I live in Canada so all prices mentioned are in Canadian dollars.  I bought it from a friend of a friend for $10,000.  It's four doors, but still, it looks pretty sporty.  It has a rear spoiler, its a &quot;satin&quot; black.  The satin color gives it kind of a metallic look to it. 
This car has been great for me. It amazing on gas, it only takes 20 bucks to fill the tank.  
It doesn't have a lot of &quot;kick&quot; to it, but that wasn't important to me.  Although there is not a lot of kick, passing on the highways is no problem, it has enough to do that perfectly. 
There is one thing that has happened that I'm not too pleased with.  In the dash in front of the driver there is a sound coming from it. It sounds like something may be loose in there. It seems to be ok some days, but then other days, it's really loud and annoying.  The cold weather seems to increase the frequency of it.
Driving this car is very fun.  It's very smooth and very quiete.
People who should buy this car? STUDENTS WITH NOT A LOT OF MONEY.  Also, people with kids.  Its a great little family car. All in all, this car was worth the ten grand that I paid for it.
