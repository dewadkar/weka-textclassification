            I have really enjoyed my truck. It is only a two wheel drive but it has taken me every where I've wanted to go. Let me first start with what I <br>haven't liked. First, after I replaced my original tires (fire stone) with a <br>different brand (Discount tire store) they didn't grip the road as well. The <br>tires slip and squeal much easier than before.  My gas mileage is a little<br>lower than the dealer sticker showed but I am still getting 20 to 24 per <br>gallon.  I also would never buy a two seater again. But that was my own <br>fault.<br>Now for what really liked. <br>I have moved 4 times with this truck and have pulled a 20 foot trailer <br>loaded with furniture and once with 2 four wheelers and a motorcycle in <br>the trailer and another four wheeler in the back of the truck. It did just fine.<br>The truck sits higher then most other small size trucks and in my opinion <br>is the best looking truck out there. I have also pulled small boats and <br>hauled 1000 pounds of clay. ( Only because my wife offered our services<br>to the local ceramics teacher) The truck has been great for me as a full <br>time student. The only problem I've had is a blinker fuse that burns out <br>every 1 to 2 years. We've replaced  3, but at a $1.95 its no big deal.<br><br><br>
