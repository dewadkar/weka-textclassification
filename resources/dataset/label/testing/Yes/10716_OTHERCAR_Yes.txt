            To start of, this is one of my faverit cars, ever since i saw it going down the road. I'm refuring to the 93-96 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, the 96 inperticuler. When my grandparents where in the market for a new Cadillac I was right ther egging them on to buy this land yacht. I was not truly informed of this cars power until lately. That is just this week, my grand ma said that i could take here car to go grocery shoping at the local HEB. On my way, I was giving it some gas to see how well this thing really went. So at a stop sign, i floored it, the tires stared to spin then my foot was pushed off the gas and the Tractiuon Control light came on. After pulling over I found the button to disable the Traction Control. The next stop was at a light. When the light turned green my foot flew to the floor and i took off, I was maybe going 15MPH but the speedometer was saying 65MPH and the car was buy now in second gear, so I looked behind me and there was nothig but white smoke bellowing from the wheel wells. then i got traction and hit 60 again in under 8 seconds. The car is fun to drive while BIG, ther are a few bad points, but talk about fast. This car is for the family hotroder. <br><br>
