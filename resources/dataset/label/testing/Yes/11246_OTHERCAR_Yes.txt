            I bought the vehicle with 75000 miles on it. It was only $1600, which isn't a whole lot considering what the car has for options. It had almost very available option you could get from the factory, which includes the following:

-AM/FM Stereo w/ cassette
-3.1 Liter V-6
-4 Speed Automatic Transmission w/ overdrive
-Engine Block Heater
-Inflatable Rear Suspension
-Rear Window Wiper/Washer
-Rear Spoiler/Deflector
-Aluminum Alloy Rims
-Roof Rack
-Third Seat
-Power Windows/Locks/Seats
-Cruise Control
-Split Front Bench Seat
-Reading Lamps
-Optional Water Temp/Voltage/Trip Odometer gauges
-Eurosport Package

That's about all I can think of. Don't get me wrong, the car does have its faults. But it has given me 60,000 miles of trouble-free driving. Here's what I've put into it for repairs and maintenance:

-Scheduled Oil Changes $21.00
-Front and Rear Valve Cover Gaskets $9.00
-Front Upper Strut Mounts $45.00 ea.
-Brake pads, rotors, shoes, springs, wheel cylinders $250.00
-Oil Pan Gasket $18.00
-Four Wheel Alignment $35.00
-Two Tie Rod Ends $150
-Rear Shocks $26.00

Not all repairs are regular maintenance, but that is to be expected on a car that's 10 years old, considering how many miles have been put on it. It runs perfect, and has never failed to start. All in all, I am extremely pleased with my 1990 Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport.<br><br>
