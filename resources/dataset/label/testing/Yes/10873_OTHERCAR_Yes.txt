            I bought this 1997 SUV used about 3 months after my 1986 Honda CRX was totaled in 1998.  I decided I wanted a lot of car around me in the event of another such incident.  The airbags are a comfort as well.  This car is pretty much loaded as far as accessories - roof rack, tow package, leather interior, heated seats, power sunroof, keyless entry, power locks/windows/everything, etc.  which is quite the opposite of my previous vehicle. I also opted to take over the extended warrantee, and it is extremely comprehensive.  Its a really good deal.

I don't mind driving now, and the upkeep has only been maintenance thus far.  I can comfortably take 5 adults places, and once I bought a dog gate, my husky fits nicely in the back (though she hates being by herself back there!).

I have heard a few stories about it - I know a guy who hydro-planed and rolled his, which totaled the car, but he was not hurt badly.  I have heard that is because it is one of the lightest SUV's on the market.  I have experienced hydro-planing in it myself, with no accidents.  I am extra cautious in the rain, but that's just common sense anyway.
I got a great price on a great car, and couldn't be happier.<br><br>
