            Mazda Miata: a True Roadster. This little car has excellent gas mileage and good suspension. Mazda did well with this. There are only two problems; the car needs more legroom and more power. I suppose I should have known that by purchasing a roadster that I would be un-comfortable... but FOR REAL! Iï¿½m 6' tall and when I drove the car I had to duck down and slouch in my seat to prevent my head from being over the windshield... I suppose if you were 5'8" it would be ok. The car has a small enough trunk as it is (not useful at all)... My opinion: take in the trunk another 2 or 3 inches and add to the legroom. Another problem: no power. This pitiful engine is NOT made for a true roadster. I think maybe Mazda ought to take some hints from VW about constructing a 1.8 turbo engine that will get at it! The radio is slightly underpowered. Once you go over 80 with the top down, you cant hear squat. Otherwise, the car is a-ok.
