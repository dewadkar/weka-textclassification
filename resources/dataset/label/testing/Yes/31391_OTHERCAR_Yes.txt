            I am a truck man.  who need a new ride, one that would fit all of my friends.  My 3 seater truck couldn't do that, so i looked around.  I looked mainly for a car that i could fit in, play some tunes, and get away with.  This is it.  I got it used at a lower price than this site projected and i have had it for 4 months now and still don't have any complaints.  if you need a good car you should really look into this one.  Get it!  It drives well, and at great speeds.  The sound quality of my combination tape/cd player is killer.  I love it, what else do you need to hear.
