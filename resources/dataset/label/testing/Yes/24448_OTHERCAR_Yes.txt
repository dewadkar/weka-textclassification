            I looked on the web, I looked in the stores, I read all of the reviews.  This was the best camera on paper and now it has proven itself to me in person.  If you are in market for a digital camera - its for you.  

Why did I buy it.  On paper it might be expensive ($493-529) but if you really look at the other cameras with similar features - you won't get the following:  AC Adapter ($59+), 3x optical, USB, LI-ION rechargeable battery (no one has this), 2.1M pixels, attachments for UV filters and zoom/panoramic lenses just like an expensive 35mm.  Not to mention the cool view screen with windows like controls.  

Plus Sony's memory is the cheapest on the market.  No-way you say - Sony always has the most expensive accessories - not anymore.  I got a 64MB Memory stick for $109 and extra battery for $59.  Any other camera I looked at including the Canon S10 the Kodak 280 or the Olympus were more expensive.  If you add up the camera price, ac adapter, batteries, memory you will pay more and get less.  I challenge anyone to disprove this.<br><br>
