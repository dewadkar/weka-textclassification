            The Lexus GS430 is truly a winner in the luxury sport sedan battle. This very competitive market needs an amazing car to separate itself from the others, and this car truly accomplishes that goal - even surpasses it.
 Not only is the MSRP of this car much lower than that of a loaded BMW 540i, it has more power. BMW may boast their historical name of prestige, but that just goes to show you how good the Lexus would have to be to steal its fame in only 11 years. 
 The GS430 is a true sports car in 4-door disguise. With its smooth, laser-precise 5 speed auto shifting gears automatically, you can effortlessly put the 300 horsepower to the road. The luxury is also superb. Nearly silent when cruising, this car would make the Mercedes S-class shiver in its overpriced boots. Most of the luxury passed on from the LS430, it is not just a road rocket. Turn the ignition and the wheel moves into place and the electroluminescent instrumentation light up, revealing their 150 mph limits, accessible at the punch of the gas pedal. Creamy soft leather, an amazing audio system, and controls exactly where you would expect them. Precise temperature control, and ergonomically a dream. Personally I prefer the interior over the BMW 5-series and Mercedes E-class. While they may be focused on luxury (mercedes - unless you fork over twice the money for the AMG), and sport (BMW 5-series, "not for rear seat passengers"). And the red instrumentation in the BMW is race worthy, but is uncomfortable on long drives. But the Lexus combines the two in the best of both worlds. It may not have the pure adrenaline-inducing cornering and G-forces as the BMW, but with more horsepower and more luxury, it can give the Bimmer a run for its money at the red light and transform to a suave cruiser on the highway, still leaving you an extra 10 grand in your bank.
