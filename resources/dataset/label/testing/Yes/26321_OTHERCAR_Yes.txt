            GREAT car! I love it! I just recently bought a 2000 EX Civic this past May and I couldn't have picked a better car!  The EX is the loaded model, and I got a red one with charcoal interior.  It has keyless entry, sunroof, auto everything, CD Player, anti-lock brakes, you name it.  I am a college student about to graduate in December, and ended up wrecking my old car before I was ready to take on a big payment, but also didn't want to get a junker since I was so close to graduation and would be making money SOON. But, the Civic EX is still nice enough and reasonably priced, that I was actually able to get something that I will love driving.  It handles really well and gets awesome gas mileage.  Plus, I do love the reputation they have for dependabilty!  Honda also has a great extended warranty you can buy to cover any maintainance you may run into for a long time, supposing you will need it.  <br><br>
