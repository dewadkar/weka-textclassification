            Bought it brand new in August of 1998, when they were pretty desperate to unload the unsold ones. Window sticker was $12,250, but the final out-the-door with tax, license, postage &amp; handling was $10,761 - not really too bad for a car with 3/36 warranty and 125 horsepower!

Just like everybody else here - I gotta remark on the amount of recalls and warranty work the Kia has required so far. A failed oxygen sensor at 2200 miles, a clutch master cylinder problem at 4500, and new front brake rotors at only 8500 miles are NOT encouraging signs.......they WERE free, however, and the car has never failed to start, or broken down and left me stranded!

The front seats are MISERABLY uncomfortable for me - but I'm 6'2&quot; 230 lbs., and have had TWO back surgeries already, so YMMV! My 'other Kia' (a 1993 Ford Festiva, made by Kia) has the MOST comfortable seats of any car I've owned besides my Volvo, though.......

All in all, I don't hate this car NEARLY as much as Consumer Reports(TM) does, and could advise others to buy one if price and warranty availability are among your major requirements - just don't expect Toyota quality and Honda resale value!!! 

UPDATE!!!!! (and what timing!) Just ONE day after submitting my review, what should appear in my mailbox but ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE!!!! This is the one for the fuel tank ORVR valve, which doesn't surprise me at all - this car has always been VERY difficult to fill with gas, no matter WHAT technique I've tried........ <br><br>
