            I bought my Stratus used in June of 2000, and since I have put over 23,000 miles on it.  The only problem I have had was the rear defroster didn't work when I bought it(which the dealer quickly replaced).  Overall I love my car, with the exception if the cup holders in the front (I often have to use the back ones).  The 4cyl engine is powerful enough for everyday driving situations, and the car is a lot of fun to drive.  It also drives well in the snow.  I would recommend this car to anyone, but if you are over 6 feet tall you may have some trouble seeing traffic lights due to the cab forward design.
