            I won my Mustang GT in the Ford Mustang 35th Anniversary Sweepstakes.
I received the affidavit by registered letter on Christmas Eve 1998.
Talk about a great present! I picked up my car on February 2nd, and
I've put 25,000 miles on it since then.
This car is really a joy to drive. It handles great and has PLENTY
of power. This car even sounds great. The 1999 and 2000 models have
returned to what a Mustang should look like. 
The front seats are comfortable, but the back seat is for small  
children and people who have been begging for a ride only. 
The trunk is roomy, but the opening to it is small. Several small items will fit, but not large items. A nice feature of the trunk, is the ability to lay down the back seats for long items. 
If you want an affordable sports car, the Mustang GT could be just what you're looking for.<br><br>
