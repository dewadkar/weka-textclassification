            Well, if this is going to be your only car then beware... The trunk is small, the ride is harsh, road trips are hell, the top sometimes leaked on the edges, you can't see the stoplight with the top up, and you are dwarfed by the many sport utes around. 

But that is not the point. This car is fun. End of story. It is a toy meant to be taken out on spring or fall days, drive hard, and oh yeah, take the top down. I found myself just looking the other way when my golf bag had to be thrown in the front seat due to lack of room in the trunk(even when it was empty). There was no where in the interior to put a lot of things, did not care. 

This car cornered very well and the acceleration of the 4-cylinder engine was...well, left something to be desired. But when all the factors were taken in, this is a sports car and that is what to expect. Darting off to two lane country roads in the hills were always a prospect to cheer one up.

Reliability was never an issue.  This car never had given me any problems.

My only recommendation if you are thinking of buying this car is to think about what is important in life to you. If you are willing to deal with such nuisances as above described with a smile because of the top-down payoff, then it is a winner.
