            I was immediately intrigued with the Jaguar S-type when I saw it at the auto show in Cleveland. My trepidation came from memories of pushing the products of British Leyland which in the end permanently damaged my back. No more English cars I promised myself.

However, the Austin Healy 3000 that did it to me, I think, is one of the best looking cars ever built. The S-type was a nod in the same direction, with one difference - Ford. I couldn't imagine Ford owning a vehicle that craps out after driving through a puddle. So with trepidation, I bought a S-type with the 4.0L V-8. 

After two years of drenching rain, hail, heat, dust, every type of weather thrown at it, this Jag has not only never failed, it has never faltered. 

I don't get to drive it much, because my wife has taken it over, but when I do drive it, it is a superb handler on the highway. This car is fun to drive - it is tight, fast and sure footed. And another dimension that I don't read about in other reviews is the turning radius - this car has the tightest turning radius of any car I have ever driven. The best is when I drop my wife off at church and pull into a short break in a line of parked cars where the church driveway is, other cars doing the same thing block the curb lane, I pull all the way in, allowing traffic to move in the curb lane, and when traffic clears, I don't have to back up to clear the parked car just ahead of the driveway, I pull right out.

Another remarkable feature is the navigation system. My wife had to make a number of residential deliveries into neighborhoods she was unfamiliar with, for political campaign purposes. She just programmed the addresses into the navigation system, and the navigation to each house was perfect. We have also successfully used the navigation system to find restaurants we are unfamiliar with - as a matter of fact we have come to depend upon it.

My trepidation is gone - this car is a real performer, fun to drive and when you get it out on the interstate on a long drive, it is like silk with nice growl.
