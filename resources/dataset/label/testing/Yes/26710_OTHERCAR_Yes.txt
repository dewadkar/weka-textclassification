            I researched this one long and hard. I set a price of $200 dollars and as usual wanted the best. I looked at many sites, compared actual pictures, looked at features, etc. Here are some sites for research.

And what I decided is that some people don't know what there talking about. Once more, I also decided that some don't know how to take pictures.

I would never call myself an expert but I have experience with both 35mm and digital cameras - both at work (civil Eng. Tech) and at school (Graphic Design Major). And this camera is PERFECT. I did get a great buy at $220 with tax. Our cameras at work are Kodak but they cost much, much more. Remember, I'm a miser.

This camera is good for beginners and will grow with you. I've set it on auto and given to the kids plus I've used it in some tricky lighting situations for more creative affects. It's GREAT.

Its not fixed focus so you will have to push the button halfway down to focus and then the rest of the way to take the pictures. This is typical of all auto-focus cameras.

The higher the picture quality settings the longer it takes to write the picture after its taken. I set mine on SHQ and it will write 18, 1280 x 960, JPG files at a good rate. This was plenty for me. I didn't see any reason to by additional SmartMedia cards. It will also take panoramic photos and at it highest setting take 2 large TIFF images.

Battery life is good and it came with a set of rechargeable batteries. I don't use the LCD screen that much - it saves on batteries but I do check my pictures after I take them to see if I'm going to keep them.

I've heard people complain that it doesn't have USB capability but when I hooked it up to my computers COM port and downloaded the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised there too. It wasn't slow at all. I had thought of buying a USB adapter but after using it I don't think I need it. A full card takes only 10 minutes and I don't think that slow if compared to writing a CD in 10 minutes or waiting for web pages to load on a 49kb connection speed. I've got plenty of time.

The software that came with it installed with no problems and worked the first time. It is very intuitive but it is not a high-end graphics-editing program. I already have one of those. It seemed sufficient enough though for touching up some bad pictures and having fun with the good ones.

My recommendation is to buy this little jewel and take as many pictures as you can. You will become familure with its capabilities and your pictures will improve. Like they told me in Photography Class - The secret to taking good pictures is to take allot of them.

Every camera has a sweet spot based on the flash range and focal length of the lens. This camera has a big one - from inches to about 10 feet. In this range pictures are perfect of people if focused properly. If your looking for a camera, look at these things (flash range and focal length) they are very important and the 360L does a good job. Sure a zoom would have been nice but that would have cost at least another $100.

I took a bunch of pictures to Wal-Mart and printed them on the Kodak Picture Works Print Station and they came out great at 4 x 5. I could have probably got bigger prints but I wanted three different pics on one sheet. It cost $5 a sheet no matter how many or what size. You couldn't tell them from a 35mm.

I found the lowest price on the Internet for this camera and then my wife shamed Wal-Mart into price matching it. I got a great buy. Some places on the Internet still list it at about $300.

The only thing I'm going to buy additional is another set of rechargeable batteries - $12 at Wal-Mart. That way I'll always have a fresh set to take great pictures.
