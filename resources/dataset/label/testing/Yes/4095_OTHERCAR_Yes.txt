            I recently purchased a 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue from a good friend of mine.  I'm usually very skeptical about buying cars directly from other (private) owners, but I know she took good care of the car.  When I took possession, the car had 37,000 miles on it, and it still doesn't miss a beat.

The interior is roomy, but uses the space efficiently.  There is no sense of wasted area or extravagant design inside:  you feel like you're in a well-built people mover.  And that's just what this car is.  The '98 models have a slightly larger V6 engine than the more recent models, but it is slightly less powerful than the newer version.  Nevertheless, the V6 still drives this fairly large car very well, and while you won't blow away your friends in a drag race, you can feel the power when you accelerate.

As far as maintenance and upkeep, the Intrigue has a good record for being problem-free, with a few exceptions.  AS has been noted by several auto reviews, the radio/tape player/CD player buttons have a tendency to get very hot to the touch, especially when running the A/C.  I've heard this happens when you run the heater, as well, but I haven't touched that yet.  Also, the car seems to make some strange ticking noises after you cut off the engine.  I'm told this is the sound of the car cooling off, but I have my doubts.

Overall, for the money you can't do much better than the Intrigue.  The Camry costs more and gives you just as much muscle and luxury.  It really comes down to a matter of personal preference.  I also found the Intrigue to be a bit more stylish on the outside than the &quot;me-too&quot; cars like the Camry.  I'd heartily recommend this car to anyone who needs to haul family around, who wants to ride in comfort, and who generally wants to get the most bang for their buck.<br><br>
