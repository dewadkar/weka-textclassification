            I compared the top 5 selling minivans before selecting the Quest. (The quest is not in the top 5 but should be!)
The first thing that hooked me was the abundance of standard features. The base model is equipped with power locks and windows, Cruise control, Dual sliding doors, AM FM Cassette player, Steering wheel radio controls, Floor mats, cargo net and a VCR with flip down TV screen for the kids on those long drives. (At Toyota, the Sienna started at 5,000 more stripped down without even floor mats)
I added rear Captains chairs, dual AC, Roof Rack, Cargo shelf, Towing package, Running boards and more and was still below the base price of a toyota. 
The interior is very accessible with spaces to store everything.   Tons of cupholders in every row, and the seats reconfigure in several ways to provide more passenger or cargo room. 
The seats are very comfortable. I had no driving fatigue after a 5 hour trip. In the Mazda MPV, I got a backache from the test drive!
The only con is that it is smaller than the Toyota Honda& Dodges, but it is so comfortable that you hardly notice. 
The Van drives like a dream. It has great pickup, decent gas mileage (about 20 in the city) and handles like a car.

My van is loaded with comfort features and with no trade, we walked out the door at $23,500. I would absolutely recommend this van to anyone and will buy another one when I am through with this one.  I think I got the best deal in town!
