            When my wife and I set out to replace our five-year-old Taurus, we wanted more room. But she didn't want an SUV and I'd hitchhike before signing on for a minivan. So we decided to check out station wagons, and it wasn't long before we got hooked on the Volvo V70AWD. We've put 3500 miles on it and absolutely love it.

PROS:

The car is small enough to maneuver rings around SUVs, but feels strangely bigger on the inside. It's hard to reconcile the roomy interior with the car's actual diminutive street profile, not so different from a Civic really. Acceleration with the 193hp light-boost turbo is smooth and strong. Handling is precise and direct -- the car is very responsive, giving good road feel. The V70 powers through rain and glop with absolute solidity; with the full-time AWD you feel very safe. I've driven Crown Vics, etc., much bigger cars, that don't track as well. You always feel you're in complete control and the car's not going to go wandering on you. 

Road feel is active, as with any good European chassis. But if you've been wallowing along in an American sedan it takes a little getting used to -- the car is really taut. 

The seats are just wonderful -- wish I had 'em in my living room. Gas mileage is a reasonable 18mpg in mostly-suburban driving, 24 or so on the highway. And the overall quality feel inside the car is very seductive. After a couple of months in the V70, when you climb into someone else's Ford Explorer and face all that ill-fitting, rattly plastic, you get an immediate headache.  

The standard equipment list is long and includes anti-lock brakes, daytime running lights, front- and side-impact airbags... a raft of safety equipment. We added leather, roof rails, cargo area cover, wood dash, shift knob and wheel, and a visor-integrated garage door opener. CD player is an extra-cost option -- it should be standard. 
 
CONS:

There are a few. First is price -- around $35k for all-wheel-drive V70s, which is admittedly expensive. You have to believe Volvo solidity and lifespan will be worth the price. It had better last as long as three Fords. 

Other gripes: on cars like ours with the VolvoGuard alarm system, there's no tailgate lockset. You flip up the flap that covers the lock location and there's just an ugly plug of black plastic there. Volvo deleted the lock because too many owners were opening the tailgate without silencing the alarm first and setting it off by accident. Now you have to use the keyless-entry keyfob button to unlock the tailgate, so if the battery dies, you're in tough shape. 

The biggest issue we've found so far is a design flaw relating to airflow and the car's shape. At speed, if you crack either rear-seat window a couple of inches, an unnaturally loud and very annoying wind effect buffets your eardrums. Solution: override the rear-window controls from the driver's position, prevent child from opening them.

And you can't get a manual shifter with AWD in the States -- shame.

THE COMPETITION:

There's not enough wagons out there! We looked at the Ford Taurus, the VW Passat, the Subaru Outback, the Audi A6 and the Saab 9-5. The Ford was intolerably ugly and cheaply built, and our prior Taurus hadn't exactly been a quality leader. The VW was nice enough but barren-feeling inside and felt small to boot. The Subaru was expensive for what you get (in the high $20s with options), the dash felt plasticky and unfinished, and the back seat was small and hard and inhospitable. The Audi was a very nice car but too masculine and sinister-feeling, at least according to my wife. And the Saab was nice too, but full of finicky overengineered bits that we couldn't imagine lasting for years and years; we had reliability/cost-of-ownership concerns. Couldn't rise to the Benz or BMW wagons, so the V70 was the obvious choice.

ADDED NOTE:

We bought our V70 using Volvo's European Delivery Program. If you're planning a European vacation, this makes great sense. Below-dealer-invoice vehicle prices are fixed by Volvo Cars International and viewable on the Volvo website. You get the car built expressly for you with only the options you want -- and some that are hard to get in the States, like a wood steering wheel or the Euro-style roof rails. You pick up the car at Volvo HQ in Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo throws in a plane ticket to Europe and, when your holiday is over, ships the car anywhere in North America for free. 

The drawbacks of European Delivery include the payment plan -- they want all their money 30 days PRIOR to delivery -- and, after you fly back to the States, waiting six to eight weeks to be reunited with your car. But it makes a great adventure and you get to hang your Swedish license plates on your garage wall at home.<br><br>
