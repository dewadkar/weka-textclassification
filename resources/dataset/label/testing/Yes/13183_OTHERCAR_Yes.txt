            OK, here's the deal, my wife has this 2-seater sports car and she keeps crashing into snow banks.  So with the blizzard of 2003 approaching, we relegated the 2-seater to summer car duty and got a Santa Fe!

We looked at Jeep Liberty, Saturn Vue and Hyundai Santa Fe.  The advantages of the Santa Fe over the other 2 were numerous.  The GLS 4-wheel standard includes: full time AWD, power windows/locks, A/C, AM/FM CD and cassette with six speakers, anti-theft alarm system, cargo cover, fog lights and front/side airbags.  It also has an incredible warranty of 60,000 miles or 5-years bumper to bumper, 5-year roadside assistance, and a 100,000 power train (dealer told me this was to dispel quality issues associated with Hyundai from years ago).  All of this for a sticker of $21,399.

There aren't many options available.  I opted for anti-lock brakes, mud flaps, roof rack cross rails.  With destination, this brought the sticker in at $22,744.  

The drive is good.  Turns well and handles OK as it is built on a car frame.  Used it to go out in the blizzard and it handles real well in the snow - we didn't get stuck anywhere!

I like the comfort of the seats.  We got cloth instead of leather (LX has leather standard).  This is because it is kept outside and leather in the bitter cold is, well, bitter cold.  It has 6-way manual seats.  I guess automatic would have been nice but isn't offered on the GLS that I am aware.

The standard radio is a nice standard touch.  ALthough it says "Monsoon", it's from Clarion.  Quality of the sound is only OK, but acceptable.

The exterior has a good look.  Only complaint to date is that there is a whistling sound that can be heard when you hit 40 MPH.  According to the dealer, this happens when they put the crossrails option on backwards which is exactly what they did.  A little annoyed but not a big deal.

The power of the engine if a little underwhelming.  Typically you wouldn't notice that except when you speed up to get onto a highway.  

OK, now for pricing, they will try to put a market equalization "premium" on it.  With minimal negotiation, I got them down to $200 over invoice plus another $500 for the advertising fee.  I think I could have done better by using CarsDirect as it looks like they would have gotten for me $300 cheaper.
