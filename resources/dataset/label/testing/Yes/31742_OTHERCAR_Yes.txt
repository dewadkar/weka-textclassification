            My brother in law, cousin, and father in law all had the older model intrepid so we knew it had a good track record.  We fell in love we the new model design that came out in 1998.  This car handles well on the road and accelerates smoothly and fast.  We have the ES so it has a slightly larger engine then the base. For such a large car we get about 27 to 30 miles a gallon, which I think is very good.
The trunk room still seems to amaze me.  I think I could fit my house in there (just kidding)  but it is very very roomy.
The only drawback so far on this car is the windows.  The windows are a bit curvy and apparently this is hard on the motors so Dodge has had to replace the motors in the windows allready.
But it was great customer service even gave us a rental while we were waiting for the parts to come.
