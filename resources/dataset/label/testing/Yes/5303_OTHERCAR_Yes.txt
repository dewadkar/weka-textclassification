            Okay, I admit that I am prejudice, but after owning 8 Hondas, frankly there is nothing else I would consider for the money. For that matter, this 1998 EX V-6 Sedan couldn't be a better car for more money!

Talking about getting your money's worth, this vehicle gives it all to you and more. Many of you have owned a Honda, and most have been happy with your purchase. Not only am I pleased, but this V-6 is one sweet engine.

Prior to buying this car, I owned a nice, sporty Civic EX Coupe in black, with all the goodies....sun roof, cd player, fancy wheels...it got me through the &quot;turning 50&quot; crisis. It was a great vehicle, but one day it met it's demise in the path of a BIG Ford truck. I loved that car, but although it was totaled, I walked away with a few bruises. Hondas always do well in crash testing, and I am here to tell you that I am living proof. Of course, wear your seat belts.

So, it was shopping time. We thought we might be different this time, and checked out the Acuras. They were okay, but being Honda lovers, we were drawn to the local dealer. I liked the new styling, and much more interior room. This couldn't be a &quot;small&quot; car. The Honda dealer didn't want to deal (see my article on how to buy a car), so we went down the road. 

As we drove by the Mercedes dealer, we saw a sexy black sedan sitting on the used car lot. Ummmmm, this has possibilities. As I always drive standard transmission vehicles, and this was an automatic, I wasn't so sure. However, what I found was pure luxury. Perfect appointments, lush leather interior, a 7 cd changer, sun roof, power everything. Next step, the test drive. Gee, that V-6 is nice! It has great pick-up, the rpm's run very low, and it can get up to 80 without you evening knowing you are going that fast. The V-6 is so quiet that sometimes you don't realize the engine is on. Okay, this was the car. It had been traded in on a Mercedes, and only had 5,000 miles on it....so we bought it.

That was almost two years ago. Are we happy? You bet! Honda makes a terrific product, and a safe one, too. If you are a diehard Honda lover, you will understand, and if you've never owned one, try it. You might just love it! <br><br>
