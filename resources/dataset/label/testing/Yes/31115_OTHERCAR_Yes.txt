            This was my family's first SUV.  After two severe winters in our area we decided it was time to get a 4x4.

Appearance:
The Cherokee is a very old design.  The exterior is boxy and the interior is dated.  However, in Bright Red paint with a nice pair of alloy wheels this Cherokee is also no ugly duckling.

Performance:
The powerful I-6 engine provides for brisk acceleration and merging.  However, it is coarse in its delivery, and always let's you know it is there.  The handling is pretty good, and it will never be confused for a sports car, either.  However, you never feel as though it is unwilling to make the next curve.  Body roll is kept in check, but the steering is very light and provides little road feel.  Braking is good with little pedal travel and a nice firm feel.  The ride is better then expected.  Our Cherokee was purchased with the &quot;off road&quot; package which meant stiffer springs and shocks.  Still, the ride is compliant and never jolts you around.  

Interior:
The front seats are narrow but well cushioned, and many people have commented on their comfort.  The seat belts, though, are rather short and some of our larger friends can't get the belts around themselves. The rear seat is cushioned well but has a low back, shallow seat, and is flat as a board.  The interior needs a bit of updating but every nob and button is within easy reach, and is easy to operate.  The cargo area is rather large but the spare tire takes up a lot of space.

Reliabilty:
The car now has over a 100,000 miles on it and has never been taken to the shop.  The minor repairs it did need were taken care of at home. The one major problem we did have was a leaky front windshield.  The original windshield was cracked by a rock and ever since then the new windshields always leak.  We have had the windshield replaced 3 times to try and stop the leak but no luck.  The water travels down the inside of the dashboard and collects on the floor.  A little extra caulk around the outside of the window has helped the problem, but it still occurs in bad storms.

Overall:
The Jeep is a good vehicle and has no mechanical problems during its stay with us. It is a good car that is great for true off roaders or those who want to get through really deep snow.  Besides the window leak it has proved to be a good care and has transported my family for many years with very little problems.<br><br>
