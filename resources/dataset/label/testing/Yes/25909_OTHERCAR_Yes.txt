            I went shopping for a new digital camera after extensively using a less robust Olympus Camedia.  My first camera was great for the price but I was ready to upgrade to something with more functions as well as something I can expand with new lens.

So I searched and searched....and let me tell you the decision is not at all easy.  There are so many great cameras on the market.  After several weeks, I finally decided on this one.  

Here is a quick and dirty low down.

<b>Image</b>
Quality of image is good.  Pictures are clear and crisp and color realistic.  I dont have much to say in this department because I dont think ANY of the high end cameras will have a problem in this department.


<b>Batteries</b>
Olympus seems to be the only brand that still is considerate of the average guy (or girl in this case) who doesnt want to have to worry about the camera batteries being charged before picking up the camera and shooting.  For this camera, like others in the line, you can use regular AA batteries (4) or NiMH batteries.  After the included batteries run dry, I always opt for the duracells since that is so much easier to maintain and always have a fresh set ready.  My old Olympus had serious battery usage problems but this model has definitely improved.  Thus far, Ive used it on a few occasions for a total of 100 shots and a few mini movies still have full batteries.

<b>Features</b>
Apeture and shutter speed priority settings can make for some very intersting photos for one who know how to manipulate it for desired outcome.  Right now, Im hit or miss but I hoping to master it soon.  Since this particular feature is relatively easy to configure, an amatuer like me will have no problem trying their hand and becoming more proficent.

Movie mode with sound is definitely a fun and even useful feature.  When I purchased the camera, I didnt see how I would want or ever use it but I have already been able to capture a few seconds of key events with this mode.  For example, at a wedding I was able to capture the rose petal toss quite effectively instead of just snapping one or two photos.  At the very least, its fun!

<b>Size</b>
Small enough to put in a small purse but too large to carry around in my pocket.  A little on the heavy side for me but I accustomed to much smaller cameras.  

<b>Included Accessories</b>
I mentioned the batteries above: If you want rechargeable, you will need to buy your own.  There is not doubt that the 16MB included memory card is just ridiculous - you definitely need to upgrade. Lens cap with strap is key and included.  

<b> User Manual </b>
Really pitiful and barely worth the paper its written on.  An included CD has a lot more information but I find not having it in black and white to be a chore.


There are a number of other features/points that this camera addresses that I will not mention because I simply dont use them or have a point of reference to speak about.
