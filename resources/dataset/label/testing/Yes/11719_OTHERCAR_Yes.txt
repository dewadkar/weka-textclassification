            1.) Why did I buy it?

This is my first digital camera, I bought it because I need it for my summer vacation, and I need one with great image quality so the pictures can last a life time.

2.) How do I know about the DSC-P72?

At first I did some research online try to find the perfect camera for me because I know nothing about digital camera. Looking in to the price, performance, quality, and brand I finally found the one for me: Sony CyberShot DSC-P72.

3.) Sony CyberShot DSC-P71/DSC-P72

A lot of people wonder what's the different between the DSC-P71 and DSC-P72. Basically, the P72 is a newer model of the P71. The P72 fixed some of the problems in the P71 and overall improved the performance. So, if you're thinking of buying the DSC-P71, you might want to check out the P72.

4.) The image quality

The Sony DSC-P72 has a resolution of 3.2 Mega pixels, which is more than enough for casual use. 

The P72 has 5 modes to choose from when taking pictures, the bigger the number mean the bigger the picture and higher quality. You can switch the mode anytime.

3.1M XL 
2.8M L
2.0M M
1.2M S
VGA 640x480

I use VGA and 2.0M most of the time, because I like to post my pictures on the internet. 3.1M is the best quality and the biggest size of them all, but the size of the file is too big, so it's not a good choice to use 3.1M if you want to upload the images to the net. Just take pictures in all the modes and find the perfect one for your needs.

5.) The movie mode

The DSC-P72 allows you to record short video with sound. The length of the movie depends on the size of your memory stick. The memory stick included with this camera is 16MB which can record movie up the 20 seconds with sound. 

I like this movie mode a lot, its fun to capture video sometime. And the video and sound quality is very good. 

6.) The LCD screen.

The size of the LCD screen is 1.5 inch same as most of the digital camera in the market right now. The screen is very clear. You can even change the brightness and contrast.

After you took pictures or recorded a video you can go to the playback mode and view your pictures/video. You can put them in different folders, delete them and do whatever you want with them.

7.) Ease of use

You can operate this camera with one finger, everything can be set to automatic, and the camera will do the rest of the work for you. If you want more control, just press one button and set it to the way you like it. I use automatic on my entire picture collection, the quality, lighting and everything else is great.

8.) Upload images to your PC

WOW!

Super fast and easy, all you have to do is plug in the USB cable to your PC and The camera, and everything will be done automatically.

9.) Bottom line

The only problem I found is the battery life, but since Sony gave us a rechargeable battery and a charger, that's not a big problem.

If you're looking for a digital camera with great image quality and easy to use. The DSC-P72 is the one for you. You can not go wrong with this camera, it's just that good.

The package included:

1 DSC-P72 camera
2 rechargeable batteries
1 charger
1 16MB memory stick
1 CD



Thanks for reading my review. I hope this is helpful to some of you.
