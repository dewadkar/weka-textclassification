            I bought my MVC-FD81 about a year ago and I find it to be a very fun and easy camera to use.  One of the main features that enticed me to buy this particular camera was the ability to use regular 3 1/2 inch diskettes to save the pictures.  With the price of diskettes becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper, it's a very cheap source of &quot;digital film&quot;.  I brought this camera with me last year when I went on a 1 week trip to the East coast and armed myself with 50 diskettes figuring I could always buy more if I ran out.  If I had bought a camera with a memory card I was afraid that I if I did run out of space for pictures I would be pretty much done for the trip as far as taking anymore pictures since I would not have any computer to store the pictures on.  Some of the other features I particularly enjoy are the ability to record MPEGs and the sepia and B&amp;W settings for taking pictures.

As far as drawbacks, I would say the main one is the fact that it is a little bulky to carry around.  I wish this model had a regular camera-style viewer in addition to the LCD panel on the back.  On bright sunny days it is sometimes difficult to see the LCD panel but I usually get by by just making sure the LCD backlight is turned off.

I use a Case Logic portable CD player case to carry my camera around and it works pretty well having some extra room to carry several diskettes and an extra battery.

Overall, I find this camera to be a good choice especially for those who are interested in taking pictures to put up on web sites.  If you are interested in taking digital pictures for printing, you might be better off with one of the megapixel cameras (maybe perhaps the newer FD-83 model).
