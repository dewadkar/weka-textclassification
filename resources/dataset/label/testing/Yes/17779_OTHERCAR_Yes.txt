            I selected this vehicle because 4 months after I bought my 1999 SL2 I had an accident where someone ran me off the road and I lost control, the car flipped and rolled. The safety features of this car is what saved my mother, who was 82, and myself. One of the emergency team members said, &quot;I am a believer in Saturn now.&quot;  I bought the 2000 SL2 and I love the new styling, power windows and locks, security system, trac, AntiLock Brakes and the CD Player.  It handles wonderfully and I have carpal tunnel syndrome so this is important to me.  I think anyone who is looking for a safe car that handles well, looks great and gets great mileage should consider this car.  Even my Siberian Huskies love it and they look great in their canine safety belts!  <br><br>
