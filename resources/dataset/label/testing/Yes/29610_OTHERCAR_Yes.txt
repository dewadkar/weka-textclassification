            I've had my 2003 1500 SLT 2dr w/ the 5.7 Hemi and 5 spd auto since June. I've put just over 7000 miles on the odometer and I still have yet to be impressed by this truck.
The optional 20" wheels give it a ride better suited for a chuck wagon, but the appearance points for having "dubs" almost out weigh this. To make up for the poor ride quality the SLT package includes power drivers seat w/ inflatable lumbar. This is something I thought was over kill for a list of options on a truck but now I wouldn't have it any other way. The interior is spacious to say the least. I am 6'1 and its next to impossible for me to reach across the cab and open the door or reach something thats fallen off the seat in the passenger side.
This extra cabin space means that myself and 2 full sized humans can ride farther than the grocery store w/o getting cramped. Not to mention nearly a full foot of space behind the seat to store anything in the included bin.
The truck very responsive when cornering at speed but making a right on red in the rain is tough because of the posi-trac rear end(it wants to grip in a straight line so it tends to make the truck slide). The brakes are wonderful. Dual piston front disc and rear discs are very welcome after the last generations of trucks having small front discs and quick to fade drums out back.
My issue is w/ the engine. Dodge never came out and said it but this was advertised as a sport truck. They showed the truck in mock street racing scenes, etcs. From a dead stop this truck can't get out of its own way. 40-60mph for passing is awesome to say the least, anything outside of that range and its very sluggish for an advertised 345hp/380tq. On top of the subpar acceleration the fuel economy is non-existant. City driving I get 11.8mpg(better than most I've talked to w/ the same truck) and 16mpg highway. I bought this truck to escape the high insurance on my sports car but the cost is brought back up at the gas pump.
If you are into aftermarket mods, there is little available for the new ram in the way of performance. There are several lowering/lifting kits out, as well as a few other appearance mods.
