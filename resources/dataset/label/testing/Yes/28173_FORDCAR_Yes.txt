            My family purchased our '95 Ford Taurus in 1997 and it has been a solid family car in every way.  From long trips to short jaunts back and forth to work every day, the car has performed wonderfully.  The ride is smooth but the suspension is firm enough to keep the car from bottoming out.  I don't think it's done so since we've owned the car.  The 3.0 V6 (the middle of the three engines available) supplies an adequate amount of power to the car, and the automatic transmission, while shifting slowly under a load, will allow the car to get nearly 34 miles per gallon on the freeway.  It gets about 24 miles to the gallon around town.

It has a surprisingly smooth and quiet ride for it's price range.  Although ours had 55,000 miles on it three years ago when we bought it, a new set of brakes is the only real work we've had done to the car other than regular maintenance.

The cloth seats are comfortable, and the back seat is suprisingly wide and has plenty of leg room even for an adult.  In fact the whole car is comfortably roomy.  Some stereo controls (seek, memory, and volume) have conveniently been located on the upper part of the dash for easy reaching, allowing the driver not to have to take their eyes off the road when they want to change the radio station.  The rest of the controls are on the stereo which is relatively low on the dash.  

The closest things I have to real complaints with the car are that the aerodinamics of the front end allow a LOT of bugs to catch on the front grill and headlights.  On a white car like ours, these are an eyesore and are nearly impossible to get off after a while.  Also, the design of the doors and floorboards makes a step of about six inches in the front and a narrower doorway in the back due to the rear wheels, possibly making it harder for elderly people to get in and out of the car.  On ours, we also have a re-occuring problem of a blinker that blows every six months or so.  It's not a major problem, it's just annoying to have to put a new bulb in twice a year.  I have noticed that many of this body style of Taurus' steering pulls to one side or another.  While ours doesn't do this, a few of the Taurus' we test drove did, as does my grandmother's '87 Taurus.

I have heard that Taurus' equipped with the four cylinder engine run really weak, even without the air conditioning on.  Keep in mind though that the 3.8 V6 is the same engine Ford installs in its base model Mustangs.

On the whole, this car is dependable and as solid a family car as I have seen.<br><br>
