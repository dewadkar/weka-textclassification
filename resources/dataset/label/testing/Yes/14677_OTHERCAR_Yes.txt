            I am absolutely thrilled with my 1999 Subaru Forester L.  I briefly considered both the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4, but found the Forester superior.  It's bigger than both the Honda and Toyota, but the test drive made all the difference.  The Forester has superb handling - better than my Saturn sedan.  We needed a new car and I was tired of wedging all our stuff into a sedan and tired of being stranded at Home Depot with a critical item that would just not fit in the Saturn.  It easily fits a family of four and all its junk, although we do use a roof-top carrier for extended trips.  What's so great about the Forester is that it doesn't drive like a truck; it drives like a car but has the space or a  truck and the four-wheel drive is fantastic!
My only complaints are minor:  the cup holders are flimsy and in inconvenient locations like right in front of the heater/air-conditioner and blocking the ventilation controls.  I didn't buy remote keyless entry and am kicking myself for that, but I think I can get it retrofitted for not much $.  The light-colored upholstery worried me for a time, but I read another review that said it was easy to clean.  I also like the mat in the cargo area - you can just take it out and hose it down - but things do slide.
If you have a large family and like to carry stuff, go with a mini-van, but if you want the space of an SUV without the truck-feel, go with the Forester.<br><br>
