            I purchased a 2002 Ford Ranger a little over a year ago, and so far I have been extremely pleased with it.  I was looking for something that would reasonably be able to haul occasional loads yet still function as a daily vehicle, and the Ranger has been exactly that.  I was able to get it off the lot for $11,000, I purchased the 4-cylinder with manual transmission.  I have since driven an automatic 6-cylinder ranger, and I actually felt that the driving was a bit more responsive with the manual transmission; the lack of brute engine strength was a bit more noticeable in the automatic.  I've used it to tow trailers and move to a new house, and I've also used it to drive to work every day that I've owned it, and it handles both jobs well.  The gas mileage is fair, I usually get around 25 mpg, but on longer drives approaches 30 mpg.  The handling is actually very nice, it drives like a car.  The ride is bumpy, though, and I find myself trying to avoid even the smallest bump in the road.  Every pothole jostles the entire pick-up mercilessly.  At any speed above a crawl speedbumps cause major shudders.  The only other setback I have found is that at 6' tall, I have the seat as far back as it will go in order to drive comfortably, so unless you're short you probably won't be able to fit much behind the seat.  Despite the few drawbacks, the car drives comfortably enough for a long drive or a short commute, although you're not going to be able to take many people with you.  The pick-up came with AC, but not much else, the AM/FM radio just begs to be replaced.  Again, I was able to get out of the dealership for $11,000 total price, which is a hard price to beat.
