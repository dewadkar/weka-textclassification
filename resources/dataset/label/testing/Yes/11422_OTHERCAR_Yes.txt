            I purchased my 4Runner in May,2000, after owning several 4Runners in the past. I traded in a Subaru Forester, which was a nice enough vehicle, but it definitely wasn't a 4Runner.

I went back to the Toyota because the comfort, ride, and quality of the Toyota is, in my opinion, unmatched by other similar vehicles. I am 6' 3&quot; and 235 lbs, and find it much easier to get in and out of this vehicle, which sits much higher than the Subaru Forester did.  I now have about 11,500 miles on it and have been averaging around 20-22 MPG in combined city/country driving. Driving in the winter, using 4 wheel drive, will lower the gas mileage, depending on how long you are in 4WD. I purchased the 5-speed manual transmission, which I prefer. This option will no longer be offered after the 2000 model year.

I also chose the &quot;highlander&quot; option which offers the hood scoop, alloy wheels, and larger tires. I wanted that option for personal preference, but it is nice to see the attention it gets from other drivers when I drive down the road. 

As has been widely reported, SUV's have a high center of gravity, due to their high profile, and require a different driving style than a car. I have had the opportunity to drive several other SUV's long distances, and in my opinion, the 4Runner seems to have more cornering stability than the others. The ride is &quot;solid&quot; which contributes to the handling. It doesn't ride like a luxury car, but it is comfortable, quiet(I have to look at the tachometer at a stoplight to see if the engine is running), and well appointed.

If you are considering the purchase of a SUV, check the resale of the model(s) you are interested in. Look at them all after 50,000 miles and 3 years old and compare their value then. You will find that the 4Runner holds its value very well, compared to most of the others. This is my 5th 4Runner. The first one I bought was in 1984. I put 180,000 miles on it and was sorry I let a co-worker talk me into selling it to him. I am sold on Toyotas, and would recommend one to anyone. As the old slogan goes, &quot;Get your hands on a Toyota, you'll never let go.&quot;     <br><br>
