            Needing a new car for winter, I wanted a small SUV.  However with credit problems, the only car we could get was the Honda Civic VP.  I wasn't happy to be in a small car, but my opinion has changed.  We've had it for a month and my husband never gets a chance to drive it, because I always have it!

   The car hadles good, but there is quite a bit of road noise.  Gas milege is great!  I'm small and need the seat all the way up to comfortably reach the pedals, but my kness hit the steering colum when I get in and out.

  This is a great car for new families.  The car-seat tethers were a needed safety feature, though I wish the passenger side airbag could be turned on and off.<br><br>
