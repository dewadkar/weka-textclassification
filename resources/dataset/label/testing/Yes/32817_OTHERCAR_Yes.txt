            This is the best car I ever owned.  It is a nice looking car; and it fun to drive.  It is a roomy car and has four door thus eliminating the nasty chore of climbing into the back seat.  It gets over 30 miles per gallon; which is much improvement over any of my previous vehicles.  It is very dependable and does not break down; besides doing the regular maintainence which needs to be done on any car; this is truly effortless driving.  Also the trunk is HUGE; it is amazing how much stuff I have stuffed in there!
The only thing wrong with this car is the location of the seat belts; they are located right along the door frames and hooked to door on the end.  This causes two problems: 1.  If you are sitting in the parked car [like waiting for someone] and someone comes up to the car and opens the door while you have your seat belt on it will choke you.  2. Because the seat belts are located right along the door frame you must realign the belts and buckles each and every time by hand or they will get caught in the door.  
The other problem I had was with the turn signal; because they have the turn signal and cruise control controls and the clicker for the high beams, all in the turn signal control.  10 days after I bought this car while clicking to my high beams the handle broke off in my hand about an inch from the steering column.  They easily fixed it in a couple of minutes by snapping a new one in.
This is a good car.<br><br>
