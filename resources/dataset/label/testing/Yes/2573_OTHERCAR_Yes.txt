            I bought my Prelude, named Helen, from a woman named Helen. She liked it enough to name it after herself, and I completly agree. Much more reliable, it turns out, than her namesake, this car will please.

With 168,000 miles, my Prelude has been stolen once, broken into twice, crashed twice, and been driven almost exclusively in the battleground that are the LA freeways, and she is still a great ride.

With a 2.2 liter engine developing approx. 140 horsepower, this car is a great performer. Quite and smooth, it inspires confidence on the most tricky roads, and its incredible responsivness makes it an ideal ride for a crazy commute. If you crave for more power, open up her breathing with an an easy to find aftermarket intake or exhaust. The 100$ I spent on the intake for Helen gave her a nice throaty roar which is loud at high revs but does not intrude during normal driving. The 5 speed transmission is crisp, and of course the exterior styling is outstanding.

Flaws are the soil of personality, and the '92 Prelude has a few, but the engine and drivetrain has remained trouble free. The back seat won't fit anyone but a small child, since there is not place to put your feet under the front seats which are directly mounted onto the floor. The dashboard's outer space styling is cool at first, but gets old, and the top of it completly unusable as storage. The glove compartment is too small even for gloves, but it has a nice big center lockbox. And don't have any 8 mph run-ins with curbs, as the airbag is painfully overreactive and expensive to replace.

This car is trouble free, quick, beautiful, unique and much reliable than its non Honda competitors. If you are lucky enough to find one, snatch it up, go on a roadtrip, leave some Eclipses in your dust, and enjoy this great peace of machinery.
