WHY I BOUGHT IT!
I of course, if you have read any of my epinions, was looking for something inexpensive.  I will sum up why I bought this camera:
(1) Price - $245
(2) 2X Zoom
(3) 1280X960 resolution (check the pricing on other cameras for this res. And you would be hard pressed to find anything else cheaper.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE CAMERA:
(1) The three things listed just above
(2) The size of the camera is really small and compact and light weight
(3) The many different picture quality modes:Fine, Normal, and Basic all at either the 1280X960 or 640X480
(4) Storage capacity (4mb SmartMedia card)- 6-96 pictures depending on quality of picture
(5) 10 second timer
(6) Comes with Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition version 3.0 for photo editing and many other things you would like to do with your pictures.
(7) Easy to use wheel controller.  Just thumb the dial to the setting you want.

WHAT I DISLIKED ABOUT THE CAMERA:
(1) The upload time to dump your pictures from your camera to your computer takes some time.  I usually leave the room for awhile if I have the camera full of pictures
(2) I have gotten a few pictures with light spotting if the room is really dark when taking pictures.

OVERALL RATING:
I give it two thumbs up.  I love this camera and would definitely recommend it to everyone.  I really do not believe you can find a camera with this quality at such an unbelievable price<br><br>
