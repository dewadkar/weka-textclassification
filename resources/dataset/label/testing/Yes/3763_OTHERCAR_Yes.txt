            I wanted a Suburban but my husband felt we really needed a truck so I gave in. I love it. We bought the extended cab and I really feel like I am driving my Suburban. I love my smooth ride and how I feel safe being in the size of it. We bought the bigger engine and I really have the power and I get great gas mileage. We got the 3 door which is nice but our next truck will be a 4 wheel drive and a regular 4 door. I like to feel safe in the snow and I am not real crazy about the way the third door opens. Getting groceries in the truck if a car is beside me is a real headache. We are GM people and we will be driving a truck for years I am sure.<br><br>
