            While the <b>M Roadster</b> isn't sitting in my garage, I've collected enough on-road experience with this car to present a fuller driving impression than a dealer's test drive will allow.  It's to prospective buyers I write this review.

<b>First impressions</b>
The M Roadster, as well as the whole Z3 line, presents an stunning visual impression for both the driver and passerby.    Behind the wheel, the hood of the car looms ahead, missile-like, where I felt like the pilot of some road-going weapon, ready for launch.  This initial sense is conveyed on all the Z3 models, but the difference was revealed when I turned the ignition key.  At the turn of the key, the soul of the M Roadster rumbles to life with 240 horsepower, the same robust engine found on the M3.  At once, I  realized this was a different machine altogether from the other Z3 models.

<b>Hitting the streets</b>
At slow speeds, the M Roadster is refined, tractable, and easy to maneuver.  The engine does not jump ahead in first gear, and I was quite surprised by its low-speed agility. It required only a gentle hand to navigate the parking lot.  

On to the highway!  As I entered the highway, the road was clear for a good mile.  There I decided to see where this car would take me.  So I punched it.  I was <b>not</b> adequately prepared for the next sensation. The engine quickly responded to my cue, propelling me towards the horizon at an ungodly speed.  The car truly felt like a missile, able to leap to the horizon at a moment's notice.   Despite the exhilaration, the cold sweat on my brow, and the speed-induced smile on my face, I was able to keep this little monster under control.  Road tests report this car reaches 60 from a standstill in a mere 5 seconds.  Is that what I did?  Yes, and perhaps <i>some,</i> for by the time my foot reached for the brake, my motored friend and I were exceeding the posted limit by a good clip.  Sorry officer--it was an experiment!


<b>Taking the turns</b>
What the M Roadster can do with a straight road, it matches nicely in the corners.  I live near mountain roads, so I put the car through the paces on a twisty stretch.  There, the M Roadster felt sure-footed and responsive.  Maintaining clean, tight turns at speed was easy, while lacking the unpredictable twitch found in many small, overpowered rides.  I should add that I'm a veteran to these roads, and naturally avoid speeds or road conditions that would put me or others in peril.  The car responded to my sense of adventure quite eagerly, while providing a good margin of safety.  The only downside to the short, responsive wheelbase is that the car can sometimes feel &quot;loose&quot; in the daily commute.  But I suspect this sensation fades with time.

<b>It goes. It stops.</b>
The engine's power is nicely matched by the firm, 4-wheel discs, assisted by ABS.  It's quite reassuring to know that a little over-exuberance can be quickly checked by a tap to the brakes.  I was <b>quite impressed</b> by the sure, linear response of the brakes. In a test at 60 mph, I found a quick stomp to zero did not produce any lack of traction or control. 


<b>Interior features</b>
Performance aside, a few interior features scored high on my list.  The seats are comfortable, stylish, and hold firmly in tight turns.  These heated seats are wonderful, enabling me to keep the top down as night sets in.  The chrome-lined instrumentation reminds me of the stark, readable gauges in early sports cars--simple, direct, and to the point.  I also like the single control that regulates the heating/cooling levels. I was a little surprised by the lack of trunk space, but what should I expect for a two-seater?  Even so, I think it would be hard for two people to pack for more than a weekend getaway.

<b>Can I gripe a little?</b>
While much of the car is fantastic, there are a few aspects that need improving.  Most glaringly, the external styling of the M Roadster is too similar to the other models, and does not match the added performance characteristics, and price of this car.  It should be more distinctive, such as the Z8.  In addition, the fit and finish leaves something to be desired for a 40K+ car.  There are many cosmetic parts attached to this car with mere <b>double sided tape!</b> And, to nobody's surprise, they detach over time--which is, quite frankly, inexcusable.  

Minor flaws aside, the M Roadster is a true sports car: powerful and sure-footed while easy to drive.  <br><br>
