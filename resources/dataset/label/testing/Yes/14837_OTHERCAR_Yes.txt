            Hi!~~

My 2 yr. lease on my '98 Bravada (Demo w/6K on the odometer) was up, and I got a letter from the dealership a couple of months early, letting me out of my current lease if I was interested in a new one..... To clarify the following....I leased this in June of '98, (99's were already available for order)) so I thought I'd pick up another demo....2K..  

Bottom line, I picked up a BRAND NEW 2K Platinum Edition , ALL TRICKED OUT, at the same lease terms I had on the '98 I had leased before.... (FANTASTIC DEALER...TORCO, in Elgin, IL.)

TECH:  6 disc changer didn't work when I drove it off the lot (didn't have any discs to try out till I got home..) Went back to the dealer at 4:40 P.M. on Fri. (same day, 1 hr. later) before Labor Day, and the Service Manager had a Tech pull my Disc Changer out and switch it with another, which entailed keeping a Tech on the job on over-time until 6:00 P.M..... FANTASTIC SERVICE AND FOLLOW-UP VIA MAIL!!!!!!!

Obviously under-powered, but adequate....Luxurious cabin....Love all the bells and whistles ( see my previous memo in re: Caddy SLS)...Butt warmer on both sides is fantastic for No. Il. winters......

Only beefs.....Wind noise is worse than it was in my '98, but road handling is outstanding....

I do a part-time gig shuttling cars for a service company, and I've driven all types of SUV'S...Mercury, Lexus, Ford, Jeep, Mercedes..All top of the line cars owned by execs...I can honestly say that not one of them has the &quot;road feel&quot;, or that intangible &quot;solid feeling&quot; that this SUV has...

Summing up...My buddy's girlfriend just bought a new 2K Jeep Grand Cherokee, all tricked out, and after he drove my Bravada, he couldn't believe how much better mine &quot;felt&quot; than hers~~~~~

Best of luck to you all, and I hope that your dealer is half as good as mine...I feel like I bought a &quot;Roll's&quot; rather than an &quot;Olds&quot;!!!``
