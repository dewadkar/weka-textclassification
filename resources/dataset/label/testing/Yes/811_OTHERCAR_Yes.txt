            in the 2 years ive had my highland 4 door sedan ive been impressed more times than with any other car ive owned or driven.With its 4 cilinder 2.2 liter engine it gives it just enough power to keep up on the highway but not enough power to want to speed. Although notorios for blowing head gaskets i have not had a problem with it yet. its all metal no fiberglass body can withstand high impact collisions trust me ive been in a few. the frame is triple impact welded so it can withstand everyday fenderbenders and more!!this is a great car for someone who travels alot its great on gas 26 miles per gallon in town and 33 miles per gallon highway travel.
at a reasonable cost this is an ideal car for someone just starting out driving or someone who doesnt need a race car
