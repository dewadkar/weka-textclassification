              I do insurance inspections and needed a great digital camera at a great price. I couldn't believe it when I ran into the Polaroid PDC640 at such an affordable price. It's such an easy camera to use. You can take anywhere from 45 to 330 pictures with the memory card that comes with it. It doesn't take any special or expensive batteries it only takes 4AA batteries. The number of pictures you can take depends on which setting (1-4) you choose. I love the fact that I can also review my pictures on the screen immediately after taking them to see if they took o.k. or if I need to retake them. The software is easy to use and lets you download all or some of your pictures into a folder. You can then print every picture by choosing "print folder". If you have a good printer, set it on the right settings and paper quality, you can get quality pictures from this camera!
  The only disadvantages that I have found with it is that the display screen is hard to see when trying to take a picture in bright light. After you take the pictures you can still review them on the display screen, you just can't see the image on the screen while taking the picture. The other disadvantage is that there is no zoom features. It would be an even better camera if it had zoom. I recently spoke to Polaroid about what cameras they offer with a zoom. They said they allow you to upgrade to a newer or better camera by allowing you a trade in on your older model. If I decide to upgrade I'll let you know what I think of the new one.
