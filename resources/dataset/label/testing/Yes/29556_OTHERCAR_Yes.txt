            Just when they get one right, they quit making it.  So naturally 1996 was the last production year.  So, another good car bites the dust while mediocrity abounds.  I fell in love with the Stealth at first glance.  I usually make the rounds and test drive everything new and yank the salesperson's chain just a little.  Hey, if you're gonna offer me a test drive with no obligation to buy, then don't get mad when I say &quot;Thanks for the test drive, I'll think about it.&quot;  Of course the first time I drove the RT, I couldn't afford it.  Out here in California, the Stealth had a &quot;No Dicker&quot; mark up 0f $10,000, above the fairly substantial MSRP.  Well, here I am in the year 2000 driving an almost ten year old car and I feel like I'm still on the cutting edge.

This is a great car to buy used, or &quot;pre-owned&quot; if you favor shading the truth.  Always, and I mean ALWAYS, check out a car carefully before you buy it.  There are plenty of abused Stealths and 3000GTs (the sister car from Mitsubishi)out there.  I just happened to find one of the many good ones.  Everything is still crisp and new feeling.  All the gadgets work.  There are many trim levels even within the R/T package.  I was lucky enough to find one with automatic everything.  The auto temperature controls are great.  Set the temp you want and forget it. The controls are very intuitive, although I broke down and read the owners manual to figure out what a couple of the buttons were for.  I have found that Japanese gadgets tend to last longer than American gadgets on cars.  Had this been an American built car, I would have been a little leary of all the automation approaching ten years of age.

 The performance is stunning.  The ECS (electronically controlled suspension) actually makes a noticeable difference.  Of course this is one of the first things I had to try out.  The &quot;Tour&quot; mode is plenty good enough for 98% of drivers.  I like to find a back road now and then and really scuff up the tires.  The &quot;Sport&quot; mode flattens out what little body roll there is to next to nill.  Although I prefer a rear wheel drive sports car for performance, careful modulation of the throttle and the right mix of brake will induce a hint of oversteer and make the ride more fun.  I found that approaching the limit of the tire grip, understeer crept up quite predictably.  This is easy to compensate for, but you'll sacrifice speed through the twisties.  Again, very few people drive anywhere near the edge of performance, but since I do when the situation (and lack of law enforcement) allow, I thought I'd throw in the extreme stuff.

The 24 valve V-6 is rev-happy with a really sweet growl as you run it right up to the red-line in each gear.  3rd gear is a great all around gear and pulls like a Clydesdale from 3500 to 7000 RPM.  As difficult as it is to turn down the excellent stereo system, you owe it to yourself to do this at least once and appreciate the quality that lies under the hood.  As a self proclaimed expert on fast autos regardless of price tag, I regard this as a top buy car. I've owned a Mustang, Camaro, and Trans Am, this is by far the best, and the others were no slouches.

Regarding ergonomics, I'll make the assumption (yeah, I know) that if you're looking at a performance vehicle, you already ready know that none of them are a breeze to get in and out of.  Some are downright uncomfortable to drive over an hour or so.  Lowering yourself into the Stealth is pretty easy, getting out may seem a bit cumbersome at first.  Relative to the competition, the comfort of the Stealth is simply outstanding.  A four hour trip to Tahoe was a breeze.  I actually wanted to keep going a while longer.  The lumbar and lateral support adjustments come pretty close to making a custom fit seat.  I didn't like the fact that you need to leave the arm rest up to use the cup holders.  A cheesy clip on holder that you can hide when not in use solves that.  All in all, the Stealth doesn't make you pay (in convenience) the high price that most sports cars demand.  Ask anyone who has driven a 85 through 97 Corvette.

In summary, if you do as every good used-car shopper should do and have the vehicle looked at before you buy it, performance enthusiasts should find this car a tremendous bargain.  You won't feel like you had to settle for something less.  <br><br>
