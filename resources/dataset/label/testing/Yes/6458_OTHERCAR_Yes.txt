            I've driven a Camry for the last four years and I can't complain.  I liked it so much my new car is a Toyota (although not a Camry).  The car is very sporty for what I would consider a small family car.  It had great pick up and was whisper quiet.  The interior was nice and comfortable.  You can sleep in the thing, trust me I know.  The back seats are also nice.  It has just enough room in my opinion.  The trunk is of a nice too.  You can fit a rather large person in the back, and no it was not a dead body it was a friend who went in willingly.  The LE model, which we had, had most of the niceties of luxury cars.  Plus in my dealings with car sales man, Toyota dealers deal very well, so you get the car for a nice price.<br><br>
