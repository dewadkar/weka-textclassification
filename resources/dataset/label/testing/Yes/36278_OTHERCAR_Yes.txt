            When I went to look at my first car, I had many options presented to me.  Two years later, I am convinced that leasing a Corolla CE was definitely the smartest way to go.  For the price, it has been a stellar car.  The car definitely has more zip to it than I would expect from a midsize sedan.  While it is certainly not the fastest out there, when the light turns green, I usually get a good jump on the drivers around me!  It also has one of the smoothest shifters I have driven.

I have not had any problems at all with the car in 2 years.  Routine maintenance has been inexpensive, as has been insurance.  And the factory speakers for the radio are surprisingly good.  Since I drive quite a bit and listen to music, this was a wonderful bonus.  Another nice thing about the car is the number of hidden compartments for storage of cups, trash, change.  The glove compartment is also good-sized.  

Of course, there are a few small things I would change.  There is no inside trunk release, the radio buttons are cheaply made and easily come loose, and it is unusually difficult to adjust the front seats' distance from the dashboard.  But other than these small things, I am completely happy with my car and am considering purchasing the car after my lease is up.<br><br>
