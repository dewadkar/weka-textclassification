            Overview &#150 The Mega-Bust feature made the Panasonic camera&#146s stand out from the pack, and it was the main reason for my choice.  The digital revolution was passing me by, so I finally decided to get on board.   I wanted a small camera that I could keep under my ski coat and hardly know it&#146s there when I was on the slopes.  That eliminated the full feature, bigger cameras with longer zoom lenses.  I was originally attracted to the Olympus models with their big 10X zooms, since a long zoom is nice on the slopes, as the distances from you and your subject can be large.  My desire for small size ruled these out.   I have skied with large cameras under my coat, even an early generation camcorder, and fortunately I&#146ve never fallen while doing this.   (Ouch!)

On brand names, I remembered that my Minolta X-700 SLR film camera had to be sent back to the factory twice for repairs.  My Pentax IQ Zoom 140 point & shoot had to be sent back because the very first roll of film I shot would not rewind back into the cassette.  (I took it to the one-hour photo booth at Walgreen&#146s, and they took the film out without exposing it to light.)  I&#146ve had good luck with Panasonic electrical stuff over the years, and their mega-burst feature seemed cool, so I looked at their cameras.  When skiing, its fun to take pictures of friends jumping off (small) cornices and bumps.  With my Pentax point & shoot film camera, the one second lag time it takes to focus and set the exposure makes it difficult to get the picture you want.  My theory was the Mega-Burst feature of the Panasonic allows 3 to 5 shots in one second, depending upon the image size and quality.  Hopefully, one of these shots would capture the jump at the right moment.   The other hope was that the ability to freeze frame my golf swing would allow me to correct any flaws and hit the ball like Ernie Els. 

Also, the mystic of the Leica lens was another attraction to the Panasonic.  Many of those guys who were published in Life magazine over the years seemed to use Leica cameras, and for life-long shutterbug like me, a Leica lens was a calling I finally had to answer.

Features
The DMC-LC20 is the low-end model of the Panasonic line.  Mine is silver, versus the black one in the Epinions picture.  It has an &#147effective&#148 image size of 2.0 mega-pixels.  Optical zoom is 3 to 1, and digital zoom of 2 to 1.  It has five picture taking modes: Normal, macro, landscape, night portrait, and motion images.  The flash has five modes also: auto, auto/red-eye (it flashes once before the real flash), forced on (for back lighted subjects), slow sync (so darker backgrounds come out lighter), and forced off.

You can compensate the exposure from � f-stops to  2 f-stops.  The white balance has five settings, auto, daylight, cloudy, halogen, and set it yourself by aiming at something white.

Metering mode is center weighted, as is the auto focus.  The ISO setting can be set from auto/100/200/400.  The shutter speed it selects shows up on the LCD screen, and changing to a faster ISO setting will result in a faster shutter speed.   The picture format is jpeg, and movies are quick time jpeg.

It comes with two NiMH batteries, a charger, a UBS cord, a cable for to attach it to your televison video in-jack.  It also came with an 8MB SD memory card, and a rebate offer of two 16MB cards.  I purchased it at Office Max, and they include a 128MB SD card for free with the camera.  That was worth $69 at the time and motivated me to buy it during that pre-Christmas promotion.

As this is my first digital camera, I think the menu and basic operation is similar to other cameras.  The menu is very intuitive, but I found the whole move to digital requires a bigger learning curve than I expected.  This camera has lots of features, and it takes a while to learn all of them.

There is a 1.5 inch LCD viewfinder on the back of the camera, with many (24) indicators on it.  I know what most of these mean by now, but wow, I just wanted to point and shoot.  You can shut these off, and just display the image, or shut the whole LCD screen off to save the batteries.

 Viewfinder
It is range finder style viewfinder which zooms in as needed.  I see clearly through it, despite that there is no diopter adjustment, and I need a  1.75 lens in my reading glasses.   None of the 24 indicators on the LCD screen show up in the viewfinder.   For an old guy who can&#146t read the LCD without his reading glasses, I found this to be a major drawback.  Also, out in the bright Colorado sunshine on the ski slope, the LCD isn&#146t bright enough to read anyway, even if you turn it up all the way.  I don&#146t believe any low-end cameras have display indicators in the viewfinder, so I don&#146t view it as a design flaw, just something you can&#146t expect to get unless you spend more and want to carry around a bigger camera.  I intend for my next camera to have these things visible in the viewfinder.

Lens
Here is the lens description from the website, for you technical guys:
&#147  Leica DC Vario-Elmarit Lens
The top compact lens in the Leica family, the DC Vario-Elmarit lens combines comfortably small size with superb image rendering.
The DC Vario-Elmarit Lens on the DMC-LC20K/DMC-LC20S Features:
�	Seven elements in six groups 
�	Two aspherical lenses 
�	F2.8-F4.5 brightness 
�	Focal distance of 5.4mm to 16.2mm 
�	3x zoom lens system equivalent to a 35mm to 105mm lens 
�	Multi-coating process applying to nine lens surfaces, including the optical filter &#147

I took some pictures of a brick wall at full zoom, and didn&#146t notice any distortion, but it is only a 3X zoom, so I didn&#146t expect any.  Ditto on wide angle.  Nor I have noticed any color distortions from the lens.

Auto focus &#150 You first press the shutter button halfway down, and wait about one second.  The camera focuses on what is in the brackets of the viewfinder, and sets the exposure.  It beeps when it is done, and a dot lights up in the center of the LCD screen.  This takes a bit of learning to do it right.  When you hand the camera to someone else to take your picture, they usually press if the full way down, and the picture is not focused properly.  These pictures still are okay for a snapshot, and the exposure seems better than the focusing.  No manual focus option exists.   I&#146ve used the macro focus a few times, it seems to work well.

Flash &#150 the flash is too small for great indoor shots.  Ten feet is stretching it, but I think this is problem for all small cameras.  My Pentax 160 zoom film camera takes mediocre indoor shots also.  Same reason; the flash simply can&#146t put out much light when it&#146s so small. 

Controls & Design &#150 overall, I give it high praise.  It fits in my shirt pocket, or in my pants pocket provided they are not too tight.   Dimensions are 2.6" x 3.9" x 1.6".  The zoom is convenient and the viewfinder is clear.   I don&#146t like the red and green colors of the status indicators that are next to the viewfinder.  I&#146m one of the 8% of males who are color blind, and most of us mix up red and green.  The top indicator tells you the camera is ready.  The bottom one tells you if the flash is ready.  Basically, when they&#146re not blinking things are okay, when blinking, you don&#146t have enough light or its busy focusing or recharging.

Power &#150 I find the battery life adequate, but you have to watch how much time you spend looking the pictures on the LCD.  I got a second set of batteries, but could probably get along without them.

Price &#150 I paid $249, but that included the 128MB SD memory card that Office Max threw in.  They said it was worth $99, but $69 was really the street price at the time for such a card.

Shutter lag -  It takes about three seconds to power up the camera if the flash isn&#146t needed, and about three more seconds if it needs the flash.  The lag time between pictures is about the same.  

In the field &#150 I took this camera on a couple of ski trips and I was a bit disappointed with some of the results.  Snow pictures are tough to get right with film cameras, and digital proved to be equally as tough.  Some of my friends had Nikon Cool Pix cameras that had a &#147snow beach&#148 setting.  I learned that I had to set the exposure compensation to either  0.75 or  1.0 to get correctly exposed pictures of the snow covered ski slopes, otherwise the pictures were too dark.   I wish I had a &#147snow beach&#148 setting on this camera, but it is the low-end model so you can&#146t expect all the features.  The compensated pictures turned out fine, you just have to remember the to use it.   However, I did eat at the SnowBeach restaurant in the mall at Snowmass Village.  It is just a local diner with very good home style cooking at reasonable prices.   Good clam chowder and beef stew, good everything.  

I kept the camera around my neck, under my ski shell jacket and fleece.  It stayed warm, and I did not keep it out for any longer than I needed to take a few pictures.  The cold weather, 15 degrees or so, it tough on cameras because moisture can condense on them when you put them back under the coat or take them inside.  Also, batteries lose their strength as they get colder, and cameras and other devices like walkie talkies can stop working when they get too cold, for this reason.

The bright colors of our ski jackets came out fine, and all other colors seemed fine (even red and green!)  I have only used the Auto white balance setting.  As for the Mega Burst feature, well, I wasn&#146t successful this winter on stopping the action with it.  As I said earlier, the learning curve on digital photography is longer than I expected.  There is a button to the right of the viewfinder you just press to use this feature.  The problem is that you should disable the flash by moving through the options to the &#147forced off&#148 setting.   If the camera decides to use the flash, you get only one picture, even with the Mega Burst button on.

I was out in the bright Colorado sunshine (I only take a camera with me on sunny days) and I didn&#146t have my reading glasses.   I had earlier taken some portraits of my buddies with the Maroon Bells in the background.  The Maroon Bells are a pair of fourteeners that are in the picture when you select Aspen-Snowmass in the Epinions travel section.  I needed the fill in flash for these shots.  When I later tried to use the Mega Burst feature, I couldn&#146t read the LCD screen due to both the bright sun and my lack of reading glasses, so I was in the wrong flash mode.  I might have been okay in the Auto mode, since it didn&#146t need a flash, but I wanted to be sure, so I thought I moved it to the forced off mode, but I was wrong.  What I did learn was that if you set the flash mode, then turn the camera off, and back on, it stays in the mode you left it in. I could have ducked inside, or in the trees where I might have been able to read the LCD screen, set the flash and be ready for when the kids did those jumps.  Next year I&#146ll have it all figured out!

As for my golf swing, I&#146ve had my son capture my swing several times with the Mega Burst feature.  The club head is blurred, but everything else is sharp.  I tried to do this with a tripod and the self-timer, but that doesn&#146t work.  You can&#146t use these features in combination, even with the flash disabled.   I&#146m sure I&#146ll hit the ball farther and straighter after diagnosing my swing this way.  All the money I&#146ll win this season on those Nassau bets will pay for this camera several times! 
(pre-season high expectations!)


Image Quality &#150 I&#146ve made several 8x10&#146s from the pictures I&#146ve taken.  I&#146ve uploaded them to Ofoto since I don&#146t want to spend the time and money on printing them myself.  The quality is very good, and I take almost all pictures with the picture size they call 1600, which stands for 1600 by 1200 pixels.  We made a 5X7 of a picture taken at the 640, or the smallest size, and it turned out pretty good.   If you look close at this one, you can see some grain to it.   There is a middle size, 1024, which I don&#146t think I&#146ve used.  With the 128MB chip, I&#146ve never run out of space.   The 4x6 snapshots, taken at the 1600 size, are great.


Conclusion &#150 I recommend this camera, as I&#146ve been happy with my experiences so far.  If I decide to upgrade in a few years, I&#146ll give the other Panasonic models a good look.  

I was very frustrated when shopping for a digital camera because the stores do a very poor job of selling these things.  At Best Buy and Office Max, you can&#146t learn anything because none of the cameras have batteries that work or, it they put batteries in one, there was no memory card in it.   So if it powered up, it only said &#147no memory card&#148 and nothing else would work.  I went to a local camera store, expecting a little bit more, and that was all I got, a little bit more.   They had one model that had both batteries and a memory card.  None of the rest did, so I came home and spent time reading Epinions.   I concluded I wanted only an entry-level camera.  I knew enough to know that I didn&#146t know what to look for in a camera, so spending $800 might be a mistake.   I had to get started with an entry-level model, learn about digital photography, and then, maybe later, buy the camera of my dreams.   

The Panasonic web site gives you a lot of information.  After I purchased it, I discovered the Live Manual feature on the web site, which was quite helpful.  Copy and paste the link below into your address window if you wish to go there:

I like using the Arc Soft software, that comes with the camera, to edit photos.  Its seems to do more than I need it to do, and its not too hard to figure out.   The also give you the SD viewer software to down load the pictures from the camera to the pc.  Its okay, but I haven&#146t spent too much time figuring it out.  I&#146ve also used Ofoto&#146s free software called OfotoNow to get the pictures from the camera to the pc.  It is the easiest software to use, but the editing features are quite limited.  Kodak bought Ofoto, so I hope they improve it.  Ofoto is an easy way to share pictures also.   Panasonic included something called Picture Stage to do share and print your photos, but I haven&#146t used it.
