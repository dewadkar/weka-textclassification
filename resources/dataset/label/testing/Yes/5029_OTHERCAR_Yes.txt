            My father bought this car last year as a gift for my mom who just recovered from cancer.  She didn't like it at first because she wanted a convertible.  Since I just graduated from high school, my mom suggested that I should keep it as a graduation gift, but my father thought that that was too big of a gift for a teenager.  I agreed, but I do drive it at least 3 times  week either to pick up my sister from band camp or just taking my mom around shopping.  I like this car because it's accerlator and the brakes are soft to handle.  Also, it is supercharged so it can give super speed when you need it.  I recommend this car because even though my mother has been complaining for a better car for 8 month, she's getting used to it.  You get to really get hooked to this car.  I recommend the color black because that's the color our car is right now.  IT's in great condition and very durable.  IT's a good car for a SUV.  It's also very roomy and comfortable.  The cushions are nice and comfortable.  <br><br>
