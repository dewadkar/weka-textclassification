            The newly redesigned Pontiac FireBird series consists of the V-6 Firebird, the V-8 Formula, and of course the V-8 Trans Am.  The car is available in coupe, t-tops, and convertible.  

FEATURES:
Firebird V-6 - Standard is a 200 horsepower V6 engine, Air conditioning, PASS KEY II theft deterrent system, Delco� AM/FM stereo CD, Cruise control, Power steering, Daytime running lamps, 4-wheel ABS brakes.  The price for this starts at $19,040.

Formula V-8 - Standard is a 305 hp 5.7-liter SFI V8, 6-speed manual transmission, Delco� Monsoon 10-speaker sound system,
Air conditioning, Delco� AM/FM stereo CD, 6-way power driver's seat.  The starting price for the Formula is $24,320.

Trans-Am V-8 - Standard a 305 hp 5.7-liter SFI V8, 6-speed manual transmission, Delco� Monsoon 10-speaker sound system, Air conditioning, Delco� AM/FM stereo CD, Prado leather seating surfaces, T-Tops, Remote keyless entry with theft deterrent, 6-way power driver's seat.  The starting price for the Trans-Am is $27,430.

After owning a Trans-Am, I believe that it is one of the highest performance cars on the road.  Pontiac is to discontinue the Firebird series sometime in the next couple years.  I have heard that it is to be discontinued in 2002, but who knows.  But you should get your hands on this car while you can!<br><br>
