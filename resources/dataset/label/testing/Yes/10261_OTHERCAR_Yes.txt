            Picture it--West Virginia, 1990.  A desperate woman seeks a replacement for her failing 1984 Honda Accord.  After trying the Camry, the new Accord, countless domestic models, and a few minivans--the woman selects a taupe colored Subaru Legacy sedan.  That woman was my mother...and her treatment of the car is testament to the quality of Subaru.

Mom paid just over $12,000 for the car at the end of the model year, and drove it for almost four years.  Back then, as the new models are now, the car had catchy, if conservative styling, a full host of standard features (do its competitors even NOW offer the all-wheel drive that pulled us through many a mountain snowstorm?), and a price that positioned it to compete with other cars in its class.

The best thing I can say about the car is that there simply was no stopping it! Mom &quot;forgets&quot; about maintainance...in the almost ninety thousand miles she put on it, I can guarantee that the oil wasnt changed more than four times.  And the only problem she ever had out of it was a slip in the transmission, which was repaired under recall.

On the downside, Subarus seem to rust like crazy!  I see five and six year old Subarus all the time with pock marks all along the fenderwells.<br><br>
