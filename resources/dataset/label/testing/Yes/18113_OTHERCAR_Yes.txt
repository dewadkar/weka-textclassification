            Hey Reviewers Hows It Goin? I Just recently purchased a 1997 Mercury Mystique GS in White with 82,000 on the dash used from a dealer. The Millage is sort of up there for a 97, but believe me she runs like if she was brand new brought fesh from the showroom floor. This car is my first car,i've had it for about 2 months now and i love it, everyday when i go to start it an go out to work, or etc she always tend to remind me why i purchased her in first place. Now me personally im not a really big Ford Fan i prefer Chevy, but after taking the Mystique for a test drive and checking out all the features, and considering the overall condition i would've been a fool not to buy it. I Bought it for 4,800.00 and after bringing it home i do not regret my purchase. If somehing ever did happen to it i would indeed buy another one. It rides an handles like a dream, the smoothness for a this 2.0 4 cyl Zetec Motor is unreal, maybe because of the good decison making Ford did when this vehicle was made, or because of the fact i just had MICHELIN TIRES put on along with new struts. The car did not need new tires or new struts because it rode like a dream without them, but i had the money so i went ahead an got them put on. Despite it being a 4 cyl the power is pretty impressive i must say, and the throttle response does meet expectations. As with all 4 cylinder vehicles hill-climbing is a pusher, but it handles it like a champ. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone except for those people who demand Power when the gas is tapped. It Will Perform good but if your looking for a car with Mystique characteristics but more power, i would suggest taking a look at the Mercury Sable with a 3.0 or 3.8 liter (preferably 3.8 liter)However, overall this car has alot to offer for the price you may pay for one, and the Style,Quality, and features you really cannot go wrong. I said it before an i'll say it again IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A VEHICLE PLEASE CONSIDER THE MERCURY MYSTIQUE with either motor 2.0 Zetec Inline 4 cylinder (130 hp) or the 2.5 Duratec v-6 (170 hp)you really cannot go wrong either way.
