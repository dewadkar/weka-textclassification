            I went truck shopping for a full-size crewcab to fit a family of 5 including a teenage son getting to be as tall as his old man. Upgrading from a 1977 F-250 Supercab, ANYTHING I picked would be hailed by the wife and kids as the GREATEST truck ever. I narrowed my selections to the Dodge Ram QuadCab, Ford SuperCrew and Chevy HD.

I've always been impressed with the Ram's styling since the new look emerged, but felt the QuadCab was lacking in backseat legroom for adults on a long trip. The Ford SuperCrew was roomy with a soft ride, but didn't leave me with the impression of durability and longevity I was seeking.

Upon driving the Chevy the first time I knew this was THE truck. It had a high, rugged stance and ground clearance that said this truck was ready to WORK!
Opting for a base model (which by the way is not available in the 1500HD) I was expecting cheesy details, but was pleasantly surprised at how well this truck presented. The vinyl seating has a leather quality that has fooled everyone who has ridden in it. Spills and mud are cleaned from the rubberized floor covering in a jiffy. The ride is quiet despite the lack of carpet and cloth.

Cruise control works like a charm. Power lock delay has proven a useful feature. The tie-down points welded in the bed are helpful in tying loads down, and the cargo-light is bright enough to extend beyond the bed of the truck. Oil changes have been easy with the GM oil-life computer and well engineered oilpan and filter placement.

I have to say, though the tires look 2 sizes too small for the truck. The ride height on the 2500HD just puts too much space in the wheelwell for the stock tires. (It's a small nag.)

The engine is quiet and with PLENTY of power. There's a BIGGER engine offered? I guess if you're pulling a hotel behind you, maybe.

The dual-climate controls have already helped my marriage. My  spouse and I can never agree on the same temperature and GM really hit the nail on this one. Besides, the cab is large enough for a separate Zipcode, why not 2 climate zones?
