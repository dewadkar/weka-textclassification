            The HP C200 is the best digital camera I have ever owned. Although it is only 1 Megapixel, it is a GREAT Camera. I bought the C200 because of the price and the trusted HP brand; once again, HP has not left me disappointed! 
I have always been a little &quot;technically impaired&quot;, but this camera has such an easy interface that any person can use it. Installation, use of the camera itself, and uploading the pictures are all a breeze. The memory card can be taken out with a snap or two, and a new one can be placed in effortlessly. 
The best features of the HP C200 are the rugged and durable design, the snap-closed attached lens cover, and the ease of use. If I had to find one thing wrong with this product, I would be hard-pressed. 
The only problem I've ever had involves the cord which runs from the computer to the Camera... removal of the cord from the camera can be somewhat tricky at times, but nothing that someone can't handle. Anyone who wants to join the digital camera age, but is afraid to be left behind should look into this user-friendly camera. I love mine!
