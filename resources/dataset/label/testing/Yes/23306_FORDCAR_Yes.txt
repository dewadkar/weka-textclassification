            I bought my car from a used car lot in April, 1999. I had several reasons to pick this car above others. Firstly, it was the cheapest on the lot. Secondly, the body was in great condition (and still is). Thirdly, the car had low mileage on it from the previous owner. Barring the minor problems that come with a car, I am happy to report that most major repairs I have had done were covered by the three-year warranty. 

My light Tori is a strange little car. It performs better when not warmed up, even in the cold weather. The air conditioner and heater are both equally strong. I own a GL, but it has all the luxuries of the LS model. Any car with power everything, especially an old on in great condition, is well worth the investment. I thoroughly enjoy my car. She has not let me down yet, and I plan on taking such good care of her so that she doesn't let me down. The only thing that has happened that was against my control is a car accident, but when you're not at fault, you're not to blame. <br><br>
