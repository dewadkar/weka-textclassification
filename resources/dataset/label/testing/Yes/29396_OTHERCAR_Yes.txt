            This car has it all. I wanted a luxury car, but not a mercedes (too cocky) and not a BMW (too pricey) The infinity fit my budget, 46 grand for a high powered luxury machiene is amazing. The interior is spacious, roomy, comfertable and the seats feel like pillows. The sound system is amazing, when i want to blast the John Coltrane, I just pop it into the cd player and giant steps is on my way. The ride is very smooth, comfertable, and DEAD quiet. It doesn't guzzle gas, and has an amazing engine. Compared to other luxury imports, in my mind this car is amazing becuase it's unique and not too many other people like it. I definitley trust Inifinity, and it looks like it cost a million bucks, when I got it for 46 g's!<br><br>
