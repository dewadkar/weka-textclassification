            It is a great family van and we have plans to purchase another one, a brand new 2000 model without even looking at the others!  
After searching for and testing numerous mini vans, the GMC Safari is definitely tops!  A lot of time and effort went into our search for a mini van that not only could hold our large family, but also one that would be reliable and quite frankly nice looking.
Our search initially began for a full size van. After several days of looking at and test driving many of them, we came to the realization that a full size van just was not &quot;our cup of tea&quot;.  We also knew, however, that a mini van was just not an eye pleaser. Then we discovered the Safari.  It had the looks of a full size van and all the comforts of a mini van.  We still had to, though, put it through our tests.  We test drove it, played with all of the knobs and buttons and moved around the different seating areas.  It was then that we decided that this was the van for us!
It got good gas mileage (for a van), it seated our entire family comfortably and it had most of the features we were looking for, such as independently controlled front and rear air conditioning.  Access in and out of the van is very simple and roomy.  The front panel displays are easy to read and understand.  The van handles just like a large car.  The engine, we were informed, was a very dependable machine and we have found that to be true.  It is a 1991 with 90,000 miles, so of course we've had our typical routine repairs.  Our model does have all wheel drive, but for the most part is not necessary.  It has great handling abilities and power when we need it.  The &quot;pick up&quot; is not all that great (like we're gonna race it or something), but the power the vehicle has more than makes up for that.
This mini van is tops.
