            In mid-'92, my now ex-wife chose this over the Civic Hatchback or Geo Storm. The Geos are now mostly off the road, having turned into beaters in record time. The Civics are still out there, and at 80,000 miles or so (estimated, as the speedo cable was broken for about a year), so is the MX-3. I kept it when we split. Its appearance remains current and attractive in a world where boring and overly-gimmicky designs date rather quickly.

Although I've heard complaints of sluggishness from automatic and/or steel wheels owners, the 5-speed with attractive alloy wheels has always held its own in traffic (although I do hit the A/C cutout switch when brisk acceleration is needed). Gas mileage is a steady 28-35, depending on conditions. The SOHC 1.6 liter L-4 has been a sweetheart. The most work it has ever required was oil seal replacement due to my misguided attempt to extend the oil-change interval by use of synthetic oil. I surmise that the stuff either ate the seals, or their metallic components were designed to corrode first if the oil lost protective capability--saving bigger bills from harm to more crucial parts. Occasionally a hydraulic lifter will be heard sticking--changing the oil makes it go away, but if it doesn't, changing to an SC (high detergent gas-or-diesel) grade oil gets it on the next oil change. The electronic fuel injection has never required attention except to replace the fuel filter occasionally. I haven't looked in my records to confirm, but I don't remember ever having to change the plugs.

The factory single-DIN (there is a second DIN bay that serves as a junk pocket, or spot for the optional CD-player) AM/FM Mazda-branded cassette stereo with auto-reverse has always been a nice feature. It can be programmed to suicide if a code is not entered after power to it is interrupted. I've never done that, relying instead on the "anti-theft" window stickers with the international "no" symbol over a facsimile of a radio front. On one occasion, someone did try to steal the car. Although the door lock was no sweat (BTW, attempts to open the car on freezing days in Denver damaged the little sprung door that protects the keyhole, but I've never done anything about it), they ran up against an ignition switch that was incredibly well-armored ... I had no idea. So well-armored it took the *LOCKSMITH* all day to replace the damaged one. Who needs an alarm? By comparison, my Honda could be stolen using a cheap screwdriver--and (since I live in Miami) it was! The lock includes a green-glowing surround that dims slowly after entry, helpful if the dome light has been set not to light when the doors are opened. There are two map lights integrated into the dome light, by pressing in their centers a brighter light can be cast for either front seat occupant.

The AC is cold, though the compressor clutch buzz at low RPM's has defied all remedies. The tan/brown interior has remained surprisingly attractive despite normal use (although I have shampooed a couple of times). Instruments are logically arranged in a well-positioned binnacle and highly readable white-on-black with slightly greenish lighting at night. It is occasionally the source of nagging squeaks. All of the plastic still looks new, including the three-spoke steering wheel's soft rim, save some wear on the top of the shift knob and a bit of cracking near the rear seatback release buttons. The carpets are a high-quality cut pile, as are the long-wearing floor mats--my driver's mat only recently lost its tougher-pile underfoot section, and it's sturdily anchored by a grommet and post at one corner; though the two-tone (darker where your body touches, lighter on sides and door panels) woven seat fabric appears somewhat less luxurious. Despite this, during its early years the car was not garaged, with no appreciable sun damage to the interior resulting. 

The white paint, however, did not fare so well. I had it repainted by Maaco a year ago. I hear from others that red paint on Mazdas is very poor in terms of durability. Door dings are a problem, as this puppy has no protective plastic, nor does the design provide any attractive way to add it. Both outside mirrors are power operated, and have never required attention. They fold flat against the window if they strike an obstacle (well, in reverse I suppose they would snap off). 

This car survived a serious collision in its first year, needing fender, hood, bumper, lights and a host of other mechanical and structural items. You wouldn't know it from the car's appearance, handling, durability or subsequent service history. 

The back seat is cramped, but after all, this is a 2+2 configuration--nonetheless, adults do fit back there for short trips. Cargo space is fairly capacious (although liftover is high), and even more so with the rear seatback folded (it doesn't quite make the entire area flat, except in case of heavy items weighing it down). The removable privacy lid received some rough treatment and cracked at the center of the axis of its attachment. To repair it, I used a section of quarter-round dowel from Home Depot discreetly screwed to the underside as a brace. The gas struts still hold the liftgate up (propelling it unassisted on hotter days), it's almost all glass (doesn't heat the car too badly), even including a small vertical glass section a la the 2nd generation CRX. The view to the rear is acceptable. 

The ride can be a little choppy, and the car skitters a bit in the rain, especially if the rubber isn't fresh--but on the whole the handling is even, predictable, precise and tight. The original Yokohamas stunk (tires mounted at the rear developed inner-edge cupping on several occasions), subsequent better-quality Pep Boys touring tires (Futura 2000 LTEs) have proven far superior and quite economical. 

The original alloy wheels are unpainted, but clean up surprisingly easily and stay looking good (except their center Mazda badges, which recently began losing their silver paint and exposing black plastic--easily remedied when I get around to it). They come with one lock lug each (which have successfully kept them on the car)--make sure you get the keyed wrench head from the seller--it should be with the lug wrench under the plywood cargo floor, along with the spacesaver spare. I have had to repaint the wiper arms black on one or two occasions because weathering was exposing the metal. I consider this a normal maintenance item on any Japanese car. 

The car has automatic seat belts, not airbags (which were added to later models). Occasionally, the inertia reel will lock as the belt moves into place, resulting in a constricting effect necessitating pressing the emergency release button above and behind you--if you panic easily, this will definitely do it for you! The path the belt travels, however, has no abrupt corners ... which on other cars dooms the reliability of the auto-belts. The seats themselves are reasonably Recaro-like, though they have only manual front-rear and recline adjustments. The front-rear adjustment can fail to fully latch, resulting in a disconcerting seat movement and "clunk" when it later does so while you're moving. For that matter, the lockable glovebox door also requires care to assure it is fully latched, or it will fall open suddenly at some later time. The console armrest is conveniently placed, unless you happen to be trying to use the small chrome-wire cupholder that folds down from its lid--it sucks. There's also not much room in there, although toward the front it provided a perfect fit for an aftermarket coin dispenser I bought to remedy the car's lack of dedicated coin storage. 

Road noise is an issue on longer, high-speed drives--this is not a Lexus (quieter now for me because after a minor flooding incident, I stripped the sodden spottily-segmented backing from the carpet and laid down a more-or less solid piece of carpet underlayment from Home Depot). There is some slight wind noise, and rubber window seals can develop a crinkling effect at the top rear corner that interferes with cranking, necessitating straightening and regluing. But the car has surprisingly long legs, and the gas pedal position doesn't make you wish for cruise control. There is also a dead pedal for the left foot. The headlights provide good illumination on dark roads, although their lenses have yellowed and fogged a bit with age. 

Maintenance runs about $500 a year, and consists of the usual oil changes, batteries, wiper blades, filters, brake jobs (I've always refused having the rotors resurfaced [IMHO unnecessary unless they're grooved, in which case they likely need replacing anyway]), tires, and the occasional small surprise. The bushings on the front brakes were of a too-mild steel, and flat spotted with a resulting "clunk-clunk-clunk" under moderate braking. Although not a danger, I had them replaced for about $60. The A/C evaporator had to be replaced, as did the A/C compressor (no luck: the new one buzzes like the old). I replaced the wiper motor a few years ago. The ignition cylinder had to replaced due to the aforementioned unsuccessful theft attempt. I also replaced a speedometer cable, and the occasional bulb. Except for the brake bushings and A/C buzz, I've never considered anything that happened to be out of the ordinary for a car of its age and usage.
