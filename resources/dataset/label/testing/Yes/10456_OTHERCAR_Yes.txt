            I bought the Z71 version with most of the option packages except the luggage rack and the side steps.  I have had the truck since the beginning of December 2003.  I am thoroughly pleased with the truck.  I did not have any reason to return the truck to the dealer for adjustment etc.  The fit and finish were totally correct on delivery. Although it is an off road truck, it is great on the highway during long trips.  Road noise is minimal. The special features such as moving gas and brake pedals for drivers with different sized legs and the satellite radio are novel to me and great. The radio compensates for road noise, but it was a bit difficult to get it right as the sound is adjusted via preset increments.  It was a bit expensive, but with the rebates etc, the truck is well worth the price I paid.  The truck is loaded with nifty features and will overwhelm you with information from the direction you are traveling and the temperature outside to the precise amount of fuel you are consuming at the moment.  That can be quite scary as the V8 loves to drink gas.  All things considered, I found the truck to be well built with unique design aspects that make the truck fun to own.  I would not hesitate to recommend this truck to anyone wanting some fun, luxury, and the ability to haul a Christmas tree, lumber, etc. on those rare occasions when you have to use it as a truck.
