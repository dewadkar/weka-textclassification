                 Yesterday I had the thorough opportunity to ride around Atlanta with some of my friends in my buddy's Mitsubishi Mirage.  To be honest, I was completely surprised when I found that this car is classified as a subcompact.  When I think &quot;subcompact&quot; I think of cars like the <b>Hyundai Accent</b> or the <b>Ford Festiva</b>- these cars look and feel subcompact.

     Why was I surprised?  Because the Mitsubishi Mirage's excellent engineering had me fooled.

     For starters we rode around Atlanta all night with five people in the vehicle at all times.  There was <b>ample room</b> for all of us, although when I rode in the back later in the night it was a little cramped.  This is a mallady that you simply must get used to if you're going to buy a subcompact.  I strongly advise those over six feet to sit up front at all times.

     Adding to my suprise was the vehicle's <b>excellent pickup</b>, afforded by a 115-hp engine with adequate torque.  On the manual model I rode in low-end torque was nothing special, but at cruising speed the engine hummed along with no difficulties whatsoever.  This is really good considering we had five people in this vehicle.

     <b>Handling was quick and precise</b>, and there was no difficulty dodging in and out of traffic.  The strut system is a little hard but more then adequate for everyday travel- like most subcompacts the Mirage is best kept out of rough driving conditions such as dirt roads.  At 80 mph the ride was smooth and umarred by bumps.

     <b>Interior design is minimalistic but well done</b>, with cup holders standard and visibility excellent.  This model had a motled gray tile pattern on the cloth, and it did look good.  One noticable problem was lack of a console storage area, but this is again pretty much par for the course on subcompacts.  The base sound package is excellent for a subcompact.

    If you buy this model, opt for power everything.  There isn't enough elbow room to reach the <b>awkwardly placed window levers and door locks</b>.  Door design is good but everything placed there is in unusual positions.

    All in all the Mirage is a good choice for the urban driver with a short commute, however I do not recommend it for anyone with a long drive every day.  The Mitsubishi Galant is better for that task.  Still, the Mirage is a solid competitor in the subcompact market, affording comforts normally reserved for compacts.<br><br>
