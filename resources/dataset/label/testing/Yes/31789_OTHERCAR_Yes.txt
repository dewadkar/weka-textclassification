            I recently bought the 2001 Honda Civic Coupe (4 door). To be honest with you it wasn't a hard decision. I have owned two Honda's previously- 1988 Prelude and 1994 Accord. I never had any problems with either car, other than the Accord being wrecked, but of course not Honda's fault.

As I arrived at my local Honda dealer, I had my notebook in hand, jotting down any information given to me. The salesperson was very knowledgable about the Honda Civic Coupe, answering every question I asked and asked his supervisor when there was one question that stumped him. I was very impressed with the dealership.

But as we all know, the car itself is what sells. 

I knew going in that I wanted to Honda Civic Coupe EX. There are four Civic Coupes available, each different mostly because of options: EX, LX, HX, DX

The Honda Civic Coupe comes in array of interior/exterior colors (but still depending on which model you choose):

Clover Green Pearl/Beige
Taffeta White/Beige
Eternal Blue Pearl/Beige
Inca Pearl/Black
Satin Silver Metallic/Black
Rallye Red/Black
Rallye Red/Beige
Nighthawk Black Pearl/Black (my choice)

SAFETY
As you know, this is THE most important factor. All the Honda Civic Coupes are standardly equipped with the following:
steal door beams
dual front airbags
3 point seat belts
front crush zone
anti lock braking


My car in particular, the EX, is very roomy. My mother, brother, nephew and myself made a trip to New Jersey a month ago. We were comfortable through the duration of the trip (well as comfortable as you can be driving on a long trip). The numbers for head room and leg room for the EX are as follows:
head room (front to rear) 36.9/35.0
leg room (front to rear)42.5/32.8

And the gas mileage was fantastic, but all of my Honda's have had superb gas mileage. Here again are the numbers:
 5 speed(manual) -32/37
 4 speed (automatic)31/38

OPTIONS &amp; ACCESSORIES
There are many options and accessories that can be installed before your purchase or can be added later. On my Honda Civic Coupe EX, the following are standard (yet there are still more than I will list):

Air Conditioning w/Micron Air-Filtration
CD Player w/6 Speakers and Anti-Theft
Power Door Locks
Cruise control
Adjustable Steering Column
Remote Trunk Release w/Lock
60/40 Split Fold Down Rear Seatback w/Lock
Beverage Holder (front and rear)
Remote Fuel Filler Door Release
Tires- All Season- 15&quot; w/ full covers

Being that I have only had my Honda Civic Coupe for 11 weeks, I cannot comment on  this automobile's overall performance. But I anticipate the same satisfaction as I had with the previous Honda's I have owned.
