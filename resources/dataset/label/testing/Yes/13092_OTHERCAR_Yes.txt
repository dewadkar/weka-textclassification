            I bought my Honda Accord two door about 4 months ago. I absolutely love it! I wanted a white one so the dealership located one for me and also added a spoiler. I like them with the spoiler much better. It adds a little touch of &quot;sport&quot; to it. It also has a moon roof and tan interior. The tan interior is great because it doesn't pick up all the dirt so it doesn't look as dirty. 
The interior of my car is laid out very well. I like the spacious compartments. The glove box is big also and you can fit a ton of stuff in there without it sticking out. It is also very roomy. There is plenty of space in the back seat as well as the trunk.
It rides very smooth and is very comfortable to drive. The seats are very nice. Plus they have dual side airbags to ensure safety. The alarm system and automatic locks also help to keep you safe. 
The only thing that I find as a downfall to buying this car is that it is one of the highest ranked new cars for theft. So be careful where you park yours!! :) 
I think that this car would be a great first car because it is very dependable and it also holds it's value. Though a little pricey for a fist time car. But this car is really good for anyone at any age. Even those new parents that need something with a little more room, this is a great car. Much better looking than the mini-van!!<br><br>
