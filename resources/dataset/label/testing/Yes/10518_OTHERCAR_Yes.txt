            The redesigned 3.2TL is probably the best value around in the near-luxury class.  It's way cheaper than the Lexus ES300, and a way better ride than the Infiniti I30.  The Camry XLE V6 would be comparable, but for a comparable price the TL comes with the Navigation System.  (Without the Navigation System, it's actually less expensive than the Camry XLE V6.)

The leather interior, heated seats, dual power seats, auto-dim mirror, sunroof, and other features make the TL luxurious.  The 225 horse VTEC engine and &quot;SportShift&quot; make it fun to drive.  And the navigation system makes it a REALLY COOL TOY!  We've had ours since May, and we've loved every minute of it.

In case you aren't familiar with the navigation system concept, it works off of GPS (the Global Positioning Satellite system) plus a &quot;gyro sensor&quot; which detects which direction you are facing and which direction you are turning.  If you've ever rented a car from Hertz with their &quot;NeverLost&quot; system, it's like that, only better, because theirs (at least a few years ago) used a CD-ROM which only had maps for a single metropolitan area, whereas the Acura system uses a DVD-ROM which has maps for the entire US.  This means that you can get directions FROM ANYWHERE in the US TO ANYWHERE in the US.  You can program it by address, but in addition, it has a huge &quot;yellow pages&quot; database so you can select destinations by name or category.  For example, if you are looking for a restaurant called &quot;Jimmy's Steakhouse&quot;, just put in the name, or go to the restaurant category and browse the names.  You can ask it to sort by the nearest to your current location, so for example, you can get to the nearest ATM, gas station, supermarket, etc., even if you are in completely unfamiliar territory.  And it really works!  We've already taken a number of road trips to places where we didn't know our way around, and it has been awesome.  When we were in a town in the middle of nowhere and ran out of diapers for our baby, we just asked for the closest drug store, and voila!, we had diapers 5 minutes later.  It shows you and TELLS you (by voice!) EXACTLY where to turn -- it even works in rotaries!<br><br>
