            THE VITARA CONVERTIBLE IS DEFINATELY A NICE CAR TO LOOK AT. THE CONVERTIBLE TOP AND SUNROOF MAKE IT ALOT OF FUN IN THE SUMMER ESPECIALLY ON THE BEACH. IT GETS GOOD GAS MILEAGE AND IS MUCH ROOMIER THAN IT APPEARS. MOST COME WITHOUT AIR OR A CD PLAYER WHICH IS A DOWNFALL. I TALKED THE DEALER INTO ADDING AIR CONDITIONING. ALSO FOR THOSE WHO DESIRE A CD PLAYER, THE TAPE DECK ALREADY HAS A CHANGER CONTROL SO IT IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TO GET A CHANGER. I PURCHASED AN ALPINE CHANGER TO GO ALONG WITH THE STANDARD ALPINE TAPE DECK IN THE VITARA. THIS CAR IS GREAT FOR ME BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT BECAUSE ITS GREAT TO CRUISE AROUND IN. THE DOWNFALLS WOULD HAVE TO BE ITS LIGHT WEIGHT AND CHEAP INTERIOR WHICH I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH. NOTHING MAJOR BUT SMALL THINGS SUCH AS AIR VENTS AND THE SUN VISORS. THE WARRANTY HAS COVERED EVERYTHING THOUGH SO NO WORRIES.I DEFINATELY THING THIS CAR IS A GREAT ONE TO HAVE. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE YOUNG AT HEART.
