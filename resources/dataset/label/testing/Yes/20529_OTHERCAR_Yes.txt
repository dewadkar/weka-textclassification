            The Chrysler Cirrus is in the same class as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.  Feature for feature you get a lot more for your money with the Cirrus.  I got a 6 cylinder, with antilock brakes, leather and a sunroof for the price of a 4 cylinder Accord or Camry.<br>The body style of the Cirrus is a few years old...but still seems fresh and is much sportier than most in its class.  The fit and finish on my Cirrus was excellent and has stayed excellent through the first 17, 000 miles. One complaint...I wish the wiperblades could be hidden.<br><br>The interior is fitted in leather and the seats are quite comfortable.  The dash is well layed out.  Unfortunately a CD player is not standard.  There is room for 4 very comfortably and 5 relatively comfortable.  Trunk room is good, without hinges protruding into the trunk to rob space.<br><br>The six cylinder is more than adequate...but not &quot;boy racer&quot; powerful.  However this car just cruies so very nicely on the interstate.<br><br>Overall, I am extremely pleased with this car and would buy one again.<br><br><br>
