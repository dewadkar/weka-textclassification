            I have had my Rendezvous for almost three months and I love it.  I wasn's sure about this car, because I thought the back end was ugly.  But after I drove this one and other SUV's (Trailblazer and Envoy), the Rendezvous drove the best and better options for the money.

The Rendezvous drives very smooth, more like a luxury car than an SUV.  It is very roomy and comfortable even if you are riding in the option third row seat.  It has an excellent sound system and great storage space.  It is the convenience of a mini-van and SUV, but with out the look of the mini-van and the rough drive of the SUV.


Some of the options are the Heads Up Display (this is a great option), detectors when backing up, six cd disk changer as part of the main radio, six way electrical seats for passenger and driver (the driver has two memory settings)and many more options.

The only downfall with this car, is the engine could be a bit more powerful.  When going up a hill, be ready to push down the gas to keep going at a steady pace.  The back can be hard to shut also.

I have been stopped quite a few times getting of my car by people who are interested in the Rendezvous to see if I like the car.  I tell them that I love it and I highly recommend it.
