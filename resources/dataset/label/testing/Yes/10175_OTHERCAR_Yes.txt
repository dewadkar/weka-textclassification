            When looking for a new car to travel to and from cottage country the natural choice was 4 wheel drive. And having seen all available SUV's when buying a new car, the Lexus had it all.

Simply perfect fit and finish inside and out. Supple leather, texture everywhere, and seating that accomodates long drives with ample adjustments and room for 4 adults. Of all the SUV's out there, the RX300 offered all creature comforts including heated seats, cozy leather, outstanding A/C and heating system, gadgets to entertain the passengers, ample performance (hey others go faster and sound better on the street, but you pay at the pumps and in quality), smooth and quiet ride in all conditions and a reputation that hasn't let me down.

This car has been through all the seasons twice with me and I cannot say anything negative about its handling, performance, ride or quality. The RX300 has been off-road on construction sites, plowing through 2 feet of snow on a country road, sitting in traffic in the heat of summer, and even wet its tires in shallow streams (not with my wife's blessing). And never a complaint from the car or its occupants.

Plus, the quality and durability has paid off with very low maintenance costs for such a vehicle.

If you're considering an SUV, wagon or general family mover, this is a definite contender.<br><br>
