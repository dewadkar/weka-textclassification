            Hi drove this car for a year and really enjoyed every minute of it. I was visiting my family in Qatar and I shared this car with my sister. At first I thought that it was a tiny that would not have any hope with my driving, but it really measured up.

Firstly the cabin inside(front seats point of view) is roomy and the air con is simply great. I enjoyed it the most at night as the cabin was nice and silent while driving and the stereo system felt like it was far too much for the car.

Fuel consumption is an amazing factor and that is what I can remember about it the most. Being in that country helped too as petrol was majorly cheap for it. Sometimes when you're a little bored and really put your foot down, it honestly respondes. Don't let the size fool you :0). I would honestly buy this car. Pity that when she moved back to England she had to sell it:0(

I honestly don't have many bad words to say about this car.
