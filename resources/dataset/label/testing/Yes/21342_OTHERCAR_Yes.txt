            Lets get this straight from the start. I'm 15. My parents bought the car. For themselves. But I ride in it enough so I think I can write an opinion if I want.  Anyway. This car wass very recomended to us by my parents friends, and I can see why. The ride is very smooth and confortable, and it is very reliable. We live on Long Island and my mom drives it every day into queens to teach. And it still runs smooth. Now even though this will take a few years off the life, it seems to be running strong after about a year. The stereo is also excellent, exept when we're going faster than 60 because the sound of the road on the tires is louder than the radio (im not allowed to listen to my music loud).<br><br>
