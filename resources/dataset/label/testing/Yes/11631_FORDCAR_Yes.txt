            Do you live in snow country? Do you have a family? Do you cart a lot of stuff around in your car?  Then the Ford Explorer is a good choice for you...
I bought this car because I was living in North Dakota at the time... where it snows on average, 7 months out of the year. The year I bought it was a record-breaking winter, and I was never housebound due to the reliability of this car in bad weather.

This car provides you with all the same look and feel of the current trendy SUV's and sits in the middle of the pack on gas mileage.  The Explorer has a comfortable fit with a smooth ride.  I feel very secure with my two young children in this car.

I've made several long-distance road trips in this car, including one cross-country with my (very) pregnant wife, three dogs and a cat -- without so much as a complaint about the room and comfort of this car.

However, if you have children that will need to be in car seats for a few years, I recommend the four door over the two door as the height of the car and the ease of access to the backseat can be cumbersome when dealing with car seats... it can be done but is difficult.<br><br>
