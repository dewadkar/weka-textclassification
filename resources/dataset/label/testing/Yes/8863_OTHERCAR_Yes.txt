            I purchased a 2000 Honda Accord EX V6 with the leather package in June 2000.  I have not found one thing to complain about.

This baby is quick!  The Accord V6 has terrific responsiveness, great suspension, good brakes, good gas mileage, and an enormous amount of trunk space.  I have never had anyone sit in my car and be uncomfortable.  It handles like a dream.  I can not even count the number of compliments I have had on it.

It has several compartments to stick things in, such as: a nifty sunglasses holder built into the roof, 2 convenient cup holders that hide when you want them to, and a change drawer to the left of the steering wheel.

The stereo has great sound.  The radio sounds like a CD.

For those of you who wish to be environmentally friendly, you will notice when you fill up the Accord that at most filling stations the gas pump fits perfectly snug around the gas tank opening.  This reduces the amount of fumes that are released into the environment.

As far as maintenance, I have had no problems.  In fact, the guys at the garage love to see the new Accords coming.  They are mechanic-friendly cars.  The guys say that they are easy to figure out.
