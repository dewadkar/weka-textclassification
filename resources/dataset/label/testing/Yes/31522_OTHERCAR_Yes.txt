            When I finally decided it was time to replace by 7 year old Bonneville, I went out shopping for a new car.  Being only 5'2&quot; tall I really like the compact cars.  We shopped around for weeks and I looked at all the compacts out there.  I've never bought into the notion of staying with the same car manufacturer every time so I gave them all a try.

When I drove the Sentra for the first time, I really enjoyed it.  It seemed to fit me perfectly.  I really like the way the seats form around your body and everything on the dash is accessible.  It is very compact though.  The rest of my family is much taller than I am, especially my husband and son.  There isn't much room in the front or back seats for anyone taller than myself.  My husband is very uncomfortable driving for any length of time, and forget taking a long vacation.  We did go to California last summer and only our daughter traveled with us.  She is only 5'4&quot; and complained the whole time that there was no room in the back seat.  Although the car did great, it's not really comfortable for travel.

All in all, I have to say I enjoy the car.  It fits my needs.  It's compact, and gets great gas mileage.  Being a 4 cylinder it doesn't have much &quot;get up&quot; to it, but I live in metropolitan Phoenix and with the traffic congestion you don't have many opportunities to &quot;floor&quot; it.  Since I primarily drive the car to and from my job, it fits my needs perfectly.<br><br>
