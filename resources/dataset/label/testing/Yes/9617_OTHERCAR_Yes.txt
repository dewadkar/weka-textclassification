            My wife and I both fell in love with this car at first sight. We are former Trans Am and Camaro fans.  The new Toyota Celica offered us a car with sharp lines and the fun of driving to boot. This Celica really turns heads and elicits comments wherever you go. Besides the great looks our Toyota Celica GT is economical and has enough power to stay just ahead of where you want to be. This is really a fun car to drive and is responsive to the road and curves. The interior is like a small space ship console which adds to the flavor of this machine. Great stereo CD/cassette/am/fm with good speakers top off the quality of this car.  This car is for the young and the young at heart that do not mind turning a few heads.  Good job Toyota.<br><br>
