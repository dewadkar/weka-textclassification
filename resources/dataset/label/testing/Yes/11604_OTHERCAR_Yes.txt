            I have owned my 1999 Holden Frontera (Australian spec Isuzu Rodeo) for 15 months and am very impressed by the vehicle.
Reciently I have fitted a 3" suspension kit and 31x10.5x15 BFG All Terrains. This has Given me a 5" lift overall.
I am also going to fit a second fuel tank to give me around 130 litres of fuel (1000km+)
This Has only been done due to the long distances and rough terrain that the vehicle is used in.
The vehicle has performed faultlesly for 40000km.
The only faults with this vehicle have been fixed through only bolt on mods. But this vehicle would be ok for a suburban 4X4 in standard form...
