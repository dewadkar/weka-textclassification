            I have been researching SUVs for almost a year now; getting ready to trade-in my 1993 Saturn SL2 for something bigger for those family road-trips and also something that will do better on our gravel drive that basically turns to mud and mush when it snows or rains.  After looking at several different compact/midsize SUVS, I kept returning to the Honda CR-V each time.  The only thing that really turned me off at first were the smallish wheels that just look out of proportion with the rest of the vehicle.  But now I don't notice that as much.

I bought my first Honda CR-V this past weekend.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I chose the EX model in Eternal Blue Pearl w/black interior.  The two strangest things about the interior are the gear shift location for the automatic (which is what I got) and the parking brake.  The gear shift in ON the dashboard instead of the usual locations of either the steering column or the floor.  This did take some getting used to, but only a small amount of time.  The other oddity is the parking brake location which is integrated into the side of the middle console.  This frees up quite a bit of floor space with having these two controls out of the way.  

The EX comes base with the following features:  ABS brakes, front and side airbags; moonroof; power windows/locks; cruise control; 6 in-dash CD changer/cassette/radio w/6 speakers; alloy wheels; privacy glass and keyless entry.  The CD player has an anti-theft feature and the ignition key is made where if somebody tries to start the car "illegally" the engine will stall.  A full security system is available but is an accessory.  I purchased no accessories or options.

I especially like the retractable tray table that is between the front seats.  This folds down out of the way so I can put my purse there or something else.  The only thing I don't like about the table is that the cupholders aren't big enough for those oversized drink cups. However, there is a single cup holder that pulls out from the console that is big enough for the oversized drinks. But what if you have two?  In the back, the middle portion of the seat folds down to reveal an armrest and two more cupholders giving a total of 5 cupholders.  The two front seats also have elbow rests that fold down but I have found them to be too low to rest my elbow adequately.  Maybe I have short arms.  

There are two storage bins in the front console beneath the heating/cooling controls.  One is big enough to store a cell phone and some other trinkets while the next one down is big enough to store up to 5 CDs in their cases.  There is also a locking glove box which also has a light.  Overhead there is a sunglass storage case with two map lights.  Each visor has a vanity mirror -- unlighted though. Also, the visors are large enough to actually BLOCK the blinding sunlight without totally impairing your vision. There is a passenger area light and also a cargo area light.  The EX model comes with privacy glass which was a plus for me.  The main things I looked at as "options" were the keyless entry; privacy glass and 6 CD changer which were all "standard" on the EX model.  

The heating system is very outstanding. You can't say that you will be cold driving this car cause the hot air that blows from those vents would surely burn your hand if you let it rest on the panel too long. I have yet to test the A/C considering it's still dead of winter right now, but the other day, I did become a little too hot and turned the heat off and let the fan run on cool with no A/C running and that air was rather cool in itself.  Of course, the outside temp was probably 40 but still I remember in my Saturn, the air would still be on the lukewarm side.  So, I have confidence that the A/C will be outstanding as well.

There is 33 cubic space of cargo room with the rear seats UP.  This will be more than plenty to put our luggage and beach stuff when we make our annual trek to Florida this year.  The cargo floor lifts up to reveal a "wet" storage area and as many of you might already know, the floor also comes out to turn into that infamous Honda picnic table.  Honestly, I don't know if we'll EVER use this feature, but I certainly like that hidden storage area.  The cargo door also has a storage bin, but it's really only big enough to hold small things.  

The spare tire is a full-sized spare and hangs on the back.  Even like this, you still have enough visibility out the back window.  A tip though is to remove the middle head-rest because this does block your view somewhat.  The side mirrors are large and give ample visibility when passing and going in reverse.  

I find the comfort level very high.  The rear bench is rather firm but I don't think this will be a problem even on long trips.  The front seats are firm as well but I don't find them uncomfortable in the least.  The CR-V has very smooth handling when it comes to driving and is much more smooth than my Saturn in going over bumps and such.  The turning radius is awesome.  I don't feel like I'm driving anything bigger than what I did previously.  You can swing right into those tight parking spaces without fear of having to back up 15 times to make sure you're straight. The engine runs extremely quite and there is little to no road noise.  

The rear seats recline and also move forward or back to give you extra leg room.  If you need extra cargo space, the rear bench flips over and up to rest behind the front seats.  If you just need a little more space, the rear seats are also a 60/40 split, so you can lay only one side down and leave the other up for your passenger. 

The CR-V has real-time four wheel drive which means when it feels the front wheels slipping, the rear wheels will automatically pick up the traction.  I have already tested this feature and it works very well.  I've gone up a muddy hill without effort and across a muddy field.  Please note though, there were no boulders in my path.  I would still leave that to the JEEP.   

I am extremely happy with my purchase and have been enjoying driving the CR-V. I can't wait to take it on our first road-trip.  

The other SUVS I researched were:  
Jeep Liberty
Toyota RAV4
Saturn VUE
KIA Sorento
Hyundai Santa Fe


The price before taxes was $21,500.

Update as of May 6, 2003:  
I am still very pleased with my CR-V and wanted to comment further on the A/C since I was unable to in my original review considering it was winter time. I have not been disappointed with the A/C performance.  It is colder than cold and the fan blasts it very adequately. You can switch it over to MAX A/C power or keep it just on A/C.  So, whereas the heater will burn you up, the A/C will freeze you out.  Excellent.

We also took our first day trip and the CR-V handled wonderfully. The ride was comfortable and smooth and we got good gas mileage -- went 4 hours of interstate without having to fill the tank up (that is starting out on a full tank of gas). Going on current gas prices of an average of $1.37, it costs approximately $17 to fill the tank up.
