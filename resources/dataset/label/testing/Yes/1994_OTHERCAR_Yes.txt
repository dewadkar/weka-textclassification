            Owned a 91.  This one reminded me of it -- but better.  Speed, pickup, economy, space -- it's all there.  Sound system rocks.  Automatic controls make life comfortable.  Could do without the cigarette lighter/power outlet insert -- ruins an otherwise perfect interior cabin.  Would also add a shade for Bose speaker in rear.  Recommend privacy glass.  Not a single person in the passenger seat has been disappointed with the performance of this vehicle.  Ran it up past the speed limit (considerably) with no effort.  (Used to run the 91 in Montana before they reinstated the speed limit.  Did 105-110 for long stretches, fully loaded, with no problem.) 

Great car in a long tradition of great cars.

Not a Q45, but not your father's maxima, either.<br><br>
