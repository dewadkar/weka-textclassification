            This car is a dream.  Going from a 4 cylinder Chevy Cavalier, I found my own little piece of heaven with my GT1, 2door.  For starters, I looked into the particular class of cars to see what was comparable and make an honest effort to get as much car for the dollar as possible.  In the class I liked the Oldsmobile Alero and the Toyota Solora.  Out of the group I had a friend who had an Alero and was relatively happy with the car, so I had an idea.  I test drove the Toyota and found I felt the car, while rather perky, was too much on the level of an luxury version, a sort of I am older and my children are off to college type of car.  I was looking for something that would keep up with me, a car for the 20ish age group which was stylish and sleek, but most importantly performed well.  then I found just that....

The 2000 Pontiac Grand AM GT.  As soon as I saw the Silver Beauty in the lot it called my name.  Unlike the other I felt it had a very stylish design that would last far into the next millennium.  It had features comparable to the Toyota, but sitting in the interior I felt more of a racing style, rather than a luxury style, which was what I was looking for.  The Ram Air V-6 provides all the perk you will need, all the 175 horsepower you will need.  While it is quick off the start, most impressive is its willingness to really step it up around 50 when you need the extra boost to pass quickly.  

It will out perform the older Mustang Base 94-98 Model.  I was always a die-hard 'Stang fan and was a little hesitant when the salesman told us, but I put it to the test and it rose to the occasion quite nicely!  It was able to really pull away off the start and change my opinion of my once favorite car.  

You will find a lot of bang for your buck with this car.  The GT1 comes with CD player, sunroof, keyless entry, and much more.  It's interior styling is outstanding and sure to impress.  Its air vents will reach you no matter where you sit with their neat swivel design.

Anyone in the market for a mid-class sporty car should give the Grand Am a serious second thought.  It offers power and affordability to all and will wow you with its performance over and over again!
