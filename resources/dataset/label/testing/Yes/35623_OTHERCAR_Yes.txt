            We bought this car after having a 99 Toyota Camry fro a few days. We thought the Camry was great, but when we drove the Malibu we knew we were in love. It has so much more room than the Camry. Head room especially. We are big people and you wouldn't think you would notice something that seems so minor, but we noticed it as soon as we got in. You definitly notice a big difference in the price. The trunk size is the same. Plenty of room for groceries and the full size stroller we keep in ours. Leg room for people who sit in back is not the greatest. Especially for people who are are in the driver seat and passenger seats and like to it farther back. But we don't have a problem getting our 13 month old in and out of the car. We've never had a mechanical problem with this car what so ever.Just the usual oil changes. What I really like is that the car must be in park in order to pop the trunk button open. The back seat is also big enough for 3 car seats. Whereas the Camry my mom has only fits two. No way you could squeeze a third in. <br><br>
