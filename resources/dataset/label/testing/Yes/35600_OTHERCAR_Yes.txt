                 I recently purchased a 1998 Chevy Malibu.  I didn't have much time to shop around for a car because the 1996 Dodge Intrepid I traded in was about ready to fall apart and I wanted to trade it while it was still running!!  I paid 10,000, and felt like I got a pretty good deal.  
     After I had the car for about a week, I realized I made a mistake.  There wasn't anything wrong with the car, I just was bored with it pretty quick.  I really couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about it.  For one, it didn't have rear defrost.  I didn't notice that until the first freeze.  Stupid, huh?  Rear defrost is just something I've always taken for granted.  I didn't care for the tires on it.  They were pretty wide and didn't get around good on slick surfaces.  The car didn't really ride very smooth either and was kind of loud for a car.  I did like the cup holders though.  The cup holders in the front were large enough to fit a &quot;McDonalds super-sized drink&quot;.  It also had 2 cup holders in the back seat.  The car seemed pretty mechanically sound though.  The engine seemed to run a little hot.  I checked with the dealer and they said that was normal.  I was most disappointed by the gas mileage though.  I had a 3.1 v-6 in it and was only getting about 21-22 miles per gallon.  Also, for a 6 cylinder, it didn't have much get up &amp; go.
    I only kept the car for about 3 months, then traded it on a 1996 Chevy Blazer, which I love.
    This is not a bad car if you're looking for something cheap and reliable.  It was just not the car for me.<br><br>
