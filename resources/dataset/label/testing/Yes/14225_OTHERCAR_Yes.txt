            I bought this camera a month ago and selected it because it has so many extra features that comparable cameras in the same price range don't have.
After using it for a month I highly recommend it, mainly because it's fun to use because of it's &quot;extra&quot; features such as the movie and panorama modes that play back on screen to the amazement of friends.  Don't buy this nor any other 2.1 megapixel camera if you're low on hard disk space, since each pic takes up around 800K.<br><br>
