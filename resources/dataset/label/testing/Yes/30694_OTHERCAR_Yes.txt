            I purchased my Sunfire in June.  I was actually looking at a 1999 Grand Am and was coming back the next morning to pick in up.  The dealer informed me that he had just got this car in and I should test drive it.  

Well one look and I was in love with this car, it had my name written all over it, a sporty body in a classy color, (champagne I think.)  Once I got inside I saw that it was equipped with all the amenities, copious amount of cup holders, cruise control and yes a smoking kit.  The sound system was insane, great sound in front and back, am/fm stereo cd player and programmable stations.  The system was so nice I thought that it was an luxury model, but it wasn't just standard.  

The car drove nicely, it accelerates great and didn't rattle over certain speeds.  The one draw back were the breaks.  Although the ABS is awesome, you must either break early or hard due to the weird breaking distances. The breaks also squeak sometimes on turns.

Over all the Sunfire is a great driving experience. The seats are comfortable, I drove 7 hours straight with out so much as an ache in my rear end, or a cramp in my leg.

The interior is roomy in the front, but I am only 5'5&quot;.  My assistant who is 6'9' had a really hard time fitting in the passenger seat.  Also has ample trunk, glove and middle compartment room.  

The a/c is great, although I don't run it as much as I should because I seem to get reduced gas mileage when i run it constantly.  Overall I get about 25-35 highway miles to the gallon and between 15 and 20 in stop and go traffic.  

I think that this is a great vehicle for a student as it is affordable, okay on gas and relatively low maintenance as far as break down and repairs go.  The warranty package is awesome also.

I think that families should probably invest in the 4 door model, instead of the coupe, as there is more room in the rear.
