            The discontinued Cadillac machine, Fleetwood Brougham, is one of the nicest, and luxurious Caddie's ever made. When you sit in the nice plush leather seats with the adjustable lumbar support and heating system you begin to realize that &quot;this is the way to live&quot;. It is beyond me why Cadillac would even dream about discontinuing this road monster. Since america wants to downsize luxury and mid-size cars, like the Fleetwood, and Up-size Suz's like the Ford Excursion Cadillac has discontinued their only large size car and started making an all new SUV called the Escalade, which is just a definate Cadillac copy of the Chevy Yukon Denali. The fleetwood, has power everything along with leather seats, a great Bose sound system and a sensor for the air conditioning to unnoticibly change the temperature of the car as with the road. Another unknown feature of the car that make me think that it has a mind of it's own, is a sensor for the stereo system that turns up the radio at high speeds to drownd out the sound of your tires on pavement. If you can find one I definitely suggest you pick it up and at least go for a test drive.<br><br>
