                 I have been a satisfied Saturn driver for almost six years.  I've leased two Saturns, one in 1994, and one in 1997.  Both of them have been SC2s.  One of the best things about driving a Saturn is the terrific service. 
     Saturn technicians cannot do enough to assist you in anyway they can.  The car is reliable and sleek.  The small back seat is well compensated for by the roomy, comfortable front seat with both driver side and passenger side airbags.  The large 4-cylinder engine provides excellent acceleration and goes up to 130 mph.
     Saturn is a great car for the money.  I haven't had the chance to drive any of the new Saturns, but if they are anything like their older models then they are definitely worth trying.  Look for Saturn to release it's first SUV within the next few years.
