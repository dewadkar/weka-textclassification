                         This car, to say the least, is not something that you want to try to impress your friends w/.  Some economical-minded older people may appreciate it though.  
           My mom bought the car in 1997 from a dealership. The engine had more miles than we thought it did so guess what happened. The engine shelled out after only a few miles (about 1000). We could have sued the guy but did not think that it was worth it. We simply had a new engine  put in from a trusted local mechanic. And let me tell you a Geo w/ a good engine really does well ; I don't care what Consumer Reports says. That little thing drove 200 miles a day w/o complaining. However, when the miles get up there the engine goes down. I think of it as a drop from a 4 cylinder to a 3 1/2 cylinder. And the mechanic said that it did loose about half of its engine power. but w/ not a single  extra on it to hurt its performance, it  carried 4 kids and 1 adult to the movies many times and 3 fully grown adults to Iowa City and back many times (each each IA city trip about 300 miles total) w/o a single scraping of the rear bumper. And w/ only about 50 ponies, it  accomplished every task set before it very well.
             With 150,000 miles on it, the ac went out and no one could fix it. The heater worked very well and I believe that it still does. There is no rust on it. The manual windows and locks still work. It has been through several hail storms and didn't get a single dent on it. The interior is holding up very well. There are no rattles , and everything feels substantial. The engine sounds great, although it has trouble making it up to the top of a series of  steep hills near Boone. It will keep running as long as you want it to. In other words, Geos are evil little cars that have minds of their own and if they hear you putting them down , they'll pay you back, believe me!
               Now my grandparents have it and my grandpa now calls it the  "Bug". He's used to driving VW bugs his entire life and thinks that it looks sort of like an old bug so hense the name "Bug". He loves his little Geo, the father of the PT Cruiser!
