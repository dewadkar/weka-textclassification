            When referring to Volvo, most people know that it's considered one of the safest cars in the world.  But, I think Volvo has much more to offer with the new S40 than just safety.  For starters, the new S40 is more realistic in price range to those who thought they'd never be able to afford a Volvo.  Here are a few comments about the S40 that I hope you find very helpful:

EXTERIOR-
The exterior of the S40 is very sporty, especially if you opt for the sports package which will add fog lamps and a rear spoiler. The luxury look is taken away by the black, body side molding found on every S40, but this also gives it a more &quot;sporty&quot; look. The body style of the car is very nice and leaves little room for improvement.

INTERIOR-
The interior of the S40 however, could use some improvements.  The instrument cluster is well positioned and can be seen clearly from any seat position.  The radio controls are large and easy to maneuver as you're driving.  The climate control system is very comprehensive with &quot;Auto&quot; controls letting the car control the amount of air or heat that is exerted depending on the temperature that you've selected.  Volvo has also placed a cup holder in an odd location above the radio controls which can come in handy when driving, but you are unable to operate the radio with usual ease when there is a cup in this holder.  The passenger side door does not contain a control to operate the window.  This is located on the center console along with the Sport and Winter mode buttons.  This is an extremely bad position to place these window controls as you must take your eye off the road to locate them.  If the arm rest is down, then you have to put it up in order to operate them.  Other than these couple set backs, the interior of the S40 is likeable and very roomy in the front and back for the size of the car.

OPTIONS-
The S40 offers several option packages that can be added to the base model. The &quot;weather&quot; package gives you such things as the wipers on the headlights, heated seats, and traction control.  The &quot;sports&quot; package offers the upgraded stereo system with CD player, rear spoiler, fog lamps, and the leather wrapped steering wheel.  The &quot;leather&quot; package is the most expensive upgrade package and offers such things as a moon roof, leather seats, power drivers and passenger seats.  The leather package is totally loaded.  The last package offered is the one that I personally opted for on my S40, which is the &quot;touring&quot; package.  This package includes power driver's seat, leather wrapped steering wheel, cd player, and the tripometer with outside temperature gauge.

Overall, I would rate the new S40 a sporty, reliable car with room for improvement, which I expect to be coming since this is the first year for the S40 in America.  I'd definitely recommend taking the S40 for a test run and then you can decide for yourself.<br><br>
