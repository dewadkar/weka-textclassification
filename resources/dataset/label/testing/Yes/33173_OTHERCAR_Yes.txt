            This car is incredible.  I have driven it 90,000+ miles in 33 months.  I have given it only routine maintenance, and have just purchased its first new set of tires.  It still doesn't need brakes or clutch work.  

The leather driver's seat adjusts in so many ways, I am always comfortable behind the wheel. I purchased the coupe because my mother was elderly and couldn't bend her knees well so she  needed lots of room to get her feet into the car.  The coupe has a much wider door than does the sedan, and this has been a blessing many times.  

The rear seat folds down, but there isn't much pass-through space from the trunk, so I can't fit my cello in the back seat/trunk. However, there is plenty of knee room in the back seat for my adult children who are 6 ft. tall.  

What a joy this car is to drive! It hugs the road like a fine racing car, and I know because my husband both drives and repairs racing machines.  It gets 35 miles to the gallon on the highway. The VTech 4 cylinder 5-speed is the only way to go.  The 6 cylinder in this model ('97)is over-powered for the size of the car. This has been corrected in newer models.

The sedan would probably be better for people with small children needing baby or booster seats.  This coupe, however, is terrific for adults, especially if one of those adults needs extra room to get in and out of the car.

UPDATE:  5/6/02  I have now driven this car 161,000 miles and everything I said above still applies.  This car is wonderful.  Only routine maintenance, including 1 new clutch, 1 new set of brakes, and I just purchased its second set of tires a couple of days ago.  :-)
