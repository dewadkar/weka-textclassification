            I bought my Sable back in September 1997 from a Mercury dealer in NJ.  This is actually the second Ford/Lincoln/Mercury product I've owned.  I'm a past owner of a 1992 Taurus.  When I first considered buying a new car, I did a bunch of test driving (mainly through the use of different rental vehicles while away on business trips).  The clincher was taking a 2000 mile round trip from NJ to Madison, WI, for a friend's wedding, and my wife and I generally agreed that this car was a keeper.

One of the first things I look for in a car is head room.  I've been generally displeased by GM products in particular because of a lack of headroom.  The Sable, however, has been a joy to drive in this particular aspect.  My power seat puts me right on the floor, and I never bump my head -- ever.

I also look for room in the driver's seat.  I'm fat; I make no bones about that fact, but it's certainly a consideration.  The Sable holds me very comfortably and is a pleasure to drive.  Similar full-size cars like the Honda Accord are very uncomfortable because of the location of the shift on the floor, as opposed to the Sable, which has its shift on the wheel.  I drive this car 75 miles a day round trip for a commute, so it'd better be comfortable.

One minor quibble I've got is that the seat belts can occasionally get twisted and turned around from the way they were meant to be used.  It takes a while to get them back in the right position, but they're fine once they're there.

The car has had one recall notice issued for it and has only had to make one trip to the dealer for service in the 58,000 miles I've driven it.  I forget what it was for, but the visit was under $100 to fix, so I consider that to be very minor.  I think that really makes a statement about its reliability.

I must say that since I've owned my Sable, I've been very happy with it.<br><br>
