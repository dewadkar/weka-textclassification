            I purchased our new black Beetle for my wife and after driving it for a day I went crazy because I knew I had to have one for myself so I went back to the dealer and bought another beetle only this time it was a bright yellow beetle with a sunroof, seat warmers, cd with all the bells and whistles with an all black leather interior.
I love it and I could never hate my beetle, I bought my first beetle back in 1960 and I kept it for 20 years,it's still on the road being driven by my friend who just had to buy it from me.
My new beetle is awesome to drive, it handles like a Porsche and it's not for wimps to drive.
The Americans that remember back when you could buy a Beetle for $900.00 in 1960 and barely climb up a hill with the putt-putt air-cooled engine in the rear can now forget about that period, because now I easily can reach up to 135 mph as I climb over the Sierra's on my way to San Francisco or Los Angeles.
If you want to have fun, all of you should consider buying this outstanding vehicle.
