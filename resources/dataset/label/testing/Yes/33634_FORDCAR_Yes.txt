            Okay, that's just what my daughter says, &quot;vroom, vroom.&quot;  Well, I must agree.  This car has quite a bit of power.  I was 5 months pregnant when we bought this in December of '97.  We were pretty excited to have a brand new 1998 model.  Ours is Silver with light grey interior and its the sports edition.  This is a great car for someone who likes a reliable, economic, attractive, close-spaced automobile.  It is pretty low to the ground, but that is really all I'm used to so it doesn't bother me.  

Perks to this car, at least on ours, are the electric locks and windows, keyless remote, air bags, and the back seats go down for access to the trunk.  What I don't like about it is that you can't open the trunk from the inside without taking the keys out of the ignition and then popping with your remote.  I also don't like the windows because there is absolutely no tinting - not even the top 3 inches of the windshield.  That is going to have to be our next project for our annual 17 hour drive to West Virginia.  

All-around it is a nice car.  It gets 25 miles to the gallon and it handles beautifully.  It gets us where we need to go and what is most important?  Its CUTE!!<br><br>
