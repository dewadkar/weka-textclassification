            Some people say that it's a bad thing that this camera comes bare-bones, that you have to purchase all the attachments separately.  In reality, other than the limitations of Sony proprietary, this is actually the best value for the customer because it allows you to choose.

If this camera came with an adapter, a rechargable battery pack, a bigger memory stick, etc., the whole thing would have cost more than $300.  Instead, I paid $100 for the unit and cables.  I then purchased a Sandisk 128MB memory stick for $49.99 (holds 400 photos at highest setting), a leather case and 4 rechargable batteries plus super-quick charger ($30).  The batteries, by the way, lasts two days each pair, of frequent use with screen always on and flash.
When one pair runs out, the other pair of batteries are ready.  It takes 4 hours for a full charge - half the time of any regular Sony battery pack.

The photos are incredible, especially if you're used to SLR quality.  The zoom works well and is not at all grainy.  All the colors are beautifully captured.  The slow shutter provides astounding images.  I took a "ghost" picture of my friends (you can see what's behind them through them, like they are ghosts) by toying with the aperature.  The picture came out especially well because the red taillights of a car driving by turned into solid neon lines using the slow capture.  Don't let the fact that it is only a 1.3 Megapixel throw you off about its high quality.  Higher pixels generally mean bigger pictures and a lot of scrolling to see the whole thing on your computer screen.  This is useless because you basically throw away detail and anything gained by the extra megapixels when you reduce the photo to fit the screen (unless you have "Fireworks" software).  A 5 megapixel camera takes the same quality photo as my 1.3 MP camera at 1024-768 dpi, which is the setting most of us have on our computers.

For $200 overall, I got a camera with the picture quality, capacity, features, and battery life equivalent to $600 3.0 megapixel camera.    
GO buy it.  It's addictive.
