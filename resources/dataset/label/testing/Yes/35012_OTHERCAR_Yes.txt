            The only thing I can complain about is that the truck is very bouncy.  The springs are way too stiff and cause the truck to bounce excessively after going over a speed bump.  Going over a pot hole allows the shocks to work fine and therefore no bounce.   I half expect the shocks to compensate for the bouncy effect going over bumps in the road; however, this is not the case.  Also the truck does have some road vibration (springs again cause some bounce).  This is subsiding as the springs get broken in.  Expect to drive the truck for 2 to 3 years before the ride gets perfect.  

I have the LT package that comes with leather and on-star.  I love the leather.  I do not use the on-star.  The truck is very comfortable and roomy.  Great design and easy on the eyes.  The seats are heated and have lumbar support.  The back seats fold down so that you can load boxes and in my case a dog cage.  The driver has two seat position memory, I use is to move the chair forward for cleaning and lowering the back seat then I quickly put the driver seat back to the position I use for driving.  The stereo is very good and the speaker system is much better this time around.  There are reading lamps and the air condition vents work better this time around too.

Did I say I love the leather?
