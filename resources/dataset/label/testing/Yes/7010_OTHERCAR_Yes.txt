            I love them Land Cruisers. Yeah, I know that I trashed the 2000 LC, but it isn't used off-road any more.

The '80 to '89 Land Cruiser wagons are the best family 4WD around. Super strong, super durable and fun to drive. The straight 6 dishes out the torque for all kinds of fun. The engine is smooth and reliable. The interior is handsome and roomy. Everything is easy to use and to read. The wagon provides tons of room for everything, even the kitchen sink. The 4WD is flawless and ultra strong. The truck could climb a tree.

Also, the Land Cruiser is super safe. The vehicle has moderate height so that it can drive over big obstacles but it won't flip over in a hard turn. The truck sits on a super strong frame that extends from the front bumper to the rear bumper, unlike others that have the radiator and front end sitting out in front of the chasis.

This is another go anywhere, do anything vehicle that won't price you out of you families fortune.
