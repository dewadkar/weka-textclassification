             I personally purchased a 300Z because I have always been in love with it's  Body Design! Although this isn't considered very practical in the purchasing of a car but, If your in the market for a sports car you aren't very practical any ways!!!
 This car is a beauty, and the engine compliments this well! You'll have all the speed you'll ever need! All this while in the comfort of leather seats!
 Now that Nissan has discontinued this car, you can pick these up at a decent price! If you are purchasing a 300z over 100,000 mile or there about. You may want to consider that the Turbo's tend to give at around 115,000! This is a costly replacement! Another costly replacement is the suspension. This also seems to need replacing shortly after 100,000. 
 You may want to consider skipping the twin turbo all together! The basic  Z has plenty of power, sells for much less, and saves the headache of replacing the turbo later! 
 If having the Twin Turbo feature is that important to you still, you can always order a Twin Turbo emblem from any detail shop! With this, due to the impressive performance of the Basic engine. I assure you that nobody will ever know that your vehicle is not actually a Twin Turbo as advertised!<br><br>
