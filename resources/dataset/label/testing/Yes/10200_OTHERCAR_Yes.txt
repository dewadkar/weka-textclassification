            My 1991 Suzuki Swift hatchback was a hand me down from my father who drove it for 140,000 miles.  He has NEVER had a problem with it.  It has never been in a mechanics shop for any repairs.  When i got it i put 20,000 more miles of very hard driving and i never had a problem with it.  Recently, I had an accident where i hit the front right side of my car.  All i needed to fix was the hood, a head light, a blinker and the top part of the bumper.  I did all the work myself and the car is still running perfectly.  There is no shaking, no funny sounds, and nothing rattels.  When i first got this car i hated it because it is an egg looking thing on wheels but after having to drive it for 2 years now i like it.  It's been very loyal to me and has saved me alot of money on gas.  It has never left me stranded and it has always started.  I am always confident in this car.  I recommend it to anyone who isn't too worried about picking up women.<br><br>
