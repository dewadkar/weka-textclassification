            On <b>Epinion�s</b>, I like to write about a broad range of topics. I try to cover all the bases like, movies, video games, music, Internet servers, computers I even wrote a review about a vacuum. This is another first for me. This is my first car review. This is mainly because I did not even get my learners permit yet. I recently went to my dads house in <b>Virginia</b>. He recently bought a new car. This was the <b>2000 Chevrolet Tracker</b>. At first I was skeptical because my friend has had several SUV�s and I thought that I saw them all. The Tracker from what I saw was a stylish and smooth ride. Bear with me as I write�<b>My first car review</b>

<b>2000 Chevrolet Tracker</b>

If you live anywhere in Virginia, chances are, you might have to drive a lot. My dad had a <b>1998 Ford Taurus</b> and he was not happy with it. He said that it was not for him.  A year past and he decided to buy a new car. He traded in his Taurus towards this new Tracker. When he picked me up from the airport last Tuesday night, I was amazed at how smoothed it drove and how quiet it ran. After being a passenger of my mom�s Taurus my whole life, it was nice to sit higher than normal because it was an SUV. I felt a feeling of power. Anyway, we drove for about twenty minutes and we were home. I was happy that my dad bought a car that he liked. He kept saying that he loved the car. 

I know that my dad did not get any extra features with the car. The basic roll them up yourself windows and a tape player. My dad listens to the radio so there was no need to put in a CD player. If you are someone that likes loud surround sound in your car, than you will love this sound system. It is almost the perfect balance of sound with a smooth sounding tape player. The bass is amazing for a car. You could mistake yourself for thinking that you were in a dance club or something.

I did sit in the backseat. I really was not too satisfied with it. I found it to be very cramped. Also, since it is a fairly small SUV, it is hard to lay down in the backseat as well. Surprisingly enough, this was the biggest flaw that I found in this vehicle. 

From the outside, this car looks stylish and tells the world that you are in the mainstream. SUV�s are a lot of controversy these days with wreck less driving, but when you�re in the front seat, it is driving heaven. The mileage is great for and SUV. It makes a little over 18 miles per gallon. 

Want to see what this vehicle excels in? Lets see how the <b>2000 Chevrolet Tracker</b> stacks up. Ratings are from one to five stars.

<b>Here�s The Breakdown</b>

<b>Comfort</b>
<b>****</b>

Ok, if you are a single driver that does not usually have backseat riders, this is your car to drive. With seats that as cushioned for maximum comfort, it is hard to leave your car. Even though the front seat is perfectly fit, the backseat might be a problem. If I rated the front seats by themselves, I would give it five stars. If I rated the backseats by themselves, I would give it three stars. I put them together and get four stars. Don�t worry, like I said, if you don�t have any passengers on board, this is a smooth and luxurious drive.

-------------------------------------------

<b>Ride</b>
<b>*****</b>

Sure it may look pretty, but how is the ride? The ride is excellent. I have road up hills, highways, side streets, and sharp turns with this car and I have to say that I was shocked by how smooth it ran. Don�t worry about the snow that will come in the winter because this vehicle has 4X drive. This is a huge plus because this could save you money. You will never have to call <b>AAA</b> to get your car towed. This ride is comfortable.


-------------------------------------------

<b>Overall</b>
<b>****</b>

This car costs a little more than a <b>KIA Sportage</b>. I�m sure you know that the KIA is a very affordable car, but when it gets into a crash, you can kiss your frame good bye. This car has a better safety record, and drives better. This car can range from <b>$10,000- $15,000</b>. I think my dads without the extra features were about $10,000. My dad�s tracker is black, and he enjoys it every time he drives it. It also looks beautiful from the outside. For any SUV owner and has the needs for a comfortable, affordable four-wheel drive vehicle, please test-drive the <b>2000 Chevrolet Tracker</b> today. 

<b>Features</b>:
<b>4 Wheel Drive</b>
<b>Power Windows</b> (Optional)
<b>Power Breaks</b>
<b>Power Steering</b>
<b>Keyless Entry</b> (Optional)
<b>Power Door locks</b> (Optional)
<b>CD Player</b> (Optional)

<b>Bottom Line:</b> Great price, great car.
