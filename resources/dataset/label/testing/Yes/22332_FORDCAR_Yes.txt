            Room and comfort are the main reasons I purchased this vehicle. There's space in the cabin to seat 5 adults comfortably.The third row seats are better suited to children due to the seat height. I've taken a couple of
long trips (500+ miles) and was pleasantly surprised by the car like ride
and handling. Body roll in turns is minimal, very little road noise and the air suspension helps to smooth out ride as well. The exterior trim
and fit are good and the color very attractive (white). Body
styling is very aerodynamic compared to other full size S.U.V.'s. The interior
is very well appointed and ergonomic. All the gages and convenience
item function properly. The windows are huge and allow for excellent
viewing. The engine (5.4L) is adequate for a vehicle this size but a few more ponies would be better. Gas mileage isn't the greatest(ave. 13)
but if your going to buy a truck this size, it shouldn't even be considered. If it is, this vehicle isn't for you. I also like the radio
antenna hidden in the side window. One less opportunity for vandalism.
The third row seat is easily removed but it's heavy and really needs
2 people to handle it. Some people have criticized the manufacturer for 
covering the third row seat with vinal instead of leather when the leather
seat option is chosen. But when you think about it, vinal is a good choice
because the seat may be removed and children will most likely occupy
them most of the time and vinal is easier to clean and less expensive
to replace.
As it may appear, I'm very happy with my Expedition and I'm sure
you will be to. 4/19/00-6000 miles later and it's still going strong.
Added an Airaid induction system and it improved gas mileage by 2. Going
to install a throttle body spacer to increase torque and get some low end power and perhaps another increase in gas mileage. I'm really enjoying
my Expedition and hope you are too.<br><br>
