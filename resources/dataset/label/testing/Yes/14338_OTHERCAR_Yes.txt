            We recently traded our 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited in on a 2000 Nissan Altima GXE.  Having a child, we wanted to do our part to make the world a little better place by getting rid of the SUV and going with something a little �greener� while not giving up totally on all the luxuries.  We have only had the Nissan a couple of weeks so this review might be updated from time to time if my opinion changes or I learn some new feature that I feel is worth mentioning.  :)

Let me start by saying we checked out a large number of makes and models and finally settled on the Altima for a number of reasons:

1) Mileage � 21 city and 28 highway far surpassed our Jeep.  This is in the middle of the range for its compact class (15 � 42 city and 21 � 49 hwy). The gastank is 15.9 gallons. On our first fill up, we averaged 20.19 mpg for mostly city driving with one trip of ~ 70 miles.  We went approximately 225 miles and still had � tank left.
2) Emissions � the Altima at least matches the national average for vehicle emissions (3) and depending on where it is built can actually be twice as good on the environment (6).
3) Brand confidence � of all the Nissan owners we talked to, we couldn�t find a single one that disliked their own vehicle(s) or had had any major problems with them regardless of age.
4) Price � since this was a 2000 model and it�s year-end clearance time, we managed to cut over $5,000 off the asking price and got a great financing rate!
5) Equipment � the list of standard equipment on the GXE is rather substantial.  More and more vehicles are offering CD players as standard fair but this one also included a 6-disc CD jukebox in the trunk that doesn�t interfere with the single player in the dash.  See more about equipment below.

Some of the features you will find on the GXE include: dual �2nd Gen� airbags, cruise, power windows, door locks and mirrors, remote keyless entry, intermittent wipers, liquid-filled engine mounts, and CFC A/C. It also has a 60/40 fold-down rear seat, in glass antennae, twin front map lights, 2 cur holders in the front and one in the back, and drivers seat lifters for a custom feel.

Some of the little luxuries that this car has include: sun visor extensions, a middle rear seat armrest, a power point on the dash and one in the center console, driver�s window automatic down, an overhead sunglasses case, and seat back map pockets.  

I like the fact then when you turn off the car and open the door the inside light doesn�t immediately blind you but begins as a soft glow increasing in intensity until it is full strength.  Another feature I like is there are an additional set of lights on the front on either side of the car.  Only the light on the side you are turning towards comes on and only when you use your directional. Their sole purpose is to help illuminate exactly where you are turning to prevent hitting curbs/objects that could be obscured in the dark.  Little touches like this tell me that the designers really thought about this car before they built it. 

There are also 2 separate compartments in the center console; a lower section structured to hold 6 CD cases and a small upper section for loose items.  Near the shifter, there is a small molded place for coins but like most non-smokers, we�ll use the ashtray for loose change. 

The keyless entry allows you to open only the driver�s door or all doors as well as just the trunk.

The class-leading 155 HP 2.4L 16-valve DOHC engine has plenty of �get up and go�.  As of yet, I�ve never experienced a sluggish takeoff or acceleration when I needed it.  It is easily capable of maintaining speed while the cruise is engaged regardless of the terrain.  Here in central Kentucky the roads are more like a roller coaster than a salt flat and I�ve never felt as if the engine was straining to keep up with me.

The ride is reasonably quiet which surprised me for a compact.  Most vehicles that we test drove had as much outside noise regardless of whether the windows were up or down

The only thing that I have noticed to date is that you have a tendency to feel every major and some minor bumps in the road. Accepting this as a part of the �compact� class, this is a very comfortable ride.  Although we haven�t driven for extremely long periods yet, the seats are extremely comfortable for an hour or two.  In fact, my wife claims she has more leg room in the Altima then she did in the Jeep. As I�ve said before, I�m not a small guy but I have plenty of room in this vehicle without having to move the seat all the way back.  At 6� plus, I also have plenty of head space (39.4�) and shoulder room (55.7�).  I�m not sure we�d be brave enough to try to place 3 grown people in the back seat but it�s perfect for our daughter and the assortment of things she brings along when we travel.

Overall vehicle dimensions are: wheelbase 103.1, length 185.8, width 69.1, height 55.9. This vehicle sits very close to the ground and was quite a change from the Jeep but I�m getting used to getting up and out instead of sliding down and out.

Interior passenger space is 94 cu. Ft with an additional 13.8 cu. Ft for cargo.
 
Overall, the entire family is happy with the car and unlike the story of Goldilocks and the three bears, everyone is comfortable in any seat.
