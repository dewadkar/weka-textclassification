            I've owned this Volvo for several years now. My mother owned it before I did. This car has to be the most reliable machine on earth. I cannot say I haven't spent my share of money on repairs. This car is 14 years old and now has almost 252,000 miles on it. I can say though, the repairs have been normal maintenance and minor repairs; nothing serious. BUT, parts and service are very expensive. It is also very hard to find someone willing to work on these cars. Honestly, I don't see why, I've done plenty of my own work on the car without a problem. another thing to aware of is the brakes. They work well, but wear quickly. I usually go through front pads every 4-5 months (at $120.00, every time). Also, the rotors cannot be turned, meaning, they cannot be &quot;sanded&quot; down. These rotors are very tough (I've had the same ones for 250,000 miles), but they will begin to wear eventually. The car is very comfortable, even for long trips. Engine is noisy, and you get a good amount of wind noise in the cabin. Many people say they are ugly cars. However, I've met tons of people that can only compliment me on mine...They always say it looks very classy. The power is decent, the 2.3 liter engine delivers about 114hp. I'd like a little more power, but I can't complain too much. The gas MPG is tolerable...mine seems to be getting worse as the years progress. All in all...this is a magnificent car. When I get out of college, and make some money, I plan on buying a new one. 
If you're interested in buying one, take it to someone you trust and get it checked out. It will save you a lot of time and money in the long run. Good Luck!<br><br>
