            My parents purchased their Cutlass Ciera from our local dealership in 1993.  Since then, it has had only 2 problems during our entire 8 year ownership.  It has over 160,000 miles on her and she can still beat everyone else at the stoplights.  Her 3300 V6 is adequately powerful, with plenty of power off the line.  The only problems we have had are: The alternator belt broke while on vacation in St. Cloud, MN, and the alternator stopped charging on our way to Mayville, ND, to move my brother into college.  Her paint shines radiantly, her engine purrs effortlessly, and she never fails to start, no matter what the temperature, be it -30 or 100.  She definitely outlasted our expectations, and my parents refuse to sell it because they love it so much and because it is such a good car.  If you ever get the opportunity, buy this car immediately.  You will never regret it.
