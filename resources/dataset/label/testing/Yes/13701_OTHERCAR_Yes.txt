            This vehicle is by far one of the nicest cars out there, they are great with there handling and have alot of power when you drive them,There dynamic look gives it a trendy type of outlook on having one. you can get many girls with a car like this :). I drove a  rent a car in cali that was a mazda 626, and i almost fell asleep driving, thats the way this car handles and all while it contains as much power as any other car. If you do not own  a mazda  626 please go out and by one.<br><br>
