            I have already written a review on a '86 Mazda B2200 Cab-Plus, but now it's time to write about the truck that replaced my fathers old truck (B2200), and bestowed it upon me.

We needed to get another vehicle since I was an up and coming driver, so my dad very pleased with his old mazda, bought a '89 B2000 with 105k on it.  I asked if he thought that was a lot, but he quickly denied it for it was a Mazda, those things run forever, he said.  And he was right!

He bought a '89 B2000 that was BONE STOCK...  The guy who bought it new didn't even get a radio in it, that's how stock it was.  No matter, though.  Mazda isn't really renowned for it's superior audio, in trucks, anyways.  It had the 4 cyl., 5 spd., like every other Mazda out there, and it ran great.  Still does.

Last Summer, we had severe flooding and thunderstorms in our area (Central PA), and my dad had to make an emergency trip to work, because the storm took out some transformers, or something, and since my Dad is an electrician at a large factory, he was called in.  On the way there, there was LOTS of flooding, most of it in places you wouldn't expect.  The little Mazda got into water up to the hood, and my dad quickly evacuated, waiting on a nearby porch for the water to recede.  It did, and my dad climbed in his Mazda Submarine, and drove away.  Of course it was driving like a pile of junk, water got in the oil, but a quick change of oil, and it was back to new....  Except for the water lines inside the cab, and lot's of junk stuck in strange places.  

It's still up and running strong a year later.  No major repairs other than exhaust, and brakes.  Great truck, I wish I still had mine!  Any vehicle that survives a flood with flying colors deserves to be in everyone's garage!<br><br>
