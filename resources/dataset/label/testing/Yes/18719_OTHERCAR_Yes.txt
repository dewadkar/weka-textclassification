            About 6 months ago my husband and I bought a used Buick Park Avenue.  We had wanted a car that would get us across the country on our vacation.  The Park Avenue was offered to us by the car salesman because it fit our needs.  We really hadn't been looking for that make of car specifically--the price was what led us to it.  

A couple of weeks after we had purchased it I was driving it on a busy 4-lane road and the car in front of me stopped to wait for oncoming traffic in order to make a left-hand turn.  I managed to stop without hitting her but as I looked in my rear-view mirror I realized that the car behind me had no idea that I was stopped and was going to hit me.  It was a small car--brand new.  I can't remember the make.  He hit me going at least 30 miles an hour, and knocked me into the car ahead of me.  As I sat in my car trying to get my wits about me I dreaded what my &quot;new&quot; car was going to look like.  The car ahead of me--a mid-sized Ford--had a nicely dented bumper.  The car behind me was totaled.  The hood was buckled back nearly to the windshield, the air bags had come out, the radiator was leaking and the car was badly damaged and had to be towed away.  

As soon as I realized that I was OK--not hurt at all--I got out of my car to inspect the damage.  To my surprise, I couldn't see any obvious damage.  My fenders were intact--no bumps or scrapes.  The front bumper was slightly dented and the back bumper was obviously pushed up under the car a bit.  But the car was not badly damaged and I was able to drive it with no problem.  There were people milling about.  We were in front of a house where about 6 or 7 people were playing or talking on the lawn and had witnessed the accident.  They came over to me to make sure I was OK and all expressed amazement at how well my car had taken the impact, as did the officers who came to write the accident report.  The lady in the car ahead of mine said, &quot;My husband and I were planning to buy a Saturn but I think we may be changing our minds and buying a Buick Park Avenue!&quot;

We took the car to have the damage checked.  They estimated that it would cost about $3000 to have the fender and trunk fixed.  Since we could tell no difference in driving the car and the look of the car had not been altered, we elected to take the $3000 and apply it to our loan.  

We were able to drive the car (a month later) from Arkansas to Washington State, down to California, and back to Arkansas without the slightest problem.  I'm still amazed, and would recommend without hesitation that if you want a good, safe, dependable car, buy a Buick Park Avenue!  It's great!<br><br>
