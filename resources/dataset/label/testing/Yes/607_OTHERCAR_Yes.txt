            We were in need of a car as our old one got totalled and I didnt want to spend a whole lot of money on one.  We wanted something reliable and inexpensive.  We came across the Nissan Sentra GXE and took it for a test drive.  We fell in love with it.  My husband is 6'3&quot; and has problems with a lot of the smaller cars because even with the rear seat back all the way, his knees hit the dashboard.  He was actually very comfortable in this car, and we still have room to put the carseats in the backseat.

Now that we purchased the vehicle, I keep forgetting that it is a 1996!  It rides so much better than some of the brand new cars I have owned!  I absolutely love this car!  Going used meant we could get the options that I love, such as automatic transmission, power windows and doors, keyless entry, and not break the checking account with bank payments.

The trunk is also very roomy, and with a toddler and a new baby coming along, that is definitely something we needed to consider!

I would definitely tell anyone to test drive a Nissan!<br><br>
