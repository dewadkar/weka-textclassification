            When I was shopping for a car last year I queried several mechanics as to what I should consider - I informed them my husband and I aren't "car people," we don't do too many of our own repairs, we don't like extensive upkeep and we don't always even change the oil when we're supposed to.  Upon short reflection, each mechanic gave me virtually the same answer:  "A Toyota is the best car for you to abuse!"

So, I set my sites on the Toyota Rav4.  Being a stay-at-home rural mom who's never owned a car that wasn't a stick shift, and whose last vehicle for the past 12 years was a '78 Volvo wagon, I decided I wanted to go with a vehicle that not only was fun to drive, but which looked "cool," and was easy to drive (ie:  AUTOMATIC!).  In my area, used Rav4s are kind of tough to come by, and I didn't want new, so I set about researching the stock at fairly local car dealerships.  I found the one I wanted in Portland, Oregon (roughly 100 miles from my home) and purchased it.  Mine is a vibrant sky-blue, front-wheel drive number with "fancy" wheels.  

The Rav4 IS fun to drive, people look at it with a "isn't that a cute little number" bemusement, and my friends all say "it's zippy, just like you."  Zippiness aside, my Rav4 gets decent gas mileage (20-24 mpg), handles well (except at high speeds on tight corners), and has pretty good "pick up."  The overdrive feature is a pretty nice gas saver (you DO sacrifice some pick up), but I often forget to use it on freeway driving.  Mine is equipped with cruise control which I enjoy.  The ride is pretty smooth for an SUV, and I like sitting up a little higher than you do in an average car.  The systems seem to work pretty well, the heater heats and the air conditioner cools - and pretty fast!  It doesn't take long to defrost the windows, but I had a problem this winter with the doors freezing shut overnight, then when I finally got them open and tried to drive, the doors wouldn't shut (they were frozen open!!) until things warmed up (heater on full-blast for 10 minutes).  I don't know if this is pandemic, or just a peculularity of my particular vehicle.  I enjoy the way the back end opens side-to-side, and I keep a couple of plastic crates in the rear end to haul groceries, but I could use a little more storage.  Since the back end is "open to the world," like a station wagon, I purchased the "boot" which hides cargo and I enjoy being able to have that security. My son likes the rear seats which you can fold all the way back if you like.  I wasn't really crazy about the blue/gray/hot pink melange seat upholstery color combination, but that's a small price to pay if you really like your car otherwise. 

I have had my Rav4 for over a year and have been generally pleased with the comfort, performance, durability and style.  My husband (who's quite a bit taller than me) even drives it frequently and, for a small vehicle, the Rav4 provides plenty of head and leg room even for him.   I basically consider my Rav4 to be an "amped-up" version of a medium-sized car, with mostly car amenities in an SUV package.
