            I recently had the chance to drive the 2002 7 Series during a BMW event sponsored by the Komen foundation for breast cancer.  I highly suggest this event as it does raise money and awareness for a good cause, all while getting to drive in BMW's.

Much press has been given to this car, and most of it has been negative.  I'm going to try and separate the hype from the reality.

First, let's tackle the styling, the most controversial part of the car.  BMW's in general are not leaders in the style department, although they do have a nice, clean design to them.  For the front 2/3's of this car, it follows the same cleanliness.  While people may not be too enthused about this part of the car, it is more sporty looking than a Mercedes S-Class, although not nearly as elegant.  It also give an impression of being "big," whereas the S-Class sometimes looks small.  In a luxury sedan such as this, you want to be big.  Where the design falls apart is the hind 1/3 of the car.  A strange trunk, and a weird arrangement of lights in the back make you wonder what they were thinking.  While it continues the "big" appeal, it just doesn't look too good.  BMW's have always been known for quirky styling, so this may help them in the long run.  Too early to tell.  But, it is on a lot of people's minds, and takes away from what is a great drivers car.

Interior wise, it is better than the old 7.  A lot more wood (including a matte or optional gloss finish) all throughout helps out.  A mix of some very high quality components and some cheap ones are abound.  In the test car that I was driving, the actual dash and doors feeled extremely solid and put together.  But, a piece of the wood in front of the gauges had popped up, with only about a 100 miles on the odometer.  This type of good/bad continues throughout the interior.  One thing they finally got right was the cup holders.  German cars are notorious for having the worlds worst cup holders, and it is nice to see a simple, useful design in one.  Room is good, and I expect the longer wheelbase version to be much better for rear seat occupants.  Most people should be able to find a comfortable seating position, even though the drivers side dash does hug you quite a bit, but not as much as in some other BMW's.

Controls for major functions are not bad, but not great either.  More on the iDrive system in a bit, but they were smart enough to keep the most vital climate controls as switches and buttons on the dash.  I wish they had kept more for the radio controls, though, as it is basically either the steering wheel controls, or the iDrive system.

The first thing that you will notice upon entering the car is the different way in which you need to do certain vital functions.  Everything is electronically controlled.  While I feel that this is the way that all cars will be in the future, it may be too much, too soon.  Even after having read up on it extensively before driving it, they had specialists in the 7 that were showing people how to get going.  It is a process of many button presses and lever pulls.  I think that the totally electronic column shifter will take some time to get used to.  Also, the stalks for the shifter and turn signals are about an inch too short, making them a little bit hard to use.

Once you finally get moving, driving is much like it is an any other car.  Options too countless to list exist buried in the iDrive system.

Now, about that iDrive system.  It is good and bad.  Certainly, it needs work before it is truly useful.  As a person that works with computers very well, I found it a little bit difficult to use.  If you are working on a function in say the Navigation system, you can not easily switch to another channel or track on a CD (which thankfully, the CD changer is in the center armrest).  The iDrive round knob controller gives you feedback so that it is a smart controller, but I could not easily operate it without taking my eyes off the road for too long.  And since BMW is the "Ultimate Driving Machine," this kind of goes against that mantra, and may be the "Ultimate Crashing Machine" if 7 series owners do not understand the system well.  Although, allowing access to the myriad options has to be done somehow.  But, I think that more of the major systems are going to have to revert back to a more standard setup, and put the more obscure or Navigation related options in to the iDrive system.

The car IS more friendly overall than previous 7 series models.  More storage space inside, including several drawers for stuff in the middle console (although they are too small).  And as I mentioned the useful cup holders.  The leather seats were comfortable.  Interior noise is subdued, but allows for you to hear the silky V8 in all its splendor.

Through all that is bad or not very well received about the car, what redeems this car is the overall driving characteristics of the car.  This car was equipped with the sports package, so it had big 19-inch wheels with Pirelli P-Zero tires (the same that are used on exotic sports cars).  Indeed, this car likes to drive.  Although it is a big car, you don't feel.  It handles almost as well as the 3 series.  Partial credit to the tires and wheels, but the dynamics are excellent.  Limited body roll in turns.  Crisp and responsive on a any surface.  Seems glued to the road.  Steering was mostly crisp, but lacked feel, and was WAY too light, unlike any BMW I have ever driven.  The engine is incredible.  A sweet exhaust note, and a virtually effortless buildup of power will have you doing triple digit speeds in no time.  It is not as smooth as it should be, but the performance side of it makes up for that.  Ride was controlled and not busy, but on the firm side.  Some bumps will jar the ride somewhat, but does ride awfully nice considering the huge tires (standard 7 Series get 18 inch tires).  Still, it is not Lexus smooth.  If all the car had to do was drive, you'd be in heaven.

So the final verdict on this car:  It needs some work before it is ready for the big leagues.  The car has an impressive array of features in it that set the standard for the next generation of cars, and sets in motion the complete "drive by wire" transformation that will occur in the future.  It is also a tremendous improvement over the previous 7.  While the handling was already superb in the older model, this one is even better.  It is also more luxurious than previous models.

Where it fails is in the iDrive system and the conflicted styling.  iDrive is something that is way to difficult to use, and is not even necessary for some of the functions that they use it for.  And the styling is so strange, and not really all that elegant.  If these two things are enough to do the car in, it is really to hard to tell.  This is the car that I want to love because it is such a great car, but skimps on some of the other things that make a great car great.  If you look at other offerings of BMW, such as the Mini Cooper, and the new, as yet unreleased Rolls Royce (which BMW will own in 2003) and the Range Rover (which BMW did own and designed most of the car), you can see that BMW can accomplish good styling.  But the vital models in their lineup are becoming unusual looking, which is not a great thing.
