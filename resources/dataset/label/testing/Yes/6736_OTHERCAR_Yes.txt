              The 3rd generation (1986-1989) is one of the best used car buys that one could ever make.  Honda is known for reliable and excellent-performing automobiles.
  I own a 1988 Honda Accord DX with automatic transmission.  I purchased it used for $3500 in May of 1998 with 98,000 miles on the odometer .  It has been an excellent vehicle!!  The only thing that broke on it was the alternator (in feb. 1999).  In September 2000, I got a full mechanical inspection on my Accord.  Everything was fine.  The only recommended preventative maintenance was to replace upper control arms (above the rear tires).  This type of repair is fairly common for 3rd generation Accords, with the rear upper control arms often being replaced with 100,000 - 140,000 miles on the odometer.  Mine currently has 111,000 miles.  As long as you perform routine maintenance like oil and fluid changes, then major problems (like transmission and engine troubles) won't occur until the car is WELL beyond 100,000 miles.  Many Accords have gone for 200,000, 300,000, even 400,000 miles without any transmission or engine problems.  Just look at some of the other Epinions on Honda Accords for proof.
    My 1988 Accord DX is good, basic transportation.  It has a 98 horsepower 2.0 liter carbureted engine that supplies plenty of power.  For everyday driving, this engine is good, however, acceleration can seem weak if you floor the accelerator.  The engine runs at 3000 RPM at about 70mph, which is higher than when compared to today's newest cars.  This was because the engine and transmission were timed for highway speed limits that were generally lower than what they are today.  Comfort is good for short trips.  Longer trips of more than 2 hours can be somewhat uncomfortable, but are tolerable.  Dashboard instrument displays are perfectly arranged.  They look stylish for a car of this age.  The heating system works well.  Air conditioning was optional in the DX version (mine has it, but unfortunately it leaks). DX Accords have manual windows, locks, and a single side mirror on the drivers side.
  The LX version of the 1986-1989 Accord is about the same as DX Accord.  It has the same engine, but adds 2 power mirrors, locks, and windows.  The rear seat can fold down.
  The LX-i version of the 1986-1989 Accord is the top of the line.  It has everything that the LX version has except it comes with a 110hp (1986-1987) or 120hp(1988-1989) fuel injected engine which supplies faster acceleration than the 98hp engine.  Fuel economy is only a couple MPG less with the LX-i engine.  As an option, many LX-i Accords have a factory moonroof.  Alloy wheels are standard.
  For 1989, a special Accord SE-i was produced.  It has all the features of the LX-i version as well as:  Honda-Bose sound system, steering wheel audio controls, leather seats, standard factory moonroof, and 4 wheel disc brakes.
  Any Accord from 1986 to 1989 would make a fine choice as a used car for a teenage/college age driver or as a commute vehicle.  They are very reliable, perform well, get about 25-30 mpg (for the 98hp carbureted engine, slightly less for the 110hp or 120hp fuel injected LX-i or SE-i engine) in mixed city and highway driving, and look sporty with their aerodynamic design and pop-up headlights.  You can't go wrong with this car.  Many good quality Accords of this age are for sale from private owners and dealership trade-ins.  Overall, they are great cars!<br><br>
