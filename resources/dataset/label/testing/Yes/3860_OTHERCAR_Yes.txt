            IF you take a look at the car and truck that ford and chevy have put out in the last 10 years you will see where ford has never been every to pass the great yukon.  Chevy has always made a better truck than ford.  Now the new GMC is in a class all by it self.  I feel that ford we never be able to make a truck that will keep up the yukon in a long time. One day ford will take a big step in taking the lead from chevy but until then chevy rules. CHEVY RULES CHEVY RULES CHEVY RULES CHEVY RULES CHEVY RULES THAT WHY I DRY A FORD EXPLORE. <br><br>
