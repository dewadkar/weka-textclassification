            I, as a student in high school who drives to school, know that a reliable and easy to use car is a good tool. The Honda Civic is perfect. With a simple but sporty look and stylish interior, the Civic can become your best friend.

I rarely have to maintain it, besides flat tires. Has good fuel economy for medium to light drivers, perfect for the suburbs. If you are a parent looking for a car for the new driver in your family, I suggest a new or used Honda. He/She will love it for it's stereo and look, the parent can love it for it's safety and reliability. 

The Civic is a practical car for a good and fair price. I can't count the times that it's held up in storms so well and with potholes. Though the manufacturer was a little skimpy on some of the interior parts, such as the over-use of breakable plastic on the dashboard and doors, the EX version helps the user overlook minor details. Driving is somewhat smooth, mostly average. Overall a good buy for new drivers and/or parents.<br><br>
