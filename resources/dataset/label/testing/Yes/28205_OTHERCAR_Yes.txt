            Author's Note:  This review updated and revised April 4, 2000


I knew the relationship was heading in the right direction when my girlfriend (now fiancee')and I both agreed we wouldn't get caught dead in a van. The alternative?  Obviously an SUV.  Next question:  which one?  After doing some extensive research on the web the obvious choice was the Dodge Durango. A test drive immediately demonstrated the superior power, ride, and features of this SUV as compared to other vehicles in its class - just as Chrysler advertises.

Between the two of us we have four kids and a collection of &quot;stuff&quot; to tote around so seating and interior room was at the top of the list of important features.  That eliminated many of the smaller sport utes like the Cherokee and Explorer. We also didn't want the vehicle to be a monstrosity to drive around town like some of the larger sport utilities out there. The Durango was perfect balance in this area as several 4 hour trips with the kids in tow have demonstrated. But keep in mind we went from squishing those Rugrats into the backseat of a Ford Escort to the Durango - a major difference!

With the optional third seat raised the kids each have their own space - not to mention cupholders - and behind the last seat is still room to pack luggage or groceries. However, we've determined that for long trips that demand hauling more stuff we're going to have to invest in a roof top carrier. A small price to pay for an SUV that one can easily whip around in a crowded parking lot.

Accessibility to this third seat area is dream.  Not only does the back support of the second row seat fold forward and down, but another maneuver allows you to also flip the posterior-supporting portion of the seat forward as well. Anyone climbing back to the third seat row doesn't have to do a half-ganor to get there. Returning the second seat row to the upright position is a short two-second, two step procedure. 

With the third seat row folded down the Durango can swallow just about any cargo you wish to haul. 

The Dodge doesn't drive like an SUV. Very car-like in handling and breaking. We opted for the Magnum 5.2 liter V8 engine - which essentially killed the gas mileage figures - but gave us the extra power that we wanted. Great for squirting across that busy intersection or weaseling your way into that gap in traffic.  

We also debated over getting a four-wheel verses the two-wheel drive version of the SUV. In the end it came down to dollars and just plain common sense. The 4WD was much more expensive and unless you plan to have to extricate yourself from a mud bog or 5 foot snow drifts - and we don't have either very often here in Oklahoma - then the two wheel drive version will serve your needs just fine. It's my understanding that it also requires less maintenance.

Interior amenities are not spartan but not luxurious either.  Essentially, you get what you pay for. The extra large side-view mirrors are a worthwhile safety feature. Power windows, locks, and a nice cassette stereo were also included.  You've also got two extra power outlets. One next to the cigarette lighter - great if you are say, charging your cell phone and listening to your portable CD player through the sound system - and another just behind the third row of seats. On long trips, the kids can plug in their TV/VCR unit into that one.   

We chose cloth seats - which proved rather difficult to find on this model vehicle. (Our past experience is that kids and leather don't get along very well.)  

Finally, shop around before you purchase your Durango. We found a several thousand dollar difference in price on nearly identical models between dealerships around town.  Listen carefully to the financing options as well.  

UPDATE: January 29,2000

We just had a ton of snow dumped in my home town....okay, okay, 6 inches IS a ton in Oklahoma! But anyway, the Durango was great in the slippery white stuff. Any sliding was easily corrected whether that was because I was taking a corner to quickly or tromping on the brakes. (It's called &quot;testing the performance envelope&quot; of the vehicle.) A much different experience than trying to navigate the slick roads in my 1999  TransAm!  

UPDATE: April 4, 2000

The Durango continues to be virtually bullet proof. A plastic piece in the rear air conditioning vent apparently snapped *points an accusing figure at the eleven year old* - but I suspect this will be covered by warranty on our next service visit to the dealer.

Gas mileage - especially in this retro 70s era of gas prices - makes one grit their teeth when filling up this vehicle. But the trade off is hauling two kids and a ton of groceries in comfort. We are also in the process of moving my fiancee'-turned-wife and her two boys into my house. I can't imagine doing so without filling up the capacious interior of the Durango. 

An astute Epinions member rightfully pointed out something I hadn't imagined - the Durango IS NOT a front wheel drive vehicle as I previously stated in this review.  Of course, this makes the excellent handling of the Durango in our winter snow dump even more impressive. 

(Now...I wonder if I could convince the wife to trade in her Durango for the limited edition hotrod Hennesey version?????)
