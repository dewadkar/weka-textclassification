            I come from a family of Jeep owners. My stepmom drives the Jeep Grand Wagoneer. My dad well he goes for the more spicy jeep he has a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and then there is my fiancee's sister who has a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport and then at the bottom of the list is me with my Cherokee sport 1989. I have had no troubles with this vehicle. I purchased it with 100,000 miles on it for 2500 dollars and let me tell you I have had it for 2 years with little to no trouble. I live in upstate ny and we get bombed with snow all the time but I get wherever I need to go. The Jeep rides smoothly and it handles great. I have been through many vehicles and none had the success that my jeep has. If I do have troubles I mainly get used parts and they come pretty cheap. There is alot of room under the hood which makes them easy to work on. I guess one of the only down falls which you will come acrossed in most 4*4 vehicles is the 4 wheel drive which can come costly at times. Luckily I have had no problems with mine yet.Also the paint on the Jeep is like brand new and the vehicle is 12 years old. I have decided that when it comes time to purchase a new vehicle that I will stick with the Jeep I mean 200,000 miles and still going like it is brand new now that tells me somthing.
