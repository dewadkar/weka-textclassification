            I have always dreamed of driving the ultimate machine and I just may have when i had the opportunity to drive the Acura NSX. Thi cae has a huge engine with quite a kick behind it.The NSX is available with a 3.0-liter DOHC 24-valve V-6 with 252 hp or a 3.2-liter DOHC 24-valve V-6 with 290 hp. It also has an option of a 6-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic(available only on the 3.0 liter engine). This car is rear wheel drive. With that little bit of information lets talk about the other amazing facts that the NSX has to offer.


Strengths: 
The Car has superior performance and handling, far superior then my current Acura Integra. The interior design is like a jet engine cockpit, the way Acura laid it out is very comfortable and class. I Enjoy the the engine sounds as well, its powerful yet not to droning on the ears. The heavy weight of the car and its 270 HP make this baby haul a**. This is a daily driver car for a person who has a need for speed. The main concern is the price, though the car has the capability of retaining its original value quite well.

Weaknesses: 
-Can't (don't) park it in busy parking lots where it could get dings from other car doors
-Can't (don't) drive it in snowy winter weather
- For the extremely high price, there a plethora of other cars that could be a better value for the consumer. I think this car is way overpriced at $84,000.

Review Summary: 
The car is locked and loaded, it just needs the right owner to set it free. I've envied all NSX owners for the past 9 years...and my wait has finally ended. It is an amazing car. Beautiful styling with astonishing performance and handling.If you can find a low mileage NSX at a normal price with no accident history, absolutely go for it. The NSX is the true definition of the term &quot;Ultimate Driving Machine&quot;.
