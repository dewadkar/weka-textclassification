            My 99 Civic EX is the third Honda I have purchased in the past several years, and it might be the best car (overall) that I've owned.  My previous Accords (88 and 91 models) performed absolutely flawlessly over the 80-90,000 miles I owned each of them, and my new Civic is shaping up to be just as great.  I currently have 36,000 miles on my Civic, and it has not required anything other than regular service.  More importantly, it still drives and feels like it did when it was new.  
Here are some of my specific likes:
1)The car handles very responsively AND delivers a fantastic ride.  I recently put 15 inch wheels/tires on to replace the 14's, and the difference is dramatic.  The original set up was fine, but I felt the wheels looked a bit small on the car...the 15's look grrreat and actually ride a bit nicer than the 14's, in spite of the 50-series tires on it.  Compared to my previous Accords', this car's ride/handling balance is superior.  
2) Quality (even on the US-built models) is first rate.  I buy Honda's because I will not tolerate poor quality products (ie: GM/Ford/Chrysler) and constant trips to the dealer...My &quot;domestic&quot; car purchases have all proven to be mistakes.  
3)  Gas mileage is good (30 city, 35 hwy) as long as I don't have my Yakima roof rack on top...when I load the roof up with my toys, gas mileage has dropped as low as 18mpg...that's not good when the gas tank is only 11.9 gallons. Still, it's better than any of your gas-hog SUV's.
4)  Price: I think the Civic's a good deal...I paid $17K for an EX 5 speed ...there's not much out there for $17K with this many features.
5)  Resale values on Civics are unbelievably high...I can't believe what 2 year old Civics are still getting in the marketplace. It's good to know I won't have trouble selling it.

Some dislikes:
1)  The car has virtually no torque; none, nada.  Around town, with no passengers or hills, you'll likely not notice.  But put a few friends inside and/or drive in the mountains, and you'll be gearing down and getting passed by grandma's Geo.  I'm learing to keep the engine screaming at 5,000 rpm's and up to stay in the power band, but I always feel guilty driving the car that hard.  At least it's a Honda, it can take it.
2)  That factory CD stereo is awful...it produces the weakest sound I've heard in a long time from a car stereo.  My previous Honda's had great factory systems, though, which makes me sad. 
3)  It's not a station wagon...I will be selling the car soon for no other reason than to get something with more space for my &quot;stuff.&quot;  People-room is great, especially considering the car's size, but there's just not a lot of room for my 3 dogs to ride along.<br><br>
