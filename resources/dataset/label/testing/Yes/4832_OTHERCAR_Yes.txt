            I have never seen so many heads turn.  Everywhere I drove this thing people gawked at it.  I would tend to agree that the Chrysler LHS is one amazing looking car.  This close cousin to the 300M blends luxury and sport in a way that has never been matched.  Test drive it once and just watch people admire the sleek LHS.

It doesn't stop with the looks.  The V6 engine in this car hauls.  A slight push on the gas and you're driven back into your seat.  The superior handling, great gas mileage, and incredible acceleration put LHS in a class by itself.

Inside, the comfortable leather seating, great sound system, easily accessible controls, and beautiful dash configuration add to the classiness of the Chrysler LHS.  

Sure, try Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, and Lincoln, but nowhere will you be able to get as much car for you're money as you will with the LHS. <br><br>
