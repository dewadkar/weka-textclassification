            I have an '86 with 2.9L V6 4WD Automatic and a camper shell (only 170K miles), and although the paint has chipped off in many places and the windshield wipers do not obey my commands, it still runs great.  I love driving up steep grades on Hwy. 101 near San Francisco and passing newer-yet-wimpier trucks and cars that can't keep up their speed.  It also still serves me well on gnarly 4WD routes and snowy mountain roads.  I won't bore you with a long review of a truck that's virtually too old to be worth mentioning.  In fact I sometimes wish it would go belly-up so I'd have an excuse to get something newer.  (All I really wish for is bucket seats instead of the bench.)  When I do get something newer, it'll be either another Ranger (which I'll put a camper on) or a Cherokee since recreational driving is about the only kind I do.  Apologies to Julia Parker for my review title.... ;)<br><br>
