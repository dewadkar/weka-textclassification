            After having massive troubles with my Plymouth Neon (see <a href='/auto-review-3D29-E50E87F-3900AF15-prod6'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-3D29-E50E87F-3900AF15-prod6</a> )I decided I HAD to get a new car. I wasn't particularly interested in anything at the time so I asked my dad for suggestions.  He named a few and one of those that stuck in my head was <i>Volkswagen</i>.  We test drove this as well as several other types of cars in that class: the ACCORD, the CAMRY, GALANT, etc. I had also checked out consumer reports and epinions on the Jetta to be sure to not get stuck with another lemon. The VW Jetta in my mind stayed ahead of all these cars so I decided to buy one. Too bad I had no idea how popular they are!

After FIVE months of waiting I finally have my Jetta!  To be more precise: my silver, grey leather, luxury package, automatic, VR 6 Jetta GLS. I can hardly believe just two weeks ago I hated driving and tried very hard to keep from driving anywhere. This car is wonderful!  Currently I have about 7000 miles on it and I have never been happier. 

<b>The Ride</b>

This car positively floats over the road, even at high speeds (100 or so) the ride is perfectly smooth.  I am pretty sure to be guaranteed my first ticket in this car as it rides so well you can't even tell you are going way, way over the speed limit. 

The engine is also either very quiet, or this car is superbly insulated against sound. I was on the expressway doing about 70, turned the radio down and all I could hear is the air whistling past the car.  Amazing. 

It is also very responsive and handles quick, taking sharp turns in stride.  It hugs the road though I think the larger tires I chose helps as well.  Big change over my fuddy duddy Neon. 

<b>Options</b>

I went for just about everything without going to a GLX.  

<b>Sunroof </b>- Open, closes, and tilts with a twist of a dial. The sunroof opens back UNDER the roof so air noise is very minimal. 

<b>Monsoon stereo</b> - Ok, for a factory car stereo it is very nice. Mine however came with a TAPE deck (how old is that??) and I am planning on replacing it anyway. I am however keeping the 8 speakers it comes with. I have since changed the Monsoon stereo to a Sony I had and it still sounds excellent.  My fiance told me the Monsoon system also comes with a built in amp which I wasn't aware of previously.  Had no choice on whether or not I wanted the Monsoon, it was a standard option. It is massive steps above most "premium" car stereo's however.

<b>Heated leather seats </b> - I went back and forth on whether to get the leather for days and I must say it's well worth it. The leather quality itself I cannot tell you as I have never had a car with leather before, but a friend with a leather clad Camaro states it is better than his car. I gave the heated seats for a whirl to test one day and this is also a must-have for those cold winter days. The seat warms your bottom and back, it's very relaxing. The seats are also comfortable enough for long trips, and adjustable, up, down, in addition to regular adjustments. 

<b>VR6</b> - I don't care those those VW guys may say, the 4 cyl is NOTHING compared to the VR6.  If you can possibly afford it, go for it! Gas mileage is blah, 20 city 26 highway but it sure does pick up and GO. You'll swear this car hates to go slow. Hence my sudden increased possibility for tickets... ;)  I've been up to 100 so far and the Jetta takes it like it's nothing, as if to say we should be going faster than this. 

--------Now the basics:----------


<b>Interior</b> - The front seats are very roomy. The back seats however are no good for adults unless you are taking a quick ride somewhere. Small people and kids only!

The overall impression I got of the inside was what I imagine to be no nonsense German styling.  Everything is simple and strictly functional. The controls are simple to use, though I would like the entire center control area (stereo, air, etc) to be moved UP.  There is a gap where a CD player would go and it's too bad everything else is farther down. 

At night the inside lights are blue and red, it's very sharp. All cars should use this scheme. 

The center console is tiny; you can fit a pair of sunglasses, a cellphone and a few small items and that's about it. The glovebox is also very small and it's only main good point is a small holder for manuals and such. Otherwise your gloves are going in there and little else. 

The cupholders have now been changed to accommodate larger cups and hold them VERY firmly. In fact when you take a cup out the resizable holder closes up which at times makes it difficult to replace the drink with ease. The handy thing is that it is not going to let your cup fly over unless you start the car rolling over somehow. 

The floor mats snap down so they don't slip around or curl up if you kick them weird on accident.  I also purchased a set of rubber VW mats for the winter, which do not snap down but stick to the floor real well.  These have been very useful for all the winter snow slush we get in this area.

The trunk is enormous and the back seats flip over and the part you actually SIT on will move as well if you have a large load. You can also lock those parts in place. 

The remote... you'll laugh but this thing is great. The key and the alarm are together and the key flips out like a switch blade. Everyone at work got a big kick out of that.  There is a button to open the doors, once to open the drivers side, twice for all. A button to open the trunk (LOVE THIS!) and to lock the doors. I'm sure you've seen the commercial, yes you can open and close the windows from the outside of the car by putting it in the lock and holding it left or right. It will close the sunroof but not open it. This is extremely handy as you usually remember your sunroof is open after you get OUT of the car, and it's easy to close it on the outside rather than clamor back into the car, turn it on, and close the window again. 

Speaking of windows there are child locks on the back windows, and the front windows have the auto up and down feature. 

Another thing about the key is the security. I'm told you CANNOT start the car without the magic key. There is a valet key but that only opens the door and starts the car. Doesn't open the glovebox, trunk, gas tank or back seats. So basically if someone wants your car they have to tow it. But if they go and do that you were going to lose your car no matter what. The car has an alarm and there is also a panic button on the remote to make a lot of noise if you want to scare the daylights out of someone by your car. 

Someone had also asked how it's handled in the winter.  I live in the Chicago area so we have some pretty nasty winters. For example for far this winter we've had enough snow to get me sent home for work early (10+ inches of snow!), and tempuratures below 0 degrees. My car doesn't get to live in a garage, in fact, I park outside in a cul-de-sac where there is absolutely NO shelter from the winds within 200 feet or so. It's started up like a champ every day!  The handling in the snow has been good so far too, I've only been STUCK once this winter and that situation would have stuck ANY car in place. 

<b>Exterior</b> Not much to say otherwise this car is sharp.  The front design makes it look more expensive than it is and overall it is very nice. This IS a matter of opinion as well so I won't get into it too much. 

<b>Annoying things</b>

Well I'm NOW at almost 12,000 miles and no troubles of any kind to report yet.  This is just the space for petty complaints for right now. 

To move the seat up and down, there's a simple "push down" or "pull up" lever that handles this.  However for the lumbar support, and to put the seat back DOWN, there are large dials to manage this.  It's so difficult to move the seat down I hardly ever do.  I don't have the strongest hands and reaching behind me and having to grasp the dial and turn and turn AND turn to get the seat down leaves me very frustrated. 

<b>Finally</b>

After driving this car for a while, you almost want to smile and nod knowingly at the silly Jetta commercials. You'll understand what they mean.  So instead of arguing who HAS to drive, you will now argue that YOU want to drive.
