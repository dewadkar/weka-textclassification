            My 2001 Accent that I bought new and enjoyed (for what it was) very much was coming up on its 45K tune-up, needed tires and brakes. The solution? New tires and brakes accompanied by a new 2003 Elantra GT!
I wanted more creature comforts while still on a budget and I figured the Hyundai dealer wouldn't try to kill me on trade-in value on a Hyundai like any other brand would; besides - I'd really been happy with the Accent.
The GT was peppy off the lot, handled nimbly (what is a European-tuned suspension, though?) and the CD sound system was very adequate as is.
I've had it 6 months now and the only complaint I've had is a weird wind noise around 80 mph. Of course it won't reproduce at the dealer and it comes and goes...
Other than that the car is great to drive and very comfortable on the long trips I've taken.
The tripmeter and odometer are not easy to read, looking like a like a little digital wrist watch on the dash. And I miss the feature of the Accent where you could have a singe sweep of the wiper blade with an upward push of the wiper handle. Little things, though...
I'd recommend the GT with 4 wheel disc brakes, leather interior and 6 speaker CD to anyone on a budget that wanted some comfort.
I'd also recommend that Hyundai offer ABS as a stand alone option instead of only as part of a (expensive)package.
