            Ok, I admit it... I bought this vehicle for it's looks. But then, driving it, I realized a few of the reason why it is so great. I love the automatic-manual transmission. Since me and my wife both drive it, I love to use the manual shift, and my wife, who doesn't know how to drive a &quot;stick&quot; uses the automatic transmission, and says that it works great. It has almost everything that I want in a car, reliable, and has an O.K. factory stereo installed. The interior is more roomy than others of it's type, though not really anything special. It has a variety of options that it comes with, including a choice of engines, transmissions, and other features. The interior has the feel of a Cadillac, with leather and black trim. It gives a comfy ride for a sportscar, and when you steer you can tell who is in charge of the car. It a pretty nice engine that it comes with, a V6 that gets 205 horsepower+. Great acceleration. You definitely will need the traction control system, and the anti-theft system. The resale values on Eclipses are pretty good if kept in nice condition. The car I reviewed and drive in is the hard-top version, not the convertible. A great car for the young at heart has arrived, just as the ads say.<br><br>
