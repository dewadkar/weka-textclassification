            My 97 SL still looks brand new.  I have 91,000 KM on it and it still runs just like the day I bought it.  No rattles or creaks anywhere and it still looks great.  For the price it's an excellent little car and of course the Saturn service is top-notch.  I do mostly highway driving and have had no repairs other than scheduled service.  The entire Saturn buying experience is fantastic.  My wife and I both drive Saturns and whenever we return to the dealer for service, all the service and sales people know and remember us.  My wife's lease is up in a few months on her car and we plan on buying it.  After informing our sales person of this, he didn't pressure us at all to trade it in for a new one.
