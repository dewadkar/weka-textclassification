            I have been driven it since last Oct and I'm very
pleased with it.  The only thing is that the AC
seems to be under powered.  It is taking quite
a while for it to cool down.  I'm not sure if 
it is just my car, or it is a common problem with
2000 Max.  Be sure to test it.

The best thing about this car is its back seat. 
Being a lanky 6 feet tall, i climb in and out of the 
back seat with ease, and no longer suffer from leg 
pain from having to sit uncomfortably! The base 
supports of the front seats are moved totally out 
of the way, so your legs can roam free. When I moved 
the front seats all the way up, it felt as if i was 
in a Mercedes SEL600! (which i HAVE been in, so i do 
know! It is quite amazingly large)
