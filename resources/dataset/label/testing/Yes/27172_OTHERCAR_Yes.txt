            I going to start my epinion by telling you how the car performed in my accident this past year:  Its July in the afternoon, I'm coming up to a red light, where there is already someone in front of me.  I put on my anti-lock brakes, which work great with a little calf pressure, and pull in behind them (probably 5 feet separated us).  Then I look in my rear-view mirror and see a MEGA-SIZED car (I think Excursion) coming at us approximately 25 mph with no sign of slowing.  Not good.  I was just about to quench my thirst with a swig of Barq's root beer when !!CRASH!! the mega-car smashes into my rear bumper!  My Passat was propelled into the car in front of me and then surreal silence for a second as Barq's root beer dripped down the inside of my windshield and dash.  Sidenote:  Barq's makes things sticky.  I was shaked up as well as my mom but we got out unscathed as well as all the individuals in the other two cars. (My airbags didn't deploy and that's a good thing because if they did, it wouldn't have made sense, it wasn't that hard of a crash.)  My Passat took the impact like a champ.  I wasn't responsible for the crash but it did cost the other guys insurance approximately $5,900 to repair my car.  (The main cost was because the crash bent my frame.  You could see the frame was bent when you picked up the carpet the covered the spare tire.  There was a crinkle where there shouldn't be a crinkle.  Fixing that crinkle cost the most.)  So concerning crashes this car holds up great.

Concerning other things, I have nothing but good things to say.  I bought the Tip-tronic gear shift which is cool but probably not necessary, but it is cool and that's not a bad thing.  The dash when lite is blue with neon read hands.  Remote keyless entry that also pops your trunk.  I get about 28 mph really.  Tank holds about 14 gallons of gas which takes you a long way.  Their basic radio pumps music as loud as any suped up radio.

Design flaws/problems...
1) When you try to get out of the car and you use the door handle, this is how it works:  Pull once, unlocks the door but you can't exit, Pull twice and now you're out.  (All of my passengers do NOT like this.)
2) The headlight switch, that is used by your left hand located to the left of your steering wheel, wasn't glued right from the start.  I could yank the whole thing out exposing wires if I so choose.  Not a big thing but I don't want to see my headlight wires, do you?
3) Rolling up and down the windows isn't great.  If you lift up or press down 8 millimeters your window will automatically go up or down depending on your finger direction.  If you lift up or press down 5 millimeters you can manually set you window height.  I, to this day, have not perfected the mind to finger algorithm to determine if I'm at 8 or 5 millimeters.  

Other hiccups...
One day, right after I bought my Passat, it was a real humid morning.  My car didn't start that morning.  Was it the humidity?  Who knows.  That was the only time in 2 years of constant use that it didn't start.

Winding up...
You don't need AAA because they have an excellent roadside support.
Free tune-ups (oil and wash and turbo check) for the first 30,000 miles.
Easily seats 5 grown-ups.
Driver and passenger front air-bags as well as side-impact air bags.
Cool little gas lid thats sits neatly on the gas door when opened.
Open the hood and see no space wasted.  (Perfect German engineering)
Heat and air-conditioning work fast.
Great digital display that lets you flip through setting to see things like, current trip distance, current trip time, current miles per gallon, actual time, outside temperature.

Bottomline:  You will be happy if you own this car.
