            I have a 1985 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with a 5.0 liter 305 ci TPFI engine and t-tops.  I bought this car because I wanted a low priced, but fats sports car that would also be my daily driver.  I was considering either a Firebird or a Chevy Camaro.  Both cars are basically the same, with the same engines, and were built at the same plant.  I bought this car for $1,500 with about 90,000 miles on it from a private party.  There were a few problems that the owner neglected to mention.  It needed a new starter, radiator, and battery.  There was a little rust, but not anything eating away through the panels.  After the problems were fixed, everything ran smoothly.  The interior is very comfortable for two people, but the back seat is small. I would highly recommend this car to anyone on a low budget looking for a high performance sports car.  I has great handling, quick acceleration, and a good look.  It is not too much fun to drive on snow or rain, but it is completely possible if you do not accelerate too fast.  The car I owned before this was a 1986 Chevy Celebrity 2.5 Lt. V4, and the use of gas between the two cars is not much of a noticeable difference.  I would recommend this car to anyone wanting a great sports car for a low price.
