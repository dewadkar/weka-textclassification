            I purchased a white 1990 RS model in 1994 the summer after I graduated high school.  The draw for me was that it was a smaller car that looked sporty and got fairly good gas mileage.

This car handles well and has some get up and go.  Not enough to consider it a serious sports car but enough to get you moving in those tight traffic situations.  Being able to fold the seat down was nice for hauling my stuff to and from college, however without the seat down the trunk space was not enough to hold a set of golf clubs in a bag.
I had no major problems with this car, mechanically or otherwise.  I drove for five years before trading it in and was completely satisfied with the deal.  However, a word of warning to those with a turbo as I have heard they are far less reliable.

The person who buys this car should be considering carrying no more than one adult sized passenger.  The space for those in the back is cramped at best even when moving the seats forward.  Other than that, if you like the looks and everything sounds like it is running properly go for it.

Addition 5/14:  I had forgot to mention one bad thing that is also evident by the other comments for this car.  The hatch lifters chosen were the poorest engineering decision!  Barely worked in the summer, and in the winter forget about it.  I always wedged my ice scraper in to hold it up when loading the trunk.<br><br>
