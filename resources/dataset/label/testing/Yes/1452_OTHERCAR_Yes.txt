            I would like to sing the praises of my Purple 1996 Saturn.  We have been to hell and back together.  I believe in my car and want to tell you everything about it; good and the bad.

I bought the car right off the lot in Saginaw, MI.   I needed to dump my high school car fast.  My father co-signed for me and within 3 hours I shopped for the car, inspected the car and bought the car.  I was on the road with a full tank and 12 mile on the odometer.  My car now has over 64,000 miles on it.  I won't tell you it's perfect, no car is.  The Saturn is about as close as a person can get.  

First I want to tell all of the reasons NOT to buy a Saturn because it may not be the car for you.
Don't buy a Saturn if.....
Comfort is greatly important to you.
Small noises and rattles in a used car drive you crazy.
You don't like to change to the oil every 3000 miles.
You have more than 4 people in your family.
You are taller than 5.9
Status and appearances are important to you.

Now I want to tell you all the wonderful things I found out about my Saturn.

Great service and warranty.  I had the console go out within the first three months and the company came and picked up my car over 45 miles from the service center, fixed it, no charge, and brought it back to me in the same day.  When I got into a huge accident with my new 5 month old car, everyone was nice and friendly.  Everything was fixed to my liking and brand new. (it did take 4 weeks and I didn't have a rental -- one minus)
**even after my warranty expired, they still replaced the breaks on my car, and rotated drums for free.  I saved over $300 dollars.  I couldn't be happier with the service.  (you also get free car washed for a year, when you buy the car)

I'm not having any serious problems with my car.  My car treats me well, and I am never worried that I might get stranded somewhere.  I just finally had to replace the tires this year.  I commute over 300 miles per week and I do like to travel.  The car has been to Niagra Falls, Pittsburg. Cinncinatti, and Miami. I might take it too New York this year.  IT IS DEPENDABLE!!!  The one minor draw back is with age come various rattles and noises that I can't seem to fix on my own.  I did take it in once, but that only fixed the problem temporarily.  Also my car is starting to burn oil and I have to keep and eye on it.  Right now I'm trying different oil types and weights to see if I can fix the problem.  But with a 4 1/2 year old car, I can't complain.

I also want to sing the praises of G.M.A.C. financing.  They were the ones who gave me the loan.  They send me a bill every month, and I send it back; easy to remember.  They have never harassed me or even called.  I am have been as many as 14 days late and was never given a warning or late fee.  Very flexible.  

When I buy my next car it might not be a Saturn, but I will go through GMAC again.

Another interesting point is my accident.  I was involved in a serious accident in Jan. 97    I hit a car on an icy expressway, when traffic had stopped for another accident.  My air bags went off and my passenger and I  did not even recieve a scratch.  The repairs were over $6000 to fix the car, which was close to totally it.  I beleive in the safety my car provides when I use my seatbelt and air bag combined.  

I trust my car and that is all.  it is affordable and works for a woman like me.
