            Yes I totally agree with you on that note Ron.  It is the most smooth riding car in this country.  Especially when driven on the road.  When I m driving it feels so nice and smooth.  Its likes you can barely feel anything moving.  What I love it is the storage space, Stereo/CD system that it has for you to listen to music, and it is also excellent for traveling.  I love how it makes you feel like you are in a van or a truck. I also love the high-level seating arrangement.  Especially for riding.  It is very comfortable.  I would say either a man or a women can purchase this vehicle.

The reason why I purchased one was for storage space, traveling, and smoother riding.  But I wouldn't recommend very short people to buy this vehicle because the high-level driving and seating arrangement is too high.  They won't be able to reach the peddles.  The only thing that I don't like about this vehicle is, &quot;It burns up a lot of gas,&quot; and gas is very expensive for every week.  But I do love the latest Automatic features that they have made over the last 2 years.  They are AWESOME!!<br><br>
