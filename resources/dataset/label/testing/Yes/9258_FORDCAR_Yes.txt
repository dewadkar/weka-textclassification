            Name a car that can do 0-60 in the mid 7s, the 1/4 in the

low-mid 15s, hanlde as good as a new Mustang GT, achieve 35

miles to the gallon, have 4 doors, and cost under 20 grand?

Well I can honestly only think of one, my friends, and that is

the 2000 Ford Contour SE Sport 5 speed.  

	The Ford Contour is without a doubt one of the most under-

rated cars in automotive history, and that is no joke.  It is

an absolute shame that no one realized what this car really

was:  a formidable sports car in a very innocent looking 

body.  You see, my friends, there are two kinds of Contours

on the road:  4-cylinder and V6 non-Sport automatics, and the

ones like our's, an SE Sport 5 speed.  Big big difference

indeed.  Unfortunately, Contour's like our's represent about

1% of the Contours on the road today.  I have yet to see

another SE Sport V6 5 speed other than our own.  So because

of the fact that 99% of the Contours seen are basically low

performing economy cars, people automatically assume that ALL

Ford Contours are low-buck pieces of junk.  Prepare to be

suprised.  

	We own a 2000 Ford Contour SE Sport 5 speed in Harvest

Gold.  Inside are Medium Graphite sport cloth buckets.  Ford

did not offer leather in 2000, so the option list was very

limited.  We added a power driver's seat, floor mats, moonroof,

premium CD player, front liscense plate bracket (Illinois is

like one of 3 states that still do that), and the smoker's 

package, which is ironic because my dad hasn't smoked since

the Eisenhower administration.  The only options we did not

order were ABS and Traction Control.  My dad does not like 

either one.  I can understand his point under certain

situations.  

	Probably the best feature of our car is the engine itself.

The 2.5L Duratec V6 is probably the 2nd best engine I've ever

driven with, the 1st being the Mustang Cobra's 32V Modular V8.

This engine makes a solid 170 ponies.  Not normally a scary 

amount, but the kicker is that the Contour weighs a little 

under 3000 pounds, about like the late Ford Probe.  170 horses

pulling 2900 or so pounds is a great combination.  And with the

5 speed manuals close ratios and low 4.06 front-end, you can

easily take care of roughly 95% of the cars you see on the 

road in your daily commute.  This engine pulls great from

4000 rpm upward, and even down low it can pull pretty good.  

In fact, while cruising on the highway in 5th gear, it is

RARELY necessary to downshift to pass somebody.  With the 

low gearing and 2800 rpm 64 mph cruise speed, it pulls very

well even in top gear.  Come to a stoplight and turn the radio

off and it's hard to tell if the engine is running or not.  And

the engine makes a very wonderful growl under full throttle,  

unlike the pushrod crap that GM refuses to quit making.  It

is a very smooth and powerful engine indeed.  

	As far as our gas mileage, the best we have recorded so

far was this past summer.  We got 34 mpg from mostly 74 mph

interstate cruising with the A/C on.  Move down to about 55

mph and turn the A/C off and I can easily see 36 mpg.  So 

having 4-cylinder fuel economy from a fast car is the best

of both worlds.  And around town we still get roughly 24 to 

25 mpg.  Factor in the 14.5 gallon tank and a trip of over

500 miles on a tank is not out of the question.  

	As far as it's performance, I'm glad you asked.  I can 

honestly say that I have yet to be beaten on the road in this

car.  This past summer my dad beat a guy in a Monte Carlo Z34

that was behind him and then tried to go around him when dad

was slowing for the car in front turning off.  Dad and the

Monte both slowed down to about 5 mph or so and dad put it in

1st and sure enough the Monte moved into the other lane to make

it's move.  Dad said he kept the Monte behind him until mom

told him to stop at about 95 or so.  Just imagine the look

on the Monte's driver's face to see this innocent looking

small Ford economy sedan kicking his "supposedly" sporty

Chevy coupe's butt.  I've read for years in the magazines

about how the GM 3800 engine is among the best engines made

today and blah blah blah.  But I guess this little 2.5L was

happy to teach it a lesson in modern technology.  And let's 

see whose engine is still running after 150,000 miles  hint 

hint:  pushrod is 50+ years old    DOHC is modern :)  And heck,

when my dad did this, it was my 235 pound dad driving, my 185

pound mom riding, and a weekend of luggage in the trunk.  I 

weigh 165 myself, so when it is just me in the car, it really

does fly.  Also this summer, a friend of mine was telling me

how big of a piece of crap our Contour was and that his '96

Chevy Z71 with the wonderful 350 would kick your butt.  It

was also slightly modified, but even with the mods, when we

finally took our vehicles out on the road, he tried to go

around me at 65 mph, but he could only get to my rear fender

before I started pulling on him.  We did it again at 35 mph

and I killed him even worse at that speed.  Our car is bone

stock, but I am planning on putting a K&N Air Filter in for

next summer just to see what those things can really do.

And for some weird reason, these people in their stupid SUVs and 

trucks all think they're fast, and I've had the quick yawn of 

shutting them down as well.  What I'm really waiting for is the 

chance to find a new V6 5 speed Mustang, Camaro, or Firebird.  

Imagine a little economy sedan beating up on these classic 

ponycars :) Granted, they're not V-8s and I would never bother 

with them, but our Contour will tackle more than most people 

would think.  So basically, my friends, the Contour, when in the 

right setup like ours, will provide more than ample go power.

Now as far as handling, it is just as impressive as the

acceleration.  The Sport package makes this car handle like

a pure sports car should.  We were in the Smokey Mountains

this summer, and whenever we saw a sign for a curve that said

30 mph, we would laugh.  The Contour can easily add 20 to 25

mph to any turn without even beginning to push the car out.

Try that in your porky SUV.  If mom wasnt in the car with us, 

we would have had some real fun.  The only car in this class

I can think of that can outperform our Contour is an SVT 

Contour.  And if we had the money we would have certainly 

bought one.  

	Now as far as reliability, we have owned this car for

2 years and 25,000 miles, and have yet to have a problem with

anything.  There is a slight squeak in the passenger door

near the speaker, but we havent got around to fixing it yet.

The engine and structure and everything else has performed

flawlessly.  And with the engine this good, I can easily see

200,000 miles with the proper routine care given.  Most people

that say Contours are unreliable are usually those that have

either driven a rental car, which should never be judged for

anything due to the numerous amount of torture rental cars 

receive, they have not done the routine maintenance which is

indeed a good thing to do once in a while, or they have simply

had a bad-luck Contour, and it happens.  Not all cars are

created equal, even those of the same model.

	As far as interior comfort, here's one of the biggest

bashes of the Contour.  I've read for years about how the 

back seat is so small and blah blah blah.  Folks, I'm a 6'3

165 lb 20 year old male, and I will honestly say that I have

no problem whatsoever with our car's back seat.  We take

numerous long trips, and I have no complaints sitting in the

back behind my 5'8 or so mother.  I actually like the back

seat almost as much as the front's because they have a deep

bucket to sit on that helps my legs to stay on the seat, and 

it also makes my butt more comfortable.  In the front seat, I

have no problems there either.  It feature the power driver's

seat with lumbar.  The lumbar soothes my back on long trips

very nicely, and if it wasnt for the power adjustment, I would

be out of luck because it helps to tilt the front half of the

seat upward so my legs are on the seat.  Otherwise, I'd be

uncomfortable, but I am fine for sitting in any seat in our

car.  Now I dont know how tall these guys are that have been

griping about the Contour over the years, but unless they are

all taller than 6'3, I would tell them to shut up.  I really

am 6'3, and yes I really do fit in the back seat with ease.

So ha ha ha ha :)

	Now as far as other tidbits, the cd player is a pretty

good system.  It's not a bass boomer by any means, but I am

more concerned with horsepower than stereo power anyway.  The

headlights on this car are the best I have ever seen on the

bright setting, even more than my dad's F-150's brights.  

They're simply awesome.  And we also have the fog lamps, but

unlike other people that seem to think fog lamps are for

crystal clear nights, we only use fog lamps when it's FOGGY,

RAINY, OR SNOWY  hmm  maybe that's what Ford designed them

for :)  They dont add anything to way down the road nighttime

vision so why waste the wattage on crystal clear nights??

Pardon me if this review was a little arrogant, but I've been wanting to say this for some time.
