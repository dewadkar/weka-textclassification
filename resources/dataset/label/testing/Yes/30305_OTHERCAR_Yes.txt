            This review is for a base model 4-door 4-cylinder 2.6L manual transmission Isuzu Trooper II.

I purchased this car brand new for only $12,000 right before the new body style was introduced. What a bargain! I didn't get any extras at all. No A/C, no captain's chairs, small rims/tires, NOTHING. Over the years, I've upgraded quite a few things and the truck has held up marvelously. If you are in the market to purchase this SUV, this is the review you should read because I will tell you everything you need to watch out for.

1. Valves.  I cannot stress this enough. The valves absolutely must be adjusted every 10,000-15,000 miles religiously. If you do not, you risk bending the valves and causing serious damage.  I know, because I bent my valves in the first year I owned the car. Luckily, it was covered under warranty.  But I learned my lesson and ever since then, I've adjusted the valves like clockwork.  People are amazed I still have the original engine after 150,000 miles but I think it's because of my frequent oil changes and valve adjustments.  If you are inspecting a trooper for purhcase, listen to the valves. If you hear a loud "clicking," the valves are out of adjustment and if severely clicking, they might be bent.

2. Tranny.  The manual tranny is very sensitive. The weird thing about this tranny is that it takes regular motor oil not tranny oil. My tranny is whining very bad and I need a new one.  I think somewhere down the line some Jiffy Lube inadvertantly put in tranny oil and messed it up but I can't pinpoint who did it. Just be careful of the whining tranny, but if you hear it, it has very little life left on it.

3. Power.  This truck is so incredibly weak, don't buy this thing if you want a powerful workhorse. The tranny is tuned to be high torque at low gears and that's about it. 1st & 2nd gear are moderately powerful but once you hit 3rd gear, the power drop is enormous. Uphill, I get top speeds of 35 MPH. Climbing mountains, I have to stay in the slow lane. The V6 model has much higher torque but this 4 cylinder is pretty weak. 

4. Aerodynamics. Aerodynamics? What aerodynamics? my friends call my trooper the "Toaster" because it's a big box.

5. Accepts big tires. I mounted 31x10.5x15" tires on my truck and it definitely helped cornering and stability.  With the OEM wheels, the car felt extremely top-heavy. The truck still feels top-heavy but it's reduced due to the tires. Expect to take big wide turns.

6. Terribly dangerous in high wind conditions.  In high winds, the car blows all over the place because it's so high and non-aerodynamic.  I literally felt the car jerk all over the road.  When it's raining, due to the big tires, if I hit a big rain puddle, the pressure of the water kicked up from the puddle causes an extremely dangerous condition where I've hydroplaned several times.

7. Performs excellent in the snow. With all-season tires and a strong battery, I was able to hit big bear, mammoth, etc. with no problems. Truck sat out in a snow storm for 3 days and still started up with no problems and kept very good traction in 4x4 mode.

8. Lots of headroom. Doesn't matter how tall you are, you will have plenty of room up top. 

9. Seats not very durable. My seats are cloth and vinyl. They are not very durable and have cracked over the years. If you can, get leather seats or at least he captain's chairs which come with arm rests.

10. Base model doesn't even come with under-the-dash-covers.  You can see everything down there including the vent system unless you buy the covers. I did and it made a huge difference.

11. Foglights.  Mine didn't come with foglights but the front bumper comes with 2 pre-drilled locations for mounting foglights. Sweet! But you still have to wire them.

12. Towing. I added a Class 2 hitch to the truck for when I was moving. I towed a medium-sized trailer with a full apartment's worth of furniture and things totally packed in there. The truck did a decent job pulling it but when I was driving down a long steep hill (CA grapevine), it was very scary. The brakes were not gripping very well and I had to pull the emergency brake to slow down.  I do not recommend towing heavy things with this car unless you upgrade the braking system.

Over 11 years, I've had my share of problems with this car but not that many compared to most.  Here is a COMPLETE list of things I've repaired:
1. bent valves (failed to adjust valves, my fault)
2. Vacuum hose broke (warranty fix)
3. Idler arm went out (120,000 miles)
4. Muffler replaced (147,000 miles)
5. 3 Batteries (ever car has to change a battery)
6. Headlight cracked (rock)
7. Headlight wiring shorted
8. Multiple windshields (rocks, etc)
9. Vent system failed (warranty fix)
10. Starter (80,000 miles)

Outstanding problems unfixed:
1. Rear main seal leak (slight)
2. shocks worn (still feels fine though)
3. tranny going out (whines severely)

Through the life of the car, that is IT. Not bad for a car with over 11 years and 150,000 miles under its belt. Notice, I've never replaced the clutch (it's hydraulic), never replaced the water pump, or the radiator. They may be due, but I've gone this far without doing it.  I love this truck and with a little bit of work, it's very driveable.
