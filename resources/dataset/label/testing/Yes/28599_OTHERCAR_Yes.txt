            Everybody making opinions here drives or owns a Jeep Tj.
Which stands for Trendy Jeep.
These are the people who purchase this vehicle without learning the background of Jeep, which happens to be the international symbol of freedom or understanding the friendly Jeep wave. Anyone who has time to complain about the Jeep dosen't have the right to own it. You should be on such a high when you climb in it, that you take a steep away from the worlds problems. I won't even get started on if you happen to live in a warm climate year round...anyways I personally own a 77 Cj which is known as the  Civilian Jeep, and the last AMC motor year with a 90 Islander. Half doors, Full doors...the only way to drive this machine is with no doors...It's a Jeep thing, You wouldn't understand !

There are opinion details which most probably work for most vehicles but not the Jeep.
For Reliability...it was made for war...except chyslers
For comfort...it has the ability to outdo a porsche in the pick up 
              department, girl or guy...
and so on...
bye now...
