            I am driving a 1998 Camry, which I've had for about 80,000 miles, and which is my seventh Toyota.  These cars seem to run forever with so few repairs!  I see Fords on the road and always remember what Stan, my trusted mechanic, would say about them:  Found On Road Dead, or Fix Or Repair Daily.  Why would anyone want such a car?  

My Camry is so delightful.  I have made very few repairs over the years, and I'm at 91,000 miles.  I am religious about getting a lube and oil change every 3,000 miles and have done this with all my Toyotas over the years. My maintenance and repairs on this one:

    new tires at about 40,000 miles (Toyota does put cheap-o new tires on their new cars, I'm afraid...);  
    replacing the timing belt at 60,000 miles (it didn't need one; this was preventive maintenance);
    replacing air filters and windshield wipers; 
    draining and re-filling the transmission fluid and radiator (preventive maintenance); 
    paying about $300 for a starting problem (replacement of the air intake valve); 
    replacing the spark plugs and having a tune-up, water pump and fuel filter replaced, at about 40,000 miles (all preventive maintenance);
    and that's about it.  Pretty nice for 91,000 miles, huh? 
  
Inside I'm very comfortable with all the cubbyholes, drink holders, door map pockets, air conditioning/heater and radio/stereo controls.  Everything is within reach, no bending or peering required.  (I have driven rental cars in which I nearly had to stand up or lie down on the seat to read the speedometer or find the radio while driving!)

The car drives like a brand new car, in my opinion.  When the motor is running, it's difficult to tell whether it's turned on or not because it's so quiet.  There is ample power, even on hills.  I've always felt totally in control of the car and feel that it handles very well, although I'm a pretty sedate driver... On a mountain twisty road, I'm very cautious and hope like heck that some hotshot is not coming at me in my lane from around the next curve!   

I find this an extremely comfortable car, but then I'm pretty flexible and fairly lightweight (140 lbs.).  Were I obese or if I had bad knees, etc. I might feel somewhat  differently.  For me, it's very comfortable.  The driver's seat has an adjustment wheel on the left-hand side, but I haven't used it much.  It adjusts the seat very slightly, and it's hard to tell the difference.       

I can hold five people comfortably in the car, although if anyone is over "normal" size, four would be the maximum.  I've driven to Canada from California several times in the car, and have gone on other extensive road trips.  I also traveled for business for a few years, and I was always very comfortable being in the car for several hours at one time.  The firmness of the seat and the headrest are correct ergonomically and insure that the driver's back won't ache after a long trip. Another feature I love is the gas tank's capacity, which is about 16 gallons.  With the excellent mileage I get (30-33 mpg), I'm hardly ever at the gas station!  

I long for a 2003 Camry, but I am having a very hard time convincing myself that it would be a cost-effective or prudent purchase.  My car is so perfect, why would I change it?  

My former Toyotas were all driven to well over 100,000 miles, with very few repairs, and then sold to friends or family members, who continued with very few problems.  Riding in my wonderful Camry has convinced friends to also purchase Camrys, and of course they are also delighted.

Local dealers have recently been making me such good offers on new ones... I may give in.  I will, however, never drive anything but a Toyota.
