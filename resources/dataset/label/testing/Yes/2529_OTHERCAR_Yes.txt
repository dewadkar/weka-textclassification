             My parents are the coolest! Instead of junking or selling their old cars, they give them to me. This car, a 1978 Impala was one car I had always wished I owned. The day my dad told me that I could have it after he got a new one, I was excited!

  This car was not only an awesome car, it also had a lot of memories in it. I rememeber being driven all over the place in it as a teen. The car had been on many trips to Kansas and back. Back then I spent the duration of the trips lounging  in the back seat listening to my Walkman. That seat was so comfortable. I remember crashing out quite a bit.

  I rememeber when I was learning to drive and the car I had been using was in the shop. Instead of waiting, my dad offered to let me drive it. That was like a big deal to me because my dad loved that car. For him to let me use it was like a major expression of love and trust. 

  When I got behind the wheel I felt like I had been driving my whole life. It was so easy to handle. I was sold on Chevys after that day. The car had always been well maintained and well taken care of. 

  Well the day came that my dad got his new car. He surprised me one day by bringing the car over with my mom following in the new car. He took me up to the title bureau and signed it to me. I felt real special that day. 

  I drove the car and took good care of it. The car lasted for 2 more years even though the mechanic said the undercarriage of the car was in bad shape from all the road salt. They had told my dad the car wouldn't last another winter but in all it lasted 3 after the diagnosis.

  The car was metalic saffron with tan seats. It had an AM/FM radio. no frills just some really cool gauges. The seats were so comfortable you could sleep in them. 

 The motor was a 305 and it had some guts. It was really good on gas for an 8 cylinder. Of all the cars I've had over the years, I miss this one the most. When it was ready for the junk yard, I let my ex take the car for a while. He got an extra 4 months out of it before it all fell apart on him.

  That car was like a friend till the end. It lasted for me and then costed my ex over 1000 bucks to keep it going for that 4 months and nearly killed him. What a car,, gives good service then gets even with my ex for me. I loved that car!!!!

  If I could find one just like it, I'd be the first in line to buy it.
