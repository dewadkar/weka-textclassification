            I bought this car in December 1998 after a 2 month period on the dealer's waiting list.  There was a good reason why I had to wait for this car -- it is one of the best values given the impressive array of standard features.  I paid the sticker price ($28,405 MSRP plus destination charge) and got the dealer to throw in car mats (which really should of been standard equipment).  For this price, the car came with heated seats, a premium sound system with a separate woofer in the back, power sunroof and mirrors, 16 inch wheels, leather seats, xenon headlights, 4-speed tiptronic transmission, and a silky smooth 225hp engine.  The car is a great cruising vehicle -- it effortlessly motors along at 100mph (don't tell the cops!) and has very good acceleration.  

Now so far I haven't told you anything you maybe can't get from reading some of the articles and road tests written on the car.  OK, so here is the skinny:

- The best thing about the car is its headlights!  I love the xenon lights.  These headlights really provide a much better driving experience.  The light is whiter and lights up the road much better than standard halogen headlights.  Some of the newer luxury cars on the market have xenon headlights as standard equipment.  

- The sound system is great but there is problem.  In trying to design the car with smooth lines, Acura choose to embed the radio antenna into the windshield.  While they achieved their design goals, the radio sensitivity has suffered.  Radio stations that may of come in clear with your other car, now may come across with a little static.  I asked my dealer about this problem, and he mentioned that they have received a number of complaints about this issue.  Don't get me wrong, the stereo system is great, it's just that the antenna sensitivity could be improved.

- Many people have positive comments on the &quot;font&quot; used for the gauges; for Office 2000 users, its looks like a &quot;Times New Roman&quot; font.  It looks good!

- The engine has a great purr to it.  When you accelerate, it sounds awesome.  Also, the two tailpipes really tell other drivers that this car has some power under its hood.

- The ride is a little soft, but I guess that this is to be expected given that it is a luxury sedan and shares some of the same components and chassis as the Honda Accord sedan.  As for most front wheel drive cars, it understeers when pushed hard into the corners.  The car will not surprise you though, it behaves like a well-balanced front wheel drive car should.

In short, this car is great.  And if your a single male and are concerned about whether the ladies would like such a conservative 4-door sedan, don't be -- girls love it!
