            I have been a Cadillac owner for many years and have previously driven a Seville SLS that I liked very much.  The STS has been everything that I thought it would be.  The car is beautiful and has all of the options any luxury car owner would desire.  The fit and finish are deserving of the price tag and the performance is outstanding.  Gas mileage is quite good for a car requiring premium fuel.  I was told that the ride would be harsher than the SLS, but I find that to be not true.

If you have a lead foot, this car needs careful watching.  The car is always ready, willing and able to take on anything on the road.  The car is extremely smooth and quiet and unless you are using the cruise control, you will want to be especially watchful of the speed you are cruising at.

My customers have been extremely complimentary of the comfort level, ease of entry and exit, and the quality of the automobile.  The only complaints I have experienced are concerning the comfort of riding as the middle seat passenger in the rear.  I don't believe that the car has as much rear seat room as my previous 1997 Seville, however, passengers just don't complain. 

Trunk space is sufficient to transport most anything fitting the entrance.  Height of entry is convenient.

My only complaints of the automobile are with the electric components.  GM seems to have some difficulty correcting minor problems, however, the dealer network is superior and Cadillac seems to stand behind their loaner program.

Cadillac would be well advised to change the location of the seat memory buttons, as they are easily altered in error when opening the drivers door.<br><br>
