            Of the huge number of digital cameras available, I picked this one because of the lens. It looks like a 'real' lens, has a proper optical zoom and I hoped that I might get pictures of comparable quality to those from my SLR (Pentax MZ-30). It's first outing came on holiday in Morocco and although a little sceptical when I looked at the snaps on the LCD viewer (which is surprisingly bright, and functions well in all but the brightest direct sunlight), when I got home and saw them on my monitor, I was amazed. The picture quality is really excellent (all the pics I took were in '3M' mode however, the highest quality; I have not experimented with 2/1/0.3). I took shots in low light levels, darkness, bright sunlight and 'low contrast' backgrounds (the desert!). Not a single problem as far as my untrained eye can see.
Software installation and picture transfer were a breeze, no problems.
There are a few points which, while not problems themselves, require one's attention if you're to get the best from the camera...
1) You do need a steady hand to get good sharp shots, and it takes a little practice. I reckon I deleted a good 30 shots because of blurring until I got used to this. 
2) 'Night' mode is very good, but requires a solid surface or tripod. Free-standing is not an option
3) Again related to steadiness of the camera, you have to gently squeeze the button. 'Click' it and you'll nudge the camera and lose focus.

Some (very) minor irritants
1) The supplied card, 16M is next to useless; get the 64M (100 or so shots at maximum resolution).
2) I continually used the LCD rather than the viewer and suspect this led to the end of the supplied set of batteries in about 60-70 pictures (I rarely used the flash), so don't expect long battery life.
3) The lens cover has a rather imprecise fitting; it doesn't 'snap on' very nicely.

One major gripe; while possibly due to my own incompetence, it would appear that the flash unit has to be popped up manually. While not a major headache (although mine did jam, but that was due to sand), it does seem a strange decision to leave this important function un-automated.

Overall, an easy to use camera which yields impressive results. I have no regrets about buying it and would do so again without hesitation.
