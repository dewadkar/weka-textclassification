            I really need to start off by saying that this car has been a god send as I have owned many a lemon in my early driving years. I have had this car for about a year and a half and it has been wonderful! 

I frequently have my mom's boyfriend (has his own car repair shop)look it over to see if it needs anything and he comes back with the same diagnosis. "I think that you will have many wonderful years together.". LoL. I find this car extremely reliable as I travel weekly for about a two hour trip.
 Not to mention that the gas mileage is phenominal. I really look for that gas prices being what they are these days. I can put 10 dollars in my car and depending on where I travel it can last anywhere from 2 to 2 and a half weeks. What more can you ask for? 

Unfortunately I have the very basic model power nothing, Sweat your butt off in the summer and better install your own cd player. It's a very sporty great looking little car and really has spirit. 

If only this car was a person it might be the most reliable one on this planet. Over all this is a great little car that only demands an oil change about every 3000 miles. I really enjoy driving it and feel extremely safe.

 It has anti lock breaks which are wonderful for the slippery roads I endure in the winter and passenger and driver side airbags. 

I really enjoy my time driving in this car. My only negative would have to be the fact that I would advise anyone purchasing one of the awesome speciman of car to choose fully loaded! 

I will the second time around!
