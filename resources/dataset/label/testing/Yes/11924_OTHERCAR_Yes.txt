            I purchased my Agfa 780c from AOL which was a first for online buying.  I was looking for an affordable and easy to use digital camera.  I was very pleased with the product.  I found the camera easy to use but the only really in depth instruction were on the cd that came with the camera.  Of course, I printed all the material because I don't have a clue about photos or cameras.  We have had a lot of fun with the Agfa 780c taking pictures of the grandkids and showing them the picture immediately.  I do wish the memory card held more pictures with the higher resolutions.  I liked the price 239.00 plus shipping which came to 259.00 total for everything.  It took several weeks to be delivered but AOL advised us the popularity of the camera caused a delay in shipping.  
If you enjoy emailing photos and printing cards and such this is a good deal.
I have found it difficult to print the pictures but it may be me and not the camera and softwear.  I would reccomend this camera to anyone.<br><br>
