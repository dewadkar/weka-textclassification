            Great car - formerly a news car from a TV station, LOTS of power under the hood, very reliable for a 7 year old car with 140,000 city miles.  The paint is good, very little rust, great heating and air conditioning, and good sounding audio system.  Due to the amount of miles of the engine, it burns a little oil, but there are no squeaks and one or two rattles, but only on bumpy roads like construction areas and cobble stones.  It has great steering and handling, in fact the best in a full size Ford in years.  It has great brakes due to four wheel discs and the accelerator pedal has a light feel.<br><br>
