            After doing a lot of research and comparing many vehicles I decided to purchase the Honda CRV.  I have been driving it now for about a year and a half.  My overall opinion of the little sport utility is that I love it.  I just recently had a baby so the back seat is the perfect height for installing and removing the car seat. It has many little storage compartments and the removable picnic table is great when camping or stopping for a picnic lunch on the road. 

The interior is very spacious for a small sport utility.  Back seat passengers always have plenty of leg room even with the front seats pushed back all the way.  

Driving the CRV is nice because you are up higher than you would be in a car so visibility is good and it feels like you're driving a smaller car as opposed to a large truck.  The drive is also smooth and the vehicle brakes well. However, the cruise control leaves much to be desired.  It loses speed even on small hills and down-shifts abruptly while climbing hills.  Another thing I don't like is that the engine is sometimes lacking in power.  A V-6 engine would be much nicer especially when carrying a full load.  

The seats are very firm but they are still pretty comfortable.  I like that the back seats as well as the front seats have sufficient head support.  Everything is placed nicely in the dash making all controls easy to reach.  The only thing I hate is that the power window controls do not light up at night.  

The exterior of the CRV is adorable.  When I compared the CRV to the Toyota RAV4 I found them to be similar in many ways, but the RAV4 to me is ugly and has strange proportions.  The RAV4 looks like a shoe.  The CRV is much nicer looking.  The only thing I don't like about the exterior of the CRV is the high-profile tail lights.  The front end is cute and the vehicle's proportions are well balanced.  

In my opinion I think it's a great little SUV and would be a perfect vehicle for someone who is on the go a lot, likes camping, or needs a little more cargo space than a trunk.  It's also great for someone who has kids and hates the idea of having a mini-van. <br><br>
