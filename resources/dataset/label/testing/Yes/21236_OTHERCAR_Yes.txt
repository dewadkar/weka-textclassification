            I'm 70 years old and, up to now, owning a car has been a necessary evil  The Toyota 2000 LE changed all of that.  
We bought it primarily because of the favorable reviews it got and immediate availability.
It best attribute is its user friendliness.  Everything is done almost automatically.  I can think of nothing I really hate although I do find that getting in and out of the drivers side is sometimes difficult although the steering wheel tilts. The owners manual is the one feature I hate although it is not the car.  It is poorly written, not user friendly, not well indexed and revels in obfuscation. I thought the salesmen I dealt with were less than candid and honest and made a career out of misstatements.
Driving this car is a dream.  It just glides along so smoothly and quietly with all of the controls readily accessible and programmed to alert the driver. The theft protection (an extra) is very valuable, the gas tank and trunk levers are a nice convenience.  The sound system is delightful.  The clock and thermometer and mileage counter make life a little easier.
I would recommend this as a family car.  I would not recommend this for the very young or the &quot;swinging&quot; generation.  Especially nice for middle to older aged people.<br><br>
