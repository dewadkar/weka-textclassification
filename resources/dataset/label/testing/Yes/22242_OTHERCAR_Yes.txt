            Two weeks after purchasing a Z3 Roadster 2.8, my wife and I were out for a sunny Saturday afternoon drive.  As luck would have it, we happened by the local BMW dealership in Boulder, CO USA.  Sitting out front was a 2000 Titanium Silver M Coupe.  As I was salivating, my wife utters &quot;what the ____ is that and how much does it cost?&quot;  An hour later we were signing on the dotted line.  
The M Coupe is an amazing automobile.  On the outside, well, you be the judge.  Personally, I am awed by it.  Bravo to the designers at BMW.  A much-needed spark for sports car design.  Inside, a very comfortable cockpit.  The instrument cluster is neat, heated leather seats are 6-way electrically adjustable, and the views are unobstructed.  
Driving this car is fun in any kind of traffic.  It is a true high-performance sports car.  Taking in to consideration its performance numbers for 0-60, 0-100, 1/4 mile and braking distances, this car is in the company of Acura NSX, Porsche 911, and Corvette C-5.  Depending on which sets of numbers you believe, the M Coupe goes 0-60 in 4.9, and does 13.9 in the standing 1/4 mile.  Factor in the unique style, pure drivability and BMW M performance, and the M-Coupe is a bargain at $43 K.
