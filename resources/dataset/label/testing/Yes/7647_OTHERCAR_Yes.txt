            This is definitely an SUV with a presence on the road and the parking lot.  This chick arrived at the Walmart parking lot and circled around for some time until she decided to use the lot that is parallel to where I parked my Jeep.  Thinking that she recognized me, she immediately rolled down her window to take a look at me before realizing that I was not the person she was expecting.  My head was down on the passenger's seat as I was gathering my mail to send out at the nearby post office.  The driver of the new 2002 Mercury Mountaineer continued to sit in her truck until a male partner arrived in a GMC Envoy.  By then, I was on my way to the entrance of Walmart.  After taking care of my business, I came out to take a better look at this engineering marvel that was parked close to my vehicle.  From that moment, I made up my mind to test drive it.  Two week ends ago, I had the time to do just that.

<b>2002 Mercury Mountaineer Is An Upscale, Smooth Machine, A Feast Of Design And Engineering</b>

There is no doubt that you too will feel attracted to the exterior beauty, styling of this SUV.  That's nothing.  Wait until you get inside to find out how this new SUV rides.  I have been impressed with its relatively quiet ride.  I was told that its independent rear-suspension design greatly improves the ride and handling. Examining its interior, you will find out that it has a folding third-row seat.  The SUV can easily accommodate up to seven passengers.  The Mountaineer I was test-driving is powered by a V8 engine.  It has a great handle on the freeways.  It reminds me of the newly redesigned Ford Explorer with which it shares a few interesting features.  For example, a brand-new chassis and other key details that make the 2002 Mercury Mountaineer a high-tech machine on the road.

On the Mountaineer models, you will find a standard 5-speed automatic transmission with a 210-hp V6 or the optional 239-hp V8.  The sales man I was driving around with said that he likes showing this SUV to potential buyers.  He likes the way it shifts and accelerates on the roads.  Most of his customers enjoy its lavish interior.  It's very spacious and quite relatively low to the ground.  This will facilitate any female occupants to hop in and exit without any trouble.  There is no doubt that Ford's new emphasis on reliable engineering is paying off.  Borrowing from the Ford Explorer truly helps place the Mercury in a league of its own.  All the new additions have elevated the 2002 Mercury Mountaineer to an unbeatable, unreachable level. Many competitors won't be able to touch this type of attention to details, engineering and designs for a long time. 

I would recommend this truck to anybody who cares about comfort, image and high standards.  If you are sensitive to key safety elements in an SUV, you will invest in this Mercury's SUV.  All you should expect is a smooth, quiet and controllable ride.  It comes equipped with all the standard features and more.  

If I cruised in it with mucho gusto, you will appreciate it too.  It will make a great impression on you after you have had a chance to be in it.

This Mercury could be a good gift idea this holiday season.
