            I've owned a Mercedes Benz, a Ford Taurus, and a Honda Civic -- the Accord beats them in reliability by 100%. A bit of advice:

* Don't get leather seats if you live in a HOT state, even if the leather is light-colored unless you like the feel and smell of burnt skin. 

* Install a serious alarm system because Honda's get stolen left and right. 

* If you enjoy music, a CD player (or cassettes if you're still stuck in the 80's) would be fantastic for road trips. 

* I've had a lot of hit and runs for some reason, so I've had to deal with a lot of paint jobs and fixing little things such as the locks. They will automatically pop up and down causing a really annoying sound. Unfortunately, I dropped $1,000 trying to fix a few problems (after 5 or 6 years of ownership), but the locks kept popping up and down after a few months. Then again, it could have been my mechanic...
