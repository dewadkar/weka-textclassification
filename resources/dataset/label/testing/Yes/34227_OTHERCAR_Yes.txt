                    I purchased a Camry Solara about 3 months ago and I absolutely love it.  The model that I bought was the SE V6.  You can choose between the SE, SE V6, and the all luxurious SLE V6 that comes with sunroof or moonroof and a leather interior.
         
I actually went to the dealership to purchase the 2000 Celica and the Solara just happened to catch my eye on the way to financing.  After doing a price comparison, I figured the best car for my money was the Solara.  My final cost ended up being $21, 650 and that's not bad at all for the amenities that come with the car.
        
<b>FEATURES</b>
. Front and Side airbags
. Anti-lock breaks
. Anti-Theft System (optional)
. Full-sized spare tire
. Great Gas Mileage 33 City 37 Highway (Varies depending on driver)
. Leather comes with the SLE model
. Sunroof is optional (standard with the SLE)
. A/C (Air Conditioning)
. Tape Deck and CD Player in one
. AM/FM Tuner
. Cruise Control
. Automatic or Manual transmission
. Rear Seats fold down for added Trunk Space
. Trunk Space (I have to be honest, IT'S HUGE!!!) 
... <i>ON A SIDE NOTE</i>, I'm a big guy at 6'1 235 and my fiance who is 5'4 (sorry, can't release the weight or she'll kill me) both fit inside of the trunk ... I can't stress how much this trunk has helped when we've gone on vacation, grocery shopping and purchased large objects such as desks and chairs ... The trunk is tall, deep, and should be able to handle almost anything you wish to put in there
. Spacious interior
... <i>ON A SIDE NOTE</i>, the back seat is actually so big that my friend, who is 6'4 by the way, actually dove into the back seat with enough room to land ... needless to say, I was shocked



<b>MY CAR</b>
. I ended up buying the SE V6 with a manual transmission ... in doing so, I saved about 8 thousand right away by not going with the SLE (which is nice, but I couldn't afford the luxury) and a manual transmission; if you can drive it; will also save you 1 to 2 thousand dollars
. Silver with a charcoal interior, it looks sporty and luxurious at the same time ... I also got the gold kit and a spoiler (it's best if you work those items into the price of the car so you don't have to pay up front for them)

For the price, I would definitely say that this is a good buy for your money.  Before you buy a new car, I would suggest at least taking it out for a test drive ... you might be shocked at how smooth the ride is, as well as how roomy and comfortable the interior is.  And also, if you bought the Camry Solara instead of the normal Camry, you get a sportier look and feel ... as well as a car that not many people are driving just yet.

So I say, give it a drive ... What do you have to lose? 

Thank you for your time and effort ....
