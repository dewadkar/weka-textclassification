             When it became obvious that we were all not going to fit in my old truck anymore, we decided to look for a &quot;new&quot; vehicle. We were looking for a mid-sized car but drove the Plymouth Voyager &quot;just for the heck of it&quot;. Turns out I love it. It drives pretty much like a car, except for the more upright sitting position. I'm a big guy and have always driven trucks because cars do not have enough room. This thing is different. I have lots of room. There are also alot of little things that appeal to me. Cup holders...lots of 'em. Good gas mileage (we get around 20 MPG around town with the 3.3L motor). There are some detractors, however. My van is a 1996 and now had over 100,000 miles on it. The pump in the transmission started leaking at about 95000 miles and there is a pesky intermittent electrical problem no one can seem to find. It makes the cruise control go off and occasionally makes the windshield wipers come on for one cycle. Over all, I really like this van and I thing Chrysler has another winner. I'd seriously consider another one, and I'd recommend to others who need a bit more space than a sedan to take one of these vans for a test drive. You won't be disappointed.
