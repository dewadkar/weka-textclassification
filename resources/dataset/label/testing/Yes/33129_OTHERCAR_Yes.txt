            I like to keep each of my vehicles for 200,000 miles.  Being on the GM Card bonus program for 6 years, I was planning to buy a new GM car in Dec of 2000 and had just test drove several.  But the transmission on my 92 Ford Taurus went out and the estimate of repair was $3600.  Not!! For some reason I haven't been able to get a Ford to go 200,000 without major repairs.  GM have made this easily.
So I had to purchase one quickly.  Went to several dealers and test drove several models. With the Malibu, I drove both the basic and the LS.  The LS package is about $2500.  After testing them both I decided it wasn't worth the extra.  The basic Malibu was just as comfortable and road just as well.  The dealer switched stereo systems so I could have both tape and CD. The dealer was great.  Have plenty of headroom, a comfortable seating position (important because of the arthritis in my left knee). Very smooth drive, big trunk, good steering and quiet.  So quiet that once I went into a restaurant to eat and came out to find I had left the car running and didn't even realize it.  
The Malibu is smaller then my 92 Ford Taurus and is actually a better size then the Ford.  Same size engine so I expected better fuel mileage, but was surprised to find it was the same.  30 on the road, 23 or so in town.  Have had it for 3000 miles and the only problem has been the anti-lock brake light coming on and staying on periodically.  Will get that checked when I go back to the dealer.
