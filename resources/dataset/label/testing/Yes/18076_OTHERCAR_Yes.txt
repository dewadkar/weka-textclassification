            The first car I ever had the privilege of partly paying for was my '96 Dodge Neon Expresso.  I only partly had to pay for it because I had just graduated from high school, I was sick and tired of my Dodge Shadow and had been drooling over a Neon ever since they came out, and my Dad agreed to pay half the payments every month if I felt I needed a new car that bad.  So since I was not completely independent, I got my first taste of it.

I picked out a 2-door Dodge Neon Expresso.  The Expresso package was similar to the Sport package, and I am assuming the only difference between the two may have been some graphics and engine stuff.  The Expresso package came with a very cute interior with colorful triangles all over it, a spoiler, white wheels that resembled a daisy in some ways, and of course the &quot;Expresso&quot; on either side.  What color did I go with?  Magenta!  Yes, I had a purple car and I loved it so much that I didn't care what anyone else thought about me.  My friends and I named her Skittle.

I drove Skittle for over a year before I had no choice but to get rid of her.  I'll explain why later.  In the course of that year, I made many a road trip visiting friends who were already off at college and just doing lots of your basic running around that teenagers tend to do.  Eventually this car went with me when I ventured off from home to college, and still I never had any problems with her.  I got great gas mileage with this car.  The trunk space was not enormous by any means, but it was adequate for my needs at the time.

Eventually though my parents went through some hard times and were unable to help me make my payments, and unfortunately my part-time job was not enough to help me pay bills at my apartment and make a $300 car payment, so I had no choice but to get a car with cheaper monthly payments.  I was sick to my stomach to do so, but that is life I suppose.

Just for the record, I have seen Skittle a few times since we sold her.  The lady who drives her now had the audacity to put tiny little tires and very ugly wheels on it and totally ruined the look of my Skittle.  I feel so sorry for her, but anyway....life goes on.<br><br>
