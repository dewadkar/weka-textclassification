            I am the proud owner of a 2000 Dodge Stratus SE. I bought it in March of 2001 while on the hunt for Volkswagen's very trendy New Beetle. As the salesman and I headed for the Volkswagen, my eyes fell on the sleek front-end of a pewter-colored Stratus. I knew that Dodge had a checkered past. My family owned an auto repair shop for years, and we built the business on servicing poorly made Dodge products. Despite these thoughts, I was intrigued enough to inspect the vehicle more closely. At first the sleek lines of the front seemed to clash with the chunky backside of the Stratus. I expected to see an aerodynamic finish to the car. It only took a moment to see the innovative idea behind the body-style. It was unique-not a box and not a perfectly rounded front and back. It was a marriage of several looks! 

It had been a part of a rental fleet and had been meticulously cared for by the staff. I was impressed by the spacious interior (I have three children and a husband who stands at six feet and four inches!)I immediately asked for the keys. Once inside, I was able to adjust the power seats to a perfect fit-this is always a problem for me as I am only five feet and two inches tall. As a young mother, I appreciated that the Stratus did not feel like a massive boat of a vehicle. As I drove it down the highway for the first time, I found the 2.4 L DOHC V-6 engine to be both swift and effortless. The interior was silent-outside noises were non-existent. I made the decision to buy the vehicle before I knew the price. I was pleased to find that the sticker read only $12,900.00. I never even looked at another vehicle!

Night had fallen before the ride home. The instrument panel made the car feel ultra-new with its back-lighting and digital odometer. It was easy to find everything and to see it quickly. On the way home I listened to the stereo for the first time. I admit that I was disappointed in the sound. It was loud enough but lacked the clarity of the Ford (Taurus and Explorer)stereos that I had grown accustomed to hearing.  

After a few weeks, I found that the brakes seemed weak for such a powerful vehicle and that I had to begin braking well before time to stop. Now, a year later, I need to have my brakes repaired as they are scrubbing. I have heard a few people say that it's a defect with the Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus/Plymouth Breeze front ends. My mother says it's all in how I drive.  Is it how I drive or a defect? I don't know. 

Overall, I am extremely pleased with the Stratus. I have taken it on a few trips and am glad to report that I get 29-30 mpg on the highway. The seats never hurt my back or make my rear fall asleep :) I am complimented at least once a day on the appearance of my car. The paint has held up well and shines up immediately when clean. Despite every effort of my three small children, the interior has maintained the same beauty and durability that first attracted me to the car. 

Would I recommend the 2000 Dodge Stratus SE? Yes, I would! Whether you are a student just buying your first car or an elderly person buying your last, the quality is amazing for the price you pay! Go ahead and buy a Hyundai or a Kia. See what is left in three or four years!
