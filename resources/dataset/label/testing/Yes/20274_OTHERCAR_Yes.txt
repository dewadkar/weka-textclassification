            ... and perhaps the most disconcerting thing about the GTI is the fact that it looks (and, in fact, is based on) an otherwise garden-variety Golf.  When I picked up my shiny new GTI and brought it work, everyone cocked an eyebrow curiously when they saw the diminuitive and unassuming little car that I had talked about so much.

Let's start with the basics.  The GTI is built on the Golf chassis, which was based on the Rabbit chassis, which was based on the original Scirocco chassis, which dates back to sometime around a bunch of animals on an ark.  This is a tried and proven car, and it's comforting to know that this is the product of years and years of refinement.

Americans, for some bizarre reason, don't like hatchbacks.  This is my fifth Volkswagen hatchback, and I can't say enough good things about the space these little cars have inside of them.  Ask about the time I hauled an apartment-sized washer AND dryer in the back, or moving to university and packing a pair of 18" subwoofers and everything else, in a car half the size of most of the luxobarge Grand Caravans wallowing around the highways ...

OK, back to the car.  The interior on this generation Golf/GTI is a HUGE improvement, and I'd go so far as to say that this improvement alone really makes this a world-class car, capable of competing with cars costing tens of thousands more.  Nothing feels cheap - high quality plastics and leather and metal surface abound, and it's obvious that Volkswagen wants to continue to sell cars to those of us who had cheap VW's in our younger years and want better VW's in our working-professional years.

Those who still aren't convinced should come kick the 225/45 R17 tires.  These are BIG tires - the biggest I've ever seen on a VW - and they stick to the road like crazy.  And it's a good thing - the 180 horsepower 1.8T easily managed to squawk the front tires during my initial test drive, and I wasn't even trying.  The 5-speed tranny could only be improved with a return to the more positive feeling mechanical linkages of yore, but this is little more than residual bitterness from someone who regrets having sold his '86 Scirocco.

German cars have their personality, and if you're the type of person who brags about not doing oil changes and dumping teflon oil additives into your engine, please skip the VW and check out the Ford Focus instead.  German card demand their maintenance.  Period.  Get to know some loyal VW owners and you'll immediately note that this is a different breed.  Taking care of these cars is a religion, and those who worship are rewarded with cars that can last hundreds of thousands of miles.

Don't believe me?  Price out a 5 year old Golf or Jetta and compare this to a Cavalier or Neon of similar age.  Still don't believe me?  Price out a 5 year old GTI.  These cars hold their resale.

A different car, for different people.  But definitely worth a look.
