            I bought the 2000 Eclipse in late October. I had to have the new body style and the power that comes with it.  The V6 will take you to a new level and the handling is like no other (as I have driven the new Celica, Prelude, Cougar, Civic, and a few more to compare it to) on the road.  They have made the new automatic to manual shift (sportronic) too easy and it gives rush hour drivers an excuse to play on the weekends.  They have combined the look of the sports car with the the handling of a luxury car and it paid off for Mitsubishi if you ask me.  There are a few recalls to date that are easy to get taken care of and don't take up too much time.  The first was a headlamp/windshield wiper switch and the second was a battery  cable harness.  The dealership took it in and got it out quickly.  Though the recalled parts could cause a major problem with the car, a new car buyer can hardly be upset.  Anyone who purchases a new year model should expect that they are somewhat experimental and that things will go wrong.  That is just the price you pay for wanting the newest and the nicest!   <br><br>
