            My husband and I researched car's, and test drove cars for over a year before finally deciding on a 1999 Blazer.  I love this SUV!  Compared to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, it is more roomy, a lot more comfortable, and comes with a lot more standard thing's than Jeep.  The interior is more convieniently placed (ie..the control's...) than they are in the Explorer.  We paid only $20,000.00 for our Blazer.  It is priced a lot more low than the other vehicles we test drove.  
It is a very comfortable ride.  We go on road trips typically about twice a month, and the Blazer makes it a joy!  I am very tall and the leg room is wonderful!  Also the trunk space is incredible!  We have no problems fitting everything we need and more into it!  
I have an 8 month old baby girl.  And she seems to also enjoy the ride because she is able to see out the window's easily.  The tinted windows make it easy on her eye's also!
There are a lot of available accessories for it to.  There is a huge selection of running board's, at a different range of prices.  
I highly recommend this vehicle!<br><br>
