            The Mercury Villager is a van for all people.  When I bought mine, my sisters thought I was crazy.  You see, I have no children, and mini-vans are for families they said.  This sporty take on a mini-van is for all people.  I can't tell you how many times the extra room has come in handy.  And driving it?  Well, now there's another story all together.  Once I drove this, I couldn't ride in a car anymore.  It was like riding around of 4 flat tires.  The Villager handles like a dream!! The powerful V-6 engine has the get-up-and-go of a V-8!!  Take on the highway in this powerful, sporty, and down right fun to drive vehicle. The reliability is remarkable also.  I've had mine 3 1/2 years and all I've had to do is replace the battery here recently.  I average 16 MPG in the city and 21 MPG on the highway. For the power it has, I expected those numbers to be much lower.  The ability to remove and rearrange the rear seats allows for hauling more than you'd ever realize.  When the time comes to get another vehicle, you can bet I'll be going with another Villager. I've tried to think of something not so good about the Villager, and I can't think of a thing to tell you.  It's the perfect vehicle for anyone in my opinion. Hope you enjoy the review as well as the van.
