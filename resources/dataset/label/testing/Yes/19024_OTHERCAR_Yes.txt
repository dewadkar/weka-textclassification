<b> Now let me translate this into English </b>

<b>The megapixel:</b> This is what controls the quality of your photograph.  Think of a pixel in a television or on a computer screen, the higher the pixel count the sharper the quality. Earlier 1 megapixel cameras were fine if you wanted to load images onto your computer screen and didn't plan on doing much photo-quality printing.  The problem with some of the earlier cameras is that the larger the photograph, the greater need for a camera with a high pixel count.  If you want to print a 8 by 10 photo with a 1 megapixel camera then your photos were going to be a little hazy.  Well, with this 2 megapixel camera you can really produce some nice photos.  The difference is noticable and worth some extra money.  So if your collecting photos and eventually want to print out an album you will appreciate the sharpness that a 2 megapixel camera can bring.  

<b> The digital and optical zooms </b> What this camera attempts to do is take the work out of taking a photograph.  If your a good photographer then you control all angles. Need some help? The digital zoom is here to take the pain out of focusing your shots.  Mess up? No problem just erase the picture and try again.  And let me stress that this is not complicated to operate.  Spend 30 minutes with the instruction manual and you'll be snapping photos like a pro.

<b> Neat features like motion video, and different photo settings </b>
    Ever come across a landmark that takes your breath away? Well, why not film it!  The motion video can really bring images to life.  One drawback is that their is no audio to this feature, but it still looks really cool to observe.  Play around with your photos.  Take some pictures in black and white or serpia, the choice is yours.

<b> Some things you need to know before buying </b>

    There are some drawbacks with this camera, but it mostly revolves around accessories.  First, the 8 mb storage card they give you is entirely inadequate.  Your going to want to upgrade this to a 16 or 32 mb card.  Otherwise, you will be downloading your photos too often. Also, using the serial connection on this camera is too slow.  Invest in either a reader or a USB cable to improve tour transfer rate dramatically.  Finally, it is very easy to lose this lens cap.  Be sure you find a way to secure it or you may be searching for alternatives fast.  Happy photographing.<br><br>
