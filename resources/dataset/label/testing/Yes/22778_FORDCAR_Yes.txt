            I bought my 95 Ranger Supercab in March of 95. It has been a very good truck although not trouble free. We did have a few minor warranty problems but very few. At 25,700 miles we had the wipers repaired. 

Then at 40,000 the drivers door open sensor had to be replaced. At about 59,000 miles the air conditioner compressor failed and had to be replaced. The oil pressure transducer was replaced at 61,000 and a leak of transmission fluid developed at 64,500 which was repaired by replacing the shift tower. The only other repair was a cable was replaced for the cruise control  at 76,700 miles.

 All of those repairs were covered by warranty or by the extended warranty which covered the truck to 75,000 miles. Since that the door switch has failed again.  The truck is just a bit under powered with the four cylinder engine and the five speed manual transmission. The truck has a truck like, but comfortable ride. The upholstery and interior have held up very well. At this point I would consider keeping the truck for a few more years. It now has 86,000 miles and is going strong.

Fuel mileage has averaged about 20 miles per gal. for the entire time. We have very carefully had all servicing done on the 5,000 mile interval, as is recommended for light to moderate service, The truck has been driven to and from work in the city by my wife, as well as on extended trips for vacations and weekend travel. On level interstate highways we usually get about 25 mpg.

 When we replace this truck we will consider another Ranger.<br><br>
