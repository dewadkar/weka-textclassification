                 The 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe is a carryover from last year's model, This is a solid SUV that handles very well, it can take sharp turns like a car. It's very quiet, in fact, for me, a little too quiet. After about a month I decided to put a flowmaster performance muffler on it. NOW I think it's perfect. Keep in mind that this is considered to be a full size SUV, so gas mileage is about 17 mpg average. (with the flowmaster it's been a little better, I'd say about 19.) With the LT model there's plenty of little gadgets to play with. Captain seats in the front are great. The sound system is wonderful. The ride is beautiful, incredibly smooth. I highly recommend this vehicle. I chose 2wd simply because I'm a city gal and don't really need 4wd. Prior to purchasing this vehicle, I had test-driven a Ford Expedition, a Ford Excursion, a Dodge Durango, and a Nissan Pathfinder. I was most impressed with the Tahoe because of it's size, handling and overall value.
