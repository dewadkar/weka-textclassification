            Last summer I bought my first car.  I really had my hopes on an expensive set of wheels, but when I found out how much most cars cost I had a change of mind.  A cheap car with seats in it now sounded good to me.  I ended up buying a 90 Plymouth Acclaim.  

The car is wonderful, except for a few exceptions.  It now has 135,000 miles on it and is still running great.  The car is loaded with handy features like power windows, power seats, power locks, fog lights, and foldable seats.  It even has safety features like airbags.  The car has exceptional acceleration power.  It's loaded down with a V6.  For a family car that's pretty good.

I've had the car for almost a year now and have been trying it almost two hours a day.  I use it to commute back and forth to college everyday.  It's affordable and very comfortable to ride in.  The only major problem I ran across was a faulty made transmission.  From what I hear transmission problems are a common occurrence for Plymouth Acclaim's.  Other than that I've had no complaints.

From commuting to school to hauling groceries, I highly recommend the purchase of an Acclaim.
