            1992 Taurus LX 3.8liter V6 4 spd Auto Sedan. 

The interior could've used more insulation, especially the rear seat section, and lack of head rest makes it less safe. But it's wide enough to have 2 child seats on the left and middle, and still have space for one adult at the right. This is a middle class body car. The cup holder is a space taker, useless. Coin case is ok. Center armrest is not as useful as it looks. I prefer a long deep center compartment with the lid to cover the content instead of exposed cassettes all over the shallow and uncovered center console. I don't like the transmission shifter on the floor. I would've preferred it came with column shifter lever for this type of cars. And it lacks the 2nd gear lock for hill climbing. You have to sacrifice with 3rd gear lock and push the gas to shift it to 2nd, and once you relieve the pressure, it shifts up to 3rd gear, which is too high... Annoying. 
I found out that many Ford cars and trucks are the same way... 

The ride is really cushy which is the main reason I bought this in the first place, but the cornering is somewhat on the softer side, but once you get the hang of it, it turns on a sharp line, and doesn't miss it. The key is to find the right angle of steering for a corner and keep it steady, and don't jerk it. Although, the steering play is a bid too much (about 1 inch after the replacement of joints) and is not adjustable. You would probably need the joints replaced for excessive play. Have it checked by a mechanic. Engine has not much power, but as any American V6, a great Torque to pull this heavy car ahead of traffic at ease, and at the same time, easy on fuel economy (24mpg average, 20city-33hwy mpg range). 

Trunk is large, but the bottom line of the lid is so high above the bumper, so it takes an effort to lift up a luggage into it. Too bad. 

Check on the vacuum leak which is often the cause of rough idling. They originally came with cheap vacuum hoses which crack and leak, so check them before you call it a quit. 
I had a water pump and the belt tensioner quit on me around 80,000 miles. About $700.00 expense at a Ford dealer. CV boots had to be replaced once. Otherwise, a great car for aging 1992 vehicle, if you find a properly maintained Taurus. There are couple of older Taurus in my neighborhood, and still running great. They will cost more, but you might want to use the metalic brake pads for greater braking effect for money as Taurus Sedan comes with rear DRUM brakes. (LX model has all wheel anti lock brakes) 
They work fine. But keep in you mind that it is a heavy car.
