            When I began my search for SUV's I could see that it was gonna take time and determination.  I drove every SUV on the market today, from brand new to up to 3years old.  I knew whatever I was going to buy I had to shop around for price, considering with all the SUV's on the market they can have huge differences in prices.  I drove any of the larger ones, such as the Dodge Durango to a smaller Ford Explorer Sport 2 door.  I like alot of them, but when it came to price, option, and size I had to pick the NIssan Xterra.  It dosent even compare with the Honda CRV which is a 4 wheel drive station wagon with less room than an Accord. And how cool do those look anyway? About as cool as a Suzuki Sidekick or a Chevy Tracker. Which may be cool if your a wanna be yuppie that dosent have enough money for a real SUV. I couldnt have asked for more in my Xterra. It is very nice but I dont have to worry about getting into it if I am wet or dirty because it is durable and built for active people.  I can drive my Xterra from scuba diving or snowskiing right to a formal occasion.  It has functionality and class.  Definetely made for those of us that are young, have good jobs and active lifestyles.  I drive 24 miles to work everyday and it is quiet. The stereo is great, with a CD and tape. The shift on the fly is perfect for 4wheel conditions.  Lots of leg room. My boyfriend is 6'1&quot; and he loves to drive it.  The engine even has color coded caps for things that you need to check ie. oil, transmission fluid, wiper fluid, etc. I have a friend who also has one that has one kid, and they love it! lots of room, stain resistant seats and he can see out of the back which is very important for little kids.  Since the seats are up higher in back anyone from small child to grown adult can ride comfortably and see whats going on outside. <br><br>
