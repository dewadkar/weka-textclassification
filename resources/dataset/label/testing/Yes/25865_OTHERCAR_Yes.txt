            Jeep's are THE original SUV.  No other has as much history as do the Jeeps, the closest being the Toyota Landcruiser.  But the Landcruiser has distanced itsself from it's roots and become a full size luxury SUV.  The Jeeps have stayed very similar to their original designs and still hold the same purpose.  
The Cherokee is the middle of the Jeep lineup, between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee.  The 4.0L Powertech I-6 (190hp, 225lb-ft torque) is a great motor for the Cherokee, but the 2.5L 4-banger (125hp, 150lb-ft torque) can't get out of it's own way.  Anyone who buys a Cherokee should spring for the 4.0L, the extra power's worth it.  I think Jeep should offer the Grand Cherokee's 4.7L V-8, that would be one great SUV!  The Jeep is capable on or off road, in 2 or 4 wheel drive.  The Cherokee is available in SE, Sport, Classic, and Limited trim.  Everything on these SUV's is great and with a little modification (mainly tires and suspension) will be the best off roader you can buy.  For anyone looking for a smaller SUV, I recommend the Cherokee over the Ford Explorer, Chevy Blazer/ GMC Jimmy, Toyota 4Runner, Honda Passport, Isusu Rodeo, and Nissan Pathfinder.  There definately is only one!
