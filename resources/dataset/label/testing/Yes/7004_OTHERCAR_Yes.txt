            Okay...  I have a confession, and I must ask forgiveness and understanding from all who read this.  Once, I was a die-hard, Range Rover loyalists.  I at one time almost considered myself a loyal subject of her Majesty - The Queen of England.  Afterall, I was driving a car with her's and her husband Coat of Arms on it's name.

Then, alas.  I defected.  It was one fine Sunday, I dropped by my local Toyota dealership and they rolled out a brand new 2001, Toyota Landcruiser.  I initially sneered at it and told them that nothing on God's good Earth could compare to the prowess on road and off road of my Royal Mudrucker - The Range Rover.  Then falling to temptation, salesmanship or excellent persuasion from the Sales Person - I went for a test drive.

The sales person encouraged me to take the Cruiser to the limit - &quot;Test it&quot;, he said.  And test it I did.  Woe is me, I should have stayed at home.  I now sit with a brand new, 2001 and Toyota Landcruiser parked in my driveway.  The Queen shall have my head, but the Emperor shall crown me a Samurai (or something).

First I took the Cruiser on the road.  It took me a while to accept that I had a Lexus V8 under the hood.  It was so deceptively quite and smooth.  I would be at full throttle before I really noticed a rise in decible levels.  And the power- oh man, the power.  In first gear it was a little sluggish, but once it conquered the car's inertia, it was OFF!!!  I felt like I was driving a turbo powered Sherman tank.  There I was on the freeway, cruising along at 65 MPH, feeling like I was in an elevated luxury automobile.  AND MAN IT IS SMOOTH !!!!

The interior, though it does not have all the neat toys I liked in the Range Rover, it is luxurious to say the least.  Now keep in mind that I was about to buy a 2001 Range Rover - or at least was considering leasing a new car at the time.  However, her Majesty's Mudrucker cost at least $10,000 more than The Emperor's Chariot.  So, it made me think a bit here.

Anyway, I said to myself.  I am a true SUV driver, I not only want to conquer LA roads and feel like a King above all others in traffic, I want to conquer Mt. Everest as well - well, at least be able to go up into the San Bernardino mountains and make it back in one peace.

So, I took the test cruiser up to a special spot I have which provides enough challenge to any self respecting SUV.  Many a passenger of mine had screamed for me to head back to level Terra Firma.  As I approached the first incline, I put the Cruiser into low gear, and selected low range on the 4WD selector.  I approached with caution, positioned the wheels and tapped the pedal.  Before I could spell V8, the car was at the top.  Now wait a minute!  Only my Range Rover could so effortlessly climb this incline.  This place had put many an Expedition to shame.  But, there she was sitting pretty at the top.  I accepted this as a fluke, I got lucky, or the rising Sun took kindly to the Cruiser.

So, I tried it again, and again and again...sometimes stopping midstream to really test the car.  Every single time, the results were the same.  The only time I almost lost it was when I applied too much power and the Cruiser wanted to take off fromthe ledge.  I tell you, I felt like I could knock over a full grown elephant with the power this machine had.  You just pointed it and it charged up that incline.

So, with that done, I came up with my next devious plan.  On the descent, the road is quite interesting.  It will put to test any SUV's suspension articulation abilities.  The Range Rover is capable of leaning sideways up to and a bit above 35 degrees.  YES !!!  You got it, I was about to test the Cruiser ability to do this.  My sales person - even though at this point had gotten out of the vehicle, assured me that the Cruiser would make minced meat out of this part of my devious obstacle course.  He assured me that The Emperor's Chariot would be as sure footed as a Mountain Goat.  

So, I proceeded.  Down the Cruiser came, and oh boy, I wish I could show you the ways the wheels seemed to find their way down.  I had it in low gearing again and this time, with the differential locked.  When we got to the leaning tower it Pisa part, I stopped and held it there.  The Cruiser perched like it was another rock on the hill - impressive to say the least.  Even the sales person at this point had a concerned frown on his forehead.  He assured me the car was at least at a 30 degree angle base on sight judgement.  In the car, I had to hold a hand rail to prevent me falling into the passenger seat, so I believed him.

And so, there I was.  Face flushed with excitement, heart pounding with adrenaline.  Oh my goodness I realized, I may have found a competitor to my Mudrucker.

Needless to say, I bought the Landcruiser and have not regretted it.  I have found it rather easy to drive, it has gobs of space in it and now I can impress up to seven people with my new extra seat in the back.  The steering column does not shudder excessively through bumps like the Range Rover does, it is so much more refined.

I did consider the Lexus 470, but put alongside each other and comparing entry costs, I did not see enough value there.

I will again write and seek forgiveness from you who read my Range Rover review.  HE HAS DEFECTED!!!! The good people of the village cried, off with his head.  HE HAS SEEN THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN !!!!  So cried the other people from the other town - crown him an Emperor's Samurai.
