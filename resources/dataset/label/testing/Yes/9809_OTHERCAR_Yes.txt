            I was looking primarily for a very reliable, long-term, everyday car to replace my Civic. The loyal Civic had replaced an antiquated and trusty Accord. Entering the car market, I consequently saw myself as a confirmed Honda owner. For my work, I've also driven Mercedes E class, Opel, and other European cars that handle very well. Reliability, value, and handling were therefore my priorities, in that order.

My initial thinking was to get a slightly-used car, or, if I could find one, a new car with my "essentials" (AC and CD -- I don't like power controls) if within my limited budget (around $12K). After a couple test drives, however, I came to believe that Honda has become much too complacent: their newer models have flat, unimaginative interiors that feel cheap and cost far too much. Ergo, I decided to consider other reliable Japanese cars for the first time. I looked at several makes, some of which I mention below, and found the Protege best suited my needs. I won't get  technical -- I'm not interested in shop talk, just value.

The 2003 Corolla is perhaps the best in its class, but the models I saw were above my price range by several grand. All told, I thought it a great "family car." Cheaper than the Civic, and with far more amenities. Since it cost more than I wanted to spend, I moved on. If I wanted to spend another $3-4K, I'd have probably bought it. 

I only looked at slightly-used Sentras ('99-'00), so I can't fairly comment on the new models. My family has two excellent Nissan trucks that have proven their reliability. The compact sedans I tested, however, didn't seem to match the Corolla or Protege in terms of interior. I remember asking myself: "What's this compartment for?" and similar questions. The Sentras had decent but uninspiring handling.

After looking at other makes, two friends with late '90s Proteges demanded I consider the Mazda. I hadn't thought about Mazdas before, but a couple of test-drives quickly changed my opinion.  I was very impressed with the 2002 model.

First, I could afford to buy a new, not used, one, given my price limitations. The 2003's had already filled the lot, and the dealer wanted to get rid of last year's model. For the price I paid to get a new 2002 Protege, I could only get a Civic with 20-40K miles -- several years off the car's life. Given Mazda's reputation for reliability, and the fact that with a new car I got the color and extras of my preference, the choice eventually became obvious. Furthermore, the basic DX version,  with the "convenience package" (AC, CD, floormats) and the respectable warranty (3 years/50K miles), suited my needs.

Finally, I wasn't concerned with the rather bumpy ride. I don't have a family, so the trade-off for superior handling wasn't troublesome (handling is the one trait I concede to most small European cars, and the Protege compares favorably). The car has plenty of pep (I got the 5-speed, and the 2 liter motor is standard), and outperforms my girlfriend's 2003 Corolla (also 5-speed). The Toyota is roomier, but otherwise the interiors are closely matched in terms of amenities, like map lights. I still haven't found a way to store trash on longer drives, apart from the small ashtray. But the car's good looks, handling, reputed reliability, and price pushed me to buy it through a process of elimination. 

To sum up, I've only had the car for a short time, but I enjoy it and feel very good about my decision. The CD sounds clear, the AC and heater work well, and the radio reception is better than my Civic's (which I still have). I think I got a wonderful car for the price, and the Protege is incredibly fun to drive in the mountains where I live. (I  sheepishly admit keeping pace with a shamelessly irresponsible BMW driver on a twisty mountain road the other day. Totally out of character.)

Some small complaints: My gas mileage on the Civic was noticeably better than the Protege's. I have also noticed that in stop-and-go traffic or parking lots the first gear is unpredictable and jerky. It is not easy to "coast" at very low speed, and it took me a while to get the knack of it. On the highway, however, the car hums. The manual transmission shifts very smoothly (again, it beats the Corolla on this).

Another minor criticism: the DX comes with a rather chintzy speedometer that indicates only even numbers (40, 60,...). The crucial speeds, such as 55 and 65, aren't clearly marked, which can make monitoring your rate of travel relative to speed limits tricky and uncertain. A minor irritant (but potentially costly).

Final gripes: The cloth covering the seats is handsome, but I'm not sure of its durability over the long haul. (But what do you expect from a base model?) I purchased a cover for the driver's seat. The cup-holders are a bit small, too.

The Protege has an intangible benefit, however, that's fun and gives the ol' ego a little boost: strangers like to comment on the its sporty styling. Rather rare phenomenon, I imagine, among most compacts.

Ultimately, the opinion I have five years from now will count the most. But from what I've seen, felt, and paid, I'm optimistic that my Protege was a very good buy.
