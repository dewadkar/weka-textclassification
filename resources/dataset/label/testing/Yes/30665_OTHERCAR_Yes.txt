            In 1999 my wife and I purchased an off lease 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  It has been the best car we have ever owned.  Living in north east California we have faced vastly changing road and weather conditions from:  ice, snow, slush, back country expeditions, long distance normal driving etc.  The full time computerized 4x4 never fails to adjust quickly to slippery conditions and has been the easiest 4x4 I have ever driven in the snow.  I keep waiting for it to slip, but it never does.  Long distance hauls have proven to be very comfortable.  The full time 4x4 has not impacted our gas mileage and we get from 18 to 22 mpg, depending on terrain, with the 318 V-8 engine.  This power train has plenty of power for highway use, passing, up hill driving, and towing.  We were down to deciding between the Ford Explorer of the same year and the Cherokee.  What swayed me was when I lifted both the hoods and looked at the engines.  The Explorer was a nightmare.  Being a &quot;do-it-myselfer&quot;, I shrieked when I saw that the Ford's spark plugs would probably have to be changed from under the car.  I have changed all 8 plugs on the Cherokee in 10 minutes!  Other maintenance is just as easy.  My only complaint has been the cost of the parts, but I guess that's pretty much a nightmare for all the newer cars.  Our next car will also be a Cherokee.<br><br>
