            First of all I would like to note that despite the title, it is a 2003 BMW M3, I could not choose the proper year from the list. But on with the review...if you have a good 50 grand to spend on a car I would highly recommend this car. I have only owned it for a few weeks, but it has given me the power and workmanship I was promised. 
        The 2003 model had been slightly upgraded from the 2002. It now had a DVD based navigation system, as apposed to the CD based. It also has an optional aluminum trim, and you can now have the navigation system in the front with the CD player above it, unlike the 2002, which said that if you had a navigation system you could only have the 6-CD changer in the trunk. Other than that, it is basically the same. It has the same speed, same shape, and overall the same look.
         Now onto performance. (The 2002 M3 has the same capabilities, so if you want more details of more information that I did not include you can refer to the 2002 BMW M3 reviews in reference to the driving experience.)
         I bought the M3 with almost every option you could get on it. This included the following; Topaz blue Metallic with Black interior, Navigation, 19' rims, premium package, SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox) Bi-Xenon headlights, Harmon/Kardon advanced sound system, and park distance control. The MSRP says Approximately $45,000, but with as many options as I chose it came to about $60,000, so if you want a fully loaded M3 expect to pay a lot more that $45,000. But I soon found out that the money was well worth it when I went for my first drive. Now before hand when I was on the waiting list my friends told me that getting the SMG was a "wimp's manual" but I soon proved them wrong. Though it has no clutch and people argue that it is not really manual, it has the same affect. You can shift with either the paddles on the steering wheel or the shifter in the center (up and down, not the regular manual shifter). It is just as fast if not faster in SMG than in manual, and it is even more fun to drive. Since this car can hug turns and take an easy left at over 60mph you can really break this car in and it can handle you it no matter how tough you are on it. The competition inspired brakes stop it from 60-0 in 2.6 seconds! That is incredible, and extremely impressive. It feels like under 2 seconds when you execute the braking power, and it is even smooth when you are doing so. The one problem is that you don't realize that you are going too fast. Because of the excellently smooth ride you could be doing 90 on a highway and mot realize it. Also, keep an eye out for the police because this is the type of car that they like to pull over, and me being 17 is a bit pretentious and the police don't like young drivers. (Rightfully) But all and all this is most definitely the super car that is just incredible.
