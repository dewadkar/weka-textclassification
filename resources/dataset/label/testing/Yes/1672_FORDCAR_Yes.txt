            We replaces our 1992 Ford Explorer with a 2000 Ford Excursion because the transmission in the Explorer couldn't handle our new trailer.  We shopped around and looked at both mid-sized and larger SUV's and decided that the Ford Excursion gave us the best value.  We love the smooth ride and excellent towing capabilities of this SUV.  There is still acceleration power when towing the 9600 pound trailer.  The ride is stable and we feel safe and comfortable.  The interior is roomy.  Our 6'2&quot; son rides in the third seat with plenty of leg room.  The third seat is the most comfortable bench seat I have ever used.  The gas mileage is better than we expected, but we do not use this for everyday commuting--only weekend trailer and travel (out of state without the trailer).  The down-side is that it is hard to park this wide 19' long vehicle.  

This vehicle is perfect for people who love to pull a large trailer (up to 10000 pounds) and who regularly travel with four or more adults.<br><br>
