            This camera is a lot of fun and easy to use.  The part I like best is that it saves the image to a floppy disk inside of the camera.  After using the camera all you have to do is pop the floppy into the computer.

You can save 30-40 black and white images to a floppy, but if it has a lot of colors like a flower garden expect to only get about 25 images per disk.

The camera only takes 640 by 480 pixel images, which is a nice image for web and computer display.  However, if you want a nice printed photo, this resolution will only look good if the image is about 2x1.5 inches (printing at 300 dpi).  To get a camera to take good pictures for print, expect to spend a couple thousand.  Even then, you are probably better off using your regular camera and film and then scanning it into your computer with a scanner.<br><br>
