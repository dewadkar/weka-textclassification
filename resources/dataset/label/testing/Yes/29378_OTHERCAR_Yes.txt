            I believe the Ferrari shown here is one of 3 cars built in 1956 for the Lemans circuit.  In 1981 my father was hired by a Grand Rapids Michigan attorney to bring back to life a car that was literally in baskets.  At that time I believe he paid 10,000 dollars for the car in that condition.  

I spent the better part of 2 years with my father painstakingly reworking every part right down to the last nut and bolt.  His attention to detail was incredible, and at the time I was just 15 years old.  He was a genius in my eye, and those years with him were among the best of my memory. 

Unfortunately the owner of the car did not allow any photos to be kept from the awesome collection of photos that my uncle took of it during the restoration.  All I have is my memories, and I never got to see it when it was in show condition due to this owner being a little on the weird side.  Now dad has passed away unexpectedly and I find myself wanting to track down the new owners and possibly visit with the car that was such a huge part of my life with my dad back then.

Through internet searches I have been able to find that the car apparently sold in 1997 for over $455,000.  But I have been unable to find anything else on it.  If anyone has any information on this car please email me at russliscomb@aol.com  It would be greatly appreciated.
