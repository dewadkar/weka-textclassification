            I've had my '99 Protege almost a year now and have been thrilled with it. I did loads of research before buying and found that this was at least a grand cheaper than a similar Toyota and two grand less than a similar Honda. Also, for just over 14K, I got a CD player, power everything, cranking A-C, and all the safety features. The back seat folds down for those important visits to Home Depot and the seats are really comfortable--especially the multi-adjustable driver's seat.

I average around 32 miles per gallon and not even a wierd noise yet after 16,000 miles--runs perfectly.

My only complaint is that when I took it in for a 15,000 mile servicing, it cost close to $300, basically for just checking everything over and replacing the wiper blades. I guess they didn't make much off the sale, especially with 3.9% financing, so they make it up with the service visits.<br><br>
