            I absolutely love mine.

I love it because it's tiny and I can take it anywhere, it fits in my tiny purse.  

The battery life is really good.

The optical zoom produces really nice pictures, but the digital zoom is awful.  Every time I use it the image comes out totally smudged and lo-resolution.  I never use the digital zoom anymore.

I wish it came w/ a leather carrying case.  I had to buy a carrying case off of ebay.

The buttons on the back are so tiny, that even though I highly recommended the camera to others, some could not buy it based solely on the button-size.  If you have large hands, forget it.

It takes nice, clear, crisp photos, even up close (like 3").

Metal case is very durable.

One problem is that if you want to surprise someone w/ a picture, or catch something quickly in action, it takes a full second or more for it to turn on (to turn on, shutter to open, lens to pop out).  So if you just saw Elvis walking down the street, forget it.  You won't catch him.  If you are planning on taking photos at an event, you'll want to leave it on, which can a) eat the battery, b) be risky of damaging it (if you bump the lens on something), and also, it'll turn itself off after a while.

One of the cool things is that you can buy a USB card reader for it.  Then you just pop out the memory card, and pop it into the tiny card reader (about the size of a mouse).  Then, the card reader shows up like a drive on your computer and then you can easily just drag the photos off the memory card onto your hard drive.  I love that.  The cord that comes with it is great, I just really love the card reader that I bought aftermarket.

Overall I love it.  The benefits of it way outweigh any drawbacks for me.
