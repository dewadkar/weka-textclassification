            This is my second review of the CRX for my new 1991 DX. A little history about my CRX ownership... I originally had an '84 DX that I bought a few months after I had turned 16. It was only $500. The guy said there were some things that needed to be fixed, but the total amounted to only $900 including the price of the car. So I bought it. Little did I know that for two months, there was something that broke on the car every week. One week I needed a new master cylinder. The next I needed a new turn signal switcher. The next week was a new clutch. Needless to say, it wasn't the greatest car, but I still loved it just because it was a CRX. I recently sold it and purchased my &quot;new&quot; (it's new to me) 1991 CRX DX. I got it for a dealership, negotiated the price down, and even got a new factory moonroof installed for free! Now on with the review...

The Honda CRX is one of the most versatile and one of the most fun cars I've ever driven. It's quite sporty looking, and it drives and handles like a real sports car. When I say real, I mean sports cars like Miatas, RX7s, and the like. The difference with this car is, it has Honda's reliability history, and it won't kill you with a high pricetag.

First off, the ride. I've driven a lot of sports cars, and they all had a pretty rough ride. Not so with the CRX. Each bump you feel is lessened so much that it feels like you ran over a pillow or something. It's pretty quiet too, but road noise gets sort of loud above 80 MPH, even more so with the windows/sunroof open. But what's a little noise when you have an overall good car? The seats are firm and supportive, but when I drove to the ocean (a four hour drive) my back felt just fine. It has a built in lumbar support in the seats, it even supports your neck and head when you sit all the way back.

As far as driving it goes, imagine you're driving a car that could do anything you wanted it to do in a split second. Do a U-Turn in the middle of the road? No problem. Stop on a dime? Easy! 4 wheel disc brakes equip this baby all the way around.

The car (for its original price) comes with a lot of stuff inside. There are a lot of little dials and switches to play with. Every model (HF, DX, Si) had a tachometer. The only model really lacking in gear was the HF. The DX and Si both have rear cargo covers, 3 spoke racing steering wheels, and rear wipers. The Si has a sunroof already in it, and nicer racing seats.

If you're like I am, and your friend owns a '91 CRX, you'll probably say, &quot;Wow, what year is that, '95?&quot; Not true, my car illiterate friend! Your friend will now inform you that it is, in fact, a '91! Amazing! Just looking at the interior/exterior design, you'd think Honda somehow traveled to the future and saw what would be cool, then came back and put that into their cars. Seriously though, look at other 1991 models: the Ford Escort? Boxy and ugly. Toyota Corolla/Camry? They look like mid-80's cars. Even a Lexus ES300 (a very nice, expensive car) didn't look as good! Honda has some of the best design people in the industry, and it shows.

But Otterizer! What about cargo room? Hey, if you need room for cargo, you've come to the right place. Err, the right car, rather. Even though it's a hatchback, having no back seat sort of has an advantage. You've got a huge area to fill with all your junk. Looking for a good car to have a roadtrip in? Look no further! Just pack your food and clothes into the hatch, and you could easily live for a week or two. Not only that, but you could have a car carrier on top. Also, since these bad boys have enough power to tow a small trailer, you could use of of those miniature U-Haul deals to put stuff in.

Ok ok, like I said in my review of the 1990 Accord EX, (<a href='/auto-review-4748-9F84F1F-391E5525-prod3'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-4748-9F84F1F-391E5525-prod3</a>) a teenager's number one concern is the sound. So how does the stock sound system add up? Well, the headunits for all earlier Hondas are, shall we say, junky. None offered enough watts/amps to have a really killer sound system, so you're probably going to put in one of your own. (I bought a nice Panasonic CD player.) The speakers however, sound very nice. They have just the right mixture of bass and treble. Some might not even need a subwoofer in their car because the speakers sound decent enough by themselves. However, I really want a sub, so I'm gonna get one. :)

What it all boils down to, is this is a very nice car. I'm not saying it's &quot;good for the money I paid&quot; or something like that - It's a nice car. With 113,000 miles on it, the only thing it's ever had done was new brake pads and a new timing belt. That's it! If you want a good reliable car, any Honda will fit the job. But if you want a good reliable car that's also extremely fun to drive, look no further than the CRX. (and not just the 1991 model, any year is just as cool!)<br><br>
