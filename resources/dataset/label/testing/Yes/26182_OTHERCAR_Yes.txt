The 1990 4 Runner was one of the newer model 4Runner giving rise to the current model.  While the body is not exactly the same as the current model it bears a close resemblance.  I have had my 1990 4Runner for over 5 years now and am very pleased with its performance.  It has held up especially well on long distance trips and excursions to snow country.  I have used the 4 wheel drive on several occasions and found it easy to shift and simple to drive.  The sound system is very good for a &quot;truck&quot;  type vehicle and the CD player never skips, even on rough ground.  

My only complaint about the car is the poor gas mileage and lack of power when needed on freeway on ramps and when passing.

If you are considering an early 90's version of the 4 Runner I would stick with 89,90,91 and possibly 92 models because the metal used during manufacturing appears to be heavier and stronger.  (Less dents!)
