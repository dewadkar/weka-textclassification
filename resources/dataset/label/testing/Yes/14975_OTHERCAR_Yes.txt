            I'm Area Coordinator for the chapters in my county of the M.O.M.S. Club (a national organization for at-home moms).  When we produced our state luncheon last year, National sent us their Digital camera to take pictures to be posted in the online newsletter.  I had never used one before, but had heard about them, and was very interested.  Within 5 minutes I had figured out the basics of taking and editing pictures!  Within 15 minutes, I had learned how to move the pictures from the disk into an email.  And shortly thereafter, I uploaded the pictures from the disk to my FTP space on AOL to use on my Ebay sales.  

This camera is extremely easy to use, very versatile with its onscreen options, and affordable.  It has many features such as deleting pictures from the disk (allows you to get rid of the bad shots), quality of picture (email, standard, fine), and a timer so you can take pictures of yourself!

The Sony Mavica takes great quality pictures, too.  I was able to get an extreme close up of my son's 1 inch Pokï¿½mon figures to sell on eBay.  The pictures came out clear and bright and very detailed. I took a picture of a hurricane that passed through our area to send to the local TV station.  I've taken birthday pictures, circus pictures, family photos, and shots of my dog to send via email.  I use it constantly!

I highly recommend the Sony Mavica.  It's pictures are quality, the price is affordable, and it's a name you can trust!<br><br>
