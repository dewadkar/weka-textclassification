            We got our 99 Kia this time last year...a car for the wife, had to be cheap, but decent.

Well, sure, it�s had its problems, but overall, a good car.

We've had the bad:
1) broken sunshade - warranty
2)loose body molding - warranty
3)vacuum leak - warranty
4) I think the brakes are warped, but my wife disagrees...grrr
5) wipers not really wiping - recall.
(everything taken care of in one visit, except the brakes.)

Also, a nice lady with a shopping cart rammed it - and right after we got that fixed, she did it again! Neither is Kia's fault, I mean, its a bright red car, for goodness sake! You can't miss it...err...as I guess runaway shopping cart lady is proving true...

We've had the Good:

1) great gas mileage
2) zippy, tight on corners
3) good commuter car
4) surprisingly good winter traction

We've had the things you only learn from use of any product
1) I will smack my elbow into the plastic arm rest at least once when I speed shift into second
2) I will smack my head on the trunk, because a roomy trunk with a low hanging lid is a mixed blessing. Yes, that�s my hair hanging from the lock.
3) I will hit my shins opening the door
4) I will hit my head on the corner of the door.
5) Men hate the stereo, women like it. Don�t ask me why that is. At least it doesn�t hurt.

Um, granted, I'm a klutz, but this car is just made to put the hurt on me.

Anyway, compared to my Honda Civic, no it�s not as tight, nor as comfy. But it gets the wife around, is reliable, and that Mazda engine is zippy. I like driving it if I'm just cruising around town. Plus, unlike my Civic, there aren't thousands of 'em in the parking lot at work, so it�s a lot easier to find.

Its hacked a Minnesota winter, that alone should prove any cars worth.

Hey, you get what you pay for...and yet, even for the price, the Kia is actually better then I expected. It�s a good second car. Besides, it wont hurt so bad when shopping cart lady smacks it a third time...at least she's leaving my Honda alone!

I'd buy another one. Just not for me; I bruise easily.
