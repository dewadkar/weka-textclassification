            We bought a used 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan totally on a whim. I kept telling my husband I needed a 4 door vehicle of some type. It was hard getting our baby in and out of a 2 door blazer. We set out to buy a used  4 door Blazer or some other type of SUV. Car-Max didn't have any in stock. So, on we went to the mini-vans. I did not want a mommy mobile but that's what I got.

I must say I was quite surprised when I drove the Grand Caravan, It was wonderful. It drives smoothly, lots of room and it also has two sliding doors for the passengers. Our Caravan is completley loaded (except for leather) and I wouldn't have it any other way.  We also chose one with captian's chairs for the middle seats instead of the bench. I believe these are more comfortable and you have more room. It is nice to drive around in a vehicle that you enjoy driving and are happy to own.

We have not had one problem with our van in the 16 months we have owned it.  One word of advice have a mechanic check out any used vehicle you are buying for possible problems. My husband is a mechanic and checked out every inch of the van before  we signed the papers.

I would recommend the Grand Caravan to anyone. Although, there are always some bad ones out there no matter the type of vehicle. Check out what you are buying. Get the most for your money and Get something that is useful , practical , in your price range and something you will enjoy driving.

I love my mommy mobile. The only negative comment I have is the color, teal. Gross just about sums it up. 

When you are considering a mini-van used or new go test drive a Dodge Grand Caravan and see what you think.<br><br>
