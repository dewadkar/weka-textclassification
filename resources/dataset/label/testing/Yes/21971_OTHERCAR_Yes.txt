            The 89-91 Turbo II's were a slight improvement on the 87-88 TII.  I had a '90 from summer 97 to summer 99.  The seats are awesomely supportive in corners, it turns on a dime, acceleration is phenomenal (mmm, turbo boost), awesome neutral handling.  I really miss that car (I have a 99 Maxima now).  

Unfortunately I bought my rex from some guys here in Austin that were a little over-zealous about upgrading my car for me.  It started with a Racing Beat full Turbo-back exhaust system.  They didn't understand that the much-less-restrictive exhaust would raise the horse power from around 200 to nearly 250, but only at the price of dependability.  The turbo boost increased from 4.5 psi stock to almost 12 psi!!!! I didn't know the difference (except that it was faster), but apparently it was destroying my engine.  So after replacing the engine TWICE at over $3000 a pop, the third engine started showing signs of failure after 20,000 miles, so I sold the car back to them for a big loss.  

If you have a turbo II or a 3rd gen twin turbo, DON'T MESS WITH THE EXHAUST, unless you absolutely know the other upgrades that necessarily need to go along with your new exhaust system... fuel pump, larger injectors, fuel controller, boost controller, whatever else.  Please!  Know what you're doing.
