            Having owned the 95, 98 and now the 2000 740iL, subtle refinements have made the current model best bust still shy of perfect. The a/c controls (classically German... somewhat over-engineered) now feature a (welcomed)single MAX button which instantly adjusts both driver and passenger controls. I wish a separate blower with fan speed and temp. control could operate the rear (back seat passengers) a/c vent.  And the general a/c controls are still a bit complicated, though better than the 95 and 98 models.

The electronics are more stable than ever, and now the master door lock button on the shift console works whether driver door is open or closed... finally.  

The navigation system needs improvement still... the Hertz NeverLost by Magellan is still superior and easier to program... it seems more logical for streets to move (Hertz) rather than the automobile icon moving (BMW) as you drive.  Touchscreen or simplified destination programming would be nice. The screen does not indicate which radio station is tuned while using the navigation system, though visible in separate in-dash LED while tuning.  Glare sometimes precludes easy viewing of the over-evident screen... a drop-down wood panel to hide the screen would be welcomed.  Abbreviations and icons that identify computer/navigation controls are difficult to understand.

The up/down radio tuning controls on the wheel now advance to driver-defined station presets (instead of seeking from the whole band range as in the 95 and 98 models).

The suspension/drive characteristics on the 2000 are a radical change (improvement) vs. my 1998.  The car is far tighter, most appreciated on gusty highway trips... a real pleasure on the road. The 1998 required lot's of baby-sitting of the wheel on windy days... the car had a propensity to wander... the 2000 is far more precise, drives more like a sports car (I have standard equipment, not sports package)... all-in-all, I adore the improved handling... though it took a couple of weeks to get reacquainted.

The seats are second to none... BMW &quot;comfort seats&quot; are just that. Far away more comfortable vs. the new Mercedes S, especially for bigger persons.  The 740 is supremely comfortable, particularly enjoyable on road trips.

I still wish CD's could be inserted individually while driving (currently only trunk access cassette). The various computers (stopwatch, trip and mileage counters, etc.) are more that I need or desire. The 2000 windshield appears to have clear (no tint) areas seemingly aligned for a a radar detector and garage opener (even though a separate BMW system replaces typical transmitters). The auto rain detection wiper system works flawlessly.  Impressive.<br><br>
