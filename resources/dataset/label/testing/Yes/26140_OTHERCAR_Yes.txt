            Since there is little bad to say about this car, lets get it out of the way...  The cup-holders are situated awkwardly between the armrest and the shifter.  The cruise "on-off" button is inconveniently located on the lower dash control panel. There is no imput jack on the stereo (sorry, no MP3s). There, now onto the good.

I drive luxury Lincoln Town Cars and limos for my limo service in Minneapolis.  The Sonata LX has many of the same luxury options as the luxury cars I am used to driving.  Some of these features are:  Climate control, drivers side power seat, leather, cruise, ABS/traction control, CD AND Tape, lumbar support, auto head lamps, and power everything.  The body seems like a Jaguar rip off, so you feel like your driving a Jag for half the price.

The Sonata drives very smooth, like a car twice its price.  The ABS package comes with traction control, 4 wheel disc brakes... and a sunroof.  Sorry, if you want the ABS you have to pay for the sunroof.  You can get the Sonata in a 4 or 6 cylinder engine.  The price is right, so why not go for the 6.  If you do decide to buy a 4, you may get an even better deal, because everyone wants the 6 and there is a glut of 4's out there.

All models of the Sonata are roomy.  The trunk is huge, though not the right dimensions for some cargo.  The back seat is very comfortable with lots of head and leg room. The back seat completes its high comfort level with a retractable armrest.

Now, the finale...  The Sonata comes with a 100,000 mile powertrain warrenty, a 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warrenty, and 5 years roadside assistance (so you can get rid of your AAA membership).  Not only that, but you can buy up the bumper to bumper warrenty to 100,000 miles for an extra $1200.  That "buy-up" will pay for itself, because things just wear out over 100,000 miles.  If they don't wear out in 100,000 miles the Sonata must be worth that extra $1200
