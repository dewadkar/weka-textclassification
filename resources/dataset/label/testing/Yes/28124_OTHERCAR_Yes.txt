            I bought this camera because I wanted a inexpensive megapixel camera and that is what I got.  It is a little hard to get used to using, but it is a pretty nice camera.  I don't know if it is just mine or not, but sometimes when I go to turn on the viewfinder it just flat out refuses to come on.  This is really annoying when I am trying to get some stuff done.  I have to end up turning the camera on and off a bunch of times before it works right.  Besides doing that everything else about the camera is fine.  It's viewfinder (when it comes on) has one of the best refresh rates you will find.  I used my brothers $550 camera and the refresh rate of my camera was much better.<br><br>
