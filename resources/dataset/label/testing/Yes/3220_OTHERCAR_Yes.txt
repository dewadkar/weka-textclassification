            This is a second car, I only drive it on the weekends or special trips. I bought my first C-Class (C220) new in 1995, and intended to keep it for at least 10 years. But when I saw this car's better performance, options, and special edition designation, I had to trade for it. It had all the options (and more) I had originally wanted but could not afford on my 1995 C-Class, and for about the same price $32.5k - inclusive of 4 years scheduled maintenance. Options include two-tone black and grey leather interior with grey stitching, dual-zone climate control, and rear fold-down seats. Acceleration response is quicker than the C280 I test drove, yet not as immediate as the E320. But then again, having saved $4k over the C280 and $16k over the E320, I'm not complaining!

The C230 Kompressor engine delivers sound performance. Though some describe its low-RPM sound as "growling," that is more than made up for by the faint-yet-distinctive sound of the turbine as engine power builds past 3000 RPMs. I can't help but compare it to a jet airliner (i.e., Boeing 7x7) at the end of the runway cleared for takeoff - with similar solid engineering and design for safety! Deceleration is also tractable - and if stops are anticipated well in advance, only a minimum of braking is required. This is good, since as reported in another opinion, black brake dust does tend to collect on its front wheels. But with a car as beautiful as this one, you'll want to wash and wax it often!

Sure - this is neither a drag racer nor the fastest thing on the road. If speed is your issue, buy a Z-28, Cobra or similar muscle car and save yourself 10 grand. But if you appreciate a well thought-out, designed, and built automobile, this one's for you. There are some differences I had to get used to that were inherent in this (first generation) C-Class design - for example, the adjustable steering wheel telescopes but does not tilt, and the dual-zone climate control though automatic-temperature, has no automatic fan setting. But these issues do not detract from comfort or function, and therefore are no longer a factor to me.

The only con I can think of is the paint finish. My particular car (from which I chose out of about 7 similar ones available at the dealership, because it ran best at idle) had two paint issues - one rear pillar spot that had to be buffed out where some plastic from delivery had stuck to it, and another on the trunk where the clearcoat needs attention. The latter is only visible in flourescent light, and if it were not for the lights in my garage I would never have noticed it. I am currently overseas for work, and fully expect to get this resolved at the Mercedes-Benz dealer when I return to the US permanently next month.

If you are single or have a small family, this car is sporty, versatile, well-engineered, and tons of fun to drive - in a word, wheeee! I hope you get the chance to enjoy the experience as much as I do.
