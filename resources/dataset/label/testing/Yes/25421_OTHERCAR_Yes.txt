            This car will last forever! I bought it new and it has been one of the best decisions I've made.  Soft leather seats which can be heated is a must-have for the harsh winter months.  Dash is remarkably clear and easy to read, especially at night - very well lit.  Stereo cannot be beat.  The optional Nakamichi sound system provides crystal-clear surround-sound that is able to blast you out of the car, or provide you with soothing background music to compliment the smooth ride.  

If you are looking for an affordable, good, pre-owned car that will provide you with the comforts of home while driving and last for years, this is your car.

There are few drawbacks. The similarity in styling and body style to the Toyota Camry is one.  Limited head room in rear seats is another.  But if you want to avoid the land-yacht feeling of a bigger luxury car, such as the LS400, these are easily tolerated.
