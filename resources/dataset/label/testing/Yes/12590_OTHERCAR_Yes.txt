            This camera has been nothing but a joy for me to use, but might not be for everybody:

I bought this camera because I finally wanted a digital camera after seeing many of my friends get them and love them. Also, I was going away to Florence for four months and my parents wanted me to send them pictures to email. I chose this model because the floorman at J&amp;R told me it was the highest recommended camera for use with Macs and was best equipped for USB functionality (including highest data transfer rate among common cameras at the time).

I found it to be incredibly easy to use, producing clear, sharp, and accurate photographs. It comes with a host of features, allowing a variety of picture-taking adjustments, comparable to an old manual camera. You can adjust the white balance, resolution, shutter speed, color tone, etc. It even comes with a feature to line-up panoramic shots which can be patched together with included software to create huge digital panoramas. Zoom goes as high as 4X with a digital macro zoom - occasionally I found this to be a little insufficient for zoom needs, especially because a feature like macro zoom is only intended for close ups, as distance shots will appear blurred.

These features are generally more than I need. I found more often than not, that I only needed to 'point-and-click' to get near-perfect shots, without touching a thing - automatic brightness and focus generally take care of everything. Not to mention, any pictures which might require touch-up can be appropriately edited using included Adobe software.

Transfer speed is great. I use a 300/3.2/64 and I can download 110 pictures in about 5 minutes using USB. The Canon-provided application has a simple and attractive interface for picture browsing.

I really only had three problems. First, the fast shutter/night shot feature - I tried to take pictures at night using the slow shutter, but they always came out blurred because I could not keep my hand still enough - I imagine this would be a problem with most digital cameras, and is a poor substitute for high-exposure film. Second, there is a relatively long delay between the moment the button is pressed and the moment the picture is taken, generally about 2-3 seconds (again, probably a problem with most digital cameras). The result is that often split-second instances are lost and also some spontaneity, when a subject has two-seconds to realize they're being photographed - not a big problems, just a small gripe (I wouldn't recommend this camera for action shooters). And third, again probably common with all other digital cameras, the battery life is very short. You may think you're saving money on a digital camera because you will never have to buy film again. This is true - however, if you do not buy a rechargeable battery, you will find yourself buying a new $10-15 battery every hundred pictures or so - very inefficient. If you buy this camera, buy the rechargeable battery! <br><br>
