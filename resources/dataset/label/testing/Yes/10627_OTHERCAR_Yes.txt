            	Two days ago, when I pulled up along aside the curb in front of my house after work, I looked into my driveway.  There sat a gorgeous black Daewoo Leganza. My mom had traded in her Mitsubishi Galant and bought a new car last Friday and kept it a secret. 

	I just bought a brand new Mitsubishi Mirage last year and won't trade it for anything for a long time, but when my mother let me take the new Daewoo for a spin, I must say that I was impressed!

	If you're looking for affordable luxury at a nice price, then I recommend the Daewoo. Get it before Ford buys the company and jacks up the price. For under $15000, my mom has a beautiful black Daewoo Leganza with leather interior, power windows, door locks, trunk, antenna, sunroof and a fantastic factory audio system with am/fm radio, cassette AND CD!!! The Daewoo Leganza offers a smooth ride, a cool look and an amazing interior atmosphere! <br><br>
