            This was my first try at a digital camera (I have used expensive film cameras for years, but felt it was time to go digital.) I love the way it fits into my shirt pocket, so I take every time I go to an event that has a photo op. The LCD screen is very clear - everyone I take a pic of just wants to see it it. I edit those bad shots out when I have a chance so I end up storing only good shots. Went on 2 week vacation and the 128 Mb card I bought was enough for the whole trip. I am able to get over 160 pix at the highest resolution on this card. With the second battery I got from canon as part of their package, I never have to worry about running out of power.
The resolution is terrific, and on my inkjet printer, I get lab quality prints. I also tried Ofoto and they are great too. I was able to post a 70 picture album for my family and friends to see over the internet, and got prints of the ones I liked most and the prints were first quality (better than I use to get from CVS for my film camera). I found a source of quality epson print paper for my epson printer, at an amazing price of $20 for 100 sheets at Costco, and that with the costs of the inkjet cartridges make my prints about half the cost of Ofoto.
Haven't used the movie feature much yet, or the photo stitching yet, and probably wont.
Only shortcoming was the software that came with the camera. Cant load movies,up, bombs my computer. Some other features are also unusable for me.
