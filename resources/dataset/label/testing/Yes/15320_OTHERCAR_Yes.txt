            I received my Sony Mavica FD-83 for Christmas a couple of years ago, much to my delight, and I was able to use it right away.

The MVC-FD83 has a number of desirable and easy-to-use features. It allows you to switch the focus from manual to automatic. The LCD screen on the back has a backlight that can be turned on or off and can be brightened or darkened. The zoom goes up to 6x, which I've found is plenty for most of what I do as a hobby photographer (if I were a nature photographer or a professional, I'd probably want to upgrade to the FD-91 which has a higher zoom capability). The zoom button is conveniently located right where your thumb normally rests when your index finger is on the photo button. The power on/off button is an ingeniously-designed little creature that you have to do in two stages (both of which can be done with the thumb at the same time) to prevent the camera from being activated simply from being bumped or played-with by a child. The disk eject is a similar mechanism. The menu can be accessed from a wheel pad and is extremely easy to see and maneuver. The digital display can be erased from the viewscreen in order to better see the results of your photo. The flash can easily be turned on or off and has a lighted button so that you know when it's on. A sliding switch lets you easily shift between "Play", "Still" and "Movie" modes. The camera can be programmed to automatically focus in on different aspects of each photo. Finally, pictures can be solarized, sepia-toned, black-and-white or even negative.

Within the menu are numerous options for changing the size and quality of the photos. The smallest and lowest-quality photos are about 8" x 6" (all of them are only 72 dpi), and you can fit about 25-30 of them on a single floppy disk, while the highest quality are 16" x 12" and about 8 of them can fit on a single floppy. Since they are all at 72 dpi, you will probably need to manipulate the photos within your computer software (Adobe PhotoDeluxe came with my camera and is super-simple to use, but Photoshop and ArcSoft and others can be used as well). With a little education, this is easy to do; for example, you can take a 16" x 12" photo at 72 dpi and change it within the software to, say, 5" x 3.5" at 300 dpi, and then print it out on photo paper and it's just awesome... almost indistinguishable from your film photos.

Also within the menu are ways to change your camera's flash, exposure, zoom, clock, etc. You can even format a disk within the camera, and it's fast.

The MPEG movies are not of the highest quality, however, I have found that they are perfect for capturing up to 60 seconds of my children's antics and then sending them to my mother via e-mail... she lives hundreds of miles away from us and doesn't get to see her grandchildren. She has always been thrilled to see us on her computer!

The battery that the camera comes with is a Sony NP-F330, which only lasts for about 1.5 hours, but there is a 4-hour battery (the Sony NP-F550) that will also fit in the camera and can be purchased separately. I recommend you do so, anyway, and keep a charged battery with you so you're not caught without juice. Finally, I also recommend you purchase the Mavica case to protect your investment (I got mine on eBay for about $10).

Loaded with features and incredibly easy on the hands (the square shape takes a little getting used to, but I found it to be ergonomically superior to APS and other automatic film cameras), the MVC-FD83 is worth your money and will make you the envy of your pals. I probably won't go back to my Minolta slr unless I just *had* to for some reason; my Mavica is just too easy and who needs the hassle of film developing (not to mention the crap-shoot of "will my pictures turn out?").
