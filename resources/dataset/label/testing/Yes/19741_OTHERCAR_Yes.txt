            After driving compacts cars for years, I was wary of buying such a large vehicle, but my growing family just didn't fit in those small cars anymore. When we began looking at minivans we were overwhelmed at the choices. After looking at ALL of them we finally decided on the Silhouette Premiere edition. We have never been sorry.

The Premiere edition is loaded with all the bells and whistles you can put on an auto. The interior is very roomy, with captain seats in front and middle. The seats are leather and oh so comfortable. The drivers seat includes a lower back support for extra comfort during long drives. The back and middle seats are easily removed if you need to transport large items. There are plenty of cup holders to hold all those drinks.

I think the best feature is the built in TV and VCR. My kids just love it and we successfully made a 1200 mile trip to Orlando while maintaining our sanity! The kids were really entertained and did not fight at all. The TV is really a hit with peers and your child's friends will always want to ride in your car on field trips, making your child the hit of the class. Don't worry about the noise, earphones take care of it and you can listen to your own musical selection while they watch TV. 

The van is as easy to drive as my compact autos, and I actually enjoy being up above those small little cars (can I ever go back?) The whole family loves this vehicle, and it makes driving the kids around a dream.
