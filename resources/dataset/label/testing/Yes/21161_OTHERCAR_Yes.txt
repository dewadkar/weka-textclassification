            I literally never leave home without my Cybershot. First off, know that the pictures are not the highest quality. They are, however, very good considering the low number of megapixels. I wanted to buy the camera because of its size. I could've bought a way better camera and taken better pictures, but I wouldn't have taken half pictures I've taken with the Cybershot because no other camera would've slipped into my purse. There have been quite a few times where I've literally pulled over, whipped out the Cybershot & taken a pic. I never would've been able to take with any other camera. I mean, how many times do you say to yourself, "I wish I had my camera?" With the Cybershot, you can always have it on you and it's not a hassle. 
  In well-lit situations, the pictures come out beautifully. It's in the dark situations that it gets tricky. When I use a flash, even with the red-eye reduction, I still have overly bright pics. of people with red-eye. The pictures come out too dark with the flash off. So what I usually do is take them without flash and then brighten them up using Microsoft PictureIt! on the computer. It doesn't make the pictures perfect, but decent. It's a sacrifice I find worth it to have the handiest camera around.
   I find the battery life to be perfect. They do take a while to recharge, but I just do it overnight and they're ready in the morning. It uses AAA batteries, so you can always just buy them, too.
