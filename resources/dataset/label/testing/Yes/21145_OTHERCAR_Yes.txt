            I needed a digital camera in order to put pictures of jewelry on my web site. I wasn't sure on what to buy. Most cameras didn't take a clear picture close up. I needed professional quality without spending a lot of money. After months of research, I decided on the Sony DSC-F505V. This is one of the best digital cameras that I have seen. It does more than I ever wanted from a digital camera. The pictures of my jewelry are so clear and detailed. This camera can also record a few seconds of motion picture with sound. I've had this camera for a few months now and I can't stop taking pictures. I would recommend this camera to anyone. Truly unbelievable. <br><br>
