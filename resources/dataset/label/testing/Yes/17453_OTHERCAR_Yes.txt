            I bought my Honda Prelude used in the fall of 2000 and have never regretted it.  For the money, you would be hard pressed to find a better handling car.  If a great handling car on a budget is what you seek, look no further.  I have taken this car to local auto-cross events and was amazed at how well this car performed.  Does keeping up with a Porsche (Boxster or older 911) through tight turns sound fun???  You bet!  One thing to watch on the Type SH when auto-crossing is that the ATTS (automatic torque-transfer system) is a little slow to react when in a tight slalom course and you end up fighting it a bit.  If you are not planning on auto-crossing this car, then the ATTS is simply amazing.  Imagine taking a turn at what seems to be too fast of a pace.  Feed it some gas and the ATTS will actually help pull the car though the turn simulating the oversteer of a rear wheel drive car.
Sure, 200HP may not seem enough for some people, but trust me, this car screams.  VTEC on this car is simply amazing.  If you are familiar with VTEC from a Civic or an Accord, forget what you know, this is how VTEC was intended to perform.  Step on the gas, hit 5300rpm and HOLD ON!!!
If you need a back seat, don't expect to find one here.  Room for one in the back is tight and this seat is better suited for grocery bags than passengers.
Insurance costs may also be a concern to younger drivers.  I am an under 25 single male, and insurance was almost enough to prevent me from buying this car (I have never regretted owning it though).
Safety is great.  I was involved in an accident where I was struck on the drivers side door at a considerable speed and was able to walk away with minimal injuries.  
Reliability...its a HONDA!!! To date, the only issue I have had outside of routine maintenance was a frozen rear caliper which could have been avoided with better preventive maintenance (read: changed brake fluid at regular intervals...whoops!)
