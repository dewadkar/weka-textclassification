            Upon realizing that the only reason I got film developed was in order to scan the prints into the computer, I realized it was time to get a Digital Camera. Most important to me in my decision was the quality of the images that could be captured by the camera and a solid optical zoom mechanism. 

The Nikon CoolPix 990 (when I got the camera) had the highest image quality available in a personal digital camera (3.34 megapixels). This meant that it captured the most image information allowing for the highest quality images. Having used the camera for about 250 pictures I have to agree that the image quality is excellent.

Additionally it had 3x Optical Zoom. This is very important because it allows you to size the picture without reducing the quality of the image. In addition to the 3x Optical Zoom, it has 4x digital zoom. The digital zoom, while interesting, does not give very good pictures. In my experience, the loss of quality with a digital zoom is such that I would never use it. I would rather zoom later using photoshop or some such program.

In general I have really liked this camera. However I think that it is a bit large - I haven't used other cameras to know if all of the digital cameras are large, but it is big and heavy compared to a standard film camera. I thought that I would not like the rotating lens part, but it is nice because the camera can take pictures in one direction while you are watching the picture from another angle. 

This camera has a lot of features some of which I have used and some I am still learning about. All in all this is a great camera and I am very happy with it!<br><br>
