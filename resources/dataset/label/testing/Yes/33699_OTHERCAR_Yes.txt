                My dad bought the Lexus LS400 because he needed a full size sedan that could transport him from Maryland to New Jersey and back, comfortably 2 times a week. In the business he works in he needs to keep a luxury status and the Lexus plays that role very nicely.
    The interior of the LS400 is very roomy it has ample leg, hip, head and whatever else you can think of in the front and back. The rear seats two adults very comfortably and 3 with little problem. The leather seats are very smooth and have a great texture, but be wary sharp objects can easily rip the leather. The front seats have power controls and you can even control your lumber support. The dials and buttons on the radio and climate control system are very precise and easy to read, day or night. The only complaint I have is that parts of the display have burnt out. Now every time I put in a CD or cassette the display says pay instead of play. The sound system is very good, it has never failed to play clear and smooth tunes. In all the interior is nicely put together and up to par.
   The exterior styling is conservative and is kind of bulky. In the engine department the 4 liter V-8 can really get the LS400 to move. It smoothly delivers 260 horsepower which gets the car from 0-60 in 7.1 seconds. The steering is precise and responsive. On the highway it it rides nearly on air. I definitely recommend it for long trips.     
   In all the Lexus is a powerful luxury cruiser for those who want a comfortable car with the extra hint of muscle.
