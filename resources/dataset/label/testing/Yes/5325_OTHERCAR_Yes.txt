            Although this car may look like a family sedan, it packs a surprising amount of power in its engine.  It accelerates reasonably quickly and purrs like a kitten if kept in good condition.  The car also handles very nicely, taking corners with precision and grace.  The most appealing part of the car for me though is not how it handles, but in the amazing amount of passenger room.  I have some very tall friends and it is important for me to have a car that is able to handle a full car of them plus any other luggage or baggage that might accompany them.  The trunk space is amazing and I have never had any trouble fitting in multiple suitcases and the like.  This car makes for great transportation for any family and I highly reccomend it!
Happy trails friends and good luck with your miles of trials and trials of miles!<br><br>
