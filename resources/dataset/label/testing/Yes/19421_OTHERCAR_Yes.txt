            After driving a suburban for four years I decided it was time to size down, and be more practical.  After test driving, too numerous to be mentioned vehicles, it dawned on me that I used to have a Honda, and it was wonderfully dependable.  And then I saw my first CRV, and it was love at first sight!  The first time I got in the CRV, I couldn't believe how much room was in it, and my husband who has spent the entirety of his driving life with his head up to the ceiling of each vehicle, could sit comfortably in it.  Then of course there are the amenities, four drink holders, change drawer, a large drawer under the passenger seat, large pockets on the back of the seats, another compartment under the ashtray, an ice chest, a picnic table, armrests even on the back seats, an outlet in back, another storage compartment on the back door, and two under the cargo mat, seats that fold completely down as a bed, and back seats that individually lift up and forward to give more storage space, and a special area to put head rests for the back seats when you do so.  I love my CRV, and of course it gets great gas mileage!!! My husband prefers a more powerful engine, but every weekend he always wants to drive my car, and now he is trying to say that he will kindly take it, if I want a new car, No Way!<br><br>
