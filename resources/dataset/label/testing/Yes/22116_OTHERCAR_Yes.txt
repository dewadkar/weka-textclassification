            I shopped around for quite some time before deciding on this digital camera.  This is easily the best camera available in its price range.  The camera is extremely easy to use.  All features are programmable through a graphical interface in the LCD window that can be likened to on screen programming of a VCR.  The pictures are of very high quality also.  There are three modes, and I have been using the lowest quality and the pictures still look great.  This setting is good for putting photos on the internet, which is my primary application, but the high quality mode produces some great looking photos.  

I would recommend getting a larger flash memory chip that is USB capable if you plan to take a lot of pictures.  This increases the number of pictures you can take, and the amount of time it takes to transfer them to a computer.  I found a 16MB card that came with a USB reader for $59.  I have even seen an extra card and reader packaged with the camera at some stores.  I only used the camera with batteries once and it lasted for about 150 pictures.  I typically use this camera with the AC adapter since I take most pictures indoors and it saves battery life.<br><br>
