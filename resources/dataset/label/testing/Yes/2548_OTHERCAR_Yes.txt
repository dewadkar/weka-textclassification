            We just love this new van. It is a 99  model, and is completely loaded with all of the extra little necessities that families with young kids need.  I love the remote control locks. With three little kids scrambling around, it makes it so easy to load and unload them, without having to make them stand there while I fumble for the keys.  Controls for the radio are also on the steering wheel, making it much easier and safer to adjust the volume, etc.  The tinted windows and reclining seats also make this van very nice for children on long trips, and there are plenty of cup holders and little storage areas that help keep things organized.  The more we drive this van, the more we are glad that we bought it.  The only thing we are a little disappointed about is the price tag, but the van is well worth the extra cost, in comparison to the Transport that we just traded in for it.  It drives nicely, and the seats fit like a glove, and there is plenty of leg room in the front and back seats. We are looking forward to taking some long road trips in it this summer!  <br><br>
