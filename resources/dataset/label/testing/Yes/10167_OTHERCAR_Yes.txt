            Recently I took the Lexus RX 300 for a test drive, and I must say, its a nice car.  It has great turning capabilities, and stop on the dime brakes.  The engine heats up pretty quickly, unlike the car I have now, a mini van, which takes 10 minutes until the heater works.  The only thing I don't like about this SUV is the gas pedal.  It is to hard to push down.  Or course, its not impossible, its only a pedal, but it is much more difficult than other cars I have driven.  Before this car gets moving, you basically have to push the pedal 3/4 of the way down.  This is the only feature I don't like about this car.  Otherwise, Lexus makes a nice SUV, just like its regular cars.  It is sleek, and a nice looking car.  The one I drove also had a video screen on it, with the outside temperature, and the current time, which I thought was kind of neat.  If you want a nice car, and can afford the price, give this lexus a try.<br><br>
