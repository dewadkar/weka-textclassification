            I do love my Jeep,don't get me wrong.It has plenty of room,great for long trips when a lot of packing is involved.but,it has some bad points too.Gas mileage for one,around 14mpg around town.and,it's a top heavy vehicle,on a windy day your vehicle feels like it's going to blow out of the road.Owning this vehicle though has made me not want a &quot;car&quot; ever again..When gas prices go down,I won't have much to fuss about..It came with a great stereo system,comfy seats,and a lot of power.If this sounds like your kind of vehicle,go take a test drive and see,I don't think you will be too disappointed.<br><br>
