             I have had the 1997 Subaru Legacy Outback for almost three years now.  I bought it used, it has 54,000 miles now, and has been nothing but a joy to drive and own for a plethora of reasons.  

   Not only does it have all-wheel drive and a height clearance equal to the ford explorer,  it handles smoothly and safely when in snow, rain, sand, mud, and wherever one desires to go.  

   As well, it's not so large and tall to be inclined to flip as most SUV's do, and is not difficult at all to parallel park.  The cargo room in the back with the seats up or down and has ample space for travel, moves, storage, skiing, beach days, or whatever your athletic and leisure time requires.  

   Most importantly, it is one of the safest cars in it's class, and I have been in two potentially serious accidents, but because of my beautiful sea green outback, myself and the car, are alive and well.  

   Filling up is quick and cheap when compared to other SUV's and larger wagons in it's class, such as the Volvo and ford models.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to any family member, friend, or person; male female, single married, kids no kids, for it will do nothing but survive and thrive.  Five stars, and no cons...  Please contact me if you wish further information or opinions. Thank you for your time. <br><br>
