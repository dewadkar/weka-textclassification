            I would love to have this car.  There are only a few things stopping me and these are things beyond my control:   The price of gas (which will never go down again) and the cost of insurance (three or four times any other typical vehicle). 

Simply put:  Here was an insurance comparison:  A 1997 Mercury Cougar with a Mustang GT engine (4.6 litre V8) in it cost $800 per year. The BASE MODEL Firebird (not much  faster than the Cougar), was $3700.  Hmmmm, can you say "RAPE"?

I wonder what the insurance on the Trans Am or Firehawk would be.  $5000?

For readers that don't know what a Firehawk is (and there are many), it's made in Canada (Quebec I think) and represents the HIGHEST END model for Firebirds. Forget anything you've heard about Trans Am's or Ram Air baloney.  Simply put, here is what the Firehawk gives you that a Trans Am does not:

- Larger tires (nicer looking rims too)
- Better suspension
- Wider exhaust
- 100% functioning and redesigned scoop (the ones on the Trans Am don't really work    as advertised including the so-called Ram Air models)
- A spoiler that actually creates downforce and eliminates the huge blindspot on the car. 
- Heat extractors
- Hurst shifter
- Limited quantity and individually numbered.

A 1999 Firehawk  was listed with a 0-60mph time of 5.0 seconds and a top speed of 163 mph.  That was just 0.1 seconds slower than a 1999 Corvette and only a dozen mph slower top speed.  It has the 345 or 350 lb-ft of tourque that a Corvette has for nearly HALF the price. It also has 330hp, more than a Trans Am.

The reason I like the Firehawk upgrade so much is because it emphasizes function over form. The Trans Am versions look nice, but the softer lines on the hood of a Firehawk help the scoop actually do its job. And that's what counts.  Ditto for the spoiler. The Firehawk spoiler looks somewhat plain compared to the HUGE spoiler on a Trans Am....but it works unlike the Trans Am spoiler. If you're lucky enough to even see a Firehawk (and many people will never see one) you'll notice the difference from the holes on the front hood (the heat extractors) plus the more rounded hood.  The car just looks better in my opinion.

These cars really look stunning and muscular on the road. And on the track you can kiss goodbye to Mustangs and even more exotic imports. (ie: That guy in the $50,000 Porsche Boxster will look puzzled as you leave him in your dust.)

This car takes a backseat to nobody on the road performance wise.  It would give a Dodge Viper a run for its money.

GM also does a terrible job marketing this car.  Simply put, they never advertise it or promote it so nobody knows about it. People have short memories, and unless GM creates an image for this car for new generations, nobody will even know it exists.

Also, the insurance companies will rape you by charging you unfair rates.  And if you're a young male, they probably won't insure you at all. Be prepared to pay a LOT to keep driving this car.

It's too bad we can't have fun anymore.
