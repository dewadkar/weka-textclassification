            This was our first foray into digital camera's and I can't say how much we love this camera.

It is extremely easy to use.  You have three options for quality of picture.  The higher quality the fewer amount of pictures the camera will hold.  You can purchase additional reusable memory cards so that you don't have to download your pictures to be able to take more.

It also has the l.e.d. display.  I don't know why you would buy a digital camera without a display.  It also comes with a flash.

The one bad point of the 780c is that it does not have zoom.  Most digital cameras do not come with zoom.  The reason being is that you can enhance the pictures once they are downloaded on the computer.  A zoom would be nice built into the camera but I would not let this fact stop you from buying this camera.

It seems durable.  We have taken it to the beach, stuffed it in suitcases, and found our two year old bouncing it on the floor. 

I purchased this camera on-line for under 200$.  Look for a deal on this camera and you will probably find one.  I would recommend this camera to anyone as a good starter camera.<br><br>
