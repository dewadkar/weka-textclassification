            The first thing that should be said is that the "Rodeo Sport" was, until this year, the "Amigo".  Apparently the name "Amigo" was not selling enough vehicles, so Isuzu decided to latch onto the "Rodeo" name.  The Rodeo sells very well here in the USA.

INTRO:
Late 2000.  I was ready for another vehicle.  I knew I wanted a SUV of some type, but wasn't sure which one.  After doing some fairly exhaustive research on the web, I came up with one conclusion:  Amigo/Rodeo Sport.  Dollar for dollar, and feature for feature, it's simply the best deal in SUV's out there.

VEHICLE LOOKS:
I was very concerned with the look of the vehicle.  I am a 35yo unmarried male, and the last thing I wanted was a "cute" SUV like the Vitara or Sportage.  I mean, I don't want to offend anybody, but those vehicles look a little too feminine for my tastes.  I wanted a rugged looking masculine vehicle.  Period.  I never want to hear the words "Oh, it's so cute" about any of my vehicles.

The Rodeo Sport IS a masculine looking vehicle.  It's wide track, 16 inch tires, and lowered front end make it look kinda like a pit-bull getting ready to attack.

BODY STYLE:
I opted for the non-removable hardtop.  I live in Indiana, and wouldn't really get a chance to use the removable soft top very often.  The hard top is also much more quiet and secure, also.  The Rodeo Sport only comes in a 2-door model.  Mine is jet black.

ENGINE:
I opted for the 6cyl 3.2L 195hp engine, and I must say that it propels this vehicle very well.  Fast accelleration, and plenty of passing power.  I haven't had a chance to drive the 4cyl model, but from my experience, the 6cyl engine is the one to have.

TRANSMISSION:
I opted for the 4 speed automatic and 4WD.  The transmission shifts smoothly and fluidly, and the shift timing is very good.  One nice feature is the "Power" and "Winter" transmission modes, which are turned on/off by a couple of push-switches on the console.  The "Power" setting makes the transmission shift at higher RPM's, while the "Winter" mode keeps the trans from shifting on snow and ice.  Both settings are useful.

OPTIONS:
You definitely want to get the "Preferred Equipment" package, which includes Air, Power windows and locks, AM/FM/CD radio (has a 6 disc changer built in), floor mats, and some other stuff.  Another option I would recommend is the limited slip differential, which transfers power to the wheels with the most traction.  Good for winter driving.

THE RIDE:
The ride is pretty smooth for a vehicle based on a truck frame.  It's not like riding in a car, but it's not quite like riding in a pickup either.  Kind of in-between.  Isuzu offers a electronically controlled suspension system that supposedly allows you to adjust the ride, but I wasn't able to get that option when I bought the vehicle.

OFF ROADING:
The Rodeo Sport was made for off roading, and it shows.  It's wheelbase and ground clearance are better than a Jeep Wrangler, and the V6 engine will power it thru just about anything.  I've climbed hills, forded streams, drove thru deep sand, heavy snow, you name it, and the Rodeo Sport has never even needed to catch it's breath.  This vehicle will outclimb and out-trail just about any other SUV out there, especially the Exploders (I mean Explorers), Jimmy's, and Blazers.

ONE OF A KIND:
One BIG perk to owning a Rodeo Sport is that hardly anybody else has got one.  How many cookie cutter Blazers and Explorers do you see on the road every day?  Now, how many Amigo's and Rodeo Sports have you ever seen?  If you want to stand out from the crowd, this vehicle os for you.  If you are a mindless, conformist sheep, and want to be the same as everyone else, go buy one of the other SUV's.

PRICE:
This is a competitively priced vehicle.  Expect to get one for under $25000 with every available option.  Take off any rebates or incentives from that.  You can get a base model for about $17000.

THE DOWN SIDE:
Well, first of all, this vehicle has a back seat, but you'd better be plastic man if you want to get in it.  There's just not much room to get in.  Once in the backseat, though, it's nice and roomy.  My next beef is the Radio/CD Changer.  It sounds bad.  Very tinny with large chunks of the musical spectrum missing or subdued.  New speakers may fix this, but I'd recommend replacing the entire sound system.  I also had a small water leak on the hardtop when I first got the vehicle, but it fixed itself.  

AVAILABILITY:
This is also a sore point.  Remember I said that hardly anyone has a Rodeo Sport?  Well, it may be because they are so hard to find, and once you find a dealer, you may have to wait a while before your vehicle comes in.  In my opinion, this vehicle is well worth the effort, though.

That's my two cents!
