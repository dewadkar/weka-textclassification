            I am now into my 3rd month of owning (leasing) my 2003 Jetta GLS. Before buying, I test drove the Passat which did not have the punch or interior style that I like so much in the Jetta. While it is a common car (most popular "European" model sold in the US), it posseses many uncommon qualities. The powerplant is superb - mine is a 1.8 Turbo. You can fly in this machine, and get around 30 mpg! Acceleration is ample and the standard transmission is very smooth. I like this car because it is one of the last true European sport sedans on the (US) market. A previous Saab enthusiast, I have watched the esteemed Swedish marque slowly morph into a GM product. The same is true with Volvo and Ford. Even Audi seems to be stretching out its A4 to bloated American style dimensions. The Jetta, however, stays true to its form. 
The car has lived up to, and in several instances, exceeded my expectations. Standard features are too numerous for me to now list, and well thought out. My only options were sunroof and cold weather package. All the controls seem to work fine. There is no other European that delivers so much for so affordable a price. Outstanding warranty, too.
This is not a good primary family car (too small)- although it makes a fine secondary family vehicle. My biggest peeve is the limited amount of space in which to extend my left leg while driving on the highway. It is not a critical issue - the leg gets extended when depressing the clutch. It's just that the left side of the floorspace in front of the driver is restricted. I am getting used to this driving position, so it is not a deal breaker.
Another slight peeve is that the suspension is rather soft in the stock GLS. With an engine and transmission so willing, I would have liked to see a stiffer suspension that does not lean so much in those curvy entrance / exit ramps. I did not test drive the sport package - but I certainly will the next time around.
All in all.....GREAT JOB VW! Thanks for keeping sensible, ecologically responsible, fun driving alive in this age of SUV monstrosities.
