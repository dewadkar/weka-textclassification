            Let me start off by fist telling you that I am a current owner of a silver Honda Civic like the one shown above and let me also tell you that when I first drove it, I fell in love for the first time in my life.  This car has it all from great looks to unbelievable control.  It is small enough to squeeze into the smallest of places and the steering is unreal.  The interior is very comfortable and the driving of this car is so very smooth.  I strongly recommend this beautiful 4 door sedan to anyone of all ages, genders, races, religions, let me tell you that this car has it ALL!<br><br>
