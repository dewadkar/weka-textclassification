            Overall: If you are looking for a V6 sedan with a manual transmission, your choices are limited.  The Altima is a great choice in this price range, with exterior styling and interior room that blows away the Camry and Accord.  We bought the V6 with the 5 speed manual with sunroof for 21,100 and enjoy cranking it around town, on backroads and freeways alike.  Its main competitor, the Passat, has a much weaker V6 (by the numbers) and is smaller on the inside, whereas the Altima would comfortably fit a high school basketball team. Other competitors would be the Chrysler sedans which are better looking and have much bigger trunks but questionable on the reliability and fail to offer a stick. My wife and I have put 12000 mi on the car in 5 months with no problems.  

Engine Performance: Neither of us like to floor it, and we are puzzled by the fact that so many lesser cars toast us at stoplights.  Maybe we are just wimps.  Even the turbo 4 cyl Passat feels a bit spritelier. I have read that the 240 hp number may be overstated and I would not be surprised, but we can feel the massive torque on the hills of SF (remember Bullitt?) and it never feels underpowered. The car wants to cruise in the 1800-3000 rpm range which takes you to about 76 mph (more on this later).  Can hit advertised fuel mileage if you drive like an old lady, which defeats the point of this purchase. 

Brakes: great

Handling: A bit of torque steer, traction control is available only on some automatic trans cars. The steering is a bit vague and indifferent, so you have to pay attention or you can drift a bit, unlike the Passat which I have also driven.  You cannot dive into turns with the same confidence as with some other cars such as BMWs or VWs.  Nor did I feel comfortable testing its high end, I chickened out at 115 with plenty of grunt to spare but a bit of road nervousness I would not expect from a Euro. But, hey, its a bigger car with a lower price tag, somewhat of a compromise between the Euros and the Chryslers in feel. 

Shifter: a bit notchy but overall quite OK. I wish the first three gears were a bit closer and the last two further out like a true overdrive, but that's just me. 

Interior and comfort: Yes a bit plastic but the seats are excellent (drove across country no problems) and the rear seat spacious, leggy and comfortable. All controls/dials reasonably ergonomic. 

Misc:  this is odd, but I am pretty sure the speedometer reads 10% too fast (checked against roadside indicator).  It makes a difference when you think you doing 90 and actually only going 81. Maybe they want to save me some money. Also, they should offer the same great colours they provide for the Maxima.  No bold dark blues reds and greens are offered.
