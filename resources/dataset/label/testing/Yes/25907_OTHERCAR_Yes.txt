            I did alot of research while looking for a digital camera and finally decided upon the Olympus C-4040 Zoom, and am I glad I did.

What's Included?

Here's the one area where this is lacking, although just about every camera out there is the same or worse.  Considering the amount of money being spent, there is no case included, and the smart media card included is 16mb, good for about 17 photos on HQ jpeg mode.  I immediately went out and purchased a 64mb card ($37 at Costco) USB connection cable, software, camera strap, and lense cap are all included

Installation

Set up was extremely easy.  The provided cd-rom allows easy installation of Olympus' Camedia Master 2.5 software.  This allows you to sort and view photos on your computer and is a pretty good program.  The driver for windows 98 is also included on the cd and installs easily.  The camera connects via USB and was recognized immediately.

About the Camera

The camera is sharp looking, small and lightweight.  The controls are identical in setup to the Olympus C-3040.  It has a 1.8" LCD Screen on back, On the left side are the I/O ports, a DC input for AC adapter or battery pack, A/V output, and a high-speed USB port.  On the right side, is the camera's hand grip.  On the back side of the handgrip is the covered card slot, and it is very easy to remove cards. The camera uses 3.3v smartmedia cards.  Olympus includes a 16MB card, but any size up to 128MB may be used. 

Modes:

There is a point and shoot auto program, which will work in a variety of settings, as well as shutter speed priority, aperture priority or full manual mode with speeds up to 16 seconds.  You can also switch to Black and White or Sephia modes in camera.  In addition to the still modes there is a QuickTime movie mode at 15 frames per second with sound. Movie recording time is limited to 32 seconds in HQ and up to 148 seconds in SQ quality. The movies are very clear, but you cannot use the optical zoom.  There is also a continuous burst mode that shoots upto 2 frames per second.

Menus:

Menus appear on the LCD and are very easy to navigate through.  I am still learning all the menus, but to date have had no problems finding what I have needed.

The lense:

This camera has an incredibly fast F1.8 - F2.6 lens with a 35mm equivalent of 35-105mm focal length. It's an all-glass, aspherical lens and has a digital zoom function with 1 - 2.5x possible. Auto or Manual focus is possible.  One difference from the 3040, is a rubber grip around the lens barrel. 

The LCD:

The camera has a 1.8-inch color LCD and has high quality resolution.  The backlight can be adjusted to accomadate most viewing conditions. The display pans smoothly to follow the subject.  It also provides for photo and movie play/delete when in the play mode.

Batteries:

The camera takes 4AA batteries.  Two Olympus CR-V3 lithium batteries are included, but they are one-use batteries.  I would recommend going out and purchasing rechargeable batteries and a charger, and it would probably be wise to pick up and extra set.  Battery life is pretty good when just shooting pictures, however if you are constantly using the lcd screen, batteries can drain quickly.

Image Quality:

This is why we buy cameras isnt it???  The image quality will not disappoint.  With a 4.13 megapixel CCD, it will easily provide professional quality 8x10's(and I would think photo-quality 16x20's, but I havent done any as of yet).  Photo's are exposed properly and color is very true to the subject.  I have been printing mine on a HP 895 and am completely satisfied with the results.

I am throughly pleased with this camera.  I probably dont need everything this camera affords, however, it has everything I wanted and will allow me to grow into it as I become a better photographer.  The auto mode will allow the earliest beginner to take high quality photos, and grow with the camera.  However, if you dont want to spend the additional money for the 4.1 megapixels, I would recommend purchasing the Olympus C3040, which has almost all the same features and still offers great picture quality(3.34 megapixels) at a more affordable price.

***Update***

I have since had a 16x20 printed at ofoto.com from this camera and the quality is outstanding!!!  According to their site the resolution of the photos are good enough to get a photo quality poster size photo (20x30)

I am also now shooting professional boxing matches with this camera as well, for an idea on how this camera works for fast action, you can goto www.pbase.com/muls for some examples.
