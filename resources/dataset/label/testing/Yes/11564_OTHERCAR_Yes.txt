            Jeep Cherokees are the greatest SUVs ever!  I bought a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport and have been happy with it since the day I bought it.  The handling is superb.  It looks great, especially covered in mud. 

I added 33&quot; X 12&quot; BFGoodrich Radial All Terrains to it although the stock tires were great. I also put on new rims even though the original ones were great too.  I put manual locking hubs on and a 3&quot; Superlift.   I added a 5000 lb. winch but haven't needed it yet. I love the off-road capabilities of my Jeep.  
I have been in 3 feet of mud and water and had no problems. It is the greatest experience to drive this SUV.  It handles like a car.  I love the room in the back for all my hiking gear. 
 A few problems with it are the lack of rear space.  It isn't too bad but the doors are small.  The rear window should roll down or flip up.  It needs to be more open.  
I love the long wheel base, it definitely out performs a Wrangler.  I'd recomend one for anybody looking for a SUV that performs and handles well at a reasonable price.  Not to mention how sweet they look going down the road or shall I say off the road!<br><br>
