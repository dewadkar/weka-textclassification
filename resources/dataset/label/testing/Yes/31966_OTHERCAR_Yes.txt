            The 2000 Honda Passport has Mucho Power! This car is raw, fast, powerful, and it will thrash the competition, and at a great price. For under 30 g's, I'm pretty sure anybody's getting a deal on this bad boy. The Passport handles amazingly well in the snow with it's highly accelerated V6 Engine and gets me about 17 miles to the gallon, which are definitley two plusses. I love this car with all my heart. I bought it over the Chevy Blazer, becuase the blazer had too much of a truck ride. The explorer is a scrub, it's tall, but it couldn't out due the passport. The passport can tear the intermediate utility competetion with one hand tied behind it's back. The one problem with this car is it's sight and sharp handling. Other than that, the interior is roomy for an SUV, and mine's fully loaded. Buy a passport. Hell yeah!<br><br>
