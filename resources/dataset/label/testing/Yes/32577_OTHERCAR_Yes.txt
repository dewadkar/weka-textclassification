            I have a 97 SL2 Saturn.   I bought it for the price (no negotiating) although you still negotiate the price of any trade in.  I drove it right out of the show room &quot;window&quot; and loved it.  I wanted a black car and purchased the &quot;black gold&quot; color.  It was very sleek and shiny.  I will never buy a black car again.  It shows every bit of dust - the inside is also a blackish grey color and shows every bit of dust.  I always had white and light color cars and never remember it showing every spot as black does.  As far as the car - I cannot complain at all - it runs great - although had a short &quot;break in period&quot; before it actually seemed to run smoothly.  Saturn is very good with their 3 year warranty period. The only problem is my dealer does not have loaner cars - so you have to wait there or make arrangements for someone to pick up or take you there- a bit of an inconvenience. I take senior citizens in my car and they find it very difficult to lift their legs into the front passenger side - it is a bit short and high for them.  These are the few &quot;minor&quot; complaints I have - all in all - it's great.  <br><br>
