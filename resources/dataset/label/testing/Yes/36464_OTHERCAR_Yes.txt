            The Altima is finally all grown up.  Gone is the $13,000 fully loaded with leather from 1992.  The new 2002 Altima has cutting edge styling, but the base price of around $20000 for a 2.5 SE Model is unfortunately too much.

Style:
The New Altima has a lot of this.  It can be best described as a Chrysler 300M imitating a Lexus GS400 imitating a VW Passat.  The beautiful muscle lines are accentuated with a high back-end and clear tail lamps.  Dimensions-wise, the Altima is taller, wider and longer than its predecessor.  In fact, the Altima's dimensions are so big that it is now LARGER than the Maxima.

Interior:
The 1992 Altima has one big advantage over the new Altima....leather seats.  In that car, leather seats were standard.  The New Altima costs a lot more in comparison and isn't well-equipped.

Comfort is much better.  Being larger than the maxima, 5 adults have no problem sitting for relatively long distances.  The slightly dome roofline creates plenty of headroom and shoulder-room.

Power:
The 2.5 S comes standard with manual transmission.  I always recommend stick for suburban and highway dwellers.  Driving around the city is no fun with a stick.  The highest model comes with an optional 250 HP V6.  Definately worth considering.

Price:
Unfortunately, the only good deal at dealers right now is the low-end model.  The 2.5 S sells for roughly $19,000.  Add any options to that price and this car isn't worth it.

The mew Camry is comparable in price and is much improved over it's older version, the Galant has always been well-equipped for a cheap price.

However, the best alternative to this Altima would be the 2002 Maxima.  Nissan has improved styling somewhat, but added a 260 HP V6 and very nice options.  The Maxima also gives you a more upscale class.  Nissan's strategy is simple...create similar cars for 2 groups of people.  The Altima is the edgy styling car, created for Passat-buyers.  The Maxima gives you a sportier, middle-aged, family car.

VERDICT:
DOn't run out and buy this car yet.  It WILL go down in price.  And when it does, buy this car and brag about all its niftyness.
