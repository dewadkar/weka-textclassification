            This is my first car, and I absolutely love it.  It is quite a fast car for its price, which is something not many people expect.  It has a V6 3.4L engine, 170HP.  The automatic transmission is very very smooth, unfortunately its the only tranny you can get with the V6, if you want a manual, you have to go with the 2.4L Inline 4cylinder, which is 150HP.

The styling of this car isnt the plain jane you get with a civic.  Its aggressive, and attractive, stands out in a crowd.  I like my SE, however the GT is a better looking car.  I have a sedan, a coupe version is also available.  

It isnt exactly huge inside, but it is roomy enough, especially for the price and age group it seems to be aimed at.  The seats are comfortable, but to me, a little too stiff.  The interior is nice in that all the components are aimed around the driver.  The center dashboard part, with the stereo, and climate control is angled towards the driver, a feature I have never before seen.  The cupholders are badly located, the shifter gets in the way when I try and put it in park.  Also, the cupholders in the back are shallow and I feel as though cups would fall out around corners.

The ride of this car is great.  It handles like a more expensive car, and zooms around like something more sporty.  Traction control is an option and it is great.  If you are buying this car GET THE TRACTION CONTROL.  It has probably saved me from getting in an accident on multiple occasions.  One day, on the way to school on a snowy road, I started around a turn, and although the front of the car was going around the turn, and I was pointed in the direction of the road, my car was moving sideways towards a telephone pole, and rock wall.  All of the sudden I heard the tell tale noise of my traction control, saw the TRAC light flash, and I had regained control and was moving where I wanted to go.  This is a great feature in the snow.  It has helped in other emergency manuevers and snowy conditions that I dont have time to mention.  It also has helped in emergency stopping, so that I didnt skid, and also so that the ABS didnt go off.

Some negatives are that there are some problems with it such as many customers have complained of warped rotors, if you take it to the dealer they should be able to replace them if still under warranty.  Wierd stuff like my door handle being bent and sticking out from the car.  The front air dam is a bit to low and from the snow and a few bottoming-outs....it fell off.  

Well I will add to this as I think of more down the road.
Any questions feel free to email me @ sjg98@hotmail.com

In the end this is a nice car, a fast, comfortable, well handling machine that will let you be seen in a crowd, unlike the endless droves of civics, sentras, accords, and altimas that this car competes with.
