            I just bought the 2000 MPV LX. Got a great deal and the Mazda dealership was great to work with. I bought the base model LX and still got great standard options like A/C, Auto transmission, CD Player, tinted side windows, and much more. For a base price of about $ 22,000, you can't ask for much more.

The MPV is very roomy. In total size, it is smaller than a lot of other vans, but the interior design allows for plenty of space. The ride is very smooth and quiet. I had read that the pick-up was not great in the MPV, but I have not found that to be the case. The V-6 engine has plenty of power.

This is a great buy for a young family buying their first van of family vehicle. It won't break the bank and you get all the options you need. The MPV comes with a 3 year warranty and road side assistance.<br><br>
