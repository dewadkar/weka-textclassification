            The dodge ram is a great truck.  Plain and simple.  Let's start on the outside.  The 1550 Quad cab, which is what I purchased, is simply beautiful on the outside.  At first, I was kind of partial to the EXPENSIVE Silverado, but the more and more that I look at it the more and more I admire it.  From the outside, it just looks powerful.  The bed is nice and big.  The wheels are huge and the rims are steel.
The engine is a 5.2 liter, V8 engine.  No problems yet.  The inside feels like you are in a jetliner cockpit.  It is spacious, nice looking, and the view is high off the ground with that, "I own the road" feeling.  Surprisingly the ride is smooth and very controlled.  I expected it to ride rough and tight, but I feel as if I'm driving a Honda Accord.  The one well maybe two drawbacks:  It doesn't have the get up and go like it brother the Dakota and the fuel economy isn't that great.  I'd say maybe 15 in the city.  BUT, I priced the Silverado and for a basic one it is about 18,000.  Loaded, like the Ram, it is about 25,000 whereas the Ram, loaded, is about 18,995 (thats what I paid).  Test drive a Ram, you won't be disappointed!
