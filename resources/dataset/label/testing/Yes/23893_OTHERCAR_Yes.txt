            I was in the Market for a Japanese luxo-sedan when my Saab was totaled. I have a high regard for the Swedes pursuit of safety and performance but I have an even higher appreciation for Japanese quality and rock solid dependability.  
My search had it narrowed down to an Acura 2.5TL, BMW 3 Series, Infinity Q45, Lexus ES, and the Millenia.  I had a cap of 15K to find a used car with higher miles. American cars need not apply if you plan on something with 50-90 thousand miles  and taking it to over 200K. Check any publication for predicted reliability to back up that statement and you'll see it my way.  The Acura was a 5 cylinder with good looks and ho hum performance and the ES was smooth being a glorified Camry. All of those cars are worthy of my driveway, However I came to own a Millenia by chance. I was ready to buy any of those choices based on the best deal I can discover in the papers. I bought my Pearl Millenia S from a Dr. that under priced the car for a quick sale of 12,500. It had 65 thousand miles and was mint with after market 18&quot; 5-star rims. My brother with his Mercedes is starting to get envious when strangers ask me what kind of car it is. This could have been a great Amati that would have rivaled Lexus and Infinity. I believe the 18&quot; rims make this a great looking car and worth the extra money . Read all about the Miller cycle engine and search for deal today.<br><br>
