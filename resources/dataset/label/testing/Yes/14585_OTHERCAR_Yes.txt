            Driving the 1991 Honda Accord LX is like driving an automobile designed by yourself. Things are where they feel they should be. Levers and buttons react and feel like they should. The ergonomics in this model are superb, and the rest of the car feeds off of this quality.

Ideal for city driving, the Honda Accord makes for easy manuevering in tight confines, and is especially suited for the college student winding through a tight campus. Even equipped with the standard V4, it performs admirably on the highway as well, reaching 3000 RPM at about 72-74 MPH.

It's hard to find any complaints with this model. About the only thing to improve upon would be to make the horn a more prominent part of the steering wheel than the current configuration of two small buttons.

If you're looking for a well-engineered car that virtually never breaks down, the Honda Accord LX is for you.<br><br>
