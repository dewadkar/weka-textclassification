               I purchased this vehicle after taking it for a test drive.  the car handles great and I felt comfortable in the car on the test drive.  The car is great for getting noticed in, if that is your thing.  Chyrsler also added a great radio and sound system to the car.  This is the Lx model i am referring to.  I'll bet the Lxi has an even better sound system in it.  I can pick up a station on my radio clearly that wont even come in at all in my parents car or my brothers car.  The car is also good because it has plenty of room for whatever you need to have in the car.  Whether it be people or clothes or whatever, there is enough room in the Cirrus for moving it.  It has a rear-folding back seat that allows for an extended trunk to help in cargo space.  The only thing i dislike about the Lx is the fact that the engine os only a 4 cylinder.  If you have the money for the Lxi, i would recommend that one very much.  However if you do not, i would still highly recommend the Lx.  The car is great if you do not desire a lot of power in a car and that is good for younger kids who think racing and driving fast i cool.  they can get going fast still, but they cant race which is a definate plus for young drivers.  I would just like to say anyone should test drive a Cirrus before buying any car.  It may be for you, or it may not.  It is a great car and everyone should give it a chance.  Also Chrysler offers a great protection plan for u as well as makes sure you know everything about the car before u buy it or drive it home.  I hope you enjoy this car if you buy one, I know i am!<br><br>
