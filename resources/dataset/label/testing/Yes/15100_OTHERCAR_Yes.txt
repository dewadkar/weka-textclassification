            My husband and I decided to lease the '99 Altima last September.  When we made the decision to lease, we intended to get a mid-size car.  At the advise of a friend, we looked at the Altima, certain that we wouldn't like it because it is a compact car.  Fortunately, we decided to go for the Altima.

For the most part, the car has been extremely reliable and quite comfortable.  During the first month we had the car, it began to experience problems.  Apparently, there was a piece of metal in the engine area that the factory left sitting, and when the car was first started, it caused some damage that didn't surface until we began to drive it.  We immediately called the dealer and within two days, somebody flew to our town, gave us a rental car, and repaired the Altima.  It has not given us any problems since.  To top it off, at least two people called from the dealership and Nissan to express their apologies for any inconvenience caused.

The car is very roomy in the front seat. My husband is 6'2&quot; and finds the leg room more than ample.  The back seat if comfortable enough for my two children, but I would question that in a few years, when they grow more.

The pick up is generally good and I find the engine to be fairly quiet for a car of this price range.

The stereo system is good, with AM/FM Radio and a CD Player.  The speakers are average and produce good quality sound.  

Our model has a sun roof and spoiler and is quite sporty.

My complaints are basically minimal with this car.  The compartment on the dash (where you might toss your sunglasses), has no traction, so everything in it comes flying out when you accelerate.  The arm rest (which doubles as a CD holder) is hard on the elbow, especially during a long drive.  Also, the steering wheel doesn't tilt quite low enough for my taste.

Overall, this is a good, reliable car, and is fun to drive.  I would certainly consider another Nissan, maybe even a step to a larger car.<br><br>
