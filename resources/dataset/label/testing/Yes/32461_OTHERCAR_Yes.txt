            This is a good car for the price.  It has a lot of room in the front seats.   You could live in the front there is so much room, but in the back there is not much room at all.  It has a good factory radio and speakers.  They sound really good. It has airbags on both sides.  It has traction control for slippery driving conditions.  This car will get up and go.  It will really fly.    It handles really good too.  It drives really good.  It takes corners good with no body roll, yet the ride is smooth as silk.  You cannot feel the bumps at all.  It is great to take on road trips with two people and it will be very comfortable.  You can not get a better car for this price in this category.<br><br>
