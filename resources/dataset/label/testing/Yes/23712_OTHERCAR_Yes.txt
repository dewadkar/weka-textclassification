            Never thought I would find myself at a KIA dealership.  Having trouble finding the right price on a used car, the price and warranty of the KIA caught my attention.  First drove the Rio, and was less than impressed.  It just plain felt cheap.

The Spectra was a nice step up from the Rio.  More attractive too.  The silver paint is flawless, and I love the clear head and tail light lenses.  The alloy wheels are pretty nice too, but was disappointed when the hub cover fell off on one wheel.  The dealership gladly gave me a new one, no questions asked.

After the break in period, was surprised to find more than expected power.  Certainly nothing to brag about, but was quite pleased to have no trouble getting to 65 by the end of the on ramp.  I am sure my 5 speed trans help the pep a bit, but none the less, it has more power than I expected.

Engine compartment is nicely dressed up.  The dipstick for the anti-freeze is a nice idea - check the coolant when the engine is hot.  Oil dipstick is so highly polished, it is very hard to read with clean oil - I actually painted the tip white so I could read it.  Oil filter is a little hard to get at, but I have had worse.

Pleased to be getting 28/36 MPG, especially since the window sticker only claims 24/32.  Runs and drives great.  A very comfortable car - more than you would expect for what you pay.  Cornering is nothing special, but not unacceptable.  It does have heavy torque steer winding 1st gear around corners.  Wet and snow traction is weak.  Would have liked to see some better rubber instead of the hard compound, high mileage Kumhos.

Included CD player is very impressive.  Built by Infinity for KIA, it packs 164 watts of power, and uses every bit of it.  Unbelievable lows for not having a sub.  Highs are crisp and clean.  Cranks with full bass and does not distort until ridiculous volume levels.

The warranty:  Who could argue with 5 year, 60,000 bumper to bumper and 10 year, 100,000 drivetrain?  Includes 5 year unlimited mileage road side assistance.  Out of town?  KIA will pick up the bill for your food and lodging while your car is repaired.  I have to laugh at Honda's 3/36,000 warranty.  Hondas are great cars - what is the deal?  KIA clearly has confidence in their product.

Never thought I would own a KIA.  I mean, really, a KIA!  HA!  Best car for the money.  Could not but happier with my purchase.  Worth every penny and then some.  As soon as I suck every last bit of life from my '91 Merc, it will be replaced with a KIA Optima.
