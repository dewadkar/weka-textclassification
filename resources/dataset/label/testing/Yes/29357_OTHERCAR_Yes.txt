               The Honda CR-V is by far the best vehicle I have ever driven. The minute I even got in it for the test drive, I fell in love. We were looking at other SUV's prior to the CR-V, but all of them were just priced too high. Then we saw the CR-V and knew that was the SUV for us. The reason we wanted an SUV in the first place was to have a vehicle that would enable us to haul around our large dog, eventual children, and whatever else we may need. Our needs were not to have a large SUV, so this fit us perfectly. 
   The interior is roomy and comfortable. There is plenty of space between the front seats to put larger items on the floor. There is tons of leg room in both the front and back seats. This vehicle drives really smoothly. You don't even feel like you are driving a big bus like you do with a lot of SUVs. It turns tighter than any car I have ever driven. That is one feature we really love. You can get into tight parking spaces or make quick u-turns. All the controls are well placed and convenient to reach. It is a good SUV for anyone. We are extremely pleased with ours. We have had our CR-V for 2 years now, and had no problems what-so-ever.
