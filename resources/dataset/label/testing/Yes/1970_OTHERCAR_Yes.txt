            Well, back in July of 1999 I was on my way to buy a Volkswagon Passat when I stumbled across a Nissan Dealer across the street. I figured I'd may as well take a quick look at the Maxima but expected the price to be out of range. To my surprise, the price of the 2000 Maxima SE was about the same as the 1999 Passat with comparable options -with the exception that the Maxima had a V6 as opposed to a turbo 4. I also weighed in heavily the Maxima's record of reliability and the rest is history. 

The car's greatest asset is the motor -rated as one of the top V6's in the industry. When you mate it with a 5 speed and the sporty handling of the SE model you are going to have some fun. This car has a lot of power and will keep up with just about anything on the road. I must say the manual gearbox could be better, though. It is quite notchy, especially between second and third gear, and takes some getting used to. Also, despite the front wheel drive, I do not like the way the car handles in the snow. In all fairness, this may improve greatly with a good set of snow tires (which I haven't tryed yet).

When I first bought the car I thought the exterior styling overall was nice and sporty, despite the strange rear end. When the new Altima came out I couldn't help but to think "that is what my Maxima should look like". 

The Interior styling, with the cab-forward dash, is very nice and roomy. The ergonomics are pretty good and the seats are comfortable and supportive. There seems to be some driveline hum at highway speeds -don't remember it being that loud when I first bought the car.

The car, with over 53,000 miles now, has been very reliable. I have had one problem which is quite annoying, though. When the engine is cold and at a certain RPM (around 2000) the fuel will cut out and the car will buck abruptly. Once the engine is warm it is fine. I have yet to bring it into the dealer to have it checked out -I just make sure I get that engine warmed up real quick!

If you are looking for a car to make both you and the family happy, this just may be the one.
