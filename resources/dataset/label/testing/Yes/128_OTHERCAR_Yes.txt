            As one new to digital imaging, I did some research on the MX-1200 which caught my eye due to the high resolution and low price.  After reading all positive reviews, we decided to give a try.  GREAT results.  Fuji offers a mail-in rebate for a diskreader or USB reader (your choice) and local retailers offered a 16MB card free.  So, the camera came with enough memory to take enough pictures without laying out more cash.  The camera is simple to operate and a snap to use.  You can select between resolution and detail, and the color viewer on the back provides clear previews.  Transferring the images to your PC is easy, but the cardreader is a must.  Uploading from your camera itself eats batteries quick.  The software packages with the camera is good and makes printing easy.  Photos look good, and with practice I'm sure will look better.

The compact size and price of the MX 1200 made it a great deal for me, and the free accessories sealed it.  Battery drain is a bit of a problem, so rechargables are in order for any serious picture takers.  Purchased at around $279, it sure worked for me!<br><br>
