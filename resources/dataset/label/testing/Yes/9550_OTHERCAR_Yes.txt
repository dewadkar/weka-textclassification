            Let's forget, for a moment, all the hoopla about the 10-lap pro/celebrity race that introduced the redesigned Toyota Celica.  Read the story of a new mother, friend of mine, who refuses to let go of her 1982 Toyota Celica even though she has always wanted to have a newer vehicle.

This woman has grown attached to her Celica.  Over the years, she has driven this car to all her classes and jobs.  According to her own words, it has been good to her.  It never let her down.  All she needed to do was care about its proper maintenance.  She changed the oil, filters, and added gas.  She was always ready to take off.  The more I think about her story, the the more I understand that what made her such a fan was the reliability of the Toyota Celica.  

Let's jump to the Toyota Celica 7th generation.  We find the well-redesigned, dazzling Celica that most young people rave about.  The 10-lap race of the Long Beach Grand Prix was a showcase that saw some big names of the film and music industries.  George Lucas and Ashley Judd were there to race.  And so did John Elway.  There were many other participants.  Barbara Streissand's stepson, Josh Brolin, ended up winning the race.  What better symbolism he represented!  Youth, speed, and slickness are qualities and subtle messages that the updated version of the Toyota Celica conveys to its hip and young buyers.

<b>What makes this car so appealing?</b>

First things first, you can find this vehicle in two models, GT and GT-S.  Most likely, you will want to go with the GT-S.  The GT-S model comes with 6 speed in comparison with the base sport GT's 5 speed.  In fact, the GT-S is more powerful and sportier.
