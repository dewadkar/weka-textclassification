            I love my Chevy Malibu!!  I am leasing this vehicle with the option to buy at the end of my lease in 3 years.  What I love about this vehicle is the overall performance.  It's V6 engine is very powerful, yet great on gas (in NY the gas prices are through the roof) which is a major plus. It has anti-lock brakes, roomy bucket seats, easy access radio and tape deck, all heating and A/C controls are easy access as well. The daytime running lights are wonderful as well, you will never wake up to a dead battery again by forgetting to turn off your lights!  The trunk is very large, another plus for me, large enough for the car &quot;stuff&quot; (oil, fluids, emergency kits) and the food shopping!  This car handles great in the rain and snow, it really holds the road.  Driving is sheer pleasure, it is that comfortable.
My only regret is that I did not lease this car with power windows or door locks.  I feel this is a must for the four doors.  It is difficult to open the doors manually in the rear.  So spend the extra dough and get power everything.
I feel this is more of a family of four or five car.  It will fit this many, two adults and three children or four adults comfortably.  My boyfriend is 6'3&quot; and fits well, we have driven over an hour with no discomfort to his legs.
Once again, Chevy has made another great car, but that's my opinion.<br><br>
