            I bought my 1990 Miata in 1994, a year before I graduated from college.  My parents made the down payment as my graduation gift, and my payments were only about $240 a month.  We did this even before I graduated because it was such a great car, and they were going to give me a down payment nine months later anyway.

I didn't have any major problems until this past year, when I had to replace the cooling and brake systems.  This was a fortune for someone like me--a graduate student still looking forward to getting a &quot;real&quot; job someday.  But I did it anyway, because I plan to keep the car for several more years.  This is especially true now that it's completely paid for.

This car is so fun to drive, especially on warm days (even in November, I had the top down yesterday).  It handles incredibly well and I feel that I'm in complete control (I think the stick shift adds to this feeling).  I did have an accident several years ago, but the car held up well and was not completely crushed the way some people worry about small cars.

The seats are comfortable, and if we're driving a long distance my husband and I usually opt to take my car, because it makes a road trip much more of an adventure.  The top is easy to put down and take up.  I would, however, recommend zipping out the back plastic window before putting the top down.  I just replaced it for the second time.  My previous window lasted five years, but if you don't bend it the plastic will last even longer.

It's true that you can't take many people with you, but this can be a plus sometimes.  If my friends and I are going out for the evening, I never have to be the designated driver.  The trunk won't allow much luggage, but it's perfect for a weekend getaway.<br><br>
