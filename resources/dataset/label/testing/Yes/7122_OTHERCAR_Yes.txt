            I bought this car used.  Well actually it is not even broken in, but still it is new.  The 1999 is very different for me.  I bought this car not knowing how to drive a 5 speed.  It makes no sense but I wanted a stick.  I learned and mastered within a matter of weeks.  The car is a ton of fun.  It has great handling and whipping around corners is a blast.  The top is extremely easy to put down....literally throw it back.  The engine is loud but that is to be expected as it is a roadster.  I have black after market leather and I have burnt myself a few times so far.  I love leather but no the burn.  Just as expected there is no room in the trunk but I find the shelf behind the seats to be useful when the top is up.  The stereo that comes in the car has got to go.  I bought one after market that is great.  Because the engine is so loud you need a good sound system plus if the top is down you don't want to hear the guy beside you jamming to Hanson.<br><br>
