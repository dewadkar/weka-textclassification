            The Jeep Cherokee is, in my opinion, the greatest driving machine I have ever been in. This Jeep is good for everyone from the big family man to the loner. With it's spacious interior, it is a perfect place for the kids to play and be comfortable on long trips. This is also good if you are a mobster and you need to put a bunch of dead bodies in the back. There is plenty of room for that, not that I condone that kind of behavior. Anyway. The Jeep Cherokee is great for not only onroad, but offroad too! So if you want to go riding in the middle of the woods for some strange reason, go ahead, I dont care, as long as I'm not in the woods at the same time, but if I was, I wouldnt be so worried, because the Cherokee has great brakes.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy your car, and dont forget to recommend my opinion. Thank you very much
