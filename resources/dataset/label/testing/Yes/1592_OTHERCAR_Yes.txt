            What a hassle free fun and reliable car. 
It's great for distance commuters such as myself. 
I travel a total of 111 miles a day commuting 
to and from work, and I wouldn't want to do it 
in any other car but my Geo Prizm.

We bought our 94' Geo Prizm in 97' &quot;USED&quot; for 
around 8,000 with 45,000 miles on it. Not a bad 
deal, everything was in working order, no annoying 
creeks or squeaks when we drove it. And it wasn't 
too sore on the eyes either, actually mine looks 
pretty sporty since it's Black with a little Gray 
pinstripe down the sides. Also a nice feature I like
is that It is really roomy in the front, I never feel
cramped which allows me to enjoy my commute.

Now for the test....how long is it going to 
last with me driving it so much?

I'm happy to report that as of now I have not had 
to take my car into the shop for any fixes <i>(Thank God!)</i>.
Currently my odometer reads 103,000 and it's still
ticking. We've had it through 3 winters and it's never
stalled because of the cold. Actually, the only time 
it's ever stalled was when I was still getting used
to the standard transmission and had a couple of 
<b>embarrassing</b> moments at a red light.  

I enjoy having my 5 speed Standard Transmission because
of the freedom it gives me to gain speed at my pace 
and also to opt to shift it in neutral (great gas saver)
so I can coast to stop signs and red lights. It is so great
on the Interstate, this little car always has an itch
to go fast, and makes it seem effortless. The speed 
limit on our Interstate is 75 mph, and that's just not
fast enough for my car, I really have to watch the 
speedometer because before I know it I'm going around
85 mph. I've discussed this phenomena with another owner
of a Geo Prizm (a mechanic none the less) and he finds the
same to be true. The car likes speed, what can I say.
The gas mileage is pretty good, in my commute I spend 
half of the 111 miles on the interstate and the other 
half in the city. So averaging it out I get about 
37 miles per gallon. 

I think it's very important to be vigilant about changing
your oil every 3,000 miles. I have made it a habit to make
that a must-do for my car. Also about every 3 fill-ups I 
add a fuel injector cleaner to my gas tank. 

And for my Geo's 100,000 mile progress report from the 
mechanic, the only thing that he recommended was that
I have all the belts changed. Hey, I'm not complaining, 
that is nothing major, and the total cost of the parts
will only be $75 (it's the cost of the labor that kills ya).

The only complaint that I do have about my car, is that my
radio died. But hey, the tape player still works so I'll
survive.

I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a low 
maintenance, highly dependable fun little car that will
last you for miles and miles.
