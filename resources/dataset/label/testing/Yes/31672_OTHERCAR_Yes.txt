            This is the fourth van I have purchased in the past 12 years.  I have enjoyed the space allowed in a van.  I first started with vans to carry my grand daughters and my square dance friends.  It has enough room for stretching the legs, relaxing on the couch in the back, or putting down the bed for a good nights rest.  I purchased my current 1998 Chevrolet instead of a pickup so I can pull a l9' trailer.  It has so much more interior room and the cost is near the same.  It is really a truck in disguise.  There is a distinct advantage to driving a pickup or a van.  You sit so much higher and can see what is happening ahead of you. Since I have driven a van, I do not want to drive a regular car any more.  <br><br>
