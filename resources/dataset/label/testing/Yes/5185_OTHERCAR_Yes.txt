            The 1998 Honda Accord EX Coupe with the 150HP 4-cylinder engine is a very sweet car.  Handling is typical for a Honda - excellent.  The exhaust note is a bit different from my last Accord (a 1990 EX coupe) - more bass and less of the high pitch turbine whine.  When the engine is cold it sounds a bit pedestrian - reminds me of a Ford Escort.   However, once warmed up the sound improves dramatically.  Acceleration is spirited even with an automatic transmission (which shifts much better than my 1990).  

The interior instument layout is one of the better I've seen - I'm a fan of the big center speedometer with two smaller tach and fuel/temp guages flanking it.  The center stereo and heater control are BIG - no way one can pick the wrong button.  Front room is fine but the rear seat has a bit less room than the 1990.  One bug is that the front seat release does not have a memory feature, requiring one to reset the seat slide adjuster every time someone wants to get into the back seat.  On the positive side the trunk is large and very, very usable.  Liftover height is rather high, but getting suitcases into the opening is no problem.

As for build quality, I've only had one problem requiring dealer service - the power sunroof (which both tilts and slides back) rattled when I bought the car.  This was immediately fixed (a untightened bracket screw).  The sunroof is another small shortcoming of the car - the opening size is substantally less than my 1990 due to the more sharply slopping roof.  Unlike many coupe's this sunroof retracts within the confines of the car, making the exterior view better when the sunroof is retracted.  

My car is black with a charcoal cloth interior and has the typical carwash spotting problems of black cars. 

The Accord Coupe starting in 1998 is a completely different sized car than the 4-door.  It has a shorter wheelbase and shares virtually no exterior panels.  This is a car for people without small kids - 20-somethings and 50-somethings who want a bit of exclusiveness (only 5-10% of Accords sold are the Coupe version in a very affordable package (~$20,000 new).<br><br>
