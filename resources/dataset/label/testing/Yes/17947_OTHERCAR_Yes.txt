            Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever imagined I would be a Jeep Wrangler owner, but I am.  And I am not sure if my life will ever be the same without one now.

I have always been a compact car driver; someone who looks for the economical and practical vehicle.

When I turned 24, I wanted something different.  So, I traded my Nissan Sentra for a Camaro convertible.

I loved the convertible.  It was neat to drive and be 'one with nature' as I drove.  But when winter came and I needed to get to my job regardless of inclement weather, I was stuck with a Camaro, which sits almost flat on the road.

I could not face parting with my convertible, so I did the crazy thing and bought a 4-Wheel Drive Toyota truck.  This worked out fine until I was tired of paying two car payments, two insurance payments, two inspection charges, two license charges, and so on, and so on.

Therefore, I began searching for something new to replace both vehicles.  I wanted a convertible, but I wanted a 4-wheel drive also.  Then I met the Jeep Wrangler personally for the first time.

This was a 1998 Chili Pepper Red Jeep Wrangler Sport.  It had solid doors with roll-up glass windows.  It had A/C, it was an automatic, and it was my dream car.  I got to keep a 'convertible' but also a 4-wheel drive.  My life was complete.

Jeep Wrangler took a year off from production in 1996 to build a different type of Wrangler.  Most 'veteran' Jeep Wrangler fans do not like the new Jeeps from 1997 on, because they say they drive too much 'like a car'.  The true veterans think they should ride stiff and that they were not built for comfort, but for true off-road capability.

I, on the other hand, like the off-road capability, but also appreciate the new suspension and the comfort of driving a new Jeep Wrangler.

The top on the new Jeep is lots easier to remove than the older models.  You simply unclasp the hooks above the front glass, remove the side back windows, and lay the top back.  Not like the older Jeeps where you have to unbutton for days to remove the top.

The gas mileage on my Jeep is roughly 15-17 mpg.  I do some highway driving, but the majority of my driving is stop and go and urban streets.

Maintenance costs are low, and cleaning this vehicle takes a lot less time than a large SUV or other larger car, especially with one that does not have a hard top.

The few things that I am not 100% satisfied with in regards to Jeep Wranglers are:

   1) You don't have doors for the back seat, which forces anyone
      riding with you to climb over everyone to get in.

   2) The top, although easier than the older models to remove,
      is lots harder than convertible cars are to remove.  With
      cars, most convertible tops are automatic.  You would 
      think Jeep would someday come out with some solution to
      make the tops automatically remove.

   3) You cannot store large things in them.  Putting groceries,
      TV's, large boxes, etc., becomes a small task, since you 
      don't have a hatchback or back doors.  You have to open
      the front doors, pull them up, and lean into the back
      to store these.  Most larger boxes will not go through
      the small opening between the front door and a leaned up
      seat.  For example, I bought a computer a year ago, and
      had to take the top completely down, put the computer
      boxes in the back seat, and then put the top back up,
      before I could get the boxes in the Jeep.

I would recommend the Jeep Wrangler to people of all ages.  Teens love them, but the new ones with a lot of options are sometimes costly.  People in mid to late 20's enjoy them, but I would not limit this vehicle to just that age.  I have seen all ages drive them, and I work with several older men who have been Jeep owners for years and years.  I know that I, too, will someday be looked at as an old-time Jeep owner, because my experience with my new Jeep has been wonderful.<br><br>
