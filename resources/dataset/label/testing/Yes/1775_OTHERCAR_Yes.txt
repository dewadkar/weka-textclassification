            What can one say about a convertible.  Convertibles are far more enjoyable and exciting to drive than closed cars.  I love this car.  It is fun, quick, handles competently and is very comfortable.  I took it on a couple of highway trips with the top down 75 mph and watched the mileage gauge hold fairly steady at 30 mpg.  That is amazing!  With a 168 hp 2.5L V-6 and an automatic transmission I would expect much lower mileage with the top down.  Convertibles have horrid wind resistance.  I have trouble driving my closed car after spending a few weeks with this car.  It has a great sound system, audible at highway speeds.  The wind noise at legal speeds (65 mph) is acceptable, normal tone conversation is possible.  It has great acceleration around town, although wind resistance makes country road passing a bit of a chore.  The automatic transmission shifts smoothly and beautifully, although it may not in a pre-1996 car, as this predates a much needed transmission redesign.  The top is excellent with smooth, albeit loud operation and NO leaks.  Ever.  The top does require care as it is canvas, but spraying it with stain blockers now and again does the trick.  The cover for the top when it is down is almost useless as it is slow and clumsy to put on or take off.  The seats are comfortable although the back seat is a little cramped.<br><br>
