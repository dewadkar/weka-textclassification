            This is a great camera for MOST digital photos that you'll ever take. Very easy to use, small enough to carry anywhere and great photos whether you print them or not. 

I first this camera on a trial basis for two weeks, took lots of photos and had some printed. The results were amazing to say the least. If you can afford the price, this is the camera to get!!

I use a 64 MB CF card and don't ever run out of room, the battery works quite well and I recharge whenever possible so that I don't run out of juice.

Also, I bought a nice LEATHER original accessory case for it from Henry's of Toronto Canada via the web for about $20!<br><br>
