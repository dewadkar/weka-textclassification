             I have owned a 2000 Kia Sephia since October of 1999.  It has thus far been very reliable and everything I could have hoped for in a car.  Up until the time I bought my Sephia I had driven used cars.  I am a recent college graduate who now works and pays off student and now car loans. 

 With everything said and done the car cost $10,500 with minimal options (powersteering, AM/FM cassette radio) chosen.  I get great gas mileage on and off the highway.  The seats are comfortable and washable (nacho cheese was spilt and it came right out).  There is plenty of head and leg room and the front seats have adjustable head rests which are a little testy when you try and get them back down again.  The Sephia offers many little storage spaces in the console and on the dashboard making it a haven for nosey people.  There is a good deal of trunk space which can be opened from the inside of the car, just be careful not to open the gas tank instead.  The performance is great.  I have a 5 speed manual transmission that I had to learn on and I'm still driving with the original clutch!  

 On the flip side I did not have the greatest experience purchasing this car.  The dealership was not willing to go the extra mile to fix the problems that they caused.  However, there is new staff and management at the facility at which I bought my car.  

 The car itself has been great.  I bought it basically because I just wanted a new car.  It's my first new car and it was purchased on a very tight budget.  I was surprised however, to find what were considered options.  Powersteering, floor mats and a radio were all options.  I know I'm still new at this but I do think that some of these things should be standard on new cars.  The only problem that has been noticed with this car with my experience is when I brought it to have its oil changed my mechanic had a problem getting the oil filter out.  So, unless you do your own oil changes it isn't anything to fret over.  

 I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for an affordable compact car.  I have had three young children in the back seat at one time with one in a regular car seat, one in a booster seat and one wearing a seatbelt.  It was probably a little tight for the third child but just fine for the other two.  So far so good!  Until I face a major problem I would recommend this car to just about anyone I know.<br><br>
