            I am married with a teenage daughter and five year old step son.  We are very involved in outdoor activities and love to fish, hunt, golf, camp, sight see and just about everything else you can do outside.  We had been wanting a truck for several years because of the durability, but we liked the roominess of cars.  We found both in our Jimmy.  We have the SLT (sport leather trim) and we just LOVE IT.  We just toss the kids and the fishing poles or golf clubs in the back and take off.  Lots of versatility, plus it looks great.  Like having a car and truck all in one. I don't think we could ever go back to just a car again.<br><br>
