            I got my Diamante very used at an age of 9 years & 147K miles.  I now have 152K miles and have driven through several states with the car.  I have had an AC leak repaired, sunroof leak repaired (moved car from Phoenix to Seattle), and new front brakes installed since getting the car. Over $1000 in 5000 miles is not very promising, but the engine is very strong (per two different mechanics).  The sunroof on the car is an aftermarket unit so I don't fault Mitsubishi on that either.  The transmission shifts abruptly at times (or as a friend who has a Mercedes describes such behavior, "with authority"), and care must be taking when repairing brakes (see http://www.geocities.com/diamanteowner/) but other than that the car is a joy to drive.  Very quiet, smooth, and has plenty of power.  Handling is above par, the car holds the corners.  All Diamante models are exceptionally well equipped, even without any options.  And the styling is some of the most distinctive and good-looking in this class (especially for the car's age).  Beware tall people.  I am 6-2 and *just* fit in the car.  Head room is very scarce requiring one to recline their seat eliminating already scare rear leg room.

Overall, have been very pleased with it.  I have an extensive service history from the one previous owner which also helps put me at ease.  Of course, if I drop the transmission tomorrow I won't be so happy... : )  I would give the D a solid recommendation as a used car, any year you are looking at.  I will certainly give it my consideration in 1-3 years when I am looking for another car.
