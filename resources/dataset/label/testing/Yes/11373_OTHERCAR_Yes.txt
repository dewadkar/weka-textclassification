            My wife and I purchased a 1999 Grand Caravan ES in September 1999. It has all of the options except for a block heater and ashtrays. We looked at the underpowered Mazda MPV, the Honda Oddysey, the Ford Windstar, and Toyota Sienna. The Dodge beat them all in comfort and features.

We enjoy the heated leather seats, the ride, the tri-coat paint, the 17&quot; wheels, and the power from the 3.8 liter engine, AutoStick transmission, and steering wheel audio controls.

I was somewhat disappointed with the quality. This van spent some time in the shop to fix: paint drips on all doors, rear window washer installed upside-down, and poor fit of interior plastic parts.

In retrospect we would still buy the same van. I am afraid of the long-term aspects of this van so I opted for the extended warranty.<br><br>
