            I purchased my 99 Monte Carlo in February of 99...the reason I started looking at Monte Carlo's is because I am a BIG Dale Earnhardt fan...sounds foolish, but the truth is I love GM and I love That good ole number 3 on race day. So off I went..after searching 4 dealerships I finally found my Black Beauty. Of course the dealership had closed for the night..so I called them the next day and 45 minutes later I was in my car...I wouldn't recommend buying the way I did...over phone sight unseen, but I would recommend the 99 Monte Carlo to any woman, who like me, has a family and needs room but also likes the handling of a Sports car. My Black beauty is the LS model, it has everything you need and more. The performance of the 3.1 v6 engine is excellent, and the ride is extremely comfortable. And to my surprise the front wheel drive makes it great in the snow...I know that I will keep this ride for awhile..and I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
