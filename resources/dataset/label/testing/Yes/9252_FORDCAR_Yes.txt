            I purchased a 2000 Ford Contour as my first new vehicle last week.  The worst part about this car is it isn't available anymore.  Ford decided to kill the Escort and Contour and replace them with the new Focus.  I drove a Focus for a day while my Contour was being detailed at the dealer.  There is no comparison between these cars.  The Focus is a great replacement for the Escort, but isn't nearly nice enough to replace the Contour, anyhow, this is a Contour review, not a Focus review.

I'd always liked the Contours but they seemed a little pricey to get them configured how I wanted them.  I stumbled across the deal at the local Ford dealer while looking around.  They only had 2 regular Contours left and were giving some pretty tremendous discounts.  The end price I ended up financing with tax, title, $1000 of negative equity from my last car and everything was $1500 less than sticker. Fairly close if not just below invoice I believe.

Anyhow, the actual car is great, the V6 has plenty of power (170 hp) and the manual transmission complements it well and doesn't rob any power like the auto tranny does.  The ride is great, very quiet, handles well, all controls are easy to find and use.  Very refined overall for a smaller car.  I read lots of reviews before buying and nearly all the reviews were quite favorable, with the only complaints being minor ones.

My only complaints are small, but may affect other people more:
Trunk lid area and seals- put together poorly from factory.  Blatantly easy to see where some sealant was just poured and globbed into a body seam and painted over. The underside of the trunk lid is painted the body color, but looks like just 1 coat and no polishing.  The armrest and console compartment below are a little odd.  The armrest seems to high and/or too small.  You can rest on it easily, but it seems a little awkward.  The armrest covers a large compartment below it, but isn't really a lid for it, it kind of gets in the way.  The compartment is deep and it's a bit odd to lean over and see what's in the compartment.
If you look at the car from the side you can see the fold and the spot welds below the doors.  It looks cheap and could have been covered easily as they are on the SVT model.

So the gripes are small and picky, but they're there.  The gripes for the focus would be more plentiful.   As the main functions of the car goes, it's great, the power and handling are good, the ride is as fine as many more expensive cars.

If you're looking to buy one new, go right now, you might be able to find one.  I checked about 6 different dealerships in 3 towns, and none had more than 2 or 3 in stock of the regular contours, some had a few SVT's, the sportier version of the contour.  

So try one out if you're looking at anything in this small sedan class, if you can find one, you won't be dissapointed.<br><br>
