            The 1999 Ford Contour is a decent mid-sized car.  The base model runs about $16,000, and does not come with many options.  More standard options would make this price tag more attractive.  However, the car is roomy and the seats are comfortable.  The sound system is okay, but not exceptional.  The speakers are located in the doors, which detracts from the sound quality.  This is probably done because of the dual airbags.  The gas mileage is economically sound.  I recently took a 900 mile trip in the contour, and spent thirty dollars on gas.  The ride was comfortable for the entire trip.  The trunk is expansive with ample room for luggage. The sticker price is not unreasonable for a mid-size car, but could certainly offer more included options.
