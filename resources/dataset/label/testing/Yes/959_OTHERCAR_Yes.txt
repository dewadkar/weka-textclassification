            The new Corvette puts my old Corvette to shame, I must admit.  They are beautiful and highly powerful.  Of course, this should come as no surprise to anybody familiar with the popularity of &quot;America's Favorite Sports Car.&quot;By now, most are probably familiar with the new design of the Corvette.  Although the lines are still classic, and somewhat familiar, the new vette is no replica of the &quot;old dog.&quot;  There are some improvements to say the least.  The new Vette sports a hefty 375 horse-powered engine under the hood.  Radically different, is the suspension, the interior, and absent, are several design flaws that the previous older model Vettes possessed.For instance, the new suspension makes for a smoother ride, the once tiny trunk space has been made roomier. plus the overall performance is undeniably impressive.  For around $40,000 you can experience an an American legend that, in my opinion as a Corvette owner, still has the stuff that dreams are made of. I may only have an '84 model, but it maybe someday, I will move on up!                      <br><br>
