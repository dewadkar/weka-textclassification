            I recently purchased this car - 180hp TT Roadster with Performance Package, Bose Audio System, and Power Top.

At $37,200, this car is a relative deal. This is a beautiful car that handles well and embodies everything that I want in a fun, quasi-luxury, convertible.  The nice thing about the TT is that it has a distinctive look without being overly flashy.  While I thought about the 225 for the extra power - I have not missed it at all (there is more than enough punch to get me quickly into Silicon Valley traffic).

Regarding the purchasing:  We bought this through the Internet and paid MSRP, though the dealers were telling us there was a supposedly $5,000 dealer markup (don't believe them).

Surprisingly, trunk space in the TT is not bad and is bigger than comparable convertibles.  However, storage within the car is minimal - you can probably store 10 CD cases within all the storage compartments!  

The best part of the car is its design - clean and modern - though not always intuitive (the heating dials are kinda weird at first).
