            I love my 2000 Hyundai Accent. At the time I purchased my Hyundai Accent, I was in a car accident two months previous and I needed a reliable, vehicle for a good price and I did not have much time to shop around. I did some research on the Hyundai Accent online and it appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. 

I purchased it used in 2001 with low mileage and not even a year old. I was skeptical at first because I wanted a brand new one. But after test driving the 2000 Hyundai Accent GL Sedan, I was very impressed with the smooth ride and great handling. It gets even better. After I purchased it I found the gas mileage to be amazingly economical. There is a lot to be said for a car that does not break you every time you have to fill the tank! I have owned several small cars and this by far is the best gas mileage yet. 

Even though I purchased it used, I still had over 40,000 miles left on the warranty and I still have 30,000 miles to go. I have not had to use the warranty though as the car has caused me no problems, (I have owned it for 10 months so far) just regular maintenance and it runs like a dream. 

The interior of the GL sedan is more spacious than you would think by looking at it from the outside. It is quite roomy inside. My father, who is 6'2", 230lbs has driven it and seems to have ample room. The back seat is roomy and comfortable and it folds down for extra cargo space extending the trunk space. The exterior is not sleek or fancy but it is cute and it suits me just fine.

The 2000 Hyundai Accent GL Sedan comes standard with a 4 cyl. 1.5 liter engine, 5-speed manual transmission, dual front air bags, power steering, power brakes, center console, aluminum alloy wheels, intermittent wipers, rear window defroster, remote trunk release, tachometer, tinted glass, cloth seats and AM/FM Stereo Cassette. 

My car has air conditioning (which works very well...and I live in Sunny Arizona with summer temps that reach 118 plus degrees on average) and automatic 4 speed transmission which are options. The pick up is quite impressive for this small engine.  The only problem I encountered with performance was driving on an incline with the air conditioning on. It has adequate pick up for in town driving.    

I would highly recommend the Hyundai Accent GL Sedan. 
My next purchase will definitely be another Hyundai.
