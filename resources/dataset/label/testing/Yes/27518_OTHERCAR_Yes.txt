            I bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo ('96) after I test drove it May '99.  My ten year old Sentra finally quit working and there was no easy way to fix it, so I spent Memorial Weekend searching for a newer car.  

I was sold on the Grand Cherokee because of its comfortable interior, dependable engine, size, and price.  It was leased previously and only had 23,000 miles on it.  Now it has 42,000.  

This is a great car to drive, very smooth.  I had to get an alignment and 4 new tires, but it doesn't wander now.  The only thing I hate is the 23 gallon gas tank. It gets about 380 miles before the gas light comes on and I do a lot of highway driving.  

I would tell someone who has to haul things around for a living to get this SUV.  The space in back is great and there are D rings to attach bungy chords so your things won't move around.  I also got a trunk protector for the back so I wouldn't destroy the interior. If you need to drive 4 people somewhere, there is plenty of room in the back seat to stretch out.  

If you just live and work in the city, don't get this SUV.  Parallel parking (although I've done it) isn't that easy.  The gas mileage is bad and narrow roads worry me.  

But for long trips it is wonderful.  The only other bad thing is my friends always want me to drive (but I don't mind that much).  Every time I get in my Grand Cherokee to go somewhere I think about how much I love my car.
