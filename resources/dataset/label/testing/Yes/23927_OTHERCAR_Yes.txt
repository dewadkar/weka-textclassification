            After 5-days and 500 miles with my new 2001 SLK 230, I continue to be very impressed with this vehicle.  My car has the 6-speed manual transmission, and only two options - the dealer installed CD changer, and the K1 package, which includes power 8-way seats, and manual telescoping steering wheel.  I paid $38,800 plus tax, title and license.

I had not had an opportunity to drive the 230 with a 6-speed before ordering, but my impression from driving the 5-speed was that the 6-speed would be okay.  This has been confirmed.  The transmission shifts easily, but doesn't have a great feel to it, compared to the Honda S2000 for example.  Throws are short, but the engagement is a little rubbery, not a satisfying snick.  However, I have not found this to be a serious detractor from driving fun. 

Handling is way better than acceptable, although the quick steering needs some getting used to.  I overcontrolled this vehicle at first.  Road holding is great, but I've noticed a little more body roll than I expected.  Nothing extreme, but an obvious compromise has been made between performance and comfort - one that I'm in favor of since this is now my daily commuter.

The engine is smooth and surprisingly powerful, thanks to the supercharger.  This car won�t plaster you into the seat like a Corvette will, but it does provide a good kick.  Acceleration seems brisker than the 2000 SLK with the 5-speed, but whether this is due to the marginal increase in horsepower in the 2001 model, or the 6-speed transmission, I don�t know.  On a drive down CA Highway 1, I was able to pass slower traffic at will in the short passing zones, something that I can�t do in my Audi A6.

Styling of the 2001 non-sport model is vastly improved over the 2000 model.  The fake carbon fiber panels in the interior are gone, replaced with attractive engine-turned aluminum.  The exterior has a better looking front-end, and much better body-colored rocker panel covers.  In my opinion, the sport package on the 2000 was not worth the money, and this is even more true of the 2001 model.  One disappointment is that some of the plastic interior parts exhibit excess plastic flashing, not something you�d expect from M-B.

Comfort is great.  I�m a little over 6-foot, and this is the only roadster that I fit in comfortably, top up or down.  It took a little fiddling with the power seats and the telescoping steering wheel, but once I got things dialed in, I was very comfortable.  I�m sure that I�d have no trouble driving this car all day.  It would be nice if the car had memory seats, since my Wife will be driving the car too, but this isn�t available.  One aerodynamic flaw is annoying. With the top up, there is a turbulent noise that starts at around 45 MPH and seems to come from the B-pillar area.  It sounds like a piece of cellophane flapping in the breeze.  It�s not terribly loud, but you can hear it.

So far, I�d recommend this car to anyone looking for a roadster.  If I start experiencing maintenance problems, I might have to reconsider that.  For now, however, I�m impressed with the 2001 SLK 230s combination of performance, price, and looks.
