            I considered buying a Toyota Camry prior to deciding on a 2000 Dodge Neon ES.  This car has all the features of the Camry for about $8,000 less.  With all the additional options like remote entry and anti-theft system, 4-disc CD changer, and power sunroof, this car is sporty and fun to drive.  It handles like a sports car and is very comfortable.  Even better than a sports car, it is very fuel efficient.  Anyone that wants to drive a sports car without a sporty price should seriously consider the 2000 Neon ES.  There is a surprising amount of room even in the back seat, so a family of four can comfortably ride in this car.<br><br>
