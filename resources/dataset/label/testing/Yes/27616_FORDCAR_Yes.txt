            I wanted a new SUV to carry all my stuff (and the new kid's stuff!).  Being that I am 6'7" tall, I really had to find one that would comfortably fit me.  I went to every car dealer I could find and said "Hi, I'm here to try on an SUV".  I sat in almost every mid-sized SUV on the market and the Ford Escape definitely fits me the best.  The Honda CRV specs say that it has more interior cargo space than the Escape but I don't know where they put it.  I find the Escape to be much more spacious - and have a less "cheesy" interior than the CRV too!

Once I decided to get an SUV, I figured I'd have to accept that I would be filling the gas tank every few days.  With this one, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was getting 24-25 mpg with my old Grand-Am and am currently getting 21-22 mpg in the Escape.  Much better than the 15 mpg I was expecting.  And, I don't seem to have to sacrifice any power.  This engine is one of the most powerful in its class and I have no problems passing someone when I need to.

As for luxury type items, I didn't get the 4X4 option.  I live in Maryland and since we don't get too much snow, I didn't really think I needed it.  I have no intentions of using this vehicle off-road so I didn't get it.  I did get the moon-roof option which works quite nicely.  I wanted to get the upgraded sound system, but since it was unavailable I accepted the standard system and just figured I'd upgrade things if I saw a reason.  I think its a good idea if you get the moon-roof to go with the upgraded sound system.  With the moon-roof open, depending upon what I am listening to, even maximum volume isn't enough.  That's not to say that the ride is loud.  Its more than the wind deflection is loud.

The only downside I've found so far, and its really trivial, is that I was surprised with a $10 upcharge when I got my first oil change.  This SUV uses 5W-30 as its standard oil and that creates the cost difference.  Not a big deal, but something to note anyway.

Overall, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  It had some early problems with recalls but that seems to have worked out.  I highly suggest considering it if you are tall and are looking into an SUV.
