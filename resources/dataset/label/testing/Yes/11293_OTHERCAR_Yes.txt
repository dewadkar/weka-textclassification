            My wife and I were in the market for two new cars to replace her 90 Daihatsu Charade (120k) and my 93 Plymouth Voyager (235k). After trying the Matrix, Corolla, Echo, and Golf we decided on the Toyota Matrix but couldn't get a good deal and had a hard time getting the options we wanted. Maybe we'll come back to the Matrix when there's a better selection, but we turned to the Protege5 and have been extremely happy. 

We decided that it would replace the Daihatsu as my wife's primary car. It has definitely been a step up in available passenger and cargo space, in addition to the zippy pick-up and sporty handling. As an alternative to my minivan, the Protege5 is smaller but much more fuel-efficient and fun! 

Compared to the Matrix, we made a small sacrifice in gas efficiency and cargo space as well as the Ultra-Low Emmissions. However, we got a great deal on a Protege5 with standard power windows, doors and mirrors, cruise, and fog lights and optional bumper guard, cargo mat and tape player for less than a bare-bones Matrix without any of that stuff. Why? Because as of May 2002 you will probably pay near MSRP for the Matrix. Nobody is familiar with the Protege5 (maybe because of Mazda's lack of marketing) so there are great deals to be had. I may go back to the Matrix this fall to replace the minivan, but for now we are very happy with the Protege5 as our small-hatchback replacement.

As of May 2002, the only gripe we have with the Protege5 has to do with the tires. I had asked the dealer before purchase about the availability of aftermarket or replacement tires after reading an Edmunds.com customer review where the owner waited a week for a replacement tire after damaging one on a curb. The extremely helpful salesman said that it was a different tire from the normal Protege (due to the sportier handling), but still widely available. 

Five days after car delivery, my wife was visiting Austin, Texas and a tire blew out with an unrepairable two-inch tear in the side.  Sure enough, my wife was stranded in Austin for nearly a week waiting for a replacement tire via the local Mazda dealer because that is the only way you can get a replacement tire right now. 

First of all, I'm not impressed by a tire that blows out after five days in highway and city driving. Furthermore, Austin ain't a small city; it doesn't get easier to find a new tire the farther out in the sticks you get stuck. The cost to replace one tire? Apparently not covered by the standard tire warranty: one hundred fifty dollars. Add to that a week stranded away from home and this might give you pause when considering a new Protege5 purchase in the nearfuture. Although the salesman was extremely helpful, I don't think he was entirely forthright with regards to aftermarket availability, let alone dealer support.

We really love our new Protege5 and I feel we got a really great deal for the money. It's a solid sporty ride with great handling and a comfortable interior. However, if I had it to do over again, we might wait until replacement tires are readily available, and not just at Mazda dealerships. Be sure to ask this question of your dealer.
