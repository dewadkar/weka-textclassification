            The Galant is a very good car indeed.  I now have over 4600 miles on the car.  The first day I drove in it, I was immediately impressed at the solidity of the car, and the quiet, smooth ride.  It's as smooth as an accord, but much cheaper.  As soon as you sit in it and drive off the parking lot, you'll notice the car's solid feel and low noise level, even at highway speeds.

The best features about the car is it's smooth engine, quiet ride, and tight handling. The transmission shifts easily through the gears.  At idling, the engine is difficult to hear it's so quiet.  At high RPM's, it is still relatively quiet. There is some wind noise at highway speed (70+MPH) that enters the cabin, but it's not excessive by any means.

I enjoy driving powerful cars--I used to drive a Pontiac GTP with the supercharged engine...a very powerful engine with excellent acceleration--power is probably one of the most important aspect of a car I look for.  It's a safety issue for me.  I want to be able to merge into traffic or pass a car without fear of getting into a crash because the car wouldn't move like I wanted it to.  You won't have problems with this car.  I'll admit it's not a sports car, but but it's quick enough to merge easily (and safely) into busy traffic on the highway or pass someone who is hogging the road in front of you.  

The car's handling is very good.  The lead foot that I am, I like to drive quickly through turns.  I feel safe doing so in this car.  It is predictable and hugs the road well.

Fuel consumption is good.  Just this week, I got 23.7 miles/gallon.  This was with approximately 50% highway and 50% city driving.

The AC works well.  It gets nasty here in Texas, and it stays comfortable under the torrid sun (I don't have tinted windows).  The heat works great once it gets going, but seems to take a little longer than it should to get going (it doesn't get very cold here, so perhaps someone who lives up North could tell you whether this is a problem or not)

The radio (with CD) works well and is intuitive to use.  The controls are fairly easy to use. The basic radio sounds pretty good.  A CD player comes standard, and has worked flawlessly.

The major drawback of this car:  While front seating is comfortable, the back needs a little more let room.  In addition, it's fairly cumbersome to take a child in and out from the back seat with the car seat in the middle.  This is probably the one big area where this car loses when compared to the Camry or Accord.  Don't buy this car if you plan to have it as your main mode of transportation and you have three teenagers.  However, for the couple with (or without) two small kids (out of car seats), this is a perfect car.  I would hesitate to buy this car if you have more than one kid in a car seat.  It's great as a second car.

Trunk space is fair.  It's a little smaller than the Accord's if I recall correctly.  I haven't had any trouble putting anything in it, to include a (double) baby stroller.  There are attachments for a cargo net, but the net isn't included with the car.  I think Mitsubishi could supply one standard.  After all, it's not that expensive, yet it's a nice feature people want.  The pass through located in the back seat is so narrow, it's essentially useless.  It's only good for a pair of skis or other similarly narrow items.

Problem area:  a door seal was faulty upon delivery of the car--causing some road noise to intrude.  This was fixed easily by the dealer.  No problems since.



Addendum (Sept 2002)

I have now driven this car for almost two years.  No regrets! I'd buy it again!  No mechanical problems either!  No rattles, noises, or leaks.

Concerning the back seat comments previously made:  While the back seat space if small for adults, I have put a baby seat for my 6 month old in the middle, and 2 toddler seats  (one on each side of the car) with no significant difficulties, and was able to get the kids in/out fairly easily.  If you have an infant seat with one of those big handle that folds down, you may have problems fitting the whole thing near the doors without pushing the front seats forward.  However, that's less of a problem if you put this type of seat in the middle.  

My overall assessment of the back seat:  best for toddlers in toddler seats/booster seats and kids up to the age of 13-14 or so.  It's not a comfortable back seat for people with long legs.  It can be hard to fit a baby seat with folding handles.


Still no mechanical problems at 25,000!  

October 2003:  Still doing great.  Now have 36,000 miles.  No problems yet!
