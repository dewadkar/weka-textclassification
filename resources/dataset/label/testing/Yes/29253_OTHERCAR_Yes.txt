            Waxing nostalgic for the great view from a truck (I was raised on a Long Island farm) but not wanting a pickup (3 teenagers with friends), I fell in love with a four-door black 1995 Blazer LS.  Fully automatic, it satisfied my desire for luxury features while giving me the &quot;power boost&quot; of owning a truck.  

We do a lot of driving here on Long Island's suburban sprawl, and I found that a Blazer is perfect for &quot;roughing it,&quot; but cannot provide the comforts that it visually promises.  Taking a trip to Florida was the clue...the two girls in the back were not happy campers (and we stayed in motels!).  

The Blazer is not a luxury car.  The seats have very little cushioning effect, but bounce beautifully (great struts), making the grab bars a very handy feature.  The roll-over threat was avoided by driving responsibly.  Having the automatic seats up high enough for a woman to see clearly enough over the dashboard makes reaching the gas pedal a challenge.  The mechanical problems experienced were typical for a car 2 years old with 100K miles on it, but it did have an electrical problem that took several visits to diagnose.

  It is a great truck for camping, carrying lots of groceries, and bad weather (the 4WD is very user-friendly).  If you use the rear seats, there's not much cargo space, but it has plenty if you don't.  It's attractive, handles smoothly, responding well for a vehicle it's size, and is a workhorse.  

I highly recommend it for every day use by drivers who need it's best features.  At the same time, if you like a smooth ride, and go long distances, the Blazer would be be best used as your second car.  I only needed one...so traded it in for an Oldsmobile.<br><br>
