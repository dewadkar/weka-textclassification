                We shopped around a lot and I believe e found the best car for the money. Me and my wife bought our 1997 dodge intrepid used with 18,000 miles on it . It came with the 3.5 lit. engine ,bucket seats,basic package. To start with the interior room is huge ,interior noise minimal,extreemly comfortable seats front and rear,nice placement of gauges. As far as performance it is very quick when we looked at the different intrepids it also came with the smaller 3.2 lit. engine that I would not reccomend due to a differnce in power. Handling is sharp and controlable as big as the car is it realy handles well. Very good fuel millage in town ok but long distances really great. We had very few problems mechanically . The car has been a great joy to drive I would highly recommend it ... <br><br>
