            I purchased this car in '02 with about 85,000 miles. Loved it from day one. This is the 1990 Honda Prelude S, five speed, the one with dual side-draft carburetors. Not quite as quick as the Si, but a blast to drive nevertheless. I only had one major problem with this car, which was my own fault. The timing belt went out on me while on an interstate. Gotta love those Japanese engineers though; the engine is non-interference, so the cylinders didn't destroy all of my valves. Of course, this should have been prevented if I had replaced the timing belt at 90,000; but you live, you learn.

I get great gas mileage with this car, usually around ~30 mpg. Cargo room is great because of the folding rear seats. I'm 6'1" tall and have room to spare in the driver seat. The passenger seat has considerably less room though, my knees are touching the dash even with the seat in its rear position. Only children will be able to sit comfortably in the rear seats; this is a sports car.

This car is nearly problem free. Runs like a champ and very fun to drive. It handles well even with the skinny 13" pizza cutter tires. It starts well in 20 below Minnesota winters. I only have one concern, it doesn't like to idle very well when it is less than 30 F. May be do to the fact it's carbureted, maybe not.

I've also had a couple very minor problems. Just to the left of the digital clock is a little black cover, this broke off in my car, not a big deal. Also, there is a buzzer in the car which is activated when the doors are closed and your seat belts are not on. Even if you do not connect your seat belt, the buzzer eventually goes away. This buzzer remained on even if seat belts are connected, needless to say I disconnected that promptly. Those are the only problems I have had with this car, which is quite miniscule compared to other cars. My prelude has only treated me right, anyone looking for a great fuel efficient fun car should check one out.
