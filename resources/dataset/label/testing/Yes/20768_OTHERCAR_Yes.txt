            I've had my 1990 Honda CRX Si for about eleven months now. It currently has well over three hundred and thirty thousand miles on it. It runs like a champion. It is black and has tilt steering, rear defrost, air conditioning and a stereo cassette. I've only had to put a timing belt on it in the fifteen thousand miles I've put on it. I love the way it handles. It sit pretty low to the ground which makes it difficult at times to get into and out of, especially if your tall. Since it is a two seater, I wouldn't recommend it for people with kids or pets. It does have plenty of room in the hatch for groceries, and is very economical.<br><br>
