            I traded a 97 Honda Civic HX for the 2000 Dodge Intrepid ES.
Great decision. The Honda is a good car but they are too small. The Accord was first on my "must see" list, however, the sticker shock was too much. In reality it is a four passenger car. Fully equipped they outprice the loaded ES by a few thousand dollars. The Accord doesn't have the sporty appearance or the power of the Intrepid. 
My Intrepid seats five comfortably. I was also impressed with it's handling in bad weather. The acceleration is more than adequate and gas mileage is good. The controls and interior are updated nicely. everything is a handreach away. The autostick is a joy to use for those of us wanting to shift. It's great for passing on country roads.
I have had my Intrepid for 14 months now-I have two cons. The center console was loose-the dealer fixed immediatly. The other con is the back of the car. Takes a little practice with backing up. The back window is hard to see out of.
