            I own a 1991 Ford Taurus. Its has about 150K miles on it and it still runs like a pro. This particular car used to be an undercover police car and still contains the police radio. It has a 3.8 liter fuel injected engine and belive me it will fly. I really like how big and roomy the interior is . The only problems I have had so far with this car is the cv-joints. I had to replace both of them. It is a very comfortable car to drive. I recommend this car to anyone who likes to drive and plans to take long trips. <br><br>
