            2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse

Does the new Eclipse V6 manage to win my heart, replacing the previous generation Eclipse GST as one of the most fun-to-drive cars money can buy? In a word, no. Is this all-new car still the affordable all-star hatchback it used to be? Well, sort of. Lets find out what makes this thing tickï¿½

To some extent, many of the good things about the previous Eclipse are still there, hiding beneath the new sci-fi (&quot;Geomechanical&quot; according to Mitsubishi) bodywork. However, the Eclipse has definitely matured into a more refined automobile on almost all measurable wavelengths. Undoubtedly the big question on Mitsubishi's mind is, <i>will the newly redesigned Eclipse manage to eclipse its many competitors?</i> That remains to be seen, as it is still too early in the fight to determine who will be the ultimate victor.

If the initial reactions of the motoring public are any indication at all, this battle could get pretty ugly. The Eclipse's primary competitors in this exciting market segment are the Celica GT-S, Honda Accord V6 Coupe, and the aging Acura Integra GSR (the limited production Integra Type-R is not really a viable competitor, due to its limited production and bare-bones nature). Peripheral competitors are the Pontiac Firebird/Chevrolet Camaro, Mercury Cougar, Honda Prelude, Toyota Camry Solara, Ford Mustang, Chrysler Sebring/Dodge Avenger, etc.

Visually, the most striking features of the new Eclipse are the wavy grooves (call them &quot;ribs&quot;) in both doors. These horizontal character lines diminish in depth from the front of the doors towards the back, and serve absolutely no function whatsoever. However, they certainly do add to the Eclipse's futuristic, sporty appearance. Their overall effect is one of motion, even when the Eclipse is standing still. Some people have stated that they find these &quot;ribs&quot; to resemble something Pontiac might have done. Yes, I can see how this statement makes sense, but this car definitely does not look like a Pontiac. In my opinion, the ribs are needed to spice up the otherwise bland appearance of the new Eclipse, and they are executed stylishly and tastefully. In other words, I like 'em. :-)

This car definitely looks more mature (i.e. less playful) than it's predecessor. The large, pulled-back headlamp clusters are very prominent, and the equilaterally curved nose gives the car a purposeful, hard-edged stance, while still managing to remain classy and substantial. You notice these headlamps, whereas those on the last Eclipse were lost amidst the various gaping jowls of the front intake. Gone is the trademark bulge in the hood, as is the much-loved (optional) turbocharger of the previous Eclipse. The smooth, rounded hood makes the Eclipse seem like a larger car than it really is. With the hood bulge deleted, the front of the Eclipse finally looks symmetrical, for the first time ever.

This new Eclipse is seen by Mitsubishi as the replacement for <i>both</i> the previous Eclipse and the larger 3000GT, which finally goes out of production this year. By making a V6 an option, the new Eclipse tries to fill the shoes of the 3000GT. Does it succeed? Not quite. The 3000GT is a larger, more powerful, and more sophisticated car. The new Eclipse has grown a little, and it definitely is a nicer, more refined car than it has ever been, but make no mistake - it is <i>not</i> an effective replacement for the 3000GT. However, it will probably sell much better than the 3000GT ever did, thanks to far more competitive pricing.

But is it a proper replacement for the previous Eclipse? In terms of the vehicle's overall packaging, I would have to say that it probably is, but it has lost the spark which made the Eclipse a runaway success with the import racing scene. That spark is the much-loved (and often modified) optional turbocharged engine. This wonderful powerplant has a huge following of hardcore enthusiasts, many of whom have pumped its output into the realm of truly staggering horsepower figures.

Surprisingly, in the last few years of its life, the turbo Eclipse was a slow-seller for Mitsubishi, with less than 15% of all Eclipses sold being so equipped. It is for this reason, and also in an attempt to replace the 3000GT with a single car, that the top of the line Eclipse now sports a V6 instead. Many people have grumbled and growled about this move away from a turbocharger, but in reality this engine should prove to be both more reliable and a stronger seller then the old turbocharged inline-4.

Back to the styling thing for a moment; a subject of much controversy. The arcing roofline gives the impression of a fairly compact cabin, while at the same time the slab-sided styling and pronounced wheel arches make the car look larger. To my eye, the car looks slightly out of balance, but by no means unattractive. I particularly like the stylized wheel arches and the rear end, although I must admit that the nose is definitely lacking <i>something</i> (perhaps that bulge in the hood wasn't so bad after all?). I suspect some type of induction or power bulge (think Pontiac Firebird or Mercedes-Benz SLK) in the hood would spice things up quite nicely.

The exterior design is definitely one of those &quot;either you love it or you hate it&quot; things, and I would have to say that I am still undecided at this point -although it is growing on me, to be honest. You will have to decide for yourself if it works for you. One thing for certain, this car definitely turns heads -at least for now. It remains to be seen just how well this design will stand the test of time. I imagine people will grow tired of it rather quickly, as is typical of quirky designs in general.

Inside everything has changed. Joining the bulge in the hood in its absence is the traditional fighter-jet style, wraparound cockpit. I was actually very fond of the way the dash used to give the impression that you were behind the wheel of a very serious driving machine. The new dash is very nice (it follows the symmetrical theme of the exterior), but it somehow lacks the serious, <i>&quot;this car means business&quot;</i> feel of the one it replaces.

The interior reminds me of the new Mercury Cougar for some reason (perhaps the finish used on various plastics is similar), but the plastics and other materials are obviously of higher quality than those on the Mercury (although they are still not on par with the plastics used by the other Japanese manufacturers).

One area in which the Eclipse is definitely improved is the feeling of spaciousness inside the car. While not actually much larger than before, the car does feel bigger, both in the way it drives and in terms of interior space. The back seats are still pretty much a joke (they are probably only there to keep insurance rates down), but there does seem to be just a bit more room everywhere than owners of previous Eclipses are used to. The cargo area is still capable of swallowing decent amounts of stuff -a definite plus when compared with some other cars in this class such as the GM Firebird/Camaro twins.

Another area which has seen major improvement is outward visibility. While the previous Eclipse was aptly described as semi-claustrophobic, the view from the drivers seat of the new car is much better. However, the optional rear spoiler does impede rearward vision somewhat, as it neatly bisects the view out the rear window. It's a good thing visibility is improved, because the rounded design of the nose and the tall rear deck mean you have absolutely no idea where the outer corners of the car are at any given time.

Now for the really big news: the V6 engine. Replacing the turbocharged inline-four, this powerplant offers something the old top-line engine did not: refinement. While definitely a blast to drive, the old car seemed like more of a wild animal thrashing about on the end of its leash than a serious sports car, although it was certainly fast and fun. A definite change from the previous top of the line models, you are rewarded with the smooth, linear thrust of a hearty V6 when you floor the go-pedal. I personally happened to be a fan of the old turbo engine, but I must admit that there is really nothing like a strong V6.

The problem is that while certainly adequate, the V6 is simply not powerful <i>enough</i>. The new Eclipse is more than half a second slower to 60 mph than the previous, turbocharged car. This is not due to a power deficiency in the engine itself (it is rated at 205hp at the flywheel), but rather to the increase in weight, thanks to the use of a heavier engine and other changes in the car itself.

This new Eclipse is not underpowered by any means, but it is definitely not as much fun to drive as the last one was. The wild animal feel is gone, only to be replaced by the smooth revving, but definitely peaky nature of the V6. This engine reaches it's power peak at relatively high rpm (5,500), so you will have to get deep into the throttle to bring out what performance there is to be had from this car.

Unfortunately, when you do mash the pedal to the metal, you are not rewarded for your efforts with either blistering acceleration or a throaty exhaust note. Sure, the car is quick, but &quot;fast&quot; is not a term that easily comes to mind (unlike with the previous Eclipse turbo). The car feels bigger and heavier, but definitely more stable and well-planted. The exhaust should have been (IMHO) tuned for a much more aggressive note than it is. The engine sounds strangled by the restrictive setup employed by the factory. I imagine aftermarket exhausts will be a hot item for the new V6 Eclipse.

One area where there is a definite improvement over the previous Eclipse is in the handling department. The old car felt light on it's feet and did not like cornering much at moderate speeds. Fast corners were best left to truly skilled (i.e. professionally trained) drivers. The new car feels much more intuitive and responsive on the road. You have no question what the tires are doing, and feedback from the road is loud and clear at all times (although the new car also -thankfully-- leaves some of the harshness out of the suspension equation). At least Mitsubishi finally got the suspension part right. :-)

Living with this car on a day-to-day basis should prove to be both easy and enjoyable, due to it's greatly improved road manners and interior comfort. The optional in-dash, 4-disc CD changer is a nice toy, but the stereo itself is laid out rather oddly. The controls for the stereo are positioned low in the dash, and the display that indicates what station you are listening to is in a pod way up high in the top of the dash. This just feels weird, but I suppose one would get used to it after a while.

An odd decision on the part of Mitsubishi is the exclusion of ABS on all but the GT trim level. I find this both foolish and unsafe, as I am a major proponent of ABS being standard equipment on <i>every</i> car built.

Overall, I would have to say that the Eclipse is a nice package, but it is really more of a competitor to the Accord V6, and Toyota Camry Solara then to other more serious sports cars. Of course, this could all change if Mitsubishi does go ahead with the rumored installation of a supercharger (or possibly another turbo?) on an upscale (read: more $$$) V6 model. If they do so, expect this to raise the price of the car to the range of the also all-new Acura CL, a much nicer automobile, IMHO.

Since most people will opt for the automatic (less than 15% of all cars sold in the US last year were equipped with manual transmissions), I drove a V6 Eclipse equipped with the optional &quot;manumatic&quot; style shifter. These things are totally cool, and allow you to pretend that you are driving a stickshift without the use of a traditional clutch. I enjoyed driving it, and I recommend this option for anyone except those who love using a clutch in the traditional fashion. The unit works well, and certainly injects a measure of fun into the car that is absent when the transmission is left in fully automatic mode.

All in all, I liked the overall package the Eclipse represents, but I missed the <i>&quot;hold-on-here-we-go!&quot;</i> acceleration of the previous model. The old Turbo Eclipse was like a ride at an amusement park -fun, loud, entertaining, and definitely rough around the edges. The new V6 Eclipse is more like a train ride instead, offering better sound insulation, more comfort, and less of the visceral thrill factor for which the Eclipse Turbo was known.

Yes folks, the Eclipse has grown up a bit, and in doing so it has lost some of that which set it apart: the adrenaline rush. Think of the new Eclipse as the evolution of a rowdy teenager into a young adult. Still not completely responsible, but definitely more toned down and far less rash.

The reliability of Eclipses (and Mitsubishi products in general) has never really been on par with that of their other Japanese competitors. Previous Eclipses were a hit-or-miss thing: either you got a good one, or you didn't. I actually expect the new Eclipse to fair better than previous generations, for the simple reason that Mitsubishi products have been steadily improving in this regard over the past decade or so.

I gave this car three stars, due to a number of factors: It is a decent value, offering quite a bit for your money (V6 Eclipses can be had for anywhere between $21,000 and $26,000, depending on how you equip the car). Its reliability is unproven and therefore questionable, if previous Mitsubishi products are any indication. Its performance is somewhere north of luke-warm, but definitely not as downright exciting the way the old car was, and the styling is a little too weird for many consumers. A decent showing for Mitsubishi, but I would personally rather have a Prelude any day of the week. :-)

Ratings scale: 1-10 (1 being worst, 10 being best)
