            I bought my Integra new in June of 1996.  I was essentially &quot;moving up&quot; from a Honda Civic - 1991.  I comparison shopped with other cars in the same class and found that as a package, there is NO comparison.  For the combination of performance, reliability and aesthetics, I found nothing in the class that is better.

Positives:
- VERY reliable.  I have 60,000 miles (100,000 km) on the car and have done nothing but change the oil.
- Quick.  While overall I think the car could have more guts, the manual transmission allows for pretty good acceleration
- Comfortable.  The leather package in the SE is really nice.  The front seats are deep buckets and really feel like you are sitting in them instead of on them.
- Great resale value.  After 3 and a half years, I can still get 60% of what I paid for the car.

Negatives:
- Where is the 6 cylinder option?
- Typical Honda sound system - it sucks.
- The 140hp to the all-seasons is bad in the snow.  I fixed it with good snows, but without, the traction isn't great.
- If you have anyone over 5' tall in the back seat, they will hit their head on the glass.

Hope this helps you.<br><br>
