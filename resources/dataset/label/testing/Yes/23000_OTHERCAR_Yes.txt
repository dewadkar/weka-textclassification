            The Polaroid 640 digital camera is highly comparable to other brands. Both in quality, resolution, and price range. As with most digital cameras in the $299 price range the results are good.

Resolution is the biggest factor in photo quality. The higher the resolution the better quality picture. However, as resolution increases, so does cost. If your going to use a digital camera for photo's of a new born to send via e-mail or place on the web site. The $299 priced digital camera will be fine with its 640 x 480 resolution. Comes standard with a 2 MB flash card that holds 36 full 640 x 480 resolution pictures and 96 low 320 x 240 resolution  pictures. Batteries are included with your purchase. No need to make a separate purchase. But you may want to pick up extra batteries to have on hand. The included AC power source should be used when displaying your images on TV or uploading to your PC. Save your batteries for taking pics.

The Polaroid 640 digital camera is easy to setup on the computer. The upload procedure is simple and straightforward. Just slide the 2 MB smart flash card into the floppy adopter unit and retrieve your photos as you would any file from a floppy drive. Not only does this aid tremendously in user ability as it frees up a serial port. Thus reduces the technical complications for the first time user. The camera itself is attractive, appears to be durable, and is simple to use. It's light weight and fits in most shirt or jacket pockets. The number of photos the camera can hold at any one time can be easily increased with a separate purchase of smart flash cards (smart memory flash cards can be bought in 2 MB, 4 MB,... 16 MB ... up to 128 MB sizes). The software for this camera requires a minimum of 70 MB of hard drive space for installation.

Don't have a computer. Don't fret! you can attach the digital camera to your TV set and display the photos. Turn on you VCR and record them to VHS tape. A great way to share those precious moments with family and friends. Don't have and interest in buying a PC but would like to print your photos from the camera. You can do that also - just drop by your favorite electronics store and look for a color print that uses the Smart Flash Cards. 

I would recommend a Polaroid 640 digital camera to a first time buyer, novice photographer, or that student headed off for college. It's a great way to introduce yourself or a child to photography. Without the expense of film and photo developing.

Prices are starting to drop daily making digital cameras more affordable. Polaroid 640 digital camera would make a nice first purchase.
