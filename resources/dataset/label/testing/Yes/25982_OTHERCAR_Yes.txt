            This will be the second Cavalier that I have owned.  The first lasted 12 years and I expect the same reliability and quantity of service from this car.

I purchased the LS model with the larger 2.4L engine.  That made all the difference in the world on power, responsiveness, and enjoyment while driving.  The LS model also has the larger 15&quot; wheels that provide a much smoother ride on all surfaces.

The interior is very nice for this class of car and compares very well with all of the other cars I looked into before selecting the Cavalier (Ford Probe, Dodge Neon, Hyundai Accent and Elantra, Mercury Mystic and others I can't remember).  The radio/CD/Cassette player is relly fun.  Each person's personal preferences are saved as well as their last radio station or track on the current CD and are activated when using the remote on each person's key chain.

Heating and cooling are very efficient and are more than adequate on either temperature extreme.

If I have to list any negatives about the car they would be the below-par gas mileage on non-freeway roads (24 MPG) and the large difference in heights of the gas and brake pedals.

I would definately recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
