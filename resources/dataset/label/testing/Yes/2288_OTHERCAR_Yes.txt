            While sitting in the midst of oncoming traffic, I exhausted my right foot on the gas pedal, trying to get my 1979 ford Fairmont started after it had stalled. You now what, I thought aloud, this hunk-a-junk isn't worth my time. It was as if the magical Kia fairy had danced onto my withering dashboard. After a few minor calculations, really, it was a no-brainer, it was time to buy a brand new car and stop hasseling with used ones. And the Kia Sephia is the way to go.If you're thinking of buying a new car and don't have enough money for a BMW or Jag, go with the Sephia. For less than, much less than 200 bucks a month, the Sephia can be yours. Alrite, I know you're probably thinking that I work for KIA and will get a huge bonus for everyone that reads this, but sorry bucko, this is for real, an actual testimony ( I really should be on a commercial).I bought a Sephia in September of 99 and have put on 14,000 miles since (as of mid-April). I have had not one problem. In fact, my Sephia seems to be running even better now than when I bought it. Oh, so you want the facts, the real deal, the bottom line, if you will. O.K. here are the pros a.k.a. the benefits of the Sephia:  great gas mileage (28 mpg city/32 highway), sleek appearance, a/c (optional), metallic color, easy to handle, crisp stereo sound, quiet engine, smooth ride. Cons or negatives: the acceleration is average (it is difficult to pickup speed), some of the accessories are not too sturdy (for example, a knob on my arm rest in the console already broke), windows fog up when it rains (but that is typical for compact vehicles).So there you have it. If you're teetering on whether to buy a used car, it's better to invest your money into a KIA Sephia.<br><br>
