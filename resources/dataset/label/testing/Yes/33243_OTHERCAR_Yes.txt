            The E-10 is my third digital camera and far and away the best. OK, the others--both Kodaks--were not nearly as pricey, but the E-10 is not only superior in every way, it is, dollar-for-dollar, the clear bargain leader.

My film cameras of choice have long been OM-1, Om-2, and OM-4 from Olympus, although I have used Canons and Nikons on occasion.

Before taking the plunge, I did a great deal of research, including field-testing, before deciding on this Olympus, however. The sheer bulk of the camera put me off at first. One of the things I loved about the OM- line was the small size and light weight. After using the E-10 for a while, though, those objections disappeared. It is an ergonomic masterpiece! I found it natural and comfortable to carry it by my side securely and naturally balanced by three fingers cradling the grip. After a bit of attention to the layout of the dials and buttons (Yes, I had to read the manual!) I found them very easy to manipulate and was able to make adjustments on the fly in a very short time.
In short, if there is a more ergonomically friendly camera, I haven't found it.

Picture quality is excellent. I am mostly interested in printing fairly large format prints and find the camera really delivers. Of course it has a non-interchangeable lens--big deal! The 4X zoom in this big piece of glass is certainly ample, and the 1/640 top speed is also within a wide usability range. The 4 megapixel capability delivers big image size when you need it. If those specs aren't adequate, you're doing some specialized work and can prepare to spend several times what this baby costs. Likewise, battery life is perfectly acceptable, especially using NiMH rechargeables and carrying some spares--never a problem for me.

I also appreciate 1.) easy exposure mode selection and setting, 2.) manual zoom rind, 3.) hot shoe (Accepts the auxiliary flash I had for my OM-4.), 4.) ability to use either SmartMedia or CompactFlash card and to quickly alternate between them, and 5.) barely perceptible shutter lag (and the crisp quiet little sound that can be programmed).

Am I happy with the E-10? You bet. I'm thinking about getting another one.
