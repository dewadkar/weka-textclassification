            I am looking into purchasing a 2000 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS, and have been doing an extensive amount of research on them recently.  I have found that this little car has been getting rave reviews from people all over.  The Subaru Impreza 2.5RS is modeled after the 300hp World Champion Rally car.  Of course the factory version of this car only pushes out 165hp, but it has an incredible potential for many horsepower increasing upgrades such as turbos, superchargers, computer chips, air intakes, and many others to bump up the horsepower to obtain about 250hp easily and even 300 if you really put a lot into it.  I have scoped this car out time and time again, and I am still in love with its looks interior and exterior.

The sleek design of the body of this car is like no other car on the road today.  All of the other car companys have gone for the Euro-Race car look with the Acura Integras, and Honda preludes and civics.  This is the first car that i have seen push into the rally car look of race cars.  The 2.5RS comes standard with the hood scoop as well as the hood vents and the enormous smooth looking fog lights on the front air-dam.  The spoiler in the rear has a brake light in the middle and looks incredibly well crafted not to mention that its really snug and doesnt shake around like the spoilers on ford escorts.  The car comes with 16 in rims and 55 profile tires, which is really rare to come from the factory like this.

The interior of the Impreza 2.5RS is simple and very well layed out.  I personally cannot stand it when there is a bunch of extra little buttons and knobs that serve no purpose.  It just makes the car look cluttered like a messy dorm room.  The White-backed gauges are a good accent to the all black interior.  The shift knob is covered in black leather and compliments the stearing wheel rather well.  The front seats were very well formed and there was plenty of headroom even for a 6'1&quot; person like myself.  The back seats looked like they could fit 2 people comfortably, and 3 with some discomfort.  All of the controls are easy to reach, and simple to use so you dont ever have to take your eyes off the road for long to change the heat or whatever you may want to do.

However, I am almost positive, that the All wheel drive and 4wheel disc w/ABS, and the performance features of the car are probably the best features on the car.  Although I have not test driven one (Colorado Law says you have to be 21, how lame is that?!!!!), I have read reviews from others who have, and they say it handles like a charm.  Well it better, its a rally car, its designed for traction on all road conditions!!!

All in all, this car is a great deal for only 19,000 brand new with 0 miles.  I am currently trying to work out my financial situations so i can afford one soon here.<br><br>
