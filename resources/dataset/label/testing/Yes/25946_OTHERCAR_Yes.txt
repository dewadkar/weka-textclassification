            The Pontiac Grand Am is one of the most reliable cars I have ever owned.  It gets great gas mileage and also it starts up every morning.  It doesn't have the most power in its class, but for a 2.0 liter it sure does get going in a hurry.  As you have already read, my firebird was a pretty fast car.  It had some major pick-up.  This car isn't quite as fast as the firebird, but if you were to race the two cars, I bet you the Grand Am would stay right up there with the firebird.  One of the great features on the Pontiac Grand Am is the Stereo controls on the Steering wheel, so when you are driving you don't have to take your eyes off the road to change the station.<br><br>
