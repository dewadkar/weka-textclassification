            I own a 1994 Chevrolet Blazer S-10.  I purchased the vehicle new and I can honestly say  it is absolutely the greatest vehicle I have ever own.  I have never experience any real major problems, with it, since I purchased the car.  It presently has over 143,000 miles, on it, and it still runs like a dream.  What I like best about my blazer is its smooth ride and easy handling.  The interior is roomy and is just right for hauling kids and pets around.  I have only had one mechanical problem, with the truck , that being the fuel pump going out.  I have followed the suggested routine maintenance schedule and will continue to do so and hopefully the truck will last another 143,000 miles.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone  looking for qualities of a truck and the ride of a car.<br><br>
