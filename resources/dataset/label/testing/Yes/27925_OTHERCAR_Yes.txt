            I have owned the Lexus GS400 Black/ Black, 17&quot; sport wheels for a bit under 2 years now.  There is not a day that goes by that I have regretted the choice, much less look forward to getting in this machine and flying.  I did a significant amount of test driving and research prior to making my decision.  In the end it came down to the BMW 540ia and the Lexus GS400.  In the end, I chose the GS over the BMW for the following reasons:

1. Quicker.  The GS feels and is a faster car, even over the BMW 540i Sport.  To get the most out of the BMW 6 speed, you really have to know how to row, and there are VERY few who are adept at the techniques that the drivers in the test magazines use.   The GS is scary fast, and handles extremely well.  I have routinely beaten 540's off the line to 60 on the street.  The only gripe with the GS is that the driver feedback is slightly muted, both in exhaust note and handling.  Still this car can not be out maneuvered by the BMW with even a good driver, especially using the E-Shift.  There are now reasonable aftermarket suspension and exhaust upgrades that are available and Lexus is introducing a sport version in 2001 if you really need this. 

2. Refinement.  The GS is a unbelievably well thought out and refined vehicle.  The BMW by comparison seems rough on the edges. Further, the interior of the GS blows the BMW away both in terms of layout and quality. The BMW feels antiquated and cheap by comparison.  The BMW sound system, even the premium is a joke for a car in this price range.  The leather in the BMW feels like vinyl.  The Lexus leather is super high quality and the stereo is killer.  

3. Reliability.  Check the reports or go to www.bimmer.org and check out the tweeky problems with the BMW's.  Typically nothing major, but the BMWs seem to suffer from more annoying problems over time.  My GS has been flawless save for a slightly warped front rotor at 20,000 miles.

4. Dealer.  The treatment you get a Lexus is royal.  The treatment you get at BMW is a notch or two below.  Further, the price negotiation experience at Lexus was reasonable and respectful.  BMW, arrogance (2 different dealers).

5. Price.  You can negotiate under sticker for the GS. Very hard to do with a BMW 540.  All I could get the BMW dealers to do was to throw in a CD changer (quoted at $900 ?).  They just stated that if you do not want it, someone else will walk in tomorrow who will by it for sticker.  In the end, the difference in price between my loaded GS400 and the 540i auto with sport package was $6.5K ! 

In the end, many prefer the BMW, but don't be misled by the BMW &quot;aura&quot;.  There are many who will buy a BMW just for the status / mystique. Don't let this sway you too much, take a serious look a the Lexus from all angles. I was dead set on buying the BMW, but in the end, it was an easy choice.
