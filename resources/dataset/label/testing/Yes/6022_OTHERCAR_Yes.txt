            Those of you who have not test driven a 1995 A90 S, please do! Looking for quality, comfort, and style without paying over $30K? Try finding one of these gems for under $10K!! 

I am here to encourage you to get inside of one, take a look around and see the comfort and quality, then hit the roads! Great in city and even better on the highway. The automatic transmission is smooth, and the passing power is wonderful. This car turns heads and then will leave them in the dust!

Far from anything generic, these Audis will make you feel special, especially as you cruise along next to all the fat cow SUVs, or blow by the weaker engined compact Japanese cars. 

With a little imagination you might think yourself 007, and wonder where the switch for the smoke screen is, or the oil slick! You might even wonder when the waiter will arrive with your meal -- the seats are so comfortable, and the cabin so quiet! Your wife, or dates, or friends, will be impressed with your choice, guaranteed.

If you are a person of sport with a taste for quality, get yourself into one of these creations and welcome yourself to the smartest 'cool club' around.
