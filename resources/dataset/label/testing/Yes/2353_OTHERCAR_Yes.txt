            The Toshiba PDR-M4 is probably one of the best digital cameras that you can get for your money.  At an estimated price of $425 and with 1.9 megapixels this camera is great.  It has a built in zoom, serial and usb connections to your computer, a video imput and a DC in 5V outlet.  Set up is really easy with this camera.  You just move the switch over to set-up and an easy to use options screen.  It shows up on the 1 and 3/4 inch screen which is a really good size screen for a digital camera.  This camera is basically for anybody.  You can use it if you have never used a camera before and if you are a pro.  Getting your pictures on your camera is also really easy.  All you have to do is connect the cord from your computer to your camera and move the switch over to the connect option and your computer will automaticaly open the software and promt you if you want to move all of your images to your computer.  Quality is also excellent.  Even on the worst option the pictures are better than your average 35mm film.  I would have to say this is a really good buy for a digital camera.  I have seen some cheaper ones for like $150 but the photos look like trash and I have seen more expensive ones that all you are paying for is the internal flash and maybe a little better zoom.  But this camera is good for the average Joe that wants to take good pictures and not spend like $800 plus on a camera.<br><br>
