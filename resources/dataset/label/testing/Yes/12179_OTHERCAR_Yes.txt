            OK, i have had 5 Grand Cherokeess since 93, and was looking for a change. The Wrangler always seemed a bit crude for me, but with the changes in 97 it has become much more mainstream.  I guess all I needed was a dashboard instead of steel plate with a speedometer.  

Before getting to the details, let me say, there will be a Wrangler in my driveway from now on. This car(SUV?), despite any of its small shortcomings, is a blast to have. It brings the kid out in everyone who gets in it and has this uncanny ability to call out to you, saying "Lets Play!!!". I have taken my kids out of school on the first nice day and brought them to the beach. I've taken days off from work because the Wrangler puts a whole new twist to Spring fever. Its not for everyone, but if you want to have a good time and don't care about luxury, this is the way to go. 

The first thing that surprised me was the cost of the Wrangler compared to the Grand Cherokee, once I added all the stuff I wanted, I had pretty much a Wrangler Sport dressed to a  Sahara without the funky colored seats and matching fenders. It came out to $27,600 sticker. For another 3K I could be in a cushy GC Laredo. Leasing was also out of the question. The lease price was $120 more a month than a Grand Cherokee and the incentives "do not apply" to the wrangler(So I was told). The car is marketed to be purchased. My actual purchase price was a little over 25K. I added the 6 cyl, Auto trans, A/C, Cruise, Dual tops, ABS and the Canyon wheel group.

Next: The Wrangler is about as aerodynamic as a cinder block, so the gas mileage is pathetic. I get 13-15mpg combined driving.  Overall though, onroad manners are pretty good. Not much different from the bigger SUV's but slightly stiffer and more touchy. Ride & Handling is a bit of an adventure at speeds above 70. Its not very forgiving to minor movement on the wheel.  Also, if you plan on taking high speed turns, buy a Corvette, not a Wrangler. Treat it with respect and its no different than any SUV. Take 50MPH tight turns and you'll loose your lunch when it lands back on its wheels after the second roll. contrary to what has been said, you have to TRY to roll it. Its not going to roll on its own, especially if your driving responsibly. The stiffer onroad ride however is what makes ride & handling offroad like a mountain goat in its element. It doesn't bounce around anywhere near as much as my Grand cherokee. Even my off road passengers were surprised at the ride. Side by side, The offroad prowess is superior to the Grand Cherokee with its big V8 and Quadradrive. The Wranglers small size makes it easier to handle and the GC had trouble keeping up without bottoming out.

FYI, NTHSB Safety tests rated this vehicle 4 stars in front end collisions 3 stars in rollover resistance.    

To comment on aerodynamics/wind noise: in my opinion it's not bad at all. I've seen alot of reviews complaining about wind noise, but I don't have any issues with it at all.  Its better with the hard top than the soft top, but neither is bad enough to complain about. The soft top does do some funky things at high speeds with crosswinds. But then again, so does the rest of the Wrangler. Crosswinds are not friendly to a car shaped like a cigar box. 

Still..... There is nothing here that would make me give up my new Wrangler. 

The only downside I have: The storage space here is dismal. Theres a cavernous center console where Jimmy Hoffa can be hiding and a decent glove box. The "trunk" behind the rear seat is enough for a small cooler and hibachi, or 2-3 bags of groceries. If your looking to use the wrangler as your family car or primary vehicle, be aware, you cant live out of this car. If you remove the rear seat, leave the kids & wife home and just take your dog, your fine. Without the seat, the back is then a decent cargo area for gear & beer. This space limitation is my only issue. We take both cars to the beach. The Grand Cherokee has the wife, cooler, barbque, food, toys, etc..... I have the wrangler, 2 kids and the dogs. At that point I have to squeeze in the towel and sunscreen. 

Power with the Inline 6 is good. It gets up to highway plus speeds with little effort. Acceleration off the line however needs something to be desired, probably due to gearing and the 3 speed auto tranny. Its' got low end torque, not speed. A 4th gear overdrive would be nice for the highway but not available. The "Select trac" transfer case would also be nice so we can stay in full time 4WD, but oh well, not available. I tried the 4 cyl, manual tranny also. Stay away. Horribly underpowered. 

Interior comfort is surprisingly good. I'm 6'1" 220Lbs. It would be nice if the seats went back a little further, to extend the arms a little more, but this can be cheated by reclining the seat slightly. Front seat leg room is ample and I can stretch out easily. Side to side, elbow room is a little tight but you get used to it. This can be a good thing though, being there are no power windows,its easier to reach the passenger window crank, which would not be to easy in a Navigator(do they make those without power windows?). 

FYI, After market power door locks are available. It cost me $150.00 total and hooked them up to my alarm system(Viper) and remote. They lock/unlock with the remote and lock automatically when I start the car.  Power window kits are also available, but thats really pushing the heritage of the Wrangler.    

Front seats are very comfortable, even for long trips. Rear seat leg room is, according to my kids, believe it or not, better than in the Grand Cherokee. i think the rear seat is a little tiny for adults, and have a low back. Kids dont mind it. Because of the rear area being all glass & windows, its gives an illusion and feels big & roomy. Rear elbow room is ample because there are no sidewalls, the armrest in the rear is the wheelwell. 

Bottom line. The wrangler is Not A PRIMARY VEHICLE, family car or a "soccer moms" minivan. Buy it for what it is. A BIG KIDS TOY!!! Its comfortable, Fun, with Minimal frills. It has its own voice that calls out for its owner to stay home and have a good time with familiy, friends and the sun/sand/mud. I drove it down to the beach and drove thru the waves(yes I pressure washed everything when i got home), a few days before it was up to its doors in Mud and flying over moguls, climbing logs and wading thru a stream. The next day it was washed to its shiny Flame Red self and took me to work at my deskjob... CD playing, top off, and waited patiently for me to get out.  My kids are having the time of their life with it and so am I.... even though my boss is upset because I have spring fever and having the wrangler doesn't help. I'm 41, a professional, with a wife & 2 kids, so you don't have to be a college kid or surfer dude to love it. From this point on.....I'll have one forever.... 
So..... 

Go for it!!!!  Stay young..... and enjoy!!!!!!
