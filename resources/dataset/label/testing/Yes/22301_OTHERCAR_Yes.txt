            After looking around at all of the different options (SUV, wagons, vans)
the MPV came out on top.  We were looking for a car that could haul 
cargo as well as people.  Having had a Dodge Caravan, where taking out
the seats required a major effort, being able to fold down the rear
seat in the MPV made the difference to me.  The middle seats can 
also be removed very simply to turn this van into a real cargo hauler.

While I love this van for its looks, handling and versatility the only
downside is the way Mazda packages this car.  It is very hard to locate
one without a lot of options added on.  The option packages that Mazda
offers are expensive for what they are.   <br><br>
