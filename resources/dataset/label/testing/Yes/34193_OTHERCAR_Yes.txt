            The 2000 Passat has something going for it that not many wagons out there do: it drives more like a coupe than a wagon.  When I first drove the Passat, I was taking a friend who had lost his license, due to excessive points, to a point-reduction class.  The Passat did very well driving on some of the worst roads in Brooklyn and Queens in New York City.  The ultra-tight suspension kept us from bottoming out on huge potholes which, always threatened to break the oil pan on my old camry.  This tight suspension and overall road hugging capabilities allowed me to dart through traffic with ease.  The powerful brakes make stopping short at moderate speeds possible.  

Perhaps the best feature however is the acceleration.  I've actually gotten this wagon to peel out at red lights, and that's when using the automatic mode, from a dry start.  It's V6 is much beefier than the engines that come standard on the Outback, and Camry models I compared it to.  The Passat can cruise at high speeds, and does so at relatively low rpms on the highway.  I tested this when driving from Boston to Montreal one time.  It can handle 100 and not drop a gear in order to climb most hills.  I must admit though, that buying a performance intake will greatly improve this car's gas mileage, and highway top speeds.  I think that at higher rpms, it simply burns a richer mixture of gas and air than it should.  Any good intake system will clear this problem up.  

Unfortunately for passengers, this car is not very comfortable to ride in.  My cousins complain that the seats are too hard, and that you feel every single bump on the road.  Rather than be bothered though, I consider a little hardship to be worth enduring for the ability to fly over potholes without bottoming out.  

Another problem I've had with this car is that every single part costs a fortune to replace.  I actually had to pay $50 for the detachable radio antenna when it was stolen.  I hope I never have to repair any serous body damage, because I probably would lose my house if I had to.

Overall though, this car is probably one of the most fun station wagons out there to drive.  It seems to be targeted towards an audience who cares more for performance than for comfort.  Depending on what type of person you are and who you drive with, this could be a great buy.<br><br>
