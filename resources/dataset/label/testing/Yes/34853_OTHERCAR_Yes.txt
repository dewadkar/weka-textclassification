            I bought this van last month after my 1991 Saturn finally died.  I researched Consumer's Reports and the Honda Odyssey was top rated.  Being a mom of 2 small children, I was most interested in safety and ergonomics.

The Odyssey is the only van with 7 seats ALL with lap/shoulder belts.  It is the least expensive to insure of the following 3:

Toyota Sienna
Nissan Quest
Mazda MPV

It was even cheaper to insure than my old Saturn!

Ergonomics:

The Honda Odyssey has twin captains chairs in the center that can be MOVED together or apart, which is very convenient with arguing children.

The Nissan had a standard television placed between the driver and passenger seats, which made it impossible to get back to the kids during their many requests for assistance.  The Honda features a collapsible tray-table between the driver and passenger seats...very easy to move.


Driving is a great joy in this van.  It has tremendous power and just speeds along, even over mountain roads.  It does tend to get away from me sometimes, though.  I have to brake often.

The disappearing Magic Seat is incredible.  Get a demonstration of it.  We packed our 2 kids in the middle and a big Christmas tree in the back with tons of room to spare.

I hated buying the Van.  Nobody HAD one to sell me!  When I finally found one to buy, we got marked UP $2000.00 over MSRP , even after 5 hours of negotiation.  We got the Leather and at least got something for our additional money.  The leather is nice, but the fabric was really nice, too.

Overall, I am really happy with my purchase.  I feel the vehicle will hold it's value and keep running long after we have paid it off; which is more than I can  say for the others.
