            We ordered our 2001 Maxima in Sept 2000, before they appeared in the showrooms and took delivery a few weeks later. We now have almost 8000 miles on it, most city/parkway driving, only two long high speed  turnpike trips. We like the car.

1- Styling: Attractive. The rear looks truncated. But overall, trim and eager.

2- The interior is simple with a bit of wood-grain trim and brushed chrome accents, which gives it a classy look. Every bit as nice as its cousin the Infiniti.

3- The leather seats are comfortable, 8 way adjustable drivers seat is great. Both front seats are heated, and the heat levels individually adjustable .

4-Handling is precise and responsive.

5-Very rapid acceleration. Handy when  leaving an entry ramp onto a highway. You are at road speed in seconds.

6-Brakes a efficient and responsive. Have not had an emergency  braking occasion, so have had no experience with the ABS. Little snow and ice last winter also gave  little experience with the traction control system.

7-The sound system with speakers surrounding you, is excellent. It has AM/FM radio, tape and CD. However the redundant steering wheel controls
 are a pain. I find I am  changing channels  accidentally frequently.

8-The trunk is spacious, with adjustable  retainer netting.

9-Car came with optional sunroof,windbreaker, mudguards, mats, side  impact airbags, and traction control in addition to standard GLE equipment. We chose not to order the rear spoiler.


10 Fuel economy is not that great. We get 17mpg around town and about 22 on the open highway. The car is rated 19/26

11 We had one problem at 3000 miles. A defective oxygen sensor had to be replaced.
12 We paid $25,900.00  plus taxes and tags

13 This is now nearing the end of the 2001 model year. 

Economic conditions are quite different from last year at
 this time, the Yen is weaker and the Dollar stronger. It 
may be possible to get a very good deal this year on a 
leftover. I can recommend the car to anyone looking for 
luxury at an affordable price.
