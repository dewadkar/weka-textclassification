            This car offers all the amenities of a car that will cost you ten thousand dollars more. I personally own the jxi model of the sebring convertible, and I must say it has been very good to me. The leather is plush and the seats are comfortable. The power seats offer comfort to whoever is sitting in them. The infinity sound system including amp can put out impressive sound quality. Features also include remote keyless entry, cruise, power locks/windows, tilt, premium wheels, and power top. The car's styling speaks for itself(quite prominently), forcing people to stop and take notice. The small, but strong v-6 propels the car smoothly and powerfully.  The touring suspension provides for a very smooth and comfortable job, yet doesn't back down when you ask it to hug a tight corner. The best feature of this car may be the back seat and the trunk. Both of them are exceptionally large for a convertible. The people in the back seat enjoy all the comfort that the driver does. Not to mention the more than generous trunk, a rare find for a convertible. I recommend this car to anyone that loves to just go out on a sunday afternoon and drive.<br><br>
