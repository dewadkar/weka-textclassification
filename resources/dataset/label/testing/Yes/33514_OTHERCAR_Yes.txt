            I recently bought this car, September 02, and I have nothing but good things to say. The power is great thanks to its 3.5L V6, which produces an estimated 255hp. The horsepower is actually closer to 240, which is the same amount as the 3.5-liter Nissan Altima. I have tested the car&#146s speed and was able to get a 14.8 quarter mile run, as well as being able to reach speeds around 120 mph in only fourth gear.

There are plenty of options to choose from which can add quite a bit to the overall MSRP and drive the price considerably up. These can include: leather interior, navigation system, heated seats and mirrors, power memory seat location, and a BOSE stereo system. The navigation is a great add-on to any car but carries a hefty price tag of $2000. It is also a CD based system, which could involve the driver in constantly changing CD&#146s for different locations. I did however get the powered moonroof and the helical limited slip differential.

I found the car to be extremely roomy. I am about 6'3&#148 and with seat all the way back people can still seat in the seat directly behind me without any problems. The only problem with room is that the emergency brake handle is at an old angle and can be a discomfort when engaged. 

The 6 speed manual transmission is a very great feature to this car. It helps keep the gas mileage up for a 6 cylinder while giving the drive the ability to accelerate when needed. With the gas mileage I am currently getting about 25-27 miles per gallon with half city driving and half highway driving.

The only thing I do not like about the car is its handling. I found the suspension to be very soft and to not hold the road as well as it should. This can be solved with the introduction of a rear sway bar which will cost the user about $150-$200. The tires that come with the car are also a key disadvantage to its handling. With the addition of Z rated tires this car will be able to handle just as well as its smaller counterparts.

Also I found there is a small amount of wind noise coming from the car at higher speeds on highway driving. This can be solved by turning up the radio.

Overall I would highly recommend this car to the person who is looking for a mid sized car with the luxury items seen in higher classed models and still have the power to drive the car with passion.
