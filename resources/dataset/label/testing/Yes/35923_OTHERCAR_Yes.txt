            If you want one of the greatest handling, looking, and just pure sports car driving experience the Toyota MR2 Turbo is for you. Sadly the production of the MKII (second generation) MR2 was discontinued on our shores in 1995 however their are lots of used ones around. The MR2 Turbo comes stock with Toyota's best motor ever built the 3sgte. It's a four banger with enormous potential. From the factory it comes with 200 horsepower with 210 lbs of torque. The car is a mid-engine racebred high performance machine. There is not another car in the MR2's class that can compare to its handling, reliability, and aerodynamics. I purchased a 1991 MR2 a few months ago and it is by far the best car I could have ever bought for 8,000.00. When you drive the MR2 you can feel the road and hear the motor pushing you from right behind your seat. If you are into racing and want power and history at a reasonable price I would highly recommend a second generation Toyota MR2 Turbo.<br><br>
