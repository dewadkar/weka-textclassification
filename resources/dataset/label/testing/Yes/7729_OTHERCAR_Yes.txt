            I bought my 4 door Plymouth Neon in March of 1997 because I liked the look and basically needed a reliable, inexpensive car with great gas mileage for commuting 30+ miles each way to work.  My Neon has done that and much more!!

The Neon is easy to handle, has great pick up and has been trouble free since I purchased it.  The cab is extremely roomy for a car of it's size and the driver and passenger seats are very comfortable.  The back seat has ample leg and head room, but the seats are not quite as comfortable as the back.  The back seat has 60/40 split to the trunk, which makes it convenient for hauling larger objects (or for reaching into the trunk for something when you are too lazy to go around and open the trunk).  The gas mileage has been exceptional - and with regular routine maintenance, on the highway easily averaging 33-35+ miles per gallon.

In the summer of 98, my husband and I decided to test the Neon to the fullest.  We took sabbaticals from work and took the Neon on a cross-country camping, hiking and rock climbing tour.  Starting in Pennsylvania, through Colorado, Oregon, California into Canada and ending up in Arizona, we put a total of 11,000 miles on the car in 3 months time.  The car held up beautifully throughout this ordeal and was roomy enough to hold all of our gear for camping and rock climbing.  While it isn't recommended or suggested by any means, we even took the Neon on some easy grade off road treks to access camping and climbing areas and found it to handle well in those instances too.  And during the inevitable rain showers, the reclining seats in front proved to be comfortable for taking a short snooze.

The 5 speed Neon is a great vehicle for anyone looking for an extremely affordable and reliable car.  We are looking forward to enjoying it for many more years.<br><br>
