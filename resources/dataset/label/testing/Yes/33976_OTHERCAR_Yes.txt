            I bought this product for the same reason as everyone else- the price.  I saw a deal at XOOM.com for only $25 plus S&amp;H, a great deal anyway you look at it.  I was hoping I could use it for my auctions at Ebay.  I tried it out, and definitely it is a lot more convenient than a regular camera, taking the whole roll, getting it developed, scanning it in, all of that took an extraordinary amount of time. 

The digital Jam Cam, on the other hand couldn't be easier.  After a simple installation of the software, I was ready to go.  I started to take some pictures, some inside, some outside, experimenting with the amount of light and distance.   I found that the distance was very hard to judge at first and that my pictures were not always on target, but with some practice, I corrected this.  I found the overall picture quality to be acceptable, sometimes the pictures were a lot clearer than others, for whatever reason.

I did even manage to get a few pictures that were good enough quality to use on my auctions, but if you do that kind of stuff often, you would probably look at investing in a better camera.  I also used the camera to take pictures of my new baby to send to relatives by email, and that worked out really great, since the quality wasn't as important  as the general idea of how he was growing up.   I would have to say I definitely got a good value for the price I paid, after all, what can you expect for $25!  This would be wonderful for kids as a starter camera.<br><br>
