            The new 2000 Dodge Viper has to be the best one they've put out so far.  It has a brand new shape and is fully equipped with a lot of cool features.  I love the leather seats and the clean stylish look of the interior that goes with it.  The Viper has a very smooth ride.  And the best part about it is that it looks so pimp :)  You have to admit that you'd like to been seen driving this.  The only thing that bugs me about the new Vipers along with any of the old ones is that they only come in standard.  That kind of gets to me since I'm not too big on driving stick shift.  Automatic is what I'm used to.  However, if you like driving stick shift and you want a sleek sophisticated yet sporty looking car, the Dodge Viper is definitely the car for you.<br><br>
