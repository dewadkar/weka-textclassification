            I recently traded in my 10 year old Ford Probe for a 1997 Acura 2.5 TL.  WHAT A STEP UP!  It is an entry level car to the so-called luxury market.  I had to decide between a 3.2 and a 2.5 TL.  The 2.5 is actually a slant 5 cylinder while the 3.2 is a V6.  It is not quite as powerful (especially in pickup) as the 3.2, but it is plenty powerful enough.

Everything is top notch in the interior.  It has a power drivers seat, windows, locks, moon roof, and a heated drivers seat. Leather interior is very comfortable with an adjustable lumbar support that fits just right.  It is extremely quiet inside which makes the CD/AM-FM/Cassette system sound fantastic.  The climate control system works flawlessly as you can dial in the temperature of choice.  It will automatically kick in the air/heat as needed.  You can easily switch over to the manual controls also, if you want to start up the defrost for example.  The cruise control is easy to operate and the intermittent wipers are fine.  The only flaw (I think) is the built in antenna in the rear window.  It just doesn't seem to pull in the radio stations as strong as it could be.

As for the driving experience, you can quickly gain speed because it is so quiet and not know it.  So far, no ticket :).  The tires that came with it were 205/R60/15 which hold the road fantastically and are mounted on some sharp alloy rims.  The color silver is fairly common but looks great on the car.  Braking is adequate as it has 4 wheel anti-lock braking system.  I haven't had to put it to the test though yet.

What really sold me on the car, is that it still looks and smells brand new.  I've had many people in the car and they think it is new!  They are a good tight feeling car and gives a nice solid ride which is not too mushy.  You can feel the road, not like a BMW, but not bad.

Overall, I am very happy with it and plan on owning it for a long time.<br><br>
