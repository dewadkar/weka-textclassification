            You can tell your friend with the Ford to put that ugly six-banger back in the garage. Enter Chevy Camaro: Although she's not known as the prettiest girl on the block, she sure has a great personality.

The Chevrolet Camaro convertible is far and away that best bang for the buck. Even with it�s outstanding power complimented by responsive steering, you won�t be put in the poor house after you get the bill.

Available in three models [Sport, Z28, and Super Sport] this convertible�s devious styling puts a new spin on the early morning drive to the office. Despite what one might think, this car is a very handsome ride. With leather wrapped interior and speed-controlled radio volume, you need not go to a foreign dealer in search of comfort. The Camaro�s body, highlighted by clean, elegant lines, looks fabulous but doesn�t scream for the cops.

The absence of policing eyes is perfect for this racer in disguise. Under the innocent hood lies a monster. A monster in the form of a pushrod 16 valve V-8 (5665cc) with aluminum block and heads, GM engine-control system, and port fuel injection. Even for a droptop this animal will knock your socks off. Busting out 320 bhp @ 5200 rpm you�ll be up at 60 mph within 5.3 seconds. Need more, how about a top speed of 160 miles per hour? It's simple with the smooth shifting of the 6-speed manual transmission. Not bad for a car you will only be paying between $15,700-$30,500 for.

With all the amenities such as anti-lock brakes, Goodyear F1 GS radials (17�), and anti-roll bars this devil is ready to heat up the pavement.

This well engineered vehicle is up against two old rivals: Pontiac Firebird and Ford Mustang. While these other pony cars may have enhanced their sex appeal as of late, those hunks of metal under the hood that actually warrant a response to the driver�s touch, have not fared so well. As for the Camaro, power flows from it's mighty cylinders like honey from a beehive and quick handling is as limitless as the imagination.

After driving one of these great convertibles and hearing the ominous boom of the engine, you�ll never think twice. My advice, go out and get one this year and enjoy summer sun properly. You may not get many more chances seeing as the Canadian plant that builds them will cease production most probably after the 2001 model year.  <br><br>
