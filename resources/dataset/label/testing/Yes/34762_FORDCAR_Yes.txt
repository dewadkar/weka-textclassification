            Description...
1998 Ford Escort ZX2
2.0 liter Z-tech engine
5 speed
Red, alloy wheels, AC + Heating
65,000 miles

Performance...
  The Zx2 had a nice little get up and go when I bought the car.  If you want a fast car and don't have much $, do not buy this car.  They start out with only 130 horses.  I have the 5 speed which helps out with the acceleration; but, I could only imagine how slow a automatic would be of this car...  I spiced up my car but adding a Tenzo quick shifter knob.  What it is, is a weighted shifter knob so you can essentially "throw" it in gear much faster.  It works very well, but if you want to get serious just buy a short shifter rod on ebay for about $70-$80.  The next item i did to help "pump up" the horses a bit is, I put a straight back pipe from the exaust.  After I did that I put on a high flow muffler to let out a lot of exaust, and yet keep the sound somewhat bearable.  This helped considerable.  The neighbors hate my car but o well, :)  I have been to many Zx2 websites and looked at cold air intakes.  What I did learn from this is that they are very expensive but increase the horsepower 4-6 horses.  Me being as broke as I am then looked into performance air filters.  What I ended up buying is a K&N performance air filter from a local auto shop for about $70.  This was a wise investment.  it helped beef up the engine and just as well, gave her a nice little pur.

Stopping...
  My car has calipers in the front and drums in the back.  A fun easy thing to do to your Zx2 if your bored and want to customize your car is to paint the outside of your breaks.  You can go to your local auto store and buy a matching color of your car, in high temperature resistant paint.  Now, before you would paint make sure to scrub them down with a metal brush to get of the rust and any dirt or grime stuck on there.  Once you are done with that, take an airhose and spray off all the grime.  Once that is done, apply several layers, with time to let the paint dry.  Caution, do NOT touch the breaks, or paint on them if they are hot.  They turn red hot when heavily used.
  I have only had break fad a couple times since I have owned the car.  These breaks are not made for racing, thats for sure.  If you want to throw down an extra $200 you can get some racing breaks installed which would of course help.  
  Also, if you buy the break pads and install them yourself you will save about $40.  (I would also highly reccomend buying the guide to your car.  It will end up saving you tons of money in the end.)

Tires...
  P185R95=A VERY EXPENSIVE TIRE!  Just recently I had to replace my factory tires.  When I was calling around to see how much just a cheap pair of snow and mud tires would be I was udderly amazed.  3 places I called never had that size in stock nor could they order it.  Many places I called had to order them special and the total would come out to about $415 put on.  Finally, I called a local tire shop and they didn't have the size either but the had P195R90's in stock, for only $52 a piece.  So, it all came out to about $250 all together.  I also feel the swirl alloy rims are very tacky.  I used to own a 1993 Ford Probe that also had swirl rims, those also looked very ugly.  Even the 5 star they put on some Escorts look too small.

Pros...
  Its a fun little sporty afforable car.  It has a ton of potential, its acceleration is moderate with a manual transmission, it gets GREAT gas mileage, the Zx2 SR is faster than a Probe GT, and handles very very nicley.

Cons...
  The resale on the car depreciates very rapidly, Parts are very scarce, It has a Oval dash configuration, which means you have to buy a new face plate if you want a CD if there isn't one standard, Reputation isn't the best, not much horsepower stock and backseat space is very limited.
