            I recently bought the Olympus C2500L slightly used but in perfect condition.

The first thing that impressed me is the look and feel of the camera. Though it cannot compare to the old original Olympus cameras, it is still a pleasure to operate it and use it.

But, moving on to using it. The camera has 3 settings. An fully automatic, semi automatic and manual. With the fully automatic, it's as simple as point and shoot with autofocus, autoflash, etc. 
By using the semiautomatic or manual setting, you are able to set up a lot of features and settings, which will make it possible to make more or less photographich art.

Included in the pack is an 8 MB SmartMedia card. I would highly recommend that you buy some more, as this one only holds about 8 pictures on a medium resolution. But, as the camera supports both SM and CF, it shouldn't be that big a problem.

You also should be aware of the fact then the camera uses batteries, meaning that you can't charge the camera while using it. The batteries have to be removed from the camera. The pro is that you can buy extra batterypacks, but the con is that if you only have one set, it will take a lot of the batteries to transfer the images from the camera to the computer.

That said, I think it is important to remember that the camera makes really good images! The lack of extra equipment can be bought if needed - it's easier to buy extra batteries, than better image quality.

As mentioned as a con, there is a tendency to create noise on some images with a even colored background or area. That is however the only bad thing I can say about the camera. I've made some great nature shots as well as pictures of people - I can highly recommend this camera! Especially at this low price.
