            The Insight is quite unique in that it's a hybrid vehicle with an electric and gas engine. It has a generator (Back?) that recharges the batteries in conjunction with breaking and going down inclines (Sometimes just stepping lightly on the gas will do it). 

The digital instrument panel is quite unique (Yet probably will become more common), which is good and bad. It looks cool and futuristic, yet analog is nice and a classic. Maybe having an analog setup with the dial and numbers being digital, yet may just be a preference. 

The CVT transmission is quiet smooth, yet gets worse gas mileage than the manual. This is my first ever car being automatic (Since it was a sale price... and only automatics on lot avaible), but it doesn't shift at all, quite smooth as opposed to the classic 4 speed auto.

It only has two seats which can be a minus. This car is for someone who lives in the city, a college student (Hell if you have to pay your own gas bill), a single person or married without kids, etc... Not for someone who is common to having to carry around tons of people. (Ford is coming out with the 2003 Ford Escape hybrid for someone who really needs room). The Prius is also avaible yet it has design that just makes it look unfuturistic and just fruity.

Audiosystem is... well odd for the main sticker price. Replacing the center audio console with a good cd player etc... should do the trick. Get one with atleast 40 per channel. The speakers aren't to bad with the correct player. Getting new speakers after that would improve it, but for the avg. person just replacing the cassete deck will do fine. (Why the hell didn't they include a CD player for the price?)

The suspension is goofy, you feel everything that's on the road. Hitting a pothole will make you think that the car has just fallen apart...

The pickup going out into traffic isn't bad at all either. Despite the numbers 76hp aprx. it doesn't feel like it. Since the body is extremely light, it doesn't need tons of horsepower for pickup into traffic. Just letting it go up to 3,000 rpms going out into traffic will give you fine pickup. Haven't really gunned it yet since just breaking it in.

The design quality of the Insight is good yet some parts are just avg. It's sticker price of $19,000 aprx (mid range) is quite high, yet it's for the technology. If you can't find it on sale, and no trade in (Which I got both) or find a good priced used one... Unless you're crazy about it go look at the Honda HX which gets very good gas mileage also (for much less on the car)

Despite shortcomings, it's up and rising technology in cars, yet it's not like fuel cells. It's also made by Honda which is a good company.
