            I am not going to list all the specs of this Kodak model as you can find them at the Kodak website. I am going to focus on my opinion of this camera and tell you how I use it listing what works and what doesn't. 

First off, I purchased this camera to take pictures of items I plan to auction at eBay. For this purpose it does the job extremely well. The only problems I've had are taking close up shots. But normal pictures show excellent sharpness and color contrast. If you are looking for a very simple to operate camera then this Kodak would be a great choice. 

I looked at the Nikon Coolpix 990 and Olympus C2020. Both are excellent cameras and if you are looking for even more control settings take a look at these two. They will cost you a few dollars more than the Kodak but they both take excellent pictures. 

But I wanted a point and shoot camera that both my spouse and myself could use. I didn't want to mess around with lots of settings. I just wanted to be able to pull out the camera and take a few pictures when we have friends and family over as well as take with us on vacation. If this is how you plan to use your digital camera then the Kodak will work well for you. 

A few items of interest. If you do decide on this camera I suggest taking a look at www.killerapp.com where you can search for the lowest price online. You can price compare very easily. I could not find this model for under $700 six months ago in the Seattle area, but I found it for just over $500 online. I am sure you can find this model for under $500 now. 

Also, pickup an extra set of rechargeable batteries. You will go through batteries quickly. I average about 30 pictures before they need recharging. I also purchased a parallel port card reader for about $50. You can also use the supplied USB cable to move pictures from the camera over to your computer but this drains batteries. For about the cost of an AC Adapter (which is not included) you can purchase a card reader. I initially didn't think this would be a big deal but I've thanked my friend over and over for suggesting a card reader. 

I've been happy with my purchase of the DC-280. Anyone looking for a simple digital camera who doesn't need lots of professional setting should enjoy this model.
