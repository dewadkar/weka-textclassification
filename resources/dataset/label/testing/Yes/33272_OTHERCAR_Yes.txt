            I have never been a &quot;van person&quot;. I always imagined myself a sports car type. When I first got my mini-van that all changed. The Plymouth Voyager is a must for anyone with kids. The van is small enough to park in just about any spot that a regular sized car would fit yet large enough to carry your kids, shopping and pets.  
I must admit it does look a little like an egg and I would really like better stereo and heating vents in the back. You might be able to upgrade your stereo and heating and cooling system. 
Driving the Plymouth Voyager is like driving a regular size car. It's easy to handle, easy to park and it's great on long trips.  It has outlets where you can plug in a television or computer(with converter)great for road trips.
If you have kids or pets or both you this is your vehicle. <br><br>
