            First, let me just tell you that if you are thinking about other cars in this class and price range, look no further. The Mazda Protege is #1.

I primarily bought this vehicle because of its styling. I never considered owning a Mazda vehicle as my first car until they produced the newly redesigned Protege model. I have the 2000 model. It looks great and that is what drew me in. 

I tested many cars before I decided on the Protege. These include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Dodge Neon and Toyota Echo. After completing the test drives, I was convinced that the Mazda Protege was the best of the bunch. Its fit and finish is much more up-scale and its value is second to none. You get a lot for the money. I've got the SE model which includes a CD player as standard equipment. That was a big plus as many other competitors charged extra for this feature. I ordered mine with the automatic transmission and air conditioning. These two options can hamper an automobile's performance but not here. The Protege is my little race car!
 
It handles great in all types of conditions. I live in Toronto, Canada, and it snows a lot in the winter. The Protege had no problems with the cold weather or the snow filled streets. Now it is spring/summer, and it's getting hot outside. Washing it and making it shine puts a smile on my face. This car is gorgeous! 

Its compact size is perfect for me as I live in the city. With the stop and go traffic and the tight parking spaces, my Mazda can handle whatever comes its way. It also gets great gas mileage. This car is optimal for young people like me who want an economical car but one which combines quality, styling, value and FUN! It suits my active lifestyle. I'm always on the go and my Protege is always ready. This car would also be perfect for small families, young professionals and the elderly. It is universal in its appeal and is able to adapt to most anyone's lifestyle. 

It has been six months now, and I haven't had one problem yet. Compared with cars which cost thousands more that my parents have owned, my Protege beats them hands down. My mom and dad agree that my Protege is awesome. They want to drive it instead of their own cars!

All in all, the Mazda Protege is amazing and there is nothing that I would rather have. It is THE BEST!<br><br>
