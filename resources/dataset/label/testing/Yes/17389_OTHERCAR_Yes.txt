            The Volvo S60, 2002.

Rounded of the Corners.


I always believed that Volvo made some very good cars. I personally never owned one but I have rode and driven in many.

It seems that some of my friends, in-laws and business associates all felt it were the car to own.

The first time I rode and drove in one, was when I attended the police academy back in 1972. It was located about one hundred miles from where I lived and myself with three other candidates would drive there on Sunday night for a week of training and returning home every Friday and this went in for four straight months and all this was in a Volvo.

I do not remember exactly which model it was, I do remember it was a fairly large car.  and it was very comfortable inside whether sitting in the front or back. I was a good car to drive until it broke down and it did it 3 or 4 times during that period.

Well I am certain the Volvo engineers resolved these problems by now.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The new 2002 Volvo S60 is born to replace the Old Swedish dependable auto the Volvo S70. Looking at the S60 and you will know right away that there was very big change in the Volvo design room at one point in the past. I wonder how much resistance the bold designer was received when he/she introduced what would be the new style of the S60 for the Millenium.

It must have gone at this at that first meeting. "Ok boys, her is what I propose. Out with the soapbox look, lets round of some corners give the S60 a sporty allure and we will market it as a sedan". Some of the older designers must have been rolling on the floor laughing.

Regardless of what happen in Sweden that particular day, the winners will be the consumer who buy the newly designed Volvo, not only will they get one of the safest cars on the road they will have be driving a stylish vehicle at the same time.

They have designed a car that should appeal to the younger generation and still keep their older clients happy.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As for all the other Volvo I have driven in the past thirty years, the S60 offers the driver lots of head and legroom. The seats are orthpaedically designed and heated if the need arises. They are certainly one of the most comfortable car seats ever designed keeping in touch with what Volvo always prided themselves with having the safest and most comfortable seats.

The rear seats are also very comfortable but the space is a little tighter for the legs. As always one of Volvos top selling points is with the safety aspects of their cart and the S60 comes equipped with Whiplash Protection System, 2 front and side impact airbags and an inflatable curtain as safety standard equipment.

All the gages and the controls are easy to see and reach, I did find that there seem to be too many buttons for the climate control system, it seems they could have simplified this somehow.  

The air conditioning system comes with a pollen filter; this will greatly be appreciated for families with members who suffer from asthma.

The exterior:

It feels odd to write about an exterior of a Volvo and present it as a stylish looking auto but this is exactly what I saw in the S60. Every thing is well proportionned and fits very well. I feel that the paint could have had a better finish and this is maybe a slight defect the dealer could remedy.

I also find the side view mirrors to be a little too small but the blind spot is still quite acceptable. 

The alloy wheel gives the car a sporty but still refine look.

THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Under the hood of the S60 you will find:

Engine: A turbocharged 2.3 liters motor, 5-cylinders developing 247 horsepower.

           Whiplash protection system.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

It was a real pleasure to drive the S60; I took it for a spin in a beautiful mountainous region of the Northeast. The car is very easy to drive, in and out of the city. It may not be the perfect automobile but it sure is very close.
