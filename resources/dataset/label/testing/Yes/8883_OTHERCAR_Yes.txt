            As the description states, only the young and the young at heart should buy this vehicle for it was made with them in mind. My daughter bought
this car recently and it has been pure heaven for her and my son. I must admit it moves when you want it to and as well as when you need it. It can take a curve with no stress to the body and without screeching tires. It's look is sleek as a woman's physique and as classy as they come.It purrs even when you are warming the engine on a cold winter's day. It is surprisingly good on gas and can stop on a dime if needed. Heads turn no matter who's at the wheel and nothing beats getting noticed.

A few things to consider before buying this vehicle is the cost of insurance; yes it's costly, also, there is not a lot of space for additional passengers unless you are a loner. The price can be scary unless you do your homework before contacting a dealer. No more bad news, but a few more things I would like to mention about the car is the superb sound system which is supported by six, yes I said, &quot;SIX&quot; speakers!!! I am also impressed with the use of the vents to defrost the front, side and rear windows in a matter of seconds which in turn heats the entire vehicle. The suspension is great for muffling the effects of traveling over railroad tracks and potholes in the road. But alas, my knees are no longer young so this young at heart person must drive this great car less than I would like to.<br><br>
