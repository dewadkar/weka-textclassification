            Below I have included a detailed maintanence list.

I bought my V6 Grand Am SE coupe in 1994, one year used. I have graduated highschool, college and medschool with this car. I still love driving this car and feel it gave me great service over the years. I have 130k miles on it now and will not get rid of it. Still purrs like a kitten. 

Exterior styling looked very unique and hot when it came out in 1992 and even this day other cars are copying it.  It still looks really modern unlike a 1993 Toyota or Honda. 

Over the years I have enjoyed the performance of this car especially the low end torque it has. None of these modern multivalve engines in its class can match it. Unfortunately, in 1993 the 3.3L v6 was matched up with a 3 speed auto so the powerband dies out around 75mph.
At 130k miles it still gives me 20 miles city and 30miles highway driving fairly aggressive. 

Handling is decent in this car, but would suggest bigger wheels and tires than my 14 inchers.

Interior space is more than enough in front and adequate in the rear. The interior is highly functional but the plastic does look cheap after all these years. No cracks or problems but the monotone charcoal hard plastic just doesnt look expensive.

Radio is suprisingly good for a stock system. It has big 6x9's in the rear for low base. Aftermarket stereos are cheap for this car and do wonders to the stock system.

Overall I think this car gave me awesome service and was fun to drive and easy to maintain. Would recommend it highly.

Maintainence Problems in detail with this car:

1.Brakes wear out like socks. Every 12-15k miles i needed front pads. I signed up lifetime pads at a local shop so it ended up to cost me around $40 a year.

2.waterpump was replaced at around 65k miles. making a funny noise

3. Battery and Alternator replaced twice but could be because of high wattage of my aftermarket stereo.

4. radiator hose replaced twice because of softening

5. Clogged hose for heater replaced at 90k miles

6. shocks and stuts replaced at 70k miles

7. max air flow filter clogged at 85k miles

8. Fog light casing burns out every 20k miles. $85

9. Tune up at every 45k miles

10. Engine mount cracked at 100k miles
