            With 15 year experience in automobile consulting and sales, it is my opinion that the Subaru Legacy LX model automatic fully loaded is an all-weather automobile that is highly efficient for its job.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite have the power within its motor package to get you up the hill in time to pick up your children.  Although it rides very nice, and has all the luxury that you would like to have in a luxury automobile, it would be nice to have the power in the automobile that the manufacturers owe the consumers.  For someone who drives just in town and wants something reliable in bad weather, its a good car.  For someone who wants to go on long trips or lives in a hilled area where bad weather is frequent, I think that there are other automobiles that would better fit their needs.<br><br>
