            I purchased the truck because its truly got it all.  Good looks on the outside, as well as the inside.  Power to haul, power to pull, wether it be the camper or just us and the kids.  Its roomy - I mean really roomy.
It great to drive, smooth and not trucky at all.  The steering ratio isn't great, but I can certainly except it.  The truck has everything going for it.  Its a real truck, unlike a SUV.  The 4-wd is powerful enough to get you where your going.  I absolutely love the way the truck looks.  It has quite a presence and demands attention, much like myself.
What I hate about it, besides of course the monthly payment, is the high climb up.  I recommend running boards or its a big climb in and a long jump down. This is a great truck for anybody who needs a pick-up for work or play, but also wants to be able to take their family or their buddies along.  <br><br>
