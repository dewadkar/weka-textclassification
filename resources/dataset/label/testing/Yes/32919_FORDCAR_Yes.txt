            I own a 2000 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab with flaresides. This is what a small truck should be. I bought the truck used with 16,000 miles on it in June 1999. It now has over 40,000 miles on it, and I have absolutely no complaints.

 I recently resigned from a job delivering blueprints which took me , daily, to construction sites in various stages of completion. My truck is <b>NOT</b> a 4x4, but you wouldn't know it by the way it handles under tough conditions. I have driven it through deep mud, huge puddles, snow, ice, gravel (both small and large stone), and monster ruts carved by the steady stream of fully loaded dump trucks entering a job site. Yep, it's been a bouncy ride at times, but isn't that the fun of a truck?

 I have loaded it down with who knows how many pounds at a time (enough for the mud flaps to drag, and my truck sits pretty high), and taken it out on the highway at full speed, with virtually no change in the handling, acceleration, or braking.

 When taking a "pleasure drive", or just running down the road to the grocery store this thing is awesome! I love being higher up than most of the other drivers. I love the feel of being inside a truck cab as opposed to a car, which feels much too open for my taste. I love that I can actually feel the road, a rarity these days with all the super-quiet, "smooth-ride" vehicles out there.

One other thing that I love about my Ranger is the space inside. I'm 5'10" , and I have plenty of room to move the seat either up or back from where my comfort level is. My father, at 6'2" can also fit with no problem. And the seats are really comfortable. I should know as I've spent 9 and 10 hour working days in them. That counts for a lot!

 On the whole, I can't recommend the Ranger enough. Never had a problem with it, no matter what I put it through (read: I'm terrible at keeping up with oil changes). Two thumbs up! 5 stars! The cream of the crop!<b> Love my Ranger!!!</b>
