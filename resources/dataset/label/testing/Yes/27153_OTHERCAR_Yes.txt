            This review of the 1998 Chevrolet Astro will not contain a lot about the engine, the transmission, the tires, etc. We bought this car with 28,000 miles on it and have had it about a year and a half. One weird thing happened in the beginning -- the &quot;Service Engine Immediately&quot; light came on and stayed on. We had it checked out a couple of times and it seems the problem was with the light itself. No trouble at all since. Other than regular check-ups and oil changes, this car has been maintenance-free. Before buying it, we had a mechanic we trust look it over and he gave it a thumbs up. He said that with these new cars, when they hit 100,000 miles, &quot;they're just getting broken in good.&quot;

When my husband and I began looking for a used vehicle in 1998, we had one major consideration in mind. Because our daughter and her family number six people, and our son and his family number five people, we wanted a vehicle which would seat 8 people comfortably so that we could carry ourselves and either family in one car. And because several of our grandchildren are teen-aged boys and are tall, we wanted a back seat which would have plenty of leg room. I sat in the back seats of every car we looked at. 

There are two big plusses for the Astro. The middle seat will actually hold 3 adult people comfortably. It was the only model we found which will do that. And there is plenty of leg room in the back seat -- more than in any other vehicle we looked at.

This past summer we took a long trip with three of our teen-aged grandsons, and that trip showed me that 8 people would not be able to travel really comfortably on LONG trips. The five of us did fine; but with 8 people, there simply would not be enough room to move around. But, for going out to eat or to the mall, or for trips of 1- or 2-hour duration, this vehicle definitely fills the bill. Because of that, when we visit our son or our daughter, we don't have to take two cars everywhere. This is EXACTLY what we wanted. 

We have had Chevrolet products in the past and have always been happy with their performance and reliability, so we had no worry from that perspective about buying the Astro. And it has been a very reliable, trouble-free vehicle. We have a history of keeping cars for a pretty long time. In fact, the vehicle we replaced with the Astro was a Chevrolet Suburban, 1976, which we had bought used in 1978 and which was on its 3rd engine, with 400,000+ miles on it. We hated to give it up! But I think we are going to enjoy the Astro just as much. We're looking forward to a long and happy relationship.<br><br>
