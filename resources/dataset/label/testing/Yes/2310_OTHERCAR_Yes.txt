            When searching for a new car, the KIA caught our eye because of its very reasonable price.  The test drive convinced me of the cars comfort and power.  Now that I own the car I feel like I am driving a fine high priced luxury car. I love the room and comfort it allows for a family of four, 2 adults and two teens.  I drive approximately 40 miles everyday to and from work, the drive is pure pleasure.  What I find I appreciate most is the speed at which the air conditioner or heater perform.  My only complaint would be the windshield wipers, which after having some problems we pulled into the dealership and were fixed immediately.  
I think anyone looking for a good affordable sedan should purchase the KIA, I know I would buy it again.<br><br>
