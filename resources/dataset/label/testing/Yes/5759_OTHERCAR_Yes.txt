            At the price of a decent sedan I got myself an ultra reliable supercar with all wheel drive which corners like a dream and still leaves me smiling every time I park it.

The Porsche 911 is one of the all time greats. I had never really considered one being a die hard Ferrari fan and one time Jaguar Product Planner. But, I was in the market for a car with :

1. Great Performance
2. Outstanding Handling
3. Space for wife and two young daughters (7 and 4)
4. Ultimate reliability - this is my daily to work car
5. Cool looks
6. No more than $35000 

Well the 911 C4 stand out i n a class of its own. With 4 wheel drive it handles like a dream and for the winter here in CT would be great. 

Performance is 'adequate' 0-60mph in 5.2 seconds is not bad, and as for top speed I know there's plenty..over 150mph I think.

Space is fine...as long as your kids are like mine. Should they be mid to late teens it gets a bit tricky. But then they just need to learn how to occupy less space.....

The great thing about Porsche is their legendary reliability. I have thus far, apart from a small relay problem the first day (50 cent part) found that reputation to be justified. I drive the car daily 40 miles each way through windy roads plus a small interstate section and the car is simply fantastic.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I cannot honestly say that the 911 comes close to a Lamborghini, Ferrari or Maserati. The 911 is basically a stretched VW Beetle (just like the new Audi TT is a squashed one. But, it has presence. The style is all about Power rather than grace and over the years I have grown to admire the design (or is it just post-rationalization?)

At the price these cars cost for a top quality used car with full Porsche warranty they are hard to beat. Basically for 12 months everything is covered so even if something should go wrong (e.g. 50 cent relay) then you are covered. Try and get a new car that comes close - the Audi TT certainly doesn't but is a good pretender.

I got the car from a reputable Porsche dealer after first getting in touch with a few guys from the Porsche Club of N America. It is worth checking these guys out before you buy as they are a fountain of knowledge and really willing to help. The Porsche dealer was Danbury Porsche in Connecticut - these people are very very good.

The car is a joy to drive. Sure footed, it will only catch you out if you do something silly but is easily corrected. Ride comfort is not one of its strong points but then neither is it intended to be. The car's suspension is tuned to maximize handling dynamics which means inevitably that ride suffers. You are fine on smooth roads but anything with excessive bumps will be felt all the way up your spine.

Living with the car is easy and its a perfect car for someone who wants something a bit different than the mundane junk that comes out of most factories these days. If you are looking for something fast, dynamic and are not too bothered about space then the 911 is the car. The C4 has all wheel drive which I reckon I need but if 2 wheel drive is enough then the C2 is the one for you.

Oh! Forgot to say that the cup holder rattles a bit..but then who needs coffee...
