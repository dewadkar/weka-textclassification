            Want a luxury car without drowning in monthly payments? The Acura 3.2 TL is what you have been looking for!!  My husband wanted a luxurious car that he could drive his clients around in, but with 3 kids we didn't want to strap ourselves with a huge monthly payment.  The 3.2TL was the perfect solution.  Most people warned us that there would be a long wait, but if you call enough dealerships (I called 15) you will find what you want.  The exterior is sleek and elegant, and the interior is comfortable and plush.  This sedan seats 5, and can fit 3 car seats in the back seat.  The designers even included a pass through from the trunk to the back seat for those hard to fit items such as skis or hockey sticks.  The drive is incredibly smooth and has a lot of zip.  In the year that we have owned this car we have never had to have any service done on it(except for an oil change).  We have previously owned an Acura Integra, and a Legend  and we are still convinced that the people at Acura know what they are doing.   Perhaps the best feature of this vehicle is that my husband and I no longer argue about him asking for directions, we just let the navigation system lead the way!
