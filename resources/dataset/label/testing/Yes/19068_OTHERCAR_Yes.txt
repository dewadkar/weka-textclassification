            I have taken lots of photos, developed and printed, as a fun hobby.  This camera has rekindled my picture taking joy.  Photo quality is excellent.  Depth of field superb.  Easy to use as a point and shoot or via easy to use menu, be totally creative.  I take 20-30 shots, download to PC pick the best, delete the rest.  Immediate gratification.  Email pics to friends, upload to family web site, great prints on HP Inkjet.

I have and love an Olympus compact zoom 35mm so I choose to look first at the C2020Z after reviews and study, I purchased the 2020Z.  It exceeds my expectations.  Paid $699 last month, now ecost is under $580 and auctions can be under $500.  I wanted it quickly and outpost.com delivered that Saturday.

Quickly bought a 32M Scandisk and a USB reader.  Super fast, seconds per photo, strongly recommend.  64M a little too expensive.  Just got accessory kit, need to protect the back screen, soft plastic.

During our upcoming European vacation, I'll be sending out daily photos.<br><br>
