            I live in Colorado and if you are going to own a truck, it had better be a 4x4.  I decided to buy a new Toyota Tacoma TRD because I had owned a Toyota 4x4 for years.  It's reliable, easy to work on and upgrade, and the quality is unparalleled.  
This new TRD model is unbelievable.  Within 48 hours, I had this vehicle climbing a 30 - 45 degree incline over rocks the size of my dog (he's a 75 lb. husky), with snow and mud and trees, etc..  This truck took the Slaughterhouse Loop (the trail name) on my first run and didn't even blink.  
On the road, it's just as impressive.  Good pickup by the V6 and the interior is super comfy.  Don't expect this vehicle to ride like a car.  It won't!  It's a truck and it feels like one.  The upside to this is that you can feel the road, which helps in adverse conditions.  The only thing I don't like is the Goodyear Wranglers it comes equipped with.  They don't have a very solid sidewall and it makes on-road cornering a bit squirelly.  But that is easily remedied.  Get some BFG's!  
If you can, and you want a great vehicle, but this truck.  I guarantee you'll have fun with it!!<br><br>
