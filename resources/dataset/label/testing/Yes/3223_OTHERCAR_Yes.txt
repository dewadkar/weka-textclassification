            I purchased this car after a 5 minute test drive.  To summarize my impressions - I could not see anything bad with this car.  I had been looking for a new car for several weeks and grew weary of dancing the dealers' "two-step".  They were mostly polite and eager for my business but hours were wasted arranging for a test drive then trying to duck out when I didn't really want their car.  The C-280 was the fifth vehicle I checked out, based on positive press reviews and a surprisingly affordable advertised price.

Other cars I had considered were the Volvo S60, Volkswagen Passat GLS, Audi A6, Mazda Milennia and Acura 3.2TL.  Only the Audi seemed comparable in refinement and handling to the C280.  Prices were also comparable but I had concerns about the rapid depreciation on the Audi.  I should also mention that the Passat in full leather was also a terrific car but I was put off by the short warranty period - only 2 Years!  It's tough to find negatives with the well-optioned Acura except to point out the general feel of the car is just not in the same league as the Benz.  Also the Benz has that ultra-neat, articulating, single windshield wiper.

In Canada only the C230K and C280 were offered for the 2000 model year.  I found the 230 kinda loud and although it has competent acceleration, the 280 delivers more low-end torque so I can feel the acceleration from stop lights and at on-ramps.  The 280 also seems quieter in the cabin.  The base 280 cost about 15% more than the comparable 230K.

Fuel economy was a concern with the 6 cyl but the C280 was fine at 35mpg compared with the C230K at 38mpg.  I calculated that the premium-only fuel would cost about $120 per year more than regular at 15,000 miles/yr, so no great concern.  My actual fuel economy in a 60/40 mix hwy/city has been about 32mpg.

I had considered lease or purchase financing but Benz rates were high (10 to 12%) so I got a better rate from my local bank.

Safety was a factor in my choice. I relied on Benz' reputation for an excellent "safety cage" and the C class comes with standard front and side airbags.  The front passenger airbag is automatically disabled when using a compatible child seat. 

Insurance rates were very reasonable at $950/yr with 6 years without accidents and tickets, but my insurer required a minimum deductible of $700 for collision and comprehensive.  Liability limit was $1 million.  

I wanted a car immediately and the dealer had the color combo I preferred right on the lot.  The price was not negotiable which precluded another dance routine and I drove the car off the next day.  While I wasn't treated like royalty, I definitely appreciated the higher level of customer service and attention at the Benz dealer and will definitely make the trip to keep my car serviced there in the future.

The only really negative thing was the standard equipment radio which sounds anemic and has only a cassette player.  Benz wanted $700 for the pre-wired CD changer in the trunk but that wouldn't improve the sound.  The better-than-standard Bose sound from Benz was $700 - but I would have had to factory order the car with that option and even then, no boomer and no CD changer.  I opted for a complete new Blaupunkt AM/FM/CD and in-dash 5 disc changer  with Rockford Fosgate amplifiers and sub-woofer.  From the local car hi-fi experts, installed for $1,800.  

With the audio sorted out, covered by 4 years of excellent warranty and roadside assistance, I'm looking forward to several years of enjoying this car.
