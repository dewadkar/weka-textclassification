            I had this vehicle for 2 years, and when I traded it in, it had over 120k miles on it. I had an EX model. The color was Rosewood (a metallic bronzeish color) and the interior was burgundy. It was a WONDERFUL car and I wish I had never sold it. 

This car was the best of both worlds: sporty (coupe, spoiler, alloy wheels) and economical (great mileage, low repairs). The only mechanical problems I had were few and far between. I had one power window go off the track, which was repaired fairly cheaply. I also had an alternator problem, but Honda provided the new part for free since it had been a recall. That was all (barring normal maintenance) over the 2 year period. I liked the layout of the car, and all the little touches. The cupholders were well-placed, the little drawer to the left of the steering wheel was handy for toll change and tokens, the armrest was adjustable, and it had lumbar support. The back seats were roomy and had compartments to store stuff in. The upholstery and carpeting were of excellent quality. The carpet was very thick, thicker than the Chrysler 300M I have now (and it's a 'luxury' car!). I also liked the oil change notice feature: insert the key in the dash when you have your oil changed, and the indicator turns green. When you need a change, it will turn red. There is also a lock on the trunk release so that a valet can't open your trunk if you give them the valet key. The key won't work and the trunk release won't either. Smart! The moonroof was also very nice and didn't leak or cause added wind noise. 

The only cons are that this is a 4-cylinder engine, so it's not got a ton of pickup, especially once you reach the higher speeds. But if you aren't all about power, this is an excellent car. It's incredibly reliable and will go forever if you take care of it. I have test driven newer Accords since I had this one, and haven't liked them near as much. <br><br>
