            The old GS was pretty good. The &quot;Next&quot; Lexus as it had been dubbed when the line was introduced in 1993/1994 combined the refinement of the flagship LS400 with the speed and agility of the potent SC sports coupe series. But alas, the first GS flopped. When Lexus went back to the drawing board however, they came-up with something that is made to knock the competition's socks off. I should preface this by saying that I did not buy this vehicle (though it was in the running) but I still think that it deserves major points for being the performer that it is. Competing with the Mercedes E-Class, the BMW 5-Series, The Infiniti I/J-series, and now with the Jaguar S-Type, the Lexus has quite a bit of competition but still easily comes-out on or near the top.

The new GS comes in two flavors, the GS300 and the GS400. The GS300 has the Lexus V-6 and the GS400 comes with the silky-smooth V-8. After driving both, I must say that even though the GS300 was close to my price range, the GS400 would have been a more satisfactory buy. The pick-up is immediate, the ride is smooth, the engine is quiet, and the response is to die for. And 0-60 in about 6 seconds (and change) is not something to sneeze at for the hefty-built luxo that it is. In addition, I am (or would have been) a returning Lexus buyer so I know that the service (albeit expensive) is pretty darn reliable and the people at the dealership are just so darn nice. As an aside, BMW should be commended for offering the first 3 years worth of routine service with the price of the vehicle. I feel that other luxury car companies should follow suit and that they will have to in the future in order to remain competitive. Only one down-fall kept me from immediately sealing the deal.

Let's take the Bimmer, the E-Class, and the S-Type for example. Those are all cars that allow you to feel the road; they are driver's cars (the Bimmer more than the later two). The Lexus, on the other hand, is crafted for precision luxury and &quot;negative&quot; road feel and in my opinion, I feel less safe driving that vehicle than I do the Jag, for instance. And that's another thing that kinda bugs me...sitting in the cockpit of a GS reminds me of a more European car. As a matter of fact, I'll argue that the cockpit of the Lexus GS has old-world charm that the Jag, Mercedes, and Bimmer all lack. Yet it has a typical Japanese drive to it. Don't get me wrong, that's a really good thing; kudos to Lexus for being able to build something that truly and honestly combines the best of both worlds. But for a discriminating car buyer like myself, I want something that looks like it feels. That's why I'll harp on the Jaguar S-Type (the car we did end-up buying...please see my review of that for more info) because it's an all new Jag with an all new look and an all new feel. It lacks the schizophrenia exhibited by the Lexus (a car that looks like this and feels like that).

But there must have been some stuff that I loved about the car. And you know, it's always the little things about a car that make me happy. First, when the security alarm is engaged from the remote key, a quiet and typically Japanese chime is heard rather than a crude honk of the horn. With my Jag people must think that I'm screaming for attention by beeping the horn, but all I'm doing is arming the alarm. Also the instrumentation cluster on the Lexus is more easy to read than any other I've seen in my life. I'm just sorry that this automobile is not offered in manual transmission...would that be something!!!

So overall, my impression of this car is that it's for somebody who values a smooth ride and lives in a part of the country where they can afford to not worry about the road conditions. I live in the north-eastern portion of the country and feeling the road in icy conditions is  very important to me. This isn't a real concern because the GS comes with a traction control system to complement the rear-wheel drive, but it's more of a personal preference. I will say, however, that I am constantly turning my head to admire the new GS's as they're driven around in my neighborhood. If I could afford a second car in addition to the Jag, this is the car that I'd get!<br><br>
