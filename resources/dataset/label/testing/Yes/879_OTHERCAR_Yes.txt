            Warning: If you're looking for the "latest, greatest" and price is no object, move on now to another review. The C-3000 has been around for about two years.

This review is not a technical review that lists all the good and poor features of a digital camera. The Olympus Camedia 3000-Zoom has already had many informative praise-filled reviews written about it. This review is more of a "heads up!"

If you are hoping to spend no more than $200 to $300 for a 1 or 2 megapixel camera, but have discovered you be getting limited features and a low quality lens, why not consider a 3.3 meg digital camera that gives you the ability to capture and print excellent quality photos instead? I recently purchased an Olympus refurbished C-3000 for $239. Yes, the same camera that others have bought for 4, 5, 6 hundred dollars or more, is now available for under $300. As a matter of fact, on the day I wrote this review, September 5, 2002, there was a C-3000 listed on the Epinion site for $259 at Half.com.

You might ask,

"But what if I don�t want to get a refurbished camera?"

Expect to pay about $350 to $400 for a new-in-the-box C-3000. Be careful, some stores are still selling it for $600 or more.

"Does it allow the use of a remote?" 

Yes, the new C-3000 comes with a wireless remote. (The refurbished version often doesn't have a remote, but they are available on-line at camera shops and auctions.)

"How about tele, wide angle, close-up lens, and filters?" 

Yes, Olympus has them available on their web site, and there are many available at other on-line shops and auctions.

"How about a flash?"

It has a built-in flash that's suitable for most users, but if you need more flash, there are flashes and slave flashes available that work well with digital cameras like the C-3000Z.

"What don�t you like about it?" 

The lens cap! It�s not tethered to the body like many cameras. That makes it easy to lose. That's my only gripe!

"What�s the one thing you like the most about the camera?"

It takes excellent photos in a variety of situations.

That�s it!  If you need more information, go read what other Epinion reviewers have to say about this terrific camera. If you're ready to buy, check out the store info that follows this review.
