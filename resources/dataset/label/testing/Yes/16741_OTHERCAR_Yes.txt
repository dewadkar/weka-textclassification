            Those of you who frequent auction sites may have seen this Mustek VDC-3500 digital camera for suspiciously low prices.  Although you would think that a digital camera that doesn't cost $400 isn't any good, I have been pleased with the performance of this cheap little camera.

I bought it for my Mom, who wanted a digital camera so that she could take pictures of her quilts for the web and auction sites, without the hassle of using up the whole role of film and getting it developed.  She wasn't concerned so much with picture quality as much as she just wanted a simple way to get pictures into the computer fast.

This camera is great for those you who are not too keen on spending upwards of $400 for a really nice digital camera, but still would like to occasionally have the conveniences of a digital camera.  The picture quality is satisfactory, with reasonable color and resolution.  The interface with the computer is pretty easy to learn, but the software it comes to create albums and stuff is terrible.  If you happen to have some sort of good photo editing software, you should use that instead, since you only need to adjust the colors and brightness a little to get great looking photos.

It comes with a 2mb removable flash card that stores 8 images in high res (640x480, good quality) and 26 in low res(320x200, better for web pages and email).  The company's website has links to find additional flash cards, so you can have the equivalent of several rolls of film for a trip.

All in all, this is a pretty nice little camera for the low price.<br><br>
