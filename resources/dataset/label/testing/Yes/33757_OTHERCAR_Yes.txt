                 Before I begin my 1000+ word essay on a certain Italian, I'd like to make it clear that I'm no Collin McRae or David Coulthard. I'm just a university student with a driving licence with an interest in cars...

...and the keys to an Alfa 156 Selespeed!

     The 156 is a very special car in many ways. It is the first time I've come across a coupe which tries so hard to be a mini-executive sedan (or is it the other way round?). This car has surprised me in so many ways that I'm not even sure where to begin. I guess I'll start with the cockpit...



CHAPTER 1: Before driving...

     Upon placing yourself into the command seat you'll find several white coloured dials angled towards you (screening useless information such as the time from the front passenger). All of the controls seem to be perfectly positioned and there is enough room for the driver to go about his business; no elbow banging or silly obstructions to annoy the driver. The seats are really supportive and comfortable. 

     Outward visibility is superb but being 6 feet 2 inches tall, I sometimes feel that I'm sitting a tad too high (the rear-view mirror sometimes gets in my way). The wing mirrors are a bit on the small side too, cleverly hiding neighbouring motorcyclists from your view at times. The glove box is rather small too. Big enough for the instruction/service manual and... erm... a glove. The rear quarters too are a little snug and anybody over six feet would have extra padding from the ceiling. Heck, even the boot is small with a rather tiny opening. Come to think of it, I've seen bigger Honda Civics. Other than that, the interior is very well put together with Benz-like solidness and above all, looks which make you want to go really fast (ie: sporty). 



CHAPTER 2: The Selespeed transmission

     Around the city, the Selespeed transmission can be a bit of a chore to use. In 'City' mode (accessed by pressing a tiny button next to the gearshift) the Alfa transforms into an automatic, changing gears for you. The only problem is that this 'auto-box' seems a little lost at times. From standstill, the car is quite eager to stick in 1st (resulting in slightly jerky movements) and while the car is moving, it never shifts down to 1st (even if you're going uphill and there clearly isn't enough torque). Little irritations such as this often prompts you to use the Selespeed shift; the main reason for buying this particular model in the first place.

     The whole business about this gearbox being, simply, a manual gearbox without a clutch isn't quite so simple. Don't believe me? Well, Alfa Romeo has a thick instruction manual JUST for the gearbox! I have three little complaints:

     Firstly, the gears to not switch cogs the instant you press the '+' or '-' buttons on the steering wheel (or the sequential stick on the centre console). At first this might seem confusing, and the gearbox may seem to have a mind of it's own.

     Secondly, the gearbox shifts down automatically if the rev-meter drops too low; a bit of a problem when you also decide to shift down yourself. When this happens, you might find yourself suddenly two gears down, throwing your passengers forward in the process.

     Lastly, it is possible to shift into neutral at any time but to shift out of neutral, you MUST depress the brakes. This is rather dangerous if (like me) you are used to applying the handbrake when you stop at a traffic light. If you also happen to be on a slope at the same time, you may find yourself free-wheeling downhill if you forget to step on the brakes to shift out of neutral. 

     Now that I've got that off my chest, I must stress that all of these 'problems' can be ironed out once you get used to the gearbox (takes about a week or two). Once you do, that's where the fun begins. On an open road, the Selespeed transmission is a joy to use; you'll be pulling off perfect engine braking before corners in no time.


CHAPTER 3: Performance

     This car handles quite well for a front-wheel driven car. The steering itself is responsive and well weighted. Understeer is almost non-existant and it's only when you're going at about 105 mph around a bumpy medium speed corner when you suddenly realise that you're still a mere mortal. Even when the car does understeer, this can be easily controlled by easing off the throttle. The nose feels pretty light (considering that the whole engine sits in front of the front wheels). The suspension seems to handle the sudden shifts in direction (and weight) pretty well although you can feel the body roll a bit. The damping is excellent considering that this isn't any sports suspension package. The car never floats at high speeds and mid corner bumps are handled pretty well. Comfort is a different issue as even the smallest of bumps can still be felt.

     The 2.0 litre Twin Spark Engine is very torquey and goes all the way up to 7000 rpm. It also sounds fantastic, it may be a small in-line four but it roars like a much bigger engine. My only complaint is that while the power delivery is great from 3000 to 7000 rpm, the engine lacks pulling power below that. Not a problem if you are speeding on the highway but around town, this lack of low-end pulling power is a little disappointing. Having said that, the sudden burst of energy at 3000 rpm is rather addictive and brings a smile to your face (a bit like a turbo / VTEC outburst). The way the car is able to scream all the way towards the red-line (even in fifth) makes you wonder if there really is 'just' 155 BHP under the hood. It's very easy to creep up to 100 mph without realising it at times!

     The engine is wonderful, the handling is crisp... what else would you need?

CHAPTER 4: Final words...

     Basically, the Alfa 156 Selespeed is a sports coupe which happens to have an extra two doors. It isn't the most practical car around nor is it the fastest thing on wheels but it has a certain charm and character which few cars have these days. Considering that it costs less than a Honda Accord here in Malaysia I'd say that it's a steal (US$40,000 - US$30,000 for a car here is quite normal... the tax on foreign cars here is way over the top)<br><br>
