            First off, I will say this. American auto makers have came a long way when they introduce the Oldsmobile Alero. From the nice ride to the sporty performance it's an all around great car. Some of the best features that I like are the way the lights come on at night or dust without flipping a switch. They have a sensor that monitors the pressure of the tires and warns if a tire starts to go flat! 150,000 miles transmission and coolant system. It even has a sensor that monitors the oil and advises the owner when it needs to be changed. This is just to name a few. From the first day I rented the car in May 99, I knew that this was the next family car. 
Approx. 6 months later, I  owned my own. If you are in the market for a new car, you will notice that they all have some faults but it was hard for me to put my finger on any with the Alero. Oh sure the cup holders are not the best but if that's the only complaint, I'll take it. I love the looks of the car. Most folks that see my Alero are not sure what type of car it is or who makes it. It shocks them to learn that (GM) Oldsmobile has made such a nice car.  I opted for the V-6 3400SFI GLS model with the leather. Sports suspension and spoiler on the rear. With all the fancy features included I was impressed that the price did not make me run away. For the quality of car and the features I believe the price is very reasonable. I wish you the best of luck on your decision. Maybe one day we will see you on the www.alero.org web sight.

Thank you for reading.
