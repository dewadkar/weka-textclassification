            I bought this truck because of it's affordability, it's looks and most importantly, the deal. I really like the power of the 4.3 liter V-6 which happens to be the most powerful in the class. This truck gets decent gas milage at 19-23 mpg. 
My truck has cruise/tilt, extended cab, V-6, auto, LS trim, and Air Conditioning. I bought this truck for around 19,500 after taxes. 
The truck has great handling and I haven't had any warranty work done on it yet. The cab is spacious and very well put together. I would give this an overall score of 9 (scale 1-10 with 1 being the worst.)<br><br>
