            I bought this car in April of 2001 after my car accident.  I was looking for something reliable and nice looking as well as having anti-lock brakes (something my old car didn't have) something a little smaller (had a 1987 oldsmobile before).  It was 7 years old but had only 101,000 miles on it which isn't too bad.  I use it mainly to get to school and work and to drive across town to visit my boyfriend (I'm a geek).  It gets pretty good gas mileage and is easy to drive with much tighter handling than what I was used to.  But also had a much smaller engine than what I was used to.  Acceleration is a little slow but I can understand that because it's only a 3 gear, 4 cyl, 2.2L engine.  The only problems I've had with it so far are that I've had to replace the windshield washer fluid pump twice, it idles a little loud in drive (especially when the air is on), the wipers are in a bad place obstructing view slightly and I had to get a new door skin (but that was because of the car, it's because someone hit me).  The only really stupid thing about it is that when you go to fill the washer fluid you can't see the container so you have no idea how much is in there.  But it's a good little car and I'd recommend it to any single driver (not a family).
