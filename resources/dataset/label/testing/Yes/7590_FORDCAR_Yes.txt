            The two contenders - Ford Expedition &amp; Chevy Surburban.  Winner?  Ford Expedition!!  Yes I a dyed in the wool chevy man have switched!

Why you might ask?  Everyone knows that the surburban is better for towing and has more storage room.  Well the answer might surprise you. Even in America you can have too much of something.  Since it is just my wife and myself we needed a vehicle for travel and when we take others somewhere.

Recently, we took a nice trip to Kentucky from Texas.  We had room enough for our luggage, our friends and one very comfortable ride.  I would consider this vehicle to be the caddy of SUV's.  We rode smoothly, comfortably and safely from and to our destination.

The driver has it all right at their fingertips and the passangers have comfort and control of their space as well.  I could go on and on but why?  Do like I did rent one for a day.  Go somewhere fun and see how it is for you.<br><br>
