            When looking for a vehicle that had room for a family of six plus two large dogs, the ability to tow up to an 8000 pound trailer, and then add in wanting 4wd, there were not many options on the market.

We looked at several 1/2-ton vehicles but found that either we would be over the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) or the Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) when we loaded everything up.  So we started looking at the 3/4-ton variety and found that there are only three on the market that met our needs:  Excursion, GMC Yukon XL and Chevrolet Suburban.

At first glance the Excursion seemed perfect for the job.  It had a good reliability record, lots of power and good mileage with the diesel, and tons of room inside.

We started by looking at it in a showroom and found that it had several little nice features that the competition did not offer; small touches of detail in their thought like more cup holders, a hook to hang a trash bag on, power heated mirrors that extend for trailering (which GM didn't add until 2003, but added a power folding ability), etc.

When we took it out for a spin we found the first problems with the vehicle.  The ride was rough just in slow driving and was punishing on the kidneys.  The base level cloth seats were too flat and firm to absorb enough of the impact to spare us the torture.  Other than that, the vehicle was roomy, responsive and quite capable.

When it came time to look at the numbers we figured our little 25' travel trailer would be no sweat.  Think again, we found out.  When we load up the entire family, a few snacks and toys for the kids and the two dogs, we only had 600 lbs payload capacity left over for the trailer tongue weight - and it was nearly 1000 lbs.  So, towing a trailer that only weighed 6500 lbs loaded up, which was 4500 lbs below it's maximum capacity, overloaded the vehicle by almost 400 pounds.  The real culprit was that the vehicle tipped the scales at 7700 pounds before putting anybody in it, because the GVWR of 9200 pounds seemed very high.

If either you tow a trailer and have only about two people and a pet, or you have up to nine people and no trailer, then it would probably be a great vehicle as long as you either replace the seats with more comfortable ones or get the leather interior.
