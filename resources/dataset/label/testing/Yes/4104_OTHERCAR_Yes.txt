            I wanted this car as soon as I heard about it.  The reviews said it was the car that everyone had been telling GM it could build.  I agree.

The handling is super, especially after I replaced the stock Goodyears with some Michelin Pilot HX's.  (Awesome tire for this car) since I had snow tires as well (Toyo Observes, another great tire)  I had opted for the autobahn package, since I was after top notch handling.  The problem is that I got the autobahn brakes.  Big mistake.  They were at the shop every 20k (km's) for turning or replacing.  That was fine until the warranty ran out....Once it did, this car went back...for a 2001 Intrigue.

I had opted for the original 1998 Intrigue GLS, because it came with the 3.8l motor.  I didn't want to try out the 3.5 in it's first year, but I ended up testing the Intrigue in its first year.  There were a number of little things.  No heated seats, the chrome trim over the passenger door keeps coming loose.  The brakes don't last at all (they cancelled the autobahn option.  I wonder why)

I got a good deal, and ended up getting the chrome alloy wheels.  I love those.  The Bose system seems a little punchier than the same system in the newer cars.  The traction control is good, but I like the brake assist on the newer cars.  The self-dimming rear view mirror is a great feature most of the time, and I loved the low end grunt of the 3.8 litre motor.

I got killed on the depreciation when I traded this car in, but I would love to have gotten this car used.  It's a great car, and used it's a super value that is probably overlooked by too many people.  Give it a try for it's sophisticated styling, excellent handling, and strong motor with plenty of features.
