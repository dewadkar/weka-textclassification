            Introduction/European Delivery:

Could you fathom a better place to take delivery of a 2004 330Ci convertible than in its motherland of Germany?  In July I took delivery in Munich (BMW's headquarters) at the factory through the European Tourist Delivery program BMW offers its customers.  The program includes 3 months of insurance, all registration fees and plate fees, vehicle preparation, a free meal at the delivery center, and other incidentals that they go through to get your vehicle ready for the European roads.  Oh yea, shipping back to your dealership and freight insurance is also included.

It was a week of heaven--comfortably cruising for hours at 130 miles/hour, seeing all that Germany has to offer, and taking advantage of all of the nearby cities (Paris, Prague, Salzbourg).  How much EXTRA does this cost, you ask?  You SAVE 7% of the vehicle's cost.  Yes, that's right, it is cheaper than buying a vehicle you pick up in the states.

Many of you may be asking, 'Well is it a German car then?'  And the answer is 'No'.  Essentially you intercept the, vehicle that has been built for the US market, before it gets on the boat to your dealership.  You drive it for as long as you wish, and then return it to one of the numerous shipping offices throughout western Europe.



Now about the car itself:

Performance (9/10):
BMW's slogan is 'The Ultimate Driving Machine', and they live up to this statement.  If you have never driven a BMW, you should.  The power delivery from the 6 cylinder engine is smooth, and it sings in a dulcet manner.  The engine is only rated at 225 horsepower, but the number is only relative.  With the 6-speed manual transmission, there is always plenty of power.  I am sure than the same goes for the automatic, yet I have never experienced it.  

The convertible weighs in at a hefty 3,600 pounds.  That is more than a 6 cylinder 5-series. The extra poundage results from the structural reinforcements, the roll-over protection system, and the automatic convertible top mechanism.  As a result, the convertible is slower to 60 than the sedan and coupe versions, yet is still doesn't have any trouble getting up to speed.  

Handling is an area in which BMWs shine.  This vehicle has crisp steering, great response, and excellent suspension.  I have mine equipped with the sport-package: Sport suspension calibration, 17" M-style allow wheels, wider 245 series tires at the rear, sporty seats with 8-way power, and clear turning signal indicators.  The appearance is significantly enhanced with this package, and I encourage everyone to consider this package.  

Interior (8/10):

The interior is generally well executed save for a few gripes.  The dash layout is very business-like and clean.  There is no clutter--something I appreciate.  Automatic heating/air-conditioning, albeit not dual-zone, is easy to use and effective.  The Harmon-Kardon stereo with one-disc cd is decent but won't blow your friends who drive Lexus (with the Mark Levinson system) away.  It is crisp and has good output, just not phenomenal.  The ease of use is a positive attribute.  It functions very intuitively.

The instrument cluster is classic BMW.  Lighted in a smart orangish-red, the speedometer and tachometer are easy to read and easy to see from the driver's perspective.  There is also a gas gauge (which tends to move a little to quickly from full to empty) and a temperature gauge framing the cluster.  Below the gauges are the LCDs for the onboard computer.  The functions include a miles till next service indicator, door and bulb monitoring, warning lamps (oil, brakes, etc.), average miles per gallon, miles till empty, average miles per hour, clock, and outside temperature reading. Again, the minimalist theme is carried through here.  On the steering wheel are illuminated buttons to control stereo, cell phone, and cruise control functions.  A very handy touch.

Where the interior lacks is the space.  The convertible has very little back seat space when compared to non-convertibles.  The seats, although impressive when compared to other convertibles, is best suited for little people or children.  Adults will complain profusely should they be summoned to the back seats for extended periods of time.  Also, outward visibility is greatly hindered by the massive C-pillars of the soft-top.  Keep the top down and problem solved!

The seats are German-firm.  While they don't coddle you like a lazy boy, they provide good support and keep you firmly in the seat even under race-car like manouevres.  The sport seats have more aggressive bolstering and 8-way power adjustments.  This is the same bucket seat used by Ferrari in the 456GT and other models! The headrests are electrically adjusted as is the adjustment for seatbelt height.  Ingress and digress to the back is as easy as it gets thanks to the seatbelts being integrated into the seat and a high speed button to pull the front seats forward to make room for the person entering.

Exterior (10/10):

The coupe and convertible 3 series models got a mid-model-run refresh for 2004.  This includes new lines, LCD side marker lamps, new front fascia (headlamps, grill, and spoiler), and rear lamp setup including LCD tailights which are adaptive--under harder braking the stoplights illuminate more brightly than under regular braking.  The exterior sprucing is a welcome improvement to an already beautiful exterior.  The vehicle, especially with the top down, has been turning heads since day one.  I opted for Titanium Silver with Gray Leather interior.  The color complements the vehicle's sporting nature and lines well and is easy to maintain.  The silver color doesn't show dust/dirt like my black car does, and it looks very sophisticated.

The optional Xenon-headlamps are amazing.  Not only are they brighter than conventional halogen bulbs, they are adaptive and turn with the car.  On curvy roads they are very handy.  I highly recommend this option.


Cost of ownership (10/10):

BMW includes a 4 year/50,000 miles bumper to bumper warrantee.  Also included for the same duration is BMW's 'Full Scheduled Maintenance' program.  This covers all oil changes and scheduled maintenance and any wear and tear items, even windshield wipers.  However, tires are not included.  Overall, this class leading attribute makes the vehicle very easy to own.

Conclusion:

If a fun, sophisticated vehicle is what you are looking for, look no further.  Top down driving is soothing.  I find myself needing to drive this car at least once a day just because it is so enjoyable.  The automatic top is easy to use and when it is up the top provides great insulation from road noise and weather elements.  I cannot recommend a better use of $45-50,000 dollars for a car!
