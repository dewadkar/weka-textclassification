            The story begins with being a previous Chevrolet Blazer owner.  I wont make that mistake again.
 While trying to trade the Blazer off I test drove alot of other makes of SUVs, but none compared to the 2000 Pathfinder.  I feel in love with this vehicle not even a block down the road from the dealership, on the test drive.  I wanted one, I loved the style, ride,sturdyness,comfortable feel I felt with this automobile.
 In January of this year we were finally able to trade the Chevrolet Blazer off.  I got to take a 2000 Pathfinder home.  The ride of this SUV is so nice, and the stability in the steering is very comforting.  After the Blazer bouncing me all over the road, I was elated with the 2000 Pathfinder.  I have driven this vehicle for 8 months and have had absolutely no problems with it.  I feel secure when I drive it.
  The Dealership in Fort Smith, Arkansas was no slouch either, they have treated me like a customer should be treated. I was in for an oil change and I dont know at the salesmen that ask if there was a problem.  I was happy to say no, just getting the oil changed.  I was in the shop so much with the Blazer. 
I live on a very bumpy, county road and no rattles.  This vehicle is made so well.  It is a shame to compare Nissan to Chevrolet.
 I would recommend this vehicle to any of my loved ones with assurance in my mind.  They would be safer in it than other SUVs. If you dont believe me, try the ride.  You will get hooked.  Lets not the forget the Bose Stereo System in this vehicle.  It is to die for.  I want one for the house..<br><br>
