            We went with the 2001 Nissan Maxima for a few reasons and for the most part, it seems to have been a good choice. This isn't our first Nissan and I don't think it will be our last.

It's v6 222 horsepower engine runs great and easily gets up to speed as needed (no problem there). I've read several reviews on the Maxima's engine and most call it the best V6 available. So far based on my experience I'd have to agree that it is one of the many strong points the car has to offer. It will glue you to your seat when passing and still give a nice smooth ride when just cruising.

The handling in turns may be a little loose, but not enough for it to be a problem for me. It is a very enjoyable ride and I can't wait to take it on a really long road trip.

I'm 6'2" and 250 pounds, so a roomy interior was a big concern when test driving. This car has a very spacious interior and even the back seat was big enough for me to sit in comfort. The sunroof even added an extra inch or two of head room. The power seats are very comfortable and adjust perfectly to accommodate me or my 5'3" wife.

our model came with a nice Bose CD changer system and it sounds great. The steering wheel volume/station controls are a handy feature too.

OK, so far so good. Now what don't I like about our 2001 Nissan Maxima? THE EXTERIOR PAINT IS UNACCEPTABLE!!! It is by far the worst quality paint I have ever seen. I love the color (Merlot), but the paint just comes off like a hot knife slicing through butter. You can almost count on the slightest touch to cause a scratch, chip, and/or gouge in the paint. We've only had the car for a couple few months and already there are dozens of spots where the paint has chipped off. Something you should specifically keep in mind if you lease, because according to their web site, that would be considered excessive wear and tear on the paint and it's only a few months old. I'm almost afraid of what it will look like in three years.

I also own a 97 Nissan truck and our Maxima already has more chips in the paint than the truck that we have been driving for 4 years now. It's been through the same driving conditions, just a far inferior paint job on the Maxima I guess. If you think it's just us, check out www.nissanpaint.com and you'll see there are a lot of other drivers that have had the exact same experience with the Maxmia's paint quality. It's bad enough that a class action suit about the paint wouldn't surprise me at all. It's too bad, because this really is a nice car to drive...That's really the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
