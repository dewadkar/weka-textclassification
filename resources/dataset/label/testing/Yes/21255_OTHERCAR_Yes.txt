            We recently purchased a 2000 Toyota Camry LE and we think it makes a fantastic family car.  About a year ago, my wife drove a Camry as a rental car while her car was being repaired.  After driving the Camry, she immediately wanted one.

We got lots of extras on the new Camry, such as the power moonroof, gold package, value package #3, interior wood package, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and more.  These are the features that we liked the most.  We didn't care much for the factory standard wheels and plastic hub caps, so we insisted on the alloy wheels.  There are many combo packages available with the Toyota Camry (too many to list here) that will probably be available on the 2001 model too.

Our new Camry is fun to drive and we think is roomy and comfortable.  However, on very windy days, the crosswinds experienced during interstate highway driving (65 MPH or more) will tend to keep you on your toes.  Since we usually don't drive very far away from home, this is not a big problem for us.

We used many internet sources before we made our new car purchase.  We highly recommend CarBuyingTips.com.  Everyone should definitely study and review this &quot;entire&quot; site prior to making any new or used car purchase, lease, etc.  CarBuyingTips.com also recommended InvoiceDealers.com, which will help you price various options on your next new car.  You can then use that data at CarBuyingTips.com to see what other people paid for the same vehicle with similar options.  By using CarBuyingTips.com, we purchased our new Camry through CarsDirect.com and LendingTree.com.  Financing was actually provided by PeopleFirst.com.  This was our first major purchase over the internet and we thought our experience with all of the above sites and their contact representatives was excellent.  We saved almost $3200 off MSRP using information from the above sites.

The Toyota Camry is made for five or less passengers.  This car is a fantastic family car, unless your family would exceed five passengers including the driver and everyone wanted to go somewhere in the same vehicle.
