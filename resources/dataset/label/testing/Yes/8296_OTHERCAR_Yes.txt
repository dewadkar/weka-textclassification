            My husband and I recently leased a USED 2003 Toyota Corolla LE.  We also have a 1996 Toyota Corolla.  Before we went to the dealership, we had decided we wanted a Toyota because of the reliability and the value.  We loved our 1996 Toyota Corolla, but wanted two 4 door cars (I used to have a 1995 Acura Integra LS).

Before we went to the dealer, we had decided to either buy a used Camery or a new 2003 Corolla.  When we stumbled on a used 2003 (3 months old, 8,000 miles), we thought we had the best of both worlds.  We decided to get the car.  Here's why:

1)It drove well.  The ride was smooth.  There wasn't quite as much pick up as I was used to, but I was buying a family car now...no more sports coupe.

2)It looked great!  I love the design of the new Toyota Corollas.  I like our 1996 Toyota corolla because it is so reliable and gets great mileage, but I was never very excited by it's exterior design.  I really like the design of the new Corollas though!

3)Gas mileage.  It gets great gas mileage

4)Spacious.  The front and the back seat are surprisingly spacious...even over the older Corollas!  I often sit in the back seat with my infant son and have tons of leg room.  Even my 6' husband says the back seat is roomy.

5)Interior looks great.  The interior looks like a slightly cheaper version of a luxury car.  The dashboard has a sleek design to it and the speedometer and other dials are back lit, so they are easier to read at night. 

6)The trunk is also very spacious.

7) The seats are pretty comfortable...not as good as high-end luxury cars, but good for it's class.

8)Reliability.  We knew we wanted a Toyota (or maybe a Honda).  The reliability record speaks for itself.  This car will last us 10 years.


There are a few bad things that I have noticed.  One I have already mentioned, the car doesn't have as much pick-up as it could.  If you like to drive fast, you might want to think again, but if you don't need to get from 0-60 in 2 seconds (like me) it is certainly adequate.

Also, it took me a little while to get use to the feel of the steering wheel.  It seems a little off.  I can't always get quite comfortable.  I have heard others have this complaint as well.

Lastly, if you have the rear view mirror positioned certain ways, the sun visor bangs on it.  If you put the visor down quickly, you can knock your mirror out of position.  That could be dangerous in heavy traffic.  I did find a position that allows the mirror to just scrape by without hitting the visor.  I even asked the dealer about it and she said that they are all made that way.

Overall, I am satisfied with our 2003 Toyota Corolla LE.  I think we got a good deal.  The car hasn't had a single problem.  I would suggest this car to anyone who needs a cheap, yet very reliable car.  If your budget is a little bigger, I suggest you test drive the Camery as well.
