<TEXT>
            I bought the 2003 Golf GLS exactly 13 days ago. My other car is a 91 VW Fox, so I already know the VW product and obviously like it. I had no doubt that when I get a new car it will be a Golf (the only real competition was the Jetta) so I did very little comparison shopping. I did, however, check out some reviews online that compared cars of the same price & specs, and all of them enforced my decision.

My epinion is written for the average driver who may not know that much about cars (yea, I'm not a professional driver or mechanic, and technical specs about cars just confuse me). I concentrate on the benefits that were important to me. But do keep in mind that I've had my car for less than 2 weeks, so I am still gushing.

<b>OVERALL</b>
The car is compact, and it is a hatchback. People keep referring to it as having a "European" look, which is basically a nice and polite way of saying "damn, that's tiny!". But for a small car it is surprisingly roomy inside. First, it has a pretty high ceiling so it is tall-people friendly. I have a buddy who is over 6 feet tall, and big all around, and he had little trouble getting in or out of the car; his rockabilly hairdo was not even messed up, and that's saying a lot.

The back seats are equipped with 3 head rests and 3 seat belts, but while the leg room is adequate, it certainly isn't plentiful. As for the trunk, the hatchback offers one of the easiest trunks to get stuff in and out of. Furthermore, the back seats can be folded to add more space (you have a choice of either folding just one section of the back seats, so two people could still fit in the seats while the trunk space is expanded; or you could fold in the entire back section for extra room).

The spare and jack are housed under the trunk, but are easily accessible. There is also a cover at the top of the trunk so when it is closed one cannot tell whether the trunk is full or empty (something to think about when you have a hatchback).

The rest of the specs I will discuss separately:

<b>Specs specific to my car</b>
* GLS: The GLS comes with a few extras over the GL, one of which is the sunroof & the alloy wheels. It also includes the possibility of other extras, such as the winter package described below (the GL does not include this option).

* 5-speed manual: I don't like automatic transmission, which is good for me since manual takes about $900 off the price. It's a bit crazy for me to switch to 5 gears after so many years with just 4 (the VW Fox I mention above). The main difference, of course, is that I'm used to the 3rd gear being the top rightmost one so I am periodically putting my Golf in 5th gear when it should be 3rd. The amazing thing is it doesn't stall or whine, it just drives quietly (although I can tell there is a tiny bit of hesitation). The car includes cruise control, and amazingly enough, has an arm rest (not common for automatic transmissions). It drives beautifully and shifts smoothly.

* 4 doors: The Fox has only 2 doors, and unlike American cars, the 2 doors on European designs do not extend all the way to the back of the cabin. Hence, it is not an easy thing to get in or out of the back seats. That is no longer a problem with 4 doors. The locks are, by the way, automatic (they even automatically lock when you start driving, and automatically unlock when you take the key out of the ignition after switching the car off, at which point the lights come on as well). The key thingamabob (ghm, is there a technical name for these things?) is one of the coolest on the market: it includes buttons to lock and unlock the car and trunk, a panic button that sets the alarm, and the key is retractable like a switchblade. Go ahead and find me someone who isn't impressed by that!

* Winter package: Are you ready for this? The front seats are heated (each has its own control), the outside mirrors have defrosters, and the windshield fluid has a heater as well. OK, you still have to sweep the snow off the car (especially when it's a foot or more as we had over xmas) but you don't have to spend much time scraping. You just sit in the car and warm up your rear end (and lower back). I am going to be so sad when my bun warmers will be rendered useless by the months of sunshine and warm weather... This option is actually under $200 extra.

* Monsoon Amplifier: OK, so this not something I was willing to pay for, not even the $350 or so it costs. But we got it for free (the only car that fit the specs we wanted included this, so we did some negotiating...) and I gotta tell you, it is incredible! UNBELIEVABLY clear, and I can't even imagine how loud (if you choose to let it be). An added bonus is that some RW CDs that weren't playing well in my Fox's CD-player (a $100 unit my husband installed a few months back) play flawlessly on the Golf's unit. I believe there are speakers in the back (I think I saw them...) but the balance control only allows to shift balance from side to side (my Fox's controls allowed to shift the balance to just the front or rear speakers as well).

<b>Specs standard in all (new) Golfs</b>
* 6 airbags (or is it 8?): The Fox had none, so any is more than I'm used to. There&#146s front, side, side-top, and possibly side back... I know, this is important, but it's winter and I'm not going outside to count airbags for this review. Sorry, I'm not THAT committed.

* Warranty/ road-side assistance: Not something I can review until I've used it, but from what I can tell I would no longer need AAA if I didn't still have the older VW Fox. The salesman, when showing me the spare tire & jack, said "not that you need to know where it is because with the road-side assistance there is no reason for you to ever change your own tire". Sounds comforting.

* Thoughtful extras:
- power supply in the trunk (for vacuum cleaners or tailgate blenders)
- mats nailed down (OK, so one of my pet peeves is when the floor mats are moved around or folded up, which happens a lot when you drive a manual transmission and have to constantly move your feet)
- dashboard display/lights (such an attractive violet/red display, with dimming options, that I guarantee will impress anyone)
- full size spare (you've seen the commercials, haven't you? Well I tell you, I have the same on the Fox and it surely is nice to be practically the only car out there that can drive on the freeway with a spare just as well as with a regular tire)
- rear windshield washer/wiper (yay!)
- lighted vanity mirrors (hey, I'm a girl, after all...)
- reading lights on both sides of the front and even in the back
- A/C with filter (filters dust and allergy-inducing bad thingies in the air)
- CD/tape deck (impressive when it is standard, don't you think?)
- baby visor over the rear-view mirror (for when the sun is just there and there's nothing you can do, but you gotta check the rear-view mirror to drive safely... amazing nobody had thought of that in the past)

And there's a few other extras, like adjustable seats and steering wheel, power brakes & steering, etc., that I'm not going to go into because my review is getting too long.

<B>Room for Improvement</B>
So what don't I like about this car? So far there's very little. There's the fact that the dashboard does not afford space to keep stuff on it, but I believe that because of the airbags very few dashboards do nowadays. There is less room for the driver's knees than there was in the Fox, but again, that's probably due to the airbags. The glove compartment is also a little low on room, but again, airbags.

So the only real problem I have is the fact that there are only two useful cup holders, but they are the folding type that are sort of flimsy, and they block the stereo when pulled out. The Fox had no cup holders so I really was looking forward to a car full of them... There are 2 cup holders in the door of the glove compartment, but I don't see a scenario where those would be useful. In any case, I bought the car despite this problem and I'm certain that few people will consider the lack of good cup holders a deterrent in view of the benefits listed above.

<B>The Driving Lowdown</B>
Finally, as I mention above, I do not speak the jargon of mechanics, but I will mention what I find great about driving this car. Just remember that I mostly compare it to the VW Fox which is not exactly up to par with modern cars because it's slow and kind of weak.

The Golf is aerodynamic (much more so than the boxy Fox) and handles very well in very high winds (I live in central Illinois, so it's important) even at higher speeds (above 80). It takes corners smoothly (with the VW Fox I had to slow down for every corner, even for some freeway turns) and feels like it's hugging the road (thanks in part to the wide wheels, no doubt).

I have driven sportier cars than my Fox over the years, but with all of them it always took me a little while to get used to handling the car; with the Golf I felt like I already knew how to drive it as soon as I started. And I'm not talking about familiarity with controls, but about the way the car responds to my actions (steering, shifting, braking, etc.).
