            Coming from a background of a middle income family and a father who seemed to know everything about everything, I have had the opportunity to do my share of automotive up-keep.  My first car was a 67'Mustang, second a Honda Civic CRX, and lately a 93' Toyota Celica GT with ALL the features.  

When I bought the car I kept in mind that I didn't need to set aside a entire day every weekend to fix things that broke during the week.  My Celica has been that and more..  Here is a list of things that I've repaired on it without it being typical maintenance:  replaced the clutch, replaced the battery, the CV Boots on the front end, tape deck, and motor in the sun roof.  Please keep in mind, I'm a fast moving 26 year old white male that drives in Atlanta traffic daily.  In other words, I REALLY use the car!  

If I were to have Toyota enhance a couple of things with their cars it would be the durability of the amenities and clutch.  Other than that, it's never left me stranded on the side of the road kicking the tires and cursing.  <br><br>
