                     Let me start off by saying as a whole I don't like Sony products. Okay now i've had this camera forever. (well more like 5+yrs. now) I remember when I first was looking for a digital camera being a novice to the uploading etc. other camera's required I decided that one w/ a floppy would be the way to go. So I went with the FD7 against my feeling's that most Sony stuff is junk! :) This camera is simply awesome it's so easy to use it let's you format the disk, delete, and view the pictures you have taken.

 The pictures are very clean but not crisp. The only problem i've encountered with this camera is the flash, it worked okay for the first year but after that just white pictures whenever used now. I took it to the shop they replaced the flash but it's still messed up and after seeing others I realize this is an across the board problem for the most part. You have to be careful when snapping pictures though as the lighting must be ideal. Outside pictures are always okay but when you inside is when the problem arises. 

  When you want to send a picture of the family to that brother or sister in another state all you have to do is snap it take that floppy out pop it into the floppy drive and insert from the A: drive to the e-mail and your good to go! You can also send it to photo-shop to dress it up to you spec's.

BTW: I'm not sure on the price I paid it was a long time ago..............
