            I( would like to share my recent experiences of buying car tires from a web site.  Specifically, I have bought four sets of tires from The Tire Rack (&quot;tirerack.com&quot;) which is located in South Bend Indiana. This organizations sells virtually all tire brands manufactured for cars, trucks, and SUV's.  The prices are unbeatable when compared to local purchases. Tires can be purchases either unmounted or mounted on wheels/rims which can be bought directly from Tire Rack.  Buying tires already mounted is advantageous for buying snow tires so that installation on the car is simple and inexpensive. The mostly popular method is to simply buy the tires and have them mounted/installed by a local gas station.  Sales people are very knowledgeable and courteous even to those who do not have any technical expertise.  They always recommend several options for your car.  Delivery is directly to your home or where ever designated and usually is within a few days. Prices are provided immediately so that local comparison shopping is a breeze as long as you have specific manufacturer and model number data which is readily supplied by the sales people.  This is really the best way to buy tires.<br><br>
