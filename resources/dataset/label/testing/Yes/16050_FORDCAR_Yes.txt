            This is a great used car for the average person who just wants a cheap car that is great on gas.  It handles nice not that much problems, i have had my 1990 two door escort with a hatch back.  Through the years i had to replace the front tye ride like once, and the coolant temp gauge.  That is pretty good for this year of escort.  I also would recomend this car for a first car for a teenager.  For a teenager this car is small, slow and good on the many miles your teenager will put on!  What I like about this car is how it handles in the sleeck, snow, and ice.  And the way in turns the corners on streets.  Wow the power of an Escort.  <br><br>
