            What a car!!!  When I first got into this car I thought WOW, the features on this merc there are so many.  Having a member of the family work in a Mercedes garage you get to know the mercs, next to the sports model this is by far the best Mercedes ever built.  Just to give you some idea of the gadgets in this machine...
1.  Remote Central Locking with a difference, although Mercedes were one of the first manufactures to incorparate infra-red key start, as an added bonus all you need now is a special key coded card that you place in the top pocket and when you get within close range of the car it will unlock and all you have to do to start the car is nudge the gear stick!
2.  Eco-Mode in steady cruise.  Everybody knows the bigger the engine the more fuel it uses  However the eight cylinder model on the new S-class switches four of the cylinders off when cruising at a steady speed!!!
3.  Cruise Control
4.  ABS
5.  Individual seat settings.
That's just to mention a few.  This car drives like a dream you can't hear the engine, all you here is a low hum.  This veichle is not cheap (well NOT in the UK anyway) so it is for the business user and people with big paychecks.  All in all this car is sweet!!

(disclaimer:  not all of the new S-class come with the things I have mentioned some are extras)<br><br>
