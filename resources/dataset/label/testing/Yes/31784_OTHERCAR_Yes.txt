            I shopped quite a bit for a 3 megapixel camera.  I tried to order an HP 715 but the HP web site wouldn't let me.  I tried to order a Sony 71P but all the web sites were out of stock.  Then one day I stopped at Costco and saw this product.  It seemed good enough so I bought it since it was the last one available.

It has turned out to be a good purchase.  It takes great pictures as opposed to the Sony and it is very easy on batteries as opposed to the HP.  I just wish it were as small as the Sony so I could slip it into my shirt pocket.

The batteries have lasted about 3 weeks so far.  That's about 200 pictures.  If the LCD didn't briefly come on when ever I take a picture they may last even longer.  I need to read the instructions to see if I can disable that.

I have been disappointed at the night pictures so far but I am sure I am doing something wrong.  I hadn't read the instructions which state that you must put it in night mode.  So I'll try that next time.

It takes about 20 high resolution pictures with the standard 16 megabyte memory card.  The upgrade to a 128 megabyte card was $49 so that is a reasonable price for that amount of memory.  Now we can take about 170 pictures at high resolution.
