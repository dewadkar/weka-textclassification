            The 2001 �-Ton Chevy Silverado has the power and the pull that you need if you are hauling a lot or pulling something.

I has the power, it handles great and the new design for the � and 1 Ton pickups are nice. Even though the difference is sight between the � to the � Ton pickups, it is noticeable.

<b>The Engines</b>
Standard in the 2500HD series is a Vortec 6000 V8 SFI - 6.0L with 300 HP. You can order an 8.1-liter Vortec 8100 with 340 HP and a 6.6-liter Duramax 6600 turbo diesel.                           

The price of the Vortec 8100 will add on another $ 850.00 and the Diesel will add on another $ 4810.00 over the standard V8.

<b>Compared with Their � Ton</b>
There are some sight differences in appearance compared to their 1500 (1/2 Ton) series.

First you will notice a slight difference in the front grill, more of a honeycomb look. You will also see the front hood is a little higher against the front fenders.

Now some facts: The � Ton is 78.5 inches wide and the � Ton is 76.7 inches wide. Now different models have different heights, the � Ton heights are 71 to 74.5 inches and the 3/4 Ton heights are 74.5 to 76.2 inches. Final conclusion is the � Ton is slightly wider and the � Ton is about 3 inches taller.

The � Tons have an engine selection that is a little smaller with a V6 - 200 HP, V8 - 270 HP and a V8 - 285 HP.

<b>Payload Compared</b>
I'm not here to put any make or model down, these are the facts as GM shows on a � Ton-Two-Wheel Drive with a 6 � foot bed for all three models.

<i>This is Maximum Payload</i>
Chevy - 3964 pounds
Dodge - 3550 pounds
Ford - 3560 pounds

Four-Wheel drive is around $6000.00 extra depending on which model you get.

<b>Overall</b>
It is a smooth riding powerhouse; it will out ride any small car and most of the medium size cars. Comfort, what can I say it is like being in a car. Power, well hold on here we go, there is plenty of power in the Vortec 6000.

I really like the design and style of the � Ton Chevy pickups for 2001.

I highly recommend you to go look at one and give it a test drive, you will be surprised.

They offer a 3 year or 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and 24 hour roadside assistance.
