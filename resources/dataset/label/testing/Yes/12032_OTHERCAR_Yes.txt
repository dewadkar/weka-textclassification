            I already wrote my little review of the S2000 under the Acura NSX heading, but to recap:

A&gt; I am not a car expert, and I can only judge this car based on having been lucky enough to convince a reviewer for a magazine that he should give me a test ride!

B&gt; This car is fantastic looking... like a Miata on steroids, it has gorgeous, muscular lines and an impeccably finished interior.  The one I saw was red and had people pulling off the road to ask what it was.

C&gt; The engine ROCKS!  Revving up to 9000 rpm, the motor sounds like a jet engine and has more power than the average fighter plane!  The acceleration was insane, and the six speed transmission is really a joke... we never got anywhere near fifth, much less sixth!

D&gt; My skepticism was on the handling.  I have always preferred the handling of German cars, but the S2000 holds on to the road as well as any German import.  We took a hairpin turn at 55mph in 1st gear!  It completely blew me away.

DOWNSIDES:  I am told that they are sold out through 2001!!  Also, this car is not for tall people.  I have relatively long legs, though I am no giant, and my knees were hitting the wheel.  It's a good thing all those hip young starts are short!<br><br>
