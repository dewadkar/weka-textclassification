            So you�re thinking about getting a sport coupe.  Maybe even  *gasp! * a Luxury coupe!  Well if you are considering a luxury coupe, the green must not be a problem, and trust me this coupe is not kind you use with the phrase �affordability.�  Like they say, if you need to ask how much it costs, <i>you can�t afford it any ways!</i>  
       Before you start checking out the competition, take a look at this powerhouse sports car: the 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL600.  If I could describe this car in brief, it would most certainly be known as the epitome of luxury coupes, the king and supreme ruler, if you will.  Now, on to the specifics�

<b>Engine/ Specs</b>
The CL is powered by a 362�hp 5.8 liter V12 which is around 62 horses per liter.  That�s a moderate ratio (Might I remind you that the 2 liter DOHC that powers the s2000 produces 240hp, or 120 per liter) but don�t worry about it, you won�t be able to fell the difference with all of that power, yours to harness and bend to your every whim.  Torque is very strong at 391 lbs-ft and gas mileage is around average for what is expected from a v12: about 15-16 mpg on the streets and 22-23 on the freeway.  Now, on to the real important stuff�

<b>Exterior Styling</b>
The CL600 is one clean head-turner.  If you crave attention and love those stares, this coupe is for you.  Redesigned for 2001, the CL600 sports side skirts, dual chrome-tipped exhaust, and 17-inch racing rims.  The distinctly-Mercedes grill comes complete with an oversized Mercedes emblem, standard with all Mercedes coupes.  A vast improvement, at least to me, is the headlights for the 2001 CL600.  Instead of slapping on E-class lights, the CL600 gets unique, crystal clear, similar-sized dual headlights.  The hood is also more level with less topographic variation from the edge of the hood to the grill.  The taillights are similar to the new S-Class: two clear stripes inside a red triangular frame.  The stance is very strong and aggressive, with a low ground clearance that will make you smile when cruising down the street; and cringe when you hit a speed bump.  Overall, the CL600 has the type of Benz styling that demands your attention, then wins your respect.  It is the symbol of class and suaveness (is that a word?), and if you have no problem flaunting your successfulness, the 2001 CL600 is the prefect way to proclaim it to the world.

<b>Interior</b>
The inside of the Mercedes-Benz CL600 is everything you would expect from a luxury car.  The paneling highlights are walnut and the lining is leather.  A perfect combination, if you ask me.  The control console and gauges are illuminated and fairly easy to read.  The navigation system, COMAND, is also pretty easy to program and use, and really comes in handy when driving through unfamiliar territory.  I can tell you, it had saved me so much time and especially, frustration.  The audio system is on par, and you can adjust both it and the navigation computer with controls mounted on the steering wheel.  I found this function also very handy being the music enthusiast that I am.  You can flip through radio stations without taking your eyes off the road, and trust me, I do an amazing amount of channel surfing: safety <b>and</b> convenience?  Wow!  But nothing in life is perfect and, even though the CL600 has so much going for it, this rule still applies.  First of all, there is a moderate amount of wind noise in the cabin, possibly from the seals on the windows, I�m not quite sure yet.  And even though the radio is easy to use, the CD changer is in the trunk!  The front seats are very comfortable and plush, but the rear seats need more legroom.  During long trips with tall passengers in the back, the drive just gets plain uncomfortable (or so I�m told).  But then again, if you bought a coupe in the first place its not like your <i>obligated</i> to ferry people around!  In conclusion, the cabin of the CL600 is fairly classy.  The only minor problems I could find were the rear seating and inconvenient placement of the CD changer.

<b>Saftey</b> 
 Ok, so you�re cruising down the street in your brand new CL600 and you get decked on the right side by some old gimpy truck.  What is your first reaction?!  If it�s �AHH, my car!� you better wake up!  Ok, so let�s say the car can be fixed but� you�re dead.  Feel any better now?  I didn�t think so.  Luckily the CL600 has a few gadgets and systems to prevent exactly that from happening.  Equipped with six air bags, you will be cushioned (if not suffocated, no I�m just kidding!) in a crash.  If there is no passenger, that side air bag won�t deploy.  And the frame is supposedly super stable or something like that, but I�m really not sure if that will help if you get flattened by some Excursion or Escalade.  


<b>Driving Experience</b>
Ok, now we�re getting to the good part; the most important part of owning a CL600.  That�s right, you guessed it!  Driving Performance!  Some facts: 0-60 in less than 6 seconds, quarter mile around 14.4 seconds.  Impressive?  I think so.  Unfortunately, I haven�t been able to test these numbers myself but I�ve suddenly developed a love for freeway on ramps.  Body roll is pretty much non-existent due to Active Body Control and a low-to-the-ground stance.  The ABC also keeps the suspension tight during hard turns and adjusts it to absorb bumps and road irregularities when just cruising around town.  You gotta love it!  One thing though; the CL600 is an automatic tranny.  Damn!  Even though you can switch to so called �sport� mode the auto still kicks in once in a while and will shift on you when you think you�ve got the gears under your personal control.  Other than that, the CL600�s ride is smooth and powerful.  The revving of the V12 engine begs you to push it harder.  And even though the car might feel heavy at times, the 362-hp 5.8 liter will go through no trouble at all in convincing you that all other cars are standing still (Not that I suggest or in any way support speeding mind you!)  Haha, any ways, to sum it all up, once you drive this car and are able to safely test its real capabilities, you will realize what automobiles were actually made for: pure exhilaration.
