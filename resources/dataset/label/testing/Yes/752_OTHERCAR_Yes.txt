               I have wanted one of the last design (1990-1992) Toronados for a long time. I finally found this one a couple of months ago in great shape. 

   The car handles surprisingly well for its size. The 3800 V6 is quiet and has plenty of power. The transmission shifts smoothly and doesn't slam into gear like some other cars I've driven.

   The interior of the car is very comfortable, with front buckets that literally wrap themselves around you. The dash design is typical late 80's-early 90's GM, a style I call modular, with rectangular boxes stacked upon each other. All controls are within reach and are logically placed. The placement of the seat controls on the armrest of the door is a reminder that this IS an Oldsmobile, I.E. old man's car.

   The exterior design is what initially drew me to the car. Oldsmobile did a great job with the last Toronado. From the nose with the hidden headlights, thin chrome accent strips, and long narrow parking lamps to the back with the full width tail light the Toronado is truly a beautiful and distinctive car. It's a shame that they didn't sell better.
