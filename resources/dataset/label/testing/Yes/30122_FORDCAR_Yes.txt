            I bought my F-150 Supercrew 4X4 with the XLT trim package.  I opted for the optional V-8, with automatic transmission.  I have had the truck for 3 years and it has over 45,000 miles.  I have never had to have any corrective maintenance performed on it.  

What drew me to this model in the first place was the extra large back seat area.  This makes traveling with children much easier.  The truck is equally useful hauling heavy equipment around the jobsite or taking the family on vacation.  The extra power jacks in the back are great for plugging in portable TV's to keep children occupied on long trips.

Some of the other features I like about it are the built in hooks at all four corners in the bed.  The remote holder and sunglass holder in the overhead console are a nice touch also.

As much as I like the truck there are a couple of "inconveniences" as well.  The console between the captain's chairs is not easily accessible while driving.  It takes too much concentration to actually get anything out of it.  The bed length is only 5 1/2 feet, so you do sacrifice some hauling capacity with the extra rear seat area.  Some of the plastic trim work on both the interior and exterior have come loose, more of a nuisance than a serious problem.  When I first bought the truck it took me a little while to learn how to get in without banging my head on the door frame.  I also had trouble banging my knee on the edge of the dash when getting out of it.
