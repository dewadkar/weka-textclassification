            Once upon a time, I was a young, single, well-paid engineer who loved sports cars, my last one being a fully-loaded 90 Turbo Celica that I bought new. Then one day, I got married and had kids and the Celica's Q factor lost out to "practicality". So it got traded for a 97 RAV4L. Why the RAV and not something else? The missus thought that it was "cute". Wht the "L" model? We bought it around the time that Toyota's factory had burnt down and selection was limited. What does the "L" give you? Why, the fancy floor mats with L on them, and a L on the body moldings too! Oh yeah, PDL and PW and A/C come standard on the L.

Anyway, the first noticable sensation of this thing is it's amazing acceleration capability! Ha ha ha ha! Just kidding. Some old lady on the sidewalk with a walker practically blew us away. You can use a sun-dial to measure its 0-60 time. The RAV isn't a dog, it's a dead dog. The next sensation, assuming it ever gets up to speed, is the "Oh my God we're going to tip over" feeling you get as you round a 30 MPH exit at 25 MPH; an exit that I'm used to taking at 90 MPH in my Celica. The sensation is further enhanced by the constant squealing of the Bridgestone tires. The very first thing to do with this car is, replace the damn tires.

Anyway, once you get used to sitting higher and constantly being on the verge of tipping over, and you've accepted the fact that you will never again encounter any amount of G-force in any direction, it's not a bad car. Basically, it's a jacked up AWD Corolla. The engine is the same 2.0L as the turbo celica and mr2 have, sans turbo and power. The AT is a modified version of the electronically controlled AT that came only in the Celica GT-S. The nicest feature of this AT is that when you're going up a long climb on the cruise-control, it downshifts and stays down-shifted until you've crested the hill, rather than up-shifting and slowing down, and then down-shifting again. It has enough ground clearance to do some minor off-roading, and with the AWD and ABS, it's a great snow/ice car. I put Blizzaks on in the winter and have never even come close to being stuck. Even when the road is so icy slick that cars with studs on still can't accelerate without spinning, you can go full-throttle in the RAV without any slip at all.

There is a bit more engine noise than you would expect from a $20K Toyota, but remember, this is really a Corolla. Most of the interior noise comes from the OEM Bridgestone tires, and I can strongly recommend the Dunlop Radial Rovers as replacements.

The ride is a bit firm, comparable to a sports car, stiffer than a Camry, softer that an International Harvester Scout. Curiously, the 4-door RAV comes with only 1 cup holder, while the very cute 2-door comes with 4 cup holders. There's pretty doos storage in the rear with the seats folded down, but not enough room for a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood. There are driver and passenger air-bags, and it also had the side-impact beams in the doors.
