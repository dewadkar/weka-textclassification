            This camera has excellent photo quality and is easy to use.  The self-timer is adjustable to give you plenty of time to get into a family photo after you set up the scene.  When friends have seen the quality of the pictures this camera takes they are always shocked at the price of the camera. The quality looks like those of top end cameras but at a much more affordable price. The zoom feature, auto focus, red eye reduction, time date stamp and auto flash are simple to turn on and off. Hooks to your computer or to the TV for easy viewing.  The software included is fun and easy to use. Uses 4 AA batteries but you can purchase an AC adapter to use while downloading the pictures. Memory card can hold up to 80 pictures. <br><br>
