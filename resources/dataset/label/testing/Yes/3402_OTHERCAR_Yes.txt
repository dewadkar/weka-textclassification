            I am currently the owner of a 1992 3000gt SL.  Originally I purchased this car for purely aesthetic reasons, but I have come to appreciate many more aspects of the vehicle.

First, if you have ever seen the body style of the 1992 3000gt, it is exquisite.  Once you are inside the vehicle, it is created to serve its driver.  The leather power driver seat, can accomodate any position, and any driver.  The gauges are positioned for quick viewing, so your focus does not have to leave the road for long.  The climate control was also a very nice feature, adding to the comfort level of the car.  The power mirrors give the driver good rear and side viewing, and only leave a small blind spot on the driver side of the car, about half way back, but knowing this it can be dealt with.

The electronic suspension gives the driver the option to select either sport or tour mode.  The sport mode allows faster turns and more responsive turning, where as tour delivers more comfort.  One of the few things that I have found unfortunate about this car, is its turning radius, which is not very good.  Although steering around turns, is excellent, the turning radius is far from outstanding.  The only problem that this causes, is in U-Turns, which is definitely something one can live with.

Although the car can handle most everyday cargo needs, the space is limited.  This car is of course a sports car, so space is not the intention, but surprisingly you can get a lot into this vehicle.  On many occasions, I have filled the car to its capacity.  Unlike many sports cars, the 3000gt has a back seat.  More than once I have had people in my back seat.  Although, we did get from one place to another in style, when passengers are in the back seat, comfort level is greatly decreased.  For the most part the car should be a 2 seater, but it is handy to have the back seat for certain special occasions.

Finally, the 6 Cylinder, 3.0 Liter, 222 Horsepower Engine, there is only one thing to say, AMAZING!  This car can really perform, in any driving condition.  Recently I was out of town on business for about 3 months, when I returned and drove my car again, I was amazed.  The power this car can deliver if asked is something to enjoy.

I would definitely suggest this vehicle to anyone who is interested in driving a great looking car, with a great engine, with all the luxury one would like.<br><br>
