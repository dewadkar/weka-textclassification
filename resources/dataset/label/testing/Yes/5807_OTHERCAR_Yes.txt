            Like so many other reviewers, I also spent several weeks researching reviews of digital cameras, and became hopelessly confused by all the choices and options. I had to pull back and re-examine what I wanted to accomplish by getting the camera in the first place.

I had always used 35mm SLR cameras until last year when I bought a Kodak Advantix for its small size and three format capability. However, while I appreciated the convenience, I wasn't completely satisfied with the results. For me, I wanted something that was somewhere between the two.

I finally settled on the Olympus D-490 Zoom because I believe it has, for me, met the criteria I was looking for: It is small and can create excellent pictures.

This is a 2.11 megapixel camera, so it is capable of producing crisp images with vibrant colors. It also has true 3X optical zoom (for the record, it also has digital zoom as well). Battery life is decent, but invest in some rechargable batteries. It only has a serial connection for downloading to your PC, but personally I bought a Sandisk Smartmedia USB reader. It is faster and doesn't put a strain on the batteries. This camera can also output directly to your TV via a video out connection, but you'll want to invest in the optional power adaptor if you are going to use that feature. I also invested in a 16 mb Smartmedia card, since the 8 mb one that comes with it is limited in is storage capacity (you can get about 16 pictures in the &quot;default&quot; HQ setting).

Its least useful feature is the ability to create mini Quicktime movies, though that may be a consideration for some.

I've read some reviews of this camera complaining about the menus.  While I agree the symbols are not necessarily intuitive and do require actually reading the instruction manual, once you know the layout they are just fine.  I think what should be pointed out is that there ARE so many choices.  This allows the casual user to simply &quot;point and shoot&quot;, and the intermediate user to take a bit more control of the process.

In summary, if you have recently been more and more scanning photographs to your PC in order to send them to friends and relatives, a digital camera is made to order for you. If you need prints, a good quality printer (I have an HP722C) along with some photo quality inkjet paper will allow you to get them. That is rather expensive, but think of it this way: you only print what you &quot;really&quot; need.

If you'd like to see some initial test photos, here is the address to a page in my website:

I had to make some changes due to limited WEB space, but you can get an idea of what some of the various quality settings look like.

The Furby HQ photo was originally the default 1600x1200. I resized it to 800x600.  The Furby SQ photo has not been resized. The Furby SHQ has been resized to 800x600.  The Furby SHQ-TIFF has been resized and converted to jpg.

The other photos on my site are scanned in from 5x7 35mm and Advantix prints so you can compare the various results.
