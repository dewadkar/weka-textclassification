               I recently acquired a 2000 Durango. WOW! this is quite a car, or truck, I should call it. This car is basically perfect for almost anyone, assuming you have the cash. Although there are tons of options when buying, and a broad price range depending upon what package you choose, I would suggest saving the extra five thousand bucks a going all out.

   It is in style, not to mention that the the fold away-able third row of seats makes it a perfect family car. I sound system is great, the interior is huge, and with the right package, all leather. It even has a display to tell you the temp, direction, distance of trip in miles and min/hour, and how many miles you can get before having to refuel.

   Which brings me to the one bad part about the Durango, and explains why you need a LOT of cash to own the car. regularly, I get an average of 16 miles per gallon. Put it in four-wheel-drive, and that drops to 8-10 mpg. otherwise, great for anyone!<br><br>
