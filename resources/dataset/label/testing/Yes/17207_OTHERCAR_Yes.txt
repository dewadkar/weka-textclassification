            About a year ago I purchased a 1196 Honda Civic Ex.  The car was already 3 years old and in excellent condition.  I'm not sure if the previous owner took superb care of the car or if the perfect condition of the automobile is due to the quality of Honda vehicles.  Regardless, a year later, my 4-year-old car is still running beautifully and I absolutely adore it.

The Ex model comes fully loaded, so enjoy power steering, locks and windows, a CD player and AM/FM radio, a sunroof and keyless entry.  

My car has a standard transmission which I love.  I tend to get bored driving automatic cars.  For some reason, I feel cars with a stick shift are more powerful too, or at least more entertaining to drive.

I recently took the car in to get a 60,000 mile check-up and the Honda service mechanic told me that I have a wonderful car.  So far it has had no mechanic failures and runs great, so smoothly.  And it has excellent gas mileage.  

The only thing I can complain about is the window wipers.  They seem to streak a lot.  I have heard other Honda owners complain of similar problems.  When you live in an area that constantly rains, this may be of some importance to you.

Apart from the excellent performance, I love the body and color of my car.  With it's sleek, sliver coat, I feel like one hot mama driving down the road.  All jokes aside, I highly recommend this automobile for anyone interested in purchasing a simi-new car.<br><br>
