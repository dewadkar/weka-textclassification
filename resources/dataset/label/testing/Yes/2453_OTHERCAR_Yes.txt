            1st Off:  I'm a bit biased, as I am a Welding Engineer for one of this companies sister plants.  2nd: This is my first written epinion, so give me a break.
I'm a 34 yr. old male with a wife (thank God only 1) and 2 grocery grabbers (kids).  My wife was leary of me buying an extended cab pickup truck, she was worried the kids wouldn't have enough room.  Well, let me tell you, the Double Cab Tacoma has plenty of room!  She was very surprised and pleased when I brought it home.  The 4-doors are great and make it a snap for the 4 of us to load/unload passengers. 
In the spirit of competition, I did test drive some of the competition (Ford Sport Trac: Actual Test Drive) and looked @ the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab.  The Ford had substantial wind noise and I saw many body fit problems in the ones I looked at.  I wasn't impressed with the ride @ all.  The Nissan I didn't even drive.  Although I've read some opinions about the Nissan's looks, I personally hated it.  Looks like a toy to me, but that's just my epinion.
Back to my Tacoma:  I've only had it a short while, but I'm still very pleased, with no complaints.  The gas mileage is better than listed (I'm getting ~22 mpg), wind noise is non-existent, ride is great for a 4X4 with the Off-Road TRD Package, and it's very well put together.  The truck's appearance, while not revolutionary by any means, is very pleasing, with just enough attitude to make it look aggressive, especially with the 16" Rims w/ the large B.F. Goodrich Tires.  I've went over this truck thoroughly looking for defects, and haven't found anything.  If you're looking for a Pickup with a larger back cab, I'd highly recommend looking @ Toyota's Double Cab Tacoma, I've never been more satisfied after buying a new Automobile.
