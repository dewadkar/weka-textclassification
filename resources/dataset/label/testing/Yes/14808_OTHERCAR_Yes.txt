                 <b>S</b>ince the late 1960s, both Ford and General Motors have staged the pony car wars. In 1998 the Pontiac Firebird Formula got a revised engine, titled LS1. This revised engine was kept in the Forumla until the Firebirds demise in 2002, which during its time furthered its power over its rival; the mustang GT.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

       <b>T</b>he big and torquey 5.7 liter LS1 V8 engine can overpower the Firebird at times, but it has relatively good handling with an overabundance of oversteer, if promted. The meaty goodyear tires provide tremendous grip and big stabilizer bars keep body roll to a minimum. Handling could have been improved here, compared to the Mustang GT the Firebirds/Camaros seem extremely large, disabling the fun factor that could have been produced on twisty roads.


<b>Acceleration</b> is awesome, the Formula is lighter than the Trans Am, and can sprint to 60 MPH in just over 5 seconds (according to specs)! Some people have even got these cars to go even faster without any modifications whatsoever. Acceleration also comes extremely refined for an OHV design. My only grip with performance would be the somewhat unrefined 6-speed transmission. While this transmission provides good shifts, it seems a bit clunky compared to many other cars, i.e. the Toyota Celica.  
   
<b>Info about this all American OHV engine:</b> The LS1 engine, like its LT1 predecessor retains two valves per cylinder and a pushrod design, but everything else is, including the all-alloy block new. This engine features distributorless ignition, 6 bolt main bearing caps, .500 inch lift cam shaft, and symmetrical intake and exhaust ports. (Who said OHV engine could not be high tech?)
 In standard trim, this LS1 Cranks out an advertised 305hp and 325lb ft of torque. Although, these cars on horse power dyno's, have dynoed up to 345 flywheel horsepower! All this power is matched with either a 6-speed manual, or a 4-speed  fully automatic transmission. I recommend the 6-speed.   

   The 1999 Firebird relies on a monocoque chassis. The front <b>suspension</b> has been changed after 1992 from  Macpherson struts to unequal length wishbones, although at the rear there is still a salisbury live axle suspended by coil springs, and with a panhard rod and torque arm to aid traction. Four-wheel vented disc brakes are standard equipment on all Formula Firebirds.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the Firebird is a lot like its brother, the Camaro. It does have supportive seats, but the 1999 Mustang GT's are much more supportive. There is plenty of front leg and head room, but the back is cramped. The leather looks rich, but it feels plasticy, and speaking of plastic, plastic makes up most of the interior. The Plastic here also feels very cheap, GM obviously did some cost cutting to keep the price of the Formula down taking it out on most notably on the interior. Visibility is somewhat poor, and the drivers position isn't up to par. There are enough amenities, but ergonomics are not as well thought out as the competition's. 


<i>Interior Innovation:</i>

The engine goes together perfectly with the <b>exterior</b>, which screams 'American Muscle.' Not only is the Formula  more aggressive looking than the GT Mustang, it can boast one of the most aggressive designs in the world.  And if the formula is not aggressive enough for you, there is the Trans Am WS6 which comes with Ram Air hood scoops to intensify this aggressive theme.

    The Firebird Formula and the Mustang GT both are great cars, and both offer more bang for your buck than any other car on this planet. New, the 1999 Firebird Formula went for as little as $22,000, can you name a new import that can do 0-60 in less than 5.2 seconds for under $30,000? I can't. Today, a 1999 can be had for around 16-$19,000; not bad.

 These cars have been very reliable according to almost all owner whom I talked to. The owner of this '99 Formula has had no problems with his. 

<i>Conclusion:</i>


The 1999 Formula offers intense power, but lacks refinement in many other categories. I do recommend this car, however I do question the material integrity of the interior.
