            Although I never saw myself as a minivan owner, I have loved every minute of driving my Chevy Venture.  It drives like a car, but has seating for the whole family and some friends.  I bought this van after starting a childcare business, and I drive around 6 children comfortably.  They all loved the automatic door!  However, the automatic door is supposed to stop when something gets in the way, but it requires quite a bit of force to stop the door from closing.  You have to make sure no little hands or feet are in the way.  I've had the van for 5 months now, and haven't had any problems with it at all.  Anyone looking for a vehicle suitable for families will love this van.  There are plenty of seats, and you can also fold them up or take them out to make way for luggage, toys, etc.  I highly recommend this minivan to anyone.<br><br>
