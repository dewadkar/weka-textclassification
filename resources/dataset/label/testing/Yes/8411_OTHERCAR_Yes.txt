            This camera is fantastic - we just upgraded from an earlier edition of a digital camera (Olympus 600L), and couldn't be happier with our decision.

I work for a large construction company, and part of my job is to take progress photos monthly of each job under construction.  The high resolution of this camera allows perfect photos to be sent to owners and architects, and we can even use them in printed brochures.  They do NOT look like digital photos!  

The Olympus 2000 is very versatile - allows for several resolution settings that are easy to select and change, 3x zoom capability, uses SmartMedia cards up to 32 mg (which allows for up to 64 pictures on one small disk), and even an infrared remote control so that you can set up your camera on a tripod.  

It's very easy to download your photographs onto your computer and then you are able to manipulate them through the software provided with the camera.  You can even take several views of a subject and then &quot;stitch&quot; the photographs together to make a panoramic view.   You view your photos through a 1.8&quot; color LCD panel, which is larger than those on earlier versions of this camera.  There is also a built-in automatic flash, and you can adjust for &quot;red-eye&quot; exposure.

I found this camera very easy to use.  However, some of our project managers that don't have photography experience found it a little difficult to understand.  They preferred the Olympus 620L, which offered fewer decisions for them to make!<br><br>
