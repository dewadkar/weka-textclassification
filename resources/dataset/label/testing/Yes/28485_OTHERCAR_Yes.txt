            This is an update to my original review!

I now have 33,000 miles on the vehicle I am basically happy but the mileage is still only 18 mpg with mostly 45-65 mph driving with almost no stop and go! I do live at 6,000 feet, but my old pickup that weighed a ton more (literally) got 16.5.

There are several service bulletins for the Envoy so if you are having these problems bring it to your dealer!

Headlight wiring melted.

Passenger seatbelt locks

Drivers mirror goes spastic point to the sky!

Vehicle will not start totally dead.

I also just had some clips on the drivers side door break so the inside panel moves quite a bit.

I am also getting a clunk in the right front side when turning all the way and hitting a bump.  Such as making a U turn and then going over a curb.

I am sure the dealer will take care of these but it is a pain


The 2002 Envoy from GMC is a new from the ground up vehicle, it shares the basic components with the Chevy trailblazer and the Olds Bravada.  For those who are wondering the Buick Rendezvous is a Pontiac Aztek!

The Chevy is a pretty ugly vehicle while the Olds is going away and resale value could be in question, also it is limited in options.

I purchased a SLT model with heated leather seats, the AM/FM/CD/Cassette, Sunroof Chrome wheels and Running Boards!

The Running Boards and wheels came on the vehicle if you have the option or are thinking about getting them skip it!

The Chrome wheels in my opinion don't look as good as the standard ones and the running boards are so thin as too be pretty much useless!  The vehicle is not that tall that it needs running boards as a step in!

The good stuff  Climate control works great cools the vehicle quickly and the driver  and passenger can have a 20 degree difference in temperature.  rear seat passengers have 3 fan speeds and get their temp from the passenger!

Heated seats have and option for back or seat heat and 3 levels of heat!

Radio works well the steering wheel controls work well once you learn them, I was just really used to reaching for the knob now it is push a button!

The CD and Cassette areas on the radio do get VERY warm I have had no problems but I did hear of one person who had a problem with home burned CDs if you burn your own a lot take one with you on your test drive!

The ability to customize most of the features on this car are its greatest strengths!

You can have it Lock the doors when you put the car in drive or reach 8 mph or not at all.

Unlock the doors when the car is in Park or when the key is removed or not at all, and drivers side or all!

Handy for those bad neighborhoods

Have the headlights stay on after you get out of the car for 10-20-30 seconds or not at all.

The list goes on and on............

Virtually every feature can be customized or turned off!

The engine and transmission work well the engine could have used a 5 speed but the system does work the engine has plenty of power (I have the 3.73 axle) and the transmission will do a 4th to 2nd downshift no problem.

Gas mileage at 300 miles of mixed highway and city traffic is 16.4.

The seats are very comfortable and have enough adjustments so anyone should be comfortable. The sunroof works well and has the usual features.

The headlights work very well both on low and high beam, the foglights can be turned on without the low beam headlights if you  need them!

The rear seats fold flat for large objects, however if you have the front seats back near the end the back seats cannot fold! also the rear console leave a circular mark on the middle of the seat due to the tight fit!

rear hatch works well and the glass can be lifted separate if you just need to drop something in or want to let the hot air out.

Ride and handling are OK it is no sports car and I came from a pickup so the ride noise and smoothness are an improvement for me!  I do notice some wind noise either from the doors or the mirrors at about 75 MPH ( I take a toll road to work every day). The car seems to be able to coast forever, coming off the highway I am used to just coasting thru the automatic toll booth then stopping at the end, from 70 MPH I have to brake the Envoy because at the toll booth I am still doing 70 as compared to about 50 in my truck!  I don't  know if it is aerodynamics or just less rolling resistance!

The brakes seem to have a lot of travel and not much feel from 60 or so there seems to be a lot of pedal travel before you get braking, just different from other cars!

Windshield wipers have the usual delay setting and slow and fast, fast doesn't seem to be that fast in a heavy rain.

Overall I am very happy with my vehicle make sure you do some good comparison shopping with other SUVs and compare features that mean something to you!  Folks in Florida could care less about heated seats they want AC that works!

Check online for prices and options.

I looked at the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander.

The Toyota had everything an option side airbags etc..
Plus it has limited towing capacity. The Ford lost out is styling and cost about 1K more with fewer features.

One thing I didn't mention is the OnStar System, the car comes with the basic plan lock unlock doors etc.. free for one year, this service can also help recover your vehicle and should save some $$ on your insurance.  The sound quality for the service is very good and the people are very helpful!
