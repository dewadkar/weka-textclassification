            The Taurus vehicles have had a long-standing standard of excellence.  It is no wonder they have been rated a five star vehicle in its class for so long!  The Taurus is built for people who want the look of excellence and sophistication and luxury they deserve!  I�m a single woman who loves her Taurus!  I bought my first Taurus in April of 1996 because I loved the look and features.  Also, I have a good friend who is a Ford mechanic.  He has seen all of the Ford cars and had only good things to say about the Taurus. He recommended this car because of its safety features and low mechanical rate problems.  (This car has not had a single manufacturer recall.)

I love driving the Taurus.  It drives easily and has the power to pick up and go when I jump onto the freeways.  I put about five hundred miles on my car per week and I have not had a single mechanical problem!!! (Knock on wood)

By sheer bad luck I have been in two serious accidents in my Taurus cars.  The first was totaled when an individual ran a red light and struck the side of my car head on at 45mph. My second Taurus was just in an accident in November when a kid lost control on the wet roads, came left of center, and hit me on the front driver�s side.  Both times I walked out unharmed!  I attribute my lack of luck to fate, but give the credit to Ford for designing a vehicle that would protect its passengers in all accidents both serious and minor.

P.S.  Buyer Beware!!!  Once the Taurus�s features spoil you, you�ll swear you can�t go back to anything less!  I can�t imagine driving in any other vehicle.
