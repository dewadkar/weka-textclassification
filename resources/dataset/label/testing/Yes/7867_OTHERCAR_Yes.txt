            My third BMW is a 2001 330CIC Convertible.  A stunning automobile in silver with a Merlot-colored interior that turns heads with WOWS...

This is a Consumer Reports suggested vehicle for starters.  So highly recommended that it earns high marks for both new and used.  My first BMW at just $5,500 was just as stunning and exciting as my $55,000 2001 330CIC!  Price means nothing and getting into any BMW old or new means you'll have a vehicle that will take you for the ride...

Acceleration is quick/fast/sure.  Steering is so precise that it often feels like you're on a rail and not really driving until you notice that in fact it is you holding that wheel.  A slight movement of that steering wheel and in a breath you'll move the vehicle with total ease.

The automated cloth top is quick and responsive and for 2001, BMW has added a GLASS (instead of plastic) window insert saving you near $500 in plastic replacement every two years.

Brakes are so touchy that it actually becomes a challenge if you own more than one vehicle and switch back and forth.  Just a touch on the pedal and you're stopped.

One weakness is BMW's AM-FM CD stereo system.  Bad quality sound, weak station signal holding ratio and just not user-friendly.  Okay, so that's the only negative!

Paint finish is European quality with a gloss and thickness maybe only second to Porsche.  Plastics are German and so-so but that's not what this car is all about.  Japan still ranks as best in overall quality for fittings and integrity but there isn't a car from Japan that could even come close to this kind of handling and style.

BMW.  Building machines like no other car maker.  Performance second to none.  Solid, clean and excellent fuel consumption for such handling.  

Whether you're looking for a 330CIC or a 325 or 328, I guarantee you a love affair.  Promise!
