            I bought this vehicle because my previous car was the all-reliable 1991 civic cx hb 5 speed.  My first car and naturally I was in love with it.  

I find that at highway cruising speed the car is incredibly smooth and solid.  Although the ride may be a little firm on side roads, I like that.  It gives the car a bit of a German feel.  Handling is good for a sedan, but my accord is a 98 EX with 34000Km (Canadian eh!) and the shocks have very slightly softened up now on sharp turns.  Handling is still very good though.  
I engine has adequate power for a four cylinder, but it is a little noisy and whines a lot slow speeds.  It is not as quiet as the Camry.  (The accord V6 is very quiet in comparison).  At highway speeds the automatic is great and keeps the RPM's low for great quiet cruising.  At 100KPH I am doing about 2200 RPM's.  Not bad and enough for sudden passing.  As I mentioned power is adequate.  I get up hills, pass on the highway without problem.  If road rage occurs and I floor it, it does take off well.  It is not a sports car like take off though.  If you want that and cant afford the V6, make sure you get the coupe in a 5 speed.  But still, the auto 4 cyl. Vtec is great and will accelerate willingly.  You may have to put up with a little bit of engine noise, but it is not an annoying sound and acceleration is smooth.  
I don't like, I mean I hate the auto at low speeds.  If you are going over speed bumps and speed up and slow down, expect the transmission to gear hunt a lot at low RPMs.  As I go over a bump and begin to speed up the transmission accelerates smoothly for a second or two, and then suddenly shifts down with a bit of a kick, and then I slow down again so it downshifts.  This is very annoying.  It even happens in slow moving traffic.  It seems the auto is a little touchy.  If you push the gas very lightly you can avoid this sometimes.  
I got the black accord with leather.  The leather is light gray.  Its ok but I wish it came in black leather like the v6 coupe.  I think it looks better.
The doors are very flimsy.  As one rests his or her hand on the side arm rests on the door, you can hear the plastic creak.  When the power window comes down the inside of the door actually bulges as the window begins to go down.  My uncle has the V6 model in 1999 and itï¿½s the same.  Minor but enough to raise an eyebrow.
The rubber seals on the sunroof dry very quickly and creak every time I go over a bump.
Repairs wise, no problems in 2 years.  The brakes do squeak now when applied lightly.  It is quite loud.  Honda says I have 55% left in the front and its just dust.  Braking ability is excellent though.  The brakes have a very good controlled feel to them.

Overall I really like the car.  The ergonomics are great.  I like the instruments, nice and big and logically placed.  The seats are not bad, a little firm and not very luxurious feeling; I mean compared to a Merc or BMW.  The leather is I am sad to say not the best quality.  It is thin and you can tell it is mass-produced and there just for the sake of being called leather.  It looks nice though and does not look cheap.  

I would buy this car again.  The problems are actually all minor, except for the automatic tranny, but even given its shortcomings the car feels amazing and is reliable.  For the extra bucks the V6 is worth it.  The four cylinder does not give the greatest fuel economy anyway.  I have a 60 liter tank and I get about 550 KM, all highway.  Not bad but have you seen the price at the pump lately... ouch.  Remember, it is quieter, very powerful, and you can get black leather!
