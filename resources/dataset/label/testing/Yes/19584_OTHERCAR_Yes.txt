            OK!  So my user name shows my bias, but how can I help it?  I've driven/owned many cars and trucks and even currently own a Land Rover Discovery ('98) that my wife drives.  With my two kids and two dogs, there is nothing that matches the Suburban for comfort, size and convenience.  There are three primary things that any SUV/Van can be designed to accommodate (people, cargo or towing capacity).  Every other vehicle on the road forces the owner to decide which one is most important.  The Suburban achieves all three at the same time!  And it does so with a massive gas tank (44 gal.) for long distance rides (DC to Atlanta, non stop) and a Cadillac quality ride.

Make no mistake, ignore the Chevy vs. Ford battles and go out a drive a Suburban.  You should come to the same conclusion I did.<br><br>
