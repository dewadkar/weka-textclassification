            I�ve been driving my Grand Vitara for two months now and I love it. Granted, I�ve been driving a no-frills Mazda pickup for the last three years, so I may be easy to impress, but I really enjoy driving my new SUV. I�ve never actually enjoyed driving before, but I�m so comfortable in this car that I almost look forward to driving. Here�s what I really love about my Grand Vitara:

<b>The visibility is excellent.</b> At only 5 feet tall, I find this a very significant feature. I can finally see completely over the steering wheel and the dash board! (Don�t laugh, this has always been a real problem!) The seat�s nice and high (but there�s <i>plenty</i> of headroom for tall people), the steering wheel is adjustable, I can reach the gas pedal without being crammed against the steering wheel, and the windows and the rear-view mirrors are huge. I did take off the back seat headrests for better rear visibility, but with that minor modification I can see anywhere I need to with no problem. 

<b>It�s a great ride.</b> With a V-6 engine it has plenty of power, it handles really well, and doesn�t feel at all tippy. According to a <i>Car and Driver</i>Web article, �the new V-6 generates 20 more horsepower than the Sidekick's most powerful engine, a 1.8-liter four-banger.� There�s the fan hum that�s noticeable in most SUVs, but I rarely notice it. The seats are comfortable, there�s plenty of room in the back seat (which folds down quite easily), there are several storage spaces (between the seats, inside the doors, and even drawers under the seats), and nothing important is out of reach. Plus, it looks good. It�s compact, but more sophisticated looking than the RAV4. It comes in a nice assortment of colors: Silky Silver, Midnight Black, Polar White, Mars Red, Baltic Blue, Grove Green (the color I picked), and Planet Gold.

Then there are all the standard bells and whistles:

<b>Cruise control</b>
<b>Dual airbags</b>
<b>Tilt steering wheel </b>
<b>Power locks and windows</b>
<b>Air conditioning (pollen-filtering system) </b>
<b>Rear defrosters and wipers</b>
<b>Remote keyless entry</b>


My only real complaint is gas mileage, but I guess that�s to be expected with an SUV. Suzuki claims the Grand Vitara gets 21 miles on the highway and 19 in the city, but it seems even worse than that. If it weren�t for this factor, I�d give this vehicle 5 stars. If I could, though, I�d give it 4.5.
