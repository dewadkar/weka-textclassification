            I purchased my Accord in February 2003.

SUMMARY:  Based on owning this car for 1 year and driving it 15,000 miles...I definitely recommend it to anyone considering a car in this class.

PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS (SUBJECTIVE):  This American built Accord probably has the best balance of performance, quality, style, and value of all cars in its class.  It's not quite up to the level of (near impeccable) quality Toyota has achieved, but I would definitely choose the Accord over the current Camry or Solara (or even Celica) based on its other attributes.

THINGS I LIKE:  ****Smooth, quiet, and POWERFUL V-6 engine.  ****Ergonomic interior design and styling, which have made 100-mile commutes much more bearable (and even pleasant).  ****Impressive craftsmanship in leather upholstery.  ****Center control console for environmental controls and radio; good job!

PROBLEMS/THINGS I DISLIKE:  ****Warped brake rotor(s) (do a search on Google for 2003 Accord warped rotors).  This appears to be a common problem for the Accord.  The dealer had the insolence to blame my driving style for this problem, then turn around and say they were doing me a favor by resurfacing my rotors.  My 2001 Solara's brakes have yet to warp despite similar driving conditions!  Toyota still beats Honda in engineering.  ****Not quite perfect fit and finish.  See below.  ****"Feel" of paint job.  I'm sure the paint job is very durable; however, I'm used to Toyota's "thick" feeling painted surfaces.  Hondas have always felt like tin cans to me and the paint job on this Accord "felt" rather thin.  In all fairness, this Accord has spent many months under the scorching sun and sand blasts in the Mojave desert.  It has held up very well.  **** Inconsistent Honda service.  It was a coin toss on whether I received good service or not.  Overall, I would say service was "ok" comparable to service at Best Buy.

FIT/FINISH PROBLEMS:  1)  Plastic door sill on drivers side popped out when I first received the car.  I pushed it back and haven't had a problem since that time.  2)  Annoying squeak from center console next to the shifter.  You will also find this as a common problem using a Google search.  The console will produce a constant high pitched squeak when the car vibrates at just the right frequency (during highway driving, of course).  I suspect it is due to a rubber seal rubbing against the plastic console.  I added one drop of lubricant and have not heard another squeak.  3)  Broken visor clip.  Passenger side.  4)  Rear passenger side mud guard nearly fell off due to poor installation.  The mud guard had already lost one screw and was on the verge of falling off when I noticed the problem.

I listed the problems I experienced after one year so you can have an idea of what you MAY experience if you buy this car.  However, you should keep things in perspective since these were rather minor problems (except the brake rotor...more of an annoyance than safety problem right now).  Other models will have their share of problems.

OVERALL SATISFACTION:  VERY SATISFIED.  I sometimes wish for a longer commute so I could drive it just a little longer.

PRICE:  $24,400 including mud guard, wheel locks, spoiler, cargo net, and all other charges except tax.
