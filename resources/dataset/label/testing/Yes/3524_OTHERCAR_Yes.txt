            Being only the second digital camera I have ever used, I'm going to say that HP315 is a pretty nice little camera.  It is best made for whoever wants to take some nice quality pictures and is willing to take a step forward with the technology.  It is relatively small, smaller than the SLR models and is not heavy at all. The photo quality is great, much better other similar cameras (that are in the same price range)
It has 2.1 megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular, fine, or superfine mode.  Naturally, superfine requires more memory on the 8 MB card, only allowing you to take a total of 10 superfine photos before you download them onto your computer.  In regular mode,you can take up to 50.  
There is a 1.8 inch color screen on the back of the camera, allowing you to view and select photos for deletion or downloading.  To take pictures you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the LCD and look through that.  Using the LCD does however drain the battery rather quickly, so I try to avoid it unless I want to view already taken pictures.  
The HP315 does have a 2.5 digital zoom.  However, to take pictures using the zoom is a bit difficult. You have to turn on the LCD to do this, draining battery.  However, it does help to produce beautiful shots.  
Overall, I would say that this is a great little camera.  It has a nice weight, is easy to operate and has handy little rubber grips on it so that you don't drop it.  If you have the money, you should look into it!<br><br>
