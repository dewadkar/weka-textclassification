            In January of 2000 I bought a 2000 Impala LS (luxury sport).  This sophisticated vehicle comes with a leather ergonomic interior, sunroof,  and full contoured electronic seats to name some of the pampered amenities. 

It is a worthy successor in the long line of Chevy Impalas.  It handles the road well and yet gives the driver all the creature comforts one would expect to find in a luxury vehicle.  

The interior is quite spacious, I am 6'3&quot; and have more than enough room to relax and stretch.  Additionally, the trunk could easily accommodate an unwanted in-law or a pair of skis when the back seat is folded to the down position. 

The car gets about 20 miles per gallon on the freeway, so it is not the most full efficient of cars, but I still feel this is a small price to pay for the handling and feel of the vehicle on the road.

The safety features of the car are excellent.  There are rear child safety locks and driver and passenger air bags in the front, and another side airbag for the driver.

All in all I think Chevy has outdone itself, and has continued the driving excellence of the Impala.<br><br>
