            I absolutely love the Panasonic Lumix digital camera. I have never in my life seen a camera produce such professional quality pictures. I have used my Lumix in just about every light condition possible, even in the rain! Its amazing clarity will leave you wanting to take more and more pictures. 

The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC40 is an amazing little piece of equipment. It offers a 3.0 mega pixel picture quality and even a 30 second video capture capability with sound. The best thing about digital cameras is that you no longer need to purchase film. A small memory stick will do the trick. The Lumix comes supplied with an 8 megabyte memory stick which is capable of holding up to 45 pictures. You can purchase higher megabyte cards to hold even more pictures. The Lumix has an LCD screen on the back so that you may view your picture as soon as you take it. If you don't like it, you can just delete it!

With the Lumix LCD screen you get an on screen menu full of options. You can delete one or all of your pictures from your memory stick, you can protect your pictures so they don't become deleted. You can even set up a slide show with or without the use of audio and change the duration of each slide from 1 to 5 seconds each. Lumix lets you add an audio dub to your pictures and even lets you resize, trip or format them right there on your camera. 

You can set your Lumix to take the best quality pictures by changing the environmental option. Such as indoors, or out. Taking pictures at sporting events, up close pictures of nature, taking pictures of family and friends to eliminate red eye, and even taking pictures when the exterior light is not just right. 

There is so much you can do with this Panasonic Lumix. The possibilities are endless. Such as with the 3 times zoom, you can get up close and personal with your subject. Although I feel that when zooming in from far away the Lumix zoom power is lacking. 

When purchasing the Lumix, you get the camera itself which also has the lens changing capabilities for when you want a larger zoom. You get a USB adapter cable to connect to your computer. You also get a CDROM from Panasonic that offers a picture placement and organization program and of course you get the instruction manual available in many different languages. 

All in all, this is an excellent camera. I am a firm believer that when it comes to digital cameras that you get what you pay for. The Lumix is worth every bit of it.

I purchased my Lumix from my local Military BX for U.S.$459.00 but I believe you can order these on line plus newer versions from panasonic.com. Also for first hand views of what this camera can do, (not sure if I can do this) but check out my personal website which is listed on my member profile. Promise, no selling of anything! Just pictures of castles and the family.
