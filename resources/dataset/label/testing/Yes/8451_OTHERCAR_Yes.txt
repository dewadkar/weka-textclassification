            I have had a Canon Sure Shot that has taken hundreds of beautiful photos for the past 10+ years but everything gets old. It has been having a few problems here and there and recently the focus was starting to look like it could use a pair of bifocals! (That's what happens to us older items). I have been getting my photos on CD and on-line through PhotoWorks.com. They turn the photos around very quickly and you can get them on-line for all of your far-off family and friends - but that is another review maybe. Anyway, the old camera was giving up the ship and I REALLY, REALLY wanted to buy the new Olympus 3040. I decided that now was the time.
Down to the store we went. Actually, off to three stores before we finally found one where there were semi-intelligent life-forms to answer questions from a not quite intelligent life-form. It is imperative that the person selling the stuff be knowledgeable when the purchaser isn't.
I had my mind made up after comparison shopping on the net that the 3040 was my camera! I intended to buy one after I was able to find out what a few of the things that I was comparing really meant to a non-professional photographer.
I compared a couple of other models for feel, weight, disk insertion, and cost of options. After the sales person explained the advantages of the 3040 over the other items he explained that he had a 3030 for $100 less and as far as I could tell there wasn't much of an advantage. I figured that with the $100 savings of the 3030 over the 3040, I'd be able to buy extra batteries and the SmartCard.
As happy as I was to finally have a digital camera, it didn't compare to being able to print photos for anyone who wanted them. (See my review of my HP-970Cse printer) What a combo!
Don't even act like you would like to have a copy of any of my photos - I can make a copy for you, for your dog, for your car whatever! I can make calendars, snapshots, posters, wallets, etc. and etc. When I bought the camera I was expecting to get some pretty good photos for use on my website and to e-mail to some friends but I did not really expect to get photos that would look good out of my printer. Believe me when I tell you that I get near photographic quality! This is a super camera.
I have always wanted to have a camera that needed filters. With this one, it's not necessary! If I want the photo a little more blue I adjust it. If I want the photo brighter, I adjust it! If I want to remove that ugly kid next door, poof - he's out of there! The joy of the digital age!
I have three regrets with this camera. The first one is that I spent about $200 on developing the film from our last vacation and I still have about 20 rolls of the replacement film that came with the developing. That $200 would have purchased another couple of the BIG disks! My second regret is that I'm not able to connect my laptop to the camera so I will have to be sure to take several disks on my next vacation. And my final regret, I really like dealing with PhotoWorks.com. They have lots of my photos stored on-line for me. I have the CD's here at home but they are really nice people and if everyone gets an Olympus 3030, who will be there to take care of my other photos?

In answer to my question/title, I didn't know about Epinions.com before I bought it!
