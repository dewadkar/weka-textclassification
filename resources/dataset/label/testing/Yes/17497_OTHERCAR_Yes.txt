            I remember telling my husband that there was absolutely NO way on earth I would ever be &quot;caught dead&quot; driving a minivan. I am now eating my words.

We decided to look at minivans when we were expecting our second child and had &quot;outgrown&quot; our car. I had heard good things about Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth minivans and I preferred the body style of them over any others. Being a stubborn wife, I insisted we look at these types of minivans first. 

We went to look at them and I have to admit, I was hooked! All that room! I also loved the integrated child safety seats. We were constantly struggling to try to make our car seat fit properly in our car and with the integrated seats, that would no longer be a problem. I got behind the wheel and told the car salesman, &quot;I cannot believe I am behind the wheel of a minivan!!!! He laughed and replied that if he had a dollar for every woman or man that said that, he could retire. We were off for a test drive. I loved it and wanted to take it home right then and there. I was impressed with the handling overall. I liked everything right down to the seats and the fact you could remove the third bench seat if needed (which we did for extra room). We are fans of Consumer Reports magazine and liked what they had to say about these minivans as well. 

We looked around at several dealerships and ended up leasing a Plymouth Voyager SE (or something like that) I can't say enough about this van. To date, and knock on wood, we have never had a problem with it. We even get pretty decent gas mileage!  My only complaint is that we did not get the Plymouth Grand Voyager so we could have a bigger van with a bit more room, but since we are leasing, it is highly probable we will get another one of these minivans (Dodge or Chrysler as I hear they will no longer be making Plymouth) and get the larger, or Grand, version. I highly recommend this van to anyone with children or anyone who needs a lot of room, comfort and reliability at a decent sticker price.
