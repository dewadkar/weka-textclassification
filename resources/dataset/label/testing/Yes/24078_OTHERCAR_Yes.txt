            While there are better digital cameras out there, the Relisys Dimera 3500 isn't bad, and for the price, it does everything it's supposed to do. Of course, there are plenty of features digital photographers may need that the Dimera 3500 just can't deliver due to its budget-priced nature, such as an LCD viewscreen, advanced image filtering, etc. Basically, this would be a nice entry-level camera for the beginner, for taking casual snapshots, taking simple pics for websites or to provide images of your auction goods for eBay. Simple to use, the Dimera 3500 also takes advantage of NexFlash Technologies MediaStik Serial Flash Memory Modules, available in 2MB &amp; 4MB varieties. It includes 1 2MB module, and since these are easily interchangeable, it provides endless expandability. With true 640x480 resolution, built-in electronic flash, an easy to use software package &amp; relatively cheap memory, you could do worse. 

Please note: The AC adaptor is a must. While the batteries may do for taking snapshots, it sucks them dry very quickly when uploading to your computer.<br><br>
