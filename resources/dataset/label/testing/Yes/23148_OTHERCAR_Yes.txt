            I was looking for a car to drive that was reasonable on gas &amp; 4-wd. I seen this car at a dealership, test drove it. 
I feel in love with the color coordination &amp; looks.
 Someone had ordered it but did not care for it. Lucky me! 
I am still getting 32 miles to the gallon. It has had regular maintenance done.
 In the summer it's nice. I can take the soft top off &amp; enjoy the summer breeze.In the winter it heats up fast. 
The only thing I don't care for is the velcro that holds the back window. It has lost the stickiness. Easy to replace though. I do have problems with the soft top, trying to find a good cleaner for it. 
If you have a tendency to swerve to avoid things, this is not the vehicle for you.
 This vehicle handles very well &amp; the ride is not as bad as I was told it would be. 
The 4-wd allowed me to climb a snow hill that a jeep wrangler could not pull. I have a 5-speed transmission which allows the vehicle to have more power as far as hill climbing. 
I live in Virginia so there are plenty of &quot;hills&quot; to climb.
 I am now looking for a new tracker to purchase.<br><br>
