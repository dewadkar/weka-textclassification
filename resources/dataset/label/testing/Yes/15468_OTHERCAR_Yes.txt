            This is an excellent camera in general.  It is easy to use and takes high-quality, high-resolution pictures.  It is simple to use, especially for someone familiar with conventional cameras and video cameras.  It is simple to review and erase images when necessary.  Another advantage is that images are stored on conventional 1.44 Mb floppy disks.  This makes transfer to a PC an easy procedure that does not require any special equipment or cables.  I think that this emphasizes the greatest advantage of digital cameras - images that can be printed or manipulated immediately without any time for development.  Unfortunately, the storage capacity of these disks limits you to 5-7 images per disk under normal conditions.  Of course, when pictures are saved at the highest resolution, this further reduces the number that can be stored on a single disk.  

As mentioned above, images that are captured are of a very high quality (though still not equal to those taken with a high-quality still camera).  I have noticed, however, that the camera tends to highlight greens and blues, especially in outdoors shots.  Also, as with other digital cameras that I have used, it takes several seconds for the camera to boot up and to store images; thus, this would not be a good camera for taking pictures in quick succession (such as at sporting events, wildlife, etc.).  Despite these limitations, I highly recommend this camera.<br><br>
