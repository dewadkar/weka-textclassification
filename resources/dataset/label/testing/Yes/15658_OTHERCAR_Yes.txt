            It made me sick to see the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail price on this baby.  I'd like to know where they sell it for $850!  While the camera itself is a dream - At $1,000.00, I found it way overpriced at the local CompUSA.  The camera takes excellent pictures both for the novice in a point and shoot mode, and the professional who likes to &quot;tinker&quot; with all those gadgets the average Joe knows nothing about.  We have made a couple of MPG movies and the quality of them is unmatched.  The camera does all the thinking for you, so you need not worry about the quality of the pictures you take - you can rest easy knowing that when you click that button, you just captured a quality image.  I haven't really tried any accessories with it, but I will say that it does not come with a camera bag, and the store I purchased the camera from did carry camera bags, but none would fit this particular model.  They did include a handy Sony catalog, so when I save enough money, I can order it from the manufacturer.<br><br>
