            Being a retailer who happens to sell this model, I've tried it out a couple of times and found it very easy to use... I had no trouble with the menus as other people have mentioned. If you have patience and take time to do a little reading, you should have no problems; digital cameras are not something you can just pick up and jump into. I highly recommend that you have some photo knowledge as well as some computer knowledge.
I did however run into a little difficulty downloading to my computer, there's an issue with USB drivers and Windows '98 and since this is an earlier model, their software and it's capabilities are not as great as they are now.... most of their newer models are now auto-connect USB which is much less traumatic! I admit the whole thing almost went out the window on my first try!
By all means though, do not be discouraged by this, as I say this being an earlier model (soon to be replaced) it has it's glitches but on the brighter side, there is a downloading help sheet I believe is available on their web-site which you will find very useful.
Don't be too concerned with battery power either, you can purchase rechargeable "AA" battery packs, lithium batteries, floppy adapters or card readers that connect directly to your computer so you can by-pass camera power all together.
As far as picture quality, I've used this camera for fun as well as on a professional shoot and the images are flawless. The benefit of seeing your work on the spot and being able to delete and re-shoot un-satisfactory shots is extremely helpful and efficient.
One side note to this and all digital cameras speaking from a photographic point of view; if you're buying a digital camera strictly to e-mail photos, you don't have to go "mega-pixel" crazy!, most e-mail only accomodates small files which the 1.3 mega-pixel cameras offer, 2.1 generally gives you 4x6 or sometimes 5x7 reproduction quality and 3.3 and up give you 8x10 and beyond. But being a "traditional" photographer, if you want images you can enlarge, stick to old faithful 35mm, while I am impressed with the abilities of digital and it's continuous leaps and bounds, I am still very partial to my old 35!
For you computer and gadget junkies out there though, this and all of Olympus' offerings are a great addition to your collection, trust me!! I think Olympus makes the most user-friendly products out there, which is good because if you try to get through to their customer service line you better hope you have a lot of spare time on your hands!!
