            After several months of anticipation I finally picked up my new Ranger pickup in July.

I'm in the military so I ordered my truck through Military Car Sales and had it built the way I wanted it.

I have owned a Ford Explorer for four years and liked the quality of Ford products. I did shop the other brands but wasn't impressed the styling and features of the others (or the price).

My Ranger is a 2003 XLT, regular cab, short bed, 2-wheel drive, with the 4-cylinder engine and 5-speed stick. I upgraded with the XLT package (A/C & stereo/CD) and chrome 7-spoke wheels, and added a factory bed liner and Zeibart undercoating. It is Dark Green with Tan/black cloth interior and it looks great!

By going with the 4-cylinder stick I was aiming for the best possible gas mileage and still have a truck capable of hauling anything from the home improvement store and still not break my wallet on the fuel cost of commuting. So far it has averaged 29mpg.

The fit and finish of the vehicle is first rate. It has a comfortable ride and handles quite well. As with any small truck the rear end tends to hop around on rough roads but is not a problem.

I am thoroughly impressed with the load carrying capability of this truck. Within 24 hours of bringing it home from the dealer I had a full load of 2x4 lumber in it and the suspension hardly squatted at all. Later I hauled sixteen sheets of 1/2-inch drywall with the same results. This truck seems to haul the same load as the older full size 1/2-ton pickups.

The truck it quite "zippy" enough but slows noticeably with the A/C on (but not to the point of being doggish). By the way the A/C works wonderfully and I have to keep turning it up because it works "too" well at times.

The factory AM/FM Stereo (single) CD with 4 speakers works extremely well with a full range of sound.

With options the truck was price at @ $16,600 but I got $4,500 in factory rebates so I payed @ $12,100 for it. I wanted an inexpensive truck that looked good, got good mileage, and could haul a respectable load, and thats exactly what I got with the 2003 Ford Ranger.
