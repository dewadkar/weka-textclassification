            I admit, my orignal opinion praised this car too much. But what can you blame me, I absolutely <b>love</b> my car<i>!</i>

I've been driving 1992 Infiniti G20 for quite some time now. Some people complain about the engine noise at high speeds. But what they don't understand is the excitement the noise brings to the driver. The engine noise doesn't sound at all like a normal combustion engine. It sounds like a jet! And while cruising at those high speeds, with the jet-like noise echoing throughout the cabin, one almost slips through the gates of heaven, entering a state of pure bliss. It's quite a wonderful engine sound. Infiniti thought of everything. If the engine had to make noise, why not make it a noise worth listening to? And it makes it sound much more aggressive than its meager 2.0 liter 140hp actually is.

I guess the powerful jet-like roar of this car is a tradeoff you get with the performance the G20 provides. I have the leather and convenience package, which included an automatic transmission. The automatic takes a lot of power away from this wonderful engine. I find myself having to push the car to get it to perform at the level I want it to go. There is also a big jerk as the car downshifts to get the speed you want. This is not uncommon with cars featuring computer controlled engines, but when comparing it to other cars of similar design, the jerk is a lot harsher. The car had a lot of trouble pulling its weight when going up a hill. It slows down by twenty-five miles an hour. You can counter this by turning the overdrive off, but you're only limited to 60 mph unless you want to damage the engine by going faster with the overdrive off. But hey, that great engine sound will make you feel faster than you're actually going<i>!</i>

Besides the joyous engine sound created at high speeds, the G20 also has many great features that are proudly displayed in it's luxury image. Leather seats, power everything, glorious sound system, etc. etc. The controls for the radio, airconditioning, hazard lights, rear-defroster, etc. are placed neatly in the center. This control area is slightly angled towards the driver so its extremely easy to press what ever button you're going to press. At night, everything is lit up in such a way that it doesn't bother the driver, but is quite eloquent.

Some things that I was kind of erked about was the fact that it did not have any cup holders. Driving with a cup between my legs was not great when I had to quickly hit the breaks; which, in turn, made me squeeze the cup, leading the the inevitable spillage of its contents all over my legs. Also, the cruise control on switch is in a hard spot to press. Not on the steering wheel.

Overall though, the car is very fun to drive. It has wonderful handling, with great ease as it quickly and precisely executes everything the driver wishes to be done. The car really pampers the driver, making him/her feel like a high-class aristocratic noble. I encourage everyone to test drive the Infiniti G20, and experience its glory. Be warned, once you enter the divine confines of this majestic car, you may never wish to leave again. And always remember, &quot;Own one and you'll understand&quot;.<br><br>
