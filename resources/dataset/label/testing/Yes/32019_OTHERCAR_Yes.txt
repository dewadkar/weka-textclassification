            <b>The cars we compared</b>
When we decided to buy our new near luxury car (we could NOT afford a Lexus), we spent months checking out all the vehicles on our "wish list".  We test drove all of them, checked them out on Consumer Reports, spoke to individuals who owned these models, etc.  We were well informed when we went shopping.  The cars we were comparing were:  Toyota Avalon, Nissan Maxima, Pontiac Bonneville, Olds Aurora, and the Buick Regal.  The Regal is the car in whose commercials Tiger Woods appears.  My mother in law owns a Regal and it has been a very reliable car for her.

<b>Buick Regal Models and Options</b>
The model we test drove was the Supercharged 3800 V6 Engine, with 240 Horsepower.  Quite a peppy car to say the least.  Also very comfortable leather seats, with seat warmers (a must for me living in Alaska!!).  Very roomy front seats and more than normal room in the rear seats.  The trunk is spacious, with a generous 16.7 cubic feet of space for stowing luggage or groceries.

The car is a little bigger than the Avalon, measuring 196.2 inches in length (this was going to be tight in our small garage).  The exterior colors are: White, Silver Metallic, Sandrift Metallic, Gold Metallic, Jasper Green Pearl, Midnight Blue Pearl, Bordeaux Red Pearl, Graphite Metallic, Black, and Storm Gray Metallic.  Interior colors are:
Medium Gray Leather, Taupe Leather, Graphite Leather, Medium Gray Cloth, Taupe Cloth, Graphite Cloth.  The GS has 15" wheels, and 16" are optional on the GS and LS.  

Options include power sliding roof, dual automatic comfort temperature (lets both front passengers vary their inside temperatures by 5 degrees), 8-speaker audio sound system, steering wheel audio controls, and heated leather seats.  There is a fold down armrest in the middle of the back seat, and fold down seats for entrance into the trunk of the car.  The dash is very standard looking, with everything within easy reach.  Cruise control, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and a theft deterrent system add to the package.

<b>Safety Features</b>
Four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, traction control, driver side-impact air bags along with dual front air bags, a tire inflation monitor that lets you know when tire pressures are not equal (nice for getting the most mileage out of your tires), and an air filtration system.  The Buick's all come with Onstar Safety plans, the first year is free.  This is something we were not interested in.

<b>Comfort and Handling</b>
This car is quiet and smooth.   The automatic transmission shifts very smoothly.  Wind noise on the highway is noticeable, so it's not what I call a "hushed" car, but it is not bad.  I felt the Nissan Maxima handled better than this car, although for short drivers the Regal did give a good view of the road.  The leather seats were very comfortable, and the heated seat control had variable temperatures.  It did not have the lumbar support for the driver that the Maxima has.

<b>Warranty</b>
Standard three years of 36,000 miles.  This was the same warranty that Nissan and Toyota had.

<b>Price</b>
The sticker price on the car we looked at was a high $29500.  The dealer was not willing to negotiate to our satisfaction, and that was the main reason why we didn't buy this car.  The Nissan dealer came down to just $400 over his cost.

<b>Reliability and Gas Mileage</b>
The American made cars are starting to catch up with the foreign cars for their reliability.  Consumer Reports does not have the Regal on their "recommended" list, but the later models from 1998 on seem to rate quite well as far as problem areas go.  It is supposed to get 20-29 MPG on highway driving, falling short of the Maxima which gets up to 33 MPG.  The supercharged model requires premium fuel, another draw back.

If you don't mind spending more on fuel, and getting slightly below average mileage AND you can make a good deal with the Buick dealer, this is one nice car.  We didn't choose it because of price and the other reasons I listed in this review.
