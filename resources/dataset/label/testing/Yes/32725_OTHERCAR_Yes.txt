            Oh my God!!  What an awesome driving experience this car was...I loved my Mazda 626.  5 speed, 6 cyclinder, sport tires and suspension...It made getting into that car one of the highlights of my day....I loved driving it anywhere, all the time.....The seats were comfortable, the cd player/sound system was awesome.....Get in, open the sunroom, roll down the windows and take off.  It would impress you on a flat stretch of road just as much as it did on a curve filled country road.  Many times I got in my Mazda just to go driving for the fun and excitement of it.  I do believe that of all the cars I have owned, this one was the most fun to drive and the one that I miss the most.  Lightweight, sport suspension to handles those high speed curves, excellent acceleration and a modern body style all with a VERY affordable price tag.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is wanting a sports car and doesn't want to pay the insurance rates and high payments associated with one.  It's da bomb!!!  I had mine for 3 years and never had one problem at all!!<br><br>
