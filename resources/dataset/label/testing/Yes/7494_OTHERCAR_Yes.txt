            We purchased a 2000 Dodge Stratus last August and have been extremely pleased -- and surprised -- with this vehicle.  At first, we were hesitant about buying an American car (we owned an Audi prior to this car), but the fact that the Germans had taken over Chrysler really won us over.  And now that we have owned the car for almost one year, I can tell you that whatever the Germans did, they got it right!

First of all, it is a rather roomy car.  From the outside, it may look like a mid-sized vehicle, but inside, we have plenty of leg space (and my husband is 6 feet tall).  However, I don't think the back seats may be quite as roomy.  The trunk space, however, is also quite generous.  We have room for our daughter's stroller and all 8-10 bags of our groceries, with room to spare.

Personally, I believe all the components of the dashboard are aligned in such a position so that it is the most convenient for the driver.  It is easy to change the radio station, adjust the air temperature, etc. when driving.  And the adjustable seats (in various angles) help drivers of all sizes (I'm about 5 feet 4 inches, and both my husband and I can find comfortable driving positions.)

The car is also well suited for child car seats.  There are slots to attach the tethers on a convertible car seat, which we found to be very convenient.  These slots ensure that the car seat is securely fastened and that our daughter is as safe as possible.

The Chrysler roadside assistance package is reliable as well.  When we locked our keys in the car the other day, we called the service, told them what happened, and the customer service person (after getting all the information) told us someone would be there to lock us out in about one hour.  When we told them we had a hungry baby with us (it was 8:30 p.m.), she informed that to the local tow truck operator, who promptly arrived at the scene within 15 minutes.  Needless to say, we were very happy with the service.

But, the most surprising aspect of this car is its ride, which is extremely smooth and comfortable.  A few months ago, we were in a car accident (side note: other driver's fault) and we had to get a rental for a few weeks.  The rental agent determined that since we had a &quot;mid-sized&quot; car, we should get a rental that is a mid-sized as well.  Let me tell you -- the ride was completely out of the Stratus' league.  Our rental car also was an American-made car, but the ride was awful when compared with the Stratus.  In fact, before we got the Stratus, we had a nice, full-sized Audi 100, and the Stratus' ride actually compares better with the Audi -- no kidding.  The smooth and comfortable ride is what really made us big fans of our car.

I don't think it should be surprising if you start to see more Dodge and Chrysler cars on the road in the near future, because I believe the company has really turned around and are now producing some top-of-the-line vehicles for their class.  I would definitely recommend test driving one of their vehicles (why not even a Stratus?) before making your next purchase.<br><br>
