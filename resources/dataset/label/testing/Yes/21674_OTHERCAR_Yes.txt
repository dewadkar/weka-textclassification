            I am totally satisfied with the Toyota 4Runner.  Ours is a 1994 model, I believe.  It runs like a Toyota has the reputation of running.  My only complaint is that the cassette player won't keep a cassette inside it.  And we're currently looking for another used one that works good, but the size of it is hard to find.  It also needs rear air, not just heat.  Now I don't know if all cars do this or not, but the head rests are removable and that is so helpful when you're sitting in the back seat and can't see anything in front of you!  The Cruise control is also kinda noisy when going uphill and it takes awhile for it to switch gears.  But besides all that, I really do like our Toyota 4Runner.<br><br>
