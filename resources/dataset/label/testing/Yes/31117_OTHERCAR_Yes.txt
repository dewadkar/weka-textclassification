            I have a 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4X4 5-speed.  I love my car.  My husband wants to get rid of it because of medical problems that we can't drive it well but i will not get rid of my Jeep.

Engine:
4.0L runs well.  Had to replace the battery, alternator, distributor cap and rotor, and had the crankshaft sensor replaced.  They have been simple wear and tear things on a Jeep that has almost 100,00 miles.  Other than that i have had no problems.  We now have to get the muffler fixed but that is a $20 part and a day fixing it.

Interior:
We covered out seats because they were an ugly gray color.  It is small but can fit 3 car seats in the back if necessary.  The drink holder keeps falling off but since i have a stick-shift it makes it difficult to drink while driving.  The trunk is nice except for the tire in the back but i like the fact the seat folds down.  

Exterior: 
The paint is fine.  We get scratches every now again because of neighbors.  We have a roof rack that we haven't used because we have enough room in inside.

Gas Mileage:
We get great gas mileage for being an SUV.  I think it has an 18 gal tank but it costs $25.00 for a fill up and i get almost 300 miles per tank.  I actually get over 350 miles on long road trips.  When we got the crankshaft sensor replaced and the oil changed we were getting over 300 miles per tank.  

4X4 Feature:
I love it. HEHE.  WE live in a town housing development where they pile the snow up high at the end of our cul-de-sack.  We were they only ones able to get in and out of the parking space for a month.  We can go on the beach with it and even helped get out a stuck 2X4 Ford Explorer.  


2 things i wish I had were a towing package and newer tires.  It kills tires fast.

The stick-shift is what sold me on the vehicle.  I wanted an SUV(My husband and I are quite tall) that was a 5-speed and had 4X4 capabilities(husband loves to go off road.)
