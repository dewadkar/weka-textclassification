            I originally bought my suburban to fit my children, and the rest of the carpool i drive to school, but i fell in love with the roomy, safe, and powerful Suburban.  It can haul our boat, and fit all my surfboards, and still looks nice, and is so comfortable inside.  My teenagers have no problem driving it, and they feel safe in it.  It also fits the 7 children I drive to school each day, and it still has enough pickup on the engine to drive on the fast lane on any freeway.  The suburban rides great, and is so useful that it pays for the gas that it eats.  So, overall the Suburban is one of the best large SUV's if you want to transport people, equipment, or anything for that matter.<br><br>
