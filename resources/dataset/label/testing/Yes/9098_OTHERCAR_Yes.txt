            	What can be said about the Kia Sportage that hasn't been said already?  I bought my Sportage in '98 and have been reasonably happy with it ever since.  I've taken it off road into several types of terrains and weather conditions, and it performed well on all occasions save one: the beach.
	Aside from getting stuck in deep sand (which most vehicles will, I might add) this vehicle is a great buy.  You can't beat the ability to have small-car handling on the road and mid-size truck handling off the road.  The Sportage does have a few problems, though.
	The biggest issue I take with the Sportage is the lack of acceleration.  I realize that trucks as a rule don't get sports car handling 'off the line,' but it would be nice to do 0-60 in a little less than 12 seconds.  
	Most people view the Sportage as a 'wannabe' sport utility, but I'm always the first to step up and prove it otherwise.  I have taken friends and family off-roading in my Kia, and usually have them leaving the experience fairly impressed.  One good thing about driving a cheaper sport utility is that you aren't as worried about dings or scratches than if you had paid twice or three times as much for a 'real' sport utility.
	All that being said, I would recommend the Sportage to anyone who wants a little bit of excitement off road without the great expense of a leather-bound, overpriced truck.  I have never had any serious problems with mine, and haven't talked with anyone who has.  It's just too bad the dealers don't give test drives off road, for they would surely sell a lot more Sportages if they did.<br><br>
