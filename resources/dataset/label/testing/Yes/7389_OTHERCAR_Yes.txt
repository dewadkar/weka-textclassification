            If you, like me, are looking for a performance sedan that is well-made, has power that throws you against the back of your seat, and handles like a race car, you've had several choices in the past, all of which were expensive. Whether you've driven and S4, a 330xi, or others, you've recently had to spend $35,000 or more to get a car that fits..

Well, not any more. Subaru now makes a Rally-based version of their Impreza sedan & wagon known as the WRX. While not pretty, it will make any current Audi or BMW owner a little uncomfortable with how well its performance compares to their pricier models.

The exterior styling leaves much to be desired, and has been extensively discussed. It's boxy, and the additional cladding on the WRX looks almost Pontiac-esque, which is definitely not a positive. Yes, there's some cachet to the ugly-duckling feel of the entire Subaru line, but they're clearly attempting to reach into a different market, where buyers have many choices. Like it or not, looks are important to many buyers. Word is that Subaru is revising the design for future releases, so we should see some improvement here shortly.

When you first settle in to the cockpit, you'll immediately be greeted by the race-car feel of the WRX. It comes with a aluminum petals, closely placed for the heel-toe driver. Race inspired steering wheel, short-throw shifter, and comfortable, confining seats all contribute to the sense that this car wants you to test its limits.

On the down side, some of the non-performance controls & gauges are either hard to read, or hard to reach. Try looking at the clock when driving - or rather, don't. It's fruitless, and likely dangerous of you're searching for it while driving this car like it wants you to.  Same for the cup-holders: where did they dream these up ? 

The real value of the WRX, though, shows up when you turn the key and start driving. Subaru has a long history in the World Rally Championship series, where souped-up sedans race in time trials over every kind of road throughout the world. It's obvious that they have taken lessons learned from that experience and built them into this car. The powerplant is efficient, and more than adequate. Its 2.0 litre turbo four cranks out 227 bhp, somewhat less than the more expensive S4 for example, but powerful enough to give you a jolt when you mash the pedal. Turbo lag is negligible at mid- to high-RPM levels. All in all, this engine perfoms comparably to the S4, but not as well as the supremely efficient BMW motor in the 330 line. Nothing to be embarassed about there, though - everyone else's engines bow to the Bimmer.

The combination of AWD and beefy suspension make this car a joy to drive. Some understeer is noticeable, but not unduly problematic. Steering is precise, and the WRX will hold the road unless you do something idiotic. 

Other than the styling, the only possible complaint from their apparent target market is the lack of available luxury options. You won't find many of the standard Audi, BMW features on the WRX, even if you were willing to pay for them. So no heated seats, etc on your WRX. The good news, though, is that you'll pay $15K less for a car that is comparable in every performance category, so you'll feel far superior to your S4- and 330-driving friends.

Have fun !
