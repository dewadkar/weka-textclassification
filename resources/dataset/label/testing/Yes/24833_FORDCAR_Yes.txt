            My next door neighbor just recently purchased a black 2000 mustang for just under $20,000.  I never would have expected the car to perform as well as it has.  Not only is it extremely fast, it is as smooth as butter!  I can be quite honest when I say that this car is well worth it.  There has been a lot of talk that the mustang does not handle well in the snow or on slippery surfaces.  This may be true with the 98's or 99's models but the 2000 is totally different.  It has the feature &quot;traction control,&quot; which somehow brings the wheels farther apart as it begins to slide.  I would recommend this car to anyone who has a need for speed and likes good quality cars.  <br><br>
