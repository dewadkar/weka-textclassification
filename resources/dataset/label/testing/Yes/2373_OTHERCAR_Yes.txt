            Nissan Maximas will always have a place in my heart, because I learned to drive on one.  Yes, some call me spoiled, but hey, I liked it. :)
Anyways, my dad had a 92 Maxima.  He was continually trying to tell me to watch my speed, because I would accelerate and not realize how fast I was going (Switching between my dad's maxima, and my mom's little toyota was a bit of a chore).
I loved driving the car.  It was quick (As I've mentioned), it was comfortable inside, the drive was nice, the radio was good...  All in all, I would love to have that car again (Even if it is 8 or 9 years old now).. I'm seriously considering buying a new Maxima this year as well, based on my previous experience.<br><br>
