            I have owned my 2001 RAM Air Trans Am since November of 2000. I'm not a salesman, but I have to say, if I were going to sell a car, this is truly the one I would recommend. This car is a serious vehicle for a serious driver. I wouldn't recommend this vehicle for a younger driver as it holds a lot of power and perhaps a few too many opportunities to let the engine out of it's cage. If you are a younger driver, the Firebird still shares the same body styling minus the RAM Air hood. The Firebird is still a decent 200 horse power engine. For the experienced enthusiast, the RAM Air TA is truly a machine worth owning. Essentially the WS6 is the only way to go - with a 325 horsepower engine - which is the same engine the Chevy Corvette wields. You'll find yourself saving over $15,000 vs. the Vette - essentially the same car with a different body style. A style that I have seen countless heads turn for. I was in my hometown driving in the winter. I was at a stop sign on the opposite side of the road of the local Police. I saw both of the officers look at the car and say to each other, "What in the hell is that?" I've also seen many others say the same. I've had countless people tell me how awesome my car is. One review of this car says not an everyday car for an everyday driver. Why is that may I ask? It gets 28 miles per gallon on the highway. Boo hoo, my 98 Honda Accord got 31 mpg. If your going buy a car, why park it in the driveway? My only complain about this car is that the panic button on the remote entry system is a little sensitive and touchy. Other than that, this car is THE perfect vehicle. This car was meant for excitement. I can only suggest you take it for a test drive to see what the excitement is all about.
