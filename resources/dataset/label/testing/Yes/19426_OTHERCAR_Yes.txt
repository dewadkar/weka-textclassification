            The vehicle was purchased in May 99 for our growing family of four.  The CR-V is worth the money compared to other SUV's in its class.  The Honda name is synonymous for quality workmanship.   We bought this car because of our history with a previous Honda, 14 years old, minimal repairs,very reliable. The ride is smooth and comfy for long trips. The acceleration is great, the engine is dead quiet.   The gas mileage is pretty darned impressive, 25 in town, and 33 on the freeway. My wife loves the 6 cup holders which are standard. The down side, the front passenger seat does not come with a standard arm rest, we were cheap and did not fork over the extra 250 dollars and now my wife's arm is left dangling down and she tends to start leaning onto mine.   The back seat comes with an armrest in the center, kind of crazy, who uses it? We like the built in picnic table that is in the trunk, comes in handy for tailgate party's, camping and diaper changes.  We recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a reliable, fun, compact SUV whose front seat passenger may have an amputated left arm.<br><br>
