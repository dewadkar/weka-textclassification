            UPDATE March 25, 2000, I wanted to give this information out to anyone who has one of the following vehicles, I received notification in the mail about this.

SAFETY RECALL TO INSPECT THE WIRING IN YOUR MINIVAN'S AIRBAG SYSTEM AMD REPAIR IT IF NECESSARY
1994 AND 1995 model year Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan and Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager Minivans

The problem is: The wiring that initiates the driver and/or passenger airbag on your minivan may electrically short circuit to ground. A short circuit to ground that exists immediately after turning the ignition key to &quot;On&quot; or &quot;Start&quot; position can cause the airbag(s) to inadvertently deploy. 

It goes on to say that you can take your vehicle to the dealer and they will fix it for free of charge, if the problem exists. They will perform the test for you to find out if there is a problem. 

If you have trouble getting your vehicle inspected or repaired, please call the DaimlerChrysler customer assistance center at 1-800-992-1997

My husband and I traded in our 96 Corsica for this van when we added another member to the family.  We bought it used in 97 with about 30000 miles on it.  
 When we first purchased it we had a few problems with the transmission.  We found out later that they had problems on that particular make and model year Grand Voyager.  We still had the car under an extended warranty and the dealership changed the transmission with only a 50 dollar charge to us.
 My husband is in the military and we have to travel a lot and wanted a vehicle that would get good gas mileage and be roomy enough and comfortable enough for traveling and had a little pickup to it.  This van came with a 3.1 liter V-6 engine and a 16 gallon gas tank.  We average in the city about 270 miles to the tank and on the freeway about 360 to the tank.  So the drive from Arizona to Washington was very cost efficient and comfortable.  I expected to pay a little more for gas on the trip up; but was surprised that we didn't for such a large vehicle.  
What I like most about this vehicle is the power that it provides the driver.  If I hate anything about this vehicle it's the back seats.  You can remove the back seats to leave it open or just have one seat in the back. But the seats are heavy and hard to take out of the van(I'm glad to see that they put rollers on the new van seats).  
 I now have a little over 90000 miles on my van; and have in the 3 years that I have owned it replaced the brakes, serpentine belt, cooling fan, and your general yearly tune-up maintenance on it.  I feel that this van was a very good purchase for the money that I paid for it and the little maintenance that I have had to put into it.  
I would recommend this vehicle to just about anyone that wants a dependable vehicle and doesn't want to have to put it into the shop every time they sneeze. I would not hesitate to buy this vehicle again.<br><br>
