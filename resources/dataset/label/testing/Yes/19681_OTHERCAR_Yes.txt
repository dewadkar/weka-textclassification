            The Saturn SL is a great family car which also has the ability to make you feel young and carefree again. With a kick to it when you step on the gas and a smooth ride whether you're running errands in town or travelling cross country, this car is more than worth its economical price. More importantly, due to Saturn's numerous safety features, insurance companies tend to charge less to insure it, and I can be assured that my family and myself are well-protected.  To top it all off, the process of buying my Saturn was virtually painless due to the helpfulness of the staff.  If I had to do it all over again, this is the car I would buy.<br><br>
