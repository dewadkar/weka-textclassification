            I just recently went and bought a 2000 Avalon and it is the most awesome car I have ever owned.  It has a whole new design (making it look somewhat similiar to a mercedes) and the quality and comfort and convenience in this car continues to improve and impress me.  Toyota definately has created a car that competes with it's own Lexus division.  The Avalon provides as much if not more comfort and style in my opinion as the Lexus line of car.  I was also very impressed by the price.  I expected over 35K easily for this car and was shocked to see it fully loaded at only about 31.5K.  This made my decision to buy the Avalon even easier.  For anyone wanting to purchase a new car, go for the 2000 Avalon.  You can't go wrong.<br><br>
