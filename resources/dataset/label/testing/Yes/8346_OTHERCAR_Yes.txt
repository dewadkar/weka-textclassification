            Granted, we are not talking about an expensive camera here.  However, this little camera works well for certain applications.

Considering the resolution is only 640x480 pixels, you should limit the use of the camera to fairly &quot;close-up&quot; shots.  If you try to photograph sweeping landscapes, you will end up with a picture that looks more like a painting than a photo.

I purchased my Largan 350 in Sept 1999 on eBay.  I paid $101 for it; if you are considering this camera today, I wouldn't give more than $50 or $60 dollars for it.  As with some of the other reviewers, I have added a more expensive digital camera(Olympus D-360L) to my collection, for times when I need impressive picture quality.

The Largan 350 works best in daylight.  If you must use the flash, be sure you are close to your subject.  Basically, since there is no cost for film, you must do a lot of experimenting to learn what this little camera can do.

Largan includes all the necessary cables, including an AC adapter.  This is a good feature, so you don't kill the batteries during picture downloads.  The batteries that Largan sent me with the camera were pretty much dead.  To their credit, they sent me two more batteries when I complained about the dead ones.   You should buy some name brand Duracells or Energizers, and have at least one &quot;back-up&quot; battery with you. The little battery meter on the camera is a liar!  Don't trust it!  When the camera starts to refuse to take pictures, you will know it's time for a new battery.   Don't worry about changing the battery on the fly, the pictures in the flash memory don't seem to be lost if you switch batteries.

This would be a great digital camera for a young person, maybe a teenager that just wants to learn about digital cameras.  You will be very happy with the little Largan 350, as long as you don't expect too much.   Remember, I wouldn't pay more than $50 or $60 for this camera.<br><br>
