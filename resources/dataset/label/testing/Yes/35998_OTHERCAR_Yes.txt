            My very first vehicle is a Mitsubishi Montero. I bought it in 1992 and I still use it for everyday commute. I can honestly say that the vehicle takes care of you if you take good care of it. Al though now I can afford another vehicle I still keep it because of the space it can hold, its reliability in all types of weather and its good road handling.

I have to admit that I am not very regular in its oil change, but despite of that it is still in good working condition. There are a lot of service centers I can bring it to with fast and reliable repairs. So far, the only problem I had with it is when my batteries ran out of power because I left the lights on on a winter's day, and when the battery water dried up a couple of summers ago.

Its interior is gorgeous, much like you are a pilot of a major jetliner. Another good feature is its 3 control suspension system. You have 3 choices for the suspension depending on the road condition.

I have to say that one major trouble I had with it was the ABS system. After four years of daily use  I had to change the ABS system due to wear and tear. Otherwise I am happy to own it and probably will continue to use it until it dies on me.
