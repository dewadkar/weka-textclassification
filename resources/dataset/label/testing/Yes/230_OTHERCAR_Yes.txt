            I have always love to look at good pictures, and always want to learn to shoot better photos.  However, I don't feel good shooting test photos on 35mm camera because the bad one would be wasted, and I won't be able to know the results until I develop the film, which will take days.

So, digital camera definitely come into place.  I looked at Olympus 3030 and the Nikon 990.  Even though the image quality came out from those camera seems really good, the expensive storage issue was keeping me from buying a digicam.  Then, I saw the G1 in Comdex LV, 2000.  The camera looks very nice, very traditional camera look. It feels really solid.  And look at the features, wow!  It support many different shooting mode, movie, etc (lot's of reviewer have listed the features, so I won't waste the space here), and most importantly, the 1GB microdrive.  After reading many favourable reviews on the G1 (eg. www.dpreview.com), and realizing I can get the camera and the 1GB drive for about $1200, I decided to buy it.

So far everything works real well with this camera.  I have shoot many macro pictures on flowers and plants in my garden.  Most pictures turned out good, even though some are out of focus, most likely because of my faults.  I haven't had chance to shoot scenery.

The camera is really user friendly.  The menu is easy to navigate, all the options are easily accessible.  After reading the user manual, I can remember how to set everything.  The software included are very easy to setup and use.  I have tried downloading the pictures from USB, or through PCMCIA slot, and they all work very well.

Battery life is good, but not as great as what I expected.  The low battery indicator light show up after half day of shooting, with the LCD on most of the time.

I have also shoot my whole backyard with paranoma mode, and then merge the pictures using stich assist.  The auto merge works very well, and I create my first ever paranoma picture, which is really cool.

Shooting movie is easy, but I have to say the image quality is bad.  It is useful to shoot some fun video sequence, but definitely not for good video segment.  But it is fun to be able to preview the movie with sound on the camera.  

I'm still learning using the camera and shooting good photos.  With the extensive features in this camera, I think it will take long time for me to out grow it, if that ever happens.

If you want a digital camera, and if the price is not an issue, the G1 is definitely worth considering.<br><br>
