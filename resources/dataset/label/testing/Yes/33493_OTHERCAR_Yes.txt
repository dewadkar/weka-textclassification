            In the UK, Subaru transformed their image from worthy, reliable, 4WD utility car makers to supercar manufacturers almost overnight with the World Rally Championship winning Impreza turbo.
Impreza turbos had been around for a while in 220bhp UK guise, but when people realised that the Japanese domestic market got better, more powerful versions � and in Right Hand Drive � the imported Impreza market exploded.

The ultimate expression of this phenomenon (up until 1999 at least) was the limited production  22B Impreza Coupe.

Subaru Tecnica International (STi) function in much the same way as Nismo for Nissan, AMG for Mercedes, and Motorsport for BMW, in that they take a stock model and make significant performance enhancements that are still covered by factory warranties. 

STi had really worked overtime on the 22B, and in standard UK spec it included:
2 door coupe bodyshell (not then available on �normal� UK cars)
�280bhp� engine (officially, all Japanese cars follow a voluntary 280bhp limit, but this is widely thought to be in name only. The 22Bs were first thought to have 350bhp, although that�s disputed now)
Widened wheel arches
17inch Gold Speedline wheels
Uprated suspension, brakes, steering, gearbox., 
Water spray for the intercooler
STi Spoilers,  Foglamp covers, and badges
Adjustable fore-aft power transfer, etc, etc.

An STi tuned Impreza is most definitely a car for detail nuts. The specifications list goes on and on, including carbon fibre strut braces, roof vents, short throw gearboxes, thinner glass, deletion of airbags, and so on. To buy an STi tuned Subaru is to be incredibly in tune with detail. 
Save to say that the 22B, at �40,000 had everything that was available.

I was in the process of replacing a �96 911 C4, when I happened across a 22B for sale. With only 3000 miles and less than four months old, this was an official UK import, and price-wise it looked about on a par with the 911. I thus negotiated an extended test drive, whereby I took the car for a long weekend, with a view to purchase.

First impression � Space. 
Compared to the 911, anything is spacious, but the 22B did offer genuine adult comfort in front, and good child comfort in rear. Additionally, the rear windows are darkened, which makes it slightly more comfortable in hot weather � although the A/C is very effective. 
The darkened windows did elicit some protests from my son, who claimed he couldn�t see properly�

Looks-wise, the 22B is brutally impressive. Finished in metallic Mica Blue, with those gold wheels, bonnet sprouting vents, scoops and holes, and a rear wing almost in line with the roof, it positively shouts aggression on the road.

But you know what they look like. How did it drive?

This had been chipped to provide a true 385 bhp, and with a racing clutch, it was a nightmare to get going. If you�ve ever driven a stick shift Harley Davidson with the foot clutch �suicided� you�ll get the idea. The clutch is enormously heavy, and functions like an on/off switch. So you get the revs up to compensate for progression, and either leap forward, or stall. Not particularly user-friendly�

Once you get going, it is a very good car. It really is glued to the road � a sensation enhanced by race-tuned suspension that appears to be made entirely of steel, aluminium, and carbon fibre, with not a spring or a rubber bush to be felt anywhere. It is jarring. But then I guess that is the price of ultimate roadholding.

Steering feel is excellent, and acceleration (0-60 time on this version was 3.7 seconds) is astonishing. All the more so because essentially you�re driving a 2 door farmer�s wagon.

I have no idea about the top speed � being academic anyway; but I do know that you never really have to slow down, unless the traffic conditions tell you to. Corners? They are like bends in this thing. 
About the only limiting factor in its cornering is the lateral g, and the cries of fear emanating from the other inhabited seats as their occupants' bones try to exit their bodies sideways.

What about those rally toys?
The water spray for the intercooler is supposed to cool it further, giving a more condensed charge in the turbos, but like you�d notice. It�s a good button, though, and it makes a nice buzz when you push it. It also leaves a puddle of water under the car if it�s stationary.
And the adjustable power transfer fore/aft slider control. Are you really going to adjust it mid bend as you feel the back step out? I doubt it. 

But who cares? They�re great toys to talk about!

How about the brakes? Superb. Progressive, and amazingly efficient, but they did take a fair shove to activate. 

Throttle response is excellent, and turbo lag � which despite what people say is NOT unnoticeable � is as small as you�ll find on any car equipped with an exhaust-driven blower.

Practicality � it has a big boot, only slightly hampered by the (carbon-fibre, naturally) strut brace between the two suspension uprights. 

Under the hood is a great sight � all cars are complicated these days, but this one is amazing. Mainly for all it�s racer-chic items. Strut Braces, gold coloured filler caps, intercooler radiators, turbo wastegate things, anodised pipe connectors. Wow. 
Again � great talking points.

Comfort? Well the STi special seats are grippy. Hard, but not uncomfortable. I never had a complaint during my brief tenure, but then I only did one long (over 100 miles) trip. I did put over 400 miles on the car in the weekend, and never felt bad due to the seats.

Other comfort factors like Noise, Vibration, Harshness (NVH) are where this car lets itself down. To drive, it�s not comfortable. It�s noisy � whistling turbos, chattering wastegates, crashing suspension, tramlining wheels, little sound deadening, and demands concentration. 
To be driven in � it�s merely uncomfortable and scary.

Come the end of the weekend, I took it back to do the deal on the 911. Only I didn�t - I kept the 911.

The 22B is at least as quick, and is more practical � but I really think I could not live with it day to day. Not all my driving is on a track. Much of it is to the shops and back, or just getting from A to B with minimum effort. 
The 22B demands 100% attention and commitment 100% of the time, and I just wasn�t prepared to give that. 

The image is too much as well. The thing is just shouting �I�m going too fast � please give me a ticket� even when it�s parked. I also couldn�t live with wiping all the schoolboy fingerprints off the windows each time I returned to it�

But that Subaru thing endures.

A while later, I tried a more normal Impreza Coupe STi Version 5 WRX LTD  (the nomenclature�s almost as detailed as the car!) in black, with a similar spec engine, but with less tuned suspension. This was more liveable, but ultimately not comfortable enough. 

Anyway, that one was overshadowed in this impulse-buyer�s mind by a Mitsubishi EVO VI in the same showroom � even faster, with Brembo brakes, loads of carbon fibre, and with that must-have - anti-yaw control . 
Whatever that is. Great.

So the 22B was passed up, and I bought a Mercedes C43 (q.v.). 

But a good friend has recently got himself what might be the ultimate Impreza in real life. Not 2000�s ultimate, the P1; but a 1997 UK-supplied Impreza turbo 4 door. 
In Dark Green, with silver 17 inch Speedlines, and a 300bhp chip. No STi spoilers, no messing � just a great, fast, practical, and subtle car. And it cost less than half a 22B�

So would I buy a 22B now. 

Well actually, yes.  The thing is so remarkably competent, and so outrageous, that it is compelling. And I did willingly put 400 miles on it, when I really had nowhere to go.

And they�re cheaper now. So watch this space, maybe a full owner�s opinion will be posted soon�
