            We needed a large car, but didn't want a gas-guzzler, like our previous Nissan Pathfinder, and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg.  While purchasing a used Hyundai for our son, we noticed the (then) new Sonata, and how luxurious it looked.  On learning its price, we decided that we would like to buy it, especially when the dealer enabled us to trade-in our Pathfinder.
   We love its comfortable ride, its easy drivability, and the dealer's use of a loaner car for scheduled servicing.  We also love the Hyundai 100,000 mile, 10 year warranty on the car.  We are a little put out that the back seat won't fold down, and that it is a little less than efficient on gas mileage, but these are not biggies.  All in all, we think it's a great car, and have become a 4-car Hyundai family.
   At the beginning, the car was the dealer's nightmare.  No-one could figure out why the gas tank couldn't be filled.  After extensive research, including flying in a guy from Hyundai headquarters, they discovered that the stopper used to protect the gas tank while painting had not been removed, and had become lodged inside the gas tank!  Our car is now famous at Hyundai headquarters, and was written up in their literature. 
   We recommend this car constantly to our friends, and replaced our VW Gulf with an Elantra wagon (review on this to follow).  Most people are very impressed with the look of the vehicle, and surprised by the price.  We think everyone should buy one!    <br><br>
