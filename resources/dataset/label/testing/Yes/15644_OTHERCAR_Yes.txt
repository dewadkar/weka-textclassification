              I can honestly say this is the best camera I've ever owned.  I have taken at least 20,000 pictures with it and never had a break down of any component.  It is easy to use once you go thru the manual and take a little time to actually read it.  There are so many features that you'll be glad you took the time.

  Picture quality in &quot;fine&quot; mode if terrific and very good in &quot;standard&quot; mode.  Of course the greatest feature with these Sony cameras is the use of floppy disks for storage.  You can easily share pictures with anyone who has a computer with a floppy drive.  No extra cords to connect, no special software needed.  In my opinion THAT is what makes this camera so special.  The flash is on the weak side though.  It is only good for about 8 to 10 feet away. 

  Aperture and/or shutter speed can be manually selected if desired.  Spot metering comes in handy in bright background situations.  Email sized movies many be taken in 20 second (fine) or 1 minute (standard) settings with sound.  You can also use it for taking voice memos only.

  We used it at a family re-union and the results were spectacular.  Made a great screen saver.  The only extra things we miss that don't come with the camera is a carrying case but everyone has their own preference on those.  We also purchased a tripod for it, separately, and the longer lasting battery for a spare.  We have owned it over 14 months.  Overall we are extremely pleased with the FD-91.  Thank you Sony!<br><br>
