                Aloha! I purchased my G20 used, 3 1/2 years ago for $7200 from a private owner. I did a lot of research before I set my sights on this car and I am very satisfied with it. It is a 5-speed manual, with leather and moonroof. I have driven it for 50,000 miles out of its current 125,000 miles and although it is now 10 years old, it runs quietly and powerfully (140 hp) and still appears to have a lot of life left in it. When I say powerfully, it is with respect to other 4-cylinder engines. It has been pretty reliable, although it has seen the insides of a repair shop now and then, mainly for maintenance issues. Several consumer guides report that this model has top notch reliability and that was one of the main factors behind my purchase.

    The ride is relatively quiet and the engine is very smooth. Good tires do make a difference as I noticed a much quieter and better ride when I replaced the tires with Michelins. Even under pressure, the engine makes a pleasant sound that indicates that it could be pushed even further, if necessary. The car exhibits responsive and sporty handling and is a joy to drive.

The thick leather seating is of high quality and very comfortable. There are large side bolsters which hug your body and prevent any sliding in turns, adding to the feeling of being in control.

Fuel economy is very good. I do a fair amount of highway driving and get about 28 to 30 mpg overall on regular unleaded.  Again, my car is a manual transmission.

Another one of the reasons I like my car is that it is pretty unique.  Other Japanese automakers may make good cars, but they are produced in such great quantities.  In my immediate neighborhood, I am aware of just two other G20s and none are the same color, so I feel that my car is special.  While driving I am always on the lookout for other G20s and it is a small treat to spot one :)

The paint quality is exceptional.  I believe that Infiniti went out of their way to put quality into their paint jobs. Except for rock chips, the paint looks new. I guess in combination with its rarity and shiny exterior, many people think that my car is much newer than it is.

On the other hand, there are some minor things that I do not like about my car.  The first is the automatic seatbelts.  I would much prefer standard seatbelts.  There has been a few instances where I opened the door while sticking my head out the window and the moving belt slapped across my head.  Also, I have had passengers who were startled when the "motorized mouse" runs along the window frame and the belt gets wrapped up around their arms.

Another problem is that the vinyl/plastic coating around the stick shift/center divider has deteriorated. I think I wiped it with Armor All and now the vinyl has softened and become tacky, causing dust to get stuck to it.  I'm not sure if it's just age, or the Armor All that has caused this problem.

Another disadvantage is that the car collects dirt quickly. After driving in the rain, or in dusty conditions, the sides and rear of the car show a lot of dirt which is kicked up from the wheels. Granted my car is a light ivory color, but I think it has something to do with the design of the car or the performance tires as none of my previous cars showed this degree of rapid dirt deposition. I notice that when driving in wet weather, my car seems to make a bigger splash/spray trail than many other cars.  Also, because the rear windshield is angled sharply, water doesn't drain off as easily, leading to water spots. 

A fourth disadvantage is that replacement parts and service can be very expensive and not as readily available as with other brands.  For example, when my muffler needed replacement, Midas said they would have to special order a muffler for more than $250 and when I called the dealer, I believe the cost just for the muffler was over $400.  I had to make several calls before I found a muffler at a reasonable price.  Also, if you get serviced at the dealer, which in my case is also a Nissan dealership, they charge a higher labor rate to service an Infiniti.

The last thing I wanted to mention is that compared to other Japanese luxury brands, Infinitis show high depreciation. This works to your advantage, however, if you are buying used.

If you are considering buying a G20, this model came out in '91 and continued through '96. There was a break until a new G20 came out in '99. This 2nd generation model has not had as good reviews as the original.
