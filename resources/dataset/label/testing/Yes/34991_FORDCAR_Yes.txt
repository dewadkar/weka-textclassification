            I bought this car because I had the exact amount of money, $3500.  I needed a car, and this is my first one.  I bought it with 94K on it, and it now has 107K.

I love the handling and the front seats. They offer great supports.  The engine is surprisingly mundane, bringing the manual to 60 in about 8.2 seconds, the auto in about 8.8.  The rear seats aren't the best but really aren't bad for a sports coupe..rear seat comfort shouldn't be in your list when you buy this car.  The trunk space is great!  The heater is excellent, and my a/c is out so no comment on that.  Controls are well-laid and the instruments are easy to see, clear, and can't be blocked by the steering wheel due to the tilt wheel.  The fuel filter is easy to replace, as are the spark plugs (they do however require the removal of the intake manifold).

I don't like the little quirks about the car and the fact that it's hard to troubleshoot problems.  I don't like the fact I had to replace many gaskets, but that's what I get for a car around 100k, that likely hasn't been maintained good from the previous owner(s). Also, the Automatic shifts roughly, I regret settling with an automatic.  I also don't like the rattles from the hatch.

The handling again is excellent, no oversteer nor understeer.  Very predictable.  The low-end torque delivers great passing speed.  The Probe is a fun car to drive!

If you want a good first car or a second drive around car the 89-92 probe is a great choice.  Try to get one around 80K miles (or lower), they are not hard to find.  The price ranges from $2000-4000.

Note I have taken the car into the shop a lot of times, but a lot of times nothing was wrong, another was the breaks, and then tires.<br><br>
