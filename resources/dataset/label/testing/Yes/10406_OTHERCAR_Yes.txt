            I have just solved one of the family's camera problems.  No more complaints from my wife about not having access to my [<a href="/content_51138891396">DX3700 Kodak</a>] camera!  I found this Olympus Camedia C-50 Zoom Digital Camera that I could not pass on.  It was a great present idea for my wife.  In fact, it's the right kind of camera she needed on the road.  I knew for sure she would be attracted to this 5-megapixel resolution, stylish, all-metal frame camera.  After using it on a few occasions, I personally have come to fall in love with some of its features.  I like the fact that it comes with a battery charger which comes handy on the road.  Besides, its rechargeable Lithium LI-10B battery can last a long time. 

Another great Olympus camera is the <a href="/content_81208315524">Camedia C4000</a>.  Read about its features. 

<b>What are some of the attractive points of the C-50?</b>

Right off the bat, I will admit that this camera, however small it be, comes equipped with lots of features that may not remind you of the great point-and-shoot feature found in most other cameras.  That does not diminish it either.  For the few occasions my wife let me use it, I will say that I have left in the default mode and just proceed to take my shots.  I did not have to mess around with its menu structure and other parameters.  While talking about the features of the C-50, it's worth noting that you can shoot in full auto, full manual, aperture, or shutter priority, or six program modes plus one user-defined mode. 

I was amazed by the length of time I could shoot without having to recharge.  The battery life was good for more than 2 and a half hours.  I took about 325 shots.  

The C-50 camera comes with the following features:
*five-mode flash,
*auto and manual white balance plus four presets, 
*auto and 80 to 320 ISO equivalency, 
*two-stop exposure compensation, 
*sharpening and brightness adjustments.

With 5 MP, you can expect the high quality of the images you shoot.  This little camera has nothing to worry about its competitors ranging from the Konica KD-500Z and Canon PowersShot S45 in terms of image quality and feature set.  For the small price I had to pay, I can say that the C-50 delivers on the images. 

<i>Other important features that can be found in the C-50 Zoom Digital Camera</i>

Just take a deep look at the C-50 camera, you will notice that its zoom lens is protected with a sliding metal shutter that doubles as the power switch.  Turn it around and you will find out that on its back is the well-known ten-position select/mode dial, a four-way jog button, and a Quick View button.  As you press the Quick View button, you will be able to see the display of the last captured image.  By pressing it twice, it will go between shooting and playback.  I have fallen in love with the high-resolution 1.5-inch LCD viewfinder which is bright and sharp.  

With this camera, you can also shoot videos at 320-by-240 or 160-by-120 at 15 fps, but the camera has no audio capability.  At least, you can have a 16-second worth of movie.

Shutter speed 1/2-1/1000 sec

The C-50 camera comes bundled with a battery charger, wireless remote control, and a small 32 MB xD Picture Card memory card.

<b>What are my closing thoughts?</b>

If you want a sharp, small camera to take on the road with you, you should invest in the C-50.  So far, my wife and I have loved it.
