            Man, what I year I've had.  I've had to make sacrifices and compromises I never thought I would.  I  finally got some bucks back and the first area I was going to "un-compromise"  was my car.  I had been driving an 89 V-6 Firebird.  It was a great little car, and yes, I reviewed it.  I could have stuck with it, I liked it enough.  However, having the means, I decided to get my V-8  back.  

I thought it was going to be in the form of a used Camaro Z-28, but this Trans Am caught my eye.  It was a 1998 chameleon blue beauty that just had my name written all over it.  I had seen this color before and I knew it was hard to come by.  This is an iridescent color that is metallic jade green in the sun and metallic blue in the shade.  In between it turns about a dozen different shades of deep aqua.  In short, it�s gorgeous.

GM use to be known for their fit and finish problems.  They have more than redeemed themselves.  I�ve seen the finishes on a lot of cars and this one is darn near perfect.  I swear, it is smooth and flat and glossy and wonderful.  The interior is a dark gray leather and vinyl.  Beautiful chrome wheels and low profile Good Year tires finish the look.

I�ve read most of the reviews of the Trans Am and Camaro cars and I feel they have been slighted by many.  There isn�t much middle ground, that�s for sure.  People either love or hate them, and I reckon that�s a good thing.  An old fashioned American muscle car should be a wishy-washy subject.

I�m going to give you the details I didn�t like first and hopefully finish on a high note.  Lots of folks gripe about hardware details.  The power seat switch and the multi-function turn signal are favorites for GM bashers.  Yes, they could be modernized.  The turn signal looks rather dated when viewed with the very modern instrument panel.  The fact is this thing works.  I�ve seen my share of really futuristic looking ones that are specially designed for a specific model car.  Here are the drawbacks to those.  

You have to re-learn the location every time you drive a different car.  That special design also costs a lot more than you would think.  GM put those bucks into motor and drive train development.  If you want a performance car and you want a reasonable price tag, you want the car maker to do things like that.

The fastest and most uncomfortable car I ever had the privilege of driving was a Ferrari 30 GTB.  (think Magnum PI)  It was a really sweet machine but I wouldn�t drive it everyday, and I can�t afford one.  The Trans Am is in the same performance envelope, but you can use it as your daily driver.  The Trans Am is very comfortable and the front seats are quite roomy.  The back seat is the same as it has been since the late 70�s, small.  Great for young kids or short trips for adults and that�s about it.

Let�s talk a bit about that much maligned lump on the driver�s side.  Look, the catalytic converter had to go somewhere.  There is considerably more than aesthetics involved when placing such a critical component.  OK, if performance isn�t paramount, you can stick the thing almost anywhere.  The Trans Am is a performance car and the exhaust system is an integral part of the whole package.  A marathon runner wouldn�t be expected to breathe through a soda straw.  So you can�t expect performance cars to have a restrictive or poorly designed exhaust system.

I�ve ridden in the passenger seat.  When you�re in the car, you don�t know the lump is there.  I think what some people, particularly women, object to is the �legs out� position that most of these type cars require.  Ever sit in a Porsche?  Your calves rub the floor mats.  Same with the Corvette.  This is a car, not a lounge chair.  Just move your seat forward a bit and your knees come up and the problem is solved.

OK, now the good stuff.  GM is going to (supposedly) kill the Firebird and Camaro off in 2002.  Of course they are, it�s just about perfect.  Remember the Fiero GT?  Just when they get it looking and performing like it should they kill it.  The last year Fiero GT�s are wonderful sports cars and I believe will prove to be the sleeper of the decade.  If I hadn�t needed a back seat for my two little ones, I would have found one.

The Firebird in Trans Am trim has incredible power and handling.  This thing is just a hoot to fling around.  It will do pretty much anything you want except evade radar.  It gets very good gas mileage as well. Even with a fair amount of aggressive driving, I get 19 mpg around town.  A steady 80 mph on the interstate will yield a whopping 28 mpg!

I made sure I got the 6 speed manual.  I hereby nominate this transmission for the automobile hall of fame.  It is that good.  5th and 6th are both overdrive.  80 mph is exactly 2 grand on the tach.  Remarkable.  I could live without the �skipshift� feature though.  For those of you unfamiliar with this transmission, when you drive economically, it gates you from 1st to 4th.  You skip 2nd and 3rd.  The motor has more than enough torque to pull it off, it just feels a little unnatural.  Brisk acceleration, or a slight pause between 1st and 2nd opens the gate and shifting is normal.

As for gauges, accessories et al, they are plentiful and very well positioned.  Driving is a pleasure and the car doesn�t demand a lot of your attention in order to drive it.  You can focus on the road like you�re supposed to.  The Monsoon stereo is excellent.  I can�t for the life of me figure out why someone would want to replace it.  People do, and I guess it�s a matter of taste.  As an electronic engineer and a bit of an audiophile, I can tell you that it is very hard and very expensive to do better that the factory stereo in the Trans Am.

All in all, I love this car.  I got my V-8 back, and it is a pleasure to drive.  I love the styling on the Trans Am.  Previously I detested the �Batmobile� style nose.  The current body style is just right.  Wonderfully curvaceous, but everything looks like it serves a purpose.  If you�re in the market for performance and you truly understand what a performance car is, then you would do well to give the Trans Am a look.  A good long one.
