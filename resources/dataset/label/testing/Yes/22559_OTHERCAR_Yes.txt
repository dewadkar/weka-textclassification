            We just bought our 2nd Mazda MPV this year.  Our first one an 89 had 185,000 miles on it and was still going strong.  We traded it in for a 4-wheel drive version that is a '93.  I love driving it and it's so easy to handle and load up with my 3 small children.  

The thing that sold me on the MPV to begin with was the size, resale value, and the back door that opens and closes like a regular door rather than the sliding doors on other minivans.  It has lots of room for our 3 small children, but I see that we will probably outgrow it as our family grows.  We've taken it on several trips and it has handled well.  The gas mileage is good and the towing capacity if great.  

I wish it were a little bigger so we could continue with them, but due to expanding family and growing legs we will probably have to switch to something bigger next time.  

The MPV handles like a car and is easy to park and maneuver.  I would recommend it to any young family or couple who needs to haul things.  <br><br>
