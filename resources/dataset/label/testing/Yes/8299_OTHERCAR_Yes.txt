            I was not really looking for this car when I was shopping to replace my Chevy.  I needed to carry few more body instead of hauling, so I was looking for a car.  My first target was Toyota Matrix, new type of a vehicle.  Not a sedan, not a SUV, but totally new kind.  I was also looking Nissan Sentra SER V-Spec and Mitsubishi Lancer OZ-Rally.  I am not used to drive sedan, so I wanted a sedan with some distinguished look.  

I test drove Nissan and Mitsubishi.  They both were very good cars.  Although, I was not totally impressed.  Nissan was 6 speed stick.  New and sporty, but do we really need 6 speed on the public street??? Mitsubishi was small but good response, but it is actually a normal Lancer with fake Air spoiler and aluminum wheel.  Then, I went to Toyota dealership.  I requested a test drive of Matrix.  It is a small car.  It's like stretched 5 door hatchback.  Nice big space inside and good design operation panel.  I drove a few block and I fell in love.  It was a great small car.  After the test drive, I saw a Corolla sitting in the lot.  I asked a sales guy if I can drive that as well.  After all, Matrix is a Corolla with different body.  I drove 5 speed CE.  Very quiet.  Actually quieter than Matrix.  I did not care about the panel design, but simple and nice.  Good spacious room.  Actually rear sheet is bigger than Matrix.  I drove a couple of blocks and I asked a guy if I can drive a little longer.  Good acceleration
on and good brake.   2nd gear can take you to 45 MPH right away.  Has CD player as standard.  I really liked this car by the time I was done with the test drive.  I asked for the price and was very surprised.  This model is only $13,550.  Hey...are you sure???  Nissan is $18,000, Mitsubishi is $17,000 and Matrix is $16,000.  This is only $13,550???  With low rate for the loan, my monthly payment is less than what I was paying for my truck.  And you know, I was driving this back home that night.

This new Corolla is not really Corolla.  When you check with Toyota Corolla in Japan, it is much smaller inside and out.  A little different design.  There are a couple more models that Toyota offers in Japan that is a little bigger than Corolla.  I think this new Corolla is one of them.  Just comparing with previous model of Corolla, the size is much bigger and much more spacious inside.  Also, more powerful engine.  This Corolla shouldn't be called Corolla.  I used to drive Camry in Japan in year 1988.  This Corolla is actually the same size with my old Camry.  

Are you looking for a small sedan??  I can tell you, Toyota Corolla is your choice.
