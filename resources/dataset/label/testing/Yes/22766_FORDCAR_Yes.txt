            Being 18, and having to commute to work, home, school, and everywhere else getting an explorer was the greatest thing I have ever done. When it came time to get a new car...I had to take many personal hobbies into affect. Living in California I knew I wanted a vehicle that was able to carry luggage for our small road trips to the desert, beach, mountains, river, and Los Angeles. Plus we needed a vehicle that we could lay down in and sleep in when we went to the desert and mountains. Also, we wanted something that had 4-wheel drive, and could handle roughness, (especially the way my soon to be husband drives). Also planning for kids is a big thing, and I couldn't think of a better vehicle for a family. I look forward to driving my kids to baseball practice, and gymnastics in our family explorer. My husband (soon to be) and I have already made plans to keep this one, have it paid off in 2 more years, and buy a brand new one for our new house. It is the funnest thing to drive around. My first car was a small 2-door ford escort. It was a great little car, but very old. My biggest fear was...if I were to get in an accident...I don't want to be the one getting ran over...I want a big enough car to protect my family and I.  I would rather do the running over, and be better off. Try one. Test drive! I'm telling...You'll fall in love with it just like I did!<br><br>
