            I recently purchased a decked out 2000 Buick Regal LS from my local Buick dealer, and i'm happy to say I am not let down.

The car has a very smooth ride, which is only complimented by the very comfortable bucket leather seats. The car seems to literally glide on air and it also turns on a dime. I have no complaints whatsoever with the ride. The very powerful V6 provides ample power to go from point A to point B, and much, much, more. This is a very fast machine, folks. I was very surprised with how much kick this car has, considering it has a V6. The car of course, performs very well on wet roads and the brakes work excellent.

A surround sound Monsoon CD/Cassette audio system also came with my car. This works very well, like the rest of the car, and provides enough bass and the very well placed speakers just add to its performance. Even the CD player has certain special touches, such as extra controls on the steering wheel, and even glow in the dark lights in the player so you can switch CD's at night. It's these extra little touches that make this car excellent. Opening up the moonroof while cruising down the highway is fun to do, also :)

There are only two complaints I have about this car. I got the car in black, and the paint is already starting to lose its gloss here and there, even though I purchased it recently. However, you can not notice it unless you were looking for it, and the black still shines radiantly in the sun. But as with any black car, you have to wash it often, as every little thing, such as dirt, or the occasional bird doo-doo, shows up on the car. But that was to be expected :)

The car also came with the chrome hubcaps, which are stunning with the black paint. However, in the grooves of them, the chrome is starting to fade. However, this is only a minor problem, and the rest of it seems to be doing fine and shows no signs of fading.

Overall, this is a A+ car, and a very enjoyable ride. The price is a little high for most people (Mine was $30,000) but it is a outstanding car and I heartily recommend it.
