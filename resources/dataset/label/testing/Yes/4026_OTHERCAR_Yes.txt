            MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY 2000 TAHOE HAS BEEN GREAT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS.  I WAS ALARMED TO FIND THAT THE WINDOWS IN THE SECOND SEAT AREA DID NOT WORK.  ONE WINDOW HAD NEVER ROLLED DOWN AND THE OTHER ONLY WORKED THREE TIMES FROM THE DRIVER CONTROLS.  IT TOOK THREE TRIPS TO MY DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THIS CORRECTED.

I, TOO, EXPERIENCE A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS AROUND TOWN THAT I DRIVE OFTEN.  I EXPERIENCE THE SAME SITUATION EACH TIME I BRAKE AT THESE INTERSECTIONS AND HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO MY SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ATTENTION ON EACH VISIT.  THEY HAVE YET TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NOT DRIVEN IT.  ON A VISIT A WHILE BACK, THEY INSISTS THIS IS HOW THE ABS WORKS, AND MY EXPERIENCE IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.
THE PROBLEM IS THIS:  IF YOU ARE BRAKING AND YOU ENCOUNTER A BUMP OR POT HOLE IN THE ROAD, THE BRAKING SYSTEM GOES INTO A NON BRAKING MODE FOR ABOUT 4 SECONDS OR THE DISTANCE OF A CAR LENGTH BEFORE RESUMING BRAKING.  IF YOU ARE APPLYING YOU BRAKES AT A FASTER THAN NORMAL SPEED OR WITHIN A SHORTER DISTANCE AND THERE IS SOMEONE ALREADY STOPPED IN FRONT OF YOU, YOU MAY HIT THEM IN THE REAR.  

MY MOST RECENT PROBLEM HAS BEEN WITH A LEAK IN THE TRANSMISSION.  MY TAHOE IS IN THE SHOP AT THIS WRITING, FOR THE 6TH TIME. I HAVE HAD THE SEALS REPLACED MORE THAN ONCE, THE SHAFT REPLACED AND WAS TOLD ON THIS VISIT, THAT THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION WAS BEING REPLACED.  AFTER 2 DAYS AND MORE SEALS, THEY ORDERED THE TRANSMISSION YESTERDAY.

I HOPE TO FOLLOWUP WITH A GREAT ENDING TO THIS STORY.  I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY CONCERNS WITH THE PROBLEMS I HAVE EXPERIENCED.

IF THESE TWO THINGS WERE ADDRESSED AND CORRECTED I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY CAR!
