            When comparing the Integra to its competitors in the domestic car market, the upgrades that Acura keeps up with its sports car is quite evident.  The engine though not as powerfull as the big muscle cars is very efficient in its cylinder to horsepower ratio.  Only the advanced technology of products and thanks to Acura engineers do we have such a well rounded sports car.  The Integra has excellent handling and its cornering is breathtaking.  The GSR or VTEC edition of the Integra comes with a body kit and customized Acura GSR rims.  I consider the Integra to be a definite pick for me over the domestic car market i.e. Mustangs and Camaros, as well as the import market.  <br><br>
