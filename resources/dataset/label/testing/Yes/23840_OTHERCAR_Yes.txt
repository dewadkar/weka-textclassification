            When my wife wanted to drive something creative, pragmatic and reliable, she tried out the Echo to see what Toyota's new creation was like and she had a &quot;Let's get this!&quot; look in her eyes before sundown.

The car is proving to be a great purchase because it satisfies the most important requirements we have: It is reliable, it handles very nicely and it is kind to a wallet. I've driven the car from the heart of Los Angeles to where we live, which is about a two-hour drive, and it handled beautifully. We traveled some stretches of highway with turtles pretending to be cars and had little trouble getting around them. We also maneuvered out of a sticky freeway situation in L.A. -- a great indicator in our minds.

What's just as nice is the look of the car. It isn't, well, boring. You can find lots of boxes with four wheels on a Southern California freeway that all look the same, but the Echo stands out in an appealing way. 

Some drivers might find the Echo's center-oriented instrument panel on the dashboard tough to adjust to, but my wife and I had little trouble with it. We have an automatic and adjusting to the center-oriented gear shift took a bit of time -- only because it had been a while since I'd driven such a vehicle. The Echo probably needed more time to warm up on a cold night than I allowed; it didn't run as smooth as I would like, but I haven't heard any complaints about its performance in cold from my wife. &quot;Cold&quot; where we live could be as low as 20 degrees in the dead of winter.

The Echo's creature comforts are terrific -- CD player, radio, very effective heater, loud alarm. That's always second-fiddle stuff with us, but it's nice to have and the Echo's are a good purchase.

An advantage my wife especially likes is how a driver sits a little higher than in a &quot;regular&quot; compact. You'll find yourself more &quot;above&quot; the road and that leads to better visibility of what surrounds you. That's priceless on a California road.

All in all, this is one purchase we don't think we'll regret.
