            Brown Wood Grain Siding, on a car?  I know you remember those long brown station wagons.  I learned how to drive in one of those station wagons, I referred to my parents car as the Tank.  

I have had my Taurus Wagon for two years now.  The wagon seats 8 people, we have the third backwards seat.

I never thought I would see myself saying &quot;Yes, I want a wagon&quot;, but I did.  We were trading in our Ford Windstar mini van which I liked but really did not want another mini van when I began my search for the perfect wagon.  We checked out the Camry but the drivers seat felt small and there was virtually no leg room for the middle seats. 

We still needed space, yet I didn't feel I needed to move around in it like you would in a van.  Having three kids we felt we needed that third seat. 

The wagaon drives smoothly and I have not had any trouble at all with it.  We take it in periodically for maintenance upkeep.

I absolutely love my car however, my husband feels a little cramped compared to the open feeling you have in a van.  Otherwise he loves the smooth and quiet ride you get.  Are kids have had one complaint, however, no cup holders.  Once you get them use to a van with a cup holder in every corner it is hard to go back.   <br><br>
