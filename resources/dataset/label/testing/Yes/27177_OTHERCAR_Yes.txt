                 Simply put, the 1998 Passat should be put in a category by itself.  This car outperforms all other cars in its class.  The ride of this car is one of a kind.  The Passat handles beautifully and for even a 150 horsepower, manual four cylinder, this car really accelerates.  When buying this car, there was no choice but a manual transmission.  You will reap the benefits for sure.  Other great features include: power seats, heated seats, driver, passenger, and side airbags, easy to operate climate controls, a standard red and purple display, and other features.  I have test drove many other cars in this class, and the Passat's features and handling are better than any other car.  Also, the price is fairly reasonable.  Finally, when buying this car, do not get the wagon edition.  It looks awful and you will be missing out on a lot of fun.  The standard edition is much better.
     There are a few negatives about this car.  First, the keyless entry sometimes fails to work all the time.  Also, the passenger seat is difficult to recline, as one has to turn a wheel to the right of the chair.  Yet, the positive aspects of this car alone are enough to make it the best in its class.<br><br>
