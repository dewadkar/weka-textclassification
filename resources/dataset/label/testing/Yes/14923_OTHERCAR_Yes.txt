            This camera is the best I have ever had.  I bought it so I could send photos by email to friends and family members.  It is very easy to operate .  I can take a photo at home and five minutes later the photo is in Georgia for my sister to view.  I have been getting as many as 24 photos to a disk.  The only problem I have is having enough blank disks on hand when shooting lots of photos.  The camera is light weight and can be carried around easily. Very durable will last forever. Any age person can use this camera from young to old.  You do not need much camera experience to operate this camera.<br><br>
