            My friend who owns a nightclub purchased a 1999 Cadillac DeVille last summer to replace his 1990 DeVille which has served him and his father well. His brother now has it with well over 140,000 miles and is still going strong. What I find interesting is that I own a 1994 DeVille which is the first of this generation of DeVille and he has the 1999 model which is the last of this generation. The 2000 model is all new and I felt he should've waited, but he got such a sweet deal, who could blame him?

Anyway, there are many similarities and many differences between the first and last of the 1994-99 Deville. Some good, some bad. The cars have the same body shell and drivetrain configuration and basically the same amenities. Here are some of the differences:

1994:  Base DeVille available with only 4.9 liter V-8
1999:  Base DeVille has 4.6 liter Northstar V-8 standard.

This is perhaps the biggest improvement over the 1994 model. I believe the Northstar is standard in all Cadillacs after 1996. The 4.9 is no slouch and can easily propel the car to 100 mph. However, the Northstar is a phenomenal engine with a better reputation than the 4.9 V-8. I've also heard that having the Northstar has a positive effect on resale value.

1994:  Grille is longer horizontally and narrower vertically.
1999:  Grille is taller vertically and narrower horizontally with a
       coarser cross-hatch pattern.

I prefer the 1994 grille for it makes the car look sleeker and lighter. For some reason I find the 1999 grille too &quot;Chevrolet-like.&quot; I do like the 1999 model's headlights with their clear lens and projector lamps better than the 1994 headlights with ordinary bulbs. 

1994:  Rear wheel openings have a &quot;semi-skirted&quot; look. 
       Concours has actual fender skirts.

1999:  Both Concours and DeVille rear wheel openings are fully cut out.

Once again I prefer the 1994's styling. Skirted rear wheels make the car more Cadillac-like. The fully cut out rear wheel openings on the 1999 model make the car appear too &quot;Chevrolet-like.&quot;

Aside from a few styling boo-boos the 1999 DeVille is a vastly improved car over my 1994. Fit and finish and hardware quality are vastly improved. The interior controls are more ergonomically designed and are made of better quality materials. The radio controls on my 1994 model are teeny little buttons. The 1999 radio controls are larger and easier to understand. Also, my friend's 1999 model comes standard with a CD and cassette. Mine is just AM/FM with cassette. The 1999 has more logical seat controls similar to those found on Lexus and Mercedes. Mine are a chrome &quot;joystick&quot; and two switches. Even the HVAC vents are improved. The 1999 model has vents color-keyed to the interior of the car, (my friend's car has a light gray leather interior)with little chrome accents. My 1994 with a neutral color interior has black vents made of Home Depot quality plastic.

Paint finish is a quantum leap over my 1994. My friend's 1999 model is a deep sable black that looks like you can actually reach your hand into it. I'm really happy to see this because if there's anything I can't stand about my '94 is the quality of the paint finish. The quality of the exterior trim is also much better. 

Driving my friend's car is a pleasure. The Northstar V-8 is smooth and responsive and has much more get up and go than my 4.9 V-8. The car also brakes and shifts smoother than my '94.  From what he tells me, gas mileage is pretty respectable too.

Maybe I didn't learn my lesson about not buying a car in it's first year. 
The 1999 model, despite some debatable styling issues, is a greatly improved car and shows how much GM can improve a car over 5 years. If only they can get it right the first time! I remember how lousy the 1984 Pontiac Fiero was compared to the awesome 1988 model when they dropped it. The same thing happened to the Cadillac Allante. The debut 1987 model was mediocre, but the 1993 model, which they also dropped, was fantastic. I am considering a 2000 DeVille, but maybe I'll wait until 2001 or 2002 when they work some of the bugs out.

All and all the 1999 Cadillac DeVille is a great car with much better quality and many improved features.
