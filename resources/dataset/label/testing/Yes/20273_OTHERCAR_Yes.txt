            This review will focus on the base 2002 GTI 1.8T with a 5-spd manual transmission and 17" wheels. I have owned a GTI for almost 3 months and have 4000 miles on the odometer. I hope you find this information useful.

VW has taken the 2932-pound Golf and made it fast and safe while still being fun to drive!  The GTI feels heavy, as most German cars do, but it reacts predictably and confidently when cornering and performing emergency maneuvers (like quick lane changes.)  The transmission offers a very 'positive' feel, so you will never need to wonder, "Is the car in gear?"  The engine is very peppy and the VW 'Sport Suspension' that comes standard on the GTI is a nice compromise between comfort and responsiveness.  For consumers looking for a fun drive to and from work, this is a great set-up.  The 180HP engine is averaging about 23 miles per gallon with hard city driving and 26 with normal city driving.  These may not be spectacular numbers, but not too bad for the returns in performance.  

The interior has good quality cloth bucket seats and access to the rear seats are excellent for a 3 door hatchback. The rear is roomy (for a hatchback.) Fold-down rear seats open the cargo area to an enormous amount of space that should be seen to be believed. The interior plastic on the climate controls, seats, and cargo area feel very cheap and should be used with a firm, but not forceful touch.  The most glaring aspect of the ill-engineered plastic are the driver and passenger seat releases.  The plastic is so thin; it would take very little force to snap off handle, as I already know from experience.  The interior controls on the column for turn signals, wipers, and cruise control feel solid and are intuitively positioned.  Headroom is very good for anyone less than 6'5".  

The driving position is very good, especially due the telescoping steering wheel and the inclusion of a generous amount of height adjustability.  The shifter has a nice ball shape and fits comfortably in almost any hand.  Shift throws are a little long, but not excessive.

The car comes standard with a CD Player and Cassette deck.  They are made for VW by Panasonic and the system is pre-wired for a VW CD Changer in the trunk.  A Panasonic changer can be added with a special adapter available at most car audio shops.  The display is very clear and the controls are large and easy to use.  Unfortunately, the FM reception is marginal and fidelity (although it may be the speakers) is not very good.  Upgrading to the Monsoon system should provide better quality electronics and speakers, but the hardware may not be commensurate with the additonal cost.  Serious consideration should be given to an aftermarket vendor if you would like decent sound quality.  If you are interested in matching the appearance of the unit to the interior lighting, Blaupunkt makes some products that come very close to the 'OEM' scheme.

VW Customer Service is an interesting story.  After taking delivery of the car, I noticed a large concrete nail deeply embedded near the sidewall.  Several trips to the dealership and a call to VW Customer Service were disappointing.  Let this be a lesson to anyone taking delivery of a new car; be sure to look at everything on the pre-delivery checklist.

Lastly, for VW enthusiasts, there is a great aftermarket that will allow the car to safely reach 230HP and handle like a true performance car, for less than $1500.  For those drivers that wish to visually enhance the interior and exterior of the car, there are dozens of manufacturers with products to fulfill just about all of your needs.
