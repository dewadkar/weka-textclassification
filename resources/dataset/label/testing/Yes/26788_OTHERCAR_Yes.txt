            Well.....I guess I'm the first one.  I was very excited when I first learned that the Saturn Corp. was designing an SUV.  I had found out through my local dealer, that the VUE, the new SUV would be available at the end of 2001.  Right after Thanksgiving, my dealer called me, and said that the new VUE was, and available for a test drive.  I was at the dealership within 20 minutes.  

I was first surprised by the power of the dual, overhead cam, V-6 3.0L engine.  The 181 horse power engine felt like the VUE lifted off of the ground, and came back down about three inches to the right.  It should be pointed out that I had a 1992 Saturn SC with four cylinders, so a V-6 was a big difference.  The ride was smooth, and I rapidly got up to 70 MPH.  The VUE felt stable, and solid, even at 70+.  The passenger compartment was huge, and it was the little details that really sold me.  Details such as 3 12 volt plugs; no transmission hump on the rear seat floor, standard CD player, and a really neat fold out grocery holder in the cargo area.  With 81 cubic feet of space, and the ability to fold the front passenger seat flat (to accommodate an 8 foot board with the tailgate closed), I knew I needed the VUE.  Unfortunately, the dealership would not let it go, it was the only one they had.  I had to wait for almost a month, before I could even see the colors that I wanted.  

In the end, I decided on the black/silver with gray cloth interior, sunroof, tape/CD/AM/FM 6 speaker stereo, ABS, traction control and side impact air bags.  Which was just delivered.  I was called at 10:30 am and drove it off the lot that night at 7pm.  Saturn has been real good about getting the add ons that I wanted, including the trailer hitch (2,500 pounds towing capacity), and the cargo window shade cover.  The base price came to $25,070, and after window etching (theft deterrent), tax, tags, title, destination, and the 5 year service plan (all oil changes, tire rotations, preventive maintenance, and wear and tear replacement) are all paid up for the next five years, I paid a final price of a little of $30,000.

Since I got the VUE, I have noticed some road noise, but it is not really all that bad.  There is some effect from wind, but I guess I am more sensitive since I just got out of a coupe, and I am not used to an SUV.  I have also found myself parking next to other SUV's, just to get a size comparison.  The VUE is an inch or two smaller than a Ford explorer, and a few inches bigger than Toyota's Rav4, and the Honda CRV.

If you are in the market for an SUV, I highly recommend that you test drive a VUE.  The value for the price cannot be beat.
