            Overall, I like the 2000 Ford Taurus Wagon.  For its price range, it rides well, looks acceptable,gets decent mileage, and is less noisy than previous years' models.  For purposes of this review, I will dwell on what is wrong with the 2000 Taurus Wagon.

First of all, I have a problem with the driver's headrest.  It protrudes at such an angle that it makes it impossible to sit up straight.  If the driver's back is flush against the back of the seat, his head is thrust forward by the headrest.  This is very uncomfortable.  Also, the headrest is so large, that it is very difficult for the driver to see when he turns his head to check for oncoming traffic.  The headrest obstructs the driver's vision too much, in my opinion.

Another problem with the car is difficult to explain, but I will try.  When parking head on against cement strip blocks (as some parking lots are set up), the underside of the car scrapes against the cement block.  I prefer cars where the tires are the first thing to touch the cement blocks.  The Taurus makes a disturbing scraping sound, as if something is getting crunched under the car.

I like the way the center console flips open to provide drink holders, etc.  I do not like the fact that it will not open all the way if you have a cell phone plugged into the outlet.  You must unplug, open then replug.  This is not a major problem, just an extra nuisance.

The next major area needing improvement is the rear of the car.  My model has a windshield wiper on the back window.  Unfortunately, it only wipes about half of the rear window.  It covers an odd angle, it should be centered to provide the best view.  As the car is designed now, the entire rear hatch opens upwardly.  You have the option of only opening the glass portion, which also opens in an upward direction.  I would prefer it if the opening were split.  It would be better if the metal section opened down, and the glass section opened up.  I have already bumped my head three times on the heavy metal section when unloading the trunk.  I would also prefer it if the remote key not only unlocked the rear section, but also popped the glass section open.  When my hands are full, it is awkward to unlock, then bend over and press the button on the car, then pull open the window.

The 2000 Taurus Wagon is basically a good car.  I do not think it would take a lot of money to make these improvements, just some common sense.
