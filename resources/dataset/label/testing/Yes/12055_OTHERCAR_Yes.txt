            For a good time call this number: S2000. Honda engineers say they use five decades of racing experience to design somthing fun to drive.  We think they design it to show off.  The S2000 has racing speed, race-inspired almunium pedals and racer-derived &quot;engine start&quot; button, plus electric steering, AC, crusie control, a CD player, leather seats and power windows, top and door locks.  The digital instrument gauges come from F1 racing.  The monocoque body and &quot;X-bone&quot; frame withg roll bars make a strong, still, safe car that gives you the feeling that your vital parts are proteted-unusual in an open top vehicle.  the price: about $32,000.<br><br>
