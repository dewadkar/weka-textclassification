            If you would have told me 10 years ago I would be driving a 4 door family type car, I would have laughed!  But, here I am, sporting a 1998 Ford Taurus SE.  I really like this car.  It has a nice ride, and it has a safe solid feel to it.  I have always driven small sporty cars until now.  I had to switch because my kids are getting older and my small car just became too cramped.  

There's plenty of room in both the front and back.  I have had adults in the back seat and the leg room is great.  I like the automatic seat adjuster on the driver's side as my husband drives my car sometimes, so he needs more leg room.  The driver's side window has a quick touch electric window which rolls down without having to hold down the button.  The radio, heat, a/c controls are very conveniently located on the dash.  The controls are simplified and not difficult to manipulate when driving.  I wish they looked a little cooler (sportier), but they are very practical in placement.  

It took me a little while to get use to the steeper front window (similar to the Chrysler design) as it was hard to judge distance in front of the car at times, but now I don't have a problem.  I especially like the remote automatic locks and panic button on my remote.  I can open the car for the kids when I am still locking my front door, so they are in and ready to go when I am!  

I originally purchased this car as we couldn't afford most of the cars I wanted.  I was only going to keep it for a couple of years and then sell when we could afford something more expensive.  All in all, this car has been a really pleasant surprise, and I plan on keeping it for a long time.<br><br>
