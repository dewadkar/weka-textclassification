            I needed a vehicle to deliver safety and reliability with a cost that I can live with.  For 9 years I have depended on this true 4 X 4 for: travelling to cross country ski races and hockey games (all over Alberta), pulling my sailboat, trailer,skidoo, track setting equipment, getting to work in rural Alberta, and driving through snowstorms to the most rugged terrain imaginable.  

I spent nearly 2 years searching dealers to find the right options at a price that was fair.  I wanted a true full time 4 X 4 that only the Jeep Selectrac can deliver.  If you buy a Jeep with commandtrac then you will have the same 4 X 4 experience as the rest of the sport utility market, which may  or may not suit your needs.  I have learned to drive and demand the control that is achieved from the select trac system.  One only needs to fly off a deserted highway on ice at -30 to appreciate the control and reliability achieved by such a full- time system.  I will own no other.  The pulling capacity is incredible for such a small utility that is truly the workhorse of the decade.  The 4.0 litre powerplant is as efficient with 20- 30 mpg consistent with demands and terrain.

The interior is small but appropriate for 4 adults and well packed gear. The parts are very moderately priced which is great because chances of picking any up  any at the autowreckers are slim and rare. I have replaced the exhaust system 3 times and the 1st time was 3 month's into my new ownership. According to the mechanics,  &quot;Jeep installed a cheap exhaust on the new one's ......&quot;,  but you can get a lifetime warranty on a new muffler after the original one goes.  I was steamed, after spending $32,000 +  on a vehicle, then later having to fork out more for a new exhaust &amp; muffler! Geez bad marketing.  The rest of the vehicle held out exceptionally for the next 7 years unti then I had to spend a small wad of cash to keep her up to greatshape. Wow great paint for almost 10 years, lots of chips but still no rust, this was the first vehicle I have not had to worry about rust.

It will be tough to find a dealer that are really knowledgeable about servicing them as well as excellent maintenance.  Find a mechanic that drives one, especially off road, and even better if they race them.


I have had great performance for 180,000 k on my 1991 Cherokee Sport with plans to buy another one when I can afford it.  So read more of my reviews!   <br><br>
