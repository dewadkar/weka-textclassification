            We purchased a used 1994 Saturn SL2 with all the bells and whistles for about 9,000 and we have loved it.  The car has needed very as far as repairs.  We have owned it for 4 years now and all that we have had to do is replace a belt, spark plugs and a water pump.  Other than that it has been regular maintenance.  I love the 4 door sedan.  With two children it makes it easy to load and unload.  The trunk is a nice size and you can achieve more room by folding one or both of the back seats down.  It has a nice design and it has remained stylish.  The controls are in good places, although, it took me a while to get used to having the window controls on the console instead of the door.  After getting used to it, I like it better.  Overall, we have been very happy with our purchase.<br><br>
