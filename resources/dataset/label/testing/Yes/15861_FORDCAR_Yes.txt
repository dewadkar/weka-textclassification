            This is my 3rd ford pickup truck I like the body style mine is a 1997  f250 4x4 Ext cab heavy duty and how they handle.

I love this truck my daughter and I were involved in a multiple car accident with this truck at 45 miles per hour and it drove away a young girl pull out from a stop sign and broad sided me an then I hit a car head on I am thankful that we were in that truck and not in a car.
I love the horse power that it has under the hood it has a 460.
We have owned this truck for a little over 2 1/2 years now and it is picking up some rattles but that is part of owning a heavy duty truck.
So there is nothing I really hate about this truck.

What is it like to drive it is a very comfortable truck to drive the controls are driver friendly We have upgraded the sound system to an Eclipse 7001 source system with a 6 disc changer and a vcr for watching movies for the little one. It does have a stiff ride to it but not bad 
we have the 3 way sitting up front and the back seat is not bad to sit in.
It handles very well in the snow and ice for we live in the mountains it handles curves nicely with not much sway from it.
Who should buy this is anyone who wants a great truck and want to feel safe.
Who should not that is for them to decide not me
