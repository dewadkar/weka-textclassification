            Time does not stand still and with every passing second my 9 year anniversary was fast approaching.  What to do? Every year I try to
surprise the love of my life.  Yup, you got it.  I rented her a
BMW &quot;M&quot; Roadster for a day.  In Minneapolis, Minnesota a local outfit, Power Trips (www.power-trips.com), rents premium autos.  With the magic of plastic I was heading home. My first impression was &quot;Wunderbar&quot;.  The roadster was a dark green with black leather interior. The 3.2 liter 6 cylinder engine was incredible responsive.  0 to 60 in 5.2 seconds. Road handling was phenomenal.  Heads were turning, smiles were appearing at every corner on the way home.  Did I say mouths a flapping?  Yup, the neighbors were all drooling as I pulled into my drive way.  My wife stared in disbelieve as I got and announce her chariot await her.  Off for supper with a scenic drive along the Mississippi River.  If you are looking for a seriously fun two seater, the &quot;M&quot; Roadster should be at the top of you list.  Now what to do next year? <br><br>
