            We leased a 1999 XLT Expedition for our 4 kids &quot;blended&quot; family. Having owned Fords for a number of years and knowing better than to get a first year model, I felt confident. We have almost every available option, the sticker was $38,500.00. It seemed perfect, 3 seats, plenty of room for the kids and their friends,all wheel drive and anti-lock brakes. The perfect family SUV, right?
It has been plagued with electrical problems from the beginning. Not enough to make it unreliable, just hassles. The &quot;smart stick&quot; (turn signals and wipers) has already been replaced once and needs it again. If you turn on the left turn signal, sometimes you get the windshield wipers.The rear wiper function works only when it wants and that is infrequent. One of the seat belt holders just fell apart, glad there was no one in it in an accident. It has also dropped one of the cylinders because of a coolant leak shorting out the new spark plug design.
Ours now is one year old with only 10,500 miles. I like the vehicle overall in its design and features, but don't like the gremlins. I know other people who have had the same problems with the electrical products on their 1999 Expedition. If you are thinking of buying, I recommend getting an extended warranty if you plan to keep the vehicle.<br><br>
