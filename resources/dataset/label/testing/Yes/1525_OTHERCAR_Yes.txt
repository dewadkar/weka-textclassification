            I bought my Saturn for several reasons. One was that my parents have had two of them now and I knew they were good, inexpensive cars. More important, tho, was that I was making very little money and my existing car had no brakes... I needed something new, and soon. I swung by the local Saturn dealership, intending to just look around. I ended up getting an SL... and yes, it was just like the hokey ads &quot;and this is [his] first new car.&quot; 

Now it's been 4 years and the car still runs very well. I had to replace the brake pads after less than 20,000 miles - apparently GM uses some *very* cheap pads out of the factory. Once we got past that, I've had nothing but routine maintenance (oil changes and the like). My car and I have been over 100,000 miles now and it still handles like it's a part of me - and I drive hard. First off, I live in Boston, so a &quot;merge&quot; sign is seen more as a challenge than an advisory. Hard braking, harder acceleration and sudden turns are quite normal for me. The car gives me no problems with this. Of course, driving like this, you do see some accidents... but I don't feel unsteady despite having such a small car. I've seen a really bad accident involving a Saturn where the driver walked away; I know I'll be fine inside here. 

With gas prices being what they are, it's nice knowing that I can fill up for $15 and still go 350 miles before handing over any more money. The biggest downside to this car is that I barely fit in it - I'm about 6' 3&quot; and the driver's seat, put fully back, is just barely able to give enough leg room. The plastic side panels also tend to show scratches from shopping carts a little more easily than their metal counterparts. 

Overall, if you're looking for a quality car... especially for, say, you 16 year old kid who just got their license... this is definitely the way to go. <br><br>
