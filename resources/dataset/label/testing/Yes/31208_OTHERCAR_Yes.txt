            My approach to this review is one of feelings and impressions versus technical knowledge.  Anyone can take an adventure to the Jeep homepage (www.jeep.com) and lookup any and all technical mumbo jumbo one might want.  As a Liberty owner, I wanted to just let you know want I think of it in simple terms.

The new Jeep Liberty is quite a change from the existing line up of jeeps and the now retired Jeep it replaced.  Most people's first impression of the little, but rather overweight, Jeep is..."Cute!"  It has been referred to as a "Cute-Ute", by many a friend of mine, which is why it appeals to the more feminine drivers out there.

The new Liberty may have a cute appearance, but it can still get down and dirty with the rest of the boys on the playground. With a rather peppy 3.7L V6 the new Jeep is by no means the quickest people mover on the road. The engine is more than enough to propel its sometimes 4000lb body up and down the road with relative ease and mobility. Whether passing cars on the highway or lumbering around the metropolis of our modern cities, the Liberty has the power to go wherever you could want.

Heck, if you are a male driver who likes to slam the pedal and roar out load as your vehicle yells in return then take the Jeep for a test drive.  Start going around a corner and stomp on it��then grin! 

NOTE:  Do not do this in the presence of police officers, small children, animals and most importantly�.your wife.

The turning radius is astounding and makes maneuvering this guy around a mall parking lot effortless. This SUV turns as well if not better than my Honda Civic did which I owned before the Liberty. I have bounded up and down some pretty good mountains already in the Jeep and it does as well there as it does making an ungodly trip through the chaos known as a Wal-Mart parking lot (Shoppers know exactly what I mean!).

The stereo is quite pleasing to the senses, especially if you purchase the infinity speaker package with the built in CD player and tape deck. Volume is by no means ear bleeding but it is more than enough to compensate for the elevated noise levels when careening down the interstate at higher speeds.

Hey! It has to be a Jeep, the lights are round!!!

One of my few complaints about the Liberty is in the department of stopping. With its 4000lb body weight the Jeep can be a bit hesitant to stop as quickly as you might want it to. It does the job of coming to halt in only a modestly average manner. Under the rare cases where one has to lock up the breaks and start praying to whatever God they choose, you will stop before meeting the guy upstairs but there is just a split second where you wonder if you won�t.

The only other item that took some getting used to was the window controls. They are located on the center armrest/storage. For the first few days you will go to roll the window down or up and find you are locking and unlocking your vehicle. Once you get used to their location, like anything else it will become second nature to you.

The new automatic rear hatch window makes life a bit easier when you just want to put things in and out of the rear without opening the whole thing up. The side swinging gate allows the Jeep to be loaded easily in a parking lot or whatever environment that you are in at the time. The butt of this little Jeep looks extremely small like its missing half a cheek but don�t let appearances fool you. There is a surprising bit of room in the back of it and the grocery hooks make it simple to store those items purchased.

Living in the snowy state of Colorado I find the selec-trac  4 wheel drive to be worth its weight in gold. Whether ice or snow, the Liberty can pummel its way through about anything Mother Nature has to offer. Do be careful on ice though, 4000lbs takes a bit more to get used to than does a 2000lb compact. With 9 inches of clearance, decent tires and 210 HP I have yet to find a snow drift on the road that didn�t succumb to my whims.

So whether you are a mom on the go with kids who needs to whip in and out of places all day long or if you are a male who wants to terrorize the mountains, enjoy! I would highly recommend this new Jeep to any and everyone out there who is thinking of purchasing a new SUV. At least give it the time for a test drive, you might be very pleasantly surprised.
