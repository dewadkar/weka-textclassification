            I recently decided to take a trip to my local Mitsubishi dealership and test drive the new 2000 Eclipse.  I saw an ad on TV a couple times and the APR they were presently offering was impressive.  When I got there, they explained that the financing currently being offered was 0.9% for 36 months or 1.9% for 60 months.  Both offers where very impressive.  Here's what I thought of the actual car once I drove it:

<b>Engine</b>
Since the Eclipse is technically a sports car, lets begin this review by talking about the engine.  For my test drive, I decided to go with the most expensive (and fastest) Eclipse that is offered, the GT.  The GT comes with a V6, 205 hp engine.  The lower models of the Eclipse come with a V4 and about 170 hp.  (Although i'm not 100% positive and the hp on the lower models)  The extra three to four thousand that you will pay for the GT is definitly worth it in my opinion just because of the engine.  The Eclipse GT does not hesitate at all from stop to go.  While test driving the vehicle, I redlined it at 7000 rpms in each gear and the acceleration was smooth.  The car is reported to do 0-60 in 6.9 sec but it did seem faster then that while I was driving it.  (I test drove a manual)  

The new Eclipse handles well into the corners.  The tires did not screech even though I did take some corners at a high rate of speed.  

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of the new Eclipse definitly has a sportscar feel to it.  The vents for heat and AC are round.  The seats are lowered and the radio takes some getting used to.  The control panel for the radio is located high (up near the windshield), while the radio sits lower.  (near the shifter.)  This is odd at first but i'm sure you get used to it.  I guess the reason behind Mitsubishi's idea is for drivers to take your eyes off the road less.  

The tachometer and speedometer have a silver background but glow orange at night.  The temp. and gas gauge are enclosed in their seperate circular areas.  The front seats are comfortable, while the backseats are crowded, especially for long rides.  The truck is small but is to be expected from a sportscar.  The standard radio on the GT comes with a 7 speaker (2 front, 2 rear, 2 tweeters, and a center) that sounds nice but is not a premium stereo system by any means.  An in-dash CD player is also standard.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior of the newly designed 2000 Eclipse is similar to the older models in some ways.  The doors have a weird wave through them although it does make the car unique.  The model I drove of the GT had fog lights and a rear spoiler which &quot;made the car&quot; in my opinion.  The GT comes with 17&quot; alloy rims  which are very nice.

<b>Reliability</b>
The older Eclipse's have been known to have problems with reliabilty in the past.  Because of this, i'm not sure if i'd actually purchase a new one until some more info comes out on the reliability of them.  While at the dealership, I asked the salesman what he thought of the problems of the older Eclipse's.  He explained to me that the newer Eclipse's are supposed to address the reliability problems because the new GT is designed with a V6 instead of a turbocharged V4.  He said, therefore its less &quot;wear and tear&quot; on the engine.  This explaination sounds good to me, but i'm not exactly an expert on cars and engines so I couldn't tell if he was pulling my leg.  (If someone knows, please comment below)

<b>Price</b>
The GT model's sticker price is around $20500.  The model I drove was an additional $700 because of the spoiler.  Because of Mitsubishi's desire to become a well known (and popular) car dealer in the United States, these prices are obviously negotiable.  <br><br>
