            I wanted a digital camera, but I really couldn't afford a good one. I saw a deal on the web for a polaroid 15 exposure camera.. figured it was good enough for what I wanted to try. Plus, polaroid is a well known name in cameras, I have had a few in the past and had no complaints.

The camera itself is small, big enough to fit into a purse. It holds 4 AAA batteries. Battery life is pretty good, I've had the camera for 6 months and had to replace them once... well once that they died in. 

The pictures it takes are fairly good,  will be happy to send some if you want to see the quality. Nothing special though. 

Cons: 
As I said in the brief, the battery tab pops open ALL THE TIME. I currently have it taped shut with a small bit of packing tape. The lock really a miserable excuse. 

The other bad thing is there isn't a flash. This means that low light shots can just be forgotten- nothing comes out. Sunny days are great, inside shots with lots of light are fine, but really I would recommend outdoor use primarily. Also in low light you have to hold still longer for the better shot.

The camera doesn't have a view screen, so you don't know how the shots will turn out until you download them. The software that comes with the camera is easy to use, and deleting photos is fine as well. You can delete photos as well without downloading them, and there is an automatic time off so if you have the camera on but don't use it for about 2 minutes it shuts off. 

Overall and for the price, its a decent camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to check out digital photography without spending a lot of money, or for those who just need a camera for ebay or so forth. My mother has borrowed it for school a few times as well, and since it was under $50, I don't really care if some fifth grader chucks it in the toilet. You know how some fifth graders can be.
