            First thing that is important for my situation is that I am only 21.

I was in the market for a new car. I did not have a car when I bought this one. I was sick and tired of old used cars and I decided to buy a new one! I first looked around on the internet for weeks (while saving money) for a car that I wanted. I first wanted a Chrysler P.T. Cruiser but the $1000 deposit and 1 YEAR waiting period was not an option.

I went to a Mitsubishi Dealership to look around. A salesman was very quick to point out their TOP of the line Eclipse for only $26,000 which I told him that I did not want but he insisted I drive it, so I did and ok, not bad. I asked for a quote on how much the eclipse would cost me and after a hour of BS they told me to leave since my credit was not up to par on their part. So I left smiling, it just reinforced my thoughts about car dealerships.

Then I went to Saturn and my thoughts all changed. First of all I picked out the car I wanted 2001 SC2 and told them I want it with no money down and see what they can do. I filled out a credit application and went home. After several days they told me that the credit company would not finance me alone on the car, ( duh! ) but they said they would if I had a co-signer. I got one and a week after I went to the dealership I drove away in my brand new 2001 Saturn with only 12 miles on the odometer.

I LOVE THIS CAR! It is very fun to drive, excellent steering input, good acceleration and great fuel economy. The sound system is excellent with a CD/Radio combination. The leather seats inside are very comfortable and look great. People are amazed I tell them how much I paid $17,800. They think it should cost at least $25,000 or more. All I do is smile.

The only annoying thing is that the gas tank is only about 11 gallons which gives me about 320 miles between fill-ups but as I drive around 80 miles a day (work) I need to fill up every 3 to 4 days or so. It takes regular which is nice unlike the Eclipse which took Premium.

The car itself is Black with Grey leather interior which makes me wash the car a LOT because black get dirty real fast, but it looks oh so nice when I'm done. Yes I pamper my car because if you treat your car well, it will treat you well. 

The brakes on the car are excellent, although I did not take ABS which I despise, with great stopping power. The inside noise of the car when driving at highway speeds ( 90+ *grins* ) do become noticeable if I ever turned the radio down, which I do not.

The cars ability to steer and handle is excellent. It responds very fast to emergency lane changes with very little roll as it should since it is a sports car. The car has slight understeer at high speeds but it is easily correctable and not noticeable unless you know what to look for. 

The third door on the drivers side is a GREAT idea. I use it all the time to get people in the back so I don't have to constantly adjust my seat. It just makes it easier to get in the back which everyone appreciates, and it looks cool also.

Overall I would rate this car as PERFECT for the money it costs!<br><br>
