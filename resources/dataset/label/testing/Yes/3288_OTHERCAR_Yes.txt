            I don't own a Saab 9000 but I considered one for quite a while.  I have also driven over 6000 miles on my friend's 9000 turbo while touring all over the country. 

It was very roomy, both front and back, while the 4-door hatchback design allowed for cargo storage and sleeping space! The seats, while worn, were quite comfortable.  

There was adequate headroom and legroom for both of us...a 5'8" guy and a 6'2" guy.

This car is quite fast...driven well, it will hit 135, where the speedometer pegs.  It also gets good mileage...about 27 miles per gallon averaging 75 mph.  

Build quality both inside and out seems to be fairly high.

The quirks one has to overcome to love a Saab:
The transmission is blocky...like shifting a transmission made of stone.  Not fun and very easy to grind gears.  Shifting slowly is easy but that's not my driving style.

The electrical system is very weird.  In parts of the country where it was very humid, the sunroof stopped working.  Various electrical devices did not work, including some of the electric door lock system.  

Service is expensive on these buggers, but oddly enough, the parts are not.  Dedicated and experienced Saab mechanics are hard to find and thusly expensive.
