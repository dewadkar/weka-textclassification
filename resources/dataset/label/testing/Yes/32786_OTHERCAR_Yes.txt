            I've always loved sports cars, and have owned several--German, Japanese, and American.  The Corvette was a car that always intrigued, but never owned one until 6 months ago.  I bought used in mint condition, good price--a '00 Torch Red Hardtop, 6 speed, loaded.  For those concerned about reliability, mine had 34k when I purchased, and now is at 40k--rock solid, no rattles, no oil consumption, etc.  It is as or more solid as any car I've owned.  GM engineered this car well.

Enough about esoterics.  The performance of the Vette is amazing.  In any gear, even in 6th gear while cruising, the car pulls hard.  In lower gears it feels like someone is pushing you in the back as the car vaults forward.  I was wary about getting a manual since I drive in the city; however, the engine power is flexible enough that I can put it in 4th and roll with traffic from 25mph to highway speeds.  The handling is amazing, no body roll and great grip.  My guess is the Vette is designed to handle a level of performance driving that is above the average drivers ability to fully use on the street.  

Interior wise, I'm happy with the leather, sound system, and interior components/materials.  Sure it could be more luxurious, but considering the price point--no complaints.  This is a performance, not a luxury car.  The 4 speaker Bose system sounds great when playing CDs and radio for those who value that sort of thing.  

The ride is firm, and with the Z51 sport suspension (standard on the hardtop), you will feel the bumps.  Most sports cars have bumpy rides on bad roads, so the Vette is well within the norm for a sports car.  No creaks and rattles in the time I've owned.  My Vette has the OEM runflat tires (no spare, can travel quite a distance on a flat tire).  The stiff sidewall of runflat tires create more road noise than conventional tires, but I like the security of knowing that I'll not have to repair a flat on the side of the road--my understanding is 200 miles at 55mph on a flat before the tire gives out.

Well, you can tell that I'm happy with my Vette.  This isn't a car to buy if you don't like attention--especially in red!
