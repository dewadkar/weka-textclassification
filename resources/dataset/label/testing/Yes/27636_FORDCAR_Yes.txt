            I have a 2002 Ford Escape with a 3.0 liter Duratec engine that I really like. It's quick, nimble and handles well in all weather. The interior is a little cheap looking and plastic parts come flying off all the time. One other problem I have become aware of that Ford just released is what is referred to by Ford service as "Intermittent Engine Quit or Idle Dip". No recall has been issued at this point - the customer needs to complain of the problem in order for it to be repaired. This problem occurs at highway speed (45 - 55 MPH)and causes a loss of all power and power steering. Obviously, loss of all power at these speeds could lead to tragedy and Ford is playing with dynamite by not recalling these models and proactively replacing the throttle bodies, control modules and related items outlined in the service bulletin. The reason they don't is probably cost - could be over $1,000 for all parts and labor. I personally know of 4 Escape owners who have had this stalling problem and each of them has a harrowing tale of narrowly missing accidents with the complete loss of power. The service bulletin was issued on 6/3/02 under article number 02-11-6 under "driveability problems" and covers all 2001-2002 Escape models equipped with the 3.0 liter Duratec engine. Before you buy one of these 2001 or 2002 vehicles new or used, check this out - it could save your life.
