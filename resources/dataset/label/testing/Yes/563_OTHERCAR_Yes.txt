            I would like to start by mentioning that I do not own a Hyundai Accent.  However, I did recently rent one for
two days and learned enough about the car to offer my observations.   This model represents the 19.95 cheapo, bottom of the rung economy rental for Dollar Auto Rental.  When I arrived at the counter, the clerk immediately tried to sell me on an upgrade to a Chrysler Concord.  She explained that many people upgrade because they perceive Korean cars as cheaply made and tinny.  Due to the fact that I was not born yesterday, I decided to pass on her offer and rent the Hyundai anyway.  It sounded like a classic bait and switch tactic to me!.  Anyway, this was my first time ever driving a Korean car and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  Although the car is very blandly styled, it is solidly built, and pretty comfortable.  I drove it both around town and on the interstate and it performed flawlessly in both instances.  No creaks, no squeeks.  Just a no frills, well built economy car. One area that did disappoint me a bit was the gas mileage.  Although I did not measure the exact mpg,  I was disappointed to go from a full tank to approximately 1/4 full after driving only 160 miles - on the highway.. I was also a little surprised to see the price hovering around 9k and change for this model.  This is a pretty nice car,  but it needs to steer well clear of the price range of such other models as the Chevy Prism and Maza Protege which I suspect would clean this little Korean models clock.  If they can keep the price, say about 2K below the nearest Japanese competitor, this Hyundai is worth a look.  However, even at that price, they still have to go up against the slightly used Japanese car market..
