            I've always had a soft spot for Mazda's and was thrilled when I heard about this car. As soon as it came out I had to go to the dealership right away to test drive one. I sampled an automatic 4-cyl. without any extra options.

<b>Engine</b>
The 4-cyl. 160 horsepower engine is not bad by any means considering it is a 4-cyl after all. Especially since it starts at $20,000, the engine is adequate when you consider that an "entry-level" Mercedes-Benz C240 Sedan comes standard with 168 horsepower at a price tag over $10,000 greater than the 6. Since I have driven several 4-cyl. automobiles, including Mazdas, I was very surprised to find out just how quiet the engine was thanks to the larger displacement. On the highway the engine was strong and confident as it provided adequate passing power. Do not consider the peppy 4-cyl. to be a punishment for not spending the extra bucks. It should be enough for your daily travels unless you are looking to race from stoplight to stoplight.

<b>Design</b> 
Since this is a subjective matter, it is best for you to decide what you think of it. It definitely has sportier curves to it when compared to the Accord's and Camry's of the family sedan universe. I feel that the interior is a bold display of ingenuity that I personally enjoyed. After sitting in the Mazda, I almost wanted to throw up at the staleness of the 2002 Toyota Camry LE's interior that I rented a week later. My only complaint to Mazda is that the 4-cyl. comes with plastic covers. I would expect to get more with my $20,000 but I guess Mazda had to find some way to keep costs down. 

<b>Handling</b>
You simply won't find a better handling car for $5,000 more than what the Mazda 6 costs. After the first time you find some winding country roads in the 6, you'll succumb to the pure joy that is the 6's handling and this driving euphoria might just make you delirious enough to believe that you are driving a BMW 325i. However you don't have to be that delirious to believe that the handling is straight out of a BMW because the handling characteristics between the two are so similar.

<b>Comfort</b>
Front seat passengers will be treated to comfortably bolstered seats. The main complaint will come from those trapped in the backseat. The backseat room is quite small compared to the likes of the Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. The 6's rear legroom would be considered "good" if it competed against econo-boxes. Another complaint of mine would be the lack of rear headrests. Not only would it look classier but it is also safer as it helps to prevent whiplash in an accident. 

<b>Final Word</b>
The Mazda 6 is a solid car that improves greatly upon the Mazda 626. It is a fine choice that should not be overlooked if shopping for a mid-size sedan. Compared to it's competition I would only recommend the Nissan Altima over it. If you prefer four doors but normally drive with only one or two passengers than this is a terrific car as it is both functional yet pleasing to drive. If you need the backseat room to fit bodies, than I would look elsewhere.
