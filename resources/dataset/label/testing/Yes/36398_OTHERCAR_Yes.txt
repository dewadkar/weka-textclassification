            My husband and I just bought a new 2001 Dodge Dakota club cab and we love it. It's white with grey on the bottom. This was the color we preferred but any color in this truck looks good.

 Ours is the Dakota Club Cab SLT so it has everything you need in a truck. The interior is so classy looking instead of just plain like some other trucks we looked at. Our favorite feature is the smooth ride. And having a next generation magnum V8 engine in a mid size truck is perfect for towing and just having enough power for everyday driving. 

It's features include roomy dark grey interior with dual airbags with the option to turn off the passenger airbag, cup holders that adjust to fit big and small cups(they thought of everything),AM/FM Tape/CD player with 8 infinity speakers in 6 locations that sound great, 3 button access to garage door openers or inside lights, a tow package and a full size spare. Our model came with 16 inch rims but I think they vary from one model Dakota to the next. 

I would recommend this truck to anyone looking for the versatility of a truck but the luxury of a car. This truck has it all. With the roomy interior, classy look and great features this truck is great for any drivers. And I can't forget to mention the built in driving lights. Any time we drive at night we use those driving lights they are so bright and they really look cool on too.  <br><br>
