               I bought a Toyota 4 runner a year ago, and I am still pleased to drive it every day. I bought the limited version, which means it includes more features, of course the price was about 4 thousand more. I still think it's worth it though. The 4 runner is a quick car and pulls my boat, a 17 footer without any problems. The interior is great and gives a lot of head room in both the front seats and back. My kids love the car because we have driven it a lot in the snow. We have NEVER ever gotten stuck in the snow. THis is the number one reason why I bought it. This car is comparable to the jeep grand cherokke but has a better look to it, I think. IF you want to compare the 4 runner vs. the Jeep Grand cherokee, go to www.jeep.com and investigate. It has a 18 gallon fuel tank. THe mpg is alright, I average about 16 mpg. The Car has 15 thosand miles on it and hasn't had a problem. If you want a reliable SUV, enjoy with the 4 runner. Hopefully you will enjoy it has much as I am, if you buy it, the dream machine!<br><br>
