            I have used many digital cameras; Sony, Olympus, Kodak... Although I love the Sony cameras with the floppy disks, I use the Olympus D-600L all the time when I am working on my G3 for the newspaper. Transferring the highest resolution images are slow and occasionally finicky, but oh, the quality is to die for!
Ease-of-use is an important feature, as digital cameras move out of the niche market and into mainstream consumer culture, and this camera is as easy to use as flicking a switch and pressing a button. The LCD viewscreen on the back provides a generally accurate perception of the final image, and the zoom feature is fast and accurate.
Images are a picture of perfection. They need almost no retouching before being put to use, and they are sharp and bright. The camera is easy to hold since the camera fits the contours of the human hand, and it simply looks high-tech.
Definately a reccomended camera for the beginner or professional. At this price it is a great bargain.<br><br>
