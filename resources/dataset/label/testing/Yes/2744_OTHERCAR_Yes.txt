            I bought the truck new in July 94, it has always had good power. Cruise control maintains speed going uphill in southern missouri, loaded and pulling a motorcycle trailer with three bikes on it. It currently has 96K miles on it and still seems to run good. On long trips the seats remain comfortable. I added a hard tonnaeu cover which cut down on the amount of storage in the bed but made it pretty secure. The cover didn't seem to help gas mileage but did seem to help traction in wet and snow a little. I wish I had gotten the extend cab, but this one was the only one available with the V6 and manual tranny at the time and I was under a time crunch. The heat and AC has always been very good. It does have the new type of coolant for the AC. The V6 in mine is not the Vortec.

I only have a couple of minor complaints about the truck. The passenger side visor vanity mirror lights shorted out and killed the battery. It took the dealership a couple of trips to figure it out and fix it. They replaced the visor and battery under warranty. All three of the visors have had an elastic strap to hold papers and such. All three stretched and sagged in short order, I cut them off.

The windshield wiper motor/controller on a lot of Chevy's have problems. They will intermittantly not work at all. I troubleshot mine to a bad solder joint on the controller at the plug and reflowed the solder. I've never had a problem with it since. The company I work for uses S-10's in their fleet and all have had the same wiper problem. Dealer charges $80 - $100 to replace with no guarantee that the new one won't develop the same problem.  All the company vehicles are 4 cylinder, with about half automatics. All the automatics have had multiple tranny problems. And several trucks have had head gasket problems, though not until well over 100k. My company truck (97) just came out of the shop for a bad head gasket, it has 166K. Cost $550, mostly labor, just $67 in parts. I know that at least on somethings we get a fleet discount so not sure if these numbers are typical.
