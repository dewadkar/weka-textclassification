            We bought this vehicle because we were in need of a new minivan after our last one &quot;died.&quot; We didn't expect some of the fine luxuries though. There was a GPS system inside and had a map of the U.S. You just had to enter an address and it would tell you what route to take and an estimated amount of time that it would take to get there. It doesn't have all the roads but it has about 90% of them. It even has a point of interest option. The driving might as well be automatic. It's so easy to handle and goes exactly where you want it to. All the functions were easy to figure out. The trunk is a drawback though. It is very small and deep so you have to stack things on top of each other. Another disappointing feature is the automatic sliding doors. Yes sure they open automaticaly when you pull the handle but a lot of times it gets stuck or doesn't work properly. The door has a safety feature though that stops when a hand or a body is in the way. The seats are comfortable and all of them can lean back except the back row. There are cup holders on each side in the back seats. There is a fold up table between the driver and the passenger which contains four cup holders. There is a coin case that comes out when you pull. You can get a CD player and radio but no tape player. Overall this car is very good.<br><br>
