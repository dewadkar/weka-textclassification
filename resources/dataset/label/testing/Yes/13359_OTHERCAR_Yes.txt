            My grandfather had given me his 1983 CHEVROLET CAPRICE CLASSIC when I was 14 I am 18 now, I loved it, it was a big car and it was not a new body style. I love the room and comfort, the ride of it is awesome, it seems to float going down the road. I am graduating this year and my parents offered to buy me a new vehicle, but I said I would drive my CHEVY CAPRICE until it died on me, which probably won't happen any time soon, it ha over 265,000 miles on it when my ORIGINAL speedometer cable broke on me and I just never felt like replacing it. Anyone looking for a great car that will last them years on end should purchase a CHEVY CAPRICE or any CHEVY!! The only other vehicle I have ever driven was a ford ranger and I replaced everything with CHEVY parts that was ford except for the frame and body, but I did cut the body a little. It was used strictly for racing. I have also raced my CHEVY CAPRICE and had fun doing it, it has a 305 4bbl with an automatic trans. I ran 11.21 in the 1/8 and 17.89 in the 1/4.<br><br>
