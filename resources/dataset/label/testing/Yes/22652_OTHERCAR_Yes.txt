            I purchased my TDI after a very disapointing experience with a '98 Dodge Dakota, which Chrysler bought back at 34K miles.

The reason I bought the TDI was basically on recommendations from a few friends that had VW diesels with extroadinarily high mileage.  After the &quot;Dodge&quot; experience, I was looking for a reliable vehicle, PERIOD, and the VW looked like it might fit the bill.

The dealer experience was excellent;  no high pressure, no arguing over price, etc.  The price quoted was $18,800, including the set of options I wanted;  not a dollar less, not a dollar more, no haggling, no high pressure bull.

Now I've been driving it for over 10K miles, and am liking this car more and more each day.  I never had any problems with starting during the zero degree weather we had this past winter, although it does take about 30 seconds for the glow plugs to heat up at this low outside temperature.  No problems getting diesel fuel either.  Once started, it warms up rather slowly (about 5 miles until up to normal temperature), but you start getting heat after a few minutes.

The car is solid as a rock, and has very good accelleration.  It has been back to the dealer twice, for scheduled services, and they are prompt, efficient, and they even wash and vacuum it for you when they're done!  Nice touch!!

I'm getting around 48MPG in combined driving.  That's about 700mi from a tank of fuel.  The only thing I will comment on is that when you go for fuel, you must watch the gas jockey closely, or they will pump you full of regular gas instead of diesel fuel, which, of course, will totally trash your engine.  And it is somewhat noisier than a gas engine, but you can't get something for nothing.  But don't get the Monsoon stereo - it sucks.<br><br>
