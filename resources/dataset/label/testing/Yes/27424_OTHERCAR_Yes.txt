            I bought my neon because it was affordable and based on the enormously popular dodge shadow series.  The Neon has considerable power right out of the box and doesn't lose any in the following years.  My Neon is over 5 years old now; it was one of the first ever produced.  My car has been in 5 accidents and suffered over $10,000 in damage and it's still running strong.  I'm completely happy with my Neon- It is a tank among sub-compacts.  My Neon has been everywhere from the beach to the mountains.  As a mountain bike racer, I demand a lot from my vehicles and the Neon has stacked up.  Since my vehicle has been produced only innovations and improvements have occurred.<br><br>
