            I chose this camera because of its superior quality relative to its price.  I used the camera this basketball season to take pictures of the games and then to post them to the team website.  The camera worked great for this.  I also took a picture of the moon through my telescope and I now use that picture for the wallpaper on my computer.  The only drawback to the camera is the amount of batteries that it consumes during its operation.  This camera is a good buy for the casual photographer, however, a more professional photographer should consider a better equipped camera.  This camera has no zoom capability.<br><br>
