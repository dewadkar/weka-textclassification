            I bought my Accent new a couple years ago.  I work part time, so I was looking for something in the 10grand price range.  And the Accent was perfect.  Mine is a 1.5 SOHC 5 speed manual.

My Accent runs super quiet.  I run it longer than I should between oil changes, and I haven't had a problem with it yet.  Nothing.  A couple oil changes and a set of windshield wipers is about all I've done to it.  And I've been getting great gas mileage out of it.  Which is key considering the price of gas these days (and to think, I was looking at used Cherokees).

It's not the most powerful car, but the car will roll for you.  I've got 5 points and a $200+ speeding ticket (105 past a state trooper is NOT advised) to prove it.

It is a stylish little car, although the almost non-existent deck lid is a bit misleading.  And the 13" tires are sort of on the lame side (15's about as big as you can go without having to do work to the wheel well).  There's plenty of trunk room.  In fact, for a sub-compact, it's got a lot of room.  I'm a pretty big guy, and I have no problems getting in and out.  I can easily get 3 people in the back seat.

It's a great first-new-car.  It's the right price, and it'll definitely take care of it's owner.  And if anything does go wrong, there's the 10 year 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.
