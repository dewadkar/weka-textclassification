            We purchased this camera in the fall of '99. We have really enjoyed 
using it and have found it to be very user friendly. The disk going right to your computer is one of the neatest features because a disk can go anywhere that you can find computer or someone else with the Sony
type camera that also uses a disk. Its like having a photo album that is
a fraction of the size as you can store so many pictures in less space than that of one 4x6 picture. Now for the But...1.We wish that we had spent the extra money to get more zoom..2.and we found that for any type of fast moving object(like our daughter playing basketball) we could not get the quality picture we wanted. We feel that more zoom would allow us to get pictures that are just a little out of range and would allow us to get pictures with out being as obvious, thus captioning a more real 
picture. Overall we love our camera and use it a lot for web use. We just wish we would have bought the next level up!    <br><br>
