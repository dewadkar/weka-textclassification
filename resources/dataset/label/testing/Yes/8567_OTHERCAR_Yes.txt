            I own a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am.  When I first got the car, I was in shock... I thought... &quot;WOW, this is great, it handles wonderful&quot;  The Clutch was right there, no problem driving it.  I couldn't have asked for a better car.  It's sporty looking, very roomy, and definitely comfortable to drive.  You could sit for hours and drive or ride in that car.  I bought it as a used car from another owner.  It wasn't bought at a used car lot.  Unfortunately I didn't see what problems were coming.

When I asked the guy what was wrong with it, all I was told that the window was off the track on the driver side.  It has power windows.  I thought &quot;Oh no big deal&quot;  well...  the trouble started...  Not only the driver window was &quot;off the track&quot;  the track was broken....  passenger side was also &quot;off the track&quot;???  No that one was bent.  Taking the car to a body shop thinking it would be cheaper than going to a Pontiac dealership.. You can't order the parts for the windows from anywhere, EXCEPT a pontiac dealership, and Each piece costing $250.  They don't sell them without the motor with it,  but yet the power window motors were not bad on my car.  

Next the heating system, is.... well I don't know what it is...  I only have heat coming on face level, none for the floor, none for defrost...  Why would a car that's had only 1 owner and only 5 years old at the time have these problems I wondered.  

The previous owner had told me he put a new engine in the car that had only 30,000 miles on it,  well maybe I'm a female, but I didn't think to actually compare... But the car should be a V6 but it had a quad 4 in it. It makes me wonder what was wrong with the original engine?  Are these cars all they are made out to be?  Or do they have so many problems that things have to be constantly changed?  Sludge in the oil???  I have that too...  I have always had the oil changed when it should be.  

Replacing power steering units...  These are all things I've found in just this one year that I've owned it.  Is this the kind of quality a Pontiac owner is receiving?  Is this what someone who wants to buy a Pontiac Grand Am will have to look forward to?
It just makes me wonder,  was it a good buy or not?<br><br>
