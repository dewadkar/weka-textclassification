            The 2001 Jeep Cherokee is a great car to drive.  It has a smooth ride and has great handling.  It is a great first car for a teenager because its not to big, but at the same time, its not to small.  

I have three main problems with this car.  First, the leg room it the back.  I am 6'1, and there is now way I can sit back there with other people.  I have to sit at an angle so my knees arn't digging into the front seats.  

Another problem with the back seats is the a/c.  I have problems feeling the air sitting in the front seat when it is on full blast.  Then you sit in the back and you feel nothing.  It gets extremly warm and we have to crack the windows, which inturn makes the a/c usless.  Another problem with the a/c is it is so loud.  If you turn it on high, you can't have a normal conversation.

Finally, its durability.  A week after we got this car, a black stripe of molding on the rear left door started braking away.  this prevented us from using the ddoor to its full ability.  We could only open it about half way.

There are many good things about this car, but there are also some problems with it too.  I believe that those are the main three, and if you look past those, you have got yourself a great vehicle.  With the lack of back seat room, I would reccomend this car to a teenager or a couple with no kids.
