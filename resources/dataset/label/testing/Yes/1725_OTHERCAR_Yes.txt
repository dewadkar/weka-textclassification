            I've always loved sports cars, since I was in college in the 1950's. This one caught my eye when I was in the market for a relatively inexpensive, peppy, nice handling, fun 2nd car. I test drove the Del Sol and that was the end for me. I was in love. I shopped around for the best deal and bought it and have never regretted it.

I have the SI with the less powerful vortec engine, at 130 hp. The car weighs only 1900 pounds. I can't imagine why anyone would want/need the 160 hp top end engine. If I accidentally let the clutch out too fast I burn out and one can spin the drive wheels in shifts to second gear with great ease (going straight, too.) 

The car really has two personalities. Grandma's scooter is seen when you drive conservatively and shift by 3000 rpm, the enthusiast's wolverine attitude comes out when you shift close to the 7000 rpm redline. The engine snarls and you flat move out quickly! When I did a long trip on some 75 mph speed limit interstates, I got 39 mpg at 85-90 mph! (According to my new GPS the car is going an actual 75 when it indicates 80.) In town mpg varies in the high 20's depending on where I pick my shift points and throttle settings. 

The seats are very comfortable, and have plenty of adjustment for my over 6 foot friends. When it's all the way back the reclining is limited. For a car this size, the trunk is cavernous and it's quite roomy even with top in there. 

Regarding the removable top, it weighs 40 lbs. which is easy for me, tho' a bit bulky. Might be too much for a smaller person. I've only driven with it off twice in several years, as the ventilation with both side and rear windows open is great. About once a year, I take off the top and put a little silicone grease on the roof gaskets. If you don't do this a squeak develops. Driving with the rear window open is surprisingly quiet, even at freeway speeds. The air conditioning feels like you could freeze water inside the car when the air is set to recirculate. The combination of a large air conditioner radiator (looks bigger than the one for the engine) and small car volume make the air very powerful. The heater is equally efficient.

The car has a lot of similarities to the Mazda Miata. My mech. engineer/racer son says the Miata handles a little better but the Honda has a little more power. I've never driven it fast enough to slide it around a corner, and I don't baby it. In a wet slippery parking lot, it will plough when it breaks loose. The steering is very quick and feels precise. 

I'm not really an audiophile, but the radio and cassette sound very good to me. The inside of the car is low volume and you can really saturate yourself with sound.

The feeling of this car is lot like my 600 Ninja motorcycle, light, very peppy, and quite nimble. Like the cycle, the exercise of some self control is appropriate to those interested in long life and a point free driver record. This is a car where your survival philosophy should be avoiding the impact rather than 'tanking' through the crash. It's light and small and low. The latter can cause people to just look over you and not see that you're there. WATCH those big trucks! The car is so low and small that it vanishes in a parking lot, even behind a VW bug.

Overall I simply love driving this car, to the point that I'll drive from San Jose to Monterey for lunch, or make runs to the grocery store, just for the fun of driving it.

The only thing I hate is the radio antenna. It is easily broken off and then it has to replaced along with the all the connected wiring harness. That costs $100. I now am compulsive about putting the antenna down when I leave it parked.

If you get a chance to drive/buy one, jump on it!!
