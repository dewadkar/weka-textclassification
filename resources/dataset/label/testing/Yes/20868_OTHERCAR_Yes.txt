               O.K., I know you are 'spose to write an Epinion AFTER you have the product, but I cannot wait eight to ten months to let you know how excited we are about our cruiser!
 
   We ordered our cruiser today. At this time, in this state, there is a eight to ten month wait for your car to arrive. Is it worth the wait? You bet! Our dealer told us about a 65 year old woman from a small town here in IA, who came in to order her cruiser. She ordered the 5-speed manual transmission, and wanted to be SURE that hers came in with the &quot;Cue Ball&quot; knob! She has since that day, received her cruiser. She now says that she has had to park her car in the garage as she lives near a bike-path, and everyday her car is surrounded by gawkers. I love this car! I drive a 65 Ford Mustang, 2+2 fastback, for the same reason. I love it when the car I drive turns heads!!

   We ordered the Taupe Frost Metallic, and decided to get ours &quot;loaded&quot; with all the bells and whistles. We figure if we get this car and decide to sell it in even six months, we will come out very well financially. Don't get me wrong, we are gonna love this car....but it is nice to see a new car that holds it's value so well after pulling out of the car-lot!

   Here's a note to any of you considering this car. When you order this car, you put down a $500.00 deposit. The great part is that it is totally refundable if you change your mind. (not likely!!) Our dealer is not &quot;gouging&quot; in the price either. The car sells for the sticker price, no more. Now, he is also quick to tell you that they will not &quot;deal&quot; on this price as they do other new car stickers. He told us of a man coming in and offering him $38,000.00 for the model on their lot. They refused.

   The one draw back in ordering this car, would be that because of the shortage of models at dealers, you cannot see all the colors offered on the car. It is a bit hard to imagine your car and your color. There is usually a problem with other cars in that manner. We had to go and look at a LHS with the Taupe color, and then try to envision it on a Cruiser. I wish that was not the case. I like to see my car like it is gonna be when it arrives. I appreciate the Chrysler Web Site, and were able to see the color there, but the colors are not &quot;true&quot; on the monitor.

   This car has the best backseat of any car I have ever seen. Our son stands 6' 3 inches tall, and he had room to spare in the back! The Cruiser is about five or six inches shorter than a Neon, but it also stands about five or six inches taller than the Neon. So much head room in back!

   Cargo has so may options in this car. The table has three different levels to accommodate many different ways to transport cargo, and then the cute tail-gating feature. It makes a table with an electrical outlet near-by for your camping or tail-gating parties.

   We have a very large Bernese Mountain Dog. I love the feature that allows the back seats to come completely out of the car. This allows our dog to ride in comfort and style with his nose sticking out the back windows, which go down within two inches of being totally down. The seats remove very easily. Fold the seat, pull a lever, and pick up by the nifty handle at the top! One person can remove them easily.

   I wish I could tell you I have been driving this car for a month, and love it! I drove it for fifteen minutes and fell in love with it. I will just have to be patient and in eight or ten months, come back and tell you all about it!!
