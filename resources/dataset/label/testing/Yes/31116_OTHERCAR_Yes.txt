            My Jeep Cherokee Sport was the first car I ever got.  Actually, my parents bought it (after a Ford F-150 rear-ended our classic '79 Cutlass).  But when I went off to school, Mom and Dad hooked me up proper with my Sport.

Overall, it has been a quality vehicle.  I have only once had to take it in for a non-routine piece of work, and that concerned a computer chip that directed the fly wheel...so it was an important piece.  But, other than that, in the three years we've owned this vehicle, the maintanance has been routine -- oil changes, a new battery, tires, fluids, hoses etc.

As to the ride of the vehicle -- it's bumpy, I'll be frank, but I think it could be far, far worse.  

My Jeep happens to have oversized wheels, which I love, I'm so high up.

One downer is the gas mileage -- what with high prices for gasoline these days, the Cherokee is not the most fuel efficient vehicle on the market.  

Another perk of the vehicle is a wonderful V-6 4.0 liter engine.  My Cherokee goes when I need it to go. It has cajones, as some might say.

To sum up -- a Jeep is not the most practical family vehicle, especially a family with many children.  The back seats are not comfy for long riding.  However, it is nice for a college student (if you can afford it, since SUV insurance is automatically higher than a lot of other vehicles).  

I love it!<br><br>
