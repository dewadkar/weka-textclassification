            I  won't get technical here. This is simply a great vehicle that you'll feel good in! SUVs are very popular with car pool mommies in Atlanta, so I see a good many of them. The Toyota is not only the most attractive, it has been virtually maintenance free. Compare this with some American cars, and you'll be amazed that nothing ever goes wrong--even the little things. 

If you've never had an SUV or minivan, one of the great pleasures of these vehicles is the height. It is SO nice to be able to see over other cars--and safe. But don't worry, the 4Runner is not &quot;trucky&quot;; it feels like a car and is smaller than some SUVs. After test driving the Ford Explorer, Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee, I chose this car because (a) it was a Toyota (reliable, based on past experience), (b) it had great pick up (the Cherokee was doggie), (c) it was well designed inside and out, and (d) its rear window opens. At the time, anyway, this was the only SUV with this last feature. (I really wanted a convertible, but didn't want to be low to the ground, so now I open the sun roof plus all the windows including the rear one, and my daughter and I call it our &quot;almost convertible.&quot;)

Specific things I like about this car:

It is comfortable and, though the back seat is not overly generous, it is still roomy enough for two adults or three children.

The leather seats and attractive dash make it look classy.

There is plenty of cargo space for my needs--vacations and most Home Depot purchases--but not enough for serious hauling or large pieces of furniture. 

The radio is user-friendly for programming your favorite stations and has separate memory for two sets of FM stations and one set of AM stations. 

The clock is EASY to reset (one button changes the hour for Daylight Savings Time). 

Unlike some SUVs, this one is easy to get into (even with a straight skirt on) and the doors, including the rear hatch, close easily with a satisfying &quot;thump.&quot;

It is a quiet ride (if you have the rear window down, you have to get used to road noise behind you, which is a different sensation). This vehicle &quot;feels the road&quot; more than a car, but my husband says this type of suspension protects the car from my fondness for hitting potholes and curbs (I am a good driver, but they just appear out of nowhere!)

The heat and air conditioning work quickly and are easy to adjust JUST RIGHT. 

When the AC is on, you can push a button that gives the car extra power--good for pulling out into Atlanta traffic.

I've had the vehicle since 1996 when I leased it for two years and then purchased it, so I can't remember the exact cost. But since 4Runners retain their value more than most, I feel that it's been a very good purchase. I'd buy another today, except mine still looks and acts brand new!<br><br>
