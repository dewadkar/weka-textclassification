            As a long time owner of Dodge vehicles, it was difficult to buy a car that was not a Dodge.  We were in the market for a car that had a low maintenance level and high gas mileage.  After much research and several visits to car lots an too many phone calls, we made the decision to purchase a Saturn.  it was not like any other car buying experience we have ever had.  The sales people did not follow you around listening to your discussions, they were all nice and friendly and very helpful.  We felt no pressure from any of them.  We made the decision, filled out the paperwork and left to run some errands.  When we returned, all we had to do was sign the papers and leave.  
After we drove the car for a few days, we found that one of the doors was sticking when you tried to open it.  Since we live 80 miles from the dealership, I called, told them the problem and when I could bring it back to them.  When I arrived, they had everything filled out waiting for me and gave me another car to drive so I could leave the dealership.  At any other dealership, I would have been given one of the less expensive cars but they gave me one of their top of the line cars to drive.  It was a pleasant experience and i have really enjoyed the new car.<br><br>
