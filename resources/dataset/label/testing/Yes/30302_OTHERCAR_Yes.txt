            This vehicle is awesome.   Rides like a caddy, hauls like a work horse, looks like a concept vehicle - which it WAS about two years ago.

Here's something we did in our Avalanche that would have stressed ANY other truck/vehicle:

We are putting in new floors at the house, so had to go to Home Depot to buy some baseboard moulding strips.  Found out the size I need comes in 16'x3" strips.  Needed to carry those long boys home in the 'Lanche. 
 
Downed the midgate, left tailgate up.  Slid those strips all the way into the front of the cabin, between the two bucket seats, into the passenger floorboard.  Only a couple, maybe 3, feet were left sticking out of the back of the top of the tailgate.  Wife kept a hand on them to keep them steady, and off we went. 
 
NO problem.  
 
Just traded in a 1997 'Burban, and would have played HELL trying to fit those strips into that thing as easily and securely (without any tie downs) as the 'Lanche managed it. 
 
Definitely a Versatile Vehicle.  Passed test #1 with FLYING colors......... 

One problem is the height of the tailgate in back makes it hard to see small objects when backing up.  We will add a 'backup sensor' soon that will solve that problem.  I think Chevy should add that feature standard on all Avalanches in the future. 

So we are looking for great things out of it.  Gas mileage not so great yet, but will improve when I make a couple of minor mods - so far we have gotten about 15 mpg in mixed highway/city driving.

If you have a Suburban, and do not need to seat Seven, and are looking to upgrade - I can heartily recommend the 'Lanche.  Absolutely a future star for Chevy.
