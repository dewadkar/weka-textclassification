            This Truck has come in very handy. Last year my Fiance and I were looking for a second vehicle,we purchased a 1991 Sonoma from a private owner. I thought we were paying a little too much for it because the body had rust spots and it really needed a paint job. Looks are not everything, we have had nice looking cars but they always give us problems. This truck was worth every penny we paid for it! Although i had some trouble getting used to driving it.(very different from a car) I have grown to love it, it has a lot of power! I have since thought of trading the car in for another one, or maybe getting a GMC Jimmy. <br><br>
