            (See 07/06/2001 update below.)

I had several *thousand* reasons ($$$) to go with a Ford, but I chose the Toyota Tundra. Why? I will tell you here. I could have received several thousand dollars discount on a Ford truck -- Citibank Visa Ford dollars, relative who worked for Ford, extra dollars compensation for trading in my clunker 1994 Taurus -- but I chose the Toyota Tundra.

Two main reasons:

1) The Ford *dealers* -- as opposed to the Ford Motor Company -- were jerks. Not a single dealer in my area (Southern California) was willing to work with me or credit my legitimate Ford-endorsed discounts to the purchase of a new vehicle. They blew me off, stalled, lied. Makes them kind of useless. I was unhappy with my previous Ford purchase. But this is a Toyota review, so 'nuff said.

2) Toyota has a reputation for quality. I read many reviews of this truck before I bought it, and it would have been only so much hype if I didn't have many friends in the Southern California area who sweared by their Toyotas. My Ford Taurus didn't make it 100,000 miles. I know quite a few folks with 200,000 mile Toyotas.

So I bought a Tundra Limited 4x4 extended cab (Imperial Jade Green Mica), with cold weather package, leather interior, premium stereo, TRD off-road, etc. All of the factory options, plus an alarm (the only way to get remote keyless entry). I've put 2500 miles on it so far in the past 6 weeks. (It was one of the last of the 2000 model year.)

Now I grew up in Detroit, and like I said, I have a close relative who worked for Ford, so I can get a special discount. I tried to buy a Ford. I'm patriotic enough to buy an American car on principle (though the Tundra is built in Indiana). The Japanese autos have always seemed underpowered, and that was enough to keep me buying from the Big 3 in the past. It would have been much cheaper to do so. And I'm not trying to bash Ford, only trying to accentuate how much this truck impressed me. I am extremely happy with my purchase! Here is what I like and don't like.

Likes: From test-driving the Ford pickups, I expected the ride to be rough and uncontrolled. But the Tundra handles anything I give it with a smoothed responsiveness that outclasses my former sedan by a mile. This isn't a high-end sport sedan? It's also quieter. I purchased the 6CD premium stereo and enjoy it very much. I've taken it on dirt roads and tried out the 4WD and high-clearance capabilities. It never complains. 

I also drive the Los Angeles freeways on a regular basis, and it has plenty of power for passing, merging, and outdoing almost any normal car on the road. That's right -- it's got power. Enough power to impress me -- a guy who always eschewed Japanese cars for their underpowered engines. 

Many people develop an emotional relationship with their car. I don't. I want a machine that performs flawlessly, day in and day out. So far so good. Based on Toyota reputation I expect this to continue.

Dislikes: The prime complaint of American pickup owners is that the Tundra is 95% of a full-sized truck. And your point would be...? I am 6'6" tall, and there is no difference in leg room that I can detect. It fits me, and I am quite comfortable commuting 30-40 minutes a day. The American trucks are 3" wider, but that just goes into the center console, not the seats. So basically, the 95% argument is utterly pointless.

Additionally, the Fords (at least) do not have adjustable headrests. I would be at severe risk for whiplash in a Ford. The Tundra has adjustable headrests that will protect me in an accident. Maybe this belongs in the "Likes" section!

But now for the really bad. The worst I can say about this truck is that the drive shaft is improperly lubed from the factory. Upon stopping quickly, there is a big thunk as the bushings on the drive shaft account for the body pitch in a quick stop. This can be serviced at the dealer, under warranty. That's about it. Wow.

Overall, I am having a ball! I'll try to check back in for a long term view in the future. I still can't believe that Toyotas are *that* good long-term. But based on initial impressions I would have to admit they might be.

07/06/2001 Update

I now have about 15,000 miles on my truck. Took it on a 3000 mile road trip through barren parts of Nevada and Wyoming last month. Put the high clearance of the 4WD to good use, though I didn't really need the extra drive traction. Enjoyed every bit of the long drives, including driving through an 8 inch snowfall in Yellowstone National Park (in June!). Saw lots of Tundras on my trip -- it is no longer an unusual truck.

I have since added a SnugTop Expo camper shell. The truck still turns heads after a year of ownership.

One other problem has sprung up though: the disc brakes warp under heat from repeated braking at speeds greater than 40 mph, and I need to take it into the dealer for resurfacing. This is a known problem to Toyota, and is covered under warranty.

Still happy almost a year later!

04/17/02 Update

I now have 24,000 miles on the Tundra. Still going strong, and still getting compliments from complete strangers -- a lot of people like the Imperial Jade Green Mica paint color.
