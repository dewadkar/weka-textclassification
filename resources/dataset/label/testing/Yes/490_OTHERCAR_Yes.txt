                <b>S</b>ince late 2000, the Optima has been Kia's flagship of cars. While 'flagship' and 'Kia' put together may sound like an oxymoron to many consumers, the Optima, to those who have driven one have seen that Kia is not only about the cheap Sephia anymore. Kia presents an entire line-up of cars; economical, sport utility, and even entry level luxury.

   The 2002 Kia Optima is offered in 2 trim lines, the SE and LX. Both trim lines are available with either a 2.4 liter 4 cylinder, or a 2.7 liter V6. Both trim lines are also offered with a multitude of standard equipment, yet the SE catapults this car to near luxury car status. My test car was a SE V6 mated with a 4-speed automatic (a 5 speed is standard), with the sportmatic feature which is like most semi-automatics that allow cluthless shifting. The 2.7 liter V6 pumps out an adequate 178 horsepower at 6,000 RPM, and 181 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 RPM. While not really impressive horsepower, especially for a car that weighs nearly 3,400 lbs, the Optima does offer plenty of performance attributes.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> does come slow at first, but once the 2.7 liter engine reaches a substantial RPM the car moves just fine. Personally, I believe a larger engine would have been better suited for this vehicle, but as it stands the 2.7 liter V6 offers plenty of power for those who don't care about 0-60 times. 

The 2002 Kia Optima handles surprisingly well, and although this car is not made for superior <b>handling</b>, the Optima actually provided some fun on the twistys. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the Optima is quiet and quite refined for a car costing less than $25,000. The 2.7 liter offers smooth cruising, and the 4-speed automatic does a good job keeping the engine's RPM at a minimum while freeway driving.
Because the engine's power is reached at a relatively high RPM, and the car's weight is quite heavy, tackling hills is not really the Optima's strong assetts. On Loleta Hill, (10 miles south of Eureka CA) the Optima showed obvious strain as it down-shifted from 4th to 3rd gear. Don't get me wrong, the car can tackle hills all day long, but unlike the Chevy Impala, or Accord V6, this car takes a little more 'right foot power' to get the job done. 

<b>Braking</b> in my Optima was excellent, while 4 wheel disc brakes are standard with the SE trim, my tester also came with optional ABS which assured excellent braking, and confidence when coming to a sudden stop. 

While I did not get to personally test the <b>MPG</b> of this car, it is rated at 18/24 MPG. For a car with such a small V6 this is very poor fuel economy, and matches that of an automatic equipped Z28 which boasts over double the displacement of the Optima's engine, less technology, and is equally as heavy. With an EPA of only 24 MPG, this makes the Optima one of the most fuel consuming V6 powered cars on the road. With gas prices going up, one should really consider this.

   The Optima is FWD, and sits on a 106.3" wheelbase, with an overall length of 186.2". The Optima does boast a double wishbone front <b>suspension</b>, front and rear stabilizer bars, and an independent multi-link rear suspension. 


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the Optima is probably its strongest feature, offering loads of standard equipment and comfort that most people probably would not expect from Kia. The dash of the Optima is very modern, an easy to read instrument cluster is provided. The Optima offers excellent ergonomics, everything is in reach of the driver. The excellent drivers position makes for great all-around outward vision. Standard amenities with the SE trim are plentiful. Ac, tilt steering, CD and cassette player with six speaker sound, power moonroof, 8 way power drivers seat, cup holders, center console with excellent storage space, power everything, alarm, dual front and side air bags, and modest simulated wood are added and so much more! 
Options included leather seating for 5 adults, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. The seats are comfortable, and although the leather feels cheap it's not really a big issue in the comfort department. Room is excellent, tons of room up front, and adequate room in the rear. Trunk space is also adequate, easily enough room for 1 week worth of groceries for a family of 5.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> of the 2002 Kia Optima presents a very attractive 4 door sedan, while not giving a hint to how low the sticker price is. Looking similar from a side view as the Sonata. Unlike the <a href="/content_59795869316"> Hyundai Sonata</a> (the Optima's sister from Hyundai) the front fascia is bold and quite handsome. The Optima SE V6 has a chrome grille, fog lights, 15" alloy rims, flush mounted head lamps with 'see-through' effects, chrome door handles, and rectangular taillights. 

 <i>Price, Reliability, & Warranty:</i> 

The base model Optima LX, mated with a 4-cyl and 5-speed transmission starts out at around $15,000. My test car had a sticker of almost $23,000 which still made it less than the Accord V6 with the same equipment. Reliability has been excellent with the Kia Optima, many consumers who bought their Optima's in 2000-2001 are still very happy with this car today. If anything does happen to your new Kia Optima, Kia offers a 10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain warranty, a 5 year, 60,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, and a 5 year unlimited mileage roadside assistance plan.
