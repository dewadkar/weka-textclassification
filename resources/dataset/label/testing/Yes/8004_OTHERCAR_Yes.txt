            I have owned this car for a little over a month now and couldn't be happier (1700mi's).  Originally I thought that I would have liked the BMW 3-series or MB C-class better, but once I tried the X-type, I truly loved it.  The X-type styling is unique, not like the other German types.  And it has the nicest interior of the all the cars in this class.  The interior styling cues are close in line with it's big brothers the S type and the XJ.  Though modernized, the interior is covered in the perfect blend of Bird's eye Maple and English Connelly leather.  It hasn't fallen by the cheap, plasticy, aluminum wayside, like so many other vehicles-have you ever seen the inside of an Lexus IS300?  Sizewise, though dimensional the car is not much larger than the BMW or MB, it just feels larger to me.  It doesn't blare out entry level vehicle.  Every professional reviewer says the rear is a little cramped, but I disagree as I have ample legroom when sitting in the back (I'm 5'8").  Driving, the car is quite sporty and responsive, and the 2.5L auto tranny puts out a respectable 0-60 time in 8.5 secs.  Initially, I felt the auto tranny shifted a rough when you have to accelerate hard, but that has improved as the engine is starting to breaking in nicely.  I guess, if all out performance is your requirement, than the BMW may be better suited for you.   This car certainly isn't for everyone, but if you're in the market for a unique, modern, sporty, luxury sedan that's not a "me too" the X type could be for you too!  Can't wait to take advantage of the AWD and DSC this winter...
