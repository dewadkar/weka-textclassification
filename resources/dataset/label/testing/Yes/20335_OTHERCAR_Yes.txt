            ALtima's are one of the best cars to have.  It may not be top brand and most expenseive, but it fits your needs.  I needed a car which could fit my 3 children, and which would be comfortable.  Because I loved the nissan, I went from a centra to an altima.  Who knows... Maybe in a couple of years I'll get a Maxima.  The car is very good on gas, comfortable to ride in, holds five comfortably, and there are no recalls.  For an appropriate price, a nissan altima makes our family very happy.<br><br>
