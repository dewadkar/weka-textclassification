            I bought my Sante Fe in February.  I love the fact that I could afford an SUV for under $20K.  I was finally able to retrieve the lost space I longed for in a vehicle (I went from a mini-van to a Corolla to the Sante Fe).  Overall, it's a nice vehicle.   But - - - a few things drive me nuts on a daily basis.  Beware if the following would bother you:
1.  Don't buy the lowest powered engine available, in my opinion, it's just not adequate enough.  I fell for it to save a little money and regret it every time the car hesitates.  I now see no sense in having an SUV without 4-wheel drive.  The upswing, better gas mileage with the less powerful engine.
2.  Every time I get in the Sante Fe, the vent system defaults to bringing in air from the outside.  I prefer the other option and sometimes forget.  10 minutes after driving when I'm still roasting, I remember to push the button so that the AC air stays inside the car.  Just a peeve of mine because I have to change it EVERY TRIP.
3.  My stereo quality is pathetic - and I'm not generally concerned with this type of thing.  Loud just isn't loud and the sound is very "airy".  And my front passenger speaker died about a month ago.
Everyone comments that they love the look.  I'm generally comfortable while driving and it gets me where I need to go.  But it didn't satisfy me for long - I'm already thinking about my next car...
