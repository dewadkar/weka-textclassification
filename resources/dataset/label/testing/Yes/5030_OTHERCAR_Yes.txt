            I leased a 1999 Buick Regal LS for three years and just gave the car back three weeks ago (April 2002). My needs were for a mid-size, four-door sedan with a V6/V8 and over 200hp. I dismissed the Ford Taurus, as my sister has one provided by her company and she hates it. Under-powered and unreliable, and I am never able to get a comfortable driving position when I drive it. 

I went with a Regal LS, as the Buick Century was too under-powered and I did not like the column-mounted shifter. The Regal GS had the level of power that I wanted, but I disliked the torque-steer under heavy acceleration when I test-drove it. 

I took a dealer-display model for immediate delivery. This had a number of option packages installed � leather, alloy wheels, auto climate control, premium sound, trip computer and auto-dipping mirrors to name a few. I found the car to be very well equipped with a nice modern interior design. The seats were the best feature, being very comfortable (almost like a couch) and electrically adjustable to a good driving position. The steering-mounted radio controls are outstanding and, because I am constantly switching between radio stations and the CD, are actually safety features. Other items that I thought would be gimmicks but proved very useful were the Trip computer�s range function, the auto-dipping mirrors and the auto-headlights. 

The car itself was nice to drive in town or on the highways, being quiet and relaxed with good visibility. The engine had enough power, and traction control was fitted for slippery conditions. A heavy car, with front-wheel drive and traction control is good in most situations. It was excellent in snow or rain. I regularly visited a friend who has a trailer on a steep grassy hill in the New Jersey woods and the Buick got me in and out of there without a problem (even in the rain). Handling though proved less satisfactory. Cruising in a straight line is what the Regal was designed to do. Mine did not have the optional Touring-Suspension, but I suspect most Regal LS models do not either. When I drove on twisting back-roads, or even some curvy Parkways, my confidence reduced at speeds above 50 mph. 

Problems I had were mostly electrical and transmission related. The engine immobilizer disabled my starter on several occasions for no apparent reason. I usually had to wait for five to ten minutes for it to reset before I could start the car. The keyless entry system stopped functioning for a three week period twice during the car�s life with me. The dealer was never able to fix these two problems. After two years, the climate control started emitting an excruciating screeching noise whenever it was raining or humid outside. It sounded like a ventilation fan was in serious need of lubrication. This subsided after six months and only returned intermittently after that. Near the end, the transmission starting shifting gears with a very noticeable jerk after the car had warmed-up. The dealer traced and fixed this problem but it took a few visits. The car when new was very tight with no squeaks and rattles, but after a year it loosened-up and some appeared, though none were very annoying (except the squeaky fan!). I did 32,000 miles on one set of tires and averaged 22-23 mpg on my mixed town/highway commute.
