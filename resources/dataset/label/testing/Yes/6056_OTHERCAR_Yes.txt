            This is just the camera that I wanted because of its long zoom and manual settings.  Even though the manual is close to 300 pages long, I found the C740UZ to be very easy to learn and operate.  I was very skeptical of the electronic viewfinder, but I have found it to be acceptable, and I really appreciate all of the information that is displayed.  I wish that the information was shown in all of the camera modes.  I like to know what a camera is doing so that I can adjust it or just be prepared.  I have read many comments that this camera does not have image stabilization or a focusing aid.  I would like the focusing aid for low light situations, but I also want a relatively small camera.  If you want image stabilization learn to hold the camera by supporting it underneath the inner barrel of the lens, moving your elbows close to your body, holding your breath, and pressing the shutter without moving your hand.  If you need more, sit down and support your elbows on your knees.  If you need still more stability, hold the camera against something like a table or door frame.  If all else fails use a tripod.

I researched the other long zoom lens cameras before I bought the C740UZ. These included the Nikon 5700, Fuji 3800, Fuji S602, HP850, Sony 717, Minolta 7Hi, Panasonic, Olympus C720, Olympus C730, and Olympus C750.  Most were either too costly or did not have enough manual settings.  My favorites of these were the Nikon 5700 and Fuji S602 in spite of their size and, in the case of the Nikon, use of proprietary batteries.  I just did not want to spend $700 to $1000 for cameras that work almost as well as my $400 film SLR.  I thought about buying the C730 because of the additional features, but got the C740 because of the new lens.  I would prefer the C750 for the hot shoe and array size, but it was not readily available and cost $100 more than the C740.

Until I can buy a digital SLR for $500, the Olympus C740 is all that I need.  If you have used manual SLRs and want that  control without selling  your old cameras and if you want automatic setting that tell you what the camera is doing, this is an excellent choice.  If you have not used long focal length unstabilized lenses with a single frame camera, this is probably not the one to buy.
