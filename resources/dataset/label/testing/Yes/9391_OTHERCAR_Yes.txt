            I just purchased a 1999 Jetta 4 door.  The price was reasonable and the car is just fun to drive.  I love the way it handles in the corners, keeping tight to the road, with no overcorrection in turning.  The Jetta has good pickup, even when at speeds in excess of 65/70 mph.  When you step on the gas, it goes!  

The drawbacks I have found in the Jetta are small, but still worth considering.  The carpets are secured to the floor with plastic plugs.  These have been replaced on all four mats of the car in less than 6 months.  They come right out of the floor of the car.  

The gas mileage is not the best, but that may have to do with my driving style as much as with the car itself.  The headrests in the back seat are very distracting while driving.  Speaking of the back seat, if you are over 5 feet tall, you do not want to sit in the back!  There is NO room in the back for an average sized adult, especially if the front seat passengers are tall.  

This car is pretty much a drivers car.  The four doors are not really worth the effort.  If you want/need a four door, get a Passat.  If you want to drive fast, listen to the stereo loud, and have fun, the Jetta is for you.  <br><br>
