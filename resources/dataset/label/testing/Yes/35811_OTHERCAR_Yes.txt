            I'm a college kid and pizza delivery guy.  I bought a 1995 Saturn SL1 in the fall of 1998 because my last car died.  I paid about 7500 for it (a fair price but i might have been able to get it for less) and the car had 58K on it.

In the past 20 months I have put about 74K miles on the car (a 30 mile commute each way to school; plus about 75-150 miles a night at work) and all in all it has been great.  At 120K I replaced the clutch; at 100K i replaced the alternator and at 80K I replaced the EGR valve; total repair costs in 74K miles came to just over $1000

I'm happy with the car overall.  It gets good gas mileage (about 30 MPG in town) and it's got enough power to keep up with traffic.  The only thing I don't like about the car is the interior; it feels kinda cheap (always has) and it is falling apart.  The headliner is starting to sag and the front seats are crushed.

Beyond that, it's all good.<br><br>
