            When I purchased my '99 Amigo I wanted a vehicle that was sporty looking &amp;
a convertible. I did not realize how much fun it was also going to be. I
bought a 5 speed and the little truck has some get up and go. The sun roof
lifts all the way out and is easy to take out and put back in. The top goes down pretty easily. The only real problem I have is with the zippers on the top, they can be pretty aggravating and awkward to zip back up. It has a lot of nifty little storage compartments in it and tie downs for larger objects. All in all I am very pleased with my Amigo. <br><br>
