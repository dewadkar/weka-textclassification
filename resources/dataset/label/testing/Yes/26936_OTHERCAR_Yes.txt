            First off, this isn't my car but my Mom's. Even though I just bought a new 2001 Chevy S-10, I'm still a little envious. 

This car gets phenomenal gas mileage. It averages about 35 MPG, in the city! That beats my old Chevy Metro! But then again, a lot of things did. Even the riding lawn mower beat the Metro. The Camry she bought is a very nice car. It has power everything (I'm pretty sure it is the LE model, or better). My only complaint, and her's too, is the bottoming out problem. Supposedly this was fixed with the '99 and 2000 models, but I'm not sure. 

If you want to get a Toyota Camry for a family car, I'd suggest looking at cars that are 2 to 3 years old. Not because of the warranty or anything, but because of the reputation of the car. Toyota's retain their value very well, and you might just faint if you price a new 2001 model. They are now close to $20,000 or more fully equipped. 

The standard engine in the Camry is the 4CYL engine. Now, don't knock it  just because it is 4CYL. Toyota knows how to design strong, small and powerful engines. I've had the pleasure of driving her car once or twice, and I almost burned rubber. If you want more power, and don't mind the loss in fuel efficiency get the V6. 

Now this is what my Mom has told me. Of all the cars she has ridden in in the past 10 years ('90 Lumina, 92' F-150, '94 Taurus, '98 Camry, 2000 Metro, 2001 S-10) she told me that the Lumina and the Taurus were more comfortable for her based on her back and how the seats were designed. The Lumina was very comfortable, but couldn't stay more than a month out of the shop (NOTE: DO NOT BUY A LUMINA!!). She chose the Camry because it was her &quot;dream car,&quot; and I don't blame her. It is a very nice car, comfortable and dependable. 

It is the family car, so it is driven a lot. My Mom bought it used, and doesn't regret it. Doing so she bought a warranty that is better than with a new car. She loves it, and so do I. I liked the color of her Camry (Antique Sage) so much that when I picked my S-10 it was similar in color (Light Pewter Metallic) to her Camry. With my Dad's brown F-150 we have a color coordinated garage. <br><br>
