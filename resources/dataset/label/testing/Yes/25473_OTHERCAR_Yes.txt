            We bought our first Saturn in January of 1997 and we loved it. Then in September of 1997 we found out we were going to have another baby and our little SC2 would not have been big enough for a family of 4. We decided on another Saturn again because of the price, style and great things we heard about it. I really enjoyed my Saturn and had no problems with it. I liked the company but never gave too much thought on how great they were until I took it in for routine annual service.

 I had dreaded the appointment because my husband was to be at work which meant I would have to go drop the car off by myself with our 2 young children. This posed major problems because i had to figure out how i was going to get back home with the kids and their car seats not to mention being without a car all day. Well as soon as i pulled up they took my name down and asked if i needed a loaner car for the day. I said yes then turned around to start getting the kids out and before I knew it, the loaner car was parked right behind my car. A man who worked there came over and actually helped me switch the kids and the car seats into the other car. After going over some paperwork and signing some agreements, I was on my way!

 A few hours later the dealership called my house and told me my car was ready. When i picked up the car, it was different people working but the same treatment. As I paid for the service they parked my beautiful shiny car right out front and replaced the car seats. Altogether I spent a total of five minutes at the dealership. 

This experience opened my eyes on how great Saturn really is on service. They turned what I thought was going to be a terrible experience into an easygoing one! I highly recommend this auto for people with children and even people without!<br><br>
