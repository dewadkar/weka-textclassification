            I started looking for a car when I agreed to take a job that
required commuting. The most important thing I was looking
for was reliability, followed by practicality. After doing
weeks of research, I settled on the Honda Civic. I wanted
ABS, which meant the EX with automatic transmission. For 
me, this is THE ideal car.

It is:

-well equipped (power windows &amp; locks, moonroof, A/C, CD player)
-inexpensive
-safe (ABS is a MUST when you share lousy Mass roads with 
 lousy Mass drivers)
-reliable
-economical to operate (28 mpg city, 35 highway)
-very fun to drive

You often hear the Civic is more expensive than other cars in 
its class, but when you compare the EX against similarly equipped
competition (look at the cost of options on a Saturn, for example)
the Honda looks really good.

You also hear that the Civic looks bland, there are millions of 
them on the road and you'll look like everyone else. I say, if the 
Civic coupe looks so bland, why did BMW make their latest 
3-Series coupe look *so* much like the Civic? Besides, the 
Civic is made to be customized.

On the road, my car is very much a pleasure to drive. It 
handles very nicely indeed, for something that isn't a sports 
car. Acceleration/passing power on the highway is good, but be 
warned you have to rev the engine high to get it.

The interior is roomier than you'd think. Legroom both front and 
back is very good, and headroom is OK- I'm 5'11&quot; and comfortable 
up front, and I've had 2 5'10&quot; people in the back at the same 
time with no problems. The trunk is pretty roomy, and the rear 
seats fold (split 60/40) to give extra cargo room.

The few things I think don't quite measure up are the radio/CD 
player (it's mediocre and weak), the tires (not very grippy, and 
*really* loud on wet pavement) and the interior (a little too 
much cheap gray vinyl-looking substance). Still, that's a short 
list of complaints for an economy car, and the first 2 out of 3 
problems are easily remedied.

I would recommend this car to *anyone* who wants dependable
transportation at a reasonable price, that's comfortable and
fun to drive. It's a GREAT value.

Someone looking for a real sports car, or a status-symbol on
wheels should probably look elsewhere.<br><br>
