                 Honda's racy 2000 Civic Si coupe is an import performance enthusiast's dream.  It has instantly attained a cult status among young and old enthusiasts alike, and for a price of around $17,000, is too irresistible to pass up.
     The Civic Si is at the top of the food chain when it comes to Civics.  Standard are power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, CD player with six speakers, and even a power moon roof.  The instant you sit down in a Si you'll appreciate the firm seats and easy to read gauges.  Enticing to the touch is the silky smooth 5-speed shifter (only transmission option on the Si) and leather wrapped steering wheel.  Further inspection reveals a 9,000rpm tachometer with an 8,000rpm redline.  Which brings us to the engine.  Honda's little jewel of an engine, the B16a, is a 1.6 liter DOHC VTEC rev monster.  Courtesy of Honda's Electronic Valve Control with Variable Timing, the little 1.6liter is capable of churning out 160hp at 7600rpm.  
     While driving under the VTEC switchover point of 5500rpm, the Si is docile and fuel efficient, making it perfect for scuttling around town.  The fun begins after 5500rpm when the engine switches to the bigger cam lobes, and the fun doesn't stop till a sonorous 8,000rpm.  The only downside to all this top end power is a lack of torque at lower engine speeds. The Si only makes 111 ft-lbs of torque at a lofty 7000rpm.  The Si also excels when it comes to connecting some apexes.  With an independent double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, the Si is capable of mustering some serious grip.  It is also the only Civic to incorporate both a front and rear anti-roll bar.  The standard 6 x 15 aluminum wheels are attractive, and are shod with 195/55-R15 Michelin XGT V4 tires.  The ride is somewhat harsh, but much more comfortable than many of the other sports cars out there.
     The Si is not for everyone.  Someone looking for Camry-like ride quality and sound proofing need apply elsewhere.  Though, if you're wanting that race-like feel and sound, only the Si can deliver it in such an attractive and affordable package.  Then again, if you're considering an Si, you probably don't care about trunk space or cabin noise.  Happy revving!
