            We bought this chevy s-10 new in 1992, and have been totally pleased with it.  It currently has 159,000 miles on it and there have been no major problems.  It still has the original clutch, battery, timing belt, water pump.  The only thing we have ever done to it is to replace the tires, serpintine belt and the u-joints.
We have the extended bed with the regular cab.  We had a cap on it for a long time, then replaced it with the tool box.
This has a 2.8 liter, V-6, and although many say it is not a good motor, we have had nothing but great luck with it.
We change the oil at every 3000 miles, and the gas mileage is fine, about 20 MPH highway, and all miles are highway miles as this is used for an hour commute daily.
We have had to replace the headlights at least 6 times, as they burn out quickly.
The interior locks and glove compartment latch is not very sturdy.  But the seats and floors have held up well.
We plan to buy another S-10 this year.<br><br>
