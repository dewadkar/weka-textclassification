            We bought our Isuzu Stylus in January 1991.  I was pregnant and due in 2 weeks and all of our vehicles had cratered on us and I needed reliable transportation to the hospital.  The Stylus proved to be just the ticket and so much more.  It took me to the hospital and home again and has just kept on going and going.
My husband travels extensively with his job and now 9 years later with almost 250,000 miles on it, the little car is doing just fine.  We have done the usual maintenance on it, oil change, timing belt, tune up and a clutch replacement but that is it.
The car originally had no air conditioning, which in Texas is a BIG no no!!  We had the air conditioning put in, for less than $1,000 and it too has worked great. 
The shifting is smooth, great for someone like me who can &quot;bunny hop&quot; down the road getting out of first gear.  The seats are exceptionally comfortable and adjustable.  
All in all this is the best car I've ever owned.  I just wish Isuzu would start importing automobiles into the United States again.  They still import trucks &amp; SUV but no automobiles.  Hopefully they will change their mind about that.  I'd love to have another one.
