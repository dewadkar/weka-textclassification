            I purchased this vehicle back in April 2000 for a couple of reasons.
From affordability right up to cosmetics, the Dodge Dakota turned out to be an excellent buy for me.
  There are a couple of things that I like and only one thing that I really would prefer to change on the truck. The Dodge Dakota has enough room to seat six guys out on a beer run, or comfortably handle two for a night out on the town.
  For a mid-size truck, the Dodge Dakota is the best handling vehicle that I have driven for its class. It rides like its larger brother (RAM)and provides an excellent field of view for the driver and passengers.
Not to mention Dodge has installed an auto dimming rearview for the driver
  The Dodge Dakota is available in both 4x2 and 4x4 versions, however if your seriously considering purchasing this truck I can't imagine why you wouldn't get it in the 4x4 type. The Dakota is a rugged &amp; tuff mid size truck that is not to hard to drive around town or country.
  The truck I purchased came with a V6 Magnum engine, and quite frankly that is my only real sore spot involving this auto. The V6 Magnum is a good size engine for those of you who worry about gas consumption, and reasonable pulling power.
  However, I have pretty much always driven vehicles that have a V8 and am not use to transitioning down to the V6. I wish it had a little more &quot; spunk &quot; from the stoplights, but other than that I have no major complaints about the engine itself.
  The Dodge Dakota is a mid-size truck for just about everybody, from the businessman getting around town to the housewife getting the kids out &amp; around. The Dodge Dakota is by all means a multi purpose vehicle!<br><br>
