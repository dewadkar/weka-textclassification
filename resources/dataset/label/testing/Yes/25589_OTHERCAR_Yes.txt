            I had always promised myself that, if I was single on my 30th Birthday, I would buy myself a Porsche 911.  Not a new fancy Porsche mind you, but a very used one, mid-80's at the newest.  I only needed a weekend car, so who cares about practicality.  

A few months before my birthday, reality struck.  A new job required me to join the Silicon Valley Lemmings on US 101 every day for a twenty-five mile commute from San Francisco.  My new company offered to lease a car for me, but not surprisingly, a used Porsche was not going to happen.  

And so, I went into the market looking for a car to lease with the right balance of &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;sensible,&quot; driving Audis, BMW, VW, and even a Mercedes C280. (For the record, the Mercedes was awesome).  It wasn't until I had almost settled on a Audi A4, that I came across a Saab promotional campaign promising a practically fully subvented lease.   The difference in price between the two cars under lease was stunning:  $340 per month for a Saab 9-3SE (the sport package with upgraded interior) versus $550 per month for the Audi A4 (the money was at, YIKES, 8.5%). 

Done deal on Price.  

Any idiot can look up the hard data and specifications on the Saab and compare it to the competition.  Instead, let me concentrate on the intangibles.  

The Saab is a sporty, solid, well engineered, feel the road, hug the curves, definitely not American car that does not scream, &quot;I AM RICHER THAN YOU AND I AM ONLY THIRTY.&quot;  In other words, Saabs don't make you look like a jerk, they're too clunky-looking for that.   The sad truth is that some young people who buy brand new BMWs are jerks.  They've ruined it for the rest of us.  Maybe this is a California thing.  

As for power and speed, the Saab may not keep up with a M3, but who cares.  I have the 200-HP turbo.  It goes plenty fast for me.  In fact, anyone that needs to drive faster is breaking numerous laws.  If you feel absolutely compelled to drive faster than you can in a Saab, you are a jerk, so buy a BMW.  

The Saab is quite comfortable but the 9-3 is just barely legit in terms of back seat.  I have put five people in the car, though one was a twelve year old girl.   

And did I tell you about the trunk?  The trunk, in a word, to DIE FOR!  Its huge, probably holds more than most Japanese SUVs.  

The instrument panel is designed quite well.  There are two major strengths.  The radio controls on the wheel are incredibly easy to use and enable you to control music without looking.  The display is generally clean and has an option that allows you to go into night mode so that only the speedometer shows.  On long trips, reducing the glare is welcome.  

Decent sound system, not incredible.  

Some negatives.  

The Saab is nowhere near as smooth to drive as some other cars.  You have to rev the engine to make it smooth.  The clutch is clunky when compared to the Audi.   You do get used to it, however.  Just remember: your Saab needs lots of love with your right foot.  

You cannot remove CDs when there is coffee in the cupholder. This unfortunate engineering snafu will result in screams, either from frustration or spilt coffee.  

Finally, there is a little icon on the dash board that tells you when you are supposed to shift gears.  This function is perhaps the most annoying thing I have seen in a car of such quality.  I bought a $30,000 car and I don't know when to shift?  The light flicks on regularly for me (because if you shifted according to the light you would do 0-60 in ten MINUTES flat) drawing my eyes toward it and away from the road.  [Note to Saab representative reading this review:  please issue a recall to remove this feature].  If I want to drive to maximize fuel efficiency (the point of the light), I will.  

Other than that, its a great car.  Thank you Saab for saving me from a lifetime of German engineering. <br><br>
