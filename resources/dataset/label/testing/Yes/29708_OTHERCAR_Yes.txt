            The 97 Subaru Legacy is a car for a person who needs to be able to get somewhere at any time. Rain, Snow, Slush, you name it it takes it. This car gets about 26 miles a gallon in the city, and almost 32 on the highway. The drive is somewhat sporty, though the 4 cylinder engine could be a bit stronger going uphill. I wouldn't call it a super quiet ride, but for the money, it's certainly holds it's own. the steering wheel is hard to turn, but it responds very well to once you get used to it. The brakes are superb. The sound system is awful but then again I'm comparing it to my J30's Bose + Alpine system. ( See my review of the J30 ). The trunk is very good thanks to the fold down seat. I love the ride in bad weather, and you can't tell you're on ice because it's so smooth. If you're looking for an inexpensive car for a family, this car is the way to go.<br><br>
