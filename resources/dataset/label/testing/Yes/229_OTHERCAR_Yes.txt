            After reviewing many camera's...and buying several...I still had to buy this one for it's quality and functionality.  The Canon Powershot has options and functions enough to satisfy every photographer, amateur or professional.

*** GENERAL ***
DIG the VERY BIG and FUN PICTURES taken by the POWERSHOT!  They can max out at 2048x1536, or 3.1 MEGA, which is MUCH BIGGER than most people have their computer screens set at, meaning you can make SUPER PRINTS as well as ENJOY the FUN DETAILS in the pictures you take.  Powershot G1 is equipped with a GENERAL VIEWFINDER and a TiNY SCReeN for taking REAL GOOD PICTURES!  But the ADD-ON lenses somewhat cover the GENERAL VIEWFINDER..but hey, the TiNY SCReeN is much more FUN anyway!  Camera has a SUPERFUN gray kinda blue color.  Takes AWESOME hi-quality hi-color images with good contrast to the surroundings when the lighting is good.  With a little experimentation if you make the lighting JUST RIGHT you can make INCREDIBLY PERFECT and PROFESSIONAL looking pictures...but like all cameras snapping indoor with low light and no flash, you will get grainy un-fun pictures.
Has INCREDIBLE battery life...and it is GREAT to NOT HAVE TO constantly PLUG-IN, RECHARGE, or EXCHANGE batteries to enjoy your SUPERFUN CAMERA!

*** FUNCTIONS ***
Powershot has general automatic shooting settings for a basic camera user who STILL WANTS to get GREAT QUALITY IMAGES, and you WILL.  But it has many small adjustments that can be made to make your picture taking experience much more FUN!  Powershot has 
a. RED-EYE REDUCTION mode where it flashes a couple of times until your pupils close preventing SATAN EYES.
b. MOVIE MODE of 320x200 pixel resolution which records a small AVI file movie for 30 seconds with audio at 15 frames Per second.  Half the frames of standard DVD or motion picture speed.
c. FAST BUTTON One of the BEST functions of this camera is how FAST it TAKES PICTURES.  Most of the digital cams have a delay in-between each picture which is so long that the camera's do not function well for quick-clicking photo sessions like that of photographing a Supermodel while she moves and touches her hair in 100 different positions.  Well this camera is fast enuf to get SUPER SHOTS of a SUPERMODEL!

*** EXPANDABILITY ***
The POWERSHOT has 3 additional lenses which are sold seperately but can be a GREAT ASSET to you PICTURE TAKING EXPERIENCE by EXPANDING on YOUR CREATIVITY and making your array of pictures more FUN and INTERESTING for your FRIENDS and FAMILY to enjoy with YOU!  The special lenses are for WIDE ANGLE, TELECONVERSION, and EXTREME CLOSE-UP!
