            We bought our van used in '01 with under 100K miles.  Clean and maintained by the previous owner made the van a good buy.

The transmission has started to "act out" and shift roughly from a stop and when cold.  Also makes a "chunking" noise when wheel is turned almost all-the-way right when reversing.  Black metal trim paint around windshield is peeling off exposing the metal, but that is easily remedied with sealant.  Doors do not have much protection against dings - we either live in a really inconsiderate area with lots of door bangers or they are just easily dented.

Seats are comfortable and easy to move or remove.  Love the fact that they fold down for tables if needed on a long road trip.  Do not like that middle seat has no cup holders and that the kids and supercede your radio choice from a little convenience panel in the same seating area.

Great gas mileage and pretty low-maintenance for an eight year old car, except for the potential problems listed above.  Be sure you buy one that has been well maintained by a reputable mechanic and trustworthy seller.
