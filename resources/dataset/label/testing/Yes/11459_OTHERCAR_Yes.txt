            Okay. I admit it. When I first when shopping for my "new" car, (my 1988 Mercury Tracer, had finally died its last death), I wanted something with a little sex appeal. I was lusting after a Toyota Celica that was about $3,000 out of my price range, when my dad told me about a Saturn he'd seen. Now, no offense to Saturn, but their older models to me, can be just downright ugly. Especially when shopping for sex appeal :) 

I bought my white 1995 Saturn SL-2, with 73,000 miles on it, on December 4,2000, for the bargain price of $7400 total. A month later, I can tell you why I'm not nearly as in love with it now as I was then. Don't get me wrong, it's a great car, and with a little fine tuning in some areas, it could be an even greater car. Saturn designers, take out your pad and pencil.

<b>Cup Holders - </b> Now, if you're like me, I got the optional center console to conceal all the random junk I end up carting around with me. I'm hypoglycemic, so I carry food a lot. My ashtray holds Jolly Ranchers, and my center console, usually is hiding a small bag of Baked Lays. I'm just like that. Anyhow, back to the point :) The center console option robs you of a cup holder, which is situated between the two seats, for use by a rear passenger. This leaves you with 2/3 right? Wrong. Want an ashtray? Now you've got one left. <b>One cup holder?</b> Saturn, are you nuts?

<b>Center Console - </b> Honestly, I'm sorry I got this added. I like the fact that I can store my stuff in it, and that it's got little areas where my tapes fit, but honestly, it doesn't fit much else. I've found that if I dig out the big area, and oversized drink will hold quite nicely there, but other than that, this doesn't rank up there as my favorite add-on.

<b>Window Seals - </b> I'm not entirely sure of the correct name for this, but it's the part that seals the rain, water, etc from the inside of your car. Well, at least, on most cars it does. Mine's "special". It'll randomly drop about 5-10 drips of water on my shoulder, but that's random too. Some days it will, some days it won't. When I scrape together the cash to fix it, I'll let you know if it's an expensive repair. 

<b>Window Controls - </b> Now honestly, this doesn't bother me, but I'll relay my passenger complaints to you :) The window controls on a Saturn, are in the center, the console area. Now, this irritates the heck out of my passengers, but it's actually a pretty cool convenience for the driver, once you get used to it. But passengers, do tend to complain about it. The parking brake sits a little high, so they have to reach over it to roll down a window, not really convenient.  

All in all? that's not bad. I've got ample trunk room, and quite a bit of 'get up and go' when my car's in "performance" mode. (I think it's a fancy term for overdrive off :P) My windshield wipers are great, my stereo, while on the weak side, would be fine for anyone not wanting to blast it 24/7 :) 

I especially like the actual dashboard itself, I like my little bubble where my tac and my speedometer are, that's so race-carish :) It's adorable. I enjoy the bright lights and the ability to switch the light settings on it, about 4 different ones, from low to high. Air conditioning works like a charm, with no effect on the car's RPM or power, and the car is *very* fast to heat up, and the heater's more than ample on those cold mornings.

My rear defrost works wonderfully too, and the 1995 model has it set to run for 15 minutes, then auto-shut off. One drawback? You can't turn it off before 15 minutes, unless you turn your car off, but that's not a big deal, at least to me. My cruise control works like a charm as well. I've tried it out many a time, and it's never failed me. It's easy to use, clearly marked, and a great gas-saver.

It gets wonderful gas mileage. I have a 12 gallon tank, and I get about 330 to a tank, though I can honestly say, that I usually have about 1.5 gallons left when I fill up. I'm too paranoid to go lower :) One thing that I don't like about my Saturn in the way of fuel, is that there's no fuel light. And I almost found that one out the hard way :) I was determined to see how many miles it got before the fuel light came on. One problem? I don't HAVE a fuel light! :) A fuel perk for those out there looking to save a little cash, the car only takes low-grade fuel (ex. 87) therefor saving you a little money at the pump.

Space? I'm 5'9" and I'm fine in the front seat, I've noticed that my guy friends with long legs seem to look a little scrunched but they never say anything. But still, I think if my airbags ever deployed, it'd break their kneecaps. The back seat's got ample space. My father is 6'5" and about 240 and he sits comfortably in the back. Trunk space is ample, though the lining is a bit on the cheap side (for $7k, I'm not expecting it to be lined in solid gold). 

It's got a lot of little things, but it's a good car. I'm hard on cars, I like to drive fast, get power when I demand power, and be comfortable. My car is totally reliable. I've had it a month, and it rides like a charm. I haven't had even the littlest of problems with it mechanically, and I'm picky. The window seal thing, is my greatest gripe :) It's got some great bang for it's buck. And trust me, I'll edit this if my opinion starts to change as the ownership wears on :) Let me know if I forgot anything! I'll be happy to edit :) 

My car: White 1995 Saturn SL-2. Power Windows, Power Door Locks, Tilt, Cruise, AM/FM Cass, 76000 miles at time of epinion. 

<b>UPDATE!</b> Well. I got my car fixed. Sort of. I took my car into Saturn on 2/16, and got it back 4 hours late, the same night. For the bargain price of $144, I got my front two door seals "fixed", my driver side window to rattle, and my dashboard to make a funny buzzing sound. Not to mention, my car still leaks. Now Saturn wants $132 to seal my WINDOWS. All in all, I'm wishing I'd got a Honda. However, since it still runs, and there's no massive mechanical errors, I guess I can't complain...too loudly.
