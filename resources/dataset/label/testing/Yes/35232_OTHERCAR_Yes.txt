            <b>----- General Trooper Information -----</b>

The Isuzu Trooper has been produced for over twenty years worldwide, and is respected in many countries for it&#146s off-road prowess and reliability.  Sadly, it hasn&#146t received such a warm welcome in the United States, and was canceled in 2002.  There&#146s only one thing I blame for the downfall of the Trooper, and that would be the Consumer Reports hack-n-slash job on the 1996 Trooper.  Their story was the ultimate Naderism, and caused such a furor that sales on the Trooper fell abysmally.  After various strategies and incentives failed, Isuzu canceled the Trooper in 2002 due to lack of sales volume.

The 1994 Trooper I own is considered a 3rd generation model, and it was produced from 1992 until 1997.  There were several option packages available, from the basic Trooper S up to the fully loaded LE.  Just as the <a href="/content_82526768772"><b>Rodeo</b></a> was cross-branded as the Honda Passport, so the Trooper was marketed as a Acura SLX.  You&#146ll find the same powertrain and most interior pieces are the same between both models.  Since the resale value on both models is about the same, you may want to look for an Acura since they did have more gadgets and marginally upscale interiors.  The Trooper is much easier to locate since they sold at a much faster rate than the SLX.

<b>----- My Trooper Experience -----</b>

My Trooper is a 1994 Trooper S V6 with the 5 speed manual transmission.  It has only the standard options, which makes it quite loaded by 1994s standards.  It had 89K miles when I purchased it, and was it very good condition.  I have since added an alarm system, remote keyless entry, custom wheels and tires, and an upgraded stereo system.

<b>Overall Appearance</b>

I really like the way the 3rd generation Trooper looks from every angle, especially my all white version.  The LS models had two tone paint jobs, with the bumpers and lower cladding a different color.  The overall look is tall and muscular, with the obvious priority being interior space.  From the back the Trooper looks quite large, as the rear door area is quite square.  The side view puts this SUV in better proportion, as you can see the large hood offsets the bulky body.  The only ugly parts on a stock Trooper are those hideous wheels.  I really wonder what some manufacturers are thinking when they specify wheels for a new model.  &#147Well guys, we know people will never agree on what looks great on our new SUV, so why don&#146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalog!  Then they&#146ll HAVE to buy new rims.&#148  Isuzu should take notice of the wheels Jeep puts on their Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models, subtle yet stylish.  The wheels on the Trooper are dished inwards, and look like an oversized pie pan only inverted.  I chose to add <i>M.B. Motoring </i>Shock wheels in a 7.5&#148 x 16&#148 size.  These put my tires about 1.5&#148 wider on each side, and let me fit 245/75/16 Nitto Terra Grappler tires without a lift and still have no rubbing.  The rims and tires are obviously not necessary, and were purely personal preference.  I will say my Trooper looks much nicer with its new wheels.

<b>Interior Appearance & Comfort</b>

The inside of the Trooper takes a little while to get used to.  For one thing, a 6&#146 tall man will have 6-7&#148 of room above his head when he sits down.  This SUV does have loads of head room, and a very generous amount of leg and knee room as well.  This goes for the back seat too, and the rear seat is also wide enough to seat two adults for any length of time in comfort.  For some reason the front seats are slightly firmer, and give you better support over long distances.  On a 1300-mile trip this fall, the back seat passengers were always asking to stop before the front seats. As I said before, it&#146s not the room that is the problem, but more the composition of the seat material.

The dash controls are laid out in an fairly accessible manner, and most functions are easily reachable without focusing on them too much.  The learning curve for the controls can be steep for those of us used to American vehicles. The main problem you might run into will involve the wiper and headlight controls.  For some reason, Isuzu decided to put them both on the dash instead of the steering column where God intended them to be.  After almost 10,000 miles of being the sole driver of my Trooper, I still turn off my headlights when I mean to turn off the wipers.  It doesn&#146t help that they are both exactly the same size and shape.  A lesser annoyance is the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wiper switch.  They are placed on either side of the steering column on the dash, and right behind the steering wheel spokes.  You have to feel around for them at night until you are familiar with their location.

Now for the good points, the 5-speed shifter feels very smooth for a truck transmission.  One thing that seems so unimportant but which I&#146ve really come to enjoy are the pull-handles on all five doors.  Just slide your hand into the handle and pull out, no thumb jamming or button pushing required.  I also appreciate the lighted window switchgear; it&#146s a nice touch for those dark nighttime drives.  Standard power mirrors are a nice feature on any base model SUV, but Isuzu went the extra mile with heated and folding mirrors.  The heaters are selectable with a handy on/off switch, and those narrow garage doors are easier to navigate when you push the mirror button and watch the mirrors fold into the door.  Power locks allow you lock or unlock all five doors from the driver&#146s door, and simplify the entry of multiple passengers.  Fit and finish on the interior materials is mid-level at best, but still acceptable for a mid-90s SUV.  The cloth is a very stain resistant material, and much nicer in cold weather than leather.  The interior of most Troopers will be the dark gray theme of my truck, and it&#146s great for those too lazy to clean.  Tan and black both show the dirt much worse than gray, so three cheers for monochromatic color schemes!  I really prefer the lower end interior trim instead of the fake wood and rabbit-fur trim on the &#147high-end&#148 LS.  I&#146m driving an import SUV thank you, not my grandparents Olds 88 Regency Brougham.  Since I don&#146t have kids of my own, I can&#146t comment on child seat installation, but the rear doors do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the opening to position your kidlets in their seats.  The 3 rd gen Trooper is too old to be equipped with the LATCH child seat system, so you&#146re stuck with the old seatbelt rigmarole.

The rear seatbacks are adjustable, which is a rare feature in this class of SUVs.  They recline far enough to get comfortable and rest.  To fold the seats down, you only need pull the recline button and move the seatback forward.  This will bring the seatbacks to a level position, but they most definitely don&#146t fold into the floor.  You&#146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolts and remove both rear seats for maximum cargo capacity.  This isn&#146t a job you want to assign to your wife, since both rear seats are heavy and bulky.  Normally this isn&#146t a problem, since there is a large amount of storage behind the upright seats.  The rear doors are of the 2/3 1/3 variety, with the larger left door opening first.  This is preferable to the &#147dutch&#148 doors on Suburbans and Astro vans.  Usually I only need to open the left door, so access is easy with the large opening.  There is a latch on the bottom that locks when the door is fully open, which is useful on a hill or when it&#146s windy outside.

<b>----- Performance & Handling -----</b>

The stock 3.2 liter V6 is adequate for everyday duties, and is surprisingly gutsy up to 35 mph.  The 188 ftlbs of torque are to thank for the Trooper&#146s low-end grunt, but 175 hp isn&#146t quite enough for this 4,300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freeway.  The onramp acceleration speeds are acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  Above 75 mph the Trooper&#146s design elements begin to work against it.  Its boxy shape gives it a lot of cargo room for its size, but also endows it with the aerodynamics of a barn.  Side winds buffet the Trooper slightly more than other SUVs, although it feels unsettling more than dangerous.  After driving my Trooper at least 5,000 interstate miles I&#146ve found it rides better with a medium load, which is evidence of the truck-based body on frame design.  I can say the Trooper rides much nicer than Isuzu&#146s <a href="/content_82526768772"><b>Rodeo</b></a>, mostly due to the coil sprung rear axle.  Coil springs generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a better, more compliant ride.  This is definitely the case with the Trooper, and this helps to keep the hideous potholes at bay on the frozen roads of the Midwest.  Brakes have an excellent feel, and stop predictably when needed.  Braking distances seem to be average for an SUV, although 4 wheel anti-lock was only an option in 1994.  

Handling is better than you would expect for a vehicle of the Trooper&#146s size and height.  While it does have a large degree of body roll, it will stick to a corner at much higher speeds than most will want to attempt.  Slalom type maneuvers are accomplished with moderate body sway, and a little drivetrain shudder.  The emergency lane change was where Consumer Reports nailed the Trooper for rolling over, and this was later proven to have been a biased report.  Other auto magazines attempted to recreate this situation, and failed to achieve a rollover.  While this is essentially a truck, and it has limitations like all SUVs, I don&#146t consider the Trooper any more prone to rolling than any other SUV of the mid 90s.  One more thing, the 1998-2002 models were heavier and consequently had a higher center of gravity, so the earlier models aren&#146t as top heavy as the newest generation.  I would choose the 5-speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle, since the auto robs more power from the merely adequate engine.  It also does not shift quickly or firmly, and feels very sluggish in city traffic.

<b>----- What About The Competition? -----</b>

The Trooper&#146s main competitors are the Toyota 4Runner, Jeep Cherokee, Ford Explorer, and Chevrolet Blazer.  

The 4Runner is admittedly a better vehicle, both in fit & finish and in quality.  The 3.0L six cylinder engine is comparable in both power and real-world performance.  It&#146s definitely smaller inside, so both passenger and cargo space suffer.  It also costs up to twice as much used as a Trooper.  You get what you pay for, so for those on a budget the Trooper is going to look better.

Jeep has been working on its Cherokee model for almost 20 years, so even in the mid-90s it was a well sorted out vehicle.  I&#146ve had the pleasure of riding in several Cherokees, and these are my conclusions.  The Cherokee is by nature a better off-road vehicle, and can tackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form.  It has a better auto transmission, and when equipped with the 4.0L inline six will perform very well both on the highway and in the city.  Where it falls behind everyone else in this class is interior refinement.  A 1994 Cherokee still feels very much like a truck inside, and rides like one too.  For a family that needs 4WD and a strong frame-based vehicle, the Cherokee deserves a close look.  Anyone that will see most of their miles on the highway should head towards a 4Runner or Trooper, which are both better asphalt SUVs.

I haven&#146t owned a mid-90s Ford Explorer, so I can&#146t give you factual data for a comparison.  I do know some casual friends that have owned them, and reactions are mixed.  While cheap to repair like most American made vehicles, 90s Explorers will be having more than their share of breakdowns by this time, and this is proven by their poor reliability scores.  They also have a propensity to rust under the doors and around the rear wheels.  I would personally recommend the Explorer to someone.

The GM Blazer/Jimmy twins were always popular in the northern states due to their relative low cost, and the fact they were available in 4WD and several body configurations.  While they do carry a reliability history somewhat better than the Explorer, it&#146s still a notch below Jeep and the imports.  Many of the interior features feel &#147cheap&#148, even on upper end SLT models.  For some reason GM can&#146t seem to design a seat that is comfortable for long distances, or include heated & folding side mirrors.  ( one point for Isuzu )  The GM twins strong point is definitely their 4.3L V6 and transmission.  If you like speed and need to tow a reasonable sized trailer, take a closer look at the Blazer/Jimmy twins.

<b>----- Trooper Negatives -----</b>

It&#146s not all roses for the Trooper, and there are some rather annoying issues that plague other Isuzu models.  The geriatric 3.2L engine is actually sourced from GM, and is not what anyone would describe as a modern powerplant.  It has a notorious valvetrain ticking problem that while not a true reliability problem, it can be downright annoying.  

Another problem that has plagued both my <a href="/content_82526768772"><b>Rodeo</b></a> and Trooper is poor quality lock cylinders.  These locks just won&#146t work right, and replacement is somewhat expensive.   You must resort to unlocking other doors and reaching across the truck, or get the cylinders replaced.  

Since the Trooper and the <a href="/content_82526768772"><b>Rodeo</b></a> share the same manual transmission, it&#146s no surprise they share the same parts failures.  The slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fails at around 70-80K miles, and slowly leaks until your clutch won&#146t disengage.  This is exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feels, when the slave cylinder fails you can&#146t get your truck out of gear.  You can put a band-aid on the problem by having someone &#147bleed&#148 your clutch line and get all the air out.  Eventually you&#146ll need to fix it for good though, and it should cost between $250 - $350 to get it repaired.

Gas mileage is surprisingly bad for my Trooper, and I average 14 mpg.  I was getting around 12 for most of the summer, until I put my tires up to their max air pressure.  Now I&#146m getting closer to 17, with a few dips down to 13 or 14.  This can&#146t be considered good mileage by any means, and you don&#146t get the power of a V8 that the mileage suggests you would.  I attribute most of this to the lower gearing and aforementioned barn-like aerodynamics. 

The last problem I must mention is the timing belt noise.  If a Trooper you own or one you are looking at has a loud clacking or tapping noise, it could be the timing belt tensioner.  This is a common problem with these engines around 100K miles, and should be replaced whenever you have your timing belt replaced.  The tensioner is a hydraulic dampened spring that keeps pressure on your timing belt, this removes any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys.  The hydraulic portion fails after so many miles, and causes the tensioner to cycle in and out rapidly.  This can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping, but is significantly cheaper to repair.  Depending on labor costs, you are looking at $350 to $500 for timing belt and tensioner replacement.

<b>----- Final Comments -----</b>

Even though the above negatives may sound daunting, you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas.  The Isuzu&#146s are usually very reliable, and if something fails it&#146s usually a part that won&#146t leave you stranded.  If I had to do it all over again, I would still buy my Trooper, even with its little quirks.  I have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the Trooper offers.  There are several useful Isuzu forums if you have questions about your Trooper, although the Isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking.  I wouldn't say the Trooper is for everyone, but I would give it a strong look along with the other SUVs I have mentioned.  The Trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space.
