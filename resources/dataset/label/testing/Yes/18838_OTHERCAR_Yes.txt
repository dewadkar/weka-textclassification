            I was looking for a digital camera with the ultimate in versatility and ruggedness...I found it in the Panasonic PV-SD4090.  It provides extended memory capability with the SuperDisc 120 MB option, or the ultimate in convenience and flexibility with the 3.5&quot; floppy disk option.  Both fit into the same side loading slot, and can be removed for direct loading into your floppy or SuperDisk drive, or you can download directly from the camera using the USB cable.  I have been extremely impressed with the rugged feel and sturdiness of this camera.  I work in a warehouse distribution center, and carry the camera with me quite a bit.  The frequent banging and jarring haven't hurt it one bit.  The built in lens cover is very nice...no more losing the cover.  When working alone, the timer enables me to set the camera up...move to a place I can point at a specific object in the picture, and still come out with a perfectly exposed picture.  In short, I love this camera!  And so does just about anyone that has seen it.  I've been using Kodak and Sony Cameras for several months, and there's no comparison.  If you're looking for a camera for work, home, school, or play, this is the one for you!  <br><br>
