            I bought my 1997 Geo Prizm in December of 1998. I've been driving it now for over a year, and I still haven't quite tired of it.

This car has been through [heck] and back. And it's still going strong. It served as a nice, functional compact car for several months, but then the real test came: I took a promotion that required me to drive 1 hour and 45 minutes, one-way, every day to work. That's a total of 3.5 hours a day, 1110 miles per week. That went on for over three months. It never missed a beat.

In fact, the only time this car has been in the shop was to have the front tires replaced, purely as preventative maintenance. It's been a real trooper.

This model is pretty comfortable. The seats aren't adorned in leather, they don't have electronic position memories, and they aren't heated. But they're not too bad on the back. Not only were they comfortable enough to be survivable on a 3 1/2 hour commute every day, they even did good on a round-trip road trip to and from Philadelphia from South Carolina (13 hours one-way).

The gas mileage is adequate. It doesn't hit the advertised mark of 37 mpg, but it does get between 25-30 mpg. That's not too bad, especially the way I and my fiancee drive it.

The air-conditioner (a must-have here in the hot, wet South) and the heater take less than two minutes to render the cabin comfortable. And the engine still has decent power even with the AC running full-blast.

My only real complaint about the car is the noise. It's excessive. Engine noise is mild, but the road noise is almost deafening above 50 mph. And the little AM/FM Cassette deck installed by the factory does not reach volumes capable of drowning it out.

But the downsides are not enough to change my opinion of this car as a veritable work-horse. Its reliability has been a valuable asset to me these last several months. Can I guarantee that someone else's experience with this model car will be as positive as mine? No. I know that cars are much like computers in that it's hit or miss whether you get a lemon or a cherry. But I feel some confidence that if my experience is what it has been, the designers of this car did <i>something</i> right.<br><br>
