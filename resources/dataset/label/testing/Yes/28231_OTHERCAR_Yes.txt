            I purchased the 1999 Dodge Durango and was very impressed with its roomy interior and the power that the motor had.  But with that power came very poor gas mileage.  The dealers will tell you that your mpg (miles per gallon) will range from 15 to 17 mpg.  That was completely false.  The actual mileage you will get is 10 to 11 mpg on the highway and 7 or 8 mpg for city driving if you are lucky.  In just one week I drove the Durango about 400 miles and had to fill the gas tank five times.  With a price tag as high as the one they have on this vehicle a common person cannot afford to drive this overrated SUV.  
It was, however, very comfortable to drive as well as fun.  The Durango has plenty of room for the whole family to enjoy.  I loved the Durango for that reason but I was more worried about the fuel economy to fully enjoy the Dodge Durango. <br><br>
