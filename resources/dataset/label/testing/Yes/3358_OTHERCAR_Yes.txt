            In October 2001, I purchased a brand new Nissan Pathfinder LE fully loaded.
I am not going to write statistics since those are available in different magazines and websites.

The Exterior
1. It is very classy, nice rounded edges, and key colored bumpers and mirrors. At the same time, it looks tough durable and solid. The doors are heavy unlike other doors in my Acura Integra where it so light and made with thin sheetmetal. The hood probably weighs 50 lbs in the Pathfinder and insulated to keep the hot air from dissipating in the cabin. The overall exterior construction is so "Range Rover like", solid, durable, and heavy.
2. The wheels could have been designed better but it's okay. The tires are grippy and Nissan didn't cut costs on tires unlike Honda(who uses the least expensive Michelins available) The Toyo tires grips well in wet, and icy conditions. 
3. I just wish it had power antennas.

The Interior.
1. The Pathfinder LE with leather is one of the best interior in the 30k SUV market. The Passport, the 4Runner pales in comparison to the Pathfinder's. The leather is soft, the white gauges with lit needles certainly adds some sportiness and finesse to cockpit. The controls are convenient (radio, temperature, cruise). 
2. The cupholders could have been bigger since it doesn't hole a large drink or slurpee snugly. The center console is sized just right for all your gadgets. The power memory seats are easy to use, I like the large moonroof too.
3. The back seats however, could be roomier.

Performance.
1. The difference between this SUV and it other V6 competitors is that passing a vehicle does not require advance planning. It has plenty of torque available at the low RPMs, and at nearly 7k redline, it also has top end power. 
2. The ride is soft and quiet unlike the 4Runner or the Explorer. The handling is car like in many respects, and it only gives a hint of body roll when turning at moderate speeds.
3. You get a nice view from the driver seat, you see well on both sides and in ther rear. 

At the price we paid 29.7k, it is certainly offers a lot of features, performance, and safety.
The insurance on this vehicle is less than other SUVs comparably priced (4Runner, Passport, Montero Sport, Explorer). I checked with my insurance carrier on how much it will cost with the different SUVs I had in mind before getting this one.
