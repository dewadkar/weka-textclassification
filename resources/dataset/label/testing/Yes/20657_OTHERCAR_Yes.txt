            I bought this car for the luxury/price and performance/price factors and am not the least bit disappointed.  People stopped to talk to me about it before I even left the dealers lot.

The acceleration on this &quot;family sedan&quot; is in sports car territory (0-60 in 6.6 sec.) while the ride is forgiving.  With all wheel drive and plenty of room for four large adults this is the perfect car for someone in the Northeast who likes a fun and exciting ride but needs to be practical. 

The other strong point is, it's a luxury vehicle that is not ostentatious.  It does not come with the &quot;in your face marquis&quot; of BMW or Mercedes.  A quiet, practical rocket.  Perfect.  <br><br>
