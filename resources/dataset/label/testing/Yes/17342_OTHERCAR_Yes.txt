            My girlfriend and I recently bought a top of the line Honda Accord EX with the V6 engine.  The car comes fully-loaded with leather seats, 6 DC changer, moonroof, keyless entry, ABS brakes with front and rear disc brakes, as well as a lot of other features.

We decided to buy the Accord mainly because of Honda's reputation for building high quality automobiles, but we were also looking for good performance, thoughtful design and a reasonable price.

Quality: the quality of the Accord is evident both inside and out.  Walking around the car, one can notice the precise build quality in the details: from the even spacing between body panels to the way the paint is perfect from all angles.  Upon sitting in the car, one notices the high-grade plastics and fabrics used throughout, especially when comparing the Accord to most of its competitors (ie. the Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Ford Taurus).  Before purchasing the car, we spoke to numerous friends who currently own Accords and report no reliability problems at all.  We expect that this car will easily last 5-6 years without costing us too much in maintenance costs.

Performance: we opted for the V6 engine because we wanted more performance.  At 200 hp, the engine is powerful, especially considering the fact that the Accord is relatively light for a mid-sized car, and generally revs smoothly.  The 4 speed automatic shifter performs adequately under most driving conditions.  However, there is a noticeable lag as you wait for the car to downshift when pressing hard on the accelerator.  This lag time simply confirms that the Accord is aimed more toward comfort than performance (if you want real performance with an automatic, consider a Mercedes or BMW).  Considering that the car doesn't have a sport package and is not tuned for performance driving, the car corners very well despite its soft springs and 15 inch tires.  The steering is a bit overboosted, especially at slow speeds.  This car is obviously not designed to be a performance car.  It is a car that performs relatively well.

Design: the Accord is obviously designed for the mainstream car audience.  Like a good suit, the Accord is the type of car that won't go out of style, even if the next revised model comes out in a couple of years.  It certainly won't win any beauty contests, but it also won't offend anyone.
Inside, the Accord is thoughtfully designed.  The instruments are large and well-lit at night.  The climate controls and radio are easy to figure out and use.  The CD changer houses 6 cds at once and consists of one slot through which you insert cds one at a time.  This system is much better than most, which require a trunk or glovebox mounted cd changer.  A large amount of glass also helps the driver to have a great view of everything around the car.  The only complaints I have about the interior are that the seats don't provide enough support on the bottom and the fake wood inserts look very fake (it would be better to use real wood or just just regular-looking plastic).

Price: the list price for the car is $25,100.  There are no options to purchase other than special dealer-installed ones (which we were not interested in).  We were able to buy the car for $22,924, which is only $150 above invoice.  In addition, Honda is running a special financing package of 3.9% financing for 3 years, which is incredibly low.  We suspect that we got a great price because the dealer wanted to move the car quickly given the slowing economy and large inventory on its lot.

Overall, we are very happy so far with our new Accord EX.  Compared to similar cars in its class, this car (along with the Camry) stands out from the others (we bought the Accord instead of the Camry because we liked its design better and because we got a better deal) and I highly recommend it.
