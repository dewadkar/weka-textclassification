            I bought mine in August of 1999 and have loved it so far. It could be better on milage, but I don't commute on a daily basis, back and forth to work, so that didn't matter that much to me.

I originally planned on buying a Honda CRV but they were hard to come by in my area this year and the dealers wouldn't give me the deal I was looking for. So I went and test drove the Kia. 

I loved it. In many ways it was just like the CRV, only the Kia dealer was willing to work with me in getting the best price and trade in for my other vehicle. I've bought new cars in the past, but never had as much fun as I did buying the Kia. I was able to drive the vehicle home the same day I took it for the test drive.

My main reason for wanting an SUV was to have a vehicle that had room in the back for my constant companion, my dog. And the power windows make it a breeze to adjust the windows for her when we're traveling.
I keep one of the back seats up and the other down to allow her the room to either sit at a window or move to the back of the car to sleep.

One of the major irritations, to me, is where they put the lever that opens the gas cap. It's next to the drivers seat, right where your leg leans while driving. This tends to jab and stick into my leg. As a result, I had to adapt a cushion to go over the lever that still allows me to use it when I fill up the gas.

My only other concern, might be the outside wheel casing and holder. I haven't had the car long enough, but I'm worried that this might be the first thing that starts to give out as I use it constantly loading and unloading groceries and stuff. 

All and all, I love it. It handles very well, whether I'm driving on pavement or dirt roads and trails.
I haven't used the 4w drive option yet, but I expect it to perform well when the snow starts later this winter.
Last night I did some highway driving with wind gusts to 40 mph and was very pleased with the way it behaved.

June 2000 update,
I've since had the opportunity to use the 4w drive option during a couple of heavy snowstorms in my area and on a slippery, steep dirt road. And I'm happy to say the traction was great. It was hard to get into 4w drive the first time, but ever since it's slipped in much easier.

I'm not too happy about the brake dust that forms on the front wheel hubs.
When I brought it in to have this checked I was told that this is common with the type of hubs on my SUV and other cars. It was mentioned that you could buy plastic guards that go between the brakes and the hub to prevent this from happening. Seems to me that if they know it's going to happen, they would provide the guards to begin with. It's just an annoyance, but it does bother me, because the front wheels are always such a mess.

I'm driving a greater distance now, due to a different job, and it's not very good on gas.

Over all though, I still love it and I'm glad I got it.
