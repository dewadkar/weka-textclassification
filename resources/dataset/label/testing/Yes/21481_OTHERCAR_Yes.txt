            Want to feel like you are driving a very expensive automobile at a reasonable cost, want to feel like you have power in the palm of your hand, and do you want to feel young again?  If you do, then drive a Pontiac Grand Prix.  I bought it because when I drove it, I felt like I could corner anything, weave in and out of traffic with no worries, pass a semi on a two lane road easily with enough power that when you hit the pedal, you feel it and you hear the power behind it.  This has been the best car I have ever owned, and everyday I drive it, I love it even more.  The seats are comfortable, it has a large back seat area with plenty of leg room for adults even.  My son loves to ride in it, and all of his friends think his mom is &quot;cool&quot; in her car.  

I have taken this car on vacation twice, and we always had plenty of room for everyone and their luggage, and even the dog. I have recommended this car to several people I know and those who have bought one love theirs too.  Way to go Pontiac!!!!
