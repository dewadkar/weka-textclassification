            Just as the title suggests, I made my first foray into the upscale auto market as I took my first steps in eBay Auto.  Locally, 1999 TL's were going for three to four thousand dollars more.  So, I rolled the dice, with the deal and the car, proving it a move well worth the gamble!

My car came from a vehicle wholesaler, not a dealership.  I was afforded excellent attention and very satisfactory service, but as one would guess when you do not buy from a dealership, you don't necessarily receive the car in showroom condition.  My car was fairly clean, but in need of some elbow grease nonetheless.

Once duly polished and shown-off though, this car is truly a pearl!  The vehicle's finish is top-notch, even and smooth throughout.  The lines of the car offer an aggressive yet subdued personality.  I really appreciate that about the car.  It doesn't scream, "look at me!"  Instead, it offers beauty and class with a tempered personality.  

Inside, the luxurious leather appointments are very nice to the eye and to the touch.  The seats are very comfortable and easily made so with the variety of positions afforded with the electric adjustment knobs.  The fact that the front seats are also heated, tops them off very nicely indeed.  Memory for different drivers' seat positions would be nice, but I'm not complaining.  The back seat offers plenty of room and comfort for 3 average sized adults.  Leg room, even for the taller drivers and passengers, is acceptable.  Instruments and accessories are all well laid out and reasonably placed.  The stereo/CD player are very good.  Nice, robust sound, good reception, with the speakers able to handle respectable bass levels.  Topping off the interior niceties is the quiet cabin.  Road noises are hushed very nicely, leaving the driver feeling a sense of detachment from the harsh outside world.  With the Christmas season upon us and the shopping reaching a feverish pitch, the roominess of the trunk has been duly tested.  We sold our minivan before purchasing this car.  Now, I'm not about to say that this car can store as much as the minivan... but let me just say that I am more than moderately impressed with the room afforded.  

The engine is fantastic.  225 horses that deliver smooth, crisp power.  The car is not a sports car by any means, but it does offer more than enough go while cradling you in pampered style.  Handling is responsive with the fairly stiff suspension and uneven pavement is absorbed admirably, acceptably muting even the bumpiest of roads.

My car had arrived already thoroughly broken in.  After all, I did buy it used with almost 62,000 miles on it.  I mention the miles because the most impressive thing that I can think to say of my TL is that is still looks, rides, and performs as if it were brand new.  I also have a 1994 Honda Civic, that car has 140,000 miles and climbing, and it still runs, looks, and rides very well in it's own right.  With the confidence in Honda's engines already earned, I really do believe that my Acura has only begun to warm up!  As a matter of fact, a friend of mine who was so impressed with my car, went out and bought his own 1999 TL locally.  His car has only 25,000 miles on it but from looking at both of our cars and then driving them, you couldn't ever tell the difference in mileage; attesting to the fact that these cars are built to last a long, long time.

In summary, this is a terrific car for the money.  Definitely more bang for the buck in comparison with competing brands and models.  There may be some more exotic, and perhaps sexier offerings out there, but with all things considered... the Acura 3.2 TL is something very, very special.  It offers all the quality and performance that I could ever ask for in a vehicle, and not so insignificantly, the company boasts an impressive reliability record that has earned my trust completely.
