            Question: What is the best Sports Utility Vehicle I could get for under $30,000?
Answer: The Nissan Pathfinder.
      
    This is honestly one of the best cars I've ever owned.  As soon as I took it for a test drive I knew it was the one I wanted for these reasons:

1.On the road, I could see other people just looking at the beauty of my car.

2. It never, even once, broke down in the year and a half that I've had it.

3. The leather on the inside was extremely comfortable.

These reasons among other things is why I bought this great car.

I bought this car in early 1998 and the exact model was a 1999 LE 4WD 4 Dr Sport Utility. If u have about 30,000 dollars to spend, this is the very best way to spend it.
