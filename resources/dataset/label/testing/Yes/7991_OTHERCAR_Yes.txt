            The Volvo S80 first arrived on our shores in 1999 as Volvo's flagship.  It replaced the boxy (yet luxurious), S90 sedan.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: This is truly, a "ReVOLVOlution".  Volvo finally decided to update their new cars with very remarkable styling.  A far cry from the arachaic box that used to plague sales.  Ford's financial influence is likely to be the main cause of many of the restyles.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The cabin is very spacious.  There plenty of leg room front and rear, and with 8-way adjustable front seats, there's no excuse for being uncomfortable.  Although Volvo claims the S80 will hold 5 passengers (2 front, 3 rear), 2 people will find it more comfortable in the rear for long trips.  The audio control functions are somewhat difficult to use at first.  The navigation system is relatively hard to read because of it's strange location.  The side mirrors are too small creating blind spots.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The S80 is available with 2 different engine options.  You can choose between a 2.9-liter naturally-aspirated 197-horsepower inline 6-cylinder engine.  It produces only 207 lb./ft. of torque at a relatively high 4,200 rpms.  For a 3,650-pound luxury car more torque would be nice and at a lower rpms, but the engine is more than adequate (and faster than an Acura RL!) for everyday use.  The engine is mated to a smooth-shifting electronically-controlled 4-speed automatic transmission.  Although Ford owns Volvo, the transmission was actually made in conjunction with General Motors.  With the mandatory premium fuel, I averaged 19.9 mpg.

<b>HANDLING</b>: Despite the heft, the S80 is actually quite agile for such a large car.  The steering however, as expected with most luxury cars, feels like it was injected with an anesthetic.  The S80's brakes stop the car very quickly and with little nosedive.  In everyday use, however, the brake pedal feels either too soft, or too hard...there's no middle ground.

<b>RIDE</b>: One of the S80's best features.  In normal driving conditions, it rides as if it were on a cloud.  It never floats over bumps, it just absorbs them.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Although Volvo's have staked their claim-to-fame in the safety department, it seems to me that Volvo has skimped somewhat on reliability.  My father (the owner of the car) has been in and out of the shop with various suspension, and electronic problems.

<b>VALUE</b>: Reliability issues aside, this is one of the best (midsize) luxury cars you can buy for your money.  If safety is your concern and you want to ride in style, this new Volvo S80 is the perfect car for you!
