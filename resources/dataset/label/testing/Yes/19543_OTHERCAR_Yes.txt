            I drove compact cars for several years mainly for economic reasons, and I was satisfied and thought I would drive economy cars the rest of my life. But my boyfriend told me about this 1988 Monte Carlo for sale - 1 owner garage kept and in excellent condition. I liked the look of the 1988. It is the LS model, V8, kind of a silver gray with gray interior. The look is not what sold me though, because I really thought I was still looking for a compact car, but I drove it to show my boyfriend that I would consider the car. I hadn't been on the road 30 seconds before I said "wow, I like this car, I like feeling the POWER!". It is by far the best car I have ever owned. I drive it every day and I can't say anything negative about it. It handles well on highway or country roads. It handles curves wonderfully. It has been the most dependable car I've ever owned too. My Monte has 146,000 miles on it and I will drive it until its all used up and then I'll probably look for another one to buy. My boyfriend is now my husband and he loves the car too. It has enough room to load all 4 kids in it but I don't feel like a car pool mom when I drive it - I feel like I'm in a race car, and I have been accused of driving like it too.  I like the power of a V8. I'll never drive a compact car again.
