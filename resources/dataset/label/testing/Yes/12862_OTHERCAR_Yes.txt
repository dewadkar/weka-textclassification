            I bought a Buick Century and loved that car... used it till it plumb wore out. The car looked great, felt great, rode great... had no problems with it for the longest time. The steering wheel had a great feel, easy maneuverability. The seats were cloth and comfortable and easy to adjust. The sound system was wonderful..had a tape player too. The environmental controls were easy to maneuver and responsive to changes. The car drove wonderfully. The downside was that the motor was a little on the loud side. My husband would say that he could hear me coming before I actually arrived. The trunk room was ample. We packed for many a trip in that car. 
It traveled over 100,000 miles before we bid her goodbye. If you have never had a Buick, try a Century and you will be glad you did. <br><br>
