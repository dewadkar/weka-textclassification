            My father bought a 1990 Lexus LS400, the first year they were available.  He leased it as a company car, and is still driving it to this day, years after the lease expired.

Honest to God, we have NEVER had a problem with this car.  Nothing.  Zero.  Zip.  The battery died once--AAA came, and it's never happened again.  Literally, this car has not spent a day of its life in the shop for a mechanical or electrical failure (it was in an accident, though).

My father is driving this car everyday, even 9 years later.  What's more, the styling is so classic that people can't really tell that his car dates from 1990.  You'd see it on the street, and it looks new.

The point: this car will give you trouble-free performance for as long as you own it.

Speaking of performance, the acceleration of the 250 HP V8 is phenomenal--it literally rams you back against the (comfortable) seats.  Also, it is one of the few V8's not subject to the gas guzzler tax, because it's gas mileage is so good (at least in our model).

What's more amazing is how quiet the car is.  You can be going along at 75 mph, and not hear a sound from outside the car.  Which doesn't hurt, when you're listening to the stereo.  If you are sitting in park with the car turned on, you literally will forget the engine is on it's so quiet.

Lexus has introduced a lot of new features since 1990, including dual heating systems, and all kinds of other cool stuff.  But the basic model remains invincible.

I literally begged my father to let me drive that car.  He finally relented, but only for an afternoon.

I am told that this is what Bill Gates drives.  What's good enough for Bill is good enough for me.<br><br>
