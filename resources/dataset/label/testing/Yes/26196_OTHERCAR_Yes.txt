            Performance:
I have the 1.8T sedan with a stick. Driving it is a blast, though there are now cars in its price range coming that are beginning to match it. If you get a auto, people recommend the V6.

Fuel Economy:
I get around 31mpg on the highway at 80mph. At 60-65, it can average as high as 35mpg. Pretty good, but it does require premium.

Comfort:
Very comfortable seats and a very quite car. It is actually quieter than its sister car the Audi A4. The car is a bit softer sprung which makes it more comfortable than the A4, but its handling is not as sharp and it leans more during turns. However, it is far superior to an Accord, Camry or Taurus which feel like boats at high speeds.

Reliabilty/Quality:
So far I've not had any problems. However it is only in its first year with 15K.

Warranty:
For added piece of mind I paid an additional $900 to get a 5 year extended warranty. I just hope the warranty is as good as it claims to be.

Interior:
Perhaps the best part of the car. The tactile feel of switches and the textures of the interiors matches higher price cars such as BMW and Mercedes. Only wished it came with a CD player as standard. Who uses cassettes anymore?

Summary:
A great car, although some newer cars like the Nissan Altima may give it a run for its money, specially in its V6 guise. As the saying goes, if you want a "car" (=fun to drive, has personality, but may be less reliable and more costly to own), you buy a Passat. If you want an "appliance" (= good, reliable, cheap, boring, cookie cutterish), you should get a camry or a accord. The 2001 Altima may be something in the middle.
