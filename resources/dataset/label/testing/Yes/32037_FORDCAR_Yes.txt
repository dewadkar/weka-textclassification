            The accurate facts are that I have had this car since May 96. Brand new and very beautiful! Alaska is notoriously hard on vehicles but this one has been great!  We live in a town where most of the streets are hills and very steep ones at that.  This car in the snow is great! The Auto 4 Wheel function is my favorite feature as you can just turn it on and off with out doing anything special.  When it is snowing we just leave it in the Auto 4 wheel and whenever the car senses that the wheels are slipping it goes in 4 wheel drive.  But otherwise it just stays in 2 wheel.  It also has a 4 Wheel Low but that has to be put in Neutral to initiate that function.  We get around and up those hills with no problem!  We bought this vehicle because of the roads and snow. I love the bench seat we got because of the firmness of the seats and it is so much better on the back that the Bucket seats. Also in a bind we can put another person in the middle as it does have a seat belt. The console unscrews and comes off to accommodate that feature. The console is what I don't like, it just is not very convenient. Driving it is so much better, smoother, than my daughter's Jeep. But I probably would not buy this car if I lived in a city without snow or otherwise hilly roads. In 3 years we have never had it in a shop except for regular scheduled maintenance. Also we had our own running boards installed not the ones factory installed as they don't help much!  

This is July 2002.  We have had this car for 6 years and I stand by the review that I wrote way back then! We have only had to keep up the maintenance of the car and just this year had to put new brakes on. Other than that there has been no problems. It has still the beautiful finish that it had when new but then I have always kept up on the upkeep.
