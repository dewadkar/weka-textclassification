            <b>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO I AM:</b>
<i>And why I only review suspension and steering systems.</i>


       I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. <i>I have been a State of Michigan certified steering and suspension technician for almost 15 years, and certified in other areas for over 22.</i> After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for from the advisors here at epinions, and make your choice.

<b>NOW THE GOOD STUFF ON THE MAZDA 626/MX6, FRONT AND REAR:</b>

To start off with, In my opinion the Mazda 626/MX6 is a very well engineered and built automobile suspension.  It really isn't anything special, nothing extremely high tech, but sometimes that isn't such a bad thing, and this is just one of those times.  What you have in the 626/MX6 is a complete, albeit basic four wheel independent suspension.

 Gas charged MacPherson struts grace all four corners, with coils doing the springing duties, and an admirable job at that. Not too heavy duty stiff, but not pen spring weak either.<i>(can you say Ford Contour) ?</i>  You get just the right amount of rebound to keep you comfortable while Sunday driving, and also just enough for the occasional jaunt through the twistys to let you know this car isn't just about granny and grocery getting. 

To keep things leveled out during that cornering, Mazda gives you a small but effective anti-roll bar system front and rear. Nothing to write home about, but better than nothing at all.

As with almost every other mid priced car on the market today, there is not much preventive maintenance  you can perform on these vehicles steering systems. The lower ball joints as well as the outer tie rods are not greasable, but again as with most other Japanese engineered vehicles the quality is built in so there is not much you need to worry about until extremely high mileage presents itself.

Everything holds up very well, with the angles of operation seeming to promote long life and minimal wear on the front end parts. Steering is  very light and predictable, while the steering radius sharp enough to fit into tightly spaced parking spots on the first try.

 I have not had the pleasure many times at all to write estimates on front end re-builds for the Mazda 626/MX6 which is a testament to the excellent research and development this corporation has in place, (and most other Japanese auto companies as well.)

<b>Hint to American car manufacturers:</b>
<i>Find out what the Japanese are doing and copy it for your domestic steering and suspension systems. It's not too late and nobody will hold it against you.</i>

<b>ALIGNMENT CAPABILITIES:</b>

The front end alignment on these models is adjustable via an offset upper strut mount. This will limit not only the amount of adjustment available, but the fact that the caster and camber angles will not be able to be set apart from each other. This shouldn't be a problem unless an accident or hard blow has occurred, then you may end up with having to choose between matching camber to spec. to minimize tire wear, or caster to cure a pull. <i>This just means be careful around curbs and pot holes.</i>

An intelligent threaded rear link will give you rear toe in/out adjustment. Though this is the only actual factory adjustment, kits are available for rear camber adjustment should the need arise after the springs have weakened with age and stress from mileage.

<b>IN GENERAL:</b>

The 626 and consequently the MX6 when it came out have gone through somewhat of a metamorphosis in it's life. Every few years Mazda had re-designed it, but upon each subsequent change came quantum improvements. '79-'82, '83-'87, '88-'92, '93-'97, and all the way to present time each consecutive change in design begot better and higher quality components and a more stable and dependable suspension and steering system.

Read some other reviews on these cars from some of the advisors here on epinions, dealing with the engine, transmission, interior etc. You needn't give the under car area another thought. Mazda and I have your back there !
