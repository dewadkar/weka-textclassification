            I love my car.

My '93 blue Geo Metro is the perfect car to suit me. I am an 18 year old short-on-cash suburban high school senior. I can't afford anything. I take out loans to buy toilet paper. And for my needs, this car has lasted me for three good years of high school. It is small, and yet there is plenty of leg room for a 6 foot tall driver. It is incredibly fun to drive, almost like a golf cart. My friends constantly beg me to drive my car. I feel odd driving anything bigger - but I LIKE that feeling. 

Do NOT buy this car for luxury or high quality parts. My Geo could've been put together with Lego's, but the plus side to that is you can usually put things that fall off back on. I have had to fix a few things, but nothing major. My car always starts, no matter the temperature, and the gas mileage is outstanding. I like the fact that I can drive for two days after the needle hits the E. 

Again, do NOT buy this vehicle for use as a family car. I have managed to fit eight people in it, but that was just ridiculous. Four people can be fit with a minimal amount of comfort for those unlucky few in the back, but that is not of the driver's concern. The ideal driver for this car is someone who loves to drive but has minimal cash flow. 

Like me.<br><br>
