            DODGE RAM: RAM TOUGH.
     Let's get straight to the point:  The RAM is a great truck with few flaws (although there are a few).  
     I bought my '99 Ram in August of the same year.  Features included: 360 V8, Sport Package, 4x4 (you gotta have that if you're going to buy a truck!), power everything, Infinity CD, Quad Cab, bedliner (authentic Dodge), Trailer Tow Package, and Alarm System (authentic Chrysler). 
     What is great about the Dodge Truck is the POWER!.  A 318 will do the job (I drove one before I bought my 360), but opt for the 360 (I believe it is a free option for year 2000 models).  The acceleration is great and the sound of it is even greater (this puppy roars when you put the hammer down!).  The interior is top-grade.  Everything is within reach and well placed.  Storage is at a premium and comfort is unmatched.  The quad cab feature is one of the greatest truck innovations on the market.  I recommend w/o any reservations over the &quot;extended cab.&quot;  The factory alarm is simple to use and cheap to opt for.  The bedliner (real dodge liner) can be over or under the rail (take over the rail or you're crazy!)--what's cool is cup holders on the tailgate portion of the liner for &quot;tailgate parties&quot; (these engineers thought of everything?)
     Or did they?  The tranny on my Dodge feels weak.  I don't feel like I have a tight connection.  The tranny winds up when I accelerate and doesn't feel like it is putting all 245 horses on the ground.  Besides that, the tranny likes to whistle at me when it is cold in the morning and I put in reverse (but only cold and in reverse).  Several Dodge &quot;technicians&quot; told me this is nothing to worry about.  Another complaint I have is the Infinity sound system.  This cheezy thing is rated at 66 watts (I think my clock radio puts out more power) and yet they charged me $490 for that option.  I wish I would have known before I bought the truck--I could put in that quality of system for about 200 or three hundred bucks (if even that much).
     All together though, this is a great truck.  I saved about $4500 below retail price at my dealer--these guys want to sell their trucks.  I tried to deal with Toyota on a Tundra and they told me that they didn't need to deal b/c they sell too many trucks as it is--well, I didn't buy one and they don't outsell any of the domestics.  Buy a Dodge and you won't be disappointed!
