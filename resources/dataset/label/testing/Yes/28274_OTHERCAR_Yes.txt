            We purchased our Durango in July 99'.  Before that we had a 97' Plymouth Voyager.  The difference is unbelievable.  When I put my children into the Durango I feel like we are in a tank.  It is so sturdy and solid.  The Durango holds the road similar to a race car, it doesn't feel top heavy as the van did.  The power is amazing. I'm not afraid to pull out at bad intersections because the Durango engine has more than enough power to pull it's solid body. I don't feel like I'm in a tin can that would be smashed if we were to collide with another vehicle.  I love this vehicle more than any others we have purchased.  The features such as automatic door locks, air bags, etc.  give it an extra safe feeling when I put my children and grandchild inside.  The only complaint I would have would be the gas mileage.  If I fill up ($30 every 5 days) it must be with high test gasoline or I notice a significant difference in it's power.  My Durango loves gasoline and calling it a gas hog is an understatement.  But the benefits of safety are well worth it.  To own this car is expensive, tires are outrageous. In fact we bought our Durango at Solomon in Carmichaels, the car dealer actually took the tires off that it was shipped with and put car tires on it.  When that was corrected there was a great difference.  Also the blind spot between the windshield and side windows is too large so we really must look twice or three times to get past it.<br><br>
