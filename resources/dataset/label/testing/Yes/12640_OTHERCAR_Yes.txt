            I started looking for a digital camera early this summer, and after looking at several in the store and reading several epinions, I chose the Canon PowerShot S10. Highest-rated on Epinions (which i use for all of my shopping information on what and more importantly where to buy!)

It was a great choice.

In the last 6 mos I have taken over 200 great pictures, which more than I took over the last 10 years before I had the Canon PowerShot S10. 

This camera is lightweight, small and easy-to-use. It is even semi-water resistant! A few weekends ago on a camping trip I fell into the river in the excitement of my boyfriend catching a huge fish, and the camera somehow survived being fully submerged into the water! It still works perfectly, and I even managed to salvage the pictures I had taken before the face plant...

The only piece of criticism I have for this camera is that the battery life is very short -- always have a few charged backup batteries on hand when you take this camera out.

Otherwise, it is a great investment and I concur with everyone else on Epinions who has reccommended it as a great purchase. 

I bought mine on Buy.com for about $400, but I am sure you can get it cheaper now. Epinions will show you where to get the best deal.
