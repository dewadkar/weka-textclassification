            We have just spent a wonderful first month in our Ford Expedition. It is a world away from our Explorer.

The Expedition's size is big, yes. But the ride is smooth, the turning radius tight and the cargo space lush. Big enough for the following items: 2 large suitcases, large stroller, 12 bags of groceries, a potted plant and a case of sodas. A strange haul, yes, but if you're like me, stuff tends to &quot;hang out&quot; in the car for a day or two at times.

The comfort level of the seats compared to the Explorer are like night and day. My back hurt on a daily basis in our Explorer, and I have not had a twinge in the Expedition. The floor pedals even electronically adjust to fit short people! What a great concept that I think makes a ton of difference. There is plenty of leg room in front and in back, although there is something about the design on the center console that inches in on whoever is sitting in the center of the back seat (so put your short legged friends there). I don't care for the mesh pockets behind the front seats, as my stuff is always falling out, but it's an improvement over the Explorer's stiff vinyl pockets that virtually ate everything I slipped in there. 

The fuel economy is marginal, but not bad. I drive an average of 50 miles a day and fill up once a week at a cost of $32. It does not sip or drink gas, it slurps it up. You can practically hear the stuff draining out of the tank. The ride is fantastic, though. I often look down to see myself flying down the highway at 85! And I'm not usually much of a speeder, so be careful.

The price is a better deal, by far, over the Explorer. For $5,000 more than what we paid for the 1999 XLT Explorer two months ago (we traded it back in: see my Explorer review), we got the Expedition Eddie Bauer Package with all sorts of goodies like signal mirrors (you don't realize how great they are till you've got them), tow package, dual A/C (a MUST in TX), cupholders galore, suitcase sized glovebox and center console. 

My only complaints so far are petty, but truly irritating at times. With an infant seat in the back, center positioned, there are no cupholders....Ahhhh. Yes, they are located in the seat in an armrest that folds down. I bet it's really nice for you lucky folks who don't need carseats:). More irritating, however, is the fact that there is only ONE keyhole in ONE door, the driver's side. Many a time I have headed to the driver's door with a package for the front seat and had to jog around to unlock the car. A key fob is provided with a auto unlock button, but my husband's keys don't have it on there and I'm always losing my keys....so this probably won't bug you as much as me :) 

All in all, my complaints are petty. We absolutely love our new truck and are confidant that we made a great decision. To get the best price, BE SURE to go to edmunds.com and get the invoice pricing for the truck AND the options before heading to the dealership. We saved a bundle this way (on both the Explorer and the Expedition). Right now, there is even 0.9% financing on both, so what are you waiting for?<br><br>
