            First of all, lets start out with basic specs: 

1.3 Megapixels
4MB Memorystick (expandable up to 64MB)
2" LCD screen
6x Digital Zoom
3x Optical Zoom

Physically, I found the camera to be pretty good sized. It's larger than you average 35mm camera, but I wouldn't call it bulky by any means. Of course, Sony has recently been miniturizing their latest Cybershot models, but I have never had a problem with this one when it comes to size. My favorite feature on this camera is the swiveling LCD screen. Not only does it protect the screen by keeping it from being exposed, it also allows you position it in such a way that it's facing the subject - perfect for taking pictures of yourself! Buttons tend to be somewhat small, especially the zoom buttons, but considering that it's equipped with a 2" LCD screen, it's understandable. 

Manipulating the camera is pretty easy as well. A menu is organized on screen and using the pad to the right of the screen allows you to highlight different menu settings, pushing down on the button serves to select the highlighted menu. The menu itself is moderately extensive including features like selecting your image size, setting up the camera, or taking special pictures, like black and white or sepia for that old photograph look. 

What's not included in the menu is in button form around the the LCD display, such as flash, zoom, etc. For those photographers that don't like traditional point and click cameras that have autofocus features, the DSC-30 allows you to set the focus to your liking (but for amateurs like me, auto-focus is still available). The same goes with the aperture settings which help for taking pictures without the flash so that you get clear photos without losing artificial lighting. 

As mentioned earlier, I used this camera initially for eBay auctions. I needed the files small, so setting the image size of the pictures at 640 x 480 produced stunning quality. I was very surprised. Afterwards I decided that I should test how well regular picture taking fared. Again, I was very pleased. Taking pictures at high resolutions produced even better pictures, which came up beautifully when printed. My only gripe is trying to take pictures in low light. If you're using the flash, this isn't a problem but I often like to keep the picture faithful to the actual scene by maintaining the ambiance of the scenery to be shot. But when I do this, the pictures still turn out a tad blurry and dark compared to taking pictures in normal light conditions. Adjusting aperture settings helps, but doesn't clear it up completely. Regardless, the images are far better than 35mm or Advantix.

Storagewise, the MemoryStick format has a lot going for it. It's very small, and reliable. I recommend buying a 64MB MemoryStick. You'll find the 4MB stick already included to be adequate initially, but taking pictures at higher image settings fill the stick very quickly. The 64MB stick is price (around $100) but you won't have to worry about running out of room for awhile. At least until you get back to your computer, which the USB interface come in handy. Transferring from stick to PC is not only easy, but fast. Also worth mentioning is the video cable that allows you to connect your camera to any TV with A/V jacks for picture viewing. 

If you want to be nitpicky, the DSC-30 has some problem points the main gripe being the absence of a traditional viewfinder. It takes some getting used to using the LCD as your viewfinder. Actually, you'll probably stick your eye right up to the LCD screen just out of force of habit. But you'll get used to it. Though the biggest problem from using the LCD to take pictures instead of a viewfinder is trying to snap pictures of moving objects. The delay between pressing the shutter button and it actually capturing the image is a couple of seconds. Taking that into affect when trying to get a shot of a moving object is tough.  

Overall, I'm very pleased with my camera. I'd don't consider myself to be an amateur point-and-click picture taker, but at the same time I don't don't need the features of a professional camera. This camera is just that. It's perfect for the average picture taker that knows enough about messing with settings to get better pictures. And the price tag is in the right place (last time I checked, around $400). Currently digital cameras have reached the 3.1 megapixel range, but if you're an average picture taker like me, you probably won't need that much power. All in all an excellent buy and I high recommend it.
