            We purchased this minivan when I was pregnant with my second child.  Actually, we initially purchased the Grand Voyager, but we exchanged it the next day because I thought the Grand looked like the Love Boat (ours was white).  I must say it is very hard to go from driving a little sports car to driving a minivan!  Well, we all adjusted and are generally very happy with our van.  

It is much easier to accelerate, corner and park than the Grand, which is very important when you live downtown in a large city like we do.  We had only one minor problem with the van when the horn went out after about nine months of ownership.  It was not a big problem, the dealer repaired it (for free, of course) and we have had no problems with any aspect of the van since.  It gave us a good deal of warning before it finally died, so if your horn starts fading and groaning a bit, you'd better bring the van to be repaired! 

The interior of the van is very quiet (provided your kids are not screaming!). The stereo system works very well. The captain's chairs are comfortable, and the 3rd row seat is probably comfortable enough for a child, but not great for an adult riding for long distances.

One problem with the Voyager which you would not have with the Grand is leg room.  When you have children with booster seats and infant car seats, it is very difficult to arrange the van's seats so that there is adequate leg room on all three rows.  Also, you will probably need a turtle for those vacations to the beach if you bring a lot of "stuff" because there is not much room in the luggage area.  One other problem that we have had is that the seats, particularly the third seat, is very heavy.  It nearly gave my husband a hernia taking it out!  It really takes two men to do it safely.

This van is certainly not van utopia.  However, despite its faults, we do love it, and it is a very good value (compare its price to that of import minivans!).  I would strongly recommend it for city dwellers and those who can't quite bring themselves to buying one of those huge minivans!!
