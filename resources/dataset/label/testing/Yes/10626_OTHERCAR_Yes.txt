            I am an employee with Thrifty Car rental an we have had our Daewoo Leganzas for a while now.  At first look on the exterior it is a pretty sharp car and the paint holds up on them really well. None of them have faded or shown too much damage even for being washed daily. 

Now you all know from your experiences that rental cars are not driven like normal cars.  They are thrown into gear, and tested by each driver to its limits, not a good thing for the cars.  Nevertheless the Daewoo leganza has held up mechanically to all of the beating.  Considering the fact that the rentals are also neglected in their maintenence (i.e. going 6,000 miles before an oil change, sometimes 8-10,000 miles) they haven't had anything go wrong them.  The first time I drove the rental I thought that the car handled somewhat poorly and the interior did not have a &quot;Friendly&quot; atmosphere.  Later I found out that the leganza I drove was a stripped down SE version with automatic transmission and had some ugly cloth interior.  The rentals are what I like to call &quot;Tank&quot; cars, very reliable but not very comfortable.  After the first drive I did not like the car because of the interior and it ruined the whole idea of owning one for myself, until I drove a brand new CDX version with all of the bells and whistles.

After my episode with the rental cars I pretty much had the idea that these are bad cars.  Then one day I drove a brand new CDX version.  The CDX had all that I had been yearning for in the SE version.  The CDX was very comfortable and had a &quot;Friendly&quot; atmosphere and the steering was unbeatable (Variable power assisted).  With its leather seats with lumbar controls on both driver and passenger, power driver seat and wooden trim the inside looked great.  The climate control heating and A/C was stylish and the radio had been dramatically improved with the factory equalizer and trunk 6 CD changer.  I fell in love with the CDX and you know what, I bought one, the same one the salesperson had let me drive around for a few hours.

As soon as I got my Daewoo home I said to myself &quot;How do you work this equalizer thing.&quot;  After it took me a little while I said to myself this car has a better stereo that my 1995 Toyota Avalon (Toyota's flagship car) and yet is more cost effective.  I love the gas mileage and as a volunteer firefighter this car has enough pep for me.  My new Daewoo is great and I encourage all of you to buy one, but don't buy anything less than the CDX.  Also if you have gotten one as a rental, take it from me please don't judge Daewoo for it's neglected SE, or SX versions.  <br><br>
