            Time to finally buy a new car with all that epinions money I've earned :)  Okay... maybe not with the epinions money (good for only a couple of tank fill ups at the station).  It was time to treat myself with a nice car that had good performance and could also spoil me as well.  I didn't need a ridiculously overpowered supercharged car but one that I could drive around from place to place while feeling good driving.

I've always heard about the reliability of Lexus vehicles from friends and traveled in some of their Lexus cars... usually a LS430 as of late.  I could only think of how quiet and powerful the ride was... the ride was also smooth and luxurious feel was pampering.  I truly enjoyed driving around in my friends' LS430s.

I bought the 2001 GS300 recently since I didn't desire a v8 engine and the amount of gas it wasted.  I also had no desire to surpass $50,000 on purchasing a car.  So before taxes and the LoJack, I was able to negotiate a price of $39,000 for a Lexus GS300 2001 edition as the 2002 editions were coming to market.  This is with the Premium package of leather heated seats, moonroof, and other trimmings.  The color was a light gray-blue/ivory with tan leather covering the interior.

After having the car for about a month now and driving it around constantly, you begin to notice some flaws on the GS300 and appreciate some of its finer qualities.

<b>The Exterior</b>

My GS300 has a grey-blue/ivory paint job that I absolutely fell in love with.  The car has a definite look to it that I really liked... although the space for the trunk seemed fairly small.  This is the design of the GS Sedans since 1998 (that's what the salesman told me).  The lines and curves of the car are very clean.  Panels seemed to be well fitting and panel gaps were of consistent distance throughout the car.  You have to take your hats of to Lexus for the craftsmanship that goes into the car.

The overall shape of the car seems to give it a going forward appearance... at least it does to me.

<b>The Interior</b>

The supple leather seats are pure heaven!  They give a pampering feel especially with the heated seats.  The color of the leather was a nice light tan/beige color with a matching interior and dash.  The dashboard panels light up in an eerie white color but make the dash very easy to read in about all conditions.  The wood paneling on the doors and dash are nice but seem to be of lesser quality than other parts of the car (even though I know the wood used is of high quality)... that disturbed me a little bit.  Almost all the controls were in easy reach and I especially had fun with the e-shift manual driving mode.

Temperature control worked well and maintained various temperatures fairly well.  Setting the dual temperature contol for the driver and passenger sides to the limit of cooling and heating, I found the the temperature of each side of the car had for the most part close to its desired temperature.  The climate control also achieved the desired temperature within a minute or two of being started.

The sound system is a Mark Levinson system that sounded good but not great.  The six CD-changer is located in the glove box within easy reach.  I found that several of my friends who imported the cars from Japan had Nakamichi stock sound system which really blew away the Levinson system in my Lexus.  (sigh)  The sound control panel is rather plain as well... and it reminded me of my 1995 Ford Explorer radio.

The middle storage compartment had two parts to it.  The only reason I mention this is that the bottom compartment has a power adapter in it.  You can plug your cell phone for charging and have it out of the way yet easily accessable.

The included garage door opener is also very nice and worked well with my top of the line Sear Craftsman garage door opener.

The trunk although having 14.8 cubic feet of space does not hold much at all.  The dimensions of the trunk are the cause of this problem.  Even the LS430 had a similar problem.

<b>Performance</b>

The car overall performs well but it is by no means a performance demon.  The GS300 has a V-6 engine that pumps out about 220 horsepower.  The dealer kept pointing out that the car did not have an in-line 6 engine like the ES300 or RX300, but that the GS300 engine is tuned for greater pickup and torque.  Even so... don't expect to beat out cars like a BMW i540 in the acceleration department.  Even with the ECT Power mode on (allows engine to push more rpms before upshifting gears) performance doesn't improve by a great deal.  By the way, ECT Power mode is a standard feature on most Toyota and Lexus vehicles.

Handling of the standard GS300 isn't as tight as I would like out of a sports sedan.  However, you can purchase additional replacement parts to improve this... if you so desire.  Lexus can install the parts as well.  However, the price to do this increases the total price significantly.  I didn't buy this car to do ridiculous speed racing, so the handling is okay with me for now.  Note that while handling isn't that tight, the ride is extremely smooth and refined.  You barely feel minor and medium bumps on the road.  Wind noise is nil at speed limits but appear at higher speeds 80-85 mph seems to be where I notice a faint whistling noise.  The LS430 did not have this problem.  Note that the GS300/400 cars have rack-and-pinion steering as opposed to power steering.  I preferred this configuration on a sporty car... I really think it makes a difference in the fun level of driving the car.

Visibility from inside the car was very good and I didn't notice any severe blind spots.

The weakest point of the car was that the V-6 engine allowed an average of 18 mpg in city driving and 21 mpg on highway driving.  A half tank of gas netted me only 120 miles...  so the milage will really put a dent in your wallet.

<b>Dealership</b>

As with most luxury dealerships, the salepeople and staff are extreme friendly and courteous.  I was quickly greeted at the Difeo Lexus in NJ and told that when I was ready, they would call up a salesperson to meet with us.  My family and I walked around viewing the various Lexus models on display until we decided which ones we settled as to likely purchase.  We asked for a saleperson and quickly one came up and quickly greeted us and went into details about the differences in models we were looking at.  He asked if we liked to test drive any of the cars and quickly brought up a 2002 GS300 to test drive.  He directed us to the Lexus warehouse to look at the various exteriors and interiors of the Lexus cars.  When it came to close the deal, he was never pushy and tried to meet our needs.

The only problem I noted was that servicing the Lexus was going to costly as per the maintenance schedule... however, the staff performed superbly and were always friendly and courteous.

This was the best dealing I've had with any car dealership in my entire life!

<b>Overall</b>

I enjoy driving around my GS300 and have no regrets about purchasing the car.  It is a great combination of luxury, performance, looks, and comfort with only minor quibbles.  I think it's a good car to pamper yourself with.  However, if you're looking for the high performance sports car primarily, you might want to look elsewhere.  I still prefer my Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 6 Tommi Maiken Edition with upgrades for pure performance driving :)
