            My husband bought his 1996 model in Sept. 1995.  In four years we've put 102,000 miles on the car.  We get the oil changed every 3,000 miles and have not been good about getting tune-ups (oops).  We've only had two tune-ups since he's had the car.  Each tune-up cost about $250--standard costs plus little things, like spark plugs, etc.

The gas mileage is incredible.  11 gallons takes us at least 400 miles--sometimes more, depending on highway driving.  The battery is the original battery.  The car drives easily, and we still have the original clutch.

If you have small children in car seats, though, there is a minor inconvenience.  The backseat slopes in, so if you have a child in a rear-facing carseat, they are often tipped forward in a very uncomfortable manner.  You can compensate for this by rolling a towel and placing it under the carseat (this advice is included in the carseat manufacturer's brochure).  <br><br>
