            Just got my Suzuki Grand Vitara 3 weeks ago, it's a scream.
Have almost rolled 600km (I'm in Canada EH!) and so far,
everything is EH!-OK.

Have to admit that the wife and I did a fair amount of
research prior to buying since these babies go for $25K +
up here in the Great White North,
 (Our 2000 JLX+ GV came in at just under $27K),
but our first and final choice was the GV, and we are pleased
with our decision.

Machine is a real head turner in our neibourhood that's
proliferated with RAV4's, HONDA CRV's, a few Tribute's
and ISUZU's.

GAS mileage is about 20mpg on the highway and around 
18mpg in the city, not the best.
 (We were told to expect this since it's new, and that
  it would gradually increase as we added the additional km's).

This is the 6th vehicle I've owned, the first one purchased
'NEW' and a departure for me, my 5 previous vehicles were all
Chrysler products,
 (66 Dodge Polara, 72 Plymouth Satellite Sebring +, 
  76 Chrysler Cordoba, 83 Chrysler Imperial,
  89 Chrysler Dynasty)
 (Interesting to note that each vehicle owned required
  more maintenance, more frequently, more expensive to repair,
  less reliable and generally more headaches as you progress 
  from the 66 Dodge to the 89 Chrysler).
 (Started driving when I was 19 and am now 48).
I plan on fixing 2 items that bother me, the AM/FM/CD player
has NO bottom end, a good set of speakers should do the trick,
and 2, the factory installed tires, 'Bridgestone Duelers',
will be replaced, so I can sleep better at night,
 (Enough said about that).
Other than that, everythings fine.
 (Had the infamous 'Rotten Egg' odor problem that was
  resolved by switching to a different Gas brand with a 
  lower sulphur content)

NOTE to potential buyer's,
get the dealer to throw in an owners manual, and READ IT.
Overseas designers/engineers have funny ideas about where
certain switches and knobs belong, took me a week to figure
out how to have the interior lights come on,
when you open the drivers door. 
If your in the market for an SUV, have a long close look at
the SUZUKI GRAND VITARA, then buy it.
Both my wife and I highly recommend the GV,
she says GV stands for Great Vehicle,
and she's never wrong.
