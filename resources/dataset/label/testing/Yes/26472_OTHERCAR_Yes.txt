My husband and I purchased a <b>1991 Plymouth Grand Voyager'</b> because of the size of our family. Two (positive size) adults with four children need <b>A LOT</b> of room. And in this used model of a <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager'</b> there is more than enough room for all of us, plus two friends to tag along. But room is not an issue here, not this time.

We bought our Plymouth Grand Voyager at an incredible steal. Only problem is, since then, we have had four safety recalls. One is pertaining to the bolts holding the carriage underneath the van. The notice stated it could endanger anyone who will be working under it. Another was the seat belts saying they could fail in an accident. Another is concerning the anti-lock brakes. And the one that bothered me the most is the one telling me how our steering wheel could crack and come off while driving! 

Of course there are no charges to the owner for having these items repaired, but I would like to have known in advance before buying the van what, if any recalls had been made and if they have been repaired. I was also informed by a mechanic AFTER purchasing the vehicle that Plymouth Voyagers are known for their cracked heads from over heating.

We have never experienced this problem. We have however experienced problems with windshield wipers quitting, bushings (?) in the doors going bad which causes the sliding door to come in contact with the front passenger door. Also, the radiator has broken loose from the frame under the hood and the anti-lock brakes have begun to malfunction. (Other than what the recall covers)

Since purchasing the vehicle two years ago, it has had a total of seven safety recalls, including problems with the back door and frame mounts that (I believe) are used to secure something under the van. The recall stated it could seriously injure someone working under the vehicle, so assumption is fairly close.


Although it may seem I speak badly about the <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager</b>, I happen to love my van. It's equipped with power windows, including P/W in the back, power locks, power mirrors, A/C, ample room for all of us and then some, smooth riding, the instrument panel is easily seen and everything you need is easily found less than an arms length away.

My advice to any one planning on buying a used vehicle (from an individual or a dealer) is to see proof of all repairs made to it, find out if it is possible to contact any previous owner, and ask if they have received any recall notices. Check around also about the recalls. Sometimes people just don't get their mail! You can even call the dealer of that model and have them check for any new recalls with an answer back to you in less than 5/10 minutes.

I'm certain most people are not in the market for this old of a vehicle, but if you are, then you know. And if you already own one but have never received any recalls, then you should get on the phone ASAP to a Plymouth dealer (that has a mechanic on hand) and have them search for the Recalls. You don't need the recalls on hand to have your vehicle repaired. Now days, they print what they need right off there computers.

ASAP folks. Failing anti-lock brakes in bad weather could cost you your life!
