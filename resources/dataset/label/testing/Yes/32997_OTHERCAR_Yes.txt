            Like many others who have reviewed this camera, I am a long-time shutterbug raised on Canon AE's & Pentax K's , ME's and the like.  Buying a digital camera has always been a desire but never practical for me because I, like other SLR shutterbugs, am a control freak when it comes to my camera!  I want to tell the camera how to take the picture, not the reverse (usually).  The problem for me has been image quality vs. functionality.  I want a high-res camera but I also want the controls offered at the higher price points.  What happened to the days when a manual camera was actually cheaper than the one with auto-everything?  Too bad we can't buy a K1000 range digital camera!  Hi res quality and 100% manual (light meter notwithstanding).  If I screw up a picture it had better be my fault!  

Digital SLR's are great for pros or perhaps for shutterbugs with too much money on their hands but I'm neither of these.  

The 7i bridges the gap.  It offers high resolution (4.92 million pixels & 5.24 million sensor photo detectors) up to 2560 x 1920 and goes as low as 640 x 480 for those low-res , low memory shots.  It is almost fully manual if you want it to be.  I say almost because there are settings like "bulb" that don't quite work like the traditional SLR.    

Love the continuous drive.  Very quick!  This feature makes it tough to miss that "perfect shot".  I just set it to continuous and start shooting.  Its the "scattergun" method of photography! The flash doesn't keep up but that's not unusual for any camera.  The flash leaves a bit to be desired if you're used to the high power units available on your SLR but you can add a more capable unit on the hot-shoe.  

It feels great in your hands.  The 7i feels very similar to your old SLR only smaller and lighter.

Its auto modes are user friendly and take very nice photos.  If, however, you're buying this camera to use it in auto mode most of the time, there might be better options available to you at a lower price.  That's not to say auto mode is lacking on this model, its simply that if you don't need the added functionality, why would you pay for it?

I simply love this camera.  Yes, I have taken hundreds of bad shots.  I've also taken hundreds more great shots that I must say do look very professional.  After a friends wedding, we compared processed shots from my 7i to the shots provided by the pro and they were virtually identical in quality.  

Point to consider --  Read the manual 2 or 3 times.  If you're new to digital photography (or photography in general) buy a book.  Take your camera with you on drives or walks and shoot everything and anything moving or stationary.  Experience is the best teacher. Try all the modes and settings to figure out how everything works.  After you learn the 7i, you'll love it.
