            When I had to return my corporate car from my last job, I had to replace it with something.. but I am a self-confessed car nut, and didn't just want a functional car.  I wanted a car that was practical, but fun, safe (I have a new baby), roomy, and handled well in the NY winters.  When I looked for all of this, the G20 fit the bill perfectly.

The car handles like a sports car, has tons of room, 4 doors, great mileage, handles very well, and all for a very reasonable price.  I leased mine, because mostly it is used for me to commute to the train station.  

I strongly recommend the t (touring) package, the front and rear spoilers are a nice touch, and the moonroof is a big plus.  I got the stick, which is great!  5 speed, smooth clutch, great acceleration through the gears and RPMs.

The car is a great buy for the money, and I'd get another one in a minute.  It has not had a single hiccup in the 7K miles since I got mine.<br><br>
