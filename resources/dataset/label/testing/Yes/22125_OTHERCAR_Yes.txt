            The DC215 is certainly a good bang for the bucks.  The immediacy of taking pictures and printing them instantly is too tempting. Go ahead, indulge yourself.   Now, it does help to invest in a compact flash reader so you don't have to hassle plugging your camera into your computer every time, but it's so well worth it.  Also, get it over with and buy a much larger memory card (it's like digital film).  Then suddenly, you have yourself a valuable tool to take anywhere.  This camera is a snap to use, too.  Basically, it's versatility and simplicity make it a powerful tool for both professional and pleasure use. It is small and very light.  Go ahead, do it.   <br><br>
