            I special ordered my Club Cab in September and have loved everything about it since I picked it up. The 4.7L sounds great and has loads of power, the low end torque is a real entertainer. I chose this truck because it is the only non-full size truck available with a V8 and a 5spd. I really wish it came with a 3rd door for rear cab access, a major drawback. The 3.92 rear gears and Limited Slip differential are highly recommended. The V8 gets about 20mpg at 70MPH but only 15mpg at 85MPH. The power this engine generates more than makes up for this. Great midrange acceleration and decent top end for a truck. I would stay away from Dark colors, the paint is very thin and picks up scratches quickly. Silver is what I should have ordered, the Black is very hard to maintain. The 7 Yr/100,000 Mile warranty and 0% Interest was the main reason I purchased so early in the year. I also got a good deal at invoice, about 2000 off retail. Very good ground clearance for a 2WD truck. With the tire and handling package, standard on the SLT, the truck handles well. Not too much body roll with the rear sway bar. I plan on modifying this truck extensively and a suspension drop is a readily available customization. I would recommend this truck over all of the other brands available with less power for the same money. QwikKota - Houston, TX
