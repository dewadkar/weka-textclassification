            This is truly a great machine. My parents bought this sport utility vehicle about three months ago and it truly runs like a dream.  I have never been behind the wheel of something so big and comfortable.  Lincoln Navigators are the best sport utility vehicles out in the market.  

<b>What does it have?</b> 

*5.4L
*32 valves
*V8 with 260 horsepower
*4x4 Control Trac...that actually uses a computer to maintain better traction on off road situations.
*Speed Sensitive Volume...it adjusts volume automatically depending on how fast you are moving and the wind speed...this is cool!
*leather seating...which seats 7 or 8 comfortably, and 9 at the very most.
*we have a television with surround sound(not included).
*adjustable foot pedals
*automatic car start...start your car from inside on a cold day.

<b>Why you might not want to get an SUV?</b>

*Well with the recent increases in gas prices, this should favor heavily on your decision to buy this car.  I believe this car takes Premium gasoline, which is more expensive.
*I'm not sure on miles to the gallon, but most SUV's don't get that many miles to the gallon.

If you are willing to pay the money and live in a luxurious SUV, then this car defiantly has a lot of positives.  It is very roomy and comfortable.  It's got 4 wheel drive which helps us, mainly because we live up in Wisconsin.  It's a very easy car to handle for it's size, too easy it almost seems.  If you are willing to spend a few more dollars and put in a TV, or a satelite monitor, I would, they are very cool.  Anyway this is a great car, it's a little spendy, but you are getting a tremendous vehicle in return.
