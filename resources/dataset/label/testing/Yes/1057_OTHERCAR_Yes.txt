            It all started over six years ago when my standard sedans (Pontiacs, Camarys, Audis) just didn't cut it any more.  But how do I find traveling comfort, reliability and all the accessories coupled with the demands of all weather travel and ordinary household and small business cartage?

The Jeep Grand Cherokee won out over all the other Utes I looked at, with price and features being the key factors.  Way back in 77 I had a standard Jeep soft-top and it was nothing but trouble, so I did have some reluctance in getting back into another Jeep.

The outstanding feature of the three I have had over the last six years is reliability, the very feature I had most fear about.  Other than routine oil and filter changes my Grand Cherokees haven't seen the repair shop at all.  I never thought anything could compare in service reliability to my Toyotas (have had 4 of them), but the Grands have been terrific.  On the first one, a 94 model, I actually tried to find something wrong to take it back during the warranty period, but no luck!

I found for smoothness of ride and luxury-type appointments, the Jeep compared nicely to my previous mid size sedans.  Yes, the Jeep is a bit higher with some sway, but over average roads and city streets the comfort is terrific and at the same time I can fill up the back with all those things my home repair and construction hobby require.

Subsequently, I tried leasing my Jeeps and found the financing arm of Jeep to be and excellent service with great pricing compared to other SUV leasing options, due mostly to the high resale values of the Grand Cherokees.  

As 2000 approaches, I think its time to look for another car and you can be sure my first visit will be to my Jeep dealer for the nicely rounded new body style Grand Cherokee.<br><br>
