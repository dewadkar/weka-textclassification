            The FujiFilm 3800 replaced my old 35mm camera I had been working with for years. With a 35mm I was always misplacing my exposed film, or forgetting to take it to get it developed, not to mention the prices for developing the film. With the 3800, all I have to do is plug the memory card into the reader (sold separately) or plug the camera directly into the front of the computer with the USB cable provided. And Wa-la! My pictures are ready to be printed, emailed, or deleted (for those shots that didn't come out so hot!) without having to pay for anything but the photo paper for my printer. And a package of photo paper is relatively cheap at WalMart, ranging from $5-7 dollars depending on brand name and finish.

As a person that is not very mechanically inclined, I was thrilled about how easy this camera is to use. It is basically point and shoot, and the 6x magnification is great for you are at the zoo and the animals are far away. On our trip to the zoo, I zoomed in on a crane that was at the far side of it's pen, and although I could barely see it in the viewfinder, I snapped it anyway, it came out great! You could actually recognize the crane on the finished shot!

The software that came with the camera is great too. It is a little confusing, but it does allow you to view your pictures as a slide show or copy them to a CD for a friend. No more bent pictures or lost negatives! the pictures are saved directly to your computer, where you can view and print them as many times as you need to.

There is also a video picture that lets you record for about a minute, which is actually longer than it sounds. It is perfect for recording your child blowing out the candles on their birthday cake, or your frisky kitten playing with a toy.

We got our camera at WalMart, and paid about $400.00 for it. The memory card reader and an extra memory card cost us about $100.00 more.

All in all this is a great camera - very easy to learn to operate.
