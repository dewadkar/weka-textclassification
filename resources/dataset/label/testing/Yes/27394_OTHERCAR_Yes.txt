                When the Neon was first introduced in late 1994 (as a 1995 model) it was unquestionably one of the most unique looking cars on the road. While price, power, and the overall fun factor of the Neon played a big role in its success, it was the Neon's evocative design work that made the '95 Neon a major consumer magnet. Although the '95 Neons no longer have the same head turning power that once made them so successful in 1994, they have aged very gracefully over the past 9 years; most case scenarios still being able to hang with the new automotive designs of today.

  For the '95 model year the Neon was available in 2 body styles; a 2 door coupe and a 4 door sedan. 2 engines were also available; a 132 horsepower 2.0 4-banger and a DOHC version of that engine boasting 18 additional horses. My '95 Dodge Neon Highline 4-Door Sedan came equipped with the SOHC 2.0 coupled with a slick 5-speed manual transmission.

<b>Driving Impressions:</b>

Curiously the 1995 Dodge Neon Sedan Highline feels a few shades faster than my 1998 Highline Coupe. During the 1996 model year they did make some changes with the engine, such as adding an air snorkel, a few PCM changes, etc. These changes hampered horsepower on a minute scale, however I did not think there would be a noticeable difference in <i>acceleration</i>; there is. The 1995 Neon coupled with a 5-speed manual is still no head snapper, though it does not hesitate whatsoever to get-up and go. A slight difference from post 1996 models is engine noise on take-off. The '95 models sound much louder/unrefined than the 1996-1999 models, the pay off here is slightly better acceleration. Surprisingly Dodge has done a very good job keeping the Neon almost torque steer free under full throttle take-offs. Unlike many relatively high powered 4-cylinder FWD cars, i.e the 2003 2.5 liter Nissan Sentra, the '95 Neon keeps in line no matter how hard you punch the throttle. The 5-speed is both smooth and quick to shift; throws are relatively short and there are no huge jumps between gears (besides from 4th to 5th) which enables the driver to get the most out of the Neon's SOHC 16 valve 2.0 .

The '95 Neons are without a doubt some of the most fun-to-drive economy cars offered from the '90s. The suspension is far from high tech and the tires less than sporty (195/65R 14s), though the Neon still feels solid on those demanding twisty roads. <i>Note:</i> Avoid the 13" wheels, there is a huge difference in handling between the 14s and the far less desirable 13s. I feel most owners will agree that the '95 Neon feels more like a sports car than a 4-door economy car when it comes to handling. The Neon's stiff suspension exhibits minimal signs of body lean/roll and provides the driver with confidence when tackling twisty roads at high speeds. Even those twisty roads loaded with pot holes or large bumps (that can sometimes toss a vehicle off track) hardly affects the Neon's competency in the handling department. In conjunction with good handling, the Neon boasts excellent braking. The Neon's braking system offers very good stopping power with very little fade. Even without the optional ABS, the standard front disc/rear drum brakes did an exceptional job stopping this 2,400lb mass.

The '95 Neon shows a little less refinement at <i>cruising</i> speeds than the post '95 model year Neons. Wind noise seems to be much more prominent in the '95 model than in my '98 coupe. Also, engine noise while cruising seems to be a few decibels higher than later model years. 

Similar to my '98 Dodge Neon Highline Coupe, the '95 Neon 4-Door Sedan is a bit sluggish on hills in 5th gear. The Neon seems to have an outrageously tall 5th (even though specs indicate otherwise). While tall gearing is great for fuel economy, quick passing maneuvers and hill climbing is a task that is rarely accomplished when the Neon is cruising in 5th gear. A quick down-shift into 4th remedies this problem, though I still would have liked to have seen the Neon with a slightly lower 5th gear. 

Fuel Economy is above average; averaging better EPA estimates than most economy cars with smaller gas engines for the '94-95 model years. Between 1994-1995 the EPA rated the Neon at 29/38 with the 5-speed manual. With the automatic transmission, the Neon's highway fuel economy dips to almost 30 MPG. 

<b>Interior/ Accommodation:</b>

The '95 Neon Highline's interior is not the greatest example of a well constructed cabin, but it does have its noteworthy assets. For example, ergonomics are excellent and the gadgetry used throughout the cabin is very user friendly; all controls are logically placed and the instrument cluster is easy on the eyes. The '95 4-door sedan offers good all around visibility. For reasons unknown to me, the '95 sedan seems to offer slightly better rear vision than my '98 coupe. My only major gripes with this interior would be the profuse amounts of cheap-o plastics used on the doors, top dash, and dash fascia. The optional center console is also far too small to be useful for stowage (makes a great arm rest though). 

Like the Base models, the Highline Sedan was only available with a few standard amenities. The difference between the Highline and Base trim level is that you were actually able to order options with the Highline. With the Base '95 trim levels many options could not be purchased even if you had the money to buy them. Standard equipment on the Highline includes dual front air bags, dual cup holders, an AM/FM radio (no cassette), power steering, and rear defrost.  Optional interior equipment on my '95 tester came AC, cruise control, Neon embroidered floor mats, power locks, tilt, a 4-speaker sound system with cassette, and a more comprehensive instrument cluster (including a tach). At the time, the options listed came with an additional price tag of nearly $3,000. 

Unlike the '95 Base Neon Sedan, the Highline Sedan boasts far more supportive/comfortable seating for long trips and aggressive driving. These seats are not exactly the variety you typically find in a sports sedan, however they offer a huge amount of comfort/support versus the standard seats. Another perk offered from the Highline Sedan is the rear seating. Instead of Base's rear seats that do not fold down whatsoever, the Highline's rear bench seats fold completely down increasing the amount of cargo space considerably.

 Head room is plentiful. Most drivers/passengers should have no problem in this department. On the other hand, leg room is a bit limited for drivers. Being 5'6" I am easily able to drive comfortably in this car without my knees hitting the bottom bolster of the steering column, although adults over 6' might have a problem here. The front seats do not move back as far as they should, so I would imagine most tall drivers will need to use the tilt steering feature just to be able to fit in the front seat. The Neon Sedan sits 5 people. While many complain that the back in too small for 3 full sized adults, for a subcompact car the Dodge Neon has one of the roomiest rear seating areas I have experienced.

<b>Price/Reliability:</b>

 When this car was new it had an MSRP of almost $14,000. The price on my '95 tester with 90,000 miles 5/16/03 was $1,900 from a private seller. This is a very low price for a Neon, usually a '95 Neon will run you between $2,000-$3,000. Reliability has not been so good for this particular Neon.. Unlike my '98 Dodge Neon Coupe, this sedan had to have quite a bit of work done to it over the 9 years/90,000 miles it has been on the road. The head gasket, clutch, catalytic converter, muffler, and struts all had to be replaced. 

<b>Final Thoughts:</b>

The '95 Dodge Neon Highline Sedan does have it's obvious downfalls, i.e.  some reliability issues, some interior quirks etc. Despite these downfalls, the '95 Neon offers good bang for your buck on the used car market. If you are looking for a used economy car with no sacrifice in the performance department I do recommend checking out a '95 Dodge Neon Sedan.
