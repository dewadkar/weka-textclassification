              We recently bought a 1990 Jeep Cherokee Laredo, and it is loaded. We have had many vehicles in the past, and even a truck. A BIG truck. Our Jeep is, by FAR, better than any car or truck I've ever owned. First off, it is quite large inside. I have 2 kids, and with cars, we always seemed cramped. We recently made a trip from Tucson to Louisiana, to Tennessee..with my husband and I, and 3 cats, and we STILL weren't crowded. Not only that, but I know that if God forbid, I'm ever in an accident, I won't be squished like those little sardine can cars some people drive. With 2 kids, safety is important.  

   You also get the best of both worlds with the Jeep. It feels like I'm riding in a big comfy car, and it's easy to maneuver. I also get the truck aspect of it, with the luggage rack, tow package, and interior space in back for hauling things. If I have a large load, I can also flip the backseat down and make more room.

   Yes, it's big, but it's also very easy to handle. We have the luxury of power steering, so this sucker can turn on a dime if need be. It's high enough to where I don't feel every little bump in the road, either (like in the Geo Storm we used to have).  It isn't really GREAT on gas mileage, but it isn't really bad, either. Just about average, I'd say.  

All in all, the Jeep has definitely spoiled me on all other vehicles. I may get a new SUV one day, but you can bet that it will be another Jeep!<br><br>
