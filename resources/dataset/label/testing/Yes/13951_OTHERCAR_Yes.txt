              I bought my second Metro this summer.  Its gas mileage makes up for its lack of features.  The first Metro was a 2 door hatch back I used for college.  I drove it for 8 years.  The engine lasts as long as you perform routine maintenance. I drove it over 130,000 miles and it is still going.  However, the body panels and buttons on the older models were not made to last.  
  I found a 1998 LSI model with improvements on the buttons and features.  This one is a 4 door with a trunk.  There is much more room in this one.  The plastic buttons that disappointed me are no longer there.  They have been replaced by metal knobs.  
  The Metro is a cheap, economical car that takes little maintenance.  Even the tires are cheap.  I average $100.00 for all 4 tires when it is time to replace them.
  The downside to this car is that its body doesn't take collisions and dings very well.  The metal is thin and bends easily.  It wasn't really made to last as far as the body goes.  But, it runs forever and is very dependable.  Just be cautious and don't get hit by anything.<br><br>
