            My dad bought an '84 Bonneville brand new back in 1983.  He still has this car today and it is almost in mint condition. He has taken very good care of it compared to the other similiar cars seen driving on the road.

This car was built with a strong body that has been fairly easy to maintain, and with great durability.  This car has well over 200,000 kms on it and it is still running great (for a car of this age).  Of course, like any old car, it has its problems, but that is to be expected.  

The seats are really comfortable, and this car has a lot of trunk space.  It is actually a comfortable car for a family trip (max 4 people), although the car does seat six, it is not recommended for travelling.  It has a lot of features, such as cruise control, power windows, locks, trunk, tilt steering, a good heating and A/C system.

The brakes seem to take longer to stop then most cars, but they always work, and have little problems over ice and snow.  The steering seems to be "loose" compared to newer cars that have fairly "stiff" steering.
