            I have been doing 35mm Photography for almost 20 years, and though I am a novice at digital photography, this one is easy to use, and produces great results!

I used a friend's camera at one point, and now find myself wishing that I had one handy for spur-of-the-moment candid shots and also for taking pictures of products that I sell.  No more worrying about the correct film speed, or paying and waiting for the film to be developed!

This is a great gift for parents, or teenagers who love taking pictures and having the results back quickly!  Unlike a Polaroid, these pictures are easy to reproduce and distribute, either on a website or attached to an email.

An easy transition to the age of digital photography at a reasonable price!<br><br>
