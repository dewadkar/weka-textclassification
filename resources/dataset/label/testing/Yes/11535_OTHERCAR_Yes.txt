            I own a 99' Sport 4x4 4.0 Liter 5 Speed with &quot;Up Country&quot; Option

I do a lot of hiking, camping, and skiing so I wanted a capable 4X4 big
enough to carry me and a few friends. But I didn't want a luxury bloatmobile, and I didn't want to pay more than a small fortune. I found most of the smaller SUVs lacked low range or clearance unlike the Cherokee.

So far my Jeep fits the bill nicely. On road it has great acceleration, is highly maneuverable, and for an SUV reasonably economical (I get 19-20 MPG). I do notice a little rear end hopping around certain corners - I think the Trac-Loc differential (part of the Up Country Option) might be responsible. There is also some drive line vibration at about 2200 RPM.

Off road it seems admirably competent - steering is crisp in the rock gardens and it climbs steep hills with amazingly little effort. The engine tolerates a wide range of RPMs without complaint, and you can easily &quot;idle&quot; over rocks. On or Off road backing is easy because of the excellent visibility.

Control layout is excellent - everything is clear and in sight

I find the front seat plenty comfortable and roomy (I'm 5'9'') My slightly taller Girlfriend finds it just slightly cramped. The back seat is fairly cramped but it's still possible to carry three adults (if they are good friends). I have carried 5 adults (including) and all gear for an cross 
country skiing day trip - I do have a ski rack, and three adults for a
backpacking trip with all gear and nothing on the roof.

Initial defects were minor (A broken speaker and lighting control module) and I've had nothing else fail so far (10K miles).

I don't like the spare tire location - it's inside the passenger compartment where it takes up space and affects visibility. I also think, like most SUVs these days, the bumpers are inadequate for off roading - I don't think they'd stand up to jacking.
