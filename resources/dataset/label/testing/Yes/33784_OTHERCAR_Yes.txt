            COnsidering my bitterness over the fact that my dad didn't buy me an Acura GS-R, I would say that he made a good decision, with the help of luck, to get a GEO PRIZM Hatchback.  I was still reeling over that fact that he didn't get me my dream car, even if I was going to pay for everything...ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO SIGN THE LOAN!!!!

Anyways, he bought a Geo.  I was so scared that it was a metro, but then again, i was sort of relieved that it was a Prizm, which has a Toyota Corolla body.  Cosmetically, I was quite pleased with the overall apeal of the car.  It sort of looked like a 1990-1993 Integra due to its hatchbacked nature.  

My primary argument with my dad not getting me a 95 or up car is that if the car breaks down on me, i wont have any way to get it started again.  I was so relieved to find out that geo cars CAN LAST.  I knew for the fact that Geos were American cars, meaning, they have the tendency to be unreliable.  I was surprised to find out that my Prizm had a Toyota engine!  No wonder they're so reliable!  That made me happy!  I test drove the car, and after driving a 1991 civic for months, there were some noticeable differences.  
First, i tend to floor the gas pedal, not to the point that it will accelerate quickly, just enough to see if the car can hang.  The car accelerated superbly, as there wasn't a certain feeling of inadequacy.  WOW!  My dad's Civic accelerated like it was towing something and usually has a back kick on the transmission..meaning you can almost feel the auto transmission shifting and causing a sudden lapse in power.  The geo, though mine i would suspect carries 102 HP, accelerated wonderfully and smoothly without any loud noises!!!

The handling is superb.  My Geo feels light and is very responsive to my every moves.  The handling feels like a honda and much like any sub-compact car.  The only problems that i see is when drivers, who were used to driving big cars or trucks, trying to adjust to the sudden burst of lightness the car carries.     

Inside though was a different story.  The seatbealts were kind of annoying especially if you're so used to automatic seatbelts.  The instrument panel was uninspired, but clear and direct to the point.  But I accept those facts simply because this is a 10 year old car and i understand that its an economy car.  The setas were comfy enough, no problems there..And theres ample room for everybody even at the back.  Of course, if you're taller than 6'2, i suggest not getting any sub-compact cars or sport cars, especially if you're not the driver...The AC is cool enough, thank goodness because it's already warming up!  The sounds are okay at the most, not too impressive but typically okay.  

Overall, this is an excellent car to own!  I trust that this will last because of its Toyota powerplant!  An excellent, modest, and perfect car for the 1st time drivers!
