            The Chevrolet Venture is a family pleasing minivan.  Opt for the Warner Bros. edition and the definition of a quiet ride takes on a whole new meaning with three kids in the rear.  It is a pleasure on even short drives around town.  The Venture gives you plenty of options to keep everyone happy.  The OnStar system is a nice included option but the cost to renew when the initial year is over seems somewhat pricey for a service that most folks with AAA will not need.  

There are plenty of new safety enhancements with the 2001 model.  The available rear parking aid is an option you just cannot live without in a vehicle of this size.  It gives you an audio and visual way of detecting what is near your rear bumper.  

The downside of the Venture is the extremely weak power that cries from the front.  This engine sounds harsh and really is as it strains to carry this vehicle.  The vehicle I drive has the trailering package.  GM says it can haul up to 3000 lbs.  I am not convinced it will have the power to handle that much of a load.  The poor quality inside was evident in my first week with the van.  the first time the driver side door was slammed shut it knocked the very low grade plastic off the dash and displaced a small cup in the dash.  It was replaced under the warranty.  

Overall, for the money this van is worth looking at.  When compared to others out there, the quality does not stack up with the Honda Oddysey.  Whether you choose the Chevy/Pontiac/Olds version of this van, you do get a lot of van for the money.
