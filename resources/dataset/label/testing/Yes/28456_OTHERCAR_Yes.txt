            I was looking for a car to upgrade from a Nissan Maxima, more room, more luxury, better ride, stereo etc.  I checked out several including the new Lincoln LS the Lexus ES300 and BMW 5 series.  I chose the Avalon for what you get for the price. Not only is it roomier than the other two, it rides as well and feels as luxurious. 

The styling isn't breathtaking but it is a handsome car.  Everyone who rides with me is astonished at how polished, roomy and comfortable the car is.  It doesn't have the fancy nameplate or perhaps the prestige of the other cars but it sure has more room, the same ride and luxury.  From my point of view, why spend more money on a car where the rear passengers will be cramped.

This leads me to the real reason to buy this car.  ROOM.  You can put three adult men in the rear and they will be comfortable.

Driving is a dream.  Not a German driving machine by any means but it is responsive and more than adequate.  <br><br>
