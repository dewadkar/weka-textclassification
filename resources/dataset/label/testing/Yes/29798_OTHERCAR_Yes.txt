            The Kodak DC-260 takes wonderful photos when set to its highest quality settings.  The high resolution makes a vast difference compared with the digital cameras of just a few years ago.

However, given this, there are a few problems I was not expecting which have dulled my joy at going digital.

1) Focus

The camera will sometimes mis-focus to a large degree giving a very fuzzy image.  Unfortunately, the LCD panel on the back is too small for the mis-focus to be noticed.  If it were noticeable at this stage, it would not be as big a problem.  However, I find that I only notice this when I'm back home viewing the photos I've shot that day.

2) Compression

For some images, such as sunsets and others with delicate tones and gradual blends, the compression is WAY too aggressive.  This is the case even on the highest quality setting.  With 64MB memory cards becoming more and more common, I would be happy to sacrifice 4MB per shot in order to get an uncompressed image.

3) Quality versus Film

I also have a professional-grade Nikon slide scanner and a comparison of photos shot with the digital camera and those taken with a 35mm SLR onto Kodachrome reveal how much farther the digital technology still has to go.  With traditional film scanning, I can capture an image many times larger and still many times sharper than those with the digital camera.

4) Bulk

The camera is quite small and light compared to a regular 35mm SLR.  However, since it can't make it as a substitute for a regular film camera, this is one of its few advantages.  Given this, if I had to make the purchase again I would focus less on image quality (no pun intended) and more on getting a camera that I could easily take anywhere.<br><br>
