            When the BMW M3 first came out in 1988, it was destined for perfection. With it's 2.3 liter 16 valve I-4, it pumped out 192 horsepower. It was more than muscle however. It's suspension system made it fly majesticly while cornering or what-not. So good is the M3's handling that it has been on the Car and Driver's best handling car for over $30,000 since it came out. Alas however, it went away for 3 years from 1992-1994. Upon it's return however, it returned with a brilliance unmatched by most things. It returned with a newly designed 3.0 liter V6 with 240 horsepower, and an even better suspension. The newer ones have a 3.2 liter Variable Timed DOHC engine.
It is a performance machine. The newest ones, which have not been released out here in the States yet, are a dream.. 3.4 liter V6, outputting 340 horsepower!!! That is a 100 horsepower to liter ratio! It is just amazing! The M3 is the perfect car.<br><br>
