            I researched digital cameras for a long time on dpreview.com and decided on the Sony for three reasons: 1. I'm partial to Sony, 2. I had bad experiences with the Nikon's, which were the runners up in my opinion, and 3. The lens system.

First, some comments on the design.  Yes, we have no viewfinder here but contrary to some opinions that it is hard to use the LCD screen in the sunlight, I find it very easy to see.  And, it is very easy to shoot from the hip or over the head.  The rotating back is fantastic.  To be honest, I don't miss a viewfinder.

The lens makes for fantastic pictures.  I do recommend that if you buy this camera, go ahead and budget for the following: an extra battery, a 64 meg Memory Stick, and a screw-on UV filter to protect the lens.  The 4 meg chip that comes with the camera is silly, but with the 64 meg, I can get up to 300 images and three or four one-minute videos.  I shoot at 1600X1200, medium JPEG resolution.

I also love the video + sound capabilities.  There's nothing cooler than being able to shoot high quality pics at an event, then switch to movie mode and capture the essence of the event.  These aren't high-quality movies, but the sound quality is wonderful.

There's a lack of manual mode control, but the built-in programs are excellent for 90% of my work.

Last thing: the Win2000 drivers are out, so no worries there.  I connect to my Win2000 machine w/o a hitch.<br><br>
