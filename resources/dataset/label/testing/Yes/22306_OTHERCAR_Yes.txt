            I love my Mazda MPV, and can say that I am honestly NOT embarrassed to be driving it around town! I can actually roll down the windows, (all four of them, incidentally) and blast Aerosmith on the high quality sound system AND retrieve my daughter's lost toy from the back seat at the same time!

This minivan is great. When my family and I went to look for a new car, we wanted something that was practical and still stylish. We have three small children, and so we were looking mainly at minivans, because we need the space. We had previously owned a Chevy Lumina, which, while functional in a space-savvy way, was pretty blase to look at. I felt like the housewife that I am, chauffeuring my family from one school event to another.  I was at the stage in my life where the dull green boat-like Chevy was just not doing it for me anymore. I wanted something more... something different. As the former driver of a fire-engine red sports car, I was ready, once again, for something cool. 

Enter the Mazda. We looked at almost every minivan out there, and just couldn't stand the way they looked. Sort of square, dull and all alike from the outside. (The one exception being the Honda Odyssey, which looks to me something like an extended station wagon.) We were initially drawn to the Mazda by its sleek design. It came in many different colors, and with lots of extras, untypical of a minivan. My favorite of these was the fog lights on the front of the vehicle. I use them at night all the time, rain or shine. This makes the Mazda look a little more like a car than a minivan, at least in my mind. Ditto the roof rack and the fold-over rear seat which flips back into a tailgating position. We actually used this the last time we went to a Met game. We simply flipped the seat over and sat with our legs dangling over the rear bumper of the car as we ate our lunch! How cool is that?!

The rear windows also roll down, as opposed to flipping out as most minivans do. 

The best part about this van is that it drives like a car. It's not clunky or cumbersome, but very easy to maneuver, and smooth. You sit a little lower than you would on a regular minivan and, therefore, it's easier to see the road ahead. 

The one drawback is that this car is a little smaller than some of the other minivans as far as trunk/storage space goes. But really the only time that would come into play is on a long vacation and if you have a particularly large family.The rear seats can be folded down to make space, but we have three children, so one of them is always sitting in the back, and the only real storage space beyond that is behind the rear seat to the rear door. But we plan on investing in a roof case to put on top of that cool roof rack we had to add!

Bottom line is that I love this car, it drives well, it has lots of great extras and IT IS COOL!!
