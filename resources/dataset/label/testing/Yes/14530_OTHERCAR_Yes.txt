            The accord is a car for the masses.  It dosen't offend, it's reliable, and it feels trusty.  Accords have always been that way.  But the coupe has a slightly different personality.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's still not a fun car, but it has a slightly more sporty/youthful image than the all too common sedan; the coupe really stands out from the accord crowd.

For a year my son owned a 1991 Accord Coupe LX, white with red interior and an automatic.  It was somewhat difficult to find a coupe, but one day while out cruising my son stumbled apon this one.  We bought it the next day.  

My immediate impressions were that this nicely cared for car was a great car for him.  It offered good power (for a 4 cylender), sipped gas, handled nicely, and was well equipped.  It even had an excellent aftermarket CD stereo!  The only thing that bothered me was that the car shook when started, even in hot, good weather.  In winter, the car danced, and often stalled just after being started.  It was probably just a small ignition problem.

Accords can be transformed from boring, everyday cars to road rockets with little money, but my son didnt try to hard to do that, he just wanted stylish everyday transportation.  A set of white 17 inch wheels on a white accord sure looks nice, and thats what he got.

Over the year he owned it, it worked well. It never broke down, averaged close to 30 miles per gallon with a mix of city and highway driving, and handled every road condition well, even snowy pennsylvania winters!
