            When I started working for my current employer I was given a 98 Astro cargo van for a Co. vehicle

At first I was worried about repairs and large blind spots but over the last six months and 10,000 miles I accually like driving this vehicle.

When I first got the van it had 14,000 miles and had been converted to passenger use with the addition of two rows of seats.  Being a Cargo van I do wish it had more features namely power door locks/windows and a more hospitable interior.  What I have found is the driver gets a rather good view of the road.  The large side view mirrors and large windows on all doors (including side)makes for easy driving and safe lane changes.  The only time I find blind spots a problem is when backing up in crowded parking lots.  I did find out that the height of my van with a after-market luggage rack is exactly 6'4.  Well this is according to the loud thunk sound as I drove under the parking garage height indicator bar.  Ops.

My van is came with the anti-lock brakes and dual front air bags.  The brakes work well and have kept me from evaluating the air-bag performance thankfully.  Being a large van handling is reasonably secure but will not compare with newer car based minivans.  Body lean and a bouncy suspension are the call of the day.  The highway ride is extremly smooth and stable though.  

I do have two minor complaints that could be easily fixed.  First when you first get into the van you think that Chevrolet put the front seats in backwards.  The adjustment for the seat back recline is located on the inside side of each seat as opposed to the out side of every other car I have driven.  Other wise the interior is well thought out and comfortable for the two front seat passengers.  The "cargo" area lacks in sound (or any other) insulation but is ready to haul whatever.  

My second complaint is that the front headlights are not very bright.  They don't seem to provide much light on dark roads.  The lights themselves often get covered by a thick film of dirt.  I guess this is due to the lights being recessed from the grill and surrounding body work but this design also prevents automatic car washes from cleaning them.

The van has required no repairs outside of oil changes and runs very smoothly.  The 4.3 engine seems well suited to this duty and I never want for more power no matter how many passengers or cargo I am carrying.
