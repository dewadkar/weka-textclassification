            We leased this vehicle because the family needed a car that could hold all of us comfortably and had room to haul luggage for trips.  This was the perfect car.  It is incredibly comfortable and very roomy.  We love it!  The whole family fits in it with skiis on top and luggage for a week's vacation.  There is so much room and it is unlike those other ugly minivans.  It is actually a nice looking car and is easy to get in and out of.  After the lease is up we're going to lease or maybe buy the same one.  It fits all of our needs and drives very well, especially in the winter.  I recomend this car for just about everyone!<br><br>
