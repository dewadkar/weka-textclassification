            I do not personally own an <b> Ford Expedition</b>, however my parents currently do. 

There is <b>TONS</b> of room in these vehicles.  There are two bench seats that would comfortably fit three adults in each one. 

There is a lot of cargo space as well, and plenty of room for driver and front passenger.

It comes equipped with both driver and passenger air bags.  The big draw back is that the passenger air bag <b>Can NOT</b> be turned off.

They come equipped with a V8 engine, that offers a lot of horsepower and is great for pulling boats, campers, or anything else.  

<b>Some of the draw backs in my opinion are the following:</b>

1.  I feel like they are a little too big and bulky.  

2.  Does not have the handling that I would expect from a SUV.  I feel like it is a little more <i>truck</i> feeling when driving and riding it it.

3.  They are big gas hogs.

<b>Some of the advantages are:</b>

1.  They have <i>very</i> comfortable seats.

2.  Lots of interior room

3.  You are probably safer in one if in an accident because of the size of the vehicle.

Some of the options that most of them come equipped with are, 6 disk cd player, air conditioning, all wheel drive, cruise control, back controls for heater and air conditioning.
