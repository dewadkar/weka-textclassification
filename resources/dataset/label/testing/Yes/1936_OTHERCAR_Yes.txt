            I have had my Maxima since March 1999.  It has been the best car I have driven in its class. I am happy with its handling and its ride all around.  It has the pick up I like and enough luxury to keep me going.  The truth is that in NY what a guy like me is looking for is a fast car at a good price that has a long lasting quality to it.  That is exactly what this car is.  I look around at these guys with there expensive cars and wonder why they choose to suffer with the burden of worrying where to park.  This is the best option for someone looking for that sporty and somewhat luxurious car, and who doesn't care about its looks.  I would not recommend this car for someone is trying to pick up some hotties on a Friday night.  It is for a person who knows how to appreciate a great car for its inside not for its cover.  
Of the bad things to note about the car I cannot hold back from saying that there is a small problem with the handling in the rain.  Secondly, remember to change your oil or you may not be happy with the start up after 3,000 miles.  Otherwise I haven't had any problems, its been a pleasure.<br><br>
