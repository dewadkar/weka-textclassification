            Last Fall we bought a SL2 Saturn. BOY, DO WE LOVE OUR CAR.  The main reason we bought it is that it gets GREAT GAS MILEAGE.  It gets 35 MILES to a gallon on the highway and at 26 MILES to a gallon in town.  Considering the price of gasoline these days,I'd say we made a great choice don't you think?!!! 

The second reason we bought this Saturn is the PRICE.  You can really get a lot of car for the money.  Not only are they priced reasonably, but they really HOLD THEIR VALUE too. This is like saving and making money at the same time.

Guess what!  the WARRANTY and SERVICE on this Saturn is fantastic.  Listen to this!!:THREE YEARS OR 100,000 MILES. 
When we take it in for an oil change they check everything out. Then they wash our car before they give it back to us.  Everyone is very COURTEOUS, KNOWLEDGEABLE AND HELPFUL. (They even have coffee and donuts for free while we wait!)

Our Saturn is a CLASSY LOOKING little car.  It is that new dark blue green four door. The top is retractable. On the trunk is a streamline spoiler. The interior is a nice beige leather. There is a center arm rest which opens up for extra storage. We have air, radio, tape deck, reclining seats with a lumbar,BONUS!!: BACK SEATS FOLD DOWN, so you can carry long objects from the trunk through into the car (just like having a truck bed almost), the steering wheel is adjustable, it has cruise control, automatic trunk and door locks and openers too. It's loaded!!! The wheels are special mags. We look and feel like were driving a sports car.

Last , but not least.  We can TOW our Saturn behind our R.V., even with the transmission being  an automatic. It' so nice, we hardly even know were towing it behind us. When we camp or just want to go sight seeing we can jump in our car, even take our friends too, and go off on any side trips we want to take. As I said before WE LOVE OUR SATURN.
