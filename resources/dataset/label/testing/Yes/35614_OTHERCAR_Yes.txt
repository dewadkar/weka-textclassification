            I purchased my '98 Malibu used in mid-'99 and have been in love with it ever since.  I was leasing a 1996 Geo Prizm at the time and was ready to get rid of it - an okay car, but I had a little more money this time around and was ready to take a step up.  We shopped around A LOT, looking at Accords, Camrys and Altimas as a comparison.  I loved the Accords and Altimas, but they're way too expensive for what you're getting.  You're basically going to pay as much for a bare model of them as you will for a loaded Malibu.  I hate Camrys - I think they're ugly and too middle-aged for me (I'm in my 20s).

I think this car is aimed at the 25-1000 year old driver.  That's the best part about it.  It has a V-6 with power everything (except seats) and is really a nice car.  It's comfortable, fairly roomy (not so much in the back) and is pretty quiet, even at high speeds (I drive 40 miles each way to work everyday on the highway).  It's decent in the snow - no fishtailing or anything, but the car's pretty light, so that's what you can expect.  The reason this car would appeal to such a large age range is that it is reasonably sized and pretty darn quick for a mid-range car.

I have never been in an accident in this car, so I cannot comment on passenger safety, but I do like the &quot;fasten seat belt&quot; light that blinks if the driver is not belted, and there's a little dinger that sounds if a door is even slightly open while the car is in gear.  The dome light that fades gradually after you turn your car off is also helpful.

I have not had any trouble with my Malibu - only into the shop for oil changes and tire rotation.  A couple of squeaks here and there, but I think that's a result of New England winters - frost heaves!

I bought this car planning that I would still have it when I have children.  I would feel perfectly safe with children in my car.<br><br>
