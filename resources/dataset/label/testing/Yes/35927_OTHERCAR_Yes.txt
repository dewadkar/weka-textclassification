            I have this 1989 Nissan Pulsar XE and purchased it new in June of 1989.  At the time it had less than 10 miles.  I had purchased the car to replace an aging Mazda.  As soon as I sat in the seat I feel in love with it.  Of course I was only 20 so the attraction to a car of that type was obvious.

Now much older I still have the car with 200,000 miles and still running great! I take great pride in the car and how I've maintained it.  I am so anal about it even have a program to track maintenance.

Car is a great car to drive on a fall day with the T tops off.  Its a wanna be sports car with fair handling and no pickup but that is what makes it fun. Besides how many cars like this to you know pass stuck 4x4 vechicals in a snow storm?  The front wheel drive is a big bonus.

The car has four seats, but it really has two with extra baggage capacity.  Feel sorry for thoose who have sat in the back.  Great econmical car for those interested.

If interested in my maintenance log, drop me an email.   I send to you.
