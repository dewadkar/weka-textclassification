            The GMC Yukon is spacious, having enough room for all of the passengers to be comfortable, while their luggage can still fit in the back.  The ride in this car is very smooth, and it even looks good, too.  So many packages and features are available on this SUV that you won't know what to pick.  I highly recommend the Yukon to everyone who loves SUVs or needs a bigger car -- especially parents who need to buy their children cars.  The Yukon has a safe, comfortable ride.  Since it is higher above the ground than a car, shorter people can see the road better and therefore be safer when driving.  I love the Yukon, and since I am short, I am at an advantage while driving this car.  Being in a larger car is actually safer when in an accident because a little car cannot total your SUV as easily.<br><br>
