            We own a 1994 Altima GXE. We bought it used when it was three years old and had 25000 miles. It now has 55,000 miles, and I am very satisfied. Of course, it's starting to show its age. 

I come from Europe, where cars are more like the japanese cars. We like cars that stick to the road, where you get a feeling of what's going on. And the Altima is great in that respect, while still being very comfortable. The power is adequate. A little bit more would not hurt, but it's ok. I love its manual transmission, and it helps getting the most out of the engine. 

My only complain would be about the brakes. Don't get me wrong, it probably brakes better than most cars, but it sometimes feel like the discs are warped, and this is very unpleasant. I just changed discs and pads, and it still does it. 

I have to say that I am still not convinced by the styling of its body. It is not ugly, but there are many cars on the market that looks much more attractive. And the current Altima looks even worse than the old one in my opinion. However, the inside looks much better than in most cars in its price range. 

I wanted an economical and reliable car, and my Altima proved to be a great choice. If I had wanted a dream car, I would have looked somewhere else.
