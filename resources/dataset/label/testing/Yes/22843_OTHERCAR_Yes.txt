            I am a college student, I needed a good used car for not too much $.  I got so much more than I expected in the Integra.  It is sporty, cute, fun to drive, and worth every penny!
I love how you can feel the road in this car!  Driving on windy roads has become one of my favorite things to do since I've had my little Integra.  Mine is a 91 LS automatic with 113K miles (when I bought it).  Even though others may tell you get the 5 speed, don't fret if you are like me and can't drive a 5-speed!  I love the automatic.  It has a great transmission and it changes gears very quickly.  It is a smooth ride, and much speedier than I thought it would be.
I dont hate anything about this car.  It is my first car and I think it is just perfect for a first car.  I wish that I could tell you the downside to it, so you would have a more balanced opinion to read here, but really... there is nothing bad I can say.  It is perfect for me.  I have not had to do any work on it (besides an oil change), it is an easy car to maintain, easy (and fun) to drive, and it will last you forever.<br><br>
