            In August of 1997 my parents bought me a 1990 Dodge Spirit. When I first looked at it I wasn't very impressed. The body style and lack of &quot;Sportyness&quot; wasn't to pleasing to a 19 year old college student. However after a while the car grew on me. I found it more then reliable. I drove back and forth to Charleston numerous times without having any problems. The car was reliable and drove well. I found that as long as I treated it will by keeping the oil changed and basic maintenance, the car would treat me good as well. 
  However, the most important reason I would recommend the dodge Spirit is because of a car accident that I was involved in. I was coming back from Charleston going up 17 North. A man in a Buick pulled out in front of me and I hit him on the side of his car at a slight angle...GOING 70MPH!! That alone should tell you something. I'm here to tell you about the accident. Although my car was totaled, the car had minimal damage to the Engine, and I..although in pain from the accident...walked away...alive. As far as I'm concerned. That's the best reason to buy a car. Safety! I would recommend this car for people who are on a limited budget and can not afford to be paying for repairs constantly, or for parents who are buying a car for their son or daughter.   
    Oh, one more thing. The car had over 200,000 miles on it and was still running great until the accident.  <br><br>
