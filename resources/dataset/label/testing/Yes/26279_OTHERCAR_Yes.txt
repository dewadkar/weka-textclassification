            I test drove this Honda to check it out.I wanted to see what the car handled like.I chose a dealer from Calgary Alberta. The price range quote was $18K to $23K Canadian. ( My wife never pays the quote ). The car was a demonstrator and I drove it for 1 day.

It was roomy and drove very well, I liked it's pick up on the peddle. I filled it once and it had fuel left from the fill up when I returned it with 734 kilometers on the trip odometer. I liked the visual arrangement of the dash and controls. 
 The color choices are OK, not spectacular, but this is a matter of taste.
I think the basic, no frills model is the best price for what you get. The price rises too much for extras.  In honesty though the no frills package is very useful and there are features on the basic package that are options on some cars.( mats, trim, radio and trip odometer )

Dealers like to give you the price of the top extra package first.I checked out the maintenance sheets and talked to a mechanic and a couple of customers waiting for their cars. The car stands up well , especially if you keep up the maintenance package.The customers were all happy with their cars( I might have got them on a good day)
I think a new family with 2 children is perfect for this car. I have not decided on buying any car yet. I am looking to see who comes out with the fuel cell electric.( at a reasonable price in this car range)<br><br>
