            I purchased my TDI Jetta Wagon in Oct 2001 and patiently waited four months for its delivery.  I got the GLS with leather and Auto transmission.  The car is rock solid, handles great and has had only two small issues in 18,000 of driving: 1. The lens of the instrument cluster cracked the first week (replaced under warranty) and 2. One speaker had a short (replace under warranty).

I have had one major complaint and that is with the transmission.  It seems to hunt rather than definitely pick a gear and it yield less than stealer fuel economy.  Everyone writes about getting 50 mpg or better with the 5-spd, but I have never achieved better than 38 mpg and usually I average about 31 mpg.  Even so, the car and engine act superbly.  Then engine is very strong and provides adequate acceleration and excellent cruising power.  It accelerates from 60-80 very well and easily cruises at 80+ mph.  Engine noise is only a factor during warm-up, especially in cold weather when the engine might take 5+ miles to get to temperature.  After its warm, it is only slightly noisier than any other car.

If rear seat room is an issue, the wagon back seat is much more comfortable than the sedan.  We use a Thule box on top and drive 200 miles one-way with four adults, two dogs and all the luggage on top &#150 everyone&#146s happy.

Good luck.
