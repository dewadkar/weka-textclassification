            Ok...a lot of people like to drive the sporty expensive cars.
I don't know why.  I paid about 13,8. And I got a great car with a lot with it.  I have the Power windows, doors, A/C Stereo, spoiler, alloy wheels and some other options.  This is a great car.  

Very smooth ride.  I cannot explain how it feels to drive it.  Some cars give a a bumpy ride when you are riding because of the shocks and what not, but not this car.  The ride is smooth and you can actually enjoy driving this.  

One highlight about this car is that even though it isn't the fastest car, or have the highest horsepower, it is still a fairly quick vehicle.  I mean for a 1997 Nissan Altima, it's stock engine is a 150hp, 16 valve engine.  But when you drive it, and step on the gas...man does that thing go.  The quickness for a luxury sedan is great.

The comfyness of the ride and the roomy interior is great also.  There is so much leg and headroom to just flow around the place.  The seats are nice and comfortable and the furnishings inside the car give you a nice luxuric feeling when you are driving.

One thing that I can say that is not the best is the gas mileage.  Can't just say the good and leave out the bad.  The gas mileage isn't the best, but that is of course when you like to hit the gas every so often.  Which I know a lot of people have the urge to do.  Having the power at your feet is a great feeling.  I can fill up, about 10 gallons of gas, and get a good 200 miles, which isn't so bad, but it all depends on how you drive it.

To conclude, this is infact a great car and I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a little luxury while having fun when they are driving.  I am a very satisfied customer.
