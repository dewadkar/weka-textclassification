            I just bought a sleek black, sexy 325is with 61000 miles on it.  From what I understand, that's just getting started for a BMW.  I have never owned a vehicle like it.  It's by far the most responsive car I have had the pleasure of controlling.  It never seems to run out of power, the shifting is flawless and it handles as well as, if not better than any of the newer German cars I test drove.  Cold starts on cold morning are instantaneous and strong, and cold engine idle is barely noticeable.  Of course, once things warm up, the engine idles silently.

I would be remiss if I failed to mention that the comfort level inside this mid-sized is phenomenal.  I have never felt more cradled or secure in a car's seats than I do in these.  They lend themselves to enhanced control and I feel very spoiled in them.  While on the subject of the interior, it's worth noting that the instrumentation is arranged conveniently and intuitively.  Everything is well within reach, and I love the orange glow of the gauges at night.

When I am behind the wheel, I feel satisfaction knowing that I am now part of a long, proud heritage of excellent engineering.  My months of research before buying revealed an unshakable truth - the pros love BMW's.  It was not until I drove this 325is that I finally realized why.

For me this tradition is the REAL BMW APPEAL, not the image, and not the status.  In fact, having only owned if for four days upon writing this, I am still somewhat uncomfortable telling people I have a BMW, because I always had a preconception about such people.  Now I realize that many of them were just smart, sophisticated consumers.

I plan to keep this car in the family for a very long time, and when finances allow for a brand new car, I will look no further than my neighborhood BMW dealer, because I am hopelessly hooked.  In fact, my love of this car is causing me constant day dreams during which I'm useless at the office.<br><br>
