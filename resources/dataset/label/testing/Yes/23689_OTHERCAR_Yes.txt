            PT01a
I just bought a PT Cruiser (Shaver Chrysler - Jeep in San Bernardino). This is going to be a long-term reliability test.
To start off, I was surprised at the control that Chrysler has over the configurations which are available. This means, for instance, that I didn't want air conditioning (because that is what I want). However, the base (Classic) PT Cruiser comes with AC as standard. Then, I said I sure don't want that rear window windshield wiper, but that was explained to be standard also. The rear window defogger is standard. I didn't want a CD player because I wanted to put my own in, but a 6-speaker CD is standard also (and sounds really nice). Power steering, power brakes, and power windows are standard on the base PT. My only complaint was that the steering wheel was too high, but after driving it a few days, I noticed a lever down there, and discovered that it has an adjustable steering column (standard). It has Goodyear Eagle tires. What I'm trying to say is that the base PT has a lot of options, and is really great, so I will enjoy this reliability test. Probably the most important things about reliability (I am  a reliability engineer) is that often, the designers may worry about how the vehicle runs, but ignore the driver. In this case, it appears that the driver has number-one priority. That is why people buy a vehicle in the first place (because it feels good).
I initially sort-of wanted a PT Cruiser, but had subconsciously ignored it because it looked nice, but wasn't really my type (I was looking at a KIA Sedona). Then I found out two things which got my attention: The PT had a 4-cylinder engine so I could get reasonable gas mileage, and it has lots of room inside. I didn't want to race around in a high-powered sports-thing, or haul around a giant van, and I wanted to use it for driving long distances, so gas mileage is important to me. I'm getting 27 mpg, not bad. It has lots of room, and really has lots of optional interior configurations. Put the back seats down, slide them forward, loosen them up. The seats have suitcase handles which allow you to remove them easily if you want to haul some lumber or whatever. In my mind, when something is new, it is nearly impossible to imagine hauling stuff, but when it gets older, it is really great to have a functionality you can work with. That makes the PT something usable in the long term (probably 20 years or more). Which brings me to a dilemma: Is it a car or a truck? Well, it's a truck.
I have seen some comments about how you may want or need the touring suspension. Well, my base PT without the touring suspension goes smartly around curves. Even though I don't really push it, my PT handles really well on curves, and begs you to notch it up a bit. The power steering feels really good, which probably surprised me some. It goes where you steer it, and handles just fine.
I get 27 MPG on regular gas, with the manual transmission. It goes just fine from San Jose to LA, and goes 75 or 80 just fine. The engine has lots of valves, and 150 Horsepower. I've noticed that the engine seems to really start pulling strong in midrange, which should be an attribute of an engine like this. Lots of people are complaining that the PT has only the 4, and maybe a turbo if you want. But the base 4 is really strong, and does just fine for me. I don't think a bigger engine will solve anything. Maybe.
I really have a problem with this car. It is white. I think it looks great. Other people are always asking me abut it and are waving at me. This hasn't really happened to me before. But the dilemma is that I am looking for something to buy for it to make it look nicer, but this has already been done. I am totally amazed that with this vehicle, someone has performed concentrated effort on everything you look at. The seats are nice, the dash is great with round instruments, easy to see and understand. On the right side is a panel which is shiny silver. There are lots of cup holders and storage areas, including a drawer under the right seat (what an idea!). The doors have map pockets, and the seatbacks do, too. The rear storage area has lots of configurations, including a tailgate-table. The cue-ball shift knob is something that (obviously) is a custom touch. I sort-of think that the designers of the interior were laughing all the time, because they really enjoyed what they were doing. The PT just doesn't need anything to make it look better.
The car runs fine. I really like it. I have a lot of new "PT friends". The vehicle, I think, is redefining what cars are (in that it is either a car or a truck, or both). It is probably an instant classic. I remember that in 1965, I could have bought a 65 mustang, but I didn't. I will remember that in 2002, I could have bought a PT Cruiser, and I did.
This is a long-term reliability test. It will be updated occasionally as we progress.
Update Aug 21, 2002: I am continually impressed with the build quality and attention to detail.
I did find an interesting thing which I am working on: The IOD fuse. I had a Clarion DVS9755z DVD system with a Jensen XA4150 600 watt amp installed. After that, I get a continuous message of "no fuse". It looks like the IOD fuse, located under the hood, has gone out because of the stereo installation. The fuse cannot be checked, because it controls the airbags. It is also contained in a plastic holder which refuses to let the fuse come out (it goes up and down, but won't come out). So, I have been unable to change it out. The IOD (Ignition off draw) fuse is supposed to be lifted when you leave the car unattended for over 21 days, to avoid having a dead battery from the on-circuits (like the airbags and stereo settings), while the car is being stored with the ignition off. Then, you push it back down, later. It looks like the PT runs fine, but the interior lights don't work.
So, at this time, it is a very interesting situation. I'll let you know how it turns out. Maybe I should install a bigger fuse now that I have a high power stereo system (?).
UPDATE 12-18-2002: I have become aware that the PT is built in Mexico. I am really impresed with the fit and finish on the PT. I think the Mexicans really know how to build a car. They should be proud. Other people who have driven a PT tell me that they think that the Mercedes heritage shows. I also know that girls like them. Many people ask me how i like my PT, and they tell me they are saving for one. That's great! I now have 8,000 trouble-free miles, and am getting 33 MPG.
UPDATE Feb 4, 2003: the PT is running just fine. I am now located in Huntsville, Alabama. During recent cold spell, the heater warmed up quickly - GREAT! Getting good gas mileage, plus using the PT as a truck, carrying stuff all over town. The PT is an intelligent decision.
Update 6-10-03: PT now has 14,000 trouble-free miles. I think it runs fast, even though people say it needs a bigger engine, which I don't want. The standard 150 HP 4 is just fine, and runs on regular gas from Costco. One thing I always do (at 10,000 miles) is switch from regular motor oil to Mobil 1 Synthetic oil. It has worked well for me since 1980, in my 1965 El Camino with a 350 HP 327, 1984 Mustang convertible, 1989 Ford Ranger, 2002 Kia Rio and now the 2002 PT. You can easily get 7,000 miles between changes. I get the oil changed at WalMart for $30. You notice the change quickly, and it seems to run fine for many, many miles. Try it, you'll like it. I expect the PT to last much longer with Mobil 1.
