            I am not a car person.  I drive a car to get me there.  To me, a car is not a status symbol or a luxury item; it is a tool.  However, a car should be driven and not be in the shop.  This is why we own two Acura Integra cars.

I am very satisfied with our two Acura cars.  They provide a nice ride, they are comfortable and sporty.  My 2 door coupe has tons of storage in the back; its deceiving.  They get fairly good gas mileage (25 miles per gallon).  But most important, they are very low maintenance.  Mostly what we do is change brake pads, change oil, clean them.  They are not in the shop all the time with problems.

My husband used to own a BMW.  It was constantly in the shop.  Every time he would pick it up, it was very expensive ($1000).  Now, all we do with our two Acura cars is take them in for routine maintenance.

Here is a summary of what we own and the repair record:

1990 2-door Integra
	Currently, this car has 170,000 miles on it.  It needed a CV joint while under extended warranty and a new transmission at about 100,000 miles.

1992 4-door Integra:
	Currently this car has 150,000 miles on it.  The very first problem at all surfaced at 130,000 miles.  Some sort of problem with suspension and CV joints.

In short, they just run, and run, and run.
