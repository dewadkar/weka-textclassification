              As a man ages, it is only natural for him to seek ways to appear younger, more vibrant, not so worn out.  This "mid-life crisis" is manifested in many ways, among them, buying a new car.  While many men opt for the overt show-off-ness of a flashy sportscar, more reasonable men turn to luxury.  Case in point, the 2002 Toyota Camry.  
  The day this car came home, I recall feeling overjoyed at the prospect of cruising the streets of my town in style.  Style I could rub in the face of all those kids who'd made fun of me in high school.  All those who said I'd never amount to anything.  All those still driving their 1986 Civics.  The '02 Camry is a beautiful example of quality Japanese engineering.  It is apparent, however, that the Camry is a car made for Americans.
  The interior of the Camry is cavernous, reminiscent of my extensive wine cellar.  The plush upholstery is accentuated by shiny, silvery seatbelts.  Gazing into the rear-view mirror, one gets the sense of looking into the past, at all those poor suckers behind you without the Camry's impressive V6 engine at their control.  
  As I rolled through town in the Camry, I often got the sense that people were checking out my ride.  Sure enough, numerous people commented on good I looked in the car.  Of course, I couldn't hear them over the tunes emanating from the Camry's powerful stereo.  Enough speakers, amps and watts to bring the party everywhere I go.  
  This particular vehicle was painted a fetching silver with a gray trim and gray interior.  Flashy, but not as flashy as that bald guy in the gold BMW.  I mean, its like he's trying too hard.
  The ride itself is like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.  Crazy stuff may be going on around you, but in the Camry, you're pretty much oblivious.  The quiet engine is misleading as the Camry is more than capable of keeping up with most comparable luxury cars.  The Camry handles like road like Paul handled The Beatles.  No paved road is beyond the Camry's ability. 
  The Camry is America's most popular car and for good reason.  The ride is smooth, the engine is beastly, ladies dig the lines, and the trunk fit three golf bags and a thirty-pack of Coors Light.  Not to mention the durability.  This car now has thirty-five thousand miles on it and never had problem.  Just change the oil, Armor All the tires, and fill it with gas for years of fooling people into thinking you're hipper than you are.
