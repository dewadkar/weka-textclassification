            Everyone in my family has owned a honda accord at one time or another...my uncle, my grandmother, my aunt, my mother...and now me.  I am the proud owner of a 1990 Honda Accord Sedan (four doors).  If I were to buy another vehicle, I would most definately purchase another honda.  These babies get great gas milage, require little maintenence, and what maintaining they do need is just routine things like oil changes, new tires...things like that,which anyone can do themselves.  These cars are fairly attractive in their old age. My only gripe about these gems is that All hondas older than 1995 have a problem with a leaky trunk seal, therefore if left untreated, the trunk rusts from the inside out.  Most Honda owners are privy to this, and have already taken care of the problem.  But other than that, honda accords are dependable in the harsh Minnesota winters...(they drive remarkably well in snow and ice...) they get great gas milage, they seat up to five people in a semi-compact car, and they last FOREVER!  Mine is eleven years old and still going around like I just drove it off the lot!  We bought the car in New York and drove it across country with 100,000 miles on it three years ago without incident.  WHEW!  These cars are affordable, (I was a high school student) dependable, and just all around great vehicles.
