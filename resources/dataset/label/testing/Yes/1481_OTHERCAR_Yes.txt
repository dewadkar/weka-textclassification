            The Mercury Cougar has been on sale in various forms for many years. The latest model is much different than the model sold in the early '90's. The new Cougar, which has been on sale for a few years, is based on the Ford Mondeo/Contour and Mercury Mystique. The Contour and Mystique are no longer sold in America. The Cougar is really just a two-door version of that family car, with much sportier styling. The first-year sales of the Cougar were the best, with the sales shrinking each year. Ford may not build a second Cougar, in the next years, or they may make a Focus-based version. 

The Cougar adds a S version this year. It has a more powerful version of the 2.5L Duratec V-6 in the Cougar V-6. My review is about the Cougar V-6. I have not been in a Cougar with the 2.0L Zetec engine. This is the same engine as the Focus ZX3. With a five-speed manual transmission, this engine should be enough power. But, if you are looking at a four-cylinder Cougar, check out the Focus ZX3 as well, in my opinion, it is a much better deal (you can buy them for about $13K, with many popular features standard).

The Cougar V-6 has a 2.5L 24-valve Duratec engine with an output of 170 horsepower at 6250 rpm and 165 lb-ft of torque at 4250 rpm. The S-tuned version puts the horsepower to 196 hp at 6750 rpm. The torque is barely increased. Ford should have thought about putting their 3.0L V-6 engine in the Cougar S. It is in the Taurus, Escape and Mazda Tribute. It has 200 hp and wouldn't have to work as hard as the Duratec, this would probably increase engine life. 

The V-6 I am referring to was very powerful. It had an automatic transmission, which shifted very smoothly. The handling on this car seemed to be very much like the Contour. I enjoyed driving the Contour because it was so fun to drive. The same is true with the Cougar. The Cougar was equipped with four-wheel independent suspension; MacPherson in the front and a Quadralink system in the back. The Cougar feels very nimble, and with the rack and pinion steering, it is very responsive. I felt like I could go around turns much faster than in other moderately-priced two door cars. 

The brakes are also responsive. The Anti-lock Braking System with four wheel disc brakes are much better than the front discs and rear drum brakes. I would highly recommend anyone looking at his car to add the ABS. The four-wheel discs are an added plus. I not only felt more confident with these brakes over other cars I have driven, I felt like the pedal was also responsive. The combination of the Cougar's engine, suspension, steering and brakes makes the Cougar a great deal in the sports car market. 

The accommodations of the Cougar are just average. The seats have support for the lower back and hold you well, but the rear seats give very little headroom. With a moon roof, there is even less headroom. The rear seats feel and look like they were dugout from the bench: they are very low and curved at the bottom like a cup. The front head rests don't really hold your head very well, and they are more like cushions just stuck on top of the seat. 

The controls are very easy to use. I have found that Ford had good layouts for their controls. The radio and climate controls are very easy to understand (rotor controls for the heat and A/C) and high enough that there is no need to reach very far. The display is also easy to understand. The speedometer and tachometer are in the center, with engine temperature and fuel on the sides. If the driver doesn't use his/her seatbelt, there is a light and bell that will ring every 20 seconds or so. It is a VERY helpful reminder, and gets annoying if you don't wear your seatbelt.  This car is very comfortable for two front passengers, and can take four people for short trips. If there are two smaller kids in the back, longer trips are possible. Four adults can't sit in the Cougar for long. If you need extra space, look at the Focus. 

Overall, the Cougar is a great car. It is fun to drive and not over-priced. It has stiff competition from the Eclipse and Celica. It is also comparable to the Accord and Camry two-doors. I enjoyed the Cougar, and I think that most other young people will as well.<br><br>
