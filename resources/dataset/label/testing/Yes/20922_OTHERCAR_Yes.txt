                 The New Chrysler PT Cruiser is a very attractive, luxurious, smaller S.U.V.  The new PT Cruiser offers leather and sleek styling at an affordable price.  I purchased mine for $17,998.00.
  
I strongly recommend this vehicle for anyone who wants something sporty, roomy, and at an affordable price.  The front resembles a &quot;new&quot; Prowler and the back resembles a V W Beetle.  Although I bought an automatic, I have driven a friend's PT Cruiser manual and it was just as simple if not easier.

Lots of people buy a car for its appearance, and don't even glance at its performance.  Well, if you are remotely interested in buying this car, don't hesitate because you think it has poor performance because it is such an affordable price.  Chrysler just decided to mark their cars down a little.

  The new PT Cruiser combines to of the best things.  Chrysler and an S.U.V.  The new PT Cruiser is also great in size because it can carry a full load, and can also fit anywhere in parking.  Forget trying to park an Excursion or having a little Chevrolet Tracker that won't carry anything.  Buy a reasonable performance car combined with luxury, room, and the Chrysler charm of approval.
