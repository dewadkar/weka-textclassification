            The Volvo 940 is a car which has it's up's and downs however for me the ups pretty much outweigh those downs.  So I'll go over all the aspects of the car and you can decide for yourself.

Appearance: I like it.  Its got that semi sporty look to it.  

Sunroof:  That�s my favorite part.

Size:  A little wide, but most volvo's are.  

Driving:  It drives beautifully.  No sudden jerks or anything.  Good handling.  Turning radius is awesome you can make a U-turn at like 20 miles per hour and end up in the left lane (usually :-)

Radio:  Interception is bad at times however, the sound quality makes up for it.  The bass is pretty good and the overall sound quality w/ tapes and cd's is very nice.

Safety:  I don�t even need to talk about this one.  2 driver side airbags.  Tank like appearance.  (Giant foamy bubble that inflates around your car before a crash...j/k)  But you get the impression.  Volvo's probably best known for its safety and I am confident that if I get into an accident I will be very safe.  I haven't tried any highway derby racing yet...but if I did...I'd feel safe.

Seats:  brown treated Leather.  that�s all I gotta say

Back Seats:  (yea)  Well the head rests are a little too low down but its alright your just more likely to fall asleep in the back.

Gas Mileage:  Ehhhhhhhh....its ok.  its no manual

Acceleration:  Ehhhhhhhhhhh....its ok.  its not BAD.

Shiftlock Override:  There is this button on the car called Shiftlock override I'm not exactly sure what it does but its one advantage is you can say something like &quot;DONT PUSH THAT BUTTON!!!!!&quot;

Cup Holders:  THERE ARE NONE!!!!! STARBUCKS YOU HAVE NO PLACE IN SWEDAN!

Handling in bad weather:  The only major reason not to get this car.  It's not that good in the rain and even worst in the snow.  If you live in a place where it doesn't snow much its fine.  If you got snow a lot in the winter I wouldn't suggest it.  

Quality...will it last forever?:  Volvo's have been known too.  Those Europeans sure know how to build stuff to last.  You can get up to about 200,000 miles with only minor repairs probably.     

cost:  used you can get it for like 10,000 - 15,000 

Who should get this car?
    1. mother
    2. friendly motorist
    3. former tank driver (safety)
    4. trendy people
    5. other (if you liked the review)

Who shouldn't get this car?
    1. alpine skier living in the alps
    2. racecar driver
    3. caffeine addict (although you can purchase a little cup holding thingy)
