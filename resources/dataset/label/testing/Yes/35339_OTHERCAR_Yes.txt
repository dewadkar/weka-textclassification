            I got this, my first minivan, over 2 years ago. It was the last day of the month and the dealership wanted to improve their numbers, so they gave me a very good price. We were actually planning to get a new Voyager or Caravan but were tempted by the luxurious leather seats and all the other options that the Town and Country provides.

It has a very comfortable interior and the leather is resistant to spills and mess from kids. The ride is very comfortable and very little noise gets in from the road or engine (the loudest noise when driving seems to be wind on the roof rack). The 3.8L engine is definitely the one you want for a vehicle this size, even if you aren't going for luxury.

I have also been able to use it to move large pieces of furniture such as bookcases, tables, etc - removing the seats is easy. Getting them back in again takes a little practice.

The downside is that I have had more than the expected number of repairs done on the car. I am glad that I got an extended warranty, because it has paid for itself. That is a bad sign indeed.

Firstly, the previous owners must have spilt Coke all over the front of the van at some point, because many of the switches and buttons stick or don't register properly, and when the CD holder handle broke off, I found a load of brown goo behind it. That is not Chrysler's fault, though (apart from the flimsily built handle).

The first major thing to go wrong was the air conditioning, almost as soon as I bought it. I had to get the compressor replaced, which would have been expensive if I had had to pay for it. Around a year later the oxygen sensor failed. More recently the starter had intermittent problems and had to be replaced.

Overall I have been very happy. Nothing has happened yet to stop the vehicle from being operable, but the things that have gone wrong have been on the expensive side. The warranty was worth it.<br><br>
