              I thought this review would be negative considering my past experience with a Nissan Sentra, I was pleasantly surprised however and have just about nothin' but praise for this new version.

  Recently i went car shopping with a friend, they were interested in a compact within the $15k-$17k territory.  We hit quite a few places and honestly, if i don't have to deal with a car salesperson when I don't need to, i typically won't.  Unfortunately...

  Anyway, the field was full of underpowered, small, and very basic cars.  The Honda Civic was the first off the list, considering that in this price range the damn car came with NOTHING.  Toyota eventually dropped off because the Corolla is more of a sub-compact.  We ended up looking at the Ford Focus and the Nissan Sentra SE-L.

  Ford ended up off the list because the dealership had run out of the ZTS model (standard model w/their version of a vtec engine) and wasn't sure when they'd be getting more in.

  We ended up at a Nissan dealership, originally we were looking at the Sentra GXE, until we noticed that the SE-L was only slightly more than the GXE and came with a whole hell of a lot more standard features.

  My friend decided on getting an automatic, a waste in my mind.  At any rate, I've said this before, and I'll say it again, I hate the shape of the auto shifter in Nissans.  Off the line the engine generates a good amount of power, enough to set your back into the seat.  As the engine zips through the gears you'll notice that there's a lack of engine noise from the bay.  Enough noise for you to appreciate the sound of the engine going through the gears, and enough lack of noise to appreciate any conversation or the stereo in the car.

  However, when you get up to normal freeway speeds, (55+ mph) there is a bit of road noise, mostly coming from the tires and I feel it's mostly because the tread is in fine condition with little wear on the tires.  I will update this at a later date after the vehicle is a bit more <i>broken in</i>. 

  The SE-L comes with a 2.0L 16V 4 cylinder 140hp engine, quite an advantage over the GXE's 1.6L 4 cylinder 115 hp engine.  It's peppy enough to get you on the freeway without feeling like you're driving a compact car with a compact engine. In fact, considering the light weight of the car (2646 lbs!) it actually feels like a bigger engine.  Again, response is good, I know the new Sentra carries 6 more horse power, but I'm not entirely sure that that would make THAT much of a difference.

  Personally, I'm waiting for Nissan to develop a variable valve engine like Honda, Toyota, and Ford have done so they can stick it in Sentra, that should make things interesting.

  The Sentra SE-L definitely drives and feels like a sports car without actually being one.  Great for insurance purposes, eh?  Though it's design and interior layout may feel like a passenger car don't let that fool you.  The engine is based on their old race engine that they pulled out of the Datsun 510 (i actually owned one of those, great engine, but that's a whole 'nother story).  I believe they actually used that engine on their early 280Z models.  This particular engine was also used on Datuns race cars which outperformed the BMW's on the track at that time.

  The SE-L comes with a sport-tuned suspension and a front and rear stabilizer bar.  The SE-L definitely handles better than it's underpowered counter-part (GXE).  Certainly more eager to take turns and able to shoot through with a minimal amount of body roll and a noticeable lack of flexing through the chassis.  It also comes with front/rear disc brakes and add to that the bigger 15&quot; alloy wheels and the SE-L makes for a competent SCCA vehicle.

  Because of those suspension refinements the SE-L really grips it through the turns.  There's a minor amount of roll through the turns, but it pulls through them so solidly that you won't have time to complain.  As I stated before, this is an automatic and acceleration could be a little better, but that's more or less the transmission choice rather than the vehicle itself.  Again, Nissan, when are you gonna develop a variable valve engine for your cars?

  The disc brakes make for some decent stopping power, however there's a bit too much freeplay with the pedal.  Roughly a 1/4&quot;, I don't like that, though I'm sure that could be easily remedied with a simple turn of screw.  Other than that the brakes do what they're supposed to.  Press pedal, car stops.  They're not big calipers with cross drilled rotors, but still, there's a decent amount of stopping power.

  Other amenities that the SE-L comes with are:  remote/keyless entry, the above-mentioned 15&quot; alloys, sliding moonroof, am/fm/cass/cd, sporty bucket seats, leather wrapped steering wheel, fog lights, power-windows, power-locks, and a truly funky speedo/tach display.  It's funky in that the display is typically white-faced w/black numbers, but when you turn on the lights at night the display turns black with white numbers.

  The interior is basically the same as the regular Sentra models.  However, the front buckets are a bit stiffer (see sporty bucket seats).  Taking that into account it makes for a smooth ride as you zip through the turns, the seats are firm enough so you don't go flying all over the damned place and the snug side supports definitely do their job. 

  All the controls are in the typical Nissan places.  No big difference from their cars of the early nineties, to be honest, and pretty much the same instrument layout that you can expect from any other Nissan.  The interior space is decent, but don't expect to stick four six-footers in there.  Certainly more geared toward either taller people with shorter friends or a family just starting out (considering the price). 

  Typically the interior of cars in this price range seem cheap and not very well put together.  However, the Sentra SE-L has a pretty well done interior, the cloth they chose has enough warmth to be inviting, yet it doesn't seem like it's a cheap material.  All the seams are pretty well done and nothing sticks out in the interior as being cheap or not well made.  The resulting fit and finish of the upholstery leaves you thinking that you've probably gotten away with a VERY good deal. 

  However, I have two complaints about the interior and they're pretty minimal.  Number one, the cupholder.  To be blunt, the cupholder sucks.  For some reason it doesn't seem like it comes out all the way, a regular ol' 16 oz. container will fit snugly.  In that the cupholder hugs the drink (as it should) and the back of the cup will be flush against the stereo!  Whyyyyyyyyy!?  Was it such a big problem to extend the length of the cupholder about a 1/2&quot;?  That would've easily solved that problem.

  Anyway, the second problem is the fact that after paying roughly $16.5k for this car it doesn't come with an ashtray or cigarette lighter.  Supposedly you have to order the &quot;Smokers Package&quot;.  Y'know, it might just be me, but after spending that much cash on a car, i would expect all the standard...and let me reiterate that, STANDARD, equipment including a stupid ashtray and cigarette lighter.

  All in all, the car is  a pleasure to drive, peppy with good handling.  The turning radius is sufficient, however the steering wheel seems a bit small for some reason.  The car is a looker too.  Nice dynamic styling, definitely an attention grabber.  Well it might be because it's this funky bright blue (actually looks almost the same as the electric blue on the Suzuki SV-650).  

  Well worth the money, if you're looking for a sporty car and don't wanna spend an arm and a leg, the Sentra SE-L is DEFINITELY a car worth taking the time to check out.  It's a good looking car that comes with a whole lot of options for a little bit of price.  <br><br>
