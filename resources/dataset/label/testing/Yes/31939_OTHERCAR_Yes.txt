            Bottom line: this car is a great value. Even for a Toyota the 94/95 Celicas are known for their outstanding reliability. Not only is this car reliable it has great looks from both the front and the back. My only major complaint about this car is the lack of power / lack of modifications available. I would not recommend this car for anyone who wants to drive competitively or drag race with friends.

Everything about this car is well designed. Unfortunately pictures of this car do not do it justice. In person the exterior of the Celica is one of the most beautiful designs on the road today. The interior is also well designed with the gauges easily viewable and no major blind spots for the driver. Handling is another strength for the Celica. While power is lacking, the car easily handles what modest power the engine provides. The tires stick effortlessly and the wheel turns very predictably. 

As I mentioned before the Celica could use some more HP but this may be due to the fact that I am driving the 1.8L version. I'm not completely sure how much HP the 1.8L is putting out but I am guessing its around 115 or 120, which is pretty low for a car of this size. Either way, the car functions quite well with the power it has; added power isn't a neccesity but a mere luxury. Lastly I've noticed that the windows tend to fog easily in humid or cold weather. This isn't a huge problem as the Celica has an effective climate control system.<br><br>
