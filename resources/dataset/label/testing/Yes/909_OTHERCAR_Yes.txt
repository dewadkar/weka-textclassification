            When I first set my eyes upon the Lincoln LS, I couldn't tell it was a Lincoln! With it's sporty curved body, the car is sizzling hot. The body is just the start, with the optional wheels it is truly amazing to look at. Also, it is a Lincoln, so you know you'll get a smooth ride with the addition of having the power under your foot of a sports car.
Inside the car is also very very nice. It's leather interior is very comfortable, the styling is great to look at, and it fits the car perfectly.

It comes with a V6 engine, but the interest of a V8 has become so popular that Lincoln will be making another model of the LS with a V8 in it. That's great news for the family member who loves sports cars, but has to have a luxury family car-now you can have both!

The car's looks are awesome, and even though it has a V6 and isn't truly a sports car, it sure seems like it. For the price that you pay for this, it is money well spent. Every time I see one of these pass me or pull up next to me I stare at it, and can't wait till the V8 model comes out.<br><br>
