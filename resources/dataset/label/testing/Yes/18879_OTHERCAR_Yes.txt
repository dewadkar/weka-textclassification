            My first car purchase was a 1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse.  I got it used and I was so excited about getting a car that I didn't really research as much as I should have, nor did I really shop around.  I went looking at what was in my price range in the area and bought the first one I liked.

In the lot there was a Saturn and the Eclipse sitting next to each other.  I liked both, but the Eclipse had a sun roof.  

I loved that car and treated it well.  I had it for less than three years before I got into and accident and decided to trade it in for whatever I could get toward a Jeep.  I didn't get much.

Plus side:

Sports car without the huge price tag.  I paid less than $10,000 dollars for my Eclipse.  It didn't have the best engine options with only four cylinders and wasn't turbo charged, but it had a good deal of pick up and could really move.  I had the speedometer maxed out at 115, but I had to be going faster than that.

The sun roof was really cool.  The style is sleek and sexy. 

Down sides:

Cramped for space.  I'm 6'-1&quot; tall and I literally had to squeeze in and out of that car.  I'd get some weird looks when I popped out and several people asked just how I fit inside that thing.  Getting in and out was hard, but once inside, I had plenty enough leg room to drive and as long as I didn't put the card board insert in to convert the sun roof into a moon roof, I had enough head room.

You can fit people in the back seat if they don't have any legs and they look like Alley Mcbeal.  I somehow squished 5 people into that car for a thankfully short trip to get lunch.  I think I still have a steering wheel imprint on my chest from the experience.

Middle of the road:

With the hatch back, you could actually put some rather large items into the car.  I bought a computer desk that was two large boxes and I was able to put them into the car and close the trunk.  However, I was somewhat blind on the right hand side for the trip home.

The seats may be small, but they are well padded so they are comfortable for long trips.  

I had a stock sound system in the car and it seemed OK for me.  If you want to be able to hear the music outside of the car though, you will want to upgrade the system.  

I've seen some comments declaring this car a lemon.  Again, I only had mine for three years, but I had no major malfunctions during those years.  I had a tune up and basic maintenance, but that was it.

If you get into a fender bender, be prepared to be shocked.  I had a minor accident and there was some damage to the passenger side front corner.  Those little pieces that make up the headlight assembly are very expensive.  I had no structural damage, but I had a $3000 repair bill.  Hence the switch to the Jeep instead of sticking with the Eclipse.

I got $800 for the car as is toward the Jeep.  The dealer knew I was looking for more on the trade in, so he knocked a grand off the price of the Jeep too, so I guess you could say I got $1800 for it.  Either way the vehicle does not hold it's value well.

I did have a problem with the fuse for the cigarette lighter.  It seems like it only has enough power for a cigarette lighter and nothing else.  I kept blowing the fuse with any accessories I tried.
