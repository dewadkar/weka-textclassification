            The Sony MVC-FD83 digital camera is a great buy.  Like some digital cameras, this camera doesn't use film, but rather computer disks.  Instead of spending money on loads of film with pictures that aren't even good pictures, you can take pictures on the disks.  If they picture doesn't look the way you want it to, you can just delete it.  If you do like the picture then just save on your computer hard drive, so you have to pay nothing for additional disks because you wont need them.  With this camera in particular you don't have to just take pictures.  You can take short (but not too short) movie clips just like a camcorder.  This is ideal if you want to send a friend a movie clip of yourself that you made.  Just use the Sony MVC-FD83, then stick the disk into your computer and then it's just like any computer file.  The pictures are of very good quality and I highly recommend this camera.  Go out and buy one for yourself today!<br><br>
