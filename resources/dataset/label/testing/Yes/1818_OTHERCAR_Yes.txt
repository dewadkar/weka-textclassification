            When I started looking for a new car i decieded that i wanted a SUV. Because of the large exterior it gave me the sence that I was save. We looked at all the Suv's and were stuck between the Ford Expedition and the Dodge Durango. In the end it was the price and the extras we got for the money. We figured that for the same price the durango gave us atomatically 3 rows of seating as apposed to the expedition where you would have to pay more to get the 3rd row of seating. Also iI wanted a big car to feel safe in but for me the Expedition was just huge a monster vehical. We also have a Ford F-150 and I felt when I test drove the expedition  like a was driving the truck instead. So for me the size was so right. it was a ton of cup holders which i love there are 3 in the front seat. 1 of those is made especially for a coffee mug its great. also there is a center console that holds most of my cds/tapes and a place for maps. the front 2 doors have an area built in them to hold more stuff (i use it for all my cds I have a lot) also there is a console above for the garage door clickers, a sunglass holder, and a compass/fuel gage/tripomiter/and weather gage. The only dislick i have is that the dasnboard is made really cheap. It cant take any presure. When I was changing the flow of the a/c the dash cracked its a tiny crack but still it shouldnt have happened. But speaking of the A/C it not only has the 1 in the dash but it has another on the overhead concole and another on the floor byt the cup holders. so your able to keep the 3rd row cool and the 2nd also. Dollar for Dollar I love my durango and glad i went for it!!!!!
