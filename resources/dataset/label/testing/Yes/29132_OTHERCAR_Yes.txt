            I was introduced to this camera at the CES show in Las Vegas Nevada two years ago at a booth where 1000 of them for sale. This caused me to wonder if they were a flop on the market and were now being pushed out the back door to get rid of them, but soon discovered that this little camera was very powerful, easy to use, had zoom capability and was affordable!
After playing with it for 15 minutes or so, I decided to part with the $ and took it home. I just loved taking pictures with it but hated the speed of the download process via the port cable that was included. I soon purchased a USB card reader and then the package was perfect! 
This camera will take pictures (while in the &quot;Best&quot; configuration) that are better than most printers will reproduce accurately! The close-up feature is great, with the LCD screen you see just what the picture will look like and where to focus while do any close up work. I do a lot of eBay selling of small items and this feature makes it possible to put crystal clear shots of very small items in my Ads and has increased sales because of it.  The rechargeable batteries that came with the unit are still taking a charge and working great, they last about 200 to 250 average shots between charges. I have taken over 4500 pictures with this camera and still love it! I use a Kodak DC265 at work and find that my own DC220 is just as good. The software that comes with this unit is very good, it has many features that the average photographer will never need, it has a slide show feature that is very nice for viewing an event such as the Family Vacation etc. (you can throw the old 35mm slide projector out the back door now with optional &quot;slide Capture&quot; equipment for this camera)
I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get into the digital mode for photography, and the price is falling like a rock! (check eBay before you purchase anywhere else)
Great Camera, Great Price, User Friendly, great software, but get a USB card reader to down load your pictures!
