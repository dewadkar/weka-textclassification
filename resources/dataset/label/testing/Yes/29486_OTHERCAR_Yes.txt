            We purchased a Kodak DC240 camera in January 2000
to take digital pictures on vacations and family events.
To date we have taken about 1000 pictures.  I have
found the quality of the pictures is great. I just can
snap and click and the picture comes out nice.  The
Kodak box says �Incredible Pictures.  Incredibly easy�
and I agree fully with this statement.

The DC240 captures JPEG images on a flash card.  With
a setting of medium resolution, you can get about 60
pictures on a 16MB flash card.  We got a 16MB flash
card for $60.  The camera came with a 8MB flash card. 
The flash card can be changed similar to how a floppy
disk works in a computer.

<b>Features</b>
This camera came with lots of cool features.  The
features that I have found most useful are:
Zoom(6x) 
Autofocus
One touch setting for close-ups (I.E. flower or butterfly)
Easy to set flash to off, on, or automatic
Ability to plug camera into video input jack of TV to
show slide show
Add date stamp to pictures
Self-timer
LCD display (you can view the picture right after you
take it.  You can even delete the picture with a touch of
a button and re-take it!)

<b>Image quality</b>
We have found that the �better� or medium quality to
provide adequate image quality for our picture taking
needs.  I have emailed, printed, and sent to be
developed.  I have been satisfied with the quality at the
�better� resolution setting.

<b>Dowloading to computer</b>
We bought our camera at a computer store.  They had a
promotion where they included a flash card reader.  The
flash card reader plugs in through our USB port on the
computer.  It is easy to use!

<b>Battery life</b>
I have not had a problem with battery life. The camera
comes with re-chargeable batteries.  I have taken up to
70-80 pictures in 1 day without having to re-charge the
batteries.
The camera has a continuous LCD preview that can be
turned ON.  According to the manual, this will drain the
batteries quickly.  I have not used this feature
extensively.

<b>Somewhat slow</b>
My only con is that it does seem a little slow between
pictures, but this does not bother me! Also, for
example, if I take a picture and then hit the off switch,
it may take a second or 2 until the zoom lens retracts
and the camera powers down. This is because it is still
processing the picture that I last took!

<b>SUMMARY

I recommend this photography enthusiasts and parents who want to capture
pictures of their children.</b>
