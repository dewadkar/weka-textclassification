            My Canon S110 was stolen and I needed something to equal or better it. After much deliberation I realized that I wanted something that was compatible w/ my Sony vaio/handycam/dvd player and desktop. My only option was to either purchase the sony cybershot or purchase a Konica camera ie: Kd-310z which has dual memory slots. (SD card and memory stick!) I was at Fry's and came across an open box buy on this little camera for $239.00. The camera was in MINT condition and  after a little bargaining I managed to get the price down to $199! However there was no memory stick included and the charger was missing. I rushed it home and decided to try something. I still had my charger for my previous canon s110 that was stolen so I decided to see if I could use it to charge my Konica battery. What luck! It was a perfect fit and charged my konica battery in exactly the same amount of time as my previous S110 (1hr -1 1/2 hr) I have been using my camera frequently over the last week and a half and have seen no problems thus far! I was skeptical as to how well this camera would perform. Let me say, it is actually easier than my canon was to use. The menu is very straight forward and after about 5 minutes I knew this camera inside and out. Another popular feature is along w/ the SD card slot, and memory stick slot, there is a small amount of internal memory, allowing the user to take approx. 10 more pictures. After using my "sony" memory stick in my Konica kd-310z, I can simply place the memory stick in my "sony" handycam, "sony" vaio, "sony" desktop and even my "samsung" dvd player w/ memory stick slots to view my pictures!!! I can't believe how easy this thing is to use!(yes i have done it w/ all of them) The pictures come out very crisp and the flash is very powerful for a compact camera. The camera is approx. the same size as my previous s110 but has another advantage; a protective door the covers the lens when closed, and also turns the camera on or off by opening and closing it. One gripe I had w/ my previous s110 was getting fingerprints all over the LCD by admirers that commented on how cute the camera was. On the Konica kd-310z there is a plastic protective cover over the LCD, so fingerprints are a breeze to wipe away. Battery life is good on this camera, equal to that of the Canon S110. I would recommend purchasing an additional battery for the vacation times. So far I have no quibbles about this camera. I also enjoy how durable this camera feels, another strong point that reminded me of my s110. There are other digital cameras on the market that are lighter, but they are made of plastic, and lack the feel of "superior" build. I recommend researching this camera, and even testing one out before placing more money into a Sony.
