            We bought our 1999 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT to replace the awful VW Jetta that we had bought new. (we went through 3 in a total of 2 years due to quality issues!) We drove off the lot in our Silver Legacy wagon for $22k and change. Our car is loaded to with every option available at the time. 

Since then we have never looked back. The car has been wonderful. All we have had to do is change the oil and put gas in the tank. We have made 2 unscheduled stops for minor issues (a squeak in the front brake and a scratchy volume knob on the radio) and both were fixed immediately and the first time. 

After 2 years and almost 36k miles of driving here is my overall impressions of the car.

Positives:

This car sticks to the ground like a piece of gum on a hot sidewalk. The All Wheel Drive system is flawless and works transparently. Its superior to 4WD systems for on road use since it's always there. There is no pushing of buttons or engaging of levers. You will need all wheels gripping the ground when you least expect it. That is what will save you. This car will slog through all the sleet, snow and rain that nature can throw at it. 

The Legacy 2.5GT's suspension is a derivative of the Japanese home market GT-B Turbo Wagon. In Japan there is a cult following of the GT-B (Imagine moms in station wagons with child seats racing Supras). The suspension is taut and makes the car handle like a go-kart. The 16 inch, V-rated, 55 series tires help the handling (and look nice) though the ride is a bit rough over broken pavement.

As I mentioned earlier the fit and finish was excellent and the long term reliability has been wonderful. The design gives it a very European look and it has all those Subaru design "quirks" that make it unique. Also you won't see yourself coming around every other corner (ala Camry or Accord) 

Negatives:

The 165hp that the 2.5 flat four produces is not enough to haul around an AWD system, midsize body, four people and luggage. Though its not any slower than any SUV, I would expect more spirited acceleration from the sporting looks and GT moniker of this car. A turbo or a couple more cylinders would help. 

A few niggling issues, not "make or break":  poor cupholder design (if you have been reading Legacy/Outback reviews you've probably read this a hundred times). Foglights fairly useless. faux hood scoop - useless, funky placement of window switches. 

I love the products that Subaru is producing such as this wagon. I own 2 Subarus, the other is 1995 SVX. I had some issues that came up with the SVX. The service that I had received from Subaru of America has been indifferent to downright rude.(though they did fix Free of Charge a faulty transmission which SVXs are infamous for). Again, I love the products, I could do without SOA's poor service and attitude.  

In summary, this is a great car. Its a fantastic value. I dare you to find another midsize, AWD wagon with all the creature comforts at this price, nothing can touch this. 

We have had 2 wonderful years with it. Unfortunately for us, we can't fit more than 2 child seats in the back. If we have another child we won't have any other choice but to give up the Legacy. Even today we cannot have any passengers outside of me, my wife and the two kids. A third row option seat option would have extended the service life of this wagon. 

My wife says that if Subaru is considering making a minivan, she would buy it sight unseen. I have to admit, before we bought our first Subaru I was not a big fan of Subaurs. Now on our second, I have to admit that both my wife and I are converts.
