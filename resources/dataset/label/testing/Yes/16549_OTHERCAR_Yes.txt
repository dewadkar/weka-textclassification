I just recently purchased a 1992 Nissan 240sx SE with the HICAS system.  The first word that comes to mind when describing this car is.... UNBELIEVABLE.  This car sticks to the road like and corners like it's on rails, especially the models with the HICAS system.  I love the engine, it's not as smooth as one would like, but the power and torque is quite impressive.  The driving position is very good with a good forward view.  One problem about this car is the blind spots.  You've got to be very careful when lane changing.  Driving this vehicle is so much fun that it's very easy to rack up lots of mileage.  Fortunately, this care is very reliable.  If you keep up with regular maintenance, this car can run forever.  There's not too many cars out there that handles as well as this little beauty.  And for all you doubters out there, drive one and you'll never go back to the other available imports out there.<br><br>
