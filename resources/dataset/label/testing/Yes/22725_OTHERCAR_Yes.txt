            In 1996 I purchased a 2-door 1993 Grand Am GT. I quickly named her &quot;Black Beauty,&quot; but over the past couple of years I have aptly renamed her &quot;Black B*tch.&quot; She has been through hell and back. Let me tell you why:

Sometimes, the power windows don't work. Usually they go down, but they stop on the way up, making me sit there in the car, while it seems the windows &quot;re-charge&quot; and I can get them back up. This usually takes between 3-6 minutes. This is very convenient when it happens in the McDonald's drive-through on rainy days.

Everytime I go over a bump, it feels like the car is going to fall apart. Not only that, but one time I hit a bump in the road and the &quot;ding, ding, ding&quot; sound came on and would not shut off until I disconnected my battery. Nice.

When I got the car, the power lock occasionally did not work on the driver side door. Pontiac wanted $300 to fix it. My dad, who is really good at working on cars, took apart my door, found the broken part, and replaced it for $6. $6! 

The tachometer doesn't work sometimes. Everything will be fine, and then all of the sudden it will drop to zero. Weird.

I have had to replace the alternator, which went out on me in rush hour traffic in the busiest part of town.

Some kind of sensor in the cooling system broke, so my car would repeatedly overheat if I sat still for too long. It would cool off if I got the car moving, but again, in rush hour traffic that is not really convenient.

I had a faulty clamp on the radiator hose which made the hose burst. 

Um, what else. Oh yeah. The radio. The factory radio had a CD player in it. It stopped working when the car was 4 years old. At first, it wouldn't work when it was cold outside, so I would have to turn the heater on high and warm the inside of the car up. Eventually it just stopped.  Then, the volume knob broke, so I yanked out the radio and installed an after-market CD/radio.

Why did I buy this vehicle? In 1996 I loved the way it looked. It was smooth and fast, and jet black. It had low miles, and it was a reasonable price. Why do I still drive it? It is paid off. I just got out of college and with student loans and a husband, I can't afford a new car right now.  Plus, I pay more insurance for my wedding ring than I do for the Grand Am.

One last thing. The sun visors have these straps for maps and papers, etc, but they are so stretched out they hang down 6 or so inches from the visor. Really useful. :)

I say:  Don't buy one.<br><br>
