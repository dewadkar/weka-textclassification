            Toyota has introduced a new and exciting automobile in the 2000 Avalon.  This time the Avalon was designed by Calty, Toyota's Southern California design studio.  An exciting automobile to look at, the Avalon XLS is more powerful with an increase to 210 horsepower.  The new Variable Valve Timing(VVTi) adds a new dimension to power that will put you back in the seat.  The Transmission is as smooth as the Lexus 400 I test drove. The new Avalon is quieter than my old one.  This is in part due to 1/8 of an inch thicker glass.  

The dash display shows, temperature, compass direction, miles left with remaining gas, Day/Date, outside temp...etc, etc, etc...can't believe it.

Before you sink a ton of money into those $35,000 plus big luxury cars go drive the Avalon.  You too won't believe the sophistication and quality you can get with this automobile at a fraction of your hard earned money.<br><br>
