            Is it worth the gas money?  In my opinion, no, it isnt.  Sure, the Suburban is a good family car and powerhouse on the road, but there are a lot of minuses to this vehicle.  I will start with the good aspects though.
The goods -  This is a huge car, and definately ideal for a family.  The 2 back seats easily will fit a family with several kids, heck, this car is big enough to comfortably fit many adults in the back.  The leg room in this car is tremendous, and you will definately will be happy with that aspect of the car.  Also, there is a lot of storage space in the back, for carrying everything from groceries to sports equipment to Christmas presents.  Again, this car proves its worth as far as the family concept goes.  Also, everything is geared towards convenience in this vehicle.  The CD player, the radio/dashboard controls are all within convenient reach, and everything down to the rear cupholders is made for the satisfaction of the passenger/driver.  and now for the bad side..

The bads-  In my opinion, this is a very ugly car.  In fact, it looks to me like if it got smashed it would end up like an accordian, being so long and boxy.  Another thing I dont like, is how this car is not as high off the ground as the expedition.  Even though it is longer than the expedition, the higher off the ground, the easier, and more enjoyable, the driving experience is I have found.  Another minus I have found is that this car has braking problems.  Sometimes when you push down, you feel like you should push too hard just to make sure the car will stop.  Another negative aspect is that there is a significant roll when trying to make sharp turns with this car, and that should be expected, just from the looks of it.  ANother negative I have found is clearly the gas mileage.  This big SUV is one of the biggest gas-guzzlers out there, ranking up with the Navigator and Expedition.

Bottom line - This is a great family car and has tons of space, but definately has many negative aspects.  I would also consider the Expedition and Navigatior when SUV shopping.
