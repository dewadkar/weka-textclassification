            Wow! I bought this car about 9 months ago, and have really only had one problem with it. In the red version, cops pull me over! They seem to want to talk about the car!
It really is great looking and the T-tops are air and water tight and easy to remove and attach. 
My main requirement in looking for a car was that it hold my upright bass, and this thing has mungo trunk space. As a sporty hatchola, it's great for road trips and small moves.
This is a sports car, though, so it is not made for family seating in any way, two in front and one small person or two kids in back. I don't consider this a con, because many people who have families or large outings tend to get bigger cars.
I do get great gas mileage, and recently went from Washington DC to Buffalo on what I think was about 2 tanks of gas. I generally get about 40 in the city and around 45 on the highway, so that's pretty cool.
I got this car in a kind of emergency situation, and even though it had obviously taken a beating from the previous owner, I've been able to do quite a lot with it with no problems at all. I can also tell that people are more friendly with me in public places since I got this car, as people stop me just to talk about it.
