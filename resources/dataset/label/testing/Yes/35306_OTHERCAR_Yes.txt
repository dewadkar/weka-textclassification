            I have gotten the chance to ride in and drive my father's 2000 Acura 3.2TL.  It is an amazing car.  The car floats down the road like you wouldn't believe.  The car has excellent acceleration.  The VTEC engine really does its job.  I find myself cruising 10 to 15 miles per hour over the speed limit.  The car is excellent on gas for having so much power.  It will get well over 400 miles to the tank.  The interior is very roomy and comfortable. Back seat occupants have no complaints at all.  The Bose stereo system is wonderful.  A subwoofer is located in the back deck.  The 5 speed automatic transmission is another bright spot.  It shifts down with no hesitation.  I can not find any legitimate faults with the car.  It is everything that a luxury sedan should be, and then some.<br><br>
