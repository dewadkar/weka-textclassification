            The big draw for me to this particular camera was the zoom capability.  It is one of the fewer cameras on the market with a 10X OPTICAL zoom.  I owned a Canon EOS ELAN II with a 28-70 and a 70-210 zoom lenses. My new Olympus replaced the Canon.

I like the fact that the Olympus has threads on the lens so you can add different lenses to it.  There are quite a few accessories out on the market for this camera.

Admittedly, I wished this camera was better than a 2.1 megapixel, but I can't complain.  I mostly use this camera for taking pictures of objects that I want to sell on Ebay so having a bigger megapixel camera wouldn't do me any good in that respect.

The menu takes a little getting used to.  I've had the camera for about 3 months now and finally figuring out which settings I like.  The owner's manual is very thick, there is ALOT to read.  

I don't think this would be a good camera for someone who is a beginner.  Even using it on the program mode, the pictures sometimes don't come out as I would expect.  It takes more fine tuning.  Figuring out what the white balance compensation is trying to do is a bit of a mystery for me too.  However, if you are someone who likes techie gadgets, this camera is for you!

It is relatively lightweight, considering the zoom capability.  It also tries to give a true through-the-lens view of your subject matter.  This helps greatly.  Otherwise, you waste alot of battery power using the LCD screen.  

It is nice that the camera comes with rechargeable batteries.  I find the batteries seem to last a long time.  I had a cheap entry level HP digital camera and I swear I could only get between 20-30 pictures before the batteries were drained. That is why I upgraded.  Boy! What a difference!!!

A small downside is that the flash does not automatically pop up if lighting conditions are less than optimal.  You have to plan ahead and engage the flash yourself.

The camera comes with a small 16mb smart media card.  I didn't know this before, but apparently these smart media cards and the like, have only so much life to them.  They will eventually wear out!  I was surprised by that fact.  But it makes sense when you think that you are constantly writing and erasing on it.

Overall, I REALLY enjoy using this camera.  I am not terribly skilled at using it for taking pictures of moving objects.  There is a learning curve to using it.

My biggest grip is the software that comes with the camera.  It does nothing more than download pictures from the camera.  The naming system is TERRIBLE. It assigns a number to the picture.  At least my cheesy HP program assigned a date along with a number.  Knowing WHEN a picture was downloaded helps put together a "picture diary."  When all I see are numbers for a file, it doesn't help me recall a time frame for when the picture was taken.  To add further insult to injury, you can get a better program from Olympus, but they charge an extra $20.  I think this is highway robbery.  They should give the better program to begin with.  They certainly charge enough for the camera!

Lastly, the price I paid was another attraction.  At the time, I found it cheaper at Comp USA than any online stores or even Ebay.  I got suckered into buying the 2 year extended warranty from CompUSA for an extra $80. I figure something as delicate as this could easily get damaged.  For $40 a year insurance, better safe than sorry.
