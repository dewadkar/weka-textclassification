            I bought a 1998 Honda Accord and ABSOLUTELY love it.  I first looked at Honda's because of their respected name and then became interested after my first test drive.  It was reasonably priced, attractive and SOLID.  I was able to lease my Honda and got a great lease through the Honda company.  I have not had to service my Honda more than just the noraml oil change and regular checkups.  The only major thing that I had to replace is one tire so far and that was my fault because I ran over a muffler that was in the road.  The tires were top-of-the-line.  I replaced one and it cost $150.  The parts on the Accord and all high quality.  The one thing that I love about my Honda, it just turned 2 years old in November 1999, is that it still drives like it is new.  My friends actually tell me it still smells new too.  My fiance has a car that is two years old too and it drives like it is an old car.  He is always trying to get me to let him drive my car because it just feels good.  His car needs new brakes, belts and drives horribly.

I am just so excited about my Accord and know that I will get another one when I trade in.  The only thing I would do differently is get ALL the bells and whistles next time in regards to extras (CD player, leather, etc.)

Can't go wrong with the Honda Accord.<br><br>
