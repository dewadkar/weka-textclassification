            My wife and I decided it was time to get rid of the Firebird and jump on to the wagon due to our little bundle of joy so we looked at the Saturn Wagon and from the test drive we noticed that for a 4 cyl it had good pick up and at the time it felt like it had plenty of room but now it seems like it's not enough (is it ever?). The car has performed flawlessly and is very comfortable but if you are 6'0 (like me) or above I would go with the L-Series wagon since the seat goes back a little further. My wife being 4'11 LOVES this car. She likes the CD player which has not skipped yet even over bumpy roads.One of my gripes with this car is that is says it has 3 cup holders up front but it really only has one in the center console (the other 2 are on the doors and they are a joke). Also if you put the seat all the way back, it's a little cramped for the back seat passengers. Overall this car does what we want it to do and I would recommend it. Very reliable, quiet ride and the gas mileage is great!<br><br>
