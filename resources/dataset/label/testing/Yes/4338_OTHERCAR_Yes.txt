            Originally, I picked the Rodeo in an overcrowded segment over worthwhile competitors like the X-terra, the Escape and the Liberty for its appealing looks and its swift handling during my test drive. Since then, this SUV grew on me in unexpected ways. The responsiveness is beyond my expectations; so much in sync with my commands that it almost feels like a natural extension of me. The V6 engine delivers the acceleration when you most need it; no hesitation on the coldest Michigan days. The high ground clearance makes it possible to take it to rough terrain and not worry much, although the so called "intelligent suspension" is a bit too stiff when going over big bumps. 4WD makes its presence felt when engaged. The partitioning of available space between seats and cargo area is excellent, moreover, the overall dimensions of the vehicle feel quite right (gives you the space you need without the extra weight to drag around). It is interesting that Isuzu makes no effort to push this fine little vehicle and expects consumers to discover it on their own in the midst of the current SUV glut.
