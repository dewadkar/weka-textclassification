                I bought my 2000 GTI a few weeks ago.  I've had a 1994 Camaro since it was new, and I needed to sell it before it lost all resale value.  I wanted something slightly more practical, but still fast.  After researching for a few months, I had settled on a VR6 GTI.  I went out to test drive one, but happened upon a dealership that only had the 1.8T model.  &quot;Hey, why don't you take it out for a spin anyway?&quot;, the salesman said....  Needless to say, I was a changed man when I pulled back in.  I ended up driving a VR6 as well, but still stuck with the 1.8T.

    After I started driving my new car around, everyone that I knew kept saying &quot;It just doesn't seem to fit you....&quot;  After I took them for a drive, however, they understood why I moved to this from my Camaro.

    I was very impressed with the power of the car compared to my Camaro.  Even though it gives up 10 horsepower and 45 lb-ft. of torque, the GTI is much quicker.  The engine is a jewel, and it handles very nicely....everything is solid and extremely well put-together.  I find myself going out of my way after work just so I can drive the car longer (my 3 minute commute turns into about 15 or 20).  I took it out for a drive in the rain the other day, and (with the traction control disengaged) spun the tires all the way through first gear, and halfway through second.  Not bad for a 1.8 liter engine!  This is the same engine that Audi uses in its A4 and TT models.  The TT comes in two flavors: a 180 hp version and a 225 hp version.  The 180 hp version is the EXACT same engine with a different engine-control chip, and the 225 hp one is the same engine with a larger turbo and different chip.  This powerplant definitely offers some good upgrade paths.

    The interior, as I mentioned, is solid and rattle-free.  The materials are pretty high-quality (soft-feel plastics and some rubber for the door handles).  A little on the dark side, but it goes well with the rest of the car.  The gearshift is nicely textured and has a good feel to it.  I've heard bad things about previous VW shifters, but I have no complaints about this one.  There's also a nasty rumor that an automatic transmission is being offered on these cars (for an extra $875!!).  If you want an automatic, you don't want this car.  The GTI (and any small sports car, for that matter) is in the &quot;shift-it-yourself&quot; class.

    The instrument panel is awesome at night (all numbers are blue and dials and info are red....cool).  The stereo is pretty impressive for a stock system(I have the Monsoon upgrade), but the controls are located a little too low for operation without taking your eyes off of the road.  The same thing goes for the climate controls, which take a little while to get used to.  The sunroof control is a nice touch, though....very different than I'm used to, but clever.  Instead of a rocker switch, there's a dial that you can spin to various positions.  Once you set it to the desired position (1/4 open, 1/2 open, tilted, etc.), the roof will open on its own.

    Driving this car definitely embodies the VW idea of &quot;Fahrvergnugen&quot; (German for driving contentment).  It's just fun.  I like having an understated hatchback that I can fit 5 people in one day, and then spin the tires when I drop it into second gear the next day.  The standard equipment (sunroof, alarm system, stereo, ABS, traction control, power everything and more) is wonderful....just make sure that you add the Monsoon system and a CD player.

    The only real problem with this car is that it only drinks premium unleaded.  I guess it's a small price to pay for this much fun.  If I had to choose between the VR6 and the 1.8T again, I'd still pick this one.  It's almost $3000 less, it's lighter, and much easier to bump up to higher horsepower.  I'm just waiting for my warranty to run out to add a few goodies ($400 for a new computer chip = 35 more horsepower and a $2200 turbo upgrade = 225 horsepower....).

    Quick update....I took my GTI to a two-day autocross school recently (Solo II, for those that have heard of it).  I now know why I've read multiple complaints about the soft suspension bits.  The car rolls quite a bit when cornering at the rather high velocities needed to produce a good time, and the tires protest rather loudly.  The engine may make up for it in the straight parts, but I was definitely unimpressed with the stock suspension and tire choice.

    I do have to give Volkswagen credit, however, because the car never misbehaved or did anything unexpected while I was in the middle of a corner.  I'm planning on purchasing new tires very shortly (definitely something other than the Continentals that are on it now), and I'd suggest purchasing a nice set of 16 inch wheels (I think 17 inches is a little too much for daily driving) as well, if you can afford it.

    Anyway....thanks for reading to the bottom.  Let me know what you think!<br><br>
