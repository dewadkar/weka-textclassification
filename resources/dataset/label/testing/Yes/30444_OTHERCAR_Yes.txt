              I just returned from a road trip in my mothers 2000 Toyota Corolla LE.  This particular Corolla was equipped with an am/fm radio/cassette, dealer installed CD player, cruise control, side-airbags (unusual for this price range) and a 5-speed manual transmission.

  The looks of this car are not going to turn any heads but it does have some nice lines.  After climbing into the Corolla and tilting the wheel down (the tilt steering only travels a few inches), I realized how snug the cabin is, but the controls are well laid out and the seat provides good support.  I am only five-seven so someone tall might find the cabin cramped.

  The LE's power locks and windows add to the convenience of this car; the drivers-side window button is illuminated at night with the word &quot;auto&quot; making it easy to find in the dark.  The trunk and gas releases are both located below the drivers left leg; the trunk release is larger than the gas release so that you can tell them apart without looking.  The trunk has an ample 12 cubic feet of storage.

  The pop-out cup holders, under a storage space on the console, work well, however when in use they cramp the path of the stick when shifting.  The instruments are well laid out and well lit in the dark; a digital thermometer is located near the odometer

.  The lighting system in the Corolla has an interesting feature; in addition to the day time running lights which only operate the headlights, the tail-lights and dash-light come on automatically when it's dark.  You can start the car at night and drive without turning the lights on, after a few seconds the tail and dash lights will come on automatically.  Another nice feature that is standard on this trim line is the power mirrors that can be changed by controls on the left side of the dash.

  The back seat of the Corolla is a little cramped but can be comfortable provided you are not tall and the trip does not take longer than a few hours.  An integrated child seat is available.  I have one complaint with the controls; the dealer-installed cruise control is located on the steering column and is hidden from view.  

  Off the line, the acceleration of the Corolla is impressive and I found you can leave most non-performance vehicles in your dust.  The 1.8 liter 125 horsepower inline-four revs freely and even has a pleasant growl when pushed.  I became even more impressed with the car when I realized, despite my lead foot that the car averaged about thirty-three mpg in mixed driving and about thirty-eight on the highway.  Considering the present gas prices economy might be the most attractive attribute of the Corolla. 

   The Corolla handles well under every condition but it does not feel like a sports car either.  The cabin is quiet at highway speeds and the car rides very smoothly for a small car.  The five-speed manual transmission shifts smoothly and has very little play. Over all the Corolla feels solid and stable at high speeds.  The front disk and rear drum brakes bring the Corolla to a stop quickly and surely.  However, I do not understand why Toyota does not put standard anti-lock brakes on this car. 

  Like the Camry, the Corolla does everything well and a few things outstanding.  If it was not for the cabin room, you might think you are driving a Camry.  Add that to the Corolla's reputation for reliability and few cars in its price range remain as attractive.  Over all I'm very impressed; but if you stretch the tape measure out more than most people, or want a race car, look elsewhere otherwise this a great car.
