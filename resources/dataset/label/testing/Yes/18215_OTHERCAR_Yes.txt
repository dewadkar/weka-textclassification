            My integra was a great buy. I would recommend the car to anybody. I got a 98 integra ls for around $15,000 the smartest investment i have ever had. I bought the car for the value and the way it looks. I have had many comments on how the car looks, with the small additions that I have added to it. Such as an apex exhaust, which I would not recommend, as the sound is very low and unheard by other people which upsets me. I do not like the interior as it feels like you are in a family car, it doesn't have the sporty feel like a Honda Prelude. The other bad features in my opinion, is there is no trunk latch inside the car. So if your passenger needs to get something you have to instruct them on how to use a hidden latch to open the trunk. That becomes a nuisance at times. I think any middle age teenager to any fun loving adult should be interested in purchasing this car. Though for the older generation I think are more better suited for the Camry=)<br><br>
