            What a great improvement from my 1995 Dodge Avenger!!!  I was a little hesitant to purchase a sedan, but am so glad that I got this car!  I have even had many compliments on it because of it's sporty styling and roominess (inside).  I have had a few friends who highly recommended their Honda Accords and I am now one of them.
I have had this car for a little more than a year and have had no problems with it.  It has great gas mileage (I have the EX) of about 24 mi/gallon consistently.  Also, has a large gas tank which helps from visiting the gas station often.
I purchased this car in the fall of 1999 and recommend that if others are looking for a good deal (on a new car), buy it in the fall.  The dealerships usually still have a good stock of Accords and are trying to rid their inventory for the next year's models.  The dealership was very accommodating with buying back my car and giving me a great deal with some extras thrown in.  Yes, I had to settle for a model on the lot, but I had many choices. 
This car has been very reliable for a number of years and Honda has only improved upon this.
The acceleration is very good and quiet.  Even though it's a 4 cylinder, it has better pick up than my other V6.  The inside is very roomy and comfortable.  The rear seat folds down (60/40) which helps with storage.  The trunk is huge and holds a large amount.  The only problem I have is that the opening between the rear seat and trunk should be a bit larger.  I recently moved and this car was great and held a lot.
I'm about 5'7&quot; and this car fits very comfortable with my frame.  My boyfriend is 6'2&quot; and also has no problem in the front seat or with head room.
I definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a good, safe car, yet still has sporty styling.<br><br>
