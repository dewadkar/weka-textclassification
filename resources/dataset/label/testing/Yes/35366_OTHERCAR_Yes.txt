            <i>While this might not affect your decision to buy this car, I write this in memory of my first ever car, who was left unnamed, which has since been taken from me.  I miss you, car, and hope you are doing well in auto heaven.</i>  - Monkey

Ask anyone over the age of 16 what their first car was like and I guarantee you will see a tear start to form in the corner of their eye. It doesn�t matter what they drove, how bad it was (whether it actually worked) or how they got it, the first car you own is always your BEST car. Many a fond memory can be traced back to your car. It becomes a defining moment in your pre-adulthood life, marking the transition from �dependent peon� to �vehicular menace to society�. This transition is a grand and glorious moment. Allow me to share mine.

My first car, as you might have guessed, was a 1993 Navy Blue Eagle Talon Tsi. I loved that car. I remember every fond detail about it. I rue the day I was forced to give it up. A small altar sits in the darkest corner of my room in memory of that steel piece of glory that found its way into my life. It wasn�t just any car, it was <i>my</i> car.. my first car.  It was an extension of my manhood and was to be treated as such. If that car was a female, I would have indecent sexual relations with it (and inside it, but that comes later�)

So by now you are asking yourself: Why did I pick THIS car to be my gateway into adulthood instead of something else? What made this car so special?

<b>Specs</b>
Upon inspection of the Talon, it becomes clear why this was my car of choice. With it�s sub-$7000 price tag (at the time), it wasn�t a full-blown sports car, but the sleek exterior, manual transmission V6 and my liberal use of the gas pedal, it was still gutsy enough to leave those abuse-heaving geriatrics in their Grand Marquis eating my exhaust fumes. I was already sold at the thought of the enraged elderly folks, but now my parental units needed convincing as well. With 65,000 miles on it, the steering was still perfectly aligned, the accelerator was touchy, as were the brakes, the engine grunted like so many rednecks at a monster truck show and the transmission was smooth, even from 1st to 2nd gear. The test drive proved worthy and the car became mine. Victory! 

<b>Mods</b>
Considering the fact that I put an extra 20,000 miles on that car in the year that I had it, the repairs I had to make to it were moderate. I think I put around $2000 back into it to fix brake pads, suspension and various other odds and ends. My greatest expense was somewhat obscure.. a large amount of water found its way into the casing of my rear tail light, causing it not only to go out, but to rust and corrode all the wirings and plugs on the inside. About this time I began to notice that a vast majority of the parts in this car are customized (even the car battery), making it an arduous task to find them at a local store.  A mere inconvenience more than anything else. But it was my car, and I thought nothing of it.  

<b>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways�</b>
Ok, so I had to put a bit of cash into it to keep it running.. Ok, so the parts weren�t easy to find, but I still loved that damn car. The Talon is a date car. Date car? By this I mean that it is the perfect vehicle to take a significant other out on a date in.  It contains plenty of space in the two front seats, but becomes cramped with 3+ people in there. The two front seats do fold down all the way into the back, giving enough room for vigorous make out sessions. Thus this becomes the �Date Car�.  I will not elaborate on the experimentation that took place to figure this information out, needless to say that numerous test subjects were required.

Now we must examine the trunk space. Most semi-sports autos have very little trunk space, but not quite so with the talon. There is enough space to pack three dead bodies�errr.. full suitcases with space to spare. After some experimenting, my friends and I determined that it is possible to fit <b>9</b> people in (a result of much determination and constant bribing with Little Debbies cake rolls). Try pulling that off with your Corvette, Mr Mid-Life-Crisis. 

Now lets discuss the quirks. The Talon is smaller than the average car. Thus it fits into smaller places than most. This opens you up to a whole new realm of parking options, such as compact car spaces, school hallways, handicapped ramps and shopping malls. They are the field mice of automobiles. If the Talon won�t fit through it, its not worth getting into anyway.

Also notice that the car has a diverse electronic system. Considering it is a 1993 model, it has power steering, ABS brakes, power locks and various other buttons that do things ranging from opening your trunk and hood to promoting world peace and auto-firing the rear mounted chaingun (a personally added modification). Very cool. So many buttons, so little time.

<b>VH1�s Where is it Now?</b>
So why did I give up my monstrous machine? What bizarre twist of fate caused this mechanized love-making road warrior to be torn from my possession. One word: College. College is evil. Tution ended up kicking my behind so I had to bid farewell to my other love of my life. I was happy to find that the market price was very stable (I actually made a 500 profit on resale), so I got most of my money back.. or I would have if I hadn�t sold it through a private seller. But that was my mistake. This event happened just over 12 months ago.

Then the proverbial caca hit the fan. My worst nightmare became reality. While back on vacation from college during my first year, I was driving round in my friends car to see the wreckage of a blue-wheeled motor stud splattered all over the road. Oh no.. My pulse began racing. I panicked. What was this that stood before me? Could someone possibly be so careless? The answer was a painful yes. The new owner of my vehicle had decided to play chicken with an SUV.. and lost miserably.  The damage was irreparable.  No longer was this car a mighty phallic symbol, but more the fine point on the end of a thumb tack.. just a little prick. My car was dead. I wept.


<b>Final Thought of the Day</b>
I really cannot make an unbiased decision about this car, suffice to say that I loved this vehicle very much. It had the sentimental value of my first love (actually more value considering who my first love was..) It is the poor mans speed demon, the moving one-night-stand, ol� faithful.. and most of all.. My first automobile.
