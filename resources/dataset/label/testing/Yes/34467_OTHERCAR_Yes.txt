            My bullet is the best gas economizer. Imagine while gas prices are soaring my bullet needs very little gas to go the distance - that's why I purchased this vehicle. Although I have a '96 it is still performing at it's  best.
 It is nice driving through a crowded street and zipping pass other vehicles that I call spaceships, my bullet just squeezes by.
 The fold down back seats are also an advantage when I make purchases that need more room, because my trunk space is already occupied. My front seats are also handy when I go out with my husband, and I am tired, I just drop back on the passenger side while he is driving and get a little nap in before we get to our destination.
 If I forget to pull out the antenna before I begin driving, all I have to do is open my window and pull it out while I am driving.
 I highly recommend this car to people who are tired of those high prices at the pump, and live on a tight budget. <br><br>
