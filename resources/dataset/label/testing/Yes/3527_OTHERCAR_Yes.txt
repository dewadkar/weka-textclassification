            I'd been wanting a digital camera for quite awhile, and had been considering some different ones.  After considering what I wanted in a camera, reading reviews, and talking to the employees at Best Buy about all the ones that were within my price range, I decided on the HP PhotoSmart 315.  So far I've been very happy with that decision.

This is the first digital camera I've ever used, and I found it very simple to figure out.  It doesn't have a lot of "fancy" features, but that wasn't really important to me.  It has 3 resolutions - Basic, Fine, and SuperFine.  Basic is great for pictures you want to e-mail to someone or post on a website.  Fine is good for printing, as I recently discovered - I ordered prints of some of my digital pictures from Shutterfly and they turned out much better than I expected them to!  The color isn't quite as bright or accurate as it would be with a regular film camera, but it's good enough. :)  I've never used the SuperFine resolution so I can't really comment on it.

The camera comes with an 8MB CompactFlash card.  It holds enough pictures for my normal use - about 80 on Basic resolution and about 20 on Fine - but I did buy a 32MB one because I'm going on vacation soon and wanted to be sure I could take plenty of pictures, since I won't have access to my computer to "empty" the card until I get home again.

It comes with a USB cable you can hook up to your computer to upload the pictures from the camera.  This uses up quite a bit of battery power, though, so I'd recommend getting some kind of card reader to use instead to help conserve your batteries.  Speaking of the battery power, I also definitely recommend getting rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise you may end up spending a LOT of money on batteries. :)

Another drawback (besides the batteries) to the PhotoSmart 315 is the 2.5X digital zoom.  If you use the zoom, it lowers the quality of your picture.  Optical zoom would be better than digital.  Other than that, though, I have no complaints!
