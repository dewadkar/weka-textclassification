            Overall, for the first few weeks, we think the Cross Country All Wheel Drive model is great. This is our first Volvo. We traded in a Jeep Grand Cherokee (1994 with 77,000). My wife wanted a smaller vehicle but we didn't want to give up all the benefits of the SUV. The Volvo V70 XC is the perfect compromise -- roomy storage area, with collapsible seats, roof racks, higher off the ground (than the regular V70 wagon), all wheel drive (good for getting out of sand here in Florida) and enough power in the engine to haul things. 

Things to watch out for: You will be making a trade-off in gas mileage for the added weight of the safety features (about 16.2 so far). Also, the car comes with lengthwise roof bars but not the horizontal ones (by from the parts department for slightly over $200. With the cross bars, it can carry over 200 pounds on the roof. Our dealer carries all XC models with sunroofs (we didn't want one but had no choice). <br><br>
