             After spending too much time at the scanner with (polaroids)and numerous 35 MM pictures . I wanted to find a camera that was versatile and still easy to use . Also with the ability to make good quality pictures and yet be able to load into computer for modification and easy enhancement.
 I chose the Mavica because its large view screen , instantly your able to review your photos ,and delete those that were not quite what you expected , the Mavica also has photo type options not available on all
digital cameras. you can change to black and white mode or even take in negative mode for a variety of pictures types . the (mpeg) movie recorder and player is an added treat for viewing short movies you make and send in emails. 
 The Mavica also uses standard 3.5 floppy discs , which once you've 
loaded into your computer you're able to reuse the floppy . Big savings all around no more film , no more wasted photos that go right into the
trash because of over/underexposure ! The price of this camera is well justified in the money you save , and the ease of use ,most importantly is the options that the Mavica offers . Extremely good product!<br><br>
