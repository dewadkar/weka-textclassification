            Update!  80,000 miles have rolled up on the odometer, and I'm as happy as ever with this great truck.  No breakdowns, squeaks or rattles, and routine maintenance has been limited to oil and filters.  Fuel mileage is still superb; I averaged 23 m.p.g. on a recent 2000 mile trip averaging over 70 miles per hour.  Sadly, it's for sale, which breaks my heart, but I need something with a bigger back seat.  For the kids! I sure am gonna miss this rig...


     50,000 miles, and no complaints yet.  As far as I'm concerned, that's as good as it gets.  I purchased a '97 F-150 Supercab Flareside in late 1996, and have really enjoyed it.  A note...my truck is equipped with the 4.2 liter V-6, since I don't do any towing and loads hauled are fairly small.  I use it to go to work about three days a week, and this engine and the 5-speed manual tranmission really make it easy on gas, about 20 mpg since new.  In a Ford truck, fuel mileage suffers big time if you drive them fast, so I take it easy on this rig, and it's really paid off.  My best tank covered nearly 600 miles at over 24 mpg -- but it was boring and I had to take two restroom breaks!
     Reliability has been very good.  Two or three trips to the dealer for a recall, and a wheel sensor for the ABS that failed twice.  Ford rerouted the exhaust pipe to exit behind the real wheel at no cost, a modification I highly recommend.  It's quieter now, and the right rear wheel stays much cleaner.
     Comfort is excellent.  This is a very nice long distance cruiser, especially with the factory 6-disc CD player and the supportive seats.  It's quiet inside, and the controls are logically placed.
     Performance is...good.  The V-6 has its drawbacks, and one of them is passing power.  The horsepower and torque are there, you just have to be willing to spin the motor towards the high end of the tachometer to get them!  Highway passing requires 4th gear, and merging onto the freeway almost demands shifts at 3000 rpm.  But, overall, acceleration is just fine for a 4500 lb. rig.  The other drawback is towing capacity.  Personally, I wouldn't tow anything with this motor/trans combo, and I think Ford feels the same way.
     I've really enjoyed this rig, and will likely keep it for a long time.  It's a good looking, hard working truck.  And the wife likes it, so I guess we'll keep it!
