            I love the sleek sporty look of this newer cavalier compared to 10 years ago when it was so boxy-looking.  My first was a 1987 and was the best car I owned for 9 years (until I bought my '96).  Only reason I bought a new one is because the '87 was rusted out, which is because I didn't always have a garage in these Minnesota winters.  But, even sitting out in sometimes 20-below zero weather it always started.  

When it was time to go car shopping again, I did a lot of comparison shopping, mostly with the Dodge Neon (which is too tinny for my tastes).  I do mean 'tinny and not tiny, as the doors on the Neon felt very light-weight in comparison to the Cavalier.   

Also, looked at the Saturn but felt too cramped in that car.  

So, I went to the Chevy dealer where I had purchased my original one and thought, what the heck, can always just take it for a test drive, and that's when I knew it was for me.  I was immediately comfortable in it and loved the look.  For a reasonable price and a nice sporty look, I feel pretty safe in this car as it has good wheel suspension.  

I recommend a 5-speed (which is what I have), peppier than an automatic.  It's low and close to the road so it hugs the road and corners beautifully, without fear of rolling.  It has a great am/fm stereo cassette radio, air-conditioning, power locks, cruise, tilt, the works.  It is just a 2.0 liter engine, and I get excellent gas mileage.  The heater is much better than my old one, has more umph...

As far as noise, there is none.  You can carry on a conversation without hearing the roar of the engine while driving.  While it's certainly no cadillac, it is relatively quiet.  

I always take it in for regular maintenance and keep it washed and polished.  Almost 4 years later it looks as great as when I drove it home from the showroom, so I highly recommend it for dependability.  It's a good dependable car, while you don't have to spend a fortune.
