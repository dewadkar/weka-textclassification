                 My husband and I bought a Saturn SL2 right before we got married in 1994 and we still have it.  We highly recommend this car to all of our friends and a few of them have even bought one for themselves.  It is a highly reliable car and we have only had to do routine maintenance on the car.
     When we first started looking at new cars we loved the friendly unpressured sales staff at the Saturn dealership.  They told us what we all about the car and then left us alone to check the car out.  They weren't constantly looking over our shoulder.  
     We love the spacious cargo space, the comfortable seats, and just about everything else.  The car is a dream to drive and is very easy to handle.  I would recommend this car to any one who is looking  for a little more space than a compact car and is in need of a very reliable car.  <br><br>
