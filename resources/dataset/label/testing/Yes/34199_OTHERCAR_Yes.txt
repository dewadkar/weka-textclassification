            <b>OVERVIEW</b>
The <b>Sony DSC-P9</b> (featuring 4 megapixel images) is a fantastic little digital camera.  The size and ergonomics of the camera make it easy to hold, transport and shoot.  I am not a photography expert, but I am an absolutely avid photographer of my family and friends.  Using this camera almost daily, I have come to know the advantages and disadvantages of this product and I am happy to share them with you.  Overall, I have found it to be a very reliable, user-friendly camera.  Though I'd make a few improvements on this model (which I understand that they have in the newer generation, the DSC-P10) I would recommend it.  


<b>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</b>
It's a little smaller than the size of a standard chalkboard eraser, with the trigger button conveniently located on the top right corner.  

The front face of the camera (almost completely flat when the camera is collapsed) features a flash, view-finding window, a very small auto-focus bulb behind glass and a 3x optical plus 2x digital (6x total) autofocus zoom lens.  The 4-megapixel sensor captures 2,272 x 1,704 images which allows for prints that range in size up to 11 x 14 inches.

The power button is located on the top of the camera, just beside the "trigger".  This power button also opens and closes the lens, which definitely helps to protect the camera.  Around the trigger is a rotating disc which allows the user to select the mode of use: scenery photo-shooting (special lighting effects), standard digital photo-shooting, playback, digital movie shooting, and set up.  

The rear panel of the camera features a rather large digital display screen (LCD) of the image you are about to capture.  It also feautres the rear of the standard view-finding window.  In the upper right-hand corner, are the zoom buttons that control the lens on the camera.  They work easily and offer just enough zoom capability for amatuer photography.    The back panel also features a MENU button and controls for the flash, scrolling options for the photo previews, and an LCD on/off button. Honestly, the controls are simple, streamlined and not-overwhelming to an average user.  I really like this.  At the bottom of the back panel is a removable panel that reveals slots for the AC adapter and the cable to dowload images to your computer.  This panel is a bit flimsy and seems to pop off is a weird, awkward way.  It has, however, stayed in tact for the year or so that we've owned this camera.  

Speaking of cables, the camera did come with both the AC cable as well as a USB cable, which allows the download of the files to your computer.  It also came with a 16MB memory stick (about 15 pictures at defaut settings), which is not sufficient for the average user's needs.  We actually purased a larger memory stick right off the bat and we still find that we woulld prefer more memory for vacations, etc.  Also the camera uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.  (Battery life is dependent up one of the LCD panel, flash usage, video captures, etc. but does offer several hours of run time on average without recharging.  If unused the camera will automatically shut itself off, which contributes to the saving of battery life.)

Suprisingly, this Sony product DID NOT come with a carrying case.  We had to purchase one separately, which was a bit inconvenient.  


<b>IMAGE QUALITY</b>
* Most pictures I've taken with this camera have been of good or great quality.  The pictures I've taken in natural light have been exceptional, while some of the indoor pictures without flash can be fuzzy or to dark at times, but I'm willing to accept that the problem is me. :)  Overall, I have very good things to say about the image quality but the following points are areas for improvement.
* The flash, while powerful, seems a bit too intense at times.  When we try to use the flash, faces look overexposed and the scenery looks unnatural.  To correct this problem, we manually adjusted the intensity of the flash in the menu options.  
* The video quality is surpsingly good for a digital camera, not intended to be a video camera.  You cannot zoom the video, however.  The lighting of your video footage must be either natural or exceptionally bright for the footage to be regarded as good-quality, however.  
* It's very difficult to take clear close-up shots.  For some reason, the camera cannot process extreme close-ups very well.  When would this be a problem?  Well, I wanted to take close-ups of my infant's toes and ears...I found this to be nearly impossible.
* A SUGGESTION: Try not to move the camera much when clicking the trigger button.  THis will help you to get a clear image more consistently.  I have found that this skill improves with experience!


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
I would definitely buy another Sony digital camera.  Despite the areas of improvement that I've mentioned, this camera has been so great for my family.  As mentioned earlier, we use this camera almost daily and I am pleased to say that it has helped us to capture some of our fondest family memories both is photo and video media.
