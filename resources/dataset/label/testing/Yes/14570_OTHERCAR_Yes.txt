             Last summer, when I was looking for a camera, to record pictures for a hydroplane racing event, I spent some time researching, looking for a camera that would suit my needs.
 I needed a camera that would record to a floppy because my computer uses a serial mouse, and I have only one serial port. I could have gotten a camera that records to a &quot;smart-card,&quot; but that requires an adapter that costs another $90.
 By eliminating cameras that don't use floppies, the field was narrowed down to two or three brands, Sony being the one that cost the least..Perfect!
 A quick search found that I could get the camera from my local Staples Supply. Now here's the good part, they had only one of these models in stock, and it was being used for display. So, after a little negotiating, I was able to get a 10% discount off the retail price, which was a better deal than I was able to find on the net.
 With a little practice, the camera is easy to use and gives beautiful results. I was able to post pictures, almost in real time, on the internet, from all over the race site.<br><br>
