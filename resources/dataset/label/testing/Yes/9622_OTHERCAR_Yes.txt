            Just bought the Sony Cyber-Shot DCS-P52 digital camera. As this represents my first foray into the digital era of photo-taking, I did a great deal of research, read a number of reviews, and intentionally started small - with an entry-level model.

After a month using the P52, the quick review is this: it's a solid performer, from a manufacturer I trust, and has proven up to the task for which I've intended it.

<b> Specs / Features </b>

Pretty basic stuff here: 

3.1 megapixels
2X optical zoom
3x digital zoom

limited mpeg capability

16 meg memory stick

Sony picture software

2 Double A batteries


I would have liked to get more optical zoom for my money - some competitors' models in the same price range offer 3x, for example, but I traded that for other considerations with the Sony.

I realize that all of these come with a 16 meg memory card/stick, but it's essentially useless if you want to store any pictures at all, so as does everyone else - I sprung for a separate 128 meg stick for an extra $50, and have been downloading to cd once I've filled it with photos I want to keep.

The 'movie' capability is a nice feature for taking short videos, but good luck trying it at night, as it doesn't seem to work with the flash.  Perhaps that's something I haven't yet figures out - if so I'll come back and update later.

<b> Usability </b>

As I said, I was a complete novice when I bought this camera, so this was a good test of its ease of use. I'll guess that I spent about an hour or so reading through the manual and familiarizing myself with the features.

All in all, it was fairly intuitive - navigating among the various features is not too difficult, and I figured out pretty quickly how to review photos I'd already taken, zoom in on them, delete any, etc. 


<b> Battery Life </b>

This was an area of concern with these cameras overall when I began to research - many models received poor reviews, and I didn't want to be stuck with a dead camera in the middle of an outing. This seemed to be an area of relative strength for the P52, so I was willing to trade a bit on optical zoom to get the strong battery life. To date they've been fine - strong enough to get me through a day's worth of picture taking, as long as I don't use the movie feature too much.


<b> Photo Quality </b>

The photo quality has been adequate - not great, not as bad as I've seen on others.  I generally am only printing 4x6 sized photos, and don't have a need to blow up pictures to any size larger than that.

I do notice some occasional blurriness when I've zoomed in to the camera's limit, but that may well be a limitation of the printing, though I've been using Kodak paper, and have a serviceable Dell printer.  I'll have to fool around a bit more with the printing, and will be slightly disappointed if it turns out that this is a camera limitation rather than a printing one.

<b> Software </b>

I've spent some time playing with the software Sony provided, and have also used the Dell Photo software that came with my PC. So far, the Dell version is clearly superior both in terms of usability and capability.
I will spend more time looking at the Sony software to fully explore its capabilities, but may find myself abandoning it completely if the Dell advantage holds up.

<b> Conclusion </b>

Not great - there are certainly better models available, and as we've seen over the past few months, as new models come out, prices will drop on the existing ones. Sony offers two higher models of this camera - the P72 and P92, which address some of the P52's limitations (e.g. more optical zoom).

For its price, however (around $210), and given my own basic needs, I'm satisfied with its performance. For the casual amateur I would recommend this model, but the more serious photographer will want to look elsewhere.
