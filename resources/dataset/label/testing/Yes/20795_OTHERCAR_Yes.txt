            Since 1995, I've been the proud owner of a 1989 1/2 Burgundy Int./Ext. Fleetwood with gold trim outside and real wood trim inside. It is truly a beautiful car. The ride is super-smooth and the seats are incredibly comfortable. Literally, this car feels like riding on a cloud. It's like a living room on wheels. 

Unlike the current Cadillacs, this car is extremely spacious with tons of rear leg room, and it even has two lighted vanity mirrors in the back! Contrary to what some people say, the gas mileage is surprisingly good for a car this size. The on-board computer claims 18-19 mpg. I'd estimate it's about 15 mpg. 

One minor drawback is the existence of some cabin noise especially on the highway. One would expect a quieter experience similar to the Lexus or Town Car. The only major drawback with a car of this type and age is that repairs are not as rare as I'd like, and until I can find a reliable shop, the dealership I've been taking it to charges an arm and a leg. Over the past 2 yrs., however, the reliability has been decent compared to my first few yrs. of ownership. 

Overall, if you're looking for a smooth ride, old-fashioned roominess and that Cadillac name and style, then this is the car for you.
