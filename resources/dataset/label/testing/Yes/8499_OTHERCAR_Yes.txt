            I did a lot of research on the Internet before committing to buying a digital camera. This was a major purchase for me! I read about the FinePix 2600 before it was available on the market, and the price and range of features made it very appealing to me. In the meantime, I checked out other brands and models, but none compared to what I could get with this model. I was planning to attend a music festival at the beginning of November and wanted to take the camera with me, so I decided to take a risk and buy it on the Internet as soon as it became available. And I have not regretted that decision one bit! People have remarked about how incredible the image quality is, and several people have become interested in going digital after seeing my photos. I think that says a lot about this camera!

The camera is easy to use and set up. The accompanying software makes it easy to view, e-mail, or save your pictures on disk. I especially love the optical zoom this camera offers--it's rare to find a digital camera in this price range that offers 3x optical and 2x digital zoom. I was able to take very clear pictures from pretty far away. Another plus was the 16 MB Smart Media; most cameras in this price range come with only 8 MB. I went ahead and bought a 64 MB Smart Media for the festival, as I knew I would be taking lots of pictures. I took 127 shots and still had over 80 left! I'm not sure exactly how many you can get with the 16 MB, as I haven't used that one.

The only (minor) problems I have had are with the viewfinder and the flash. If you use the LCD display, the viewfinder is not an issue. But if you are taking pictures in poor lighting, the LCD display doesn't help. The viewfinder is very small and difficult to find--I had to ask several people to "hold on a minute!" to find it! Also, there are many flash options that took me a while to play around with until I got it right, but that's probably just because I'm used to automatic flash. There are two flash options that are great for low-light conditions, but the camera and the subject must both be almost completely still in order to avoid "camera shake" (a symbol on the LCD display warns you of camera shake conditions). It is recommended to use a tripod for shots using these flash settings; for me, that was not possible. I got some not so good shots using these settings, but I was trying to take shots from far away. The shots I took on the regular flash setting up close turned out much better. You may just have to play around with it a little like I did to find out what works best in your particular conditions.
