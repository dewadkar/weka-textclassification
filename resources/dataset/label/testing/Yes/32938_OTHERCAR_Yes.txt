            It has been over 2 years since we've bought this van, so I just wanted to update our experience.  We now have over 61,000 trouble free miles on our van.  It is still a pleasure to drive, and comfortable to ride in.  We are glad we went with the captains chairs in the middle row.  This allows another couple to ride with us in the same comfort the front row has.  It can also separate siblings!  Our MPG averages around 20.1 MPG.  Other than our initial problems with the latches and taking it in for regular maintenance, we've not needed any service.  We are still completely happy with our purchase.

Original Review:
We bought a fully loaded Dodge Caravan ES in July 2001.  After 6 months, we are still delighted with our purchase.  (Should our opinion ever change, I will certainly update my comments here.)  

Even though we are a small family of 3, we travel extensively by car.  We have often felt like sardines, packed tightly into our small, 4-door, Nissan as we went about the country.  To give us more room, our thoughts turned to the Caravans.  However, after owning two Nissan vehicles that had gone 200,000+ miles with very little problem, we were a little apprehensive about the reliability of the Caravans.  We were reassured by testimonials by a number of owners who got 250,000+ miles out their Caravans and went ahead with our purchase. 

We wanted some specific options.  As we started looking at dealerships, we found that the options we felt were necessary generally came on higher end cars--which came with a number of other options/features that we probably would not have chosen if we had created our vehicle from scratch.  However, we are glad we have some of them.  

Among the features that we would recommend are the power liftgate and power sliding doors (both sides).  The power doors allow my small child to open the doors and get in by herself and is convenient when loading and unloading.  The power liftgate is also especially handy for short folks like us, who find it a bit of a reach to close the liftgate manually.  The power doors/liftgate are particularly handy when traveling through incliment weather and the car is muddy and/or dirty--you can open and close the liftgate or doors without touching them.  Another option we like is the steering wheel mounted audio controls.  With these buttons, you can control all of your radio/CD funtions without reaching over to the control panel.  This keeps your eyes on the road where they belong :-)  Another feature that we have liked is the removable center console.  This comes with a lock, and also includes space (and power) for a cell phone.  This console comes installed between the front seats, however, if your second row is captains chairs, you can also move it between those seats (or buy a second one).  One of our favorite options is the trip computer--this shows various bits of information like your MPG, miles to empty, engine time, and another odometer (which we use for tracking miles on trips while we use the trip odometer to track miles between fill-ups).  It also has a compass (sometimes a necessity) and a temperature (which is interesting).

The ride is relatively quiet, and the engine has good get up and go.  We've used the cruise control through somewhat hilly terrain and found that even when climbing hills, that speed was maintained without kicking off cruise.  It is an adjustment for us to drive a larger vehicle, however, the Grand Caravan drives quite nimbly and doesn't feel like a road hog--even when making u-turns or parking.  

The interior is roomy and the seating is comfortable.  Throughout the car are power jacks and cupholders.  The interior lights come on automatically when you open the doors and gradually fade.  The headlights also stay on for a short time after you turn them off so you have light while you get out.  The seatbelts are adjustable which means that a short person will not have the belt riding across their neck.  They also allow you to move and reach a little without constricting.  While the seats are heavy, nevertheless they are easy to remove and replace.  The captains chair easily tips forward to give access to the back seat.  The back bench seat is split which allows you to take out half or all of the back seat.  You can also remove the captains chairs and move the bench seat to the middle position if you choose.  The seats come with the LATCH anchors built into the seats.  These anchors allow you to install LATCH carseats into the car without messing with seatbelts.  

We only have a few complaints about our vehicle so far.  We have had a few bugs with the latches on the power doors.  We've had one replaced, and need to have the other replaced (the door jams when opening).  We generally get about 19.8 MPG highway, a few tenths below that for city, which we feel is kind of low.  In the front seat, if you are using the cupholders, you block the CD player (we have the optional 4CD stereo), which is a bit of a hassle.  You have to load the CDs before you put a drink in the holder.

We can't say enough about our Grand Caravan.  We've driven in its toughest competition, the Honda Oddessy, for comparison. While the Honda may be number 1 in safety, the ride and comfort just does not compare with that of the Grand Caravan.  I found the seatbelts in the Honda to be tight and uncomfortable and the interior felt cramped and awkward.  For comfort and fun, I think the Caravan wins hands down.
