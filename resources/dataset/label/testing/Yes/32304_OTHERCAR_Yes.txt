            We Love our brand New Nissan Sentra. It gets great Gas mileage. The Engine is So quite,You can't even tell if it is running or not.
The Major problem is that the Cruise Control broke during the first week that we got it. We got it repaired at the dealership, it is still under the original factory warranty, but it only works about half of the time that I try to use it.The have offered to repair it again. My favorite feature of this car is  the rear window defog. It works so fast.I consider it a great safety feature. There is plenty enough room for a full Size car seat in the back seat, which was the deciding factor, in purchasing our new car.<br><br>
