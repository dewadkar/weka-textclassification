            It is a great feeling when driving the food explorer.  We leased a 1998 XLS Explorer and love it.  I feel very secure when driving the Ford Explorer.  It has a good pick up, not bad on gas and has a smooth ride.  I drive the explorer back and forth to work.  It is great not to worry when the whether is raining or snowing.  Just get in and go.  My husband, on the other hand, uses it for recreational purposes on the weekend.  He is a hunter.  The cargo space is big to hold his camping, fishing and hunting equipment.  The roof racks are sturdy for extra luggage room. 

We would recommend this vehicle for anyone who has children, takes long rides and enjoys the outdoors.
