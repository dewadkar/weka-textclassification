             The new JAGUAR X TYPE is art plain and simple. Everyone wants to see this car. The style  and class of this car it is one of the best around. You will stand out any where you go.

 I test drove the sport model only to find out the seat is higher and my head hit the roof. After the dealer told me to try the basic model i was impressed. No head room problems anymore.

  The price i paid was a little over $36,000 and i did not go with all the options. You can get global positioning and 5 disk changer and cell phone. I did not get any of the above or the $2,000 sports package because of the head room problem. I did get the full leather in a tan and birds eye maple dash and steering wheel. This wheel alone  is over $900. If you see it you will understand why i paid that much. The interior is perfect as you expect from jaguar. 

 Handling is tight and firm not sports car firm but you know this car is capable. They come with all wheel drive and all season tires. Some people complain about tire noise not much but a hint of it. This can be stopped with new tires. Acceleration is good for such a small motor and heavy car. This car is over 3,500 pounds. I have the 4 speed auto and it has a wide range gear selection that gets this car moving good.

  Mileage is better than expected in the 20 mile per gallon range city and highway depends on your left foot of course.
Power is smooth and linear. Nice throaty exhaust sound. Remember this is really a sports car with style not a pure bred no frills racer.
 
 The body fit and seams are almost perfect. The interior is a work of art. the sports model was not as nice with a black birds eye maple dash and black interior. This is like the BMW and MERCEDES they have no real style all black. The tan interior with maple dash and the steering wheel are a work of art. You must see  what a jaguar is know for and this is it. Just like rolls royce and bentley the interior is nothing but the best in terms of style. 

 All instruments and controls are european style. This means manual gauges no digital and adjustments on steering wheel tilt are controled by a locking lever. This car has a built in alarm system and one of the most unusual keys you will see. This is part of the security system it has a micro chip so no one can steal this car.The stereo is digital and so is GPS SYSTEM. Climate control does a fine job  but fan is noisy at full level. You will never need the fan at full level in most cases and it is quite at normal levels. The stereo has perfect sound and good controls. Takes some getting used to many options. One cup holder but be happy you get one. The jaguar engineers did not even want to put that one in. They believe this car is for driving not eating in. You must remember over in europe some countries fine you for eating and drinking in a car. Boy we would make money on all the tickets over here in the usa.

  Ride and braking are well done for how heavy this car is. A little tire noise but this is because of the all season tires now used. This car has all wheel drive and is made for winter use. Seats are well done all the options you would expect even heated. trunk space large compared to other cars. Remember one thing if a light says boot is open it the trunk.
  

  My opinion on this car is very simple i love it period. The price is high for each option  and the interior is small. No real back seat you can get 2 people in but not much room. The width of the car is smaller than american cars  except compacts but this is a sports car. The interior is not smaller than most BMWS or MERCEDES. If you ever owned one of the 2 cars  you know eurpoean cars are smaller than American cars.

  The cost is lower than other JAGUARS before It. This is a low cost way to get the driving experience of one of the best cars on the road. Quality is very high and dealer response is over done. They send me letters every few weeks asking how i like the car and if they can do anything for me. Free oil changes every 10,000 miles. You pay for one and they pay for the next one. 100,000 mile warranty and a free loaner every time you take the car in for service.

  Is this the car for you. Take a look at one and test drive it. It is one of the best looking cars on the road today. This will get attention if  you want it. We all want to be noticed and this car will do that for you. This is a fine car in all aspects and most people will be more than happy with it.
