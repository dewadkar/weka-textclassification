            They Sony Mavica CD-400 is a great leap in digital cameras.  It really is the first camera of its time to incorporate professional features such as a hot shoe flash and a hologram auto-focus.

By using the built-in CD burner, it can hold way more than a conventional memory card, and can store movies that are longer than a typical digital camera.  As an inspiring photographer, who loves to work with video as well, I have really enjoyed my experience with this camera.  Even though it looks large, the camera is really very light, and the lithium batteries will carry a charge for up to 140 minutes.

The only drawback to this camera, however, is the classical complicated Sony navigational system and the poorly designed symbols on the camera.  I am technically inclined, and can use the camera easily.  My family, on the other hand, who are not very technically inclined, can take good basic pictures, but have trouble using the advanced functions of the camera.

Going back, the CD space is really amazing.  At a poster size resolution with 5 seconds of audio per picture, I can fit up to 123 pictures on a CD!  At a regular picture resolution with no audio, I can get 135.  This is truly amazing for a digital camera at a 4 Mega Pixel resolution.

Overall, this is a great camera if you are looking for something with a little more quality than the regular cameras, and a lot more space.
