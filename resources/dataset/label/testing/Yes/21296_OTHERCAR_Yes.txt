            My Sweet 16 Car.  Ah, the memories.  Being a new driver, I wasn't exactly gentle with it.  I floored the thing more often than not.  Ran into a couple cement poles.  Let the garage close on it.  Ran into some cabinets.  Backed into a few cars.  Wore the breaks to nubs.  Used the A/C with the windows open.  Blasted the CD player to ear-splitting decibals.  Drove it like a maniac . . . Basically treated the thing like any other teenager would.  

I had a '92 Camry XLE.  While shell, leather interior.  Moonroof, CD-player.  What a babe.  I owned the car from 92 to 99, and when I recently moved to New York City (no need for a car in the public transportation capital of the states) I sold it.  Sad as it was to let go of teenage memories, I wasn't too unhappy at the money I got.  I sold that puppy for $10,000 big ones!  Woo hoo!  (And I could have gotten more, if I weren't selling it to a good friend of mine.)  Furnished my apartment with that right there, folks.

So what's the lesson here?  Great car.  Great car.  I never had a problem with it. It never needed major servicing.  Never broke down on me.  Rides like a dream, AND, most important of all, the depreciation is incredible.  How many people can say they've sold a car from '92 for that much money?  Would I recommend this car?  What do you think?<br><br>
