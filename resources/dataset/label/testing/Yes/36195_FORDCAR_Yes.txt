            THIS IS THE BEST ECONOMY CAR!!!!!!!  I LOVE this little car!!!!  It may not be the best looking car in the world but it grows on you.  It drives with the composure of a long distance runner.  It rides like the best luxury car on the market.  It is as quick as sports cars that cost thousands more.  It has the quality that you would expect from the maker Ford, it actually sorta makes the Toyotas and Hondas look bad in my opinion.  The Focus has lots of storage room and space.  It is as comfortable as they come.  I have to say that when Ford designed this car they done an excellent job.  They hit the target dead center.  This is a car Ford should be VERY, VERY, VERY proud of.  I would tell anyone that they need to buy this car.  So far my wife has had NO problems with hers, and since I got mine 4 of my neighbors have gotten one.  And you get an added bonus with this car.  You know how Ferrari's and Porches and other fancy sports cars get all of those stares and grins cause they are so neat, well you get that with this little car.  Everywhere you go everyone looks and loves the car.  I mean it is Double-Decker Quarter-Pounder EXTRA LARGE meal at a Happy Meal price.  ENJOY!!!!!!!<br><br>
