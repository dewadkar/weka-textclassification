            This camera was bought after months of researching for Digital camera products, and I must say this has it all. The best way to explain the DSC-S50 is that it's a stripped-down camcorder. You have the LCD viewfinder that is on a swivel base (excellent thought on Sony's part), a small 15 second MPEG movie mode, and menu systems are driven by a simple controller. If you have used a Sony camcorder from the past few years, the menu system and picture effects will be very similar to those found on this camera. 

I decided to spend the extra $100 over the DSC-S30 purely for the movie feature, and decided to save $200 by not buying the DSC-S70 so that I can buy some extra accessories. The InfoLithium battery lastst much longer than most batteries I have seen, and the time left counter helps determine if it needs a recharge. The bad parts about this camera are small details, but important ones. The 4MB Memory Stick that comes supplied will not hold many high-quality photos or MPEG movies. Buying a 32MB stick is probably the safest upgrade (costs about $79), and it holds about 70-80 pictures at 1024x768 resolution. Another problem is no physical viewfinder, so the only method of aiming the camera is through the LCD screen. Indoors it works well, but on sunny days you might have problems seeing the screen outdoors. 

One other small detail that hurts this camera is the USB interface. Personally I ended up buying the Floppy Disk Adaptor (another $79) but now I can carry pictures around on my laptop and onto other computers as long as the software is installed. Overall though, once you get the hang of these small quirks (whether you kick up the money or not) you will have a fun product that is easy to pick up and go.

Thought it would be good to do an update after owning it for a year. Had to get mine repaired after dropping it on the lens side of the camera - instantly $230 repair. I recommend getting a case for it no matter how cheap it is. Also, after learning some of the features (or buying the 37mm lens add-ons) you can take some incredible pictures... especially with the timed exposure modes. I'm a little upset it is bulky at times (I want to be able to carry it in my pocket when I go out), but smaller models usually have cheaper lenses. Keep that in mind when shopping for the newer Sony models - the lens can make a big difference.
