            I first test drove one last summer, after test-driving a Nissan Xterra, and was surprised that the Matrix was roomier, especially in the back seat.  I'd also driven a PT Cruiser and was more impressed with the Matrix.  Started looking at them again after Christmas and decided on the Indigo Ink Pearl XR model.  I was satisfied with the price - didn't feel as though it was too much money.  Except for a front bumper/spoiler scrape on a concrete block which ended up costing $800.00 to repair, I am thoroughly pleased with this great little car.  Now I just don't pull up quite so far!  It brings lots of compliments from people of all ages. Our 13-year old son gets a kick out of having a car that people notice!  The only improvements I would suggest are:  raise the front bumper/spoiler a bit; put extenders on the sun visors; add arm rests; and upgrade the seats in the XR model.  I plan to have this car a long, long time.
