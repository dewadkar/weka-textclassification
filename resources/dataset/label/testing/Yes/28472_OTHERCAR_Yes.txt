            After years of drooling each time I would see a Volvo, I finally realized I was making enough money to afford one of my own. I'd told myself *if* I ever got to be a professor, I'd drive a Volvo. As fate would have it, one lead to the other.

I recently purchased a 2000 Volvo V40 and absolutely adore it! I have driven SUV's for years, but as of late, became increasingly concerned with their safety and not to mention the gas consumption. So, changing over to the V40 was like getting the best of both worlds...plenty of room to haul my gear, safety features and great gas mileage.

My V40 is totally a base model, with no option packages. BUT, this is still by far the nicest car I have ever owned. What Volvo considers &quot;base&quot; other car manufacturers would charge you extra for I'm sure. 

I've found that my V40 is very spirited and accelerates nicely with no &quot;lugging&quot; whatsoever. The car has great speed and control, with little body roll in turns. Parking is also easy.

My V40 has the standard 1.9 litre 4 cyl. engine which is also tagged as a &quot;Turbo.&quot; The car gets a jolt of low end torque while still in very low rpms, under 3,000 to be exact. This is what helps it bolt out from behind a semi on the interstate and breeze by it with seemingly little effort. Gas mileage as of late is about 28 miles per gallon, which I consider quite good.

One other interesting thing...on my particular V40, at speeds around 85 mph (yes, I have been known to speed) there is a warning tone that sounds. This gave me a real fright the first time it ever happened. I was charging along the interstate and all of a sudden, this very audible &quot;beep&quot; sounded. Of course, not knowing what it was, slowed down and started looking at my dash indicator lights to see what was the matter. Nothing showed up, and it wasn't until I read my trusty owners manual that I found out this is one of the many safety features that Volvo has incorporated into this car. 

My only gripe about the V40 is the fact that the gas cap has to be on very tight or else the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light will come on when the car is started. This caused me a bit of a panic when it first happened. I had to read my owners manual. I tightened my gas cap and all has been well to this point.

Anyone who is interested in a mid-size SUV type vehicle should give this car a try. For the money, it is unsurpassed value.
