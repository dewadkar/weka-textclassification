            This Pontiac powerhouse is amazing! The 3800 engine is supremely powerfull, with no hesitation to perform under one's hard pressing foot. 
The interior has loads and loads of room, and is very very comfortable, altough there are almost too many adjustments to the power seats. The ride is very impressive for a car of this size. The styling is very sporty, yet is crisp and refined. The center console helps to re inforce the sports car like attitude. The rear has lots of room as well, which makes for happy passengers. There is also lots and lots of trunk space, which is a definite plus.  There really is not much that I do not like about the car at all. Gas mileage is even good with average 25-30 mpg.
GREAT CAR!!<br><br>
