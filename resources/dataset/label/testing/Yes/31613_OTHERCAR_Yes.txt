            I bought a Coolpix 800 after hours of searching through reviews and talking to my friendly dealer. My use of photography is so much more widespread since going digital. The Coolpix 800 is certainly beyond my expectations. Image quality is usually excellent with vibrant colours and sharp detail. The flash is reasonably gutsy but can fall short on occasions. I particularly like the ability to adapt the camera with different lenses and the useful range of manual controls. 
Downloading images directly from the camera can be a pain... I only attempted it once after leaving my card reader at work. It is a hit and miss affair requiring constant supervision as it fails frequently.
The camera itself is a tidy unit. I like the compact size and simple interface. Initial thoughts were that it appeared a little 'cheap' but the design has grown on me. I still find the flashcard cover very tacky and unsuitable though, time will tell how long it lasts.
Overall an excellent product with just a few small design weaknesses. At the end of the day image quality is what counts and the Coolpix does not disappoint.<br><br>
