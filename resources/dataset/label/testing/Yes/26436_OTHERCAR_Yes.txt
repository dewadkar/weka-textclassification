            It has driven me nuts that I can't review this car in its own category of Coupe & V6!  But anyway, I absolutely love it.  I have drooled over it for years since they redesigned it to this body style and have finally graduated from college so I am able to afford it.  I did some shopping before I committed to one and am ecstatic with the deal I got ... at the invoice as seen on the internet.

As for the car itself, it is fully leather...and it is very good quality leather.  I love it.  

The seats are way comfortable for long drives and short drives a like also because of the adjustable lumbar support and 8 way power adjustment!  You can move forward while driving without flying all over the place like with manual seat adjusters!!!

The Climate control is awesome.  I had a 96 civic before and always had a nightmare of a time trying to keep it a consistent temperature in the car, but this is great.  You set it to what temp you want it to be in the car and it adjusts the power of the air output to get the entire cabin to be that temperature in as short of time as possible.  If you don't want the air on full blast to get the temp difference there is a control to take it off of auto and you can control the air output.

As for the power, I am very happy with it.  It can cruise along comfortably with the flow of traffic but if you have someone to your left not wanting to let you over don't hesitate on stepping on the gas to get where you want because the car will still jump forward going 85 and punching it.  This morning getting on the freeway a Mustang tried passing me to the right and I saw what he was doing (and was mad because it was raining and easily could have slid out of control on that corner) but I got to the straight part of the turn and punched it...he didnt expect it coming from the family looking accord but I took off and lost that jerk!

The other thing I love is the traction control.  If you are like me and have a heavy foot, on any type of slick surface the car automatically slows to keep your tires from sliding out....which is great to know I have in times like this morning with that jerk in the Mustang!!!

I do a lot of driving long distances and the cruise control is great and surely saving me lots of money on tickets because when I am driving out there and havent put it on it never fails that I look down at the speedometer and see that I am going about 90!  It feels like nothing though because the engine is SOOO quiet and smooth!!!  The 3.0 liter, SOHC, 24 valve, V-6 has 200 horsepower at 5500 RPM and 195 ft-lbs of torque at 4700 RPM. 

This car is top notch in safety also!  It has front AND side airbags.  The seats are smart too!  I know this sounds dumb, but if you put something light on the passenger seat the seat has sensors in it and gets confused because it doesnt know whether or not it should deploy... so a light on the dashboard comes on telling you it is confused... which ends up meaning that you place everything on the floor or backseat.  :)

The other cool thing is you can say good-bye to having to move garage door openers between cars (we have 5 cars at our house!) because it has a homelink system, which means that you just push a button and hold it for a few seconds when the light flashes you hold the opener (activated) up to the light and wait till the light flashes green and now you will never have to havee the actual garage door opener again!!!

Mine came stock with the 16" alloy wheels double spoked.  I love the way they look!  The car looks great driving and just sitting in my driveway. 

The radio comes standard with a AM-FM-CD (6 disc in dash)- cassette deck!  It rocks.  You can listen to music via just about any method you can think of!  I can plug my MD player into the tape deck and even listen to those!!!  But what I love most about the stereo system is the controls on the steering wheel to the volume, radio channel change, and cd forward are perfect.  I have never seen this function before and am using it all the time.  I dont need to look off of the road because the controls are right next to where I keep my hands most of the time!

The maintenance on the car is minimal also, the dealer says that it wont need any major servicing till 100k miles!  This means only the basic oil changes for me!  Talk about saving money and time!!!

This was my dreamcar just looking at it going down the street and now I am even more happy owning it than I thought I would be!  I love it!!!
