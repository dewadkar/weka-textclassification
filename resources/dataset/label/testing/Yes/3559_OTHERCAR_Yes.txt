            Chevrolet 2002 Malibu LS

Roomier and Better than Expected

Just a few months ago, I decided to go to Calgary to visit an ex-associate of mine. Even though we had talked on the phone regularly, we had not seen each other for over three years. 

Stan picked me up at the Calgary International Airport. After my suitcase showed up on the carousel, we proceeded to walk toward the parking lot

As soon as Stan put his hands in his pocket for his car keys, I started to look around for the Continental that I have known him to drive for more than twelve years. To say the lease, I was a bit surprised as I watched him open up the trunk of a new Chevrolet Malibu.

I sat in the passenger side of the front seat and within seconds after Stan sat in the driver�s seat he said. �I noticed you were a bit surprised?� 

Well I was. I have known Stan to drive a new Continental every two years and since I am a Cadillac guy we used to pull each other�s leg on which car was superior.

Since the next day we were planning to go visit some old clients/friends in Red Deer and Edmonton I said. �I hope you will let me drive it a bit tomorrow.� �For sure� He said.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Chevrolet 2002 Malibu LS is not what I would call a very fancy car. It could easily go un-noticed as it passes by on the highway. I do like the proportions of this car, it all seem to fit together nicely and gives the appearance of a solidly built car.

I do not know if the rear spoiler on Stan�s car was an after market add-on or if the car came equipped with it but to me it seemed to be out of place on this 4-door mid-size sedan.

Aside from this and that the car looked to be a bit too small, my first impression of the Malibu LS 2002 is that it looked good.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The Interior:

I was pleasantly surprised about how much leg and headroom this car had once you are inside. The front passenger side is very roomy and a medium built person can really feel very comfortable in this place. 

The same goes for sitting on the driver�s side and the power adjustable driver seat is functional. I have sat in too many power driver�s seats where no matter how much you try to find a setting you like you can never find one.

The interior of the car was all black with leather seats. To me a black interior in a car makes them too somber, I usually prefer cars that have lighter interiors.

Stan�s Malibu had all the power gadgets one would want in a car. It was equipped with power sunroofs, power windows and mirrors, keyless entry and it came with cruise control. I guess that he did not want to loose all the comfort of his Lincolns.

The AM/FM stereo CD player sounded real good. We found out a long time ago that we both like the same music, so the for first leg of our trip between Calgary and Red Deer we enjoyed some 1950 and 1960 oldies but goodies.

The exterior:

As I mentioned in the general description this car could easily go un-noticed.

From the exterior it does give the impression of being a smaller car than it really is. I did like the side view mirrors they give an excellent view of the rear and they have a very small blind spot.

The trunk space is surprisingly large and with the 60/40 fold-down rear seats you can load in the trunk some oversize equipment. Stan wanted to bring some samples to one of his clients in Edmonton; I was surprised to see that all the samples and our two suitcases fit in the trunk.

The tires are mounted on aluminum wheels and as for the rear spoiler I believe that this type of wheels look like they belong much more on a sport car than a 4-door sedan. Of course this is a personal opinion and there is nothing wrong with having aluminum wheels on the Malibu if this is the owner�s preference.

THE ROAD TEST

I did get to drive Stan�s Malibu on the return trip between Edmonton and Red Deer. Aside from the lack of power when trying to pass another vehicle, I did like the way the 2001 Malibu handled on the highway.

Stan�s car is equipped with 4-wheels anti-lock brakes and they worked fine. I only had a limited opportunity to drive the Malibu in the city; I liked the fact that you have an excellent all around view in this car and it is a very easy car to drive within city limits.

We did get less car mileage than the 30 miles per gallon highway that General Motors claims, but I must admit that the car was pretty well loaded with samples on our way up to Edmonton. We got around 25 to 26 Miles per gallon for the whole trip.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Stan�s Chevrolet 2001 Malibu LS was as follows:

Engine: A V6-cylinder, 3.1-liter developing 170 horsepower.
Transmission: Automatic
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS

I usually like to point out the tire sizes but I forgot to take a note.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Well I had the opportunity to drive the Chevrolet 2002 Malibu LS for about 3 hours on the highway and about 1/2-hour within a city limit. In general I like the way this car handles both on the road and within city streets.

I did notice that it lacks power when trying to pass. This is surprising because after all it is a V6 with 170 horsepower. I am wondering if it due to the fact that we had the air-conditioning on or if Stan�s Malibu needs an adjustment.
