            The Honda Accord is perhaps the best car that Honda makes, and better than many of the cars on the road today. However, in my situation of driving this car, which I drive the LX model with standard transmission, four doors, and containing four cylinders. This car may not match up as well to the EX model as you would want.

I know that after nearly nine years, this car has had car problems as would any car when it ages. But I believe the problems would be the same for any car of this model. The problem I had with this car is first of all the space issue. When you have many family members using just this one car, you would be in a situation where you are getting squished around. This car is only meant to hold five normal sized people. If there are more children, maybe this could fit six. Also, since there are just three seat belts in the back, I would recommend just five. Although the best sitting situation is just having four people in the car. Also, another problem is the four cylinders that the car has. This makes for slower driving. It is just harder to speed up with this car. As you go onto steeper roads, it can not speed up very well. The trunk space is pretty adequate, as well as the features, air conditioning, brakes, and so forth. In conclusion, I would say overall, that the Accord is a good car. However, I would recommend, 6 cylinder for better speed. If you are looking for a family car, I would probably recommend a bigger car, because this is not a car that seats very comfortably if you need to use it to carry many people.
