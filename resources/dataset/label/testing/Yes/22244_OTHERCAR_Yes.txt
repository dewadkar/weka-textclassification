                The new m series Z3 is one of the, if not the most exciting car I have ever owned.  It is fast, it accelerates like an anvil falling off a cliff, it handles better than Clinton does women and it looks better than Mrs. America.  I don't really know what else I can say.  There are limited color options, but I don't see this as a major problem.  The interior has a luxurious yet quite sporty look.  The gauges are large and easy to read , while remaining stylish.  This car is quick, that's the best way to describe it. I'm not sure if I can describe to you the feeling of exhileration one gets when driving 95 miles per hour down highway 80 on a sunny afternoon in this awesome automobile.  While the price is more than the Z3 roadster, the extra money is well worth the extra power and handling.  Did I mention this beauty handles like a charm.
For just over 42,000 dollars I highly recommend this car for anyone looking for a convertible in the sport luxury department.  Move over Boxter... here comes the winner.<br><br>
