            The 3500 1 ton purchased new in 1993 has been nothing but a pleasure and absolutely no problems. It is a diesel and am very careful about maintaining proper records of oil and fluid changes. The truck has been used as a tow vehicle for a 32'enclosed car trailer as well as hauling mulch for the wife. Does not drive like a truck but more like a high priced pleasure vehicle. I would probably not get another diesel just because of pricing at the pumps. Either gas or diesel are great engines from Chevrolet. Thank you for reading my opinion and let me know if I can be of any further assistance. <br><br>
