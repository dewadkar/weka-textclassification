            The 1991 Honda Accord, still runs the way it did almost a decade ago, still purrs like a Kitten, still handles like a Caddy, and still smells good. If this is what a Honda Accord is like from 9 years ago, just imagine what one would be like now! 

The Accord that was purchased many moons ago came standard with A/C, and a cassette deck. And the A/C still works! Almost everything about this car is perfect. It handles great with the power steering, and if you see something on the road while you are driving at high speeds, the &quot;anti-lock brakes&quot; will make sure your in good hands, or feet rather!

Speaking of feet, you get tons of feet/leg room for those tall passengers in the back and front.

The trunk space is also huge!

Okay, well not every car is perfect, and the same holds true for the '91 Accord. Sure every now and then you have to give the gas a little tap while starting it up, and sure the brakes fail occasionally. But besides that, I honestly think anyone who is looking to buy their first car, used or new, the Accord should top his/her list.
