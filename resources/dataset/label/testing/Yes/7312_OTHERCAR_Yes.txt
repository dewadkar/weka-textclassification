            This camera is the perfect little picture taker!  With a 1.3 Million Megapixel resolution and a 3x optical 2x digital zoom, this camera is the perfect family camera.  It takes a great standard 4 inch shot and even a great 5x7 shot!  With a built flash and viewfinder, you get exceptional color and maximum satisfaction from your results.  It also has a full LCD screen on the back for an easy-to-use menu system and a a great way to view the photos you've taken.  This camera's film is actually a Smart Media card, which stores high quality pictures.  The camera comes with an 8MB Smart Media card and can hold up to 32 pictures at high resolution.  Cards are available from 8MB up to 64MB of disk space.  Pictures are easily uploaded to your computer through the use of the Serial docking port.  Although many new computers have a USB docking port, a Smart Media USB eternal drive is available for easy uploading.  I would recommend this camera to every family.  It is a great way to share photos with family across the world.
