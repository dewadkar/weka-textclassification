            My little 1993 Saturn Wagon has 142,640 miles (as of 12/16/99) and it still runs like a champ.  When we bought it 3 years ago we hadn't considered a wagon but when we drove it we knew it was the car for us.  

My husband was finishing school in Austin, Texas, and we drove every weekend to Fort Worth, Texas, (about 350 miles round trip) so we needed a reliable, comfortable car.  The bonus we found when we bought the wagon was all of the extra luggage space.

As for the car itself here are the important things you should know if you're considering a Saturn:

-It is a standard and only has a little 4 cylinder engine but I can still get up to highway speeds fast enough to merge with traffic.  The clutch still functions great even with all the miles and the gear shift glides smoothly from gear to gear.

-Great gas mileage.  We get about 30 highway and 23 city.

-A very important feature, especially here in Texas, is the air conditioning system.  The A/C still works great and can cool the car down quickly even when the temp outside is over 100.

-The seats are comfortable though not &quot;cushy.&quot;  

-Leg room is ample, though again not excessive.  My husband and I are both tall and the seats slide back far enough to be comfortable.  If we have someone tall sitting in the back seat we have to move the seat forward some but it's still not cramped.

-There are shoulder belts for back seat passengers.  And, the back seats fold down so you can carry extra big stuff.  

-Older model Saturns don't have true rain gutters on the doors so when it rains and you open the door the water drips in on either you as you're getting in/out of the car or it drips onto the edge of the seat.  A minor thing in the big scheme of things.

-Our wagon has the Saturn CD player which sounds great.  You wouldn't believe the base the little speakers can pound out.

-Dent resistant doors are truly dent resistant.  Our Toyota shows door dings but not the Saturn, pretty cool.

Because we drive this car so much we try to have the oil changed regularly and use the highest octane gas we can find (we've found when it's really hot or really cold and we use regular unleaded the engine knocks around some).  The only items I can think of we've had to replace/fix are: the battery, the tires, the alternator, and the water pump.  

We plan to drive this car until the wheels fall off, and considering how well the car has done we should have many, many more years of cruising.  Saturn makes a really good product and though it is not a luxury car it is well worth the price (and they are very reasonably priced).  <br><br>
