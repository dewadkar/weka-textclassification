            When researching digital cameras, I was looking for one that would work well inside and out. I checked many models and was debating on the Canon Sureshot S20 or the Nikon CoolPix 880. After seeing picture samples of both I decided on the Nikon. 

The size is just right. Small enough to carry in my purse. I wish it would have came with a case though.  I mail ordered the camera from the internet and it had a green pixel that shines brighter than the rest in the LCD. I've heard this is a problem with some laptops too. It doesn't effect the picture quality, so I didn't attempt to send it back. It is just a little annoying to pay so much for something that has a glitch. If you buy from a store you may want to turn it on and look the LCD over first.  

Never owning a digital camera before, I was worried I would not be able to figure it out. It was really easy to understand. There are so many settings it is going to take a while to try them all out.  The scene modes are really cool. I took some awesome sunset pictures with the sunset scene.  The zoom could be a little better, but they have optional lenses you can buy separately.  I bought the 128MB compact flash card and fit several pictures on it in full size, fine quality. The 8MB card that comes with it will not take very many so I would suggest getting a bigger memory card. I suggest also getting the rechargeable battery, a/c adapter and charger. Even with the rechargeable battery it only lasted about two hours.  There is a $50 rebate through Nikon right now, if you buy the rechargeable battery and charger with the camera.

I have not attempted to use Nikon View software, because for me,  it is much easier just to run the card through my HP P1000 Photo Smart Printer.  

I love this little camera. With all the features I will be busy for months trying different projects, lighting, resolutions, etc..
