            I bought this vehicle because I was looking for a roomy four passanger car to replace my aging, rattling Camaro.  Basically, my Camaro began missing transmission gears on a trip to my in-laws and I made the fortuitous decision to get rid of it while it still ran.  So began the research...

I'm a thorough buyer.  I don't make &quot;off the cuff&quot; decisions.  While at my in-laws, I scoured car classifieds, every internet site (including this one) that had information and reviews on different passenger cars, and talked extensively with my father in-law and brother in-law, both Hyundai Sonata owners themselves.  I finally came the conclusion that the Hyundai Sonata, at least on paper, gave equal performance and room to much more expensive vehicles on the market.  Needless to say, I bought a Sonata the next day.  It was (and still is) a gray 1999 GLS with power moonroof, all power options, and wood interior trim.

My only complaint:  the wood trim looks kind of cheesy.  My car has a gray interior, and the wood is colored to have a gray hue.  While not offensive, it's just an odd tone.  I would have preferred a more natural tone, but it's not a big deal.  Also, the car does not have anti-lock breaks.  This isn't a big deal either, but just a consideration.

Now, the good stuff: this car has a lot of great options.  The HVAC system gives a myriad of different choices, from floor and vent to just floor to just vent to defrost and vent to, well, you get the idea.  The power controls all work well.  My car has the basic CD stereo system, and it sounds great for a sedan.  Has two rear speakers and four speakers in the front.  The system has a lot of low-end bass sound if desired.  The back seat is one of the roomiest in its class.  Hop into the back of a Sonata yourself and see!  The truck, while not wonderful, is adequate.  And, the rear seats are split fold-down type, which are GREAT for hauling long objects (such as wood trim, rakes, etc.).  The V6 engine has a lot of pickup and ample power for acceleration; almost as much as my V6 Camaro had!  Gas mileage is decent.  Not as great as a 4 cylinder, but you get the extra power of V6.  But, best of all, the car just rides and handles great.  It has a solid feel.  Nothing appears cheap.  Basically, I love this car.  It handles well in the winter as well and warms up very quickly, so the driver and occupants don't have to freeze for 20 minutes while the car warms up.  And, I bought this car out the door for $12,995 with 25,000 miles.  

Am I happy?  Yes!  Would I recommend it to others?  Yes!<br><br>
