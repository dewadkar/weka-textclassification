            I couldn't be happier with any vehicle.  This van has just about everything anyone would want, even in this day and age of having everything but the kitchen sink.

The GOOD
This van drives like a car - only better because you sit up higher off the road.  The steering is tight and responsive, the acceleration is outstanding, and there is obviously much more room to move around and get comfortable.  There's plenty of room for all your gear (note: I have the extended body style, which I highly recommend) and the seats are easily removed for even more space.  I have a built in child safety seat - perfect for my toddler - and two sliding doors (passenger side is power) for easy loading and unloading.  The stereo system (mine includes CD) kicks, the automatic sliding door can be deactivated should you have any safety concerns, and all the rear seats can be rearranged to how they are most convenient.  I have no rattles, and minimal wind noise.  It drives extremely well in town and on the highway.

On top of everything else, this is a very stylish looking van.  The deep tint on the rear windows gives it a much sportier look than your average mini-van.

Finally, there have been very few features added to the newer models, so you're not really missing much in getting the older one.


The not-so-good
The cup holders aren't in the most convenient of locations, and the crank knobs for adjusting the front seats to laying back and upright positions are too much work.  Other than those two points, I really have no complaints.
