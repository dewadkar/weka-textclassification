            We purchased our brand new 1999 Plymouth Voyager (3 dr.) from the local dealer in July, 1999.  They had extra stock and had an extremely good deal on them.  Ours is not fully loaded, but comfortably loaded (air, cassette, rear de-fogger, tinted side and back windows).

While the mini-van itself runs smooth and the ride is good, we have had several problems almost immediately.  Two weeks after we purchased it we noticed it was leaking.  We immediately brought it in and they discovered a leak on the seal on the transmission gasket.  It was fixed and the same problem occured not even one week later, so back in it went.  They then told us that they &quot;definitely&quot; fixed it that time (makes me wonder what they did the first time).  

Our most major problem to date was a small one, that could have been extremely dangerous.  We were on the expressway and the car starting going.  I pressed on the accelerator and it would not move.  I managed to get off to the side and called the dealer.  The problem this time?  The gas gauge was broken.  We were on empty, yet the gas gauge read 3/4 tank full.  

Aside from these problems, we have had good luck for the 7 months we have been driving the mini-van and for the price we paid, we are pleased.

One sidenote, we have a infant car seat and a child safety seat, both of which fit snugly and firmly with no problem in the second seat.
