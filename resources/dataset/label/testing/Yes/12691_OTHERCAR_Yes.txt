            I bought my 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier LS in 1997.  I paid 14,400 for it with 2 miles on the odometer.  Right now it has 140,000 miles on it and it is absolutely dependable.  I don't even think about "what if it doesn't start".  I put the key in and I go.
The only problem I have had is a water pump that needed to be replaced.  Due to the way the engine is mounted though, this turned out to be a $700 job.  So 1 problem over 6 years and 140,000 miles?  I say that is a stunning success.
Admittedly there is not a lot of room in the rear seats, but this really isn't a car meant to haul a lot of people around in.
I have some issue with the antilock brakes.  Sometimes the idiot light comes on and they sound like a box full of aluminum cans that has been kicked down a set of stairs.
Everything else is great.  Trunk has room, the car has more power than one would think (I got the 2.4 liter) and it is a work horse.
For those of you who say it isn't dependable or it isn't as styled as a BMW or a Lexus . . . I'll buy 2 of these for the price of one of those.  Oh, and Hyundai owners?  I pass them broken down on the side of the road all of the time.
Without a doubt the best purchase I have ever made.  I have no doubt this car will easily make it to 200,000 miles with little problem.
How many car owners can say that?  Plus, it's a Chevy!  Repairs are fairly easy and every garage can do it.
I put oil in it every 5000 miles, replace the air filter and tires every now and then, and keep gas in it.  Other than that, it requires no maintenance.
As a used car today, I would say it is worth $3000 (mine, with 140,000 miles on it).
