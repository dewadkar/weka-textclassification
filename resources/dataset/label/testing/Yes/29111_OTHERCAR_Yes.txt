            I am the proud owner of a Toyota Tacoma 4 wheel drive truck. I made the mistake of purchasing a 2 wheel drive S-10 some time ago...never again!  The Tacoma handles well; it's turning radius is phenomenal.  Considering it has on it the biggest tires it can come with from the factory, it handles really well and is great on the highway. Somewhat rough, but better than expected. 
It's acceleration is great and has plenty of power for a 4 cylinder. I'm comparing it to the S-10 I had, which had zero power compared to this!
Cab space leaves something to be desired, but I'm a woman and still can't complain about that. We've had no real problems so far. It's really saying something for the company if the only complaint I have is that there isn't a mirror on the driver's side sunvisor!  For once, I will be a repeat customer. (Only next time I'll get an extended cab. Don't expect to pile anyone inside with the bucket seats.)
If you need something that's stylish but functional (snow or hauling items), this truck completes both tasks extremely well.<br><br>
