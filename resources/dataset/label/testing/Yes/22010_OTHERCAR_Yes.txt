            I had different cars, but this is my "wish car."  

I bought a certified pre-owned 1999 Lexus LS400 (black exterior/black interior) with 34,500 miles and a new set of Proxes H4 tires for $35,995 three weeks ago.  Also, they replaced the wheels with new factory chrome wheels as part of the deal.  The car is in excellent condition that most people think it's brand new.

The V8 engine producing 290hp is very responsive with a very smooth and comfortable ride.  The cabin is quiet at any speed.  The seven speaker stereo with the 6-disc CD changer is awesome.  The car comes with so many safety, luxury and convenience features, i.e. HID headlights, daytime running lights, dual front and side airbags, vehicle skid control, traction control, electronic throttle response, VVT-i, power moonroof, keyless entry with remote trunk lid opener and remote moonroof/window open feature, 4 wheel ventilated disc brakes, dual ABS system, HomeLink Garage/Gate remote control, leather seats, leather/burlwood steering wheel and shift knob, auto-dimming mirrors, dual tilt-down side mirrors, dual climate control, automatic sound leveler and lots more.

A great car with an outstanding dealer customer service and warranty to boot.  After purchased, I mentioned to the dealer that the steering wheel has a hairline crack and they replaced it.  They even provided me with a Lexus RX300 as a free loaner.  The warranty on a certified pre-owned Lexus is 3 years/100,000 total miles.  It also comes with a 24-hour roadside assistance, free loaner car for qualified repairs, free oil and filter change or 5,000 mile service within 90 days of purchase, there are no deductibles, and should you have a breakdown while away from home, you will be provided with meals and lodging for a maximum of 3 nights (up to $200 per night) while repairs are performed on your car, in addition to a rental car for up to 5 days (up to $50 per day). 

This purchase is the next best thing to buying it brand new.
Practicality is the rule.
