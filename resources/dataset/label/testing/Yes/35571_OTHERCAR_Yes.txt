            After having a used car, and having that used car die on me, I decided to save up for a brand new JAPANESE car.  It was between Honda and Toyota.  What should I get? I asked myself - Camry?  Civic?  Corolla?  Accord?  It was tough, but I decided on the Honda Civic 2 door.  I saved up 9 months just to get the down payment so I could then pay monthly so it would eventually be mine.  Saving up was worth it.
  I bought a black 2 door.  I was so happy, couldnt believe I bought a new car.  Payments are cheap, service is great, the car runs excellent (except for a few flukes I will discuss) and the gas milage is great.  This was a good investment even though an investment in a car is always not that great.  I am sure this Honda will last me 300,000 miles without a doubt.
  I easily get 35-38 miles to the gallon on the highway and 30something miles to the gallon on the streets in the city.  I save money on gas, since the prices have been high latley.  
  The interior is nice, and even nicer when I added my own CD player by Sony.  The speakers were not that great so I changed those as well, but usually stock speakers are not good int he first place.  The orange lights on the odommeter and speedometer are cool looking and it does not feel crowded when you have a full car load of people.  
  The exterior is black, but that was my fault to get a black car and complain that it gets dirty.  The car is easy to clean though.  
  The engine is small, but it has guts.  It takes me where I have to go and it feels like there is a V-tech engine even though it is a mere 1.4 litre engine.  Makes a nice sound when you have to use the gas.  
  The only problem I seem to be having is the fact that my struts are already squeeking after only 10,000 miles.  No problem though, for Honda gives all their customers a 3 year, 30,000 mile guarantee, which I will take advantage of.  They even through in 3 free oil changes.  
  This car looks good, runs good, sounds good and works well.  I would say screw the American cars and try one of these Honda's.  Worth the investment.  I dont know what these Japanese guys do out there, but it seems that you see more and more Honda's everyday on the road, more than other cars.  
  This car cost me a little over 14,000 before taxes.  I bought the LX model.  This is before the luxury EX model which has more options - which is just a sun roof and better speakers.  The spoiler and rims are much more extra and do cost a pretty penny, and i felt I did not need them.

Take this Honda for a test drive - cheat on your current car - it's okay!!
