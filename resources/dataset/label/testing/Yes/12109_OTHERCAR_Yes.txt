            I own a 93 Chevy Blazer LT Tahoe, the odometer just turned 90,000 miles and it will be turning for a long time. The blazer is a great car, its fairly cheap to operate and reliable. Mine has the H.O. Vortec motor with 200 horsepower and 260 ft/lbs of torque, this engine makes the blazer pretty quick and the transmission shifts great. It rides pretty good except for some banging on really deep ruts and bumps, but hey, its a real truck. theres been some minor issues like the rear washer not working and the wipers popping up about 2 in two much after turned off but as for major issues aside from common things that are expected to fail as the miles goes up the reliability of the truck is great. If you take good care of your blazer it will turn over the first time every time like mine does. The only thing thats annoying thats common to all blazers is the rear tailgate/liftglass/outside mounted spare tire carrier(if equipped) it makes noise and rattles but I spray WD-40 on all the moving parts including where the glass clips into the tailgate and it helps out a lot. The interior is typical GM with some cheap plastic but that doesn't really bother me and I feel that its a tight, soild truck and if you can get one in good shape like mine you should be very happy with it. This is the 2nd blazer I've owned, The first being a 92 2 door and they have both been great, trustworthy cars for me, the first one had to be let go with only 83,000 miles on it because of an accident. The 4 doors ride better then the 2 doors and have more back seat room and cargo room but if you can buy a late model blazer in good shape you should be very happy with it. One thing to look out for is rusting, older blazers tend to rust on the bottoms of the doors and the fenders down on the bottom by the wheels but besides that, there awsome trucks
