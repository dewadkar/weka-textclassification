            I just got my 4700 a few weeks ago, but I'm already thrilled with the purchase.  I wanted a small, fully featured multi mega-pixel digital camera to replace my old, huge Nikon SLR, and to take shots of my newborn son to send via email to family and friends around the country.  I knew nothing of digital cameras when I started my search two months ago, and my search results kept bringing me back to the FinePix 4700.

While I admit being drawn to the latest and greatest technology, this camera seems to have it all.

First, it's small.  Very small.  It's shape is a bit awkward at first, but that discomfort lasted about a day.  Actually the design works well, because you never have to worry about your fingers ending up in front of the lens.  The camera is taller than it is wide.  Did I mention it's small?  Small enough to fit into a shirt breast-pocket.  I'm talking small.

Fuji somehow was able to fit a lot of useful features into the small package.  First of all, and most important in a digital camera, is the resolution.  I'm not an expert of pixels, and I know there is a controversy as to whether this camera is a 4 mega cam or not.  Regardless, I don't care.  You can choose 640x480, 1280x960, or 2400x1800, though a 1600x1200 would work well and save some SmartMedia card space.  Oh well.  Regardless, the picture quality is OUTSTANDING.  You can take rapid fire shots (about 3 in 1 second), and the camera even has a digital movie (AVI format) movie mode (with sound!) for up to 80 seconds of video.  Cool.

All of these features come in a package that is easy to use.  I'm not a manual reader, and while I have some photography experience, I'm more comfortable just pointing and clicking.  But this camera is easy to use, and I have found myself using the manual settings and various modes to experiment, something you might not be as happy to do if you had to buy and pay to develop film.  Everything has been easy to use and figure out because if the simple and intuitive design, thought I'm sure the 100 page plus manual is very detailed and helpful.:)

The camera powers up and is ready to use in about 2 to 3 seconds, which is nice to get those spontaneous shots.  The 3X optical zoom is enough to get by, though I always want more zoom.

Battery life is also great.  It uses Ni-MH rechargeable AAs.  The camera came with a charger and 2 pairs, so you don't need to buy additional power.  I can get about 100 shots per charge (the charger takes about 12 hours to charge fully, so plan ahead), depending on how much I use the 2&quot; LCD, flash, or playback photos.  You are even ok to use premium alkalines in an emergency.

The built in USB is fast.  The flash, while small, is good enough.  The screen system is very easy to use and I think adds to the battery life because you don't have to use the LCD unless you are editing or playing back photos.  You can pan and zoom in on photos with ease.

Now if I could only find a small enough case for the camera, I'd be in business.

If you want a full featured, small digital camera, don't look any further than the FInePix 4700.  If you do, you'll keep coming back to it.  I did.
