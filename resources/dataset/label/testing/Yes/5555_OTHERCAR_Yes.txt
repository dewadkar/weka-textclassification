            I bought my swift in April 2000.   This car is fantastic!
We bought a 5 speed manual shift, gray in color.
I highly recommend this car.  The fuel mileage is out of this world.  I have changed the oil already 2 times since we bought it.  As far as roominess, not much but we knew that before I gave them the money.  It will seat 4 comfortably.  Dont try 5.  On long trips, we remained comfortable.  The only thing that I found wrong with this car is that when you are running the air conditioner, dont plan on going very fast because of the pull this ac has, it boggs down the engine.  
The hatchback is extremely convenient as you dont have to throw all your groceries in the backseat.  My girlfriend refers to this car as the &quot;Giant Egg&quot;.   Its not a bad thing.  
The Stereo is a am/fm cassette and has very good sound for being a factory install.  Here is the best thing!
As we are going through the high prices of gasoline, it only costs $12.00 to fill this car up with premium unleaded fuel.  With all the driving I do back and forth it makes it very affordable.   Buy this car.  You wont regret it.
