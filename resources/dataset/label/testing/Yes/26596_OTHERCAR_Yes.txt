            I purchased this vehicle used, with about 45,000 miles on the odometer, in '97.  Previously, I had a Ford F-150, so it was a big change.  
Although the car did turn out to be a huge change, it indeed was a good one.

------------------------------------------------------------
Body:  When the LHS/New Yorker debuted, I immediately felt drawn to the styling. I do believe that Chrysler made this car a "hit-or-miss" item, much like the PT Cruiser of late, and it showed by the opinions of friends who made fun of my "Grandma Car."  I, for one, would recommend the cab-forward design, as it greatly definitely adds to the aerodynamic qualities of the car.  The easiest way to describe the actual stying is "fluid."  


------------------------------------------------------------
Interior:  I have never been a fan of leather, but I was after this car. I cannot stand "plush leather," the kind that wrinkles up when you get out of the car and is supposed to be "soft."  My New Yorker had a stiffer leather, and I found it to be very comfortable (and much easier to clean and keep care of). The power seat and lumbar support only added to the comfort level.  I am 6'4" and about 250 and have a hard time fitting into most vehicles, but no problems here. Plenty of legroom. I have never been a fan of Infinity sound systems, but the one with the car was more than adequate (7 speakers, CD changer). The power controls were well within easy reach for me and any passengers.


------------------------------------------------------------
Engine:  Here was my biggest pro.  The 3.5 litre V-6 performed as well as any other V-8 I have owned (with exception to a Trans Am, but that goes without saying). Plenty of passing power and more than adequate pedal response. Chrysler's electronic tranny made the shifting easy on the "jar factor," although it also made it respond a little slow at times due to the shifting of the tranny itself. No big deal... 


------------------------------------------------------------
Overall:  I myself have had no problems with the car, and would recommend it to anyone who can find one under about 65,000 miles and that has been well taken care of.  Some that I have come across with more mileage are not worth the price tag.  The LHS/New Yorker has had a fault with depreciation, so if you plan on purchasing one, plan on keeping it awhile before trading it in, especially if you are financing one.
