            I recently purchased a 1991 GMC S-15 Jimmy ST.  I bought this Jimmy because I could get it for $2,000.  My intent was to turn around, sell it, and make a profit off it.  After driving it for awhile though, I began to like the S-15 Jimmy.  It is very roomy.  Mine is only a two door, but it is still able to carry four comfortably.  I myself got in the back seat, and to my surprise it had ample legroom even with the front seats all the way back.  I love the way the front bucket seats grip your sides.  I also like the fact that back seat lays downs giving your ample cargo room.  When going over bumps, the back is a little bouncy but this might be do to my shocks; I am not sure if this is the same for all the Jimmy's or not.  

My model has the 4.3-liter, 5-speed.  The motor is very strong running.  It had 113,000 miles on it when I bought.  The oil psi was running between 60 and 80, so I went to the local "Discount Auto Parts", and purchased two bottles of oil detergent.  I poured only one bottle in at first, and after about 30 miles I saw a difference.  The psi dropped down 20 psi.  I wanted it to run between 20 and 60 psi so I poured the other bottle in.  It has been about two weeks now, and the detergent has finally gotten the psi's down the 20 at throttle.  On cold mornings, it does go up to 80 but not for long.  

Although the engine has 113,000 miles on it, it runs as if it is new.  It is a little loud when cranking up but I believe this is because the person before me probably never changed the oil.

On the 5-speed there is a hydraulic clutch.  The thing about it is that it does not have any adjustments on it.  The clutch does not grab until the pedal is almost all the way to the top.  Therefore, to fix this problem I am going to have to replace the clutch.  When I first got the car, it would occasionally miss second gear when I would pull it down.  It has not done this lately; so, I think the oil had just thickened up in all the cold weather - because the person before me had not driven it any more that 10 times in the last 6 months.

However, I definitely recommend a jimmy for anyone looking for a nice riding car with lots of room for a reasonable price.
