            After much research I bought a 2002 Jetta 1.8 turbo.  I read a lot of unhappy messages about reliability of VWs, but I noticed that as time moved on the complaints decreased.  There were fewer complaints about 1999s than there were of 1998s, and fewer complaints about 2000 than 1999s.  I'm gambling that by 2002 the VW factories in Mexico have mastered their trade.  
  Anyway, I've had it for about a month now and am pretty happy with it.  I've never owned a "sporty" car before (I used to drive large GM family sedans) and it is a nice change.  The handling, acceleration and braking are all great.  The car feels very taut, though the acceleration feels a bit funny, not as smooth or as predictable as my wife's Forester, but then that just might be the nature of the two vehicles.  I don't know, yet.  Most people will say the rear seat is smallish, but then you have to know that as soon as you see the car - it is a small family sedan.  It fits two adults fine and for young families, little kids will be good too, especially with the side air curtains.  And the front cockpit is very roomy especially head room, even with the sunroof.  
  My only real complaint is that the car came with the front ash-trays full.  But that is the dealer's fault not VWs (I'm assuming). There was also a small, obvious stain on the rear seat (leather).  I got it out easily, but still its a brand new car and I'm highly disappointed that whoever prepped my car cared so little about it. 
   I just heard that there is a recall on 2000 -2002 VWs regardings emissions problems, so I will have to check into that, but then most cars have some sort of recall.  It seems minor anyway.
   Bottom line, if you are looking for a nicely built, sporty handling & looking (my opinion anyway) car.  The Jetta is definitely something to consider, also, it has pretty decent cargo space for a small car.
