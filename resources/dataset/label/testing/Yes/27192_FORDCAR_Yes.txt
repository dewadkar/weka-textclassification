            My husband and I needed a new car after our '93 Geo Metro finally bit the dust.  We had always liked the Ford Focus after driving a 2000 rental model on our annual trip to my hometown, so we decided to take a look at the new Focus ZX3 hatchback. 

From the second we test drove, we liked the features and the new design style in this vehicle.  The first thing I thought of the new body style was that I expected wings to pop out from the sides and take off flying.  The design has attracted quite a bit of attention among people we know!  The interior is surprisingly roomy for a compact car, and the extra features (cruise control, CD player, auto-dim lights) were a welcome addition.  The features are easy to operate and after a quick read-through of the manual (easy to understand!), we were off in our new Focus.

The one thing that I highly dislike about this car, though, is the *very* restrictive seatbelts.  When you put them on, the slack snaps back so fast that you feel like you're being choked.  Also, it's very difficult to manuever around once the belt is on.  I have extremely short arms and need to roll down the windows on occasion for fresh air.  This is impossible with the seatbelt design - most of the time I have to take it off completely to roll the window down, which is extremely dangerous.  Also, the passenger side cup holders are smaller than expected - I cannot get a simple bottle of soda into it, although the driver's side is nice and roomy.  This is probably due to the design of the car.  However, I have no other complaints about this car, and frankly the features that you get for the price are well worth it.  I didn't mention the trunk - it is absolutely *huge* for a hatchback car, and I love the way the seats fold down so that you can't see what's in it - a terrific &quot;security&quot; feature.

The control of this car is amazing.  We have driven on a sheet of pure ice in our driveway and the Focus never fishtailed at all.  It handles well on wet pavement and the fog lights are an extra plus!  The high beams are *very bright*, however, so you should take extra care in using them.  On dry pavement it's a dream....

The hatchback ZX3 model would be perfect for young couples (such as my husband and myself), as well as first time car buyers and people who want a little extra value in their vehicle for a not-so-big price tag.  I wouldn't recommend this for families with kids, though, as setting up car seats and whatnot could be a problem.  It's extremely roomy in the back but just getting in it at first may test your nerves.  

If you want a terrific vehicle without a terrifically outrageous price, this is the car for you.  Highly recommended.<br><br>
