            I wanted a sports car.  Sadly, I couldn't afford to do it right so instead I bought the Honda coupe.  There has been a long line of Honda/Acura history in my family so I knew it would be a great car.  

The main reason I got it however was for the two doors.  I had been tricked by them and felt they would satisfy my need for a sports car.  Looking at the new Honda coupe models, I still feel this.  They are truly sports coupe.  The older model coupe however is not.  The more and more you use it, the more you realize that they just took the sedan and lost two of the doors.  The loss of the two doors really aren't worth it either.

Other than that though, the car has had a stellar performance.  I have had no maintenance issues (other than a filter or belt replacement here or there) after almost 2 years.  Even though its not really a sports car, it packs quite a punch.  Honda knows how to make the most out of an engine and any Accord will easily outperform cars with similar specs.  For a coupe, the backseat area is very roomy and the front seat is incredible legroom.  The car handles great and is a beautiful ride.
