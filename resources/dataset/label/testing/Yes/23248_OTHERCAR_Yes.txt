                I just purchased this vehicle in early December, I have just one word to describe this excellent vehicle &quot;THRILLING&quot;. Some say that I was stupid to pay $20k more for just one second faster than the E430 with Sport Package, but it was well worth it. There is simply nothing that I hate about this car, everything it just excellent. The interior is extremely well design and seats up to four people comfortably. To drive this car car in NYC is hair raising, I get people looking at this beautiful car and ask they ask me &quot;is this a new car?&quot;
    I recently took this car to upstate state on an airfield. I push this car way past 155 and probably reached speeds up to 185. From 0-60 my time was 4.92 seconds. You could disable the ASR and mash the gas pedal and burn away with style and grace.
    This car is high recommended for people who have love sport cars, but want more seating. This car can 100% certain to  outrun a viper,corvette, and even a Porche. This car can go faster than a Cessna 182 Skylane. This car is way better than the M5 my brother has and the back part is that this car is limited production to 500 per year, most of the cars are already pre order already by dealers and could cost you up to 90k that 20k more than the msrp. I paid only 75k. (Lucky)
    I can't wait 'till my S55 AMG comes and be sure to read my review of another well tuned car from AMG!!<br><br>
