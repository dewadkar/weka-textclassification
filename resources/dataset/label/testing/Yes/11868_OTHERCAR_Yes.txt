            My Honda 2002 Civic is my first "new" car. Being a student it is a bit pricey, but it's the Honda name and assurance your paying for. I love it. I feel very safe in it and it handles very well in the snow (I use stock tires). It is incredibly fuel efficient, which is great. I usually can't remember the last time I filled up! The problems I do have though, is that the back right door is not air tight. I have checked this out in other Honda 2002 Civics and the problem is in all of them. It is also a very popular car, so if you want to be unique, I don't recommend it. As well, the pick up is slow at times, but you can get up to high speeds (160km)with "the raddeling".
It is an awsome car which holds its value (a good selling point for the parents!), and I would recommend it to anyone.
