            This car really has me spoiled!  It will probably outlive me!! Seriously - my '93 Toyota Corolla has really been worth every cent I originally spent on it.  I bought it used - in 1994.  It was my first car.  I read all the reviews for cars in it's class and it seemed to be the best value for the cost.  It has lived up to all my expectations... 

My little Corolla has been so reliable for me - it has never broken down on me - never left me stranded anywhere! It's been as far North as New York (I live in Ohio) and as far south as South Carolina - with 0 problems.  Besides the usual maintenance and replacements (tires, brakes) I haven't really had to do much with it.  It's still got about as much zip in it as when I first got it.  

It still looks good - no problems with rust yet (even in our nasty winters!)  I still love the look of it - much better than the latest models. The inside is just as good as the outside - nice looking interior.  The controls are easy to reach and to work. My automatic transmission has it's gear shift on the floor. It's convenient and easy to use. I get great mileage too. The heating system keeps the car cozy when it's needed and the a/c does it's job just as well. There is plenty of leg room up front and in the back - comfortable for four people. There is plenty of room in the trunk as well.

The only drawback might be if you're looking for a huge interior. It's just right for four people to fit in comfortably. A fifth person could squeeze into the back but it gets a little tight. For a compact car though - it really is adequate. Overall I really can't say enough about it. I love this car - I would definitely buy it all over again!<br><br>
