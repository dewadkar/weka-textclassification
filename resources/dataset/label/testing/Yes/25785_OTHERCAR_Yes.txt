            I bought my 93 Nissan Altima after my current car was hit head on.  Although I didn't want to buy another car, I didn't have a choice.  I must say that I have been pleasantly surprised by my purchase.  

The car has an attractive interior with intuitive controls.  Visibility is good even for someone a little shorter.  Interior room is pretty good for the front but the rear can be cramped if a large person is sitting in the front seat.  Trunk room is average for a small/mid sized car.  There is a mini spare tire in the trunk along with a hidden jack.  The engine is peppy, at least with a 5 speed manual transmission.

The only negatives I have are with some cosmetics.  I prefer alloy wheels and this model comes with hubcaps.  Other than that, this car performs well and is very reliable.  (It also has good gas mileage - very important while gas prices are shooting through the roof!)
