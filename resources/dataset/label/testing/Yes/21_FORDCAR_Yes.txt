            I have a FORD TAURUS. When I bought it, it was already driven for about 20,000 miles. However, it is in a very good condition.

What I like about the car is that it has excellent parameters for driving in the city. I checked a comparative catalog, and out of all other FORD brands for 1999, FORD TAURUS is the least fuel consuming car. Just what I need! Imagine the savings. 
There is a lot of space inside and it is a very solid car. It is easy to drive and manoeuver. It is exactly MY TYPE OF CAR.

What I don't like about the car. The shape of the back of the car as well as the dashboard are not much for my taste.
Sometimes I have problems with the on-board computer. Since it is trying to remember my speed, there are times when it simply speeds up without me pressing on the gas. But that is not much of a problem and I am expecting to have that fixed soon.

Otherwise, I love everything else about my Ford Taurus.
