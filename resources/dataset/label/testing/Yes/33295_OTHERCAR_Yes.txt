               The mini SUVs are all the rage, and why shouldn't they be?  They offer the flexibility of a station wagon, the traction of a 4 wheel drive and better gas mileage than that of their bigger brothers. Visually, they do take some getting used to.  After all, they are shrunken versions of the big boys we are all used to.  But, once you own one, you'll see their beauty as a new parent views their adorable baby. 

   I've had my '98 Subaru forester for 2 years and 20k miles, and it's thumbs up for this vehicle.  The ride is extremely smooth and quiet and it handles in snow like a champ!  Seats are firm (the way I like them) and the driver's seat has 2 manual lumbar back adjustments.  Consumer Reports rated the Forester as the best among the mini SUVs and my experience with my Forester supports that.  

   I own the L model which is in the middle price range.  I picked it up for $19,000 which included an excellent security system, automatic transmission, and some other minor options.  The large 165 hp 4 cyl. engine is the spunkiest of the mini SUVs.

   But all is not perfect with the L model Forester. My biggest gripe (it may seem petty to some) is that the outside rear view mirrors are manual..not even a toggle adjustment! You have to stick your hand out the window to change your mirror adjustment.  The basic stereo system is pretty weak.  The Forester has a nice molded-plastic insert for the rear deck (protects against stains and dirt) but cargo slides around like crazy if you put anything on it.  The AC and heat seem to take their time getting the job done, but I think that is due to the large interior dimensions (there is excellent head room and visibility).

  My Forester has been recalled twice.  Once to change axle grease, and the second to replace the master brake cylinder.

  Now with all of the minor negatives out of the way, I still recommend this vehicle.  Subaru has an excellent record of reliability (except for rust) and I feel very comfortable and safe when driving it.  Expect the Forester to run reliably for 10 years and at least a 100k miles.  Below are some specs.
