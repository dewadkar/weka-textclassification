            I have a 1994 Ranger XLT SuperCab that I bought almost 6 years ago...It's still wonderful! It has a standard transmission and rear fold-out jump seats.  This truck has been great! I've taken it on trips between CA and TX at least 10 times. I also drove to IL from CA in the middle of April..through snow, rain, sleet, hail, and sun! It's never broke down, never left me on the side of the road. It currently has 144,698 miles and keeps on purring!  The body and features have held up amazingly well, no major defects. The only quirks it has attained have to do with the stick for shifting...during the past 2 summers the glue gets hot and the nob comes off...but with all the miles and no problems...small price to pay! The only thing I hate is that it has a different size tire then other vehicles...special to rangers. Makes tire buying expensive..but since that and the brakes are the only major things I've had to replace...it's dealable!<br><br>
