            This is the best purchase I have ever made in an automobile - people have stopped me in the street to ask me the make and model. For a small car (I have the 4 cyl. V-Tech) this car has amazing get up and go. I chose the EX with all the extra's - sound system is clean and clear and the moon roof has some nice options for positioning. Gas mileage on the highway is around 30 mpg though back roads drop the mileage dramatically to around 20. This car would be great for most everyone, I am planning on buying another in the spring for my teenagers.<br><br>
