            I wanted a car that I could thrash, and this fit the bill.  It has enough horsepower to keep me busy, and the transmission is excellent.  The handling is MUCH better than any standard Civic (or most other cars in that price range).  In fact, I can't think of any other $17K car that has the power, handling, efficiency, and style of the Civic.  By the way, this version of the Si totally beats the 2002 version.

The engine is amazing.  It has the standard VTEC flat points in the midrange, but once it gets going above 4500 RPM (it switches cams at 5600 en route to an 8000 RPM redline), it's a blast.  The transmission is VERY easy to operate, and it's very easy to do heel-toe manuevers, etc.  You can switch gears very quickly with this setup, and keep the engine in the sweet spot all the way to the triple digits.

I find the seats comfortable for even long trips, which I can't say for many cars (even much more expensive ones).  I actually like the stying (inside and out) of this car.  It comes complete with a decent stereo system, A/C, cruise control, sunroof, flip down rear seats, etc.  

The problems are in the difficulty of driving the car.  Without traction control and ABS, the car tends to oversteer a lot and the brakes can lock up easily.  If you can't handle these conditions, I would NOT recommend this car to you because you'll wind up in a ditch or worse.  Police and thieves know all about the Civic Si, and it's a big target for them.  Insurance companies also are aware of it, and they reward you with pretty high premiums for the policies.

The last complaint is that it's noisy to operate.  At 70MPH, it's hovering above 4000RPM in 5th gear.  That, and the standard Michelin XGT V4 tires, and the lack of soundproofing make this car quite noisy to operate.  As most people who would buy this car would probably change the thing around to make it more noisy, it's probably a non-issue to most buyers.  

In short, I love this car.  It's fun, fast, affordable, and I really don't have to care about it (but I do).
