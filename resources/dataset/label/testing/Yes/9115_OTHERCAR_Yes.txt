            Yes, they're cheap.  Yes, they're not exciting or fancy.  But after nearly 6 years, I am really happy with my little Kia.  It runs great, gets awesome mileage and is well worth what I paid for it (not much).

It hasn't been perfect.  When I first got it, there were some weird bird-like squeaking sounds coming out of the car.  I had to take it to the shop a couple of times because they misdiagnosed the problem not once, but twice.  The blame for those problems is definitely on the mechanic I was using and not Kia.  The problem turned out to be minor (heat shield-related), and since this happened while under warranty (3 years, not bad), I didn't pay a cent to fix it.

Since the warranty expired, I have been waiting for the car to die or fall apart.  Instead, it just keeps running and running well, to boot.  The car has a nice kick and does great on the steepest hills of San Francisco.  I am always zooming past much more expensive cars when the lights turn green at intersections.  It's pretty spacious, too.  While I am only 5'2&quot;, one of my friends who is 6'8&quot; has been in the car a lot and thinks it is quite roomy.

This is a great car for anyone on a modest budget, including students or people just starting out in the work world.<br><br>
