            Generally, I don't like sport-utility vehicles.  I think they're overweight, bulky, gas-guzzling monstrosities that have little place on the road.  I recommend that you carefully evaluate your needs when considering an SUV.  Truth be told, if you never go off road, don't own a trailer, and don't have to carry more than 4 people (including yourself) an SUV is not for you.

That said, if you choose to ignore me and pick an SUV anyway, you really can't do much better than this one.  The Chevy Trailblazer is all new for the 2002 model year, carrying over nothing from its ancestor, the smaller and less refined Blazer (a compact SUV based on the S-10 pickup).  The reason the Trailblazer carries nothing over is because they have improved nearly everything about SUVs, and GM has set its sights quite squarely on the market leader, the venerable Ford Explorer.  It's clear looking at this truck that they wanted to better the Explorer on as many fronts as possible.

And they succeeded.

The new Trailblazer comes with only one engine; a 270HP 4.2L inline six.  Those of you who remember back to the 60s will remember GM used to have a straight six similar in size to this one, but there is no relation between the two that I'm aware of.  This powerplant can be described in one word, and that word is "perfect".  Power delivery is immediate and luxury-car smooth.  The engine is properly subdued, not noisy or thrashy at all.  Simply put, this straight six is an engineering masterpiece, and will hopefully see duty in other vehicles as well.  This engine is mated to a typical GM 4-speed automatic transmission, which for once didn't seem to feel the need to hunt for gears on hills or hesitate when passing.  It provided reliable, crisp shifts, and when power wasn't demanded, remained calm and reserved.  A manual transmission is unavailable at any price.

The truck rode wonderfully, soaking up bumps, expansion joints and other various and sundry irregularities with ease.  For a conventional unibody CAR, the ride would've been very good, but this is a body-on-frame full-bore TRUCK.  In that regard, the ride is exceptional, with none of the shakes, rattles, or thumps associated with this type of vehicle.  Car-like is not the right word.  "Limo-like" would be a bit more appropriate.

This SUV also comes equipped with a semi-conventional 4WD system, but adds a feature called AutoTrac.  Essentially, you leave the selector in Auto 4WD mode, and when the vehicle detects rear-wheel slippage, it will automatically engage the front wheels to provide more traction.  It does NOT function the same way as a true AWD system, and is not superior to a true AWD setup, but it is better than a conventional 4WD system, which cannot be safely used on dry roads.  Perhaps this is merely a stopgap until GM can develop (or steal) a full-time AWD system for this truck.

The interior of the Trailblazer I drove was finished well, with one of the big bucks luxury packages.  It included 8-way power seats with lumbar support, a stereo with CD changer, automatic climate control (something I could've lived without), satellite controls for the HVAC and stereo, and a whole bunch of other stuff designed to make life as a driver or passenger a little easier.  Some things this model didn't come with were off-road tires (on a 4WD truck?!) and heated seats.  Other than that, the interior was easily a place I could set up camp in and live.  Room was spacious all around, even in the back.  Rear seat passengers will not want for legroom nearly as much as they would have in the previous Blazer.

Exterior-wise, the truck was tastefully designed to be more stylish than the afore-mentioned Explorer.  It's got more flair than the Ford, but isn't likely to offend anyone.  It's a sharp-looking truck, especially in black with the two-tone trim package.

My quibbles with this SUV are minimal.  First, the rear load floor is a shade high.  I wouldn't likely have had much trouble getting stuff in there, but those of a slightly shorter persuasion (anyone under about 5'9") might have difficulty.  Fuel mileage is typically below-average, as this IS a truck, but not any worse than any of its competition.  Maneuvering in close quarters will also be a hassle; despite this being a relatively small SUV, it's still porky compared to a car, and will be more difficult to park.

Again, I ask you to carefully evaluate your needs versus your wants when shopping for an SUV.  If you don't need one, don't buy one.  But if you DO need an SUV, but not one of the bigger monster SUVs like the Ford Expedition or Chevy Tahoe, the Trailblazer is among the best in the field.

If for some reason, the Trailblazer doesn't suit you, there are several other SUVs you can choose from.  There's the Explorer, obviously.  There's also the Dodge Durango, Toyota Highlander (a car-based SUV with Toyota reliability), as well as the Trailblazer's stablemates, the Olds Bravada and GMC Envoy (which won Motor Trend's SUV of the Year award).  All of these SUVs are about the same size and about the same price, but few compare favorably to the Trailblazer.
