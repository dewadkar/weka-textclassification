            99 1500 3 door 5.3 vortec auto 2wd 6ft bed tow pk

This was my first truck, it won't be my last.
I needed an all around work horse, i got one.

How do I love thee, let me count the ways...
towing, hauling, pulling, driving, washing.
This truck rides like a car the interior is 
great a\c is cold fit and finish just right for
a truck. The drive line is strong and smooth and
for the past year and half (22,000 miles) I just wave as  
I go by the service shop.

Maybe some one should tell this p/u it's not a car
did honda build it for GMC?
WHO should buy this vehicle, the better question is 
WHO SHOULD'T.
