            Since my husband just got promoted, we felt it was time to put our old 1987 Escort out to pasture and get my husband something that he wanted. We learned a couple things during this experience. First, stand by you price. The sales people kept leaving us to talk to the man in charge and kept coming back with a price that we didn't like. The last time they came back and asked us how far above our price that we were willing to go, this was after four hours of being there, I told them, &quot;ZERO!&quot;. After that, we didn't have a problem with them coming down to our price. Second, get what you really want. We drove home the Sport model that night without signing anything and was not impressed. The next day, we returned the truck and bought the SLT Club Cab. This is an awesome truck. It rides as nice as a car, seats six people and is simply beautiful. We have already taken it on a short trip and it was great on the freeway. Its got a lot of power under the hood. It's also one of the most safest trucks to drive. We've only had it for three weeks, but love it!   <br><br>
