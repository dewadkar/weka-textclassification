            When I received my Digital Camera, it was a blessing in disguise.  The DC210 is small, silver, and a big battery drain.  It takes 4 AA batteries, which do not last much past 30 pictures.  You can determine the quality of the pictures, but the better the pictures, the shorter life span of the batteries.  I chose the medium, but have moved away from taking pictures with the batteries.  Instead I use the ac adapter (which is included.) Mostly, we use the camera to take pictures of items to auction off on EBAY.  The camera is so simple to use, I feel bad that I have not really taught my wife to use it.  Our pictures come out great!  They transfer to the computer via a serial cable, also included.  When I take pictures of the family, the quality is good enough that when they are printed on photo paper, they look like enlarged photographs.  The camera has an auto focus option, a digital viewscreen, and anti redeye.  It also comes with software to allow you to edit pictures, build your own digital scrapbooks, and make cards.  <br><br>
