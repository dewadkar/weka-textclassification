            This car has one of the smoothest rides ever. I owned a used Infiniti Q45, about 4 years old when I purchased it. I had no problems with the car. It was an amazing step up from my last car.  The leather was comfortable and the back seat was very roomy. There is more than enough room for three people in the back.  The front seats were automatic and changed to the specific persons' settings when you click the button. I love this car and wish that I had never given it to my mother! I would recommend this amazing piece of machinery to anyone looking for an amazing new ride.  

The Infiniti company and dealers take care of their customers, when you take it to get fixed, they supply you with another Infiniti! Riding in any of the Infinitis is a privilege for me and I love every aspect of them.  Infiniti provides a wonderful Bose stereo system that has an awesome sound!<br><br>
