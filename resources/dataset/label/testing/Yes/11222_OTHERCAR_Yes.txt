            We traded in our older car for the Chrysler Town & Country LXi about six months ago.  So far, we couldn't be more pleased with our purchase.  It's surprisingly easy to drive and to handle despite it's size, and the added safety features such as ABS and air bags are something that ease my mind greatly considering that we're expecting our first child any day now.  The only real drawback we've noticed is that when the air conditioning is running, the van loses a LOT of it's power, however it seems to get it back relatively quickly.  It's been great on road trips and handled nicely in both snowy and rainy conditions.  The fact that it has two sliding doors has added so much convenience, not to mention that with the seats being able to easily remove-- storage space and transporting large purchases has been a breeze.  I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone who is starting out a family, because it didn't just have all of the extras we were were looking for, it had MORE!  Definitely worth what we paid for it, and I've experienced none of the problems I've read on the other reviews.  Another great plus is the comfort level... even at nine months pregnant, I'm perfectly comfortable getting in and out and feel quite content when we're out and about.
