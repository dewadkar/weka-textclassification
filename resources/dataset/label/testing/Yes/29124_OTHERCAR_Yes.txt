            My Hubby has a 1999 Toyota Tacoma, 4x4 mini cab and this is his second one we have owned we also owned a 1998 model without mini cab and I can tell you it is the nicest truck we have owned ever. We love Toyota brand and stand by them the most. His job was alot of city driving and he had to go to muddy job sites in his field of work and his truck never failed him ever, gas mileage , comfort was the absolute best.
We are wanting to purchase a new 2000 Tundra just because of our wonderful experience with Toyota people and there dealers have all been a second place we feel comfortable in, especially when we are in that purchase mode , i can honestly say we have been treated with alot of respect from the Toyota dealers we have been to see. The are always curtious kind and very willing to please us.
My hubbys truck is a dark green color with grey interior and very nicely put together. We have been owners of our truck for almost a yr now and are very pleased.
thanks Toyota.<br><br>
