            We have owned an explorer for 8 years and will buy one again.  We have found it to be extremely dependable.  We use it for work and pleasure.  The one thing you must understand is that my husbands idea of pleasure is the out back.  I do mean the out back.  We have taken the explorer where no man has gone before.  It climbs like a charm.  

 We find that it handles ice and snow great.  There have been times when our explorer was the only vehicle on the roads.  We live in a rural area and most of our neighbors have 4 wheel drives but not an explorer.  We have pulled many a neighbor out of the ditch line after a snow storm.  They are all impressed with our explorer.  

Gas economy is good.  There is plenty of room for hauling camping equipment.  The head room is excellent.  My husband is 6'4&quot; and loves to wear a hat.  So it is very important for him to have head room.  

Anyone who has to travel in snow should own an explorer.  I never miss work with the explorer.  Now that is something to boast about.  I am a home health nurse who goes from home to home all winter long in a rural mountainous area.  Many of our clients do not live on the main roads and if it was not for my explorer they would not be seen.  I can not rave enough about my explorer.<br><br>
