            After years of living with a celluloid world we decided to leap to digital.  Cost (Under $500) vs. Ease of use/Quality of picture was the main concern.  After a month of searches and comparisons the Kodak DC240 became the prime target.  

The first impression of the camera is a solid, well built unit.  All controls are in a reasonably logical location and use push buttons instead of a wobble disk as found on other makes.  Kodak kept the average user in mind with easy to understand manuals and built-in menus.  Navigation around the menu screens does not take a flow chart to understand.  Cute little icons are also used as well as a choice of seven languages to give an international flair.  

The picture producing part is the fun part though.  Six levels of quality/resolution are allowed which give a total of 20 to 120 shots on the 8Mb compactflash card.  These levels can be mixed on the card and allow, say, 60 low resolution shots mixed with 10 taken at high resolution.  The macro is easy to use if a person needs to get within a 10&quot; to 20&quot; range.  Also, on macro, the LCD display is on to frame the shot.  When taking a picture, the button is depressed partway to allow the camera to focus and lock on target.  This can be a little different to get used to after using 35MM SLR's with manual focus.  Zoom is 3X optical and 2X digital.  We haven't printed out any pictures at full zoom but they do look nice on the computer, would be great to send over the web.

Software provided installs easily and quickly.  We are using the Serial Port at the moment but will be switching to the USB feature in the near future.  I recommend getting an AC adapter to keep the batteries in reserve.  40 pictures taken and downloaded used up most of the capacity of the rechargable NiMH cells provided with the camera.  The

On a scale of 10 I would rate this camera about 8.5.  Like I said, if you are used to a 35MM SLR type camera this is not quite as easily manipulated.  On the otherhand, for the point and shooters or casual snappers, this is an excellent move into the world of digital photography.  Once setup to your liking it is mostly a point and shoot affair.  <br><br>
