            I bought my 2003 F250 XL SuperCab 6 months ago- my first brand new truck.  Dark Shadow Grey, 2x4, SuperCab, Long bed...I love this truck!  The guys just drool when I show it to them.  The most common comment I hear is "a girl that owns this truck has gotta be cool!"

All I can say is that trucks have come a long way!  I had a 1993 F250 that I purchased used.  It rode like a truck, it drove like a truck and it felt like a truck.  My new truck doesnt feel uncomfortable to drive, as a matter of fact, sometimes I forget I am even in truck.  

It is fairly quiet, it rides pretty smoothly and it is nice and roomy!  Three adults easily fit in the front seat and 3 child carseats fit with plenty of room in the back.  Back seat is a 60/40 split with option to fold one or both sides.  Easily hauls around 6 people, although the leg room in the back is a little lacking.  I love these half doors though, and the back seats folded up it makes a great storage area or area for the dogs (I have a great dane and a bloodhound- and even they have lots of room!)  It is so much easier than having to climb over front seats to get to the back.  The suicide doors can be a little tricky in crowded parking lots, but they can make it pretty easy to manuver large objects into the back and load the kids up.  The long bed is great for hauling around furniture, hay, the dogs, even my miniature horses and the truck tows a trailer like a dream.

I bought the base model, so although it has auto trans and air, it is pretty bare bones beyond that. I would have liked a seat tilt adjustment, cruise control and a better stereo, but otherwise, this model is ok with me (and I can always buy a new stereo!).  I even like the vinyl floors rather than carpet because they are easier to clean and I dont worry about muddy boots or dogs.  The back tailgate has a key lock on it which is a nice piece of added security especially if you have a shell.

Control panel is fairly well designed.  The windshield wiper control is a little hard to get the knack of due to a plethera of possible settings (a little tricky to figure out in the dark) but in general everything is set pretty conveniently and reachable.  2 different A/C levels with 4 settings each cool the cab down quickly, and the heater warms just as quickly.  There is a handy feature of being able to disable the passenger side airbag with the turn of a key, great if the back seat area is full and the kids need to ride in front.  3 different dome lights controls have also come in handy.  A neat cup holder slides out and adjusts to fit almost any size cup- from juice boxes to Big Gulps!

The actual performance of the truck has been very good.  It has a pretty quick acceleration, smooth shifting, and handles well.  I feel it has a good amount of visability while driving due to large windows and large foldable double mirrors which extend for added visability while towing and hauling.  Speaking of towing and hauling- even with the bed fully loaded and towing a trailer with 2 tons of hay, this truck handles very well- extremely responsive and as always the brakes performed well keeping everything under control.  The engine itself is quiet enough from inside the cab that I dont even notice it while driving.           

The 2 worst things I can say about it are: 
1- crappy turning radius!  I have a hard time in some parking lots and pulling out of drive-thrus sometimes.
2- the gas mileage stinks!!  I know- part of owning a truck-but it costs me $50 to fill up and I get about 430 miles- thats about 13-14mpg in the city.

I leaned towards the Ford over Chevy or Dodge because I had a lease to trade in and wanted out of it early, but after driving them all, I still like the Ford the best.  I actually had a bigger debate between choosing an F150 or F250.  I dont regret getting the base model 250 over the more equipped 150 because the F250 is just so much more truck!  I wanted more power for towing, and the F250 definitely looks bigger and badder!  I feel so cool driving this truck!  Not only do I love the power, I feel safe in it too.  I own the road with this truck!
