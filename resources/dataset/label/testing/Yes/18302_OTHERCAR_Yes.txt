            This is my second Dodge Ram, the first being a 1997 150 with a 360 engine.This one is a 2000 250 model. The 1997 was a wonderful truck. It rode and handled like a car but was definately a truck when it came to pulling a trailer. The new 2000 is a 250 with the V-10 engine and automatic. I purchased it because I was so pleased with the 1997. With only 900 miles on the new truck I am a little disappointed. The paint, all black, is not a very good job. The roof is dull with a number of dirt particles imbedded in the paint. There are a number on dirt particles on the hood and doors also. After only a couple of hundred miles the front end has developed a loud squeak and the dealer has not rectified the problem. The transmission has an intermittent shifting problem that the dealer cannot diagnose. But for hauling and pulling, I don't think it can be beat. A 2800 lb. trailer doesn't even slow it down one bit and it pulls without sway or other annoying gyrations. Overall I like the truck and if the dealer repairs my problems, I may begin to like it more. And the V-10 is an awesome cruising motor. It will run at any speed you want up to over 100 MPH and it just seems to be loafing. I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants or needs a powerful truck for pulling trailers. If you want a better ride and don't need the heavy pulling power, stick with the 150 with the 360 engine.It will pull almost any trailer.<br><br>
