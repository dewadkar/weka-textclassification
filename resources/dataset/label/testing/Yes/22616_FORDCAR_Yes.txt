            I got my T-bird for my graduation present, and it did great for me.  My sister drives it right now.  That's a tells me that its a really great car to survive her mistreatments after I had driven it for three years.  The 4.6L V8 as pumped up as it could be, but this is not a Mustang.  This makes the engine much more reliable and it still offers neck popping power that will pass any eighteen wheel like its standing still.  The gas mileage isn't bad either (for a V8).  I consistently got 25-27 mpg while averaging 70 mph on the way home from school and back.  

My only complaints about the car are the big doors which do not make the back seat any easier to access.  One of those swingout doors like on the saturn coupe would have come in handy.  I also wish that the back seat would fold down. This would have made an already generous trunk even more useful.  This feature would have made moving home after my freshman year much easier; however, I still managed to fit all of my belongings in the car.

My only problem with the car is a defective sensor that told me to take the car in for service.  Other than that, all you need to do is make sure that the oil is changed, the tires and brakes are good, and the fluids are in check.<br><br>
