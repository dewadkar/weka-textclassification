            I purchased my blazer in 94, when i was expecting my first child.  I bought the blazer for the safety features.  The steel beams all around, the shatter protection in the windows. My blazer has been wrecked 2 times.  I was rear-ended shortly after I bought it, no injuries and no damage.  The second time, my two children were with me. The lady hit us on the drivers side, her vehicle had to be towed, the blazer had a small dent on the front drivers side, we drove away with no injuries and minimal damage.  It still runs like a new truck, with 130,000 miles on it.  It has great traction and control in snow and ice. Only routine maintenance had been done up until two years ago, i have had to replace a few parts.  On the downside, the parts on a blazer are on the expensive side.  
I love driving this vehicle, it drives very smooth.  The back is roomy enough for sleeping, i have even camped in this vehicle.  The seats are comfortable.  I would recommend this truck for anyone.  Its great with kids, the ease of getting them in and out, loading their things in the back makes for convenience when traveling, and there is enough room in the back seat, so far no fighting on trips:).  For the teens, it is sporty, it is good on gas mileage.  Its good purchase for anyone who hauls things, travels, and likes having plenty of room when driving/riding.    <br><br>
