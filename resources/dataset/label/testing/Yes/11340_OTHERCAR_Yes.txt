            We rented one of the 1999 models over thanksgiving. We have a car that just barley holds the 5 of us so we needed this for company. Im here to tell you we loved it. We did not want to return it. We had 7 people in it. A double stroller. Tons of packages, and still had plenty of room. The sliding doors that open on both sides are such a wonderful convienence. it drove like a dream and the gas milage was wonderful. We plan on purchasing one of these in the very near future. Dodge did a wonderful job with the Grand caravan. We give it 2 thumbs up!<br><br>
