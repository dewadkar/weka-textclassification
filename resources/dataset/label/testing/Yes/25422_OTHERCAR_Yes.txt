                 I bought the Saturn because I had heard so many great things about the Saturn Company and the service given after the sale.  I have not been disappointed.  The service staff seem to take pride in their work and the Saturn Company always notifies me when it is time for service.  The service department staff are very friendly and helpful.   Since I have had no mechanical problems with the car, my few experiences with the staff have been for service only, which was fast and competent.  

    The Saturn SC 1 is a fun little car to drive.   However, when I say "little" I do mean "little".   There is not much room inside and if you are carrying more than one adult along with you, expect the adults in the back seat to be uncomfortable.  The seats in the back dip down in the center, therefore sitting in the back seat is like sitting in a bucket.  Plus there is not much room for an adult to shift around in the back seat to attempt to get comfortable.  When an adult tries to adjust themselves in the back seat, they find themselves sinking back into the bucket.  

     Another problem I have noted with the Saturn SC is a blind spot.  When changing lanes (especially moving into a right lane) it is very difficult to see if the lane is clear.   I have to lean over to glance back to make sure there are no cars in this blind spot.

This Saturn came equipped with Firestone FR680 tires.  Now, I know that Firestone has had it problems lately but the FR680 was not on the list of their problem tires.  However, I hate these tires.  Two of the four tires have constantly lost air.   About once a week you will find me at the Amoco air compressor measuring pressure and pumping up these two tires.  If I forget to do this, people in other cars are waving and pointing at my tires to warn me that they are low. 

The overhead light in this car is not sturdily installed.  My son's friend was climbing into the back seat and bumped the overhead light.  One of the plastic tabs on the light popped off and now this light is hanging out on its wires.  It swings and sways as I drive around.  I have tried (in vain) to fix this light but since the plastic tab is broken, it just falls back out.  I wish that it was more firmly attached with a screw or bolt.  

I like the paint job on the Saturn because it is very resiliant.  It doesn't scratch easily.  The only scratch I have on mine is where someone either intentionally, or just pure meanness, shoved a car door against the passenger side of my car.  They had to have shoved it very hard to scratch the paint the way they did.  They even left some of their car's paint on it.  The scratch buffed up rather well but it is still pretty noticeable.

     Another nice thing about the Saturn is the gas mileage.   It seems to go on forever on a tank of gas.  I currently get an average of 35 miles to the gallon but have gotten up to 40 miles per gallon (and with the price of gas now that really helps).  

A helpful feature of the Saturn SC is that the trunk is larger than I thought it would be.  I had purchased a floor lamp and the box it was in was long and tall.   All I had to do was fold down one of the back seats and this extended the trunk area into the interior of the car.   This feature makes hauling larger items much easier.   It is also helpful on trips when we need to get something out of the trunk, my son (riding in the back seat) can fold down one side of the seat back and reach into the trunk to get that item out.  

     The Saturn also has a great sounding stereo system. Two speakers in the doors and two speakers behind the back seats.   The radio adjustments are easy to use and easy to reach.  This makes the drive even more enjoyable.  
  
     I love my Saturn...the biggest problem is ....so do my kids.   :-|

Thank y'all for reading.
