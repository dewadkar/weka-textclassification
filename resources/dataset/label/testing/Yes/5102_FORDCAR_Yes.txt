            I like my Taurus. It's been serving me faithfully for the past two years, since I bought it used, a '97, with 18,000 miles on it. However, the interior doesn't like me much. 

I'm 6' 4&quot;, and the inside of my car really wants me to be 6', maybe 6' 2&quot;, at the very most. The back of the sear is convex where it should be concave, and concave where it should be convex. The armrest on the door is 1.5 inches too low and so is the middle armrest. The cumulative result is that I hunch just slightly, not enough to be slouching comfortable, soft-style, just enough to feel like Quasimodo whenever I get where I'm going. 

To add insult to injury, the configuration of the seat in relation to the pedals and the steering wheel results in me either being too far from the steering wheel or having my legs folded uncomfortably under the dash. 

It pains me not only literally but in a figurative sense that the Taurus is so poorly suited to my physique. I don't think that being 6' 4&quot; is so unusual as it may have been in the past, since average heights in North America continue to increase, and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a rather large 4 door sedan to fit someone my height. If the Taurus was substandard in other ways it would be easier to bear, but the truth is everything else I've experienced with this car has been quite positive, from the performance to the reliability to the value. Just not the comfort. *sigh*<br><br>
