            With the birth of our third child we decided our little car just wasn't going to sufficient for our needs.  We decided that we were going to get a minivan and had the opportunity through a &quot;Car Wars&quot; event that we were able to look at and evaluate just about every type of minivan available.  We were totally impressed with the Caravan compared to the other vans offered.  After driving it and talking about the price... we were sold... 3 days later we were the proud owners of a Dodge Caravan.  We have had it three years now and have only a few minor problems with it.  <br><br>
