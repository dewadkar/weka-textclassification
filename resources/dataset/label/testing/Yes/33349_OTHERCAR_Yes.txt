            Yeah a friend of mine had just purchased a brand new 99 nissan pathfinder fully loaded. This suv offers you a good amount of power, comfort throughout the entire vehicle, and it is very stylish which is a plus these days because nobody wants an ugly car like JEROME. The handeling on this car could be better it rolls a little bit in the turns but overall handles very good. The engine on this suv is not as powerful as its competition like the cherokee or the blazer or explorer but this suv rides more like a car and is easier to drive and offers you more comfort than the others. Anyone out there looking for a new or used suv i would have to say make sure you look at the nissan pathfinder i am sure you wont be dissapointed.<br><br>
