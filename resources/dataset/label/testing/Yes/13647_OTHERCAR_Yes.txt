            The Kia Sportage is very reasonably priced in the smaller sports utility vehicle class.  For a family with a 6 foot 5 husband and a five year old is offers great headroom and packing space.  The pick up and gas mileage is surprisingly good for this inexpensive model vehicle.  

The downside of this vehicle is that the trunk or back hatch control which has frequently been used by us has had to replaced twice.  This is not a tragedy but the Kia dealers in the Westchester area frequently do not have replacement parts available and the wait is quite inconvenient.  This has been true as well with brake pads.

Kia does not offer a roadside assistance plan after you reach 36000 miles and do not notify you that you are no longer covered by their plan like so many other car companies.<br><br>
