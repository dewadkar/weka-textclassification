            AI was recently allowed a short stint in the driver's seat of a 1999 Ferrari 360 Modena.  This was the 6 speed manual version, not the hotter and more expensive F1 (paddle shift).  Since it was someone else's car (and he was with me), I stayed away from my normal powershift test drive tactics and paid more attention to the subtle characteristics the car displayed.

Of course, there are several MAJOR things that people think of when they think of Ferraris - speed, sound, and looks - and the 360 Modena has all of that.  With a SCREAMING redline close to five digits, you may run out of courage before the engine does.  Getting up to speed is easy enough, just plant your right foot into the deep pile carpet, BUT watch out for that gated shifter - it's a little tricky to get right the first few times.

As I said, I didn't do any right-foot-stays-planted powershifts, but I was still able to explore the acceleration properties of the car to some extent.  On a nearby local highway, we surprised quite a few travellers as we cruised by well into the triple digit range.  I was very pleased with how quickly the car turned up the revs.  It felt like I needed to shift every time I looked at the tach!  Keep in mind that there is NO getting away from attention in this car, EVERYONE will suddenly forget that staring is rude, and some will even forget to wipe the drool off their chins.

I actually found myself laughing outloud as we sat at a few intersections.  People blatantly staring, pointing, smiling, and a few scoffing and scowling (jealous!) - it's just not something that happens every day unless you are one of the lucky few to own one of these cars.

I'm not sure if I'll have a chance to drive this one again, I probably put 30-50 precious miles on it (out of the 2000 or so total miles it has so far) and that might be my only chance.  But I have the memory of that exhaust wail that will never leave me to remind me about the awesome drive!<br><br>
