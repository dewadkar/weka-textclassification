            My husband refused to be seen in a mini van, but we have 3 boys and a car wouldn't work for us.  We leased a 1996 suburban, and love it.  The thing is HUGE and seats 9 with lots of storage space.   For such a large vehicle it drives very well and once you're used to it, it doesn't feel big at all- it handles just as easily as a car. Actually, I feel so much safer when I'm driving my suburban than in anything else I've ever owned that I'm really glad we got it.  It's the greatest on family road trips, we have space to bring everyone and everything with us without feeling cramped.  We love it so much that we paid off our lease and are going to keep it.  Ours is loaded, leather seats, Cd player, 4 wheel drive etc. and we have had no mechanical problems and are at 60,000 miles.  My only complaints are that it only gets about 15-17 miles per gallon and the parking lot spaces are never big enough.........
