            It has been many many years since I bought a new vehicle, so of course I wanted something affordable, durable and can fit a family of 5.  Of course I was spoiled having a conversion van, but the gas mileage and frequent electrical problems pushed us to buy another vehicle.

We search for almost a year on something that would fit our family, within our price range and had a good reputation.  Hyundai was not the first thing that came to mind.  We decided to look around, but everything we were looking for seemed to be in the Hyundai Sonata.

With all our options and our trade-in we paid around $14,000.  We got the 10 yr 100,000 mile warranty, not many cars can beat that.  We compared to Saturn (which I also liked), but for some reason I couldn't get their song out of my mind.  Yeah, it seems trivial, but I can't bear to hum the same song every time I'm driving down the road.

I like the 60/40 split seats, it has helped me on many occasions.  I was used to a noisy van, so the peace and quiet of this car was a nice change.  However the shape of the trunk unfortunately limits how much you can pack in.  My family and I travel, and pack a lot of stuff.  More trunk room the better.  

We have owned our Hyundai for 1 1/2 yrs, have never had a problem, and currently am living in Italy with it.  I would recommend the Sonata to anyone looking for a good car at a good price.

The biggest drawback is my kids can touch each other!  If you have kids, you'll understand what I mean.  But unfortunately, I haven't found a vehicle yet that can separate siblings far enough for a peaceful ride.
