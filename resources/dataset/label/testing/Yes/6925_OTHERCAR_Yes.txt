            Wow. I am very amazed at what the manufactures at HONDA are putting on the market. The all new Honda Insight is the best. It has the best fuel efficiency I have ever seen from a car. And it has a clever and unique design to it. The interior design is very cute. It resembles the Honda CRX in many ways. The rear end, the interior design. The rear seats (there are none), and the overall design of the car. Although the CRX gives off a lot more horsepower. <br>The use of this vehicles engine is very unique and different from the ways other electrical powered vehicles run. No more going to the mall and driving around the parking lot, trying to find an outlet to plug your electrical car into. The Insight builds up its electrical power as it brakes. Please do not get it mixed up with &quot;breaks&quot; because you won't see that for this car. The handling of the car is very good and sharp. Under the hood, you will find a 1.0L VTEC engine combined with an electric motor. This car gets up to 70 miles per gallon. Whoa! That means that I can save more money on gas. If you are looking for a very sporty and powerful car that is a gasoline gulper, I would not really recommend this car. The Insight gives off about 75 horsepower. While the 1991 Honda CRX Si gives off about 108 horsepower. <br><br>There are a couple things that I dislike about his car though.Those rear fender-guards just have to go, or else it is going to be pretty hard for the owner to wash the car (esp. wheels). And the dealerships expect me to pay about twenty grand for a car that gets good MPG but only gives off 75 horsepower. Gosh...75 horsepower, think about it. I mean, I can find a CRX that gets about 42 MPG (pretty good fuel efficiency) for about four times less the price of the Insight. And the CRX has a lot more horsepower. I am not trying to say that I do not like the Insight. It is just that I expect more power for my money. <br><br>Overall, I really like the Honda Insight.  If you really care about the environment, and need a reliable car, I highly recommend this car to you. I like this car because it stands out in a crowd. If you are looking for a cute and convenient automobile, you should look into the Honda Insight because I highly recommend it.<br><br><br>
