            I bought a '92 Protege used in '95. I traded it in a few years ago for ... yes... another Protege! The '92 had over 140,000 miles on it and it was still purring like a kitten so I knew that another Protege would last me.

I checked out a few other cars. The Nissan Sentra was really nice looking, but I felt like I was riding a turtle when pulling out into the busy road from the dealership. No Get up and Go at all. The price was comparable though, and the salesman was a good friend of mine. I almost bought it...but I kept coming back to the fact that I just didn't feel safe when the car didn't have to power to get out into traffic. 

The Chevy Malibu was another car that I really liked. It looked cool and the fact that they were bringing that car back out gave it that nostalgic sense of a classic. Even though the car looked nothing like the old Malibus it had it's own style going for it. The price was a little higher than I really liked but I still considered it. I didn't get it because for once in my life when I pulled onto a lot, got out, and looked at this car, there were no salesmen to be seen. I even had my military uniform on, and those dealers love to see that because they know we have a decent steady paycheck. Besides if we don't make our payments we get in trouble with our commanders (and you don't want to do that) So, alas, no Malibu for me. If they don't want to get up off their duffs and help me out (I could actually see them in the window of the dealership talkin away to eachother)then no business from me!

Dodge Stratus.. now that was a sleek looking car. I found one that had everything that I wanted on it but cruise control. That was a must for me! They wanted 16,600 for it so it was quite a bit further out of my price range. Sleek lookin car though but I decided to go back to the Mazda dealership and try it out one more time.

Here I am pulling up in my '92 Protege stepping out onto the lot and a salesman steps right up to me to help me out. He noticed that I had a Mazda already and was looking to trade it in.

I checked out some '98's but they were a little choppy in the suspension...(I like a smoother ride...don't want to know that I am going over every little crack on these horrible Louisiana roads.) On to the '99's. Woo Hoo... what pep! I jumped right out into traffic with this one. It set me back in my seat! It felt like I was driving a little Go-Kart! I definitely liked the ride...very smooth! I liked it but I hadn't found one that caught my eye until...

There it was... sitting in the back of the lot...not even been there a full day. Shipping stickers still on it. A dark almost midnight blue '99 Protege LX manual transmission. Moonroof (a must), power locks (keyless entry), CD player, dual airbags, reinforced doors and crash zones, seats 5 comfortably, split seats with shoulder straps on all 3, adjustable height straps in the front, and...cruise control... YES! There were only two things that sucked about it...

1.) It had beige interior on a dark blue car...YUCK.
2.) There was beige pinstripe to match the interior...YUCK!

Ok so I can live with the interior, but the pinstripe had to go. I just told them to take it off and they did. It actually took off $75.00. Not a lot but still just have em take it off if it is ugly.

I have been driving it since I bought it new. Over 3 years now. I have never had so much fun in a car til now. It gets great gas mileage. (340 miles in the city and sometimes 400 miles on the highway for one tank of gas!) I love the moonroof and I have gotten nothing but compliments on how it looks and drives. It really is a sporty little car. You would be amazed at how a moonroof wind deflector can change the look of your vehicle. The trunk is so huge!!! I have moved 3 times and all 3 times it has carried quite a bit.. big boxes even! The CD player even plays MP3 files! Not many CD players are compatable, but this one is!

The tires have just been replaced on it (I am bad on tires). I have put on almost 40K in the past 3 years and I couldn't be more pleased with it's performance. 

It has only one downfall as far as I am concerned... When you are trying to get up speed and you have the AC running it drains form the cars power just enough to notice. 

Other than that it is a virtually maintenance free smooth ride that is affordable and sporty!
