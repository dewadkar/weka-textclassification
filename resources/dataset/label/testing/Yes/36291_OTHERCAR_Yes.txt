            I have previously been looking on BMW 3 and 5-series cars as a future choice for transportation. Then I heard that the Nissan Skyline would be introduced to the US market as an Infiniti G35 with a 3.5-liter V6...

Recently, there&#146s been a lot of buzz in automotive publications like &#147Car and Driver&#148 and &#147MotorTrend&#148, including comparisons with BMW 330 and Cadillac CTS, which the G35 won.

It was definitely time for a test drive. So I test drove the silver G35 with black leather interior over the weekend. But let me first tell you what I want in a car and what the G35 delivers and where it falls short.

<b>Requirements:</b>
1. Safety. Although many car manufacturers try to convince you that their cars are &#147safe&#148, the crash test show that number of airbags and the level of sophistication of the technical jargon used do not directly translate into real safety. The G35 was crash-tested in Japan as Nissan Skyline and got high marks.

The G35 features front, side and head air bags as well as belt pretentioners and force limiters. In addition to this, the brakes are very strong and handling aided by Vehicle Stability Control is excellent.

2. Design. The G35 is unconventional in terms of design inside and out. I think I am getting used to its exterior styling, but the interior looks a bit cheap.

3. Performance. The 3.5-liter engine with 260 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque is easily the most powerful in its class and for the money. The braking is excellent, with stops from 60 or 70 mph rivaling cars like Ferrari and Porsche. Handling is also excellent (see below).

4. Price. Both Luxury (cloth interior) and Luxury Leather models are very aggressively priced and have base MSRPs under $30K nicely equipped.

5. Size. The G35 is larger than its competition (based on price) like BMW 330, Audi A4, etc.

6. Rear-wheel drive for better acceleration, handling and weight distribution. 

7. Warranty and Reliability. The Infinity cars are known for their reliability and G35 has <i>48-month/60,000-mile</i> full warranty with roadside assistance and <i>72-month/70,000-mile</i> powertrain warranty.

8. Service. Infinity is also known for good service, free loaner car when your car is in service. Plus, they have no-pressure sales practices.

The list goes on&#133 Basically, for $29,000 (Luxury Leather) you can get a mid-size rear-wheel drive car with 3.5-liter V6 engine rated at 260 hp, 5-speed automatic transmission, interesting styling and zero-lift (in front) aerodynamics and low drag coefficient.

It will have 17&#148 alloy wheels, 215mm V-rated tires and top speed of around 145 mph. Various car magazines evaluated the 0-60 time at around 6.2 seconds and quarter-mile below 15 seconds.

You can find more interesting specs elsewhere, below I will concentrate on my impressions.

<b>Test Drive</b>

First of all, I would like to express my delight with Infinity dealerships (at least the ones I have been to). When I got there, there was no pressure to buy a car (the way you get treated when you set you foot on the showroom floor of, say, Ford dealership).

The dealer (Michael) showed me some of the features of the car. Again, he didn&#146t show me all of the features, just the basic ones (unlike a guy at the Honda dealership we went to, who spent a lot of time showing us a locking gas filler door and such).

Then we drove the car. There is a 15-mph 90-degree curve in the neighborhood, through which I was easily be able to go at 40+ mph. I could feel the Vehicle Stability Control system working to keep me on course &#150 there is a slight perceivable vibration when the system brakes wheels individually.

The brakes are very effective, although they are a little &#147touchy&#148 &#150 the intensive deceleration starts immediately after you put your foot on the brake pedal. The acceleration is quick, although not as quick as the BMW 540 I drove a while ago. But the BMW 540 starts at $55K&#133

There is not much body roll in turns, acceleration or braking. And remember &#150 this is the car, which had no optional Sport Package&#133 The turning radius is quite impressive for the car of this size.

By the way, the A/C is very powerful and it got really cold inside the car fast. The climate control temperature can be adjusted separately for each of the front passengers if you have Premium Package.

<b>Interior</b>

The car&#146s interior is available in Graphite (black) or Willow and features some aluminum-look accents. The base model comes with Willow cloth only, the Leather model can be bought with either Graphite or Willow (I think that Graphite looks much better).

The interior is non-conventional, starting with the gauge cluster that moves with the steering wheel when you adjust its tilt and including, but not limited to, two small glove boxes one above another.

The in-dash 6-CD changer is standard equipment as is the auto climate control and power front seats. There are controls on the steering wheel for the audio system on the Leather model.

The steering wheel is small and the steering is sensitive and communicative. The gearshift lever can be moved to the separate gate to the right for manual shifting (why not to the left?).

The remote control has a button that allows you remotely open the windows on the hot day. The Infiniti signature analog clock in the middle of the dash adds an elegant and original touch.

<b>What&#146s Not So Cool</b>

Above I described what is very cool and somewhat cool about the G35. Now, it is time for not-so-cool stuff.

First of all, I find that the Willow interior looks much worse than Graphite. Because of this, I cannot even consider the base model (Luxury) &#150 it can only be had with Willow cloth. I wish there was an option to get Graphite cloth &#150 leather interiors in Southern California get hot quickly, plus I would like to save some animals.

Interior can be improved. A lot has been said by others about the power seat controls, that are close to cup holders and not intuitive to use. I found them to be a non-issue in terms of location &#150 I virtually never drink anything in my car while driving, so there is not much chance of anything being spilled on the controls. And I don&#146t find them to affect my butt either, the way some people do.  However, they could have been better arranged so that the control would be more intuitive.

The instrument cluster has a display for the current gear ratio, but I find the lighting to be not easy on one&#146s eyes &#150 I would rather prefer black background and yellow symbols. But instead there is yellow background and black (gray?) symbols. Not cool. Also, the yello lighting of the instruments reflects into the upper portion of the windshield, which is annoying at night.

Then, you have to get some options to be able to get others. From Infiniti web site, it seems that you have to get Premium Package to be able to get pretty much anything. Navigation system is not available without Premium Package, etc. This is not cool.

Also, you seem to be able to get Xenon headlights as a separate option on CarsDirect.com, but if you try to configure the car on Infiniti web site, it complains, saying you need Premium Package... I asked Michael and he said that Xenons can be had separately, but I am not sure if he is right.

Next is the transmission. The manual transmission is not offered yet, but should be available early next year. Hopefully the manual-equipped cars will be cheaper than automatics.

The back seats don&#146t fold &#150 there is only a ski pass-through. The twin glove boxes only make sense when you get navigation system, in which case the upper glove box is taken by electronics.

<b>Conclusion</b>

The G35 is a bargain and I will definitely be getting one. The question is if I am going to get the sedan or the upcoming coupe and if it is going to be manual or auto transmission. For such a low price, it is a great value in terms of features, safety and performance.
