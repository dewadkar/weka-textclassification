               I am the proud owner of a new GMC Sierra.  However, I learned to drive in a 1985 Buick Park Avenue Electra.  I miss my car...

   My love affair began with Buick when, in the 7th grade, I became too darn big to fit in the back seat of my mother's '78 Pontiac.  No kidding, right?  Thus, my parents traded in the Grand Prix for the new(er) Buick.  

   There is nothing &quot;near luxury&quot; about it.  It was like driving a living room around.  It had power everything, a/c, cassette am/fm, etc.  Loaded to the gills.  I must say that I did experience some problems with the power windows losing the ability to &quot;move,&quot; but that was essentially the only problem I had.

   Not to mention that it drove smoother than any other car I have ever driven.  Couple that with the fact that it was virtually impossible to lose control, and you got a serious driving machine!  When I was 16, my mother made me drive her to work in it because there was an ice storm, and her sissy little Grand Am would most likely slide off the road.  Not my Park!

   Oh yeah... That part about the roominess... Trust me on this.  (Wink, wink...)

   On the night of my 20th birthday, I was driving home with my girlfriend for cake with the parents when a careless individual decided to see if they could drive their Escort POS &quot;through&quot; my lovely car.  The &quot;Hooptie&quot; lost it's life that night.  (No humans were injured, other than I was insanely P.O.'d)  At that point, I began driving trucks, which are more conducive to my work habits, anyways.  

   Know this, though.... When the time is right, Buick, I am coming for my new Park Ave..........<br><br>
