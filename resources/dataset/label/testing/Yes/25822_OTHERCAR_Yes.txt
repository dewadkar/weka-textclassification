            As I work with large format graphics, the biggest attraction was the 6 megapixel count. The ability to hold up to enlargements was nice, and not having to shell out for a full blown Digital SLR with lens helped in the decision. 

I especially like the option of using the LCD on the back or through the viewfinder. The quick look of what you shot also is a nice bonus. Picture quality is equally great indoors or out. And the fast recovery time between shots is also quite nice!

The fact that the camera uses AA batteries is also nice. I've had my old camera batteries die, and not being able to recharge it instantly has caused a problem from time to time. Using rechargable AA batteries is something to consider, though, as you need the LCD / electronic viewfinder at all times (There isn't a standard viewfinder)

If you're just a point and shooter needing high resolution, then I would select this camera. It is very easy to use, and produces nice images just left on "auto" The "prosumer" will also like the additional control over exposure, the option of using an external flash  and some nice advanced features, like ISO film speeds up to 800. Plus, it has a nice feel for folks accustomed to using SLR cameras. 

The AVI movie feature was an added bonus that has audio input as well. This did not factor into my purchase decision, but it will come in handy.

I haven't found anything I don't like about this camera. My first digital was a Fuji MX 700, and I couldn't be happier with the continued quality of this brand
