            One of the best cars I ever owned! Great mileage and performance.
Fully loaded the comfort nearly equals the living room
sofa with added extras like recline and heat for those
cold mornings. It also has optional heated mirrors and
if you live anywhere it snows you know how nice that can be.
  Several down falls however. First; the smell of diesel
which takes some getting used to. Second I don't know how
common this is but for the diesel the only repair shop
I could find was a dealer. Third and last were the rubber
boots on the fuel injector lines. Once one goes they all
tend to follow my dealer didn't carry them but did know where 
to get them.
  If you don't mind putting anti-gel in your fuel tank
and plugging it in every night so the glow plugs will
work when it's cold outside you'll like this car.
