            I bought my 1997 Accord used in November 1998.  It is fully loaded.  There are many things I like about this car, and a few things I dislike:

My Accord has a V6 which I find to be much peppier than other V6 cars.  The acceleration is great, however the automatic transmission isn't exactly smooth.  It is very obvious when the gears are shifting.  I find the ride to be pretty quiet, which I like because I always have CD's or the radio playing.  The driver's seat is quite comfortable to sit in, although sometimes my legs feel cramped no matter how I adjust the seat.  And I'm only 5'6".  The back seat is very cramped.  I wouldn't recommend this car if you will have people riding in the back seat often.  
My Accord has leather seats which have held up remarkably well in the scorching Arizona sun.  They are very easy to clean.  One big complaint I do have about my Accord is the air conditioning system.  It takes a good 30 minutes for the AC to blow very cold air in the summertime.  Once it gets cold, its cold, but it takes a long time to cool off. 
Another complaint is the paint on the hood.  Is is beginning to crack and craze.  I know the AZ sun is hard on cars, but the paint should hold up longer than that!
I find the Accord's trunk space to be quite roomy for a small car.  
My Accord has never left me stranded, although twice in the past 7 months I've had to take it into the shop to have the timing reset.  Apparently condensation formed on the spark plugs because I started the car, drove it about 20 feet, and shut it off.  This causes the car to idle roughly and sputter the next time you start it.  I know starting and shutting a car off is bad, but come on, its still a pretty new car!
