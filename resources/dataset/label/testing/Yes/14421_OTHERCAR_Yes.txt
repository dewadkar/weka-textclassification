            My family and I just bought a '97 Dakota SLT.  I have to admit, it is nice, rather roomy, and has a nice quiet ride.  The only problem is its fuel efficiency.  We bought it with a V6 Magnum, which is a 3.9 litre.  It's only getting about 18 mpg, small town driving.  With that kind of fuel efficiency you might as well buy the Magnum V8.  If its good fuel economy you're looking for, than don't buy a Dodge.<br><br>
