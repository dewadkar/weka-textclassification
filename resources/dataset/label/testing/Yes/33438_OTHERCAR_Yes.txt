            After a lot of research I found that the jetta GLX had everything i was looking for.  It has a 174 HP VR6 engine, 16 inch rims, and leather interrior.  What surprised me was what it had that i wasn't looking for in a sub $30,000 car such as heated seats, rain-sensing wipers, and real wood trim.  
I really like the way this car drives.  Although under extreme cornering it seems to drift a bit because of excessive body roll, however under most normal conditions this car handles great.  With the 5 speed transmission this car is quite quick and always seem s to have more than enough umph to pass.  The interrior of the new Jetta is more fitting of cars twice its price.  It feels highly upscale.  
The Jetta seems to have the image as a &quot;girls&quot; car for some reason.  No doubt that girls love this car when they ride in it.  But I think this is as much a mans car as anything.<br><br>
