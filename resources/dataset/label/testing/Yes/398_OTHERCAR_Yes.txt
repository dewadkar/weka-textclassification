            Although i haven't actually bought a Nissan Xterra yet i do plan on purchasing one once i graduate and get a real job!  I have researched and test driven and been following the new Nissan SUV.  It is a true SUV for the sports fanatic. It has everything you would need in a reasonable price range.  You can get Top rails, waterproof seats, a tow hatch, and it even comes with a first aid kit!  This SUV is easy to drive, it is not too over powering and handles well and looks great.   I would suggest this new SUV to anyone looking to purchase a great car that runs and handles well and looks great.  <br><br>
