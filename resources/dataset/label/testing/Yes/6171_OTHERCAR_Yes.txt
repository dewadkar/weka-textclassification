            I knew when I got pregnant with our second child that the 2 door pickup we had wasn't going to cut it.  I originally considered buying a foreign minivan due to reliability.  Then I was going to get a Dodge minivan due to the price.  We finally settled on this Chevy due to size and price.  We have a 1999 that we got just a few months ago.  Cars are always cheaper at the end of the year &amp; the beginning of the next year for the prior year's model.  
We did comparison shop between all the foreign vans and domestics.  The Venture is the largest of all.  The only drawback is that I understand that the Ford Windstar has two power sliding doors as opposed to our single passenger side door.  Regardless, that power door is extremely useful.  I can't count the number of times that my two year old climbs in and out by himself, leaving me able to tend to my three month old.
Overall, I would buy the van again.
