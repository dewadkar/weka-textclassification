            I bought this car because I was in the market for a second vehicle.  My wife and I thought about buying a used car, but found that used car prices, with the specs we were looking for, were comparable to the price of the Elantra, and a new Elantra has loads of warranties.  The main selling point for us with the Elantra was the warranties that came with the car.  The next point was the price, which was well within our price range.  This car gives a smooth ride.  In the wintertime (which is nearly year-round in the Great Lakes snow-belt region), this car heats quickly.  This car is big enough for most drivers to fit comfortably behind the wheel.  The back bench, while it does have three seatbelts, shouldn't have three people in the back unless they are smaller individuals.<br><br>
