            Although it is nothing more than a glorified Ford F-150, the Ford Expedition is a somewhat unique vehicle.  You can haul stuff - everything from sheets of plywood to bicycles.  You can haul people - up to nine, if a few of them are children.  You can haul a camper - in our case a 26 footer.  Perhaps most importantly, you can haul all of these and more in comfort, what a brute!
We needed a truck that could pull a 5000lb. trailer but yet that could operate the majority of the time as a family vehicle.  We had an extended cab truck but the comfort level for the kids was practically nonexistent.
The Ford Expedition has plenty of room with three rows of seats.  It has plenty of power - able to pull our camper easily with the Triton V8 and the factory Class IV towing package, although due to the short wheelbase there is some amount of sway and jitter from the camper on longer trips.
The cab of the Expedition is extremely comfortable, with plenty of options.  Although the reach for the radio and H/A controls is a little long, being a little taller/bigger person I love the roominess inside the cab.  Also, and this fact is well noted, this vehicle does tend to roll a little in corners, top-heavy.
I have found the Expedition to be reliable and easy to maintain thus far and as far as SUV's are concerned the Expedition is tops in styling.
