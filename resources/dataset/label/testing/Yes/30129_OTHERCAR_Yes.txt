              The Chevy Nova is an incredible car.  I got this car about 4 years ago, and it has been a wonderful friend ever since.  I've traveled in it from Detroit, MI to deep into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (near Wisconsin) and back a number of times, and it has never left me stranded in the middle of nowhere.  I've been harsh on it (forgot to change the oil for about a year), and it has been forgiving.  I only had to get one somewhat major repair done (the car had stopped working after a period of ignored engine trouble), but it didn't cost much more than $80.  It averages about 20 miles per gallon in stop and go city driving, and I've gotten over 30 miles per gallon on long trips.
  This is an incredibly comfortable car to sit in and drive around listening to music.  The driver's seat even offers lumbar support, which my sister thinks is cool.  I don't use the lumbar support, because I think it is less comfortable than the default seat setting.  This is a car to drive when you want to go somewhere, because it will get you there.
  The hatchback version of this car has a great amount of storage space.  I used this car to take all of my stuff up to college with me, and it all fit with room to spare.  I do not own a bike rack, but I can fit two bicycles in the back of the Nova and still have room for other things.
