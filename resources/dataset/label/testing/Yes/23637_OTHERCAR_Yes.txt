            We didn't intend to buy a new car, we just stopped by the dealer to look at an Explorer actually.  We drove the Explorer and it was nice but we wanted to check out all our options. They also had a Jeep Cherokee on the lot and we decided to drive that one too.  It was immediately fun to drive. The model is a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Country.
 The first thing I will tell you is I am not an expert by any means, but even I could tell there was such a difference in the power of the engine in the Jeep, its a straight 6 (automatic) so it has some ummppfff. We have been told with routine maintenance the engine will last a good 200,000 miles, which I hope is true because we just hit 85,000.
The overall options (on this model- &quot;country&quot;)were nice power everything and cruise control.
The passenger area in front is roomy, but the back is better for a child or small adult. As far as comfort goes, it was just as much of a comfortable ride on a trip to Washington from California (14 hours straight) as it is to drive around at home. The cargo area is roomy enough to not have to use the roof rack on a trip. It has performed well in rain, mud and snow without fail, no problems ever with the 4 wheel drive. We have towed trailers with a full ton load of rock and it did well. The gas mileage is &quot;okay&quot;, we average about 350 miles to a full tank, which is 20 gallons (larger in comparison to a blazer or 4-runner which is 14 gallons). We are getting that gas mileage commuting so its a lot of highway driving and some city as well. The only problem we have noticed, which we were told is a characteristic of Jeep's and its been checked twice now is a cluncking in the rear end area (possibly with the suspension unloading), but it doesn't seem to affect anything and 2 Jeep mechanics have told us its fine.  All in all its a great mid size SUV, affordably priced and fun to drive.<br><br>
