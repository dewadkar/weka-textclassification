            I have owned Corvettes since 1966 when I bought a 1963 split window coupe. Until the 1986 model (I did not have a 1985) the Vette was always a good looking 2 seater that was very fast in a straight line but, had poor performance compared to Prosche, E Type Jags, Lotus and others. It also tended to rattle after about 10K miles and was expensive to maintain.

Starting in 1986 the performance characteristics of the vette are better than most street Porsches, Lotus' and Jags and, are close to Ferrari, high end Porsches and the Viper and NSX. However, the Vette costs much less (about 1/2) is almost maintenance free, is much better looking and, costs less to operate. Should you have a problem, you can go to any Chevy dealer, what happens if your Porsche breaks down in Buttcrack Arkansas? Where do you go for service.

Driving a Corvette with the top down on a back country road at about 85mph with your favorite rock tunes blasting out of the teriffic CD player that is standard, is a spiritual event. It is also a sensual experience being wrapped in that leather pilots seat surrounded by speed, power and elegance. It is almost enough to make you give up sex.

If you are looking for a sports car, and you don't want to spend $85K, BUY THIS CAR!!!<br><br>
