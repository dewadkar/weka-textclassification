If you are looking for a second car that is affordable, unique, and fun to drive, I highly recommend the Alfa GTV-6. This 2-door coupe was only made from 1981 to 1987, but they can be found for $2,000 - $7,000 and the experience of driving them is easily worth twice that amount.

The six-cylinder engine offers more power than the four-cylinder engine found in the earlier GTV or Spider models of the Alfa. The car handles really smartly (like most Italian cars tend to do), plus the styling of the 2-door coupe is really a head turner.

Inside the car, most GTV-6's have leather seats and power windows. But overall the interior is spartan, like a true sports car should be. My only complaint is that there are some quirks that come with owning a GTV-6. Especially small engine oil leaks that I had on both car I owned.

Maintenance isn't terribly expensive, but it is time-consuming. If you plan to do it yourself, you should have access to a garage.

To learn more about the GTV-6, read &quot;The Alfa Romeo Owners Bible&quot;. The book gives a short history of Alfa Romeo and details a few of the more popular models like the GTV-6. It is available at almost any library or can be special ordered by most bookstores.
