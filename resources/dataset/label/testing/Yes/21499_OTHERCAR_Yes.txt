            For years (about twenty-four to be precise), the automotive world has recognized the hatchback as the most practical car design.  The 2000 Volkswagen Golf is simply the top of the hatchback food chain.  I've owned a Golf for eight months now, and every day I find a new way to get more out of it.  
    The GLS model (nicely equipped for $16,975, 5-speed) is now the only four-door version (previous models had offered the four-door design in GL trim).  The base GLS includes a broad range of safety features, including front and side airbags, anti-lock brakes, side marker lights, and an innovative seat-belt retractor which activates just prior to airbag deployment to ensure that front seat passengers are in as safe a position as possible.  Also standard on the GLS are such convenience features as power windows, door locks, mirrors, cruise control and keyless entry.  The Golf also has an excellent security system which qualifies for up to a 35% discount on comprehensive insurance.  An eight speaker stereo cassette is standard, with an in-dash cd player and a trunk mounted cd changer available for around $500.  
    On the road, the Golf has a very confident feel.  While the Golf's familiar stiffness has been dampened, it still leans merrily into corners, while providing a highway ride on par with certain upscale teutonic sedans.  My only complaint is the engine's apparent sluggishness below 2000 rpm's.  
    In utility, the Golf is absolutely unparalleled.  It makes an excellent city car because of it's short wheelbase, yet can swallow just about any cargo when the 60/40 folding seatback is used.  
    The Golf is covered by a superior warranty as well.  Few manufacturers below the luxury level offer free maintenance with their vehicles.  The Volkswagen comes with two years of free service.  It is also covered with unprecedented 10 year/100000 mile powertrain warranties and 12 year, unlimited mileage corrosion warranties.
    The only improvement that could really be made to the Golf is in the engine, but I understand Volkswagen already plans to make the car available with its remarkable 150 hp 1.8L Turbo 4, the same engine used in the Passat, the Beetle, the Audi A4, and, tuned differently, in the TT.  As it stands, the Golf is still absolutely the best car for city use.<br><br>
