            So new car time came a-knockin' and I had a few definite ideas in mind when it came to what I wanted to make payments on for the next five years.   :)

First, it had to at least have the IDEA that it was a sports car.  Secondly, it simply HAD to have a manual transmission (see #1).  Last, it shouldn't break the bank.

The short list included a number of cars, and I will tell you why I didn't get them.

-Mustang GT.  Fun-to-drive and still a real looker after all these years, but...  Antiquated design, simply horrible ergonomics, ridiculous insurance, and a new model is coming soon.

-Mini Cooper S.  VERY fun-to-drive and makes me grin every time I see one, but...  WAY too small, not particularly fast in a straight line, and I think slightly more expensive than need be.

-Honda Accord Coupe with V6 & 6spd.  Sure to be reliable, excellent interior, well-engineered, but...  Very simply, I sat in one and my head hit the roofliner.  End of story.  Oh, and I simply couldn't get over the fact that I didn't like the look of the thing.

-Ford Focus SVT.  Zooty-looking, roomy, quick, phenomenal handling, decent power, but...  Just came out of a Focus hatch and wanted a change.  With options it can get pricey, and now that the 2.3L engine is available in the non-SVT, the performance differential is minimal.  

-Subaru WRX.  The one I have been dreaming of for two years...  Very, very fast (worth a test drive if nothing else), AWD, world-class performance for a song, you get to watch them in action on SpeedChannel every week when the WRC is broadcast, but...  Smaller than the Focus, interior materials of questionable quality, dealers around here aren't willing to DEAL, so with a few choice options it is over $25grand no matter what you do.

Acura RSX.  A cute little guy that has some real cojones, is a blast to drive, a very nice interior, and easily within my financial grasp, but...  A little to "cutesy", a little too small, and a little too feminine for my taste.  Also subject to the local dealers' unilateral addition of "extras" that they weren't willing to pull off the sticker.

Other cars on the list, but out of my reach, included the WRX STi, the Mitsubishi Evolution, Acura TSX (manual), and the Acura CL 6spd.  All were slightly too dear for my current financial situation.

So...  I got the 6.  With the 6, of course, if you see a theme in the above "wish list".

Why?

Well I found most of the above qualities in one car and the price was right.  Every time I drive it I shake my head in wonder that I got such a STEAL for a bit over $20grand.

Mine is a 2003 6S 5spd with only two options, the Sport Package and the Bose stereo, which is exactly the way I wanted it.  Okay, I would have liked a sunroof, but from what I was able to determine you can only get a sunroof with the leather package, and I absolutely HATE leather seats.  I hate leather seats more than I love the sunroof, so I dealt with it.  Please, noone say they got a car with cloth interior and a sunroof, it will simply make me cry.

In any case, I found the following things appealing about the car I ended up buying:

-Performance.  In a nutshell, this is my personal "Son of SHO".  I had a '92 Ford Taurus SHO for four years and 100k miles, and I simply loved it...  Except for its' lack of refinement and reliability that was, *ahem*, "uncertain".  I dig the idea of fast 4-doors and the SHO fit the bill, but I did wish that it had gone to finishing school.  The 6S excels in cornering, braking, steering, the whole enchilada.  The 6S with the Sport Package and a manual tranny equals the performance of my departed SHO yet absolutely flattens it in terms of engineering and space utilization.  Throw in a manual transmission, a choice absent in almost all of the competition, and you have a car that truly is an entertaining piece that will have you anxiously awaiting your next opportunity to find some twisties.

-Interior.  I like the look of the interior and think that the size, just like Goldilocks' third bowl of porridge, is "just right".  The red lighting that comes with the Sport Package rates highly in the "cool factor", there are plenty of cubbyholes and places to put "stuff", the trunk is a good size with a flat floor, and the Bose stereo is a very nice piece of equipment for OEM.

-Exterior.  I don't like the look of it, I LOVE the look of it.  It doesn't look awkward from any angle, it is properly agressive as befits a performance-oriented car, and I sometimes like to just stand there and LOOK at it.  I could possibly do without the "wing" spoiler on the trunk, wishing it had a "lip" spoiler instead, but I will deal with it.  The front end of the car is its' best angle, with a feral squint that makes me smirk with delight.  The styling of the 17" wheels is one of the most attractive I have seen from a mainstream manufacturer.

Inevitably, there are downsides.  Nothing is perfect.

-Size.  There are those that will call this car "small" when compared to others in the class, and that I can't debate.  It IS smaller by thin margins, but I can't and won't complain.  I am not hauling around a family so a huge interior isn't high on my list of priorities.  Let's just say it's more SNUG than the others and you can decide for yourself if it makes the grade.

-Interior.  The quality of the materials and the fit & finish doesn't quite match the CamCord.  This doesn't mean it is "cheap" by any means, just not at the very top.  Ergonomically, one can find issue with the wisdom of placing the HVAC and audio controls six or more inches below the small display that is dedicated to both at the top of the center console, but in the end it's not hard to figure out and after a few days it will be as natural as breathing.

-Performance.  People who delight in car-bashing will claim the 6's V6 is "gutless", but in truth it loses only 20hp and 20lb-ft of torque to the Honda V6 and marginally more to the top-line Camry V6.  It makes up for this deficit by being a slightly smaller and lighter car, and the straight-line performance is mostly a wash as a result.  Note that the Camry in this guise needs premium fuel, though I don't recall if the Accord does...  I do know the 6 does NOT require it.  It is not a lie to suggest that the Mazda could use a little more low-end "oomph", but with a manual at least, you won't often find yourself wishing that it had much more power.  I think a test drive will show that the 6 has a rougher ride than either of the above, but a driver would have to be dead from the neck up to disagree with the statement that "The Mazda 6 is more fun to drive than either the Camry or the Accord".  The 6 is tuned more or less identically to the cars that are sold across the pond, and to the minority that appreciate such suspension tuning, this is a GOOD thing, not a deficit.

Overall, I can find little to fault in the Mazda 6.  A certain contingent of sedan owners seems to be happily awaiting the 6 to be a failure, but if my experience with MY 6 so far is to be taken as an example, there isn't much to worry about.

If you want a bigger interior, if you don't care about the (admittedly subjective) looks of your car, if you don't want a truly stirring driving experience, by all means, get one of the established market leaders.

If you want to step out of the mold a bit and keep a perma-grin on your face, get the 6.

In either case, I hope to be enjoying my 6 for a good, long time.
