            The Sony 83 model digital camera is great.  The pictures are good whether taken inside or outside.  The camera is easy to use, less expensive because it uses floppies as opposed to memory cards, and takes real good pictures.  This is really a great camera!

For a fairly inexpensive camera (I paid $700), the pictures turn out real good.  I first tried the Sony 73, but the indoor pictures were not satisfactory - so I moved up a model ($200 additional).  The Sony 73 works great if your pictures or taken outdoors, but leave a lot to be desired during indoor shots.

I am very pleased with this camera.  I purchased this camera for my college daughter so we could send pictures back and forth using email, and for projects in her classes.  She is a fashion merchandising student and will be taking mostly indoor pictures, so quality of indoor shots was important.

The camera is so easy to use - even my husband could do it! This is a great camera - BUY IT!<br><br>
