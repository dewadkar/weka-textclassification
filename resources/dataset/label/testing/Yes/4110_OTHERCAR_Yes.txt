            The Intrigue by Oldsmobile is by far the best new vehicle that I have ever owned.  This is my third Oldsmobile.  I have progressed from a Cutlass Ciera Wagon, to a Cutlass Supreme sedan and now the Intrigue.

I find the styling exceptional.   The slightly flared fenders over the wheels give a vision of power and are very sleek looking.  

The ride is very smooth, even on long trips.  We have driven on trips of over 600 miles on several occasions and find the ride very comfortable.

Seat adjustments and seat height are always a concern to us when purchasing a car.  My wife is short at 5' and I am 6', so the range of adjustment must accommodate both of us and the view over the hood must be such that my wife has a good view of the road.  We have had no problems with either.  The power seats provide more than adequate adjustment and provide vertical adjustments to allow both of us good vision.

I am very pleased with the instrument placement, but find the heating controls a little confusing to use.  They can be set to AUTO and by setting the temperature where you want it, the system will maintain a constant level.

There are pockets on the doors for storage, 4 cup holders, glove compartment and small storage compartment (for change, sunglasses, etc) on the drivers side.

Mileage averages around 27 on a trip and around 23 city.

We have had no maintenance issues.  We get normal service every 3000 or so miles.  We have approximately 40,000 miles on the car in the 2+ years that we have had it.

All in all we are very pleased with our 1998 Intrigue and will be looking for a new one in 2000-2001.  We would strongly recommend the Olds Intrigue to anyone looking for a mid-size vehicle.<br><br>
