            We have three children, all boys, and discovered that we needed to take two cars every time we took a trip.  We researched SUVs and minivans, and found the Town and Country to meet our needs hands down.  The rear seats may be configured for any combination of cargo or passenger needs.  This makes camping, or grocery store trips, a breeze.  Two rear doors makes loading and unloading the kids a breeze.  The T&C has comes equipped standard with many items that are options on the competition.  We feel like we are driving a luxury sedan instead of a minivan.  With the optional towing package, the T & C handles medium trailers and loads well.  

The cons we noted on our vehicle were some loose exterior trim which was covered under warranty and have since not been an issue.  Also, we would have liked to add the entertainment package and the automatic rear cargo door this would have increased the price by several thousand dollars and put the vehicle outside of our price range.
