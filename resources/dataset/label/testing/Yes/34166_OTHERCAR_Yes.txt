            I traded in a 3 year old Cadillac on this top of the line Camry back in '94.  In my 37 years of driving, I have NEVER owned a car six years.  This Camry now has only 57,000 miles but get this...The only problem I have had with this car is the power radio antenna has failed twice.  Both times due to a plastic gear mechanism.  

One set of tires, three batteries, and gas/oil and the thing rides and drives like new still.  It is doubtless the most reliable, trouble free car I've owned.  

If I had to criticize it I guess I would say it is too quiet.  A couple of times I have tried to start the engine when it was already running. (Doh!)Oh, and there isn't quite enough headroom in front with the moon roof... Other than that, I just don't know how to describe total satisfaction with a car any better.<br><br>
