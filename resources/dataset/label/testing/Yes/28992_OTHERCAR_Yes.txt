            We got this car as we required a vehicle that was easy to get in and out off due to my wife having bad knees.Also we did not want a large vehicle.We have had a Mazda 626 for 14 years and we did look at the Tribute.We still have the 626 and get around about 37 mpg city and highway driving so we wanted something that still gave us good mileage and comfort.
We live in Alberta Canada so our winters get down to -40c at times.The last winter was the first time we had this car as we got it in June 2002.It has proved great for us and the service we got from Honda has been excellent.
Last Sept we drove it to Northern California to a family wedding a round trip off approx 5500 kms.Our gas consumption worked out to 33 mpg imperial for the round trip which I thought was not to bad.
We got the 5 speed as we are used to driving with a standard so this did not bother us and also for driving in the snow conditions.Our winters here last from about November to April.This car has an excellent heater and it warms up real fast and gives out lots of heat when the outside temperature  was -32c.There were no problems at all in the cold weather with this car and we did not get stuck once and we went through some deep snow.Once the car is warmed up you can drive in shirt sleeves and also it has a good defroster.
Another reason we got this car that it comes with all the standard things like ABS, air conditioning, cruise control and in this part of the country a block heater.
It is very comfortable to drive and not a lot of excessive road noise.
The controls are well placed and easy to operate.
Lots of room in the front and the back.
I wish Honda would make this a hatch back so you could carry some 8 ft studs if need be.
We have 30000 kms on this car and so far no problems other than the regular oil and filter changes.
Just after we got this car we did notice that there we corrosion spots showing up on the wheels (steel rims).We contacted the dealer here in Edmonton and also Honda.They said the rims were not covered on the warranty but they fixed it for me.The dealer had the car for 3 days and they removed the wheels and had them stripped and repainted at no cost to me.So far no more rust is showing up.I believe this was rust coming from the rims not paint chipping.
All in all a real good car for what we require.
Hope this report is helpful to any one looking at purchasing a CRV.
There is one other complaint we had it is that the standard does not come with arm rests.The automatics do.I did get the dealer to fit armrests but it took a of talking.It does not interfere in any way with the stick shift.
