                   Originally, the van was bought because my family went on frequent road trips for soccer games.  A regular car was just too cramped for 4 people to sit together in.  So we went car shopping... We didn't really have any specific car model in mind.. but one thing we wanted was a dual control of the radio. You know how it is, the kids and parents are always fighting about the station and telling the driver to change the station.  So when we saw that the Villager had this option, we bought the van.

       Interior wise, it is pretty spacious.  Instead of getting the bench row, we got captains seats, separated seats in the first row of the back.  This was good because it separated the fighting siblings and they could easily fold to become handy foot rests/cup holders when sitting in the back row.  If large objects like sofas need to be transported, the two seats can easily be removed and the last row can slide to the front.  There are many cup holders all around the car.. which is great...in my opinion.  

       Now, other features of the van are overall pretty good.  It handles the road very well with its engine.  Traveling to Big Bear, the handled the curves relatively well... the driver's technique must be taken into consideration as well.  However, I do remember one time where the mechanical features of the car failed.  Once, the gear shifter got stuck and wouldn't shift to park..... yes it was a hassle.. the car had to be towed and taken to the shop... other than that.. the van is a good sturdy car.  However, this van only has only sliding door.. not two like the more recent cars if you like that sort of option.

      Driving this van is a cinch...it may be a little awkward driving in the van for the first time.  But in time, after driving the van, a car will seem like a tiny toy.  The best thing about the van is the view of other cars which the height provides.

Any family should buy this van.  It hold up to 7 passengers, including the driver.  Kids can sit in the back, in different rows if necessary, and remain separated to prevent fighting on those long long road trips.  Anyone who who lugs around a lot of things should also buy this van... it is a great van!!
