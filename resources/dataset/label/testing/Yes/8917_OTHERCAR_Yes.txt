               Please do not get me wrong we love our 1998 Dodge Caravan,it has all the room any mother of twins could ask for. the slide doors are really great and the proference has been pretty decent. 

  But at 16,000 miles we took it to a Dodge Dealership because it was not shift into gear properly, the rpms would rev way to high before it went into the next gear. Well the techenchian said that there was nothing wrong with it.That they could not verify the problem and there is nothing thet could do. Well we said ok and countiuned to drive it we went to Florida and to Pennsyvlina and we drote it to work daily with was about 60 mile round trip. The Transmission kepted doing the same thing, we took it back in and they said they same thing that they could not verify the complaint. By this time I know these people thought I was imaging this.So my husband said ok they say that there is nothing wrong with it and we just conutined to drive it and the RPM kept on reving up. But we had been told that there was nothing wrong with it and to keeping driving it .So we did . 
   
  In March 2000 we went to get in our van and we strapped the girls in to their carseats and locked the doors and we got in and we started it up to go to the grocery store. Well we took off the Emergency Brake and put the Van in Reverse but the car would not move. We tried to put it in Drive it would not move and the same with 1 and 2 gears. The Van had 38,000 miles plus on it and we had no idea what was wrong with it. So on the next morning which was Monday ,I called the Dealership were we bought the van and I spoke to the service department adn they said to have it towed in and that they would tell me what was wrong the next day. 
  
   I called our Dodge roadside asstisitance and set it up to have our van towed to the dealship. So the tow truck driver came and tried to put chains on it and put it up on this flatbed truck he was driving. That was a sight to see. The tow truck driver had to literally let the flatbed down on the ground and back the truck up to get it on the truck to tow it to the dealship.The tow truck driver basically said that the tranmission was shot. 

  The Dodge Dealership called me that afternoon and said that my transmission was gone and I needed a new Transmission and it had to be replaced . You could imagie the shock that I was in , here was a 1998 Dodge Caravan with 38,000 miles on it and the Transmission went out. I was very Livid adn I asked the poor guy that called me how in the would do the transmission  go out on a van that is bearly 2 years old and has 38,000 miles on it. The guy had not answer to my question. So please if you are having this short of trouble please ,please insist to the dealership that they need to check the transmission out , The clutch thing inside the transmission had went out and some other part had came lose and that is what was wrong with our transmission, I would say the Van is nice and i Love my van,but the service that i revieved was really lousey. <br><br>
