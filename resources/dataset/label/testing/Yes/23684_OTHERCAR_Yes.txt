            I have had my 2002 PT Cruiser for a year now and still love it as much as the day I bought it.  I purchased the Limited Edition Model in Steel Blue.  For the extra money the Limited Edition is well worth it. 

The limited edition cruiser comes with a front seat adjustment that allows you to raise up & down and move the seat closer or further from the steering wheel.  Being 5'4" this was a plus for me.  I need to be able to see over the hood to feel comfortable driving.  It gives me a better perception of what is around me.  The driving view is like one you would see in a small SUV (i.e. Jeep Cherokee).  You are able to see further down the road as to what is going on with the traffic.  This model also has heated front seats with a hi and low adjustment.  They are great when it is cool just press that low switch and they heat up quickly.  But, beware, press the hi switch and you will get a hot seat pretty quickly.  The car also came with traction control.  We don't get alot of snow in Central North Carolina but with the little bit we had the car handled great.  It handles great on the wet pavement too.

The inside of the car can carry alot of items also.  You just have to know how to adjust the seats and place the items.  I have brought home small trees up to 8' in the back of the car with the hatch closed.  I also have a labrador retriever and I had concerns that he would be able to ride comfortably.  I just fold down the rear seats, put down a quilt and he jumps right in and enjoys the ride.

The only draw back to the car is the front spoiler.  There is a black plastic protector under the front bumper.  You have to watch where you drive; if the road has a decent dip the car will ground out.  Also, be careful when pulling into a parking spot with those concrete markers.  Go too close and you will go over one and catch the spoiler on it.

Aside from the above I love the car,  I have an automatic and it is getting 22-24 mpg.  If I run the air it gets 19-21 mpg.  It handles great and most of all its fun to look at.
