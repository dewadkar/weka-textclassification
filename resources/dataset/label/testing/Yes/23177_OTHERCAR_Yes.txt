            I purchased my Honda Accord in 1996, and it has been one of the best purchase decisions I have made.  

In 1996, I was a recently employed, newly married college graduate, and was looking to purchase my first new vehicle.  I spent my high school and college years driving a Toyota Corolla, which was a wonderful and reliable vehicle.  I decided to base my new purchase on my Corolla, and looked only for highly reliable vehicles.  My choice came down to the Toyota Camry and the Accord.  At the time, the Accord was more affordable to me, so I purchased the 1996 Accord 4 door with a 4 cylinder engine.

My Accord has been nothing but reliable and comfortable.  To date, some 65,000 miles later, my car has needed nothing but fuel and oil changes.  It has handled wonderfully throughout.  The 4 cylinder power has been more than enough for my needs, whether in the city or on long family trips.  The interior has been very comfortable, and has provided sufficient room for my family.  Friends often comment on the ample rear seating space.

I recommend this vehicle without hesitation to anyone looking for a reliable vehicle.  The Accord is appropriate for almost anyone, young or old, large family or small, for business trips or just to run the kids to a friends.  My next car purchase will undoubtedly be a Honda.<br><br>
