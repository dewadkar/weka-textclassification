            Toyota Sienna 2000: Last updated 04-24-01

  I have owned a Toyota Sienna 2000 XLE, color denim blue, for about 3 months now and I am completely satisfied with the purchase of my minivan.  It has a very professional style and has the perfect size.

Competition:
  If you are shopping for a minivan, you probably might know that the 2 top minivans currently on the market is either the Toyota Sienna or the Honda Odyssey.  All the other minivans don't seem to live up to the standard that Honda and Toyota have created.   The main question most have is whether to get  Honda Odyssey or a Toyota Van.  Before I got the minivan, I owned 2 Honda Accords in the past.    

Research:
  The most important thing before buying a car involves research and checking out all the prices.  I have checked every web site and dealers trying to find the prices of the vans including options and all that other stuff.  I was able to find out how much my van was really worth.  The XLE for the Toyota Sienna really has a price for about $25,000.  From there, I was able to figure out how much the dealers were making from the sale of the van by looking at the markup prices at dealerships.
  I know a lot of people who bought a Honda Odyssey just because they liked the "magic" 3rd row seating that folded down to provide more trunk space.  Many people may think this is the best feature, but there are people who fail to see the negative side to it.  The Sienna's 3rd row consists of two chairs put together instead of one whole bench.  Whenever I occassionaly run out of trunk space, I just fold and lift the chair to stand vertically so it not only provides more room for the trunk, but i can also have my child sit in the other seat in the 3rd row.  If you wanted more space for the Honda, you would have to sacrifice 2 seats to get more trunk space instead of just 1 for the Toyota Sienna.

Test-drive:
  I have personally tested both the 2000 Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna.  The results?...Since the Honda Odyssey was high and demand and was difficult to find one available to testdrive, i only had the chance to test drive it 2 times.  On the first time, I was very disappointed.  The Honda Odyssey drove..well, like a Honda..it wasn't smooth at all and drove like a Dodge Caravan or Voyager.  The seats were uncomfortable and I just couldn't bear it.  After the test-drive, I just thought that something was wrong with the van.  I decided to go to another dealer and test-drive it again..the same results.  Since I was unsatisfied with the ride and I owned 2 Honda Accords already, I might as well try something new.  I decided to go for the Toyota Sienna because it was as good as the Odyssey.  By the way, most of the Honda dealers I went to had bad service because they knew they had a hot-selling van and they wanted customers to come to them instead of them going to me. Why should I spend my hard earned money when in the long run, i'm getting bad service and something that doesn't make me satisfied?
  The first time I went to drive a 2000 Toyota Sienna, I was very impressed.  The seats were very comfortable...more comfortable than any other ordinary seat.  Wow, i was very impressed with the ride.  It was very smooth and peacful.  

Buying:
  When I went to buy my car, I went along the freeway and stopped by Toyota 101.  That is where I bought my car.  The first thing I noticed about their vans was that there was no dealer markup at all..just the retail price.  I was wrong when I thought I wouldn't be able to bargain the dealer to lower the price.  The salesman was very helpful and very supportive in my van-buying process.  He showed everything about the van inside out.  I was amazed.  I was able to take home the van the very same day.  He told me he was going to give me a call after a couple weeks to check up on me.   I negotiated and bought the van for about $26,000 before tax.  It was under $30,000 after tax. 

Main Features:
The van included:
6 speaker stero
tape/cd
power door
running boards
allow wheels
Towing package
Power driver seat

After Buying:
    A few weeks later, I received a phone call from him and I told him I was very satisfied with the van. 

Summary:
  As you know, I am still very happy about the van.  After I had bought the Sienna, I wondered what it would be like if I had gotten the Odyssey instead.  I knew I would regret getting a Sienna if I had gotten an Odyssey instead.  Although the Odyssey has two powerdoors and that folding magic chair that folds into the trunk, The sienna has 1 powerdoor and all the seats can be folded down .  Just to let you know, I had bought a piece of furniture at a store and it was contained in a box about 8 ft long and 3 ft high.  I was successfully able to put in in the Sienna by folding down 1 front and back seats.  I was able to go home with my family with 2 seats in the back remaining.  If I had put it in the Odyssey, I would have had to put down more seats.
  I completely recommend that you get a Toyota Sienna, you will not regret it. I have read many reviews that say that the speaker system is horrible.  It is if you have 4 speakers.  If you have 6 speakers ( the one I have), there is a big difference and it sounds really good.

Please rate my opinion so I will know whether I need to update it.

   Someone had sent me an email to me that they were considering either a Toyota Sienna 2000 or a Nissan Quest.  Just to let you know, I know a friend who owns a Nissan Quest and they bought their van for a little over $22,000.  Since he noticed that my van was very similar in features such as driver power seats, alloy wheels, etc...except for the running boards at the bottom, he asked me how is the Sienna around $30,000 and has almost the same features whereas the Quest is only about $22,000.  The answer to that is the quality of parts and features.  I know that the parts of Toyota are the best quality.  To tell you the truth, Toyota has many hidden safety features that Quest does not have.  For example, (please forgive me if I have mentioned this before) if you get on a head on collision, the engine immediately drops to the ground in order to prevent the engine crashing into the driver.  Some other small features include a highly-resitant dashboard which is protected against high heat.  Just to let you know, the Quest minivan will no longer be in production due to the lack of sales.  One more comment that has been introduced was the seating room.  Even though the back seats do not move back and forward, there is still plenty of room because the front seats move very far and back.  In order to make room for the trunk, one or two seats can be folded and lifted partially to make a little more room for the trunk.
