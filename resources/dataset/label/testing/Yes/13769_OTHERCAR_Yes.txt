            I bought my Dodge 1500 Quad cab about 4 months ago.  So far with 36,000 miles on it, (that's right, no typo) I have no major complaints.  
The vehicle runs great, has power to spare and is much more comfortable than my old Mazda/Ford Ranger.

Quality:  The Dodge group has really improved over the past few years.  Fit and finish is first class.  The only issue I have is a light wind whistle at highway speeds.  Nothing major, but it can get downright annoying on long trips.
Economy:  Averageing about 15.4 mpg hwy.  City can be all over the place depending on how you drive.  I've done as well as 14 and as poor as 12.  If you have a lead foot and squeal it off the line, you will be visiting the pump often.
Style:  LOVE IT&gt;  I can't stand the new fords and GM/Chevy's they are so generic.  The Dodge looks like a baby Kenworth.
Comfort:  Better than trucks used to be, but even with the comfy seats, the Dodge rides like a truck.  Over rough roads you are going to get bounced.
Only issue with the vehicle is the soft feeling brakes.  Even after new brakes are installed, the system feels somewhat vague like it's not sure it really wants to stop when you do...<br><br>
