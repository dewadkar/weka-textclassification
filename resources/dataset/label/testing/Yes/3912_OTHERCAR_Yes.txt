            We bought a 2001 Silhouette in September, and after 2 months, I am still very happy with our selection.

I was looking for the following features in a minivan:  rear captain�s chairs, rear A/C, keyless remote, and priced under $25000.  After looking at a few vans, we also decided that we preferred the flexibility of the removable rear seats, and the back seat as a split bench rather than one piece.  I am able to remove and replace the seats by myself.

There are 2 sizes of minivans.  The �regular� size is about 185-187 inches long, and the �extended/Grand� vans which are about 10 inches longer.  We decided to buy a van that was longer to have more rear passenger leg room, and more cargo space.  One warning about the longer van:  We knew the van would fit in the garage, and it does.  However, we soon found out that when you open the rear hatch, it will hit the bottom edge of the garage door.  Our neighbors who drive a Grand Caravan do not have this problem.  We were able to solve the problem by attaching a piece of rubber tubing to the garage door.

There is a lot of cargo space in the Silhouette.  We removed one of the rear seats to bring home an 8 foot ladder.  It is much easier to take the wagon and bicycles to the park now too.  A small bike with training wheels and a Big Wheel tricycle had to be put in the car just the right way to fit.  Next time we get a TV or a small piece of furniture, we won�t need to pay for delivery.  I also like knowing that we have plenty of room for luggage and golf clubs when the grandparents visit.

One reason we went with Oldsmobile is that we have been driving a Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme for several years.  The dealer closest to our house has always provided us with excellent service.  Every car needs maintenance and repairs, so it is nice to know that we have a good place to take the minivan for service.

We decided not to get the power sliding door.  It seemed kind of expensive and likely to break.  I may sometimes like to have the power sliding door, but I�m glad we didn�t get it.  I always load the kids from the driver side so that I can buckle my son in his car seat.  We also felt that a child who is too small to open the sliding door has to be walked to wherever we are going anyway.

The gas mileage is similar to other vans, even better than some smaller vans.  We have been getting about 18 mpg running around town.  I hate pumping gas, so the 25 gallon tank is a plus.

I like the captain�s chairs in the center for the kids.  It does make it a little more difficult to get to the back seats, but when the grandparents visit, we can put the kids in the back.  It is easy to use our child seats in the van.  We have a booster seat for our 5 year old, and a car seat for our 2 year old.

It is maneuverable in the parking lot, and I can make U-turns without difficulty.  I like the automatic headlights and the daytime running lights.  The front seats also have side impact air bags.  The van also comes with On-Star and 1 year of service.  It is a nice feature, but not something I intend to pay for after the year is up.  A CD player is standard, and I have liked having it more than I realized.  The accessories remain powered after you turn off the key for 10 minutes or until you open a door.  That is a nice feature when you want to close the power windows.  There are plenty of cup holders, but it doesn�t really have a good place for loose change.  The cargo net in the rear is convenient for groceries, and I like the net between the front seats for my diaper bag.  It has 2 trip odometers, so when we took the van on a trip, we could easily switch between miles per tank of gas and the total trip miles.  The van also has a built in air pump.  I have not used it yet, but it seems pretty handy for camping equipment and inflating toys and air mattresses at home.  The Silhouette also has an oil indicator which tells you when it is time to change the oil.

One thing I don�t like about the van is that with the Captain�s chairs, the passenger side blind spot requires the use of mirrors.  I�m used to looking over my right shoulder, and it is a difficult habit to break.  This is an issue when changing lanes or in parking lots.  I have attached a small mirror to my rear-view mirror for watching the kids, but I find that if I angle the mirror properly, it gives me really good visibility for that blind spot.

When we started looking for vans, the 2000 rebates had been available for quite some time.  The vans were really picked over, and most of the remaining ones tended to be loaded with a lot of features that we didn�t want to pay for.  So we ended up getting a van when they started rebates on the 2001 models.  Silhouette is a great van, but it is not one of the more popular vans, so we didn�t have to wait long for a good deal on the new model year.<br><br>
