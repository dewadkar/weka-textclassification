            I will not mince words here.  I love my TT(225 coupe), and I shudder to think just how close I came to buying another sports car.  The story begins at my local Honda dealer when the first pictures of the s2000 hit the magazines.  I wanted this car something fierce.  I was even willing to put down a deposit and pay over sticker for the car. When my car came in, and I was finally able to take an extended test drive, I was thrilled to drive a street legal race car.  It was an awesome driving experience in every way but one.  The engine was loud(98db at full throttle)to the point of distraction.  The buzzing in my ears told me that I couldn't possibly buy the Honda.  I left the same day with my deposit in hand in search of another car.

What does this have to do with the TT?  Simply this:  The Audi may not be the fastest car out there.  The Audi may not have a direct linkage gear box. The audi may not have razor sharp handling. The audi may be built on a volkswagen frame.  But who cares?  For my money the Audi is the best real world sports car out there.  Fun to drive.  Fast( well fast enough). Comfortable on the highway.  etc. etc. etc.  

Do yourself a favor.  Buy this car.<br><br>
