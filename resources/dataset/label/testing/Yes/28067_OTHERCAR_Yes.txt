            Well, that's what I call my car.  I am fortunate enough to drive a 2001 Impala 100% for free as a company car.  And yes, it's easy to look upon a FREE car with rose-colored glasses.  But of all the company cars I've ever driven(there have been 4:  one Taurus, one Lumina, one Malibu, and this Impala), I would have to say that the Impala is one that I would actually buy for my family.  

The first impression you get from the inside of the car is that of space.  Bordering on cavernous, this car beats any other full-size car I've driven in recent memory.  I travel a lot and rent a lot of cars, so I get exposed to many different models.  

Speaking of cavernous, the trunk on the Impala could be used for grizzly hibernation experimentation.  I don't think I could ever come close to filling it.

I was also impressed by the standard features of the Impala.  Though I have never had the need to use the ON-STAR feature, I am glad that it's there.  I also like the sound system.  My company sprung for the model with a CD player, which is a first for me in company cars.  The air conditioner blows in Arctic Air, which is also an improvement from past Chevys that I've driven.

I've driven the car for 2 months now, and so far, NO rattles, buzzes, hums, clicks, or annoying, unexplained noises.  Again, a first for a company car for me.  In fact, the car is surprisingly quiet even at freeway speeds.  

Now for the downside:

The driver's seat is fairly comfy, but I've had more than one complaint about the front passenger seat.  It's like a buckboard, or so I've heard.  Maybe "school bus seat" is more accurate.  

The instrument package leaves a lot to be desired on the model I am driving.  No tach, oil pressure, or electrical gauge, but there is a temperature gauge.  It does have a small dot-matrix warning/status indicator for the common warnings (low fuel, door open, etc.).  I guess I just like to have the instruments as a back-up.
