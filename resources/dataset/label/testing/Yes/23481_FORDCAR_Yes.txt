            Don't get me wrong, I love Fords (especially the '67 mustangs).  But for some reason the transmisions, in these wagons, seem to be the first thing to go.  My mom had an '87 taurus wagon LX, and the transmission, went out, cost an arm and a leg to repair.  Now I've got a '91 wagon, just spent $2,000 on a new transmission, it started blowing steam through the vents,and then a few days later it started overheating, and walla, messed up head gaskets, water pump and yes the transmission, what a bummer.  There are some good points to these cars though, nice gas millage, all those cool little electronic things, nice interior, roomy, and great take off, these things, get going SUPER fast!  Great if you've got kids!  Before I forget, one more bad point, the paint seems to start wearing off in a few years, it looks real ugly, starts at the top and works it's way down.<br><br>
