            I just purchased a 2000 model Intrigue and needless to say,  I love it!! I looked at several imports, Honda, Nissan and Toyota and when I drove the intrigue, there was just no comparison. I like a car that when asked to kick it in gear, it does.  And boy, does this one.  I was impressed with the engine and the comfort of the seats.  I have gotten tired of the imports seats that have a short bottom section and no real support for the lower thighs.  The Intrigue could use a little lesson in cabin decorations from the imports.  It is a little bland but the HUGE trunk and its good road manners make up for the lack of gadgets inside.  My only complaint about the car is that the dash is shallow when it comes to after market stereo equipment.  If you buy one,  go ahead and opt for the CD changer and upgraded sound system.  I didn't and now am having a hard time finding a unit that is pleasing to the eye that will fit in the shallow opening.  If you really like to drive (I do, I am a cop) this car should be on your &quot;gotta see&quot; list!  Like the commercial said sometime back, this isn't your fathers' Oldsmobile!!<br><br>
