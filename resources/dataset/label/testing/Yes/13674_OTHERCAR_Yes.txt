            Okay, I know I just wrote about my 1988 Trooper, but I've leased a new 1999 Trooper and must sing it's praises!  It is everything my old Trooper wasn't.  It has tons of power and all kinds of automation.  Power door locks, power windows, security system and more.  

The only minor gripe is the lack of armrests between the driver and passenger.  My sister actually fell over into me because she was used to the old armrests.

That said, the new Trooper is a beaut!  The solid car cover is very distinctive, and I've gotten tons of complements on the car.  4WD on the fly is another sweet feature, and the Torque-On-Demand system seems pretty neat (though we haven't had enough snow to really test it yet).  

If you want to be different (next time you're on the road count the number of Cherokees) go for the Trooper.  It's very distinctive and very eyecatching.  <br><br>
