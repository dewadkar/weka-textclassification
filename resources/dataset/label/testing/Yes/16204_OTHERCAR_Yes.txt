            * Included in the box is the Minolta DiMAGE X20 camera, 8MB memory card, 2 AA batteries, a wrist and neck strap, cables for televisions and computers, two discs and instructions. Although this will depend on the place of purchase and deals.
* The Minolta DiMAGE X20 is very stylish, with its ultra slim body and fashionable look which will suit anyone's age; from the cool teenager to the trendy grandparents. The front looks very nice and the back contains the LCD screen and easy control buttons. The body is very sleek but not too small.
* When switched on, the Minolta DiMAGE X20 lights up in various places and produces a sound which is very cool. The LCD screen immediately goes into picture mode and you are ready to go!
* There are two main settings: picture and movie, easily changed by a switch on th top. Both are easy to use and the amount used or stored does depend on the size of memory card.
* The first thing to do is read the manual quickly to learn the basics then set up the menu, such as date and time, etc.
* There is a playback button which allows you to view all your pictures and movies.

*One of my favourite features is the voice memo which allows you to record a voice message with each picture, which is a brilliant feature.
* Another is the movie mode which most cameras will have nowadays but it is good to use from time to time as I have found it quite useful. All movies can be viewed on the LCD screen or when connected to the TV.

The good points are its overall shape and ease of use. Its very glam and has many features. The camera uses AA batteries which is useful as rechargeable ones can be bought or they can be taken out the nearest control without missing the picture opportunity. The zoom is very good and has a bright flash. The quality and size of pictures can be adjusted to your preference and unwanted pictures or movies can be deleted easily. When connected to the computer, the memory card can be loaded onto the computer so there is  more storage. The picture quality is good for the user but a professional would probably buy a more expernisive one. The price is not too bad either and deals are often around so I would suggest searching!

The bad points are that some things are not mentioned in the instruction book such as how to remove the voice memo from a picture, although this can be found online. Also a case is not included.

I would recommend buying a battery charger and spare sets of batteries incase the other ones run out. This will save money in the long term and are not expensive to buy. Buying a case will protect the camera and these can be bought anywhere!

This is a fantastic little camera and would recommend to anyone who is considering it!!
