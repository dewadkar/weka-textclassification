            My Accord EX-V6 is the best Honda I've had yet!  I've owned Honda automobiles since 1982 and this one is my favorite.  I've never had a car with anything but a 4-cylinder engine; but when I test drove the V-6, I knew what I was going to buy!

Recently I did a lot of traveling back and forth to and around the Chicago area and was I happy I had spent the extra money for the V-6.  When I needed the extra power in some hectic rush hour traffic situations, I stepped on the gas and we took off without hesitation!  With all of the driving that I did, the car proved to be extremely comfortable and a joy to drive.  I was concerned about gas mileage, but I believe that I get about the same gas mileage that I did with my 1993 4-cylinder Accord.  The programmable garage door opener is also handy, not only for my garage door but for the family members whose garage doors I can open with MY car!

I initially had some trouble with the electric locks and security alarm, but this was found to be due to a defective remote.  It was replaced by my dealer and has caused no further problems.

I also recommend Honda vehicles to my friends because of the high resale and trade-in values I have ALWAYS gotten on my old Hondas.  Honda isn't the cheapest car out there; but if quality and value are important to you, it is the best buy in town! <br><br>
