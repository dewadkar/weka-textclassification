                 I have owned my 1991 Eagle Talon TSi for about two and a half years now. Previously I drove a Plymouth Laser, the same basic vehicle marketed under a different name. Having already had that car for almost two years, I was well aquatinted with the handling personality and good looks of the car. What I was missing was the power. All that was solved with the Talon. Along with the increase in horsepower comes an automatic upgrade in interior refinements as well. The whole package is very well thought out and executed.
     When looking for one of these machines, there are a few things to watch for. One, does it have all the options your looking for. Granted there are few on the TSi, but they are there none the less. The two biggest are leather seating surfaces, (I wouldn't recommend this if you planning on driving quickly. Ones rear tends to wander in fast cornering) and All-Wheel-Drive. You can easily tell if the car has been equipped with the AWD by the markings behind the door openings. The second thing to look for is mileage. If the car has over 100,000 miles you should look initially for things like oil seeping out around the head gasket and turbo housing. It would probably also be a good idea to have a mechanic look it over.
     Driving this car is what driving is all about. It displays precise handling in the corners and blistering speed. With proper launching technique, the car can post 0-60 times in the mid five second range over and over. The seats do a great job of holding you in place and are comfortable all day long. The interior is quiet and buttoned down, only over the harshest of back roads does it emit any kind of rattle.
     In the end, for the money you get a car with great looks, loads of power and the ability to grab peoples attention. (Especially if yours is painted Rally Red like mine!) The only downfall to this car is the relatively high price of parts and labor, and if you blow that turbo....uh oh. But so far I haven't had any real trouble with the car aside from the clutch ($600 total). Its a great car at a great price.<br><br>
