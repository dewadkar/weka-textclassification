            I have a feeling everyone will have a story about their Kia Sedona at some point or another. I read all of the reviews before buying our's in August of 2002, even the scary ones. You have to understand that most of the private reviews posted are going to be bad on an average sometimes. Not many happy people want to vent. Angry people do. I have noticed that there are not as many horror stories as there were last year. Blah, Blah, Blah,... ok I'll get on with it now.

So far our Kia has 15,000 miles approx. We drove it from California to Virginia where we just moved. Handled and drove great. There is only one dealer close to us in Charlottesville that is also an Audi dealer. Audi is on their backs about selling KIAs next to their line.

Rear electric pop out windows came apart, cotter pins fell right off. Both of them did this within a week of each other. They were flapping around in the wind! My 3 year old thought it was cool though. This will happen to all 2002 Sedonas from what I have heard. 

Rear Hatch Release handle snapped and broke. Had replaced.

AC compressor pulley was making loud chirping noise. Dealer told me that they had to replace the Compressor. This was pre-winter (November). They got the part in about a week and then replaced it. I didn't check it because it was to cold to run it that time of year in Virginia.

Driver seat was making this annoying squeeking noise. The dealer ordered me an entire Leather power seat and replaced it for me. Now that is service!!

Car seems to be a little loose on the road. Drive not as smooth. Dealer rotated wheels, didn't help. Dealer also let me know that they don't get paid very well from KIA on the warranty work and that they don't like working with these cars at all. This didn't make me feel very confident about my great warranty. The warranty is only as good as the mechanics working on your car.(and their willingness)

Spring is Here!!Spring is Here!! It's the best time of the year!! Well the KIA got through the winter just great. It really drove well in the snow! It was very solid in this environment. I was very happy with it on this level. I Think the large curb weight helps in this capacity.

It's getting hot here in Virginia now so I turned on my AC and lo-and-behold my brand new compressor is blown out. I'm blowing hot air. I take it to the dealer and they say it's fine. They are also transferring the dealership title to the Hyundai dealer up the road in a few days. I wonder why they said it was fine? Do you? They don't want to deal with it thats why, obviously. I have to wait now until they get settled in over at the Hyundai dealer. Bummer.

The service manager at the previous dealership used me as a confessional booth and let it all out.

He has one lady with a Sedona that is in a lemon law buyback situation with KIA. She has had electrical problems that have blown out her computer more than 3 times. They have replaced a few transmissions on the Sedonas around town. Etc. Etc. He did say that the Sedona is KIA's best car though. He told me that all of their other cars are complete disasters.

I hope our story helps. I like our Sedona but am leery about the future with it. The resale value is a scary issue with it also. It does drive good and we feel safe in it and that is important. I probably would have been better off buying a 2nd hand 4x4 suburban, at least I would have had some room for things after all of the kids are packed in.

Good Luck,
