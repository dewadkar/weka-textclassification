            I needed a new car and my 267,000 mile jeep had to go. I needed something that would fit both dogs, bikes and all my other crap. I only considered a volvo since my SO wanted one.  I agreed to go to the dealer and wow , the people at the dealership were totally different than any other dealership. I looked and drove the car and I loved it. However, I needed to think about it since this car does have a station wagon image. I thought about it and I still really liked it. When I told the salesman how I felt, he understood and let me go without the typical snake-in-the-grass tactics. I was impressed with the buying experience but I thought this might just be my dealer. I went to two other dealerships and I got the same no hassle treatment. I  eventually bought the car through the &quot;car store&quot; via my credit union and they sent me back to the dealership that I had visited first. Between the time that I bought the car I test drove the Audi A4 Avant and the Subaru Outback. I decided on the the Volvo for the following reasons:
   A4 - too small and almost the same price as the Volvo but without the reputation.
   A6 - too big and more way more $$$ than the Volvo.
When I think of Audi I still can't shake thier '80s image of unreliable cars. 
  Outback - To get the same features as my Volvo , I would of needed to spend at least 26k and that seemed like a lot for Subaru. Additionally, all of the Subaru dealers were cheese-balls.

The Volvo wasn't without quirks though. After leaving the dealership the windshield needed to be re-sealed and the speedometer sensor was bad. Aside from that no problems.  I was a little bummed my first week but the car really grows on you. I get over double the MPG from my SUV. You can literally sit in these seats all day and when it is cold the seat warmers are great. 

The best thing about this car is that I never worry about putting on too many miles. I hope to have this at least as long as my 267,000 jeep. And I'll live w/ the station wagon image; this car is cool ! <br><br>
