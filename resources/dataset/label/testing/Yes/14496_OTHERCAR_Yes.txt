            I bought my 1999 Hyundai Sonata based upon the looks, ride and features of the vehicle.  I really love the pick-up the V-6 engine has, and I still think it's one of the best looking bodies, especially from the back.  The new design on the brake lights is very attractive.

The only thing I don't like about this car is the emergency braking abilities.  More than once, in a situation where I've needed to stop quickly, I felt like I wouldn't.  I have even rear ended a car going 15 m.p.h., with two car lengths to stop.  The damage to my car was UNBELIEVABLE.  Over $9,000 for a 15 m.p.h. wreck.  Due to the fact the car has an aluminum engine block, there was extra damage.  My personal feeling is that the car would be safer if they fixed the emergency braking and made it a little more crunch proof.

The car has a very nice ride, better than a Camry (owned one) or an Altima (rented one).  

I would suggest this vehicle for families, yet suggest they remember about the brakes and follow at least three car lengths behind others while driving.  Unfortunately, it hasn't proven to be an extremely safe car.<br><br>
