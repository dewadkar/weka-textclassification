            I bought me Jeep used about two years ago because a friend of mine had one and I really loved it.  I've been really happy with my Jeep ever since I first bought it.  

Its versatility is a big plus for me.  I work as a professional photographer so I often have lots of camera and lighting gear to haul around.  The rear seat folds down easily to increase the capacity in the back.  The back seat is also large enough to easily seat 3 people.  With the optional roof rack you can haul even more.  

It's also been very reliable in every situation.  For example, I've used my car on the job to chase pictures of dangerous flooding conditions.  Other times I'll find myself on dirt roads somewhere.  My driving needs are pretty unpredictable, but the Jeep hasn't failed me once. I drive it heavily.   I've taken it on three 1,300 mile road trips since I've gotten it.  No problems. 

I've had very minor repairs since I've gotten it however.  The rear window sprayer failed and I had that fixed.  The light illuminating my AC controls had died.

On the whole I love my car and probably would get another Cherokee in the future.
