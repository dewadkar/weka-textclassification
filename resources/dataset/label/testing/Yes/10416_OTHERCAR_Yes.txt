            I've had a Grand ownership experience sofar with my '98 5.9 Limited (the only year they made them with that engine).  Before buying it, I test drove the much more expensive Mercedes ML430 (about $50,000) and was even more convinced that the Jeep is a better vehicle, with better seats, steering and power.  In fact, I bought mine with a year and 5600 miles on it for only $25,300 (nearly half the price of the Mercedes) because the owner had to get rid of it.  It was $38,000 new!  I've since put over 9,000 great miles on it.

I bought it because I love power and this is one of the most powerful SUVs out there; I added a K&amp;N air intake system (it took about 40 minutes) which adds another 25 horsepower with no mileage penalty.  It also has exceptionally comfortable seats and a terrific set of options, especially options not available on any other GC, even the 2000 model, like a 10 speaker stereo, color keyed hood louvers, ground effects, chrome shift handle and exhaust tip, beautiful 5 spoke rims, etc., which all set it apart, making it look almost custom because they're not that common.  It also has a great balance of ride and handling because it's a unibody design and not based on a trucklike frame like most SUVs.  It has a really rugged full time AWD system and is very well made.  I actually have gone off roading a few times and it has performed flawlessly.  It is also very easy to maintain. I do all my own work and most maintenance (oil, trans fluid changes, etc.) can be done without a jack!  It drives really well in all weather and the 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS do a great job with good pedal feel.  I also like the luxury car amenities, like heated seats, electronic climate control, exceptional stereo, etc.  On top of all that, it can carry tons of stuff between the roof rack and the cargo area (with the spare tire removed.)  It is also relatively easy to park with the big mirrors and without the huge size of a Navigator or Land Cruiser.

I do have a few dislikes.  Fuel economy is definitely number one.  I get about 14 MPG mixed driving and the big engine requires premium fuel.  The full size spare tire has sat in my garage since I bought it because it used up a lot of valuable cargo space.  I carry a can of fix-a-flat instead.  The interior quality is not up to the rest of the vehicle.  One of the simulated wood pieces is off-color and the headrest mounts for the back seat always come off when I put it down.  Also, the drivetrain makes a slight humming noise between 20 and 40 MPH.  These are really minor quips compared to the GC's overall performance and utility.

While I have low mileage, I have had zero problems.  I have heard some bad stories, but this was the last model year of that style GC and they've had plenty of time to work any bugs out.  I've had no leaks, squeaks or rattles, and have never been to the shop, but I am very meticulous when it comes to maintenance.  You are supposed to change the transmission and axle fluid every 12,000 miles, which most people don't do.  I also use synthetic fluid and oil only.  I'm sure that many problems would be avoided if people followed the maintenance recommendations right in the owner's manual and used good quality lubricants, not gas station stuff.

I would definitely recommend this SUV or another late model Limited with a V8 if a 5.9 isn't available.  If you are looking for an all purpose, all weather vehicle, I don't think there is a better choice within tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br>
