            Kona - the first time a bike came with a car as an accessory!  Ford's Limited addition Kona of a Focus really caught my eye.  I felt a little pressured to buy it from the salesman, but glad I did.  The Kona Focus is a ZX3 with the works.  Besides - attached to the top is a bike rack complete with a Kona mountain bike called the blast.  And what a blast it is.  It is a fast bike with front disk breaks.  

The limited addition comes in two colors, a hunter green color and a metalic color called Dirt.  It is a golden beige color and matches the bike.  It also has black side mouldings that look like tire treads.  It comes with special seat covers and floor mats with the Kona logo on them.
The low profile tires add to it's looks.  This car also has a telescoping stearing wheel and a drivers seat that cranks up and down.  That lets you adjust everything to match your driving comfort.  The car came with a single CD player and an anti theft system. You just remove the font panel and take it with you.

The car is exceptional.  Plenty of head and leg room.  No wonder it is North America's car of the year.  Plenty of room to haul stuff too.  The back seats fold down for additional hauling space.  The car is very responsive on the road.

I did fill up my first tank of gas and only got 23 miles to the gallon.  It is suppose to get around 31.  I did have the air conditioning running all the time, so that probally has effected the gas mileage.  By the way, the air conditioner works great.  I live in a very hot and humid place and the air conditioner worked great.

One last thing, no tune up for 100,000 miles.  Plus you can buy the extended warranty which is great for those of us who have no desire to worry about the car repairs. It also comes with roadside assistance!    <br><br>
