            I bought the 2000 Acura TL in May.  Although it took a month to get, it has been everything I could have imagined.  Here are some of the key features I like:

- Luxurious interior.  If you're like me, you look beyond simply speed when looking at a car.  The TL is decked out--excellent leather, fine wood trim, nice curves.  One of my friends, who bought a Mercedes SUV, commented on how nice the leather was compared to his more expensive car.

- Great Sound System.  I'm not too particular here, but this car features an excellent Bose system.  Although the TL doesn't come with a CD changer, it includes a casette player and a 4 disc CD holder.

- Nice &quot;Gadgets&quot;.  This includes an automatic dimming mirror, Xenon lights, sunglass holder, 3 button garage/gate opener, rear set cup holders, nifty hidden front seat cup holders, a couple power outlets, adjustable middle console arm rest, TipTronic shifting, and more.

One drawback is the the gas mileage isn't wonderful.  I get an average of 18-19 MPG as a combo of city and highway driving.  It requires premium gas.  With today's prices, this is a bummer.

Here's the bottom line.  This is the first car I've ever bought.  I've driven a family member's car, but this is the first purchase I've made.  I searched long and hard.  BMW.  Lexus.  VW.  After taking an objective look at all of them, I went for the Acura TL.  Other than the terrible dealership that lied to me about delivery time (don't buy your car in Austin, TX!), it has been a wonderful experience.<br><br>
