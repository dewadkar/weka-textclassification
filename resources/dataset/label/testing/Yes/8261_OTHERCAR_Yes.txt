            Ever since I saw the movie "Can't Buy Me Love," I always wanted a white convertible VW Rabbit, but I couldn't afford one as a teenager.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was horrid, but the car was cool and unfortunately no amount of whining or charm could convince dad to buy it for me.  What did I get instead?  A 1983-ish Ford Fiesta.  That's right, I said "Fiesta" not "Festiva" and yes, I'm sure about that.

Anyway, when I graduated from college I had an opportunity to purchase a blue 1991 Cabriolet with a white top and black & white interior.  It wasn't exactly my teenage dream car, but I jumped at the opportunity nonetheless.  Today my car has well over 102,000 miles on it, and it runs great.  The only down side is that the parts can be expensive.  Last winter I had a broken idle stabilizer valve and the part alone cost me $225.  It was money well spent though, because now it runs like the little champ that it is, except I think I might have a slight oil leak -- is that a problem?  Just kidding, I know -- I married Bob Villa's illegitimate love-child.

Since you can't buy this model new anymore (they turned the Cabriolet into the Cabrio, with more of a fishbowl design that I'm not fond of) I'm considering buying another car soon and keeping this one as my summer toy, restoring my Cabriolet to it's original style.  A couple things to keep in mind if you buy this car -- the '91 Cabriolet is not compatible with today's computerized diagnostic checks, so if something breaks down in the engine your mechanic will have to do a manual search for the problem.  This could keep your car in the shop for a good amount of time, but the time and money spent fixing the problem are worth it.  My recommendation -- find a mechanic that specializes in foreign cars, VWs specifically, so they fix it right the first time.

Also, someone who is mechanically inclined once told me that all VWs, no matter what model, have an electrical quirk of some sort.  I can't speak for other models or even other Cabriolets, but mine definitely has a quirk.  When using the power windows, you can only use one at a time.  For example, if I'm putting my window down and my passenger wants to put his window down, he can only do so when I've got my window where I want it.  Isn't this strange?  I was thinking about having my favorite VW mechanic take a look at this, but it isn't hurting the car so why waste the money?

Probably my most favorite thing about this car (besides the fact that the top comes down) is that the tires are really wide.  I mean, those suckers are seriously fat.  Living in Wisconsin where the winters can be brutal and long, it's been extremely helpful to have big fat tires on such a lightweight, compact car.  The only time I've ever had a problem driving it in the winter was when the roads were icy, and then even SUVs were out of control.  Here's a tip: if you find yourself with a Cabriolet in snowy regions, stuff the cute little trunk in the back with heavy "just in case" supplies like a bag of salt/sand, a compact shovel, a thick blanket, etc.  You'll probably never need them, but it'll give you a bit more weight on those snowy days.

Additionally, word is that this is a Chick Car, and no self-respecting, butt-scratching, woman-loving man would drive it.  I'm not kidding -- there was actually a survey taken on Chick Cars and the Cabriolet/Cabrio models were voted #1 all-time Chick Cars.  My joy in that I own THE Chick Car exists on several levels -- 1) My husband won't drive it, so my seat is never moved and there is never odd garbage strewn about, 2) Men automatically assume that the driver of my car is a female (which I am) and they always shoot me a "hey hotty" vibe when the top is down, and sometimes when it's not, 3) All my girlfriends understand the power of the Chick Car and will sacrifice perfect 'dos for the opportunity to flirt with strange men at high speeds, 4) It's probably the most feminine thing about me (actually, that last one is sort of sad).

One complaint I definitely have is that the vinyl top and leather seats are white -- yuck, especially since they're so hard to keep clean.  I tried to scrub them white myself a couple summers ago with every vinyl and leather cleaner on the market.  Some products cleaned a spot here and there, but nothing turned them back to total white and I broke a nail really far up which didn't feel good when the chemicals soaked into the wound.  My next step is to let the professionals take a whack at it, and if that doesn't work I'll be looking into replacements -- but black this time, not white.

Because this is an older model, it doesn't have all the great comforts you can get in even the least expensive autos on today's market.  But hey, it's a convertible and it's really cool looking!  The only thing that would make me trade this baby in is if VW ever releases a convertible version of the new Beetle.
