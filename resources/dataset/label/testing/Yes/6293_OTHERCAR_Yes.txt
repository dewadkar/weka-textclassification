            My husband and I bought this car used just 6 months ago to replace a 1985 Toyota Camry and a 1988 Dodge minivan. It replaces both of those vehicles very well. With 2 kids under 3, we weren't quite big enough for the minivan, but too small for the Toyota. We were also looking for better gas mileage than the van. We looked at many makes and models in the mid-size sedan category, and felt very fortunate to find this Corsica in excellent condition.

Things I Love About This Car:
- Can fit my tandem stroller plus much more in the trunk.
- Interior is extremely kid friendly (red)- cleans up very well. Seats are soft and fairly wide. 
- Easy handling. Very quiet. 
- No major repairs. Only repair at all has been to replace a battery (had been replaced by previous owner with a DieHard, and the posts fell off. Strangest thing. Anyway, not a reflection on the car.)
- Previous owner had no major repairs either.
- V6 really gets up and goes, but still gets great gas mileage.
- Came with cruise, air, tilt wheel and seats, auto, power windows and locks. 
- Split rear seat with trunk access. Hardly use it because of car seats, but very handy when we actually have been able to haul long items as needed.

Things I would Change:
- Controls for power windows are between front seats and feel like they are placed in wrong order (back windows in top position, front on bottom). Driver side has automatic full open, but not auto full close.
- Seats could be a little easier to move back and forth.
- I sometimes have trouble opening the hood. The latch doesn't always release fully.
- Better cup holder placement. I am always running into them (they extend from the area above the glove box) Good news, they retract when not in use.
- More glove box space.

Again, let me say, I hate to see this car go, but it won't fit our growing family.
