                A little history first, I was a 16(now 17) year old who wanted to get a Jaguar for his first car. So I went to the dealer and he first looked at me as if I was an idiot because I was a kid asking to drive a 70K+ dollar car. Well he changed his mind, and I test drove a XJR. I have to say, it was great, the supercharged engine was smooth, the car looked lovely form both inside and out, but a little problem arose. It was kind of cramped. I thought it was just me, because I was used to my mother's Acura and Mercedes. But it was still really cramped. Although I really loved the car, I just could not sit in it for too long without getting kind of fatigued. So I say to the dealer I will think about it and go home. On the way I pick up a Dupont Registry Top 100 cars. As I went through it I came upon the BMW 8 series. I really liked it and always wanted a V12 car, so set out looking for one. It turns out that they are not as common as you would expect in PA, so frustrated, I look for a 750, not really knowing what it looked like, just knowing that it had a the same big V12. I happen to come upon one near my home, and set out to see it with my parents. It turns out they had both a 740 and a 750 and we tested both. when I stepped inside the 750, I knew that this was the car for me. The legroom was more than ample, something I couldn�t say for most cars, and the engine just purred. Luckily, my father agreed to buy it for me, and I got my first car, a BMW 750il. I never really appreciated it until I raced my friends, needless to say, 125mph was a fun speed to drive at, and the control was superb at even this high speed. 

    Real world driving shows that it has a number of qualities. First of all, its not a "head-turner," as my moms Mercedes is, even though new it costs almost twice as much. If you want it to be a head-turner, this can easily be done by employing very loud gangster rap. :) People look first kind of angrily and then with amazement. A second property is that its great as not only a highway cruiser, but an everyday car, in that it is very comfortable, though gas prices now are making this less likely  :(. 

    A little commented problem is with the sound system, though 14 speakers are great, the 4 subs are very, very bad, and the base is very, very bad. This can easily be fixed though be adding 4 12 inch subs in the truck. This problem doesn�t bother most people, but modern rap sounds less based in the car. (UPDATE: Actualy I finally checked the car and the problem is not the subs, rather it is the incredible amount of insulation in the car. Sitting in the back seats when the stock base on moderately high, all you feel is the base, as opposed to the front seats where the base felt is much more mellow. Thus the ideal solution is not to add more subs in the trunk, resulting in even more 'base discomfort' for the rear seats, but rather smaller subs in the front seat driver & passenger foot rest area. This space is large, and after driving an NSX, losing half of it to subs is not a problem that causes any discomfort, as the area is still quite large even with subs in custom boxes that are made to look sort of like wheel wells (If you ever sat in a Ferrari Testarossa and saw the subs, thats sort of what these subs look like, but on a smaller scale and without taking up so much space).)   

    Worried about getting your car stolen? No problem, as not only does it have all the normal anti-theft stuff, but an internal motion detector and break resistant glass (optional). 

    Although size can be a problem, the PDC, or parking distance control is really handy, and has never let me down.

    Reliability is very good, though its check engine light loves to be on. It doesn�t hamper driving. (UPDATE: After three times in about 5 months the light being on for minor problems (minor leak in cylinder bank one, carbon build up, sensor), the car has provided me with no problems after that. For the record, it has more reliable (and cheaper to maintain) than my Honda/Acura NSX, and its a Honda!)  

    In final analysis, it is ideal for driving without getting noticed, although sometimes I wish it had the v12 markings all over it like the S600, just so people now who they are dealing with :). It is a great first car, as it is not a real sports car, and it has enough safety systems to prevent my parents from worrying too much. It�s comfortable as I am relatively tall at 6 2 and this makes driving many cars an exercise in endurance (Mercedes MLs anyone?). The BMW can easily accommodate me, with extra room too spare, as well as all my family and friends. It is a good entry car as it allows you to become familiar with V12 cars without losing comfort(or reliablity, for that matter) as in many sport V12 cars.

    Pricing for the cars is very good too, as used ones are relatively inexpensive in comparison to new cars, and the certified used cars is mostly better than other used cars.

    Two final notes, for those of you who read my '98 Rangerover review, I have a theme song for this car too, it is "I need a Resoluton"'s instrumental by Aliyah. I don't like the song itself, but the insrutmental sounds simply wonderful in the 7. The second thing is that I will eventually update this review in the new, and much better, style of my car reviews when I am free
