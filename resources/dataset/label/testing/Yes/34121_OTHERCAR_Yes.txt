            I bought this vehicle for the cost initially, but have been impressed with its performance over the past couple years.  Besides some general maintenance I have never had a problem with this car.  
The Shadow handles great and the gas mileage is really good.  The layout of the interior was really thought out and everything is very convenient.
I would recommend this car to students and to young couples looking for a good car with great value.
Please consider a car with cruise control as I found that a bit of a draw back on my car.
Over time and with a bit of research, I have found out that the manufacturer had some problems on the paint job on this model of Dodge car.  After a few years, chips of paint frequently coming of the car were quite noticable and more frequent.  I did not drive this car on gravel enough to warrant the damage to the paint, and agree with others that the paint was a problem on this model.  Apparently there is a recall of some models due to the paint problem.
Overall I would rate this car very highly for someone looking for a practical car, with affordable add on options.<br><br>
