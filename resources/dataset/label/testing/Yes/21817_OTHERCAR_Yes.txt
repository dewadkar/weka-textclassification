            The 1991 model of the Chevrolet Blazer in my opinion, is the greatest model to date. The massive 4.3 liter V6 gets with the program. Great power, great acceleration and decent overall fuel economy round out this great truck. It is very capable off-road and seems to never get stuck, even in the deepest mud. The traction is phenomenal on any terrain. Surprisingly agile for an SUV, the handling is very tight. It makes you feel completely in control of the truck. The interior is very comfortable and spacious. It makes you feel safe while in the vehicle. Driving it is a pleasure; the transmission shifts smoothly and the engine runs great. A great truck if you are a teenager like myself who likes a nice looking truck-based SUV capable of off-road conditions, hauling around friends and cargo, and driving around town. The 1991 models stunning good looks is sure to turn heads if kept in good condition.<br><br>
