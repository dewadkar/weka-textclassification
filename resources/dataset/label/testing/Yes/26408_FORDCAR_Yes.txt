            We bought a used '96 Ford Windstar because it was what we could afford at the time.  We looked at others, including the Dodge Grand Caravan, and the Chrystler Town &amp; Country, but they were more expensive.  We have been pleased with Ford products in the past (we had a 89ï¿½ Escort), and decided to go with it.  It drives well, a little rough, but I believe that's the nature of vans.  I really like the extra length in the back, and the dual air system.  The only drawback I have found with our windstar - and we're coming up on 70,000 miles - is the lack of a second door on the driver side.  It's hard to buckle up two small children in that middle seat who are still in car seats.  Other than that, I think it is a very versatile and practical car for a young family.<br><br>
