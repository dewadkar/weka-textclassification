            I bought a Monte Carlo Z34 which now is the SS.  Same car though so listen up.  This is as good as it gets for this price level.  It accelerates very quickly, rides smoothly and quietly and has plenty of room inside.  I got all the options because I think the moon-roof and leather interior make the car.  I will be honest and tell you all the two, and only, things I don't like about this vehicle.  It gets not so great gas mileage for a non real sports car V6.  And, it corners and handles like hell for this type of car.  There.  Those being said I can go back to my high praises.  I love this car and everything about it from its sleek styling to the kick ass pick up down to the wide road gripping tires, abs brakes and air bags to keep you safe as you drive like a maniac.  <br><br>
