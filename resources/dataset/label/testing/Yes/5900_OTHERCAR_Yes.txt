            I have had the privilege of driving two dodge 1500 series trucks. Both were company vehicles and were used for heavy duty construction work. We would haul 55 gallon drums of fuel and oil, wood planks, and other supplies. They were also used to haul large augers, or drill bits, for 60,000 lb. drilling rigs. Most of the time the trucks were on the road for long distances and then used on back-roads and off-road situations to get to the drilling sites. These trucks proved to be very reliable and tough. The only problems I encountered were the bolts sliding out from the center folding console. These were easily tightened as I should have done it when I first noticed the problem. There were no other troubles. I found the radio and cd system to be more than impressive(especially for those long trips!!). This truck is also very comfortable to ride in. I had a long bed two wheel drive and now a short-bed 4 wheel off-road truck. Each of those vehicles were very smooth and provided a very enjoyable experience. Both had the 318 under the hood and this provided more than enough power. My boss has the turbo diesel and it is truly awesome. That thing screams. I mean up to the limit that is :). For a rugged, tough, hard-working, fast-driving vehicle look no further than a Dodge!!!<br><br>
