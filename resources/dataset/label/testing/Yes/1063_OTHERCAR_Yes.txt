            I have also owned 2 Jeeps (87 Jeep Laredo and 94 Grand Cherokee Limited) and leased my most recent 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  I just can't leave Jeep.  It is a great vehicle which has come a long way.  I love the way it drives - it is a smooth, side to side movement rather than the Ford Explorer which has a stiff, front to back motion.  I can't say that I have ever had a major problem with my vehicles.  As long as you maintain it with scheduled services and oil changes it will last a long time.  It is very reliable in the snow.  I have never gotten stuck.  A lot of people think that it will be good for ice but as with any car you have to be careful.  I like being high up.  I can see a lot farther than being in a regular car which I think is better driving.  With my 98 I got all the options - leather seats; sunroof; etc etc which I think I might have done better if I leased a Limited but the Laredo was the popular car at the dealers at the time which meant that the sales person made out.  As with some older models I have never had a problem with the quality of paint.  My 87 was burgundy and 94 was black - each stayed in perfect condition.  I have a friend who has a 94 Ford Explorer - the clear coat is cracked and the paint is awful looking.  My recommendation is to keep the outside washed and waxed.  My friends are so used to me driving a Grand Cherokee they can't see me in anything else.  It is the perfect size.  Not too big and not too small.  I don't think that it eats up too much gas - I have a V8 which sometimes I can go for 10 days w/o having to fill it again.  It is not as good as my V6 but I love the pep that they both have!<br><br>
