            I had been in need of a second vehicle, as my two-wheel
drive pickup didn't cut it in terms of winter/wet weather
driving, nor in MPG.  I gave strong consideration to the
Japanese offerings, especially the Impreza (with its AWD,
it would be ideal for my NJ weather).  Besides the big
difference in price (comparable Japanese models were at
least $3000 more), none of the small foreign cars could
accomodate my 6-0 size.  Not to my satisfaction anyway.

So I narrowed my search down to the Cavalier, 
Sunbird/Sunfire, and Ford Escort & zx2.  The interiors of
the 1995 and newer Cavalier/Sunfire didn't appeal to me,
and the Escort/zx2 reliability records weren't reassuring.
This led me to the 1991 - 1994 body style 
Cavaliers/Sunbirds.

Given that with these models we're talking about 8 - 11 year
old vehicles, it was tough finding a well-preserved 
specimen.  But, after driving some, I knew this was what I
wanted.  I needed an automatic, and the V6 models gave good
power, but I wanted MPG.  So my target was a 4 cyl.  After
much searching, I found a one-owner RS with 47,500 miles
on it.

I've owned it for 1000 miles now, and here's what I can say:
The consumer magazines poo-poo these cars on fit & finish,
but given what these cars went for when new, and what they
cost now, the fit & finish is acceptable.  On my car, the
driver's side power door lock didn't work, nor did the
driver's side map light button.  My other "complaints"
would be that the controls for the radio and climate control
are too far away, but otherwise the layout and quality is 
fine.

The car handles well, and with a 70% highway 30% city
driving split, I am averaging 28 mpg on 89 octane gas.  This
is good enough for me.  Power on the little 4-banger is not
blistering, but depending on how well the car was 
maintained, it is by no means as slow as a Metro or Kia.
That's it for now, I'll keep you all posted as I gain more
experience with this vehicle.
