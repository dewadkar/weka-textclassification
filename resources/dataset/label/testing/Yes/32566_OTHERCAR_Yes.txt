            I have been driving a Saturn SL since 1997, and I will never again settle for anything less.  I love the car, but it's the service that has made me a Saturn-fanatic.

When I decided to trade in my VW Vanagon for something smaller, I went to Volkswagen because I had always been happy with their product.  They made me an offer on the Vanagon, and I priced the Jetta.  Then I decided to go out to the Saturn dealer and see what all the hype was about.  Am I glad I did!  They offered me a much better deal on my trade-in, and I didn't have to go through the New Car Waltz that I had just been through at Volkswagen--you know, when the salesman says I-can-do-this-if-you-will sign-this and you say But-I-don't-want-that-what-if... and he says I'll-see-what-my-manager-says...ad nauseum.  At Saturn, they were up front about everything, and so pleasant to work with.  I ordered my Saturn on the spot.  

But the proof of the pudding came last year, when my battery went dead while I was at a restaurant.  I called their Roadside Assistance number, and a tow truck was there within 10 minutes.  They towed my car to the nearest Saturn dealership, where they were just closing for the night.  The Service Advisor immediately called the mechanics and asked them to stay open past closing to put in a new battery for me.  He said that the shuttle driver had already gone home, but that if there was something else wrong with my car and they couldn't get it out right then, he would personally take me home (20 miles out of his way, I might add).  They did get the battery changed with no problem, however, and I was on my way.

The next day I took the car to the other Saturn dealership in town, just to have a check of the alternator, etc.  When they found out we were a one car family, they offered not only to drive us home while they worked on the car, but also to come to our home and pick us up when it was ready!!  I had never heard of that kind of service before.  When I think about the borderline rude service that I have encountered at some other car dealers over the years, I can't believe that it took me so long to get a Saturn.
