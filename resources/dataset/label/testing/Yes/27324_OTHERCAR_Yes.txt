            We finally found the right SUV for us!  We owned the GMC Jimmy and loved it, but we needed just a bit more power and room.  We bought a new 2000 model.  Flame Red!  I'm here to tell you that we get sooo many looks with that color!  We ended up getting the heavy duty service group for towing.  We have a 20 foot boat and we feel better about towing it now.  The Jimmy towed it just fine, but I think in the long run it would have taken it's toll on it.  The inside of this truck is amazing!  They definitely utilized space.  There are cup holders everywhere in this thing too.  When we first got it my brothers friend had to climb way back into the 3rd seat to see if he fit.  Now mind you he is about 6'3&quot; or more and he said it really wasn't that bad!  He wouldn't sit there for a long trip, but he would for a trip across town.
I like the little hidden compartment way in the back.  I put my ice scraper back there and other odds and ends that would end up banging around on the inside.  We also have the rear air.  My step son can now ride with his own climate control!  He doesn't have to sit in the middle of the seat with our vents blowing back at him.  That is a very nice feature if you have kids.  It drives like a dream.  It doesn't handle or feel like a &quot;truck&quot; at all.  I feel like a queen when I'm driving.  From my personal experience I think this beats all other SUV's hands down.  Oh and one other thing, the turning radius is incredible.  If you are at all apprehensive about driving something bigger and still being able to get in and out of parking spots with ease then have no fear.  It turns on a dime!<br><br>
