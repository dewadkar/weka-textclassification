            If you are thinking about buying a new car, definitely check into a Saturn!  First of all, buying a Saturn is a new and unusual automobile buying experience.  Instead of playing the money game with salesman after salesman and finally the manager like usually happens at a car dealership - at Saturn you start and finish with the same person.  They don't play the money games - the cost is the cost.  

This was a wonderful experience for me, as I absolutely hate playing the game.  We walked in, we looked around, we talked to the salesman - we went home with our car.  That was three years ago, and we still love it!

I have owned many vehicles in my life, and the Saturn is by far the best.  It has a smooth ride, gets decent gas mileage, and the front wheel drive allows the car to hug the road quite nicely.  It handles very well on icy roads, and is very reliable.

The model we have has posi-traction and anti-lock breaks.  I love it when I am driving along and the &quot;traction active&quot; light comes on - it tells me the road is slippery - something I may not have yet noticed.  The anti-lock brakes took some getting used to, but once I learned how they worked I was fine with them.

One of the biggest selling features for me on this car was safety.  Saturn is one of the safest cars on the market, and this was very important to me because I spend countless hours driving my children to and from different places.  I also like the way the value of the Saturn lasts.  Most cars depreciate quite rapidly - but not the Saturn.  Its value stays much higher for much longer.

I can highly recommend this car with no reservations - if you are looking for a car at least go out and test drive a Saturn - you will fall in love with it in no time flat!<br><br>
