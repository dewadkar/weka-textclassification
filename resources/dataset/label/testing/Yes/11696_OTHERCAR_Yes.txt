             I am currrently a proud owner of a 1997 model year Golf GTi VR6, and have but a few opinions about the car. My ownership so far has been nothing short of wonderful. However, there are a few points about the car that I do not like. 
First, and possibly most obvious to any other owners of this car are the OEM spec tires. The Goodyear Eagle GA is a nice tire for daily driving and commuting, but push the car a little into a corner and watch your rear end, because she'll come around on you if you're not careful.My car got some decent miles out of the first set, but I opted to change the tires at about 60k miles because I was no longer satisfied with the way the car reacted on curvy roads. A set of Dunlop D60A2's helped significantly. 
 Second is a minor but important feature that I think VW should have done to make the car a bit more liveable. The controls for the electric roof are nice, but you must hold down the button to open or close the roof. I think that VW should have used a switch that is a &quot;one-touch&quot; type, similar to the driver's side window controls, which allow opening of the window by just touching the button once. It's annoying to have to hold the button down, especially in heavy traffic, where the hands should be on the steering wheel.
 As far as performance of the car overall goes, I'm happy to say that I've done only two modifications to the car so far. I installed an aftermarket intake system to eliminate the VERY restrictive factory airbox/filter combination. Now when I lean on that big pedal, I hear a sweet, throaty growl from under the hood. This alone added roughly 5-7 extra HP. 
 I am not sure if it's in the way I drive, or the guy next to me in the 5.0 just can't figure out how I left him at the light, checking out my car from the rear, but I've made a bunch of local boys really angry with my baby. She does everything I ask of her, and I love her very much(my car, you know). 
 My overall recommendation for any future VW enthusiasts is &quot;GO OUT AND GET ONE!&quot; My only wish is a Mulberry VR6. I have yet to see one on the road since it is the color that was the most rare for 1997. Maybe someday I'll stumble onto one, and have to sell my black one to finance the deal!
