            I leased a 2000 4 door Jimmy a couple of months ago.  I wanted a slighter larger SUV than the compact versions available and yet I did not want a gas guzzler.  The 4 door Jimmy has plenty of cargo room, especially with the rear seats folded forward and ample ground clearance and yet is easy to enter and exit without the need for a running board (the running boards on most SUVs catch the middle of my calf or the front of my shin every time).  The SLE version is loaded with handy convenience features, such as plenty of cup holders, overhead console with map lights, a large driver's console, and privacy shield over cargo area.

I have found it to provide excellent traction in all types of terrain and foul weather conditions.  I selected the &quot;auto 4 wheel drive option&quot;, in addition to the full time 4 wheel drive button on this vehicle, as it eliminates guesswork as to when to select 4 wheel drive in less severe weather conditions, which might or might not require additional traction.

This vehicle is very comfortable on long trips.  Head and leg room
in the front are generous, and back seats are fairly comfortable, however not for large people on long drives.  Acceleration in highway driving with the Vortec 6 cyl engine is good.  Gas mileage is reasonable for a mid size SUV (around 16 mpg in combination city/highway driving.)  Ride is very good and road noise is fairly quiet.  The CD player is excellent.

Although I have only driven this vehicle for a couple of months (I leased it late last year), I have found it to be fun to drive (fairly nimble) and reliable.  I believe this is a very good mid-size, reasonably priced SUV that the whole family can enjoy, while at the same time having the peace of mind and versatility associated with a four (4 wheel) drive vehicle.<br><br>
