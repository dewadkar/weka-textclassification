            I bought my scoupe turbo when it was new in 1993 and I still have it.  Over the years it has proved to be extremely reliable.  Only recently have I had to replace the alternater on it and this was the first large item that needed to be replaced.  I have never broken down anywhere due to the car's fault.  That is, I have left the lights on and had to get the battery boosted but it has never broken down while I was driving.

I find the scoupe very comfortable for a sports coupe.  The seats are adjustable and have a lumbar support built in.  The ride is still smooth and the engine has a lot of get up and go.  It accelerates very well.  Inside, all of the buttons are easily reached.  My car has power everything and nothing has gone wrong with that aspect of the scoupe.

I did not opt for the rust proofing and my car is in excellent condition body-wise.  There is a tiny bit of rust around the exterior mirrors.  I think that it looks quite young for its age and price range.  

It also has great trunk space.  I recently moved and I was able to get a surprising number of boxes into the trunk.  The back seats are duel splitting so they extend trunk space when needed.

I have owned 3 Hyundais including the scoupe and have just bought a Sonata.  I have never had much trouble with any of the models and you get good value for your money.
