<TEXT>
            In 1993 my 1983 Toyota, which had over 120,000 miles on it was ready to be traded in. So, having had such a good experience all the years I drove it, I decided to go with another Toyota. I went to a reputable car dealership where a 1990 Toyota Corolla 4 door sedan caught my eye. I test drove it and decided it was the right car for me.

When I bought my Corolla, it had 48,000 miles on it and was 3 years old. I now have had it for 7 years and it is still going and keeps on going (kind of like the energizer bunny). I have always taken good care of it; oil changes every 3,000 miles, regular tune ups, etc. and in turn it has given me 7 great years of driving. Of course, I've had to do some repairs on it, like replace a fuel injector, muffler and some other minor repairs. 

But the best part of all, is that I haven't had a car payment for 4 years, ever since I paid it off. I have never broken down on the side of the road, even though I now have 125,000 miles on it. Maybe I'll be driving it when it's has 200,000 miles on it and is considered an antique! Oh well, you can't beat having no car payment and a car that just keeps on going...
