            It is going to be a sad day when my 1996 Honda Civic LX Sedan begins to die on me.

I chose this vehicle because I was raised on Hondas; my parents had them in my childhood, and the first car I ever drove was an '88 Accord that served me faithfully. Until I got this car, that is. My parents decided to get me a more reliable, newer vehicle as a high school graduation present, and the Honda Civic LX Sedan was on our short list.

My parents and I knew that this car would be a safe investment for those trips back and forth between college and my parents' house, and beyond. It wouldn't cost me a fortune in gas or maintenance, which is invaluable for college students and other people who are on a tight budget. My dad also loves Hondas because he tends to sell our cars every few years, and Hondas have low depreciation rates.

However, I won't let him sell my car! It is a joy to drive. It hugs curves, accelerates decently, and doesn't guzzle gas. I frequently get 35 mpg on the highway. While there is typical road noise when you get going on the highway, it's probably one of the quietest and most secure-feeling vehicles in its class and price-range. The steering is very accurate; I can make the smallest turning circles and fit into the tightest of parking spaces, all without getting my car nicked.

The acceleration can be a little sluggish because of the not-so-powerful engine, but if you want better acceleration and less fuel economy, you should probably check out one of the smaller Acuras (another line of cars built by Honda, it is the "high performance cousin" of the Honda).

Furthermore, it's attractive inside and out, with the typical Honda tastefulness. If a Honda looks tacky, it's probably due to after-market additions. My body style -- not too curvy, not too angular -- still looks fresh and clean today. It isn't modern anymore, per se, but it doesn't scream "1996!!!!" like some domestic cars do.

On the interior, seating is soft, tasteful and comfortable, although the support could be a little firmer for greater comfort on long drives. (Again, you would find more performance-oriented seating in an Acura.) Also, we've noticed that the front seats sometimes feel like they're leaning toward the center console when you've been on the road for awhile.

Controls, switches and dials are intuitive; if I let a friend drive my car, it doesn't take them very long to orient themselves. The cruise control is mounted on the steering wheel, for example, and the shifter is in the center console instead of behind the steering wheel.

The dashboard styling is smooth, simple, and non-distracting, and the finish is slightly textured and dull to avoid glare. The climate control is very good - the air conditioner gets cold quickly, the heater warms speedily on cold days, and the defogger clears misty windows fairly well if you know the correct settings to use.

If you're in the market for a very reliable compact car, used or new, and you don't mind spending a little extra for quality (and low depreciation in the long run), the Honda Civic should be on your short list.
