            We recently traded in our 1992 Geo Tracker. And although we bought something else nice with some more room we are still missing our cute little car. Our Tracker went for 77,000 miles and was eight years old before we had to trade it in. The biggest problem we ever had with it turned out to be its worst. Earlier this year the steering box went and a new one was to cost in excess of $1,000. We were told that certain parts for the Geo simply cost more than some other popular foreign cars or American made cars. So we opted to install a used steering box. But unfortunately it went again with in nine months. Thus we decided it was time to give up our beloved little car. Now that the Geo has been dropped and Chevrolet has taken the car over directly, the parts may cost less. And if we could have afforded a new Chevrolet Tracker, we would have certainly bought one!! Sure it was a noisy car on the highway and the wind tended to blow it around a bit, but it was part of its charm. And it's engine may have been a bit small, but it could back through snow up to it's bumper. That little car took us wherever we wanted to go and always got us home safe again. It never left us stranded!!! We highly recommend this car to anyone, especially if you can afford the newer Chevrolet version. We know that we will never forget our little Tracker!!<br><br>
