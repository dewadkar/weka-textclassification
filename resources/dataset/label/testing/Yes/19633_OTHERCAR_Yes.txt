            I bought the Toyota Celica in May 2001.  At the time, I managed to get an amazing 3.7% financing rate and $1400 cdn off the invoice price of the car.

What attracted me to this model is the same thing that has me smiling when I drive it today - cutting edge styling.

I have had more than one passerby comment on what a nice car it is which is actually quite a positive comment considering the price range of the car (affordable).  I have now put on about 5000 km on this car and have had great experience with it.

Positives include good "pull" at low end and very responsive handling.  The 5 speed manual is smooth and relatively short shifting.  Interior room is comfortable (front seats) although the back seats are a bit cramped.  Trunk space is more than adequate for this class of car and since this is a Toyota, quality is not a concern when it concerns build.

For 2001 (although most people don't point this out), there are a few minor changes including more sound proofing in the dash and the ability to buy different options (namely ABS on the base GT).  Of course, this may differ as I bought the car in Canada.

The cons I've had about this car which have been echoed by others include a) plastic which is scratch prone and not quite as durable as some competititors, b) poor rear visibility especiallly with the rear spoiler c) lack of an adjustable lumbar support and d) the appearance of strong competitors including the new 2002 Acura RSX and Subaru Impreza.

Unless Toyota does something to the car, it will be trumped at every level by the Acura RSX (except the styling) at this point including price, horsepower, base features and torque.

Come'on Toyota, do something to meet the challenge!

Otherwise, I am happy to have this car and it brings a smile to my face when I drive it daily.


UPDATE Feb 18, 2002

After 8 months, I still love the car.  I've put on 23,000 km on it and it hasn't given me any real problems other than a fuse shorting on the cigarette lighter (replaced by the dealer) and routine oil changes.

The only negative that has come up is that since this is a sporty 4-cylinder, it is a little noisy at highway speeds.  I really do wish that the GT came with a six-speed shifter since that would really cut down on engine noises when going faster than 100 km/h.

It certainly is not deafening but compared to a regular sedan accord/camry class, it is quite  a bit louder and can become annoying.
