            Cavaliers have been around for quite awhile, and the 98 Cavalier Z24 is part of GM/Chevy's third generation of the Cavalier name. Built for economy, you're getting what you're paying for.

The Z24 is classified as a sports compact car, but lets not confuse that with sports car. With an 2.4litre I4 engine sporting 150hp (35 more then the 2.2litre engine standard in cavaliers) and 155ft/lbs of torque, the car moves quite quickly given its light weight. It is quick, as quick as any other sports compact (see Honda Civic SI) but its still no sports car. It is a cavalier first, and a z24 second.

The car also sports a upgraded suspension package which offers a firmer grip on the road to improve handling. This also makes the daily ride a bit more painful, but is a sacrifice you make. A dual tip exhaust, side moldings, and a spoiler are also standard in the z24 package.

This car is cheap, you really cant purchase a sports compact for much less than you can the z24. So it really shouldn't come as any suprise that although performace is good, quality is lacking. I don't count this as a strike against the car, however, because it is built and sold as a cheap car. If the same problems were evident on a Lexus, I would be quite angry.

Problems i've encountered include sloppy engine mounts, a cheap transmission (in the manual version) which isnt very stable, and horrible problem with the water pump which causes them to go around 30-50k miles. This wouldn't normally be bad, but the GM engineers put the water pump in such a spot that it normally costs about $600 to be repaired. Be sure to have this checked befor purchasing one of these cars.

The Cavalier Z24 has been fun to drive, and apart from the work i've had to put into it the car has been very good. I'm not suprised about the work, I bought a cheap car and i'm going through the normal process. I also wish the car had a way to pop the trunk from inside, but it doesn't.
