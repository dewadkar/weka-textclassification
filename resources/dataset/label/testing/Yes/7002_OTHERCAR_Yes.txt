            I've recently purchased the HP C500 camera and am very impressed with it's overall quality.  I found it to be easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.

The controls are fairly easy to use and well placed.  Other digital cameras I have used require you to remember combinations of cryptic buttons in order to get to the settings you desire.  This camera makes it easier to change the most used settings, including individual buttons for flash settings and resolution.  Also, the dial makes it easy to select what mode the camera is set in (Review pictures, Take pictures, download to computer, etc).  I found the display menus to be a little bit confusing though, because the menu options varied, depending on what mode the camera was in.  

The quality of the pictures produced by the C500 camera on higher resolution settings is excellent.  When printed on photo paper, I could barely tell it was a digital photograph (at 8 1/2&quot; by 11&quot;).

The major shortcoming of this camera is that it drains batteries extremely fast.  When I first started using it, I thought the batteries provided were defective.  After buying several more batteries (NiMH), I realized it was the camera.  One thing to slow down this drain, is not to use the display.  This kind of defeats one of the biggest benefits of having a digital camera (instant review).  I would recommend keeping several sets of charged batteries on hand while using this camera and purchasing the separate power cord (to download to computer).

The Jet send feature (infra red download to computer) is a neat idea, but not so practical.  It is much faster to just remove the memory card and plug it into a reader.<br><br>
