            I own a 97 4-door Geo Tracker.  I love my little Tracker, but wish I would have waited for the Chevy Trackers to come out.  Recently the heater core went out in my Tracker and I took it to a Chevy Dealer for repairs.  After seven weeks and over $3,000 damage, I finally got my Tracker back.  The dealer told me afterwards that they don't usually work on Geo products.  

My Geo is smaller in comparison to the new Chevy Trackers.  Being a small SUV, it does not handle as well on the road as the larger Chevy Trackers.  We bought this vehicle because we liked the way it handled on the road, but after test driving a Chevy Tracker, I would love to eventually own a Chevy Tracker.<br><br>
