            I bought this camera in Qatar while on R&R during Operation Iraqi Freedom cause I was sick of paying for film. I bought the camera for $279 and I actually at the time thought it was a somewhat of a bargain. The camera has a lot of features some of which the beginner digital photographer will never use. The camera is just bigger than a pack of cigarettes and feels quite solid with it's all metal body. Sony didn't forget about quality with this camera. I have had it in Iraq for almost 6 months and it still works and have never had one problem with it ever pretty amazing if you ask me. The 3.2 MP sensor in the P8 in my mind is enough for just about anybody and is of very good quality. The DSC P8 takes awesome direct sunlight pictures as I have taken many in Iraq and have never had a problem with it. Under low light conditions either indoors or outdoors the flash is more than sufficient. This camera has an AF (auto focus) illuminator which briefly shines a reddish light at the subject so the camera can focus properly under low light and no light conditions and from my experience works very, very well. The 3x zoom is no where near how much you would want in a camera but that seems to be the standard these days so we have to live with it. The included Lithium-Ion battery lasts about 120 minutes on a good day which isn't terribly long and I would suggest picking up another battery if you plan using for long periods of time. This camera also comes with a very nice feature in it's MPEGMOVIE VX. It allows you to use this camera as if it were a tiny camcorder but the sad thing is that it fills a 128 MB Memory Stick in a shade over 5 minutes. But this will change when Sony will finally get off their high horse and make some higher capacity Memory Sticks and thus us Memory Stick consumers would be able to have the luxuries that is seen with other memory brands such as SanDisk. This is happening ATTM but prices are outrageous. As for the LCD screen on the back of the camera is by far one of the best I have seen deal with readability under direct sunlight and in my mind is one of the best LCD screens on the market. The buttons are logically placed and the menu is easy to navigate. I guess I really can only say a couple bad things about this camera but they are very mute points in the overall quality of this camera. One misfortune is the included 16 MB Memory Stick and I will say right now you will want to upgrade it before you walk out of the store to at least 128 MB which I think runs for under $50. The only other thing is that when pictures are taken around a fluorescent light in the "point and shoot" mode the color balance seems to be off a touch but thats nothing to lose your lunch over. You can remedy this by using either the Scan mode and the different ambient light settings that it can correct for.  I will tell you the Sony DSC P8 is a great "point and shoot" camera and if you get the itch it has some features that will keep you interested for awhile and ultimately you will buy an upgrade. This camera could easily make you fall in love with the ease of digital photography so in that point it does everything that is asked of it and even in some cases, more.
