            Back when we were car shopping, we almost bought a Mazda Protege.  Instead we went with another Honda Civic (see the reviews).  However, on our last vacation, we rented a Mazda Protege sedan and spent 10 days and 1800 miles seeing the sights of Nova Scotia in it.

The model we drove was pretty plain compared to our Honda Civic.  It didn't have power locks or windows, and had no cruise control (talk about a bummer for a 1800 miles loop).  It handled well on the fertile flat farmland of Prince Edward Island and in the coast twists and turns between Halifax and Peggy's Cove.  And the engine didn't let me down in the mountainous Cape Breton Highlands either.  Despite the way it handled, it still had a 'cheap feel' to it, not that a Civic is a Lexus either.  The Civic just seems more solid, less tin-can-ish.

There was ample storage in the cab for various touristy stuff we got.  Driver and passenger doors had plenty of space for brochures, books, or CDs.  The glove box had room for CDs and a 12v(DC) to 110v(AC) converter we'd brought along.  And between the seats up near the dash was room for yet more CDs, or in our case, a AA battery recharger  with 12v adapter (for our Nikon Coolpix800 camera, see review).

Since we camped, we got used to a trunk that seemed smaller than the Civic.  All our camping gear fit into two large army-issue duffle bags, but those had to go into the back seat, as the trunk held our two suitcases (good thing Continental Airlines lost our other suitcase, otherwise we would have had to put that in the cab of the car as well *roll_eyes_here*).

I personally liked the fact it had a CD player that sounded ok.

Would I rent one again?  Yes, but I'd probably see if I could get a different make/model so that I can recoup some of that car rental money with another epinions review.
