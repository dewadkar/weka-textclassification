            After researching and trying to figure out what kind of new car we wanted, we decided to go with the 2000 Honda Accord.  There were several reasons we like this car!

1).  We have a 96 Honda Civic and have been impressed with its performance as well as how it has held up living in the city.  We knew that we couldn't go wrong with another Honda

2).  The Accord has a wonderful track record.  The only bad thing we heard was that the engine was noisy.  It is a little but it isn't something that bothers or affects us.

3).  For the money and for how long we knew it would last us, it was a deal.  The Camry was rated about equal with the Honda but we felt more comfortable with the Accord's history and I liked the look of it better.

Features include in the model we have(EX):

-Moonroof
-AC(much needed in CA)
-anti-lock brakes
-Cassette Tape Stereo
-A very roomy back seat and front seat too
-Great gas mileage even in the city.  We get 20-30 miles to a gallon  depending on what kind of driving we are doing.

We paid for the extra feature of an anti-lock system.  If I push a button on my key chain, locks the car and makes it so the car cannot be started(with a key or with jimmied with something else) unless it is unlocked with the same remote. If someone tries to get in, an alarm goes off. It is a nice feature to have for the city! It is a sturdy car which we are very impressed with and feel confident in the protection that it offers on the road.  With a new baby on the way, that is important to us!! :)  We chose the black color(with little blue sparkles in it) which doesn't look as much like a &quot;family car&quot; to us!  We still feel sporty in it! :)
