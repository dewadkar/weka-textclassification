            I've been driving a '94 Honda Accord LX Coupe for a while now, and love it! There's nothing to hate about this car. The engine runs smooth, the gas mileage is great (34 mpg on the automatic model) and the spacious interior provides a very quiet ride. Steering is smooth, braking is excellent, and the driver and passenger air bags provide the security that makes this a top choice for a family car. The trunk gives plenty of room for luggage, and visibility is great for the driver, very few blind spots. I took a 20-hour drive in it and was comfortable the whole way. My wife instantly fell in love with the car, and loves to drive it, too.
