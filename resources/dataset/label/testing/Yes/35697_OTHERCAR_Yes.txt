            I have bought one of these within the past 3 months and i and very happy with it . The slower center of gravity on the stock ones are great . The suv handles like a car in it own way and can still show class when driving down the road . We have more room then a car and still the 4x4 avalibility . The resale is very high and with a 141000 miles on it , it is still worth $7000 in the kelly blue book . This suv i highly recommend !!!  The 92 we have has very little rust and is not babed , by me anyways . The only thing i have noticed is that most of them have problems with the front end going bad , tie rods and idler arm , and this is the only thing i have had wrong on this one also . I not really in to chevy's but the more i drive this one i seem to like them more and more each day . I have test drove a ford explorer and the ride was like a lumber truck and i was much higher also ( center of gravity ) . the four doors make it much easier for adults to get in and one of and the tintes glass ( stock ) seems to save the inteior much better. I would tell my mom to get one of these ....<br><br>
