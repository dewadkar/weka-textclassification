            I bought my 93 Nissan with 58,000 miles.  It now has 145,000 miles on it.  I have a 5 speed, XE four dour version.  The only thing I have had trouble with is the fuel pump.  If anyone ever needs to replace theirs, get at it from under the rear seat.  There is an opening to the gas tank there and the fuel pump is mounted right there.
The car is still going strong mechanically.  The clear coat is starting to come off now though.  
I purchased the car for 9500 dollars in 1996 with the 58,000 miles.  
I would recommend that if someone is shopping for Nissan Altima's, avoid the XE version.  It is the bare bones version as opposed to the GXE or the GLE.  
For a passenger car, there is plenty of leg room in the back for adults.  The trunk is also roomy.
The one con I mentioned above is fogginess.  The car fogs up in the winter months for some reason.  I've found that Rain-X anti-fog takes good care of this problem.
I would recommend the Altima as a long term car whereas it can be bought, paid for, and then there is still more life to the car.
