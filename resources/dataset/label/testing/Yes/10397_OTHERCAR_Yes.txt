            I have been a Ford guy my whole life, but when the time arose to buy a new truck, I went with a Chevy. Why you ask ? I went to my friends Ford dealership - Asked him to sell me a new 2002 Ford Pickup, with only one stipulation...NO Diesel. He said "Nope.. wont do that to you" Why ??... Ford doesn't have a Mid-Power level engine. Their 5.4 is an Underpowered Mustang engine...their V-10 has a Harmonic Dampener on the Pass side camshaft???? (whats that about) and gets 8 miles to the gallon ???... So I went and test drove the 2500HD with a 300 horse 6.0 liter. Now this engine has some power. How can Chevy still produce a push rod engine with great power and still pass emission certification?? Ford can't seem to figure it out?? So far..the Truck has been fantastic...
EXTERIOR
The Indigo Blue paint is applied very well. I have waxed the truck a few times now....and have only noticed one imperfection. This is really good for a truck. The body panels line up great and the buldging hood of the HD looks fantastic. The aluminum rims add a classy touch to a work truck. 
INTERIOR
My truck was purchased with the LS Trim package - The 40/20/40 split buckets are very comfortable. The seat belt restaints are a little tight for my 6'3" frame - My shoulders are higher then the rear output of the retractor - but are better then previous years (99). The ergonomics of the interior is fantastic. All the controls are easy to reach and well thought out. The factory Radio/CD player works well and has a nice sound to it. More bass than I thought it would have for a factory radio. The auto lights are a nice touch and the fold down middle console holds lots of stuff. One problem that I found is the seat adjusters under the seats make it impossible to store my trailer hitch underneath. The adjusters block most of the room under the seat and in a Non-Extra cab - you need all the room you can get. This is actually quite more annoying than you might think. There is a lot of room to be had under seats...but not with the LS Split bucket option.  
MECHANICAL
The 6.0 liter Engine was the # 1 reason behind the purchase and has yet to fail. Great power, I have yet to tow my Drag Car (Ford Mustang) - racing season is right around the corner - but I have hauled some wood and the 6.0 handled it pretty well. The tried and true 4 sp transmission shifts firm in Tow-Haul mode and the Tranny Temp gauge is a great addition - All Trucks should come with this option. The large front and rear Disc Brakes seem to work well - but haven't been fully tested yet. I should be able to write a more complete review after the racing season. 
OVERVIEW
The 2002 Chevy has been up to all the tasks I have put it up to....the real test will be this summer's drag racing season. If you are looking for a do it all truck - then the Chevy is the right purchase.

**** Update****

The 2002 racing season is over and the Chevy did not miss a beat. The 6.0 had plenty of power for the long hills in upstate NY and the brakes never let me down. I did have one problem so far....the upper speaker in the driver side door fell out. The plastic mounting tabs broke right off...and was hanging by the wire. The local GMC dealer fixed it - no questions. I average 12 MPG towing and 14 empty - Not too bad by way off the pace of my buddies Duramax - 20 towing. 
Overall I really like the truck.
