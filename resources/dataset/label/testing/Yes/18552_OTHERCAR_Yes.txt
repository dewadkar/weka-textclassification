            I got my 1992 Cutlass Ciera from my grandmother in November 1999 because she decided to quit driving for health reasons.  I had driven it before, and I was very happy to become the car's owner, as well as receiving my first car.

I am continually impressed on how reliable this car is.  The only problem that comes to mind is time I had to replace the rear left turn signal bulb.  That is the closest thing I've ever had to a break down.  The car is very roomy, even for my 6'1&quot; 200lb body.  The instrument panel has a very clean design, and the heating and radio are very intuitive to use.  The car has a very smooth, quiet ride.  The 3.3L v6 is a very nice engine.  This car is very safe as well.  In early april 2000, another car made a right hand turn into my car.  Although there was $2,363.31 US worth of damage to the car, neither myself nor my passenger was hurt.  

However, this car is never going to win a beauty contest.  The styling, both inside and out, is very boxy and boring.  And the v6 is not as fuel efficient as a 4-cylinder.  But all of the car's benefits more than outweigh these two drawbacks.

In conclusion, I have to say that the Cutlass Ciera makes an excellent first car, and an excellent used car.<br><br>
