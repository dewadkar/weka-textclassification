            My local dealer had a &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; type of ad for this car, and I would not let them switch.  I got it brand new for $13,400...Try doing that with your Camry.

It has lots of headroom, which is important for a tall guy like me.  My wife is 5'2&quot; and has a bit of trouble seeing out the back.  However, it seems like rear seats in ALL cars have gotten taller lately to incorporate rear head restraints and deeper trunks.  We drive our cars for many, many years, so the evolution of design tends to be drastic between our purchases. 

The car is quiet and reliable.  We have had no trips back to the dealer in 12,000 miles.  The four cylinder engine is peppy, but a little raucous on hard acceleration. . .but that does not bother me too much.  The 2.4 litre engine is derived from the GM Quad-4 which was not the best.  Being de-tuned a bit from the Quad-4, this engine should probably last OK though.  I'll let you know how it held up in another 148,000 miles. 

Handling is crisp. . . maybe a little too crisp.  The steering is fast and a bit twitchy on winding roads.  Freeway cruising is stable, and the ride is comfortable.  There are lots of nice touches in the design of the interior. . .very ergonomic and roomy.

Altogether the car is great for the price.  It's not as refined as the upscale imports, but then again, neither am I.  Overall, I recommend this car.<br><br>
