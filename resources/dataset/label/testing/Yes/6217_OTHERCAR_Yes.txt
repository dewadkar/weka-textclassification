            Why did I buy this vehicle?

The price was right (24K loaded) and it's functionality can't be beat. I don't work in construction, so I don't need a full size pickup bed. (But my dog, Xylo loves it!) Plus, it just looks so damn cool!

I love this truck. Granted it only has 140 miles on it (we'll see how the trip to Baja goes). I migrated from a 1991 Saab 900s to this truck, and haven't looked back yet. The interior is comfortable (caveat: I am 5'7&quot;) the dash layout is simple and clean, and the ride is smooth. Some say it needs more power, but the 170 horsies are fine by me. The CD stereo tapedeck is nice and loud. The night lights on the dash are a sweet ice blue, and cup holders are perfectly located. The ONLY complaints that I have is that the overdrive button on the automatic transmission is defaulted to the ON position, and that the removable wind &quot;foil&quot; on the roof rack blocks the sunroof. 

Driving this truck is kinda like driving a SUV-Pickup hybrid (well, duh, that's what it is!) It feels heavy, but solid, and is pretty quiet. The ride height is nice, (you can see eye to eye with all those soccer moms in their gawd awful beheamouth SUVS that never see a dirt road) visibility is clear and it feels as though a 1800 mile trek might not be that big of a deal. (I'll report back after the Tahoe to Baja adventure). The power is decent and should suffice for any reasonable adventure. The automatic transmission shifts smooth.

Active people should love this car. Soccer moms and posuer 4x4'ers need not apply.<br><br>
