            I never really cared for SUV's because they felt like trucks and when you're used to compact cars, it is difficult to adjust to the height as well as the handling of one of them trucks. However, my husband bought me a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder and I can't tell you how well it handles and how comfortable I feel driving it. I'm not a fanatical endorser of products, but I must say that I have never felt more in control than when I am in my Pathfinder. There is plenty of room inside and is pretty deceiving from the outside, but I can handle the corners and quick U-Turns effortlessly. I must admit that I did have to adjust to the vehicle's strength and horsepower, but all in all, it was a quick and easy adjustment. I couldn't see going anywhere without my Pathfinder.

I would recommend one used or new to anyone.
