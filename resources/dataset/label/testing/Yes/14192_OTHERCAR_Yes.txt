            Not many "new" car lines can boast the lineage that the brand new Mitsubishi 2002 Lancer can...  The US Lancer is derived from the Japanese Lancer Evolution line that has existed since the early 1990s (maybe earlier than that, but I'm not totally sure) which came to its peak in the last couple of years with the King of Rally Cars... the Lancer Evolution VI.  The Lancer Evolution line is a superbly engineered vehicle... I have a Tommi Maiken Lancer Evolution VI that been modified.  These cars can truly perform...

so what is the deal with the new Mitsubishi Lancer line?

Well, the Lancer Evolution is now up to model VII and Mitsubishi has learned quite a great deal in producing this line that has gone into making the value line consumer end Lancer in the US.  Does the US Lancer show any of its pedigree from Rally Car royalty?

<b>From Evolution to Devolution?</b>

<i>Exterior</i>
I picked a thunder gray metallic exterior with grey sport fabric interior.  The seats are fairly comfortable with a good amount of leg room and head room... at least for me!  The exterior has a subtle agressive look to it although it does not look as agressive as the Lancer Evolution VI.  The car has clean lines and a sturdy solid feel to it as well.  I assume that the Lancer Evolution VII line looks more similar to the US Lancer than the Evolution VI.  The car's overall shape whispers you to drive it at high speed on clear open roads.  My Evolution VI exterior design demands that you plow it at high speeds over open road.

Overall, the exterior look is pleasing and a tad bit alluring.

<i>Interior</i>
The cloth is nice and supple.  It has a comfortable feel overall.  Everything is in fairly easy reach and the dashboard is easy to read.  Some people may find the dashboard a bit plain however.  There is ample legroom and headroom... even the back passenger seats have a good view of the road since those seats have been slightly raised from those in front.  Trunk space is decent at 11.3 cubic feet of space but the LS model has 60/40 split fold down seats if you have bigger items.

The LS also has an improved speaker system from Mitsubishi that sounds fairly good... although not nearly as good as the stock system in a Lexus (what were you expecting for a car less than $16 grand for the whole car?).

The LS version has 15 inch wheels instead of the standard 14 inch.  The car is a inline-4 2.0 liter 16-valve engine with a 13.2 gallon gas tank.  Mitsubishi claims that the engine has been designed for maximum low-end and mid-range torque... and when you drive the car, you defintely get a hint of that.  Automatic transmission gets an average of 27 mpg in the city and 39 mpg on the highway.  Manual transmission people squeeze out a bit more savings with 29/41 mpg.  Another nice feature is the compliance of the engine with ULEV standards (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle).  The steering is power rack-and-pinion, which is very nice.

The A/C and heat work... I thought it took a while to get started and modify the temperature of the car.  Defogging of the windows took a couple of minutes as well.  No moonroof on the Lancer either.

Anti-lock brakes and dual front side air bags are options on the Lancer.  So you better open your wallet a little wider when you purchase the Lancer.

<i>Performance</i>
You are still dealing with a inline-4 engine but it does have alot of pep.  You are not going to break any speed records with this car, but I was impressed with the ease of handling and the good low-end power on the Lancer.  The Lancer can summon some good power when passing.  Steering is tight and responsive.  The suspension is pretty good and absorbant.  Wind noise is present but not overly annoying.  No glaring weaknesses on visibility.  For the value of this car, I can't find too many complaints with this value sport sedan.

<b>Overall</b>

I think the Lancer is a great car for the money.  $16 grand gets you alot of car with only small sacrifices on power and performance.  I loved the handling of the Lancer, it is very responsive and lively.  I may be a bit biased towards the Lancer due to Lancer Evolution VI... a car that I truly love to drive.  The only question that will come up is the reliability of the Lancer... it's still technically a new car line although its roots are based on the Lancer Evolution line.  The Lancer Evolution was a rather reliable car, so I don't foresee any major problems in the Lancer production line itself.

Go and test drive one for yourself.  It will definitely give you something to think about... if not outright buy!

P.S.- Why did I buy a Lancer?

  It's always nice to have a car that you're willing to drive anywhere and have a little fun while driving it!
