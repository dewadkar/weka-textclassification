            THE 1998 CAMARO Z28 
This the finest car in this model Chevrolet has ever made!

The performance from the LS1 aluminum small block 5.7 liter engine is outstanding.
Equipped with the 6 speed manual transmission ,miles per gallon are in the economy area...17 city 24 on the highway.
The only bad thing that can be said about this car is there virtually no back seat... unless you are ten years old !
The most awesome performance for the price is the main reason to buy this car.
Many dyno tests done on this engine have stated the horse power at 330 ,but General Motors has stated it at 305.
To  DRIVE THIS CAR IS LIKE RIDING IN DREAM....SMOOTH AND &quot;WAITING&quot;....PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN AND THE &quot;WAIT IS OVER&quot;.....IT IS A SCREAMER!!!!!!!
ONLY ONE MORE THING I CAN ADD IT CRUSHES MUSTANGS! <br><br>
