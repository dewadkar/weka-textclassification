            I've had a 1998 Saab 900S for about 18 months now.  It's my second Saab (the first, a 1989 9000S toasted its transmission at that point and I opted to replace rather than rebuild).  For the most part, I LOVE THIS CAR!!!  It's smooth to drive, has good acceleration and I love the windshield wipers -- on the windshield, the back window (which was really the only thing I wanted to change on my 9000) and on the headlights.  The seat heat is mega-welcome on days like today (-17F with wind chill).  I expect this one to last me for another ten years or so.  And the automatic roadside assistance is really a godsend -- they're much better than AAA for responsiveness (at least in my experience).

What don't I love about it?  Two things:  I'm on my third radio antenna -- it keeps bending (often for no apparent reason) and then refuses to retract fully (HEY SAAB ARE YOU LISTENING???) - the mechanics tell me &quot;this happens&quot; with this car.  The second one is pretty petty.  I WANT A CUPHOLDER FOR THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER!!  There's one between the seats (which isn't exactly easy to reach and get to and which does NOT hold the 32oz cups I tend to favor) but the only one for the passenger is in the glove compartment and it's more like a depression for the cup rather than a true holder so if you have to stop quickly welcome to a wet glove box -- yuck! 

What would I change? I'd also like a little more backseat legroom -- but that's because I drive with the seat all the way back so it's hard to put someone behind me and still have me have enough room to drive (then again, I typically have the seat 6&quot;-8&quot; further back than any of my friends, if that gives you any idea).  And I'd let the antenna retract if you switch to CD.

Bottom line, if I were buying one for my own kid would I buy one of these?  YES.  Unequivocally.  This is a good, sturdy car with a lot of life and is VERY comfortable to drive, even on long trips (it's had a couple of 14 hour trips loaded to the gills and has acquitted itself very nicely).<br><br>
