            First I have to state that I love my ZX2, that said, this is why. First of all, I needed a newer car when I went to purchase this vehicle as I currently have two older cars; a 1969 Pontiac Catalina and a 1982 Cadillac Sedan DeVille. 

This was not the vehicle I went looking for, I actually intended to look at the new Ford Focus. While waiting to be helped I checked out the used car lot at the local Ford dealership and was attracted to a few cars, but this came to be the only car that really fit most of my qualifications. I was looking for an American built car with an automatic, tape deck, 4 door car that I could fit in. You see at 6'6&quot; I don't fit in a lot of smaller cars, but I got in the car, took a test drive and aside from a rougher ride than I'm used to, I was quite impressed. So I left the dealership 11 grand poorer than I went in.

Some of the things I love about this car are that it will easily spin the tires from a stop, it accelerates well and is cheap to insure. The stereo sounds pretty good and is easy to reach without taking my eyes off the road. My ZX2 goes anywhere I point it and is almost like a go-cart. Small, quick, agile and great braking capability. I also love the trunk, I never expected this small of a car to have such a cavernous trunk.

Some things I don't like are the small cup holders, 60-80 MPH passing acceleration, the fact that I can't turn the fog lights on without turning on the headlights and that there is no option on the climate control to just run the fan with no heat or cooling. There are some rattles, and you have to be careful to roll the windows up all the way or you'll get excessive wind noise and vibration from the doors. Of all the people that I've had rise in the car, not one has managed to roll the window all the way up.

I'm also unhappy with the fuel economy. It's rated at 28 city and 38 highway, but I have never seen more than 25 city and 30 highway. The huge V8 in my old Pontiac can almost do that. I make at least 1 interstate trip a month so mileage is important to me.


I live at home with my mother and she has a 98 Escort SE Sport that she bought new and I have driven it off and on since she bought it. That was what made me even look at new Fords. Though I ended up buying a used one, the car has lower mileage than the NADA states is typical and if it were built one month later, it would be a 99.

I'm a mechanic and have yet to have to do any repairs on it, though I will need to do both a tune up and oil change soon. I have had it for about 2 months and have already put well more than 2000 miles on it. It is a lot of fun to drive both in the city and on the highway. I don't typically keep my cars for more than about 6 months and by two months I'm usually already looking for a replacement. Not so here, I plan to keep this car until the wheels fall off.

The front seating area is quite comfortable, and when at work when on my brake, I can usually be found in my Z laying back, cranking the tunes. It is comfortable enough that I have fallen asleep a couple of times. Also about the rear seat space; I've never had anybody back there and probably never will. It looks tiny back there, I use it as storage space.

This is my fourth Escort, I've had an 85 Hatchback, an 87 Wagon and an 87 GT. In my family there are currently two 85 Escorts and two 98s.

I intend to autocross this little car next summer and will spend the winter upgrading it for such.
