            Had my 4Runner for 3 years now.
I originally purchased the vehicle because of my need for a vehicle that could haul stuff, while at the same time drive like a car. This is exactly  how the vehicle performs. It has enough power to get out of any situation, and it can certainly take a hit. I was rear ended by a truck that was going about 40 mph. I was fine, while the rear of the truck took the brunt of the hit. Repair was $6000 for replacement of rear door and bumper.
The low point of the vehicle is the cup holders, which disrupt view and operation of the climate control system. Also the standard stereo system is very mediocre( I have the 3 in 1 stereo,cd &amp; tape)
At high speeds, the noise level is higher than a luxury car, but this is not noticeable at city speeds.

This vehicle is really suited for anyone looking for a slightly larger vehicle with more room. I find the vehicle comfortable to sit in, in both the front &amp; back seats.The height of the vehicle gives you vision over most other vehicles, which is a plus.

Lastly, a large consideration was the way this vehicle retains its value when it comes time to sell, better than most cars on the road.<br><br>
