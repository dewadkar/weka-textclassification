            The Mitsubishi 3000 GT (known as the GTO in Japan) is for one who likes a full package.  Looks, Power, and 4 wheel drive!  However, these are only available for the VR-4 model.  The lower end models are in a completely different class!  Even if looks resemble the mighty VR-4, performance and packaging differ a whole lot.  The VR-4 packs an impressive 320 hp engine using a 6 speed manual transmission from a V6 twin turbo engine.  For those looking for fun, here's your piece of equipment.  I personally would recommend this car if you don't mind paying a hefty sum on a Japanese car.  For the price of this, one could easily purchase a Porche Boxter or a BMW.  However, I must say the handling is quite impressive with the torque transfer 4 wheel drive system and the pickup from the mighty engine of he VR-4 is very fast yet controlled.  Although I must say the exterior is a design I like, Mitsubishi has failed to re-invent the interior over the years.<br><br>
