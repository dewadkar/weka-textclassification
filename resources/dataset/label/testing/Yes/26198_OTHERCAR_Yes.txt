            I'm working up to 1,000 miles on my 2001.5 Passat GLS, and I'm still falling in love with this car every day.
For those of you who are shopping and are considering Toyotas and Hondas, this could be helpful. Last year, I bought a new 2000 Passat. There was a problem, and I ended up taking it back and getting a 2000 Honda Accord V6. And though it was a great car, every time I saw a new Passat on the road, I regretted my decision. Finally, I broke down and bought the 2001.5. I've never been so happy with a car.
I chose blue silver metallic, a stunning color that isn't easy to find. From the walk-up, the car looks much more expensive than it is. With the addition of the luxury package, Tiptronic 5-speed automatic, HomeLink and the Monsoon audio system, I had the 1.8 Turbo out the door for $23,995 plus tax.
Friends assume the car cost $30,000+ because it looks every bit like a full luxury ride, more like an Audi or Beemer than previous-generation VWs.
Its driving manners are superb, quite reminiscent of a BMW 5 series. A bit of body lean because the suspension is tuned for comfort, but a rock-solid feel from the controls to the wheels. It starts when you close the doors to a satisfying and solid "thunk" that tells you the car is built like a tank. The 2001.5 is 10 percent more rigid than the 2001, and it shows in even tighter tolerances than the already excellent 2001.
The engine is a winner. Mated to a Porsche Tiptronic 5-speed, which can be driven in fully automatic or manual-shift modes, the little 1.8 Turbo takes a second to get going. At about 3,000 RPM and up, the turbo kicks in to satisfyingly pin you back in the seat, all the while the suspension absorbs bumps and ripples in the road and renders them barely perceptible. This is a car that should be taken out on a curvy country road and driven just for sheer joy. It's that fun.
The Monsoon audio system, to which I added a Panasonic CD changer for $300 (VW dealers want $500 or more for the same changer with a VW badge), is simply the best factory audio I've heard. With its 200-watt amp and eight speakers, including four crisp tweeters placed strategically for the front and rear seats, it offers great detail, imaging and raw power. The soft-clipping amp keeps you from blowing things up if you get carried away with the volume.
Spend the $325 for the Monsoon. You CANNOT build an aftermarket system for that kind of money that will sound as good, and you save yourself the trauma of seeing sound-shop installers pulling your car apart to put in that aftermarket amp and speakers. (Monsoon is factory-installed.)
Volkswagens have earned a reputation for electrical problems. That may be the case with this car. And you know what? I don't really care. I chose it ultimately over my 2000 Accord V6 and other cars in the class because it delivered by far the best seat-of-the-pants driving feel and looks. If the electrics should ever have problems, they probably won't be terribly expensive to fix. The real concern is the drivetrain, and that's covered by a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty. All other parts are covered by a 2-year/24,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty, and rust is guaranteed not to eat through for 12 years. Additionally, VW gives you, at no charge, two years of free scheduled maintenance and comprehensive roadside assistance. It's no wonder I'm not worried.
The bottom line: If you are a car enthusiast, don't you dare buy a Japanese or American brand until you drive the new Passat. It is the absolute class of its class, from its factory-standard alarm and anti-theft systems to its six airbags, including a side curtain to protect the head that contains the brain that was smart enough to choose this car.
You'll be a happy driver, you'll get envious looks and you can be content with knowing you got it at a bargain price.
