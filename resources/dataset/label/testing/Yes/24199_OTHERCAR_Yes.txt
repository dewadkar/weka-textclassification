            This was probably the best $450 I've spent in my life.  The camera was only $300 plus tax, but the extra expenses made the camera worth while.

This camera has all the advantages of a digital camera:  not waiting to see how the pictures develop, an LCD to see how they look on the spot, etc.

The camera has very good picture quality, as seen on my website:  the background is of an IC I took using the macro focus (which works very well as well).  Notice how clear this picture is (it's dark because I darkened it to make it a background)?  This was done using the autofocus!

Upgrades:  I upgraded to a 32MB memory card and I have never maxxed it out, even with a few minutes of movie!  I bought a polarized lens, which has worked pretty well so far.  I also bought the battery charger, because this thing walks AA batteries!  Two AA's are good for about four pictures, so I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase the charger/rechargeable batteries (it's also an AC adaptor!).

The only problems I've had were with the batteries dying really fast, a bad instruction manual (the first time I tried to download pictures from the camera, I didn't realize it was just viewed as another hard drive, and there was no mention of it anywhere in the manual on on Sony's site!), and it's poor low-light abilities.  The low light basically works on the concept that the shutter must be held open longer.  In low-light, it has to be held open forever, and it's almost guaranteed that you or the object you are photographing will move and blur the shot.  But that's to be expected, so I can't complain too much.

All in all, this is a great camera for a college student (like me!) or someone who wants a digital camera to play with.
