            The ultimate people mover.  This vehicle seats 8 or 6 in comfort.  It can fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the back with the seat down.  It can tow 5000 lbs.  And it can do 0-60 in 8 seconds.  I have been in many long (6 hours to 24 hours) in this car.  It is very comfortable with lots of room for stuff even without the roof-rack or a trailer.  It handles much better than a minivan and virtually ignores snow.  Because it was built to tow, with no load behind it it accelerates in a way that no station wagon should.  Because of this excess of power the engine is very rarely strained and thus will last a long time.  The AC works well and the stereo is decent.  It is very aerodynamic so wind noise at freeway speeds is limited.  A side affect of the aerodynamics is that is gets about 26 mpg on the highway with no trailer and the AC off.  With a 5.0L V-8!  With a 22 gallon tank that works out to about a 500 mile useful range (running a tank dry is never a good idea).

Engine:

GM 305 (5.0L) fuel injected V-8.  This engine is quiet, smooth, and powerful.  We have pulled a trailer weighing around 3500 lbs that is square with a large front surface area without too much trouble.  It did require turning off the overdrive (overdrive rpm@60mph=1500, 3rd gear=2000).  At about 135,000 miles one of the rings froze causing a reduction in power.  We were unable to break it free despite many efforts.  This hasn't had a lot of effect on the car, although towing capacity and acceleration with the A/C on have been reduced noticeably.  This problem is probably due to rapid mileage accumulation (about 60-70 miles a day), hard driving conditions and towing.  It has broken down only once due to a bad alternator but I would be cautious about buying one with a lot of miles on it.

Handling:

Handles very impressively... for a 20 foot station wagon.  Better than an SUV or mini-van because it is lower to the ground and wider I still wouldn't try road-racing (although my dad did once chase down a guy in a civic after a hit and run...).  Bad weather handling is where it really excels.  Large weight, good tires, and an ok ABS system help there.  Rear-wheel drive can take a while to get used to in the snow though, so this probably isn't the best winter vehicle for everyone.

Interior:

The seats are wonderful.  I have ridden in this car for over 24 hours with breaks only for food and other necessities.  My back didn't hurt (although my legs were a little cramped, I am 6 foot).  There is a huge amount of room for cargo, even with 6 people (3 in each front bench seat).  Fold up the rear-facing back seat and there are 8 seatbelts, although not much room for gear.  The compass in the rear-view mirror is a nice touch.

Exterior:

The aerodynamics are obvious from the look of the vehicle, although the streamlined style was short lived.  The roof rack is ok, but not the best design.  Without cargo on it the moveable cross bar serves as a (non-obtrusive) spoiler improving highway mileage and ride.  The rear gate is two pieces, a glass window that lifts straight up and a lower door that folds down like a tailgate AND can open up to the side like a door.  With the rear seat folded down there is a lockable boot large enough to keep a lot cargo hidden.  We keep anything of value here as it is a non-obvious and lockable compartment.  There is also a side compartment next to the rear seat and a compartment large enough for a full size spare.
