            I purchased a 1999 GS 300 in May of 1999.  I loved the look of the car and test drove one in January.  When I drive the car, I feel good in it. Not only is it extremely comfortable (I love the leather) it is a fun car to drive and I have had many looks from people as well as comments on its elegant yet sporty style.

The car really is a beautiful machine.  I opted for the 17&quot; rims and tires which make the car handle unlike any car I have ever driven. Don't tell, but I negotiated with the dealer to include the 17's and the gold for free! I chose the Spectrum Blue Mica color, and I have only seen one other one in my area, which makes it all the more attractive.

Driving this car makes my long commute bearable. Cornering is tight and accurate. Acceleration is breath-taking for a V6.

The only drawback is the price, especially if you get it loaded.  All in all, I am very glad I bought it. It is certainly a pleasure to own and drive.<br><br>
