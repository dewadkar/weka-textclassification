            I just bought a 2004 XC-90 with the five cylinder engine and AWD. This is the best SUV I've owned (and I used to have a 1999 Toyota Landcruiser which comes in second).  The XC-90 is ROCK SOLID.  The seats are so comfortable, the car is well engineered, the engine is very responsive.  I drive with a light foot on the throttle because I want reasonable gas consumption.  Right now I'm averaging 18-19 in the city and 21-22 on the highway.  The five speed automatic is a great transmission, and when you really need the passing speed, the transmission kicks down and the turbo kicks in.  Driving the transmission in manual mode is lots of fun, but I'm sure that I pay for that in gas consumption.

The rearmost seats are very cleverly engineered.  I love the fold down mechanism for the middle seats, and last weekend when I went to the lumber yard, I really appreciated that the front passenger seat folds flat and I was able to fit 10' board inside the car with no effort.  The rear tailgate arrangement is really slick.

The only problems I've had after three weeks is that for some unknown reason, the radio shuts off within two minutes of starting the car and then turns back on.  They upgraded the software that runs the car's network, but the problem persists.  Also for some strange reason both trip odometers reset to zero one night on their own.  Both of these are minor annoyances, and I'm sure that they will be fixed at some point.

I can't tell you just how great the seats are. I drive 75 miles a day and the seats are the most comfortable that I've ever ridden in.  Although the interior is very simple (read "plain") everything works as it should and the climate control is great.

I look forward to driving this car, and am sure that Volvo has a winner here.  Although I always thought I wanted to drive truck based SUVs, after the great experience so far with the Volvo XC-90 I'm a changed man.

Great job Volvo!
