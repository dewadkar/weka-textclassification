            Yes we can all say that SUV's have been popular in the 90's. Well the New 2000 Explorer is quite amazing. The stylish exterior is very hip and trendy, and comes in a lot of different finishes. What's great about this car is the interior. It is nice, roomy, and has a very quiet and serene ride. The leather seats, which are heated and the 6 cd changer make a great addition as well. On the road, it has very good handling, however it still drives like a truck. Another problem about this car is that it is very very tall. This could present a problem with parking in some areas, especially because there are some blind spots in the rear view mirror. I really like this car, but what I have heard is that it only takes 12,000 bucks to make it, however ford sells it for 27? Well, I'll trust my own experiences, the car is very good. <br><br>
