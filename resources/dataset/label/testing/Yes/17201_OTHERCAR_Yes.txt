            Yes, I have named my Honda Civic.  His name is Bert.  Like the Sesame Street character.  I even have a little stuffed Bert buckled into the back seat.

Why do I mention this?  Because this car has been such a great part of my life that I consider it part of my family.

Admittedly, this was my first car, but I have experienced all of my dad's
adventures with his 88' Toyota Camry and 84' Buick Century so I have that to compare it too.

First, it's just a really nice car.  It's sleek, stylish, has a lot of nice features (even for the DX model).  It gets great gas mileage, has
a good amount of pep, and it's never had to go in for any servicing besides the standard, and I have placed 50,000 miles on it already.

The things I am truly impressed by are:
- The stereo is really high up on the dashboard, making it easy to change radio channels without having to look away from the road.
- The optional tape deck is down out of view, behind the pop up drink rack cover.  This adds additional security, it can also make juggling drinks and tapes difficult.
- The factory radio/tuner runs my tape deck but also an optional cd changer in my trunk, so it's expandable without having to replace it.
- The seat fabric has been really durable and comfortable
- The adjustable height front seat belts are convenient for various height passengers
- It's really easy to get to most anything under the hood.
- It was incredibly easy to change a flat tire never having done it before, everything's there, and it's simple.

Things that are a little worrisome:
- It's hard to change tapes with drinks in the cupholder.
- You have to be careful, the (automatic) gear shift doesn't lock as it
should, so it's possible to bump it from drive to neutral while driving.

All in all, it's a wonderful car.  I spoke so well of it that my mother bought the same car (an LX) and she likes it too.<br><br>
