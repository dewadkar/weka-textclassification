            Wow! What a camera. Easy to use. Inexpensive to operate (it uses 3.5&quot; Floppy Disks to record its images). It feels good in your hand.  Sleek and slim with a professional feel.  Yet, easy to operate.  The manuals are helpful and guide you through the whole process of learning how to use a digital camera.  The pictures are detailed and sharp.  I especially like the feature where I can view my images on my TV.  Everything you need, except for a carrying case is included, including software to edit your images.  And with a 16x zoom you will not miss the long shots.  A plus item, not unusual for a Sony product, they have a really good one this time.<br><br>
