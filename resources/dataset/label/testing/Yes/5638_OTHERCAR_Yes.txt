            I was looking to replace a 1988 Dodge Caravan as a new job had me commuting 60 miles a day.  Nothing out there really grabbed me until I saw one of these beasties on the road.

I like the higher driving position, I'm just under 6 ft 220# with bad knees, I'm not levering myself in & out of this as I am with most of the smaller sedans.  The view is not as good as the old van, but much better than most of the other vehicles I looked at. It feels like you're sitting about 4-6 inches higher than the car in front of you.

I bought a white base, auto, in dash 6 CD, power package, cargo nets, seat back pockets, cargo tray, & bumper protector.  It was on the lot this way & I didn't find any of it objectionable.  I'm getting 30 mpg on the first two tanks of daily commuting (freeway mostly stop & go). 

I actually like the grey body cladding from a practical point of view.  I camp in some pretty out of the way places and the cladding will take the abuse of dirt/gravel roads better than paint. I plan on driving it til it dies so little appearance dings add up. 

The cargo area is more than adequate, with part or all of the rear seat down it's large enough for as much gear as 2-3 people could need. The 60/40 split works well, and the folding front passenger seat is one of those "why didn't anybody think of his before?" moments of genius.

The cabin has so many little storage pockets and compartments I'm in danger of losing things.  I may have to make a map.

All in all, I bought this as an appliance, something to get me to work each day with room for weekend trips.  It meets my needs very closely without making me suffer.  I'm not keen on being boy racer so the GT seemed like an easy way to lose my license. Rowing through a 6 (or 5) speed in stop & go traffic would be enough to put me into carpal tunnel disability.  My wife (significantly shorter at 5'4") likes to drive it and feels it to be more fun than her Saturn SL (duh!).   

This is assembled here in the US, about 15 minutes from where I live.  So I'm keeping my money as local as I can, something I can feel a little better about.

I bought mine by using the GM Buypower site to locate the car I wanted _on_ a lot.  I received a great price offer & was able to get it a little lower in person from Gilroy Pontiac (See Greg Uhley, he was great).  Look around a little, every dealer in the SFO area supposedly got a couple of extra black units as an intro deal.  One dealer admitted he'd make a better deal on one of these. 


Update : 4/21/03

I thought I'd give a little long term update --

I've put about 12k miles on the car so far, no problems at all. No rattles, no warranty issues - zip.   I get a rock solid 30mpg in daily stop & go commute.  This had made a difference as gas climbed above $2 a gallon.  I'd probably do a lot better if I didn't drive at 85mph any time I can. The upside is this vehicle just doesn't attract attention from the CHP. 

I've had it out camping for longer trips, it holds plenty of gear and is easy to load.  The cruise control is good, air conditioning is up to handling summer in the CA central valley at freeway speeds.

I'm wishing more and more that I'd gotten a sunroof, personal preference but my wife and I spend a lot of time in this car.
