             My Husband and I bought an 1996 Cavalier and I loved my car. I loved the gas miliage. It was a good little car that we had. But after a awhile  my husband and I were feeling a little cramped . My husband and I are overweight and felt like the car was getting smaller. I had a 2 door coupe . The color on it was teal I love that color for a vehicle. But I hated the interior color it was grey. I like the car on the highway it was great,it took the road conditions like a breeze. You could not ask for a better car. What I disliked about it was getting to small for my family. I have a tall husband and daughter and I am the short one out of the bunch. So with 3 large people in the car it was feeling snug.
People who want to buy this car should,it will make a great first car. Teenagers, grandparents, college grads , single people this is the car for you. But large family should try to find a car that will fit your family.   <br><br>
