            My father purchased a 1987 Dodge Ram 50 pickup brand new with only 21 miles on it.  He drove it until 1992 when he sold it to me.  He had recently purchased a new vehicle, but had not traded the Ram because it was such a good truck.  I was 16 & the car I was driving was having major problems.  He told me that whatever I could sell my car for was what he would take for his truck. Oh, what dads will do for their daughters!! :-)  I sold my car for $500, and purchased myself a truck.  

I drove the truck until 1997.  I had since gotten married and had a stepson.  Traveling in the pickup was getting difficult because of the small size.  Mine was also a five-speed, so that took up even more room in the cab.  We were wanting a car.  By this time, my dad had traded his truck for a car, but was missing having a truck.  He made the suggestion that we trade.  He then got the Ram back.  

He is still driving this truck today.  It has over 250,000 miles on it and it wasn't until recently that he had to do any repair work on it.  It even had the original spark plugs in it until 200,000 miles.  Even then, once my dad changed them, he said they didn't really even need changed then.  

This truck has gone so many places so many times.  It was the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  The only thing that we ever had to do to it was change the oil and put gas in it.
