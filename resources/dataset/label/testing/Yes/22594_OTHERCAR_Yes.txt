            I had a 98 GTI previously and I must say a lot has improved since then. After taking my new '00 Tropic Orange GTI GLX (VR6) home I really didn't want to get out of the car just yet, so I drove around for some other 'errands' that I needed to run. The next few days I found myself jovially giving friends rides to distant parts of town. This went on for several weeks. What I'm trying to say, this car is FUN TO DRIVE, not to mention chock full of nifty creature comforts. The leather interior is very well done. Even the plastic parts are well crafted. The red and blue dashboard lights are very very cool.

As much as I was wowed by this car (and it's intense color, which I still am in love with after 3 months) I wanted to wait until I gave it the real test before I let the jury out- a 1000 mile road trip over 5 days. This really gave me the chance to see this car for all it's worth and/or demerit. This was the first time I was behind the wheel of the car for over an hour. I found the cars ride was comfortable at 80 MPH for extended duration's, but I found mileage to be more acceptable at about 75 MPH. The seats were still comfortable after several hours behind the wheel. Under normal driving conditions I get about 350 miles per tank. In California. that's about $28 per tank (using premium, of course.) While my new car needed quite a cleaning after car-camping for days, it was a pleasure the whole trip and I was impressed by the amount of stuff I could cram into it with 3 people, thanks to the split rear seats.

Some comments:

- This car has a LOT of power for such a light frame. You really get a lot of bang for the buck at about $23K.
- The new 16&quot; wheels and enhanced suspension are a big improvement over the last model GTI. You can really push this car on the turns.
- This car has a tricky shifter- much harder to use than the '98. I find I can't find gears sometimes, sometimes stall, and even grind from time to time, and I've been driving a stick for over 10 years.
- The leather interior is comparable to cars twice it's price. There are lots of nice little gizmos that are designed in a cool, artsy way, however some are not as well conceived as others. For instance, the automatic wipers that detect rainfall don't seem to kick in if you leave them on and restart the car. The controls on the steering column levers are just plain perplexing.
- The trip and mileage computer is not all that useful, regardless of it's many features. My biggest gripe is that the gas mileage meter reads at too short a time interval so your readings are all over the place.
- The fact that a standard car has cruise control is a bit odd, but I'm not really complaining.
- The trunk light is weak, and in a stupid location on the side bulkhead that is generally blocked by whatever payload you are carrying. It makes accessing the CD changer challenging unless you are parked in broad daylight.
- The keyless entry and ignition key is a cool all-in-one design, and the panic button for the alarm is not big and easy to accidentally press like in the '98, however you have to hold down the buttons for an annoyingly long duration to get the trunk to unlock. Plus, the fact that you have to hit the unlock button twice to open the passenger door seems unnecessary process.
- The center arm rest is at an awkward height that took a lot of getting used to shifting while it was down. This probably aggravates the problem with shifting gears.
- The Monsoon package is a great stereo, however I find the CD player is not all that great at playing RCDs.
- Nice computer climate control, however it doesn't tell you the current temperature in the cabin.
- There are plastic snaps on all of the floor mats to keep them in place, however only the front carpet has buttons to clip them onto. This appears to be a oversight.

All in all I really like this car in spite of its idiosyncrasies. I wanted an small car (I live in the city) with exceptional power and handling but at the same time plenty of room and space for carrying stuff. I was looking for an upscale interior and got a lot more. Comfort was a big factor to me as I'm a wide-shouldered 6' male with knee problems. The price was right and I felt even a little guilty that I was getting such plush car.

I would recommend this car to someone only if they were experienced driving a stick.<br><br>
