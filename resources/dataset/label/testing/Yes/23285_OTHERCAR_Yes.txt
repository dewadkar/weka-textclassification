            I just purchased a used 1995 Subaru Legacy Sedan in November with about 43000 miles on it and I could not be happier!  I love my little car!  The best part about it is that I live in MN and we are in the middle of a very cold winter, I park outside all night long, and have yet to have any problems with my Legacy starting up.  Yippee!  I honestly have not had one problem with the car due to cold, and with my other car I constantly had problems.  I don't even plug it in at night! Just park it and leave it.  Other good things about this car include:

1. a nice smooth ride
2. fold down back seats so you can get into the trunk
3. electric windows and locks
4. you can turn the locks to manual if desired
5. child safety locks.

There are many wonderful things about my car.  There are, however, a few things I would change if given the opportunity.  My fiance says there isn't enough leg room (he's 6 feet tall),even when the seat is all the way back.  The drink holder opens and covers the radio controls and the heating controls, which is annoying, but easy to deal with.  The inside sometimes ices up when it is extremely cold out and you have to either wait for it to melt or scrape it manually which is somewhat awkward.  

All in all, I really enjoy my car and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a smaller sedan.
