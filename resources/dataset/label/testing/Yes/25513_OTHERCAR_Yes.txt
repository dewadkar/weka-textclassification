            I am used to having full size trucks with the power to pull and haul heavy loads.  Unfortunately, I needed something with better gas mileage due to my 1 hour commute one way.  I test drove and eventually bought a 1997 Mazda B-4000.  It wasn't until I got home to realize that the majority of the truck was actually a Ford product.  I get about 20-23 miles per gallon and for a 4x4, that is great!  The truck feels and drives quiet on the road, but when the time is needed, I can put my wooden rails on the back and load the truck up with wood.  I have made many trips into the mountain to cut down trees for firewood.  The total mileage on the truck is 55,000 miles, and I haven't had any trouble at all.  When it snows here in Pennsylvania, I need to switch it into four wheel drive with a turn of the switch.  This truck seems to handle better than my 1981 F-250 in the snow.  I would recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for a truck to be a smooth ride on the road, but when the testosterone is needed, it will work for you.
