            I am very happy with my 2000 Honda Odyssey. The versatility of the third-row fold down seat is amazing. I often need to transport large items, including appliances, furniture etc. which I find at garage and home sales (or even garbage-picking), and it is NEVER a question of will it fit! The automatic doors are a little of a pain. The van has to be in Park for the automatic doors to open, and should be in Park when you close them completely. Since I do a lot of dropping-off and picking-up of the kids, I sometimes close the van doors as I pull away from the curb; doing this can "confuse" the door system and set off an annoying, buzzing alarm. KNOW THIS -- Unplug fuse #13 for a few minutes to re-set the automatic door alarm. This is the same remedy the dealers will do if you bring your van in because the automatic door "alarm" is buzzing. P.S. I love the dealer-installed leather interior -- really improves the look of the interior of the Honda.
