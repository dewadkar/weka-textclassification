                 I bought my Nikkon Coolpix 3500 at Youngsan electronics mart in Seoul, South Korea. I haggled them down to 275,000 Korean Won. This is approx 150 British Pounds (Sterling). Therefore approximately 200 U.S. Dollars. As you can see this is well below the estimated price in the U.S.
     Not only can you take different sizes of pictures, but you can also zoom in to 6 times normal magnification. Shutter speed is adjustable, as are the scene types for your picture: e.g. indoors, sunset, landscape, fireworks etc. There is also a small video clip function allowing you to record action for 10 seconds.
     Perhaps the best and most unique feature is the swivelling lens that allows you to see what you are photographing regardless of whether it is in front of the camera or behind it. Therefore you can take pictures and videos of yourself with friends etc. or of what you can see from where you are standing. This eliminates the chance of a thief stealing your camera, and is vital if there is no one else there to take a picture.
     There are different sizes of memory cards available, at different prices. All cameras should come with two C.D's that you can download onto your computer. The first is instructions in different languages and the second is software needed for downloading pictures and editing them.
     The paper instructions in South Korea are in Japanese, which is not helpful. Also the second disk is in Japanese, so to edit pictures you have taken requires some trial and error. The power plug was also Japanese but you can get a converter for South Korean sockets for 500 won, approx 25 pence therefore approx 30 U.S. cents.
     There are many adjustments you can make in the editing mode including red, green and blue filters. Creating panoramics, i.e. cutting and pasting 180 or 360 degree shots together is also quite easy.
     You can attach downloaded pictures and videos to emails in the normal way, or print them; and even take them to a print shop if you want them on photographic paper.
