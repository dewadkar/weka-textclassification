            Purchased the car in June 2000 and have never looked back.  This is my first Volvo and it replaced a five-year old Acura Integra (yuck - never again!).  It actually makes me glad I needed a wagon.

Horsepower - the car is a rocket.  Volvo is getting better than 100HP/liter with reliability (2.3L displacement, 247HP).  No need to elaborate.  The Auto-Stick transmission is fun for smoking those 'me first' jerks who try to guttersnipe you at intersections or cut in front on freeway on-ramps.

Handling - more than adequate for the car's designed purpose and better than just about any car I've ever owned.  I've ordered a set of Michelin Pilot Sports for it (stock Pirellis are dust after 22k miles), which should up the response a notch.

Safety - the SRS network is another major plus, although it's got to cost a fortune to replace them should they ever get sprung.

Looks - for me, it's a tossup between the 2000 model year and the current design as to which is better looking; although clearly the new XC is sphincter-ugly.  It looks like that stupid new Chevy truck with the plastic Batmobile crap everywhere.  The 2000 XCs were gorgeous, so why did they screw it up?

Roominess - I'm 6-4 and completely comfortable inside (the front seat, that is).  Anyone over 5-8 is in trouble in back, unless the front seats are moved up, which then cramps the people in front.  The integrated child booster seats are a major plus; one of the factors in choosing this car for me.  Split fold-down rear seats increase versatility.

Details - things like integrated garage door remote, security lights (activated with the remote) and trip computer make all the difference.

Anyone needing a wagon, but still desiring performance for those times when the kids aren't with you should seriously consider this car.  My only regret is that Volvo didn't see fit to resurrect the 'R' model wagon (put 300HP and AWD in this thing and you could get into all kinds of mischief).

This car is highly recommended.
