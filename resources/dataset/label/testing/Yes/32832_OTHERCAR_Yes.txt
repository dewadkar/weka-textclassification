            Ahhh, my first(and current) car.  What an experience it is.  I now see why so many people get attached to their first car. I am totally in love with my cavy. I purchased a used 1995 2 door automatic for $2700 from a wholesaler with approximately 82,000 miles on it.  This car has been nothing but a dream to own.  First off the day I went to test drive it the head gasket went on it, which is pretty typical on these cars due to the short distance the gasket covers along with the bolts that the head attaches to. The gasket was replaced the next day, and I decided to buy it. Ever since then I have not had any major problems, and thoroughly enjoy driving and modding my car. 

For some really great information and good ideas as to what these cars can do check out www.j-body.org. I am a current member and I get loads of information from the site. It not only shows you the potential of these cars, but it gets the owners together every year in Lordstown, Ohio, the birthplace of the cavalier, to spend some time admiring other J-Bodies and showing off their own. The J-Body line also includes the Pontiac Sunfire, Sunbird and J2000, Olds Firenza, Buick SkyHawk and Cadillac Cimarron. All of these are fine choices. Anyone who owns one of these cars and realizes their true potential knows just how much fun they can be. 

In order to have fun with these cars, or any car, you have to accept the fact that these are cars we are talking about and the fact that none of them are perfect and that it will be necessary every once in a while to put some money into them for maintenance. By this I don't mean changing the oil and air filter; I mean that you may have to spend $200 to replace the head gasket or anything along those lines. If you buy any car without first researching common problems then YOU are the one at fault, not the company who manufactured the car.
