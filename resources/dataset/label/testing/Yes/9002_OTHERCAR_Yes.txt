            I recently purchased a 2001 Kia Soprtage back in June of 2001. My wife, 2 kids and I had shopped all of the usual car dealers looking for a second car with a little more room than the present car we have.. We looked and looked. What it finally came down to was what we could afford. We narrowed it down and the one that came out of the pack was the Kia Sportage. We got the basic model with a few options to sport it up a bit. We opted for a CD player, Rear wiper, Roof rack, Keyless entry, and  Alloy wheels. 

The Sportage comes with many, many standard features. Some of these features include: Power locks, steering, windows, mirrors, Tilt Steering wheel, Digital Clock, AM/FM stereo, Cup Holders(front and rear), and too many more to mention. One of Kia�s �sticks� is that there are so many standard features than any other car or SUV on the market. You know what they are right. Not may cars come standard with all of this stuff, especially power everything, and a radio. 

Here are some specs of the Kia Sportage that I looked at before I bought it.

I was impressed with the features on this SUV. I test drove it and it had some pep, but not a whole lot, but there was enough power when you had to use it. There seemed to be more get up and go in the manual transmission than in the automatic. I did notice that it shifted smooth and flawless. The clutch was easy to press down and operate. The dashboard is laid out in a nice plan. The air/heat is right there in the center with temp control and fan speed. Right above that are 2 big vents for the air/heat. Below the vents is the cup holder. Press once and it slides out with 2 holders, press back in and it locks. There is also a digital clock. Below the air/heat controls is the radio. We upgraded to a CD player. Nice stereo, 6 speaker system, with base, treble, balance, and front/back control. The CD player played nice. No skipping or jumping, even while riding on a bumpy road. There is also a center island with a storage compartment and an armrest that adjusts forward and back to fit your arm. The only problem is that once the cup holders are out you cannot see the temp controls for the air/heat. 

The drivers seat is comfortable and roomy. I am 5�11�� and had no problem with leg or headroom. The drivers side also has seat lumbar adjustment, footrest and tilt steering wheel adjustment. All of the window controls are on the driver�s door. You may also lock out anyone else from rolling down there windows. Especially good when you have kids that love to touch every button and switch. The passenger side felt the same as the driver�s side. Right in front of the seat is a glove compartment that has lots of room for all of your stuff. There is also a map holder in the visor on the passenger side and driver�s side.

Now to the back seats. I was impressed with the amount of room in the back seats. It is a bench seat with high backs for comfort. The seats also fold down for more cargo room. There is an ashtray and cup holder on the center console. I have two children who both are still in car seats and I fit them easily in the back seat. There is plenty of room for another car seat if it is necessary. There are also 3 tether anchors on the floor of the cargo space in the back.  With the seats in the upright position there is ample cargo space in the back of the vehicle. I will put it this way when my family and I went to Disney World and took 2 big suitcases and one little one. A double stroller, playpen and many other things and had plenty of room. The ride over there was comfortable and enjoyable. The car drives smooth. I did notice that when your speed gets to be over 70mph, a gust of wind will make the car move slightly, but it is not that bad.

The gas mileage for this car is  very good. Through manual transmission it gets 20 city/ 23 highway. For automatic it gets 18 city/ 21 highway. I only have to fill up the tank once every week and a half. I travel 40 miles per day to and from work on a manual transmission. 

I have only had it in the shop 2 times, once to adjust the alignment and fix the back windows, the other time was for the 3000-mile oil change and tune up. Other than that I have not had any problems at all. The car is running just like new. 

The warranty is one of the best assets. It is 10 year or 100,000 mile limited powertrain warranty. It also includes a 5 year or 60,000 mile limited basic warranty, 5 year or 100,000 mile limited anti-perforation and a 5 year unlimited mile road side assistance plan. 

I was very impressed with all features of this SUV. I would recommend this to someone that wants a bigger car then the one that they have and is on a limited budget. There were only a few negative points that I have had with this car so far. I will be keeping this SUV for as long as it keeps running.
