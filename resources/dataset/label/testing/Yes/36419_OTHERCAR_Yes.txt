            I have owned my 1995 Subaru Imprezza since 1997.  It has proven to be a very dependable and reliable car.  

Living at times in West Virginia, and some in Maryland, I am used to hard winters.  Subaru is one of the best cars for driving in snow, sleet and rain.  The body has held up very well (except for the rude driver in the parking lot that left a large dent in the side.) under the circumstances of being continually pelted with rock salt, cinder, and the like during the winter months.

It has ample trunk space for a family of 4 to pack for a long trip.  And is comfortable to drive and be a passenger in.

The 5 speed transmission has performed without flaw, though I must admit that I'm not all that great with a clutch.  The engine has need little maintainance except the usual oil change and fluid top offs.  

The suspension is rock solid, even with all my 'curb-shots'.  The ride is smooth and the brake pads and braking system has functioned great in all types of weather.

The all wheel drive feature is my favorite.  It goes anywhere, and with great gas mileage. (I get about 30 mpg on the open highway)

I currently have 70,000 miles on my Impreza and  believe that I will still be driving it far into the new millenium.<br><br>
