            It all started out when I couldn't help but love the new &quot;pretty boy&quot; look of the re-designed Chevrolet Silverado in the beginning of the 1999 model year. I was all up and glamorous about getting one, but hesitated awhile because of the 4th door option not being available untill the 2003 model year (or so the dealer said at the time). Well, time came when I went to the dealer and kept bugging him about getting me one. Thing was, being the son of a GM Production Supervisor, Johnny Young (Sales Rep.) didn't want to sell me one at discount. Well, to make a long story short, time came on January 25th (one day after my birthday) when Johnny Young had called and said that the order went through on the computer and that the truck was being built on February 28th! I was sooo happy I couldn't withstand my joy! I kept waiting and waiting as days went by! Finally the day came when the truck arrived! I was sooo happy! I know this will take a long time, so i'll TRY and sum it up. Drove to dealer, saw truck, gawked at truck, talked to Johnny Young, inspected truck, gawked and drooled at the seven-pin round plug, told him I'd be back Wednesday to pick it up. Yea yea, i know i know, for as crazy as I am about this truck, why would I pick it up Wednesday and not that day (Thursday)?? Well the 6 days I would have to wait, I would have more $$$ in the bank, so I would have to wait a bit! Well, time came when I was to pick it up and I went through all that paper-work, blah blah blah, and finally drove home! I couldn't help but putting the windows down, activating the heaters in the seats, and blasting the music I had taken with me! However, I couldn't do much, considering pop's was right behind me in his '00 LT sub! He had already honked his horn behind me two times, after noticing the race I had with a white F150, and two kids in it, thinking they have something &quot;special!&quot; 
Well as for now, as almost 1 week has gone by, this truck already has 200 miles on it, been driven every single day, is a &quot;go-getter grociery machine&quot; and hauls the jetboat and airstream every single day between home and jobsite. I dont think... no... I KNOW I could not possibly ask for a better truck to do the job! I'm hoping to sell sometime around September when the new Duramax Diesel (300HP and 520 lb/ft of torque!) and the big 8.1L Vortec V-8 (340HP and 455lb/ft of torque) come out! Hopefully, the GMC Terradyne might have made it to production then, so I could think about purchasing one of those. <br><br>
