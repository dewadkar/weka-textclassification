            I should have gotten this car instead of my chev tahoe. I love my tahoe, but you kinda get sick of it after a while. I wanna the sportiness of the beeemer. It is very smooth and &quot;phat.&quot; A bunch of my friends drive this sexy car, and they tell me of what I missed out on. The car is one powerful animal, and can keep up with many sports cars. It could settle as a family car, or just as someones &quot;phat beauty of a  ride.&quot; The car has great handling and amazing breaks as most bmw's do. It is what you would expect from the german company and much more. It comes with many options including bright halogen lights, Abs breaks and much more. I would recommend that if you are looking for a great car that will last you for a long long time, choose the new bmw 328i. You will never want another car ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
