            Hi,
My husband and I just got an Olympus D-360 digital camera for Christmas! What a great gift. Finally, we have one. We have other cameras, but with this one we don't have to worry about film. I forgot a camera and had this one to shoot pictures with. I was doing research on digital cameras early on and if you don't know what you're looking for you can get cheated. The most important thing I found out was to make sure you check out how much memory it comes with and if memory can be upgraded. With this camera, it comes an 8MB card, but can be upgraded up to 64MB card.
The features are great. You can view the pictures on the view finder, you can view the recorded pictures on the view finder, you can view the pictures on your tv also. The camera comes with software for the PC and the Mac so you can edit the pictures and then send them to a printer. It also has a date &amp; time stamp, and battery indicator.
This camera is good for the simple person or family who doesn't have a lot of money. It's a good price for the features it has. The only thing that doesn't have I wish it did was a zoom feature. But, you can download the pictures to the computer and zoom them in that way.
The software it comes with is easy to install. It comes in the PC and the Mac version. Pictures can be edited before they get sent to the printer. It is also great to download pictures as they can also be sent via email to anyone. The camera comes with easy instructions for anyone to follow. So, aim, shoot and you're ready to go!<br><br>
