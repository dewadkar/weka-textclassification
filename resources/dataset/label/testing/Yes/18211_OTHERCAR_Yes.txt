            First thing.  Before you go buy a car, go to www.personallogic.com and go though the automobile decision maker.  I used to study decision making and found that this site had the most helpful tool for helping me make a decision about a car.  In fact, it suggested the Acura.  The upshot is that I love the car and I have Personal Logic to thank for it.

The meat.  I own a 1998 Integra.  I got the GS, cloth seats.  I must say that Acura did an excellent job of putting in the options that I care about and leaving out the fluff.  Sun Roof, CD player, power doors and locks.  No heated seats.  No driving computer.

The car is very peppy, even after a year of driving.  The handling is excellent.  Every time I drive another car, I moan about how clunky it is compared to the Acura.  The car is a little noisy, but I find it is solidly built.  Suspension is fairly tight.  You are going to feel the bumps.[Update: I have now had the car for 2 years and am still happy with the pep.  It is a little less responsive, but still good.]

The interior is, for the most part, excellent.  The lone exception is the radio.  I find that it is hard to operate the radio and drive at the same time.  It is just too far away.  I would also like it if the seats moved back a little further.  Plenty of storage room.  Seats are fine.  Not the greatest in comfort, but acceptable. I will say that with the seats down, the car has an enormous carrying capacity.  You can take even the heaviest packer to the airport.  Having said that, the car is really not comfortable for more than two people.  I can't sit in the back seat comfortably.  If you have kids, it may be ok.

My one gripe is that the Air Conditioning is really bad.  I asked my dealer about it and he said that Acura was known for their bad A/C.  It takes a good 10 minutes to cool down.  If A/C is important to you, you will be annoyed with the Integra.

One thing that is often neglected in these reviews is the dealer network.  If you are going to buy an Acura and you have an option, get it from one of their &quot;Precision Team&quot; dealers.  These are dealers who service levels were rated in the top 10 percent of customer satisfaction.  I must say that I love my service department.  

If you want a BMW 325 (which does ride better) but can only spend less than 20K, the Acura is a great choice.  I am going to get another once the lease runs out.[Update: not sure any more.  I might go up a model, but I am definitly staying with Acura.]

[update: I have been using the car for long trips recently, and find that my legs (I am 5'11&quot;) are a little to long to be comfortable on these drives.  I spent a lot of time moving my legs trying to get comfortable.  It is not a terrible flaw, but if I were doing a lot of driving, I would go with a different car.]<br><br>
