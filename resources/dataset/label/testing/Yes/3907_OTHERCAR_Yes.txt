            I have never owned a mini van, nor would I, but on some rare occasion if I did, this would be the one for me.  I am just being honest when I say a mini van just isn't my style.  I currently drive a Durango with the third seat to fit the family comfortably.
  
This past week I went to Florida with my two kids, my mother, my sister, her two kids, and my uncle.  There was just no possible way to fit in the Lincoln that I drive when I am there, so we rented a van.  From what I have heard, vans are great with kids and extra people but not so great on gas.  The 2001 Oldsmobile Silhouette was Awesome in every way!!! 

It drives so smoothly, you would really believe you were driving a car yet holds 7 passengers very comfortably.  There are 2 seats in front, 2 in the middle, and a bench seat in the rear, plus plenty of storage room behind the rear seats for luggage or anything else.  

My favorite feature was the automatic door.  Both side doors open but one opens automatically by either the remote on the key ring or by a button between the front and middle seat.  Being in the Florida sun at 90+ degrees, it really makes a difference when you can open the door from across a parking lot to let some of the heat out before you and your cranky kids attempt to load into a hot vehicle.

The gas mileage was also a great feature.  It got about 20 miles per gallon the entire week.  The section of Florida that I drive in is all city with a lot of traffic lights. I am sure it does even better on the highway.  Every gadget was fully acessable from the drivers seat.  Many interior lights, door locks, windows, radio, etc.  The seats are extremely comfortable and didn't irritate my sensitive back one bit.  

The kids loved the soft seats and the room to move in them.  They didn't get restless because they had plenty of room for their bags of toys and activities right in front of them.  The kids also loved being able to climb in and out very easily.  The Oldsmobile Silhouette sits close to the ground for easy entrance and exit.  It also has handles at the passenger side and both side entrances for kids and elderly people to hold on to while getting in or out.  This worked perfect for my 84 yr. old uncle. 

Although I will admit, I didn't use every feature of this van, I was highly impressed with all that I did use. Everyone was comfortable and very satisfied with this the 2001 Oldsmobile Silhouette.  It was well worth the 54.00 per day.
