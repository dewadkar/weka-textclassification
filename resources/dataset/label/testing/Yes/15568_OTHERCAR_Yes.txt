            I LOVE my handicap-equipped Astro van! The one I had previously was huge. If you're wheelchair-bound &amp; need a van, first go to the people who will be equipping your van to accommodate your wheelchair. Select the &quot;lift&quot; you're comfortable with. From them, get a list of vans-which can accommodate your chair &amp; lift- with a door-opening wide enough &amp; enough head-room for you in your chair or on your scooter. THEN,start looking.
The Astro van that I selected is 100% easier to drive, park and access than the Ford Club wagon I had before.

In order to install lift equipment &amp; accommodate a wheelchair, the seat behind the driver's seat has to be removed.With this modification, there is still room in the back for passengers.
