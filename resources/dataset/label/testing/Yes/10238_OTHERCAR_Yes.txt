            I am fairly new to the RX300, having only owned one for three weeks, but from what I've seen, I made the right choice.

I had driven a Jeep Cherokee Limited for seven years, and was anxious to get into something more refined, but with the utilitarian features I had enjoyed with the Jeep.

After comparing the Lexus with its competitors from Ford, Toyota, Mercedes and Isuzu, I felt it was well worth the extra money (about the same as the Mercedes, at least) to step up to the Lexus.

First off, it really does ride like a sedan. In normal driving conditions, the RX shields you from the elements nicely. My first time at the helm I noticed that I could hear myself breathe while driving 50mph. A far cry from the Jeep, indeed! When put to hard manuvering, the RX shows its height and tire size by being a little reluctant to make the corners at full speed, but when you factor in the size of the vehicle, it actually handles quite well in virtually all conditions.

And when it comes right down to it, you're driving a Lexus. True to Lexus form, the fit and finish on the RX is flawless. From the soft leather seats and accents to the walnut wood on the console, you know that this is a well built car.

The available sound systems are quite good. I ended up going for the Pioneer system, as the Nakamichi didn't seem to justify its extra money. The CD-changer is located in the spacious glove box, and it's fairly easy to change cartridges while driving, as long as you've got another one loaded up with discs.

Overall, I love it!<br>
