            We needed a vehicle to hold more than 5 people.  We didn't want a minivan because we just didn't like the look and the 'stigma' they carry.  But, after seeing the Sienna and test driving it, we were pleasantly surprised.  It is VERY roomy inside.  It drives very much like a Camry, on which it is based.  It's a very smooth ride.

I've found that it is a bit difficult to park.  The round body and hood that drops at a sharp angle, makes it difficult to see where your front bumper is.  That is my ONLY complaint.

We debated over the Sienna and the Honda Odyssey, but when we couldn't even find an Odyssey to test drive and heard the horror stories about people paying over sticker, the Sienna was the obvious choice.  A friend of a friend owns an Odyssey.  I do like the fold-down back bench seat feature, but otherwise, the Sienna is very much the same. The owners drove both the Sienna and Odyssey and felt that the Sienna was a more smooth ride.  They also commented on the difficulty in parking the Odyssey.

I'm very happy with our Sienna.  A VERY good purchase!<br><br>
