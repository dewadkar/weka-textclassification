            Excellent in room and in comfort as well as sturdy, durable and all in all reliable. The 3-door option is excellent for family, friends, or work situations. Cargo space is more than adequate in even the short bed. Although I am currently leasing the 2000 Silverado, I am almost persuaded to purchase it at the end of the lease. I would say if anyone is considering a 'real' truck that is capable of performing up to standards that one would associate with a dependable pickup truck, then the 2000 Silverado 1500 is the best option to consider.  Mine was listed at $24,000
With a 3year lease, after which i have option to purchase it at $12000.
