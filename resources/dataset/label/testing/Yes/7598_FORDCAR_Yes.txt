             I leased this vehicle in 1998 and it was the best suv i have been in!  I leased a eddie baur and it was awesome. I leased this vehicle because i needed something to haul my stuff around and make trips back and fourth to and from chicago.  The four wheel drive works very well on the ice.  I loved the vehicle for many reasons.

I had tan leather and four wheel drive,if you want to talk about sound this had the mach290 audio system with seven premium speakers and 290 watts of power equiped with a six disc changer it sounded great bass,treble,and mids. I didn't like the fact that it was a gas hog with the 5.4 litre triton V8. It cost about $45.00 everytime I went to the gas station, but other then that this was an awesome vehicle i would buy it if I could, but I didn't have the money. 

I found this vehicle to live up to its promise its a ford and thats all i buy!The adventurest should buy this vehicle to take it to its max,or parents with several children. You shouldn't buy this if your not going to put it to its standards.<br><br>
