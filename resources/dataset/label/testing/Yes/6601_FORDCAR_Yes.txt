            I just purchased a 1999 Ford F150 XLT SuperCab for $16,999.  That price was the number one selling point.  For a Chevrolet equipped the way
this XLT is equipped would have cost 3 to 4 grand more.  I love the
seats with the fold down arm rest and the 4-doors that Chevrolet is
only thinking about as an &quot;extra cost&quot; option.  It window stickered 
out at $23,965....then Ford threw in a $295 discount for the extra
large tires!  Then another $500 for the 4.2 litre V6 engine, and another
$500 for the manual 5-speed transmission (doesn't anyone drive a 
stick anymore??), and thats not all.  Next came the $500 discount for
something called a &quot;TX/OK/LA&quot; discount, then $805 for an air conditioning
discount, and finally a discount of $375 for Anti-lock Brakes.  That's
a total savings of $2,975 off that original sticker of 23,965 to
bring down the total to $20,990.  WOW, that's almost like giving it
away.  Then the dealer adds his discount of $3991 to get the price to
the magic number of $16,999.  No matter how you slice it, it's a lot
of truck for the money.  Seats six, looks great, hauls anything I can
throw at it, and get 21 miles per gallon on the highway.  Worse I've
seen has been 18.  I've seen a lot of cars that wouldn't get that 
much in town.  Did I mention that the XLT comes with POWER everything?
Power windows, locks, steering, brakes, cruise control and AM/FM with
cassette player.  What more could you ask for.  I love it and any one
looking for a hard working truck that looks good should look at the
Ford F150 Supercab....walk the lot and check the window stickers for
the different discount packages on them.  You'll be surprised!! <br><br>
