            This car was so good my wife stole it and left me with the Fiat.
Working in the UK in 97/98 my family car was the BMW5231. While BMW usually use the last few denominate engine size, the BMW actually has 2.5 liter engine (which in my mind is simple because the Mercedes E230 with brand new 4 pot 2.3 liter was giving the BMW engine too much of a run for its money..). Either way this was my car and I graciously bought my wife a Fiat Punto 5dr 55 SX (fully loaded 55 bhp 1 liter engine and fast as hell..)

I had just come out of the latest Mercedes E230 - great car, very comfortable, well put together, neat styling but..no soul. Soul? Yep, cars are alive, they breath, and when they have soul that's when you know you have a good one. The BMW has lots! It does everything the Mercedes does but better. 

Ride and handling is much better than most in its class. Performance is good the 2.5 liter straight six (apart from being a neat design) is well tuned and powers the car just as well on tight bendy/hilly roads as well as high speed Autobahns. The Mercedes may be a bit more comfortable but the difference is minimal. The real edge that the BMW has is that it corners like a roller skate. It has a gutsy engine which picks up really well out of tight corners. The suspension and wear wheel drive is tight enough that when you steam into corners and overdo it a bit then it is reasonably eay to correct and keep on the black stuff. That's when you actually have the car to play with.....

Wife and kids commandeered the car because it was bigger and had ABS, Airbags etc, also when they went on trips across the UK it was a more rational choice. Ends up they had it quite a lot leaving me with my little Italian friend (fantastic car by the way especially the sport version..and they don't rust anymore..but that'll be a seperate story.

Frankly there are no better cars than the 5 series range in this class on the market. Jaguar S type comes close but no cigar - it fails in a number of areas and tries to make up for it by looking pretty inside - so far am not convinced but I reserve total judgment for the time being. The Mercedes is fine but lacks soul. The new Alfa Romeo had just arrived and while they look great and have great reviews (especially V6 engine) I haven't driven it so cannot comment. Lexus - no thanks. I have tried to like them believe me but I always end up feeling cold after the experience. The Lexus has less soul than the Mercedes.

Only one design issue I had with the car was that with rear windows down the noise was unbearable at speeds between 50 - 70 mph..the answer was to either go faster or shut the windows and listen to music on the 6 speaker sound system.

So if you are looking for the best in this class its pretty easy - shame that there is so little competition and that your significant other might just sneak those keys away.
