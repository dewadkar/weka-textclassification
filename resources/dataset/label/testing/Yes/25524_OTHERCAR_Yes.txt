            I have had this truck for about 2 years now and haven't had a problem with it yet. My Red 1995 Mazda B2300 standard transmission\extended cab pickup is the best driving truck I've ever had. The power steering and easy push clutch proves for a fun and easy drive to wherever my heart desires to go. I have taken numorous trips to Dallas\Fort Worth, Oklahoma, and even Austin without any trouble. It has very comfortable bucket seats in the front and two fold away back seats that aren't very roomy but can fit two grown bodies. The ride is very smooth and with the 4 speaker system give you great sound quality. The Am\Fm Deck picks up almost any station within a 130 mile radious. From Wichita Falls I can pick up a couple Dallas stations pretty clearly. If you looking for a truck that will last you a life time with limited amount of trouble, go with the mazda b-series pickups and have fun.<br><br>
