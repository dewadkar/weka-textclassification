            I recently purchased the new Hp photosmart 318, and was impressed by its small size, and stylish looks.  It is a 2.3 mega pixel camera with very easy to use controls.  It has a two times digital zoom and three picture mode settings, good (400X600 medium compression, good for web sites and e-mail)  better ( 1800X1200 medium compression good for pictures you plan to print 5X7 or smaller)  and best ( 1800X1200 low compression good for pictures you plan to print up to about 8X10) It has a built in flash with auto, red eye, fill, and flash off modes, good for objects up to about eight feet. This camera has a fixed lens and requires at least 8 inches for macro shots. It comes with 8 megs of built in memory that will give you roughly 113 pics in good, 13 in better, and 7 in best mode, and is also expandable by way of a compact flash card slot but does not come bundled with one.  This camera features two Lcd displays, one small energy saving one on top witch displays battery status, pictures left, flash mode etc. and the larger 1.8 inch color Lcd Screen on the back to let you preview photos, and run through the cameras menus.  You may preview photos one at a time, as well as in thumbnail mode, and you can also zoom in on your photos to see them more clearly.  The camera has a built in ten second timer, and tri-pod mount, and also has three short cut buttons on the top including picture quality mode, 1,2,or three stars, flash mode, and a zoom and timer button.  The cameras layout is nice and features the Lcd screen to the left of the camera so when your holding it your thumb does not cover the screen.  The camera uses and comes with four AA batteries.  It is also able to use rechargable batteries which is not the case with other Hp digital cameras like the 215.  I have used rechargable 1700mah Nimh batteries in mine and hit about 220 pictures before the camera indicated that the batteries were at half strength.  I also like that the camera is very quiet.  I found the picture quality to be very good and pick up excellent detail and colour. It is very easy to use and small enough so that you wont mind putting it in your pocket, and carrying it around. The cameras pics are downloadable via USB and comes bundled with both Mac and Windows software.
