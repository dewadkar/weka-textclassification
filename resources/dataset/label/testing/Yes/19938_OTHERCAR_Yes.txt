            I bought a 1993 Celica GT in January of 1998. This was honestly the best vehicle purchase I have ever made!  I love the sporty way it handles without the ridiculous cost of a true &quot;sports car.&quot; Very tight steering,  no swaying around corners, and the low to the ground profile make the Celica GT an exciting car to drive. (Not to mention the head-turning sporty lines and tight engine hum) You always get attention when driving this beauty.

I personally feel it has plenty of power with it's 2.2 liter engine. The car is solid and very stable. The sun-roof which tilts up or slides open is really fun but does take-up more head room. A 6 foot man has close quarters (but never complains about feeling cramped) The rear seats are deep buckets. Very cozy but not for big people.

The interior is plush and all hard areas are covered with a high quality leather-like material. (Many compliments here) I do have a wind noise that I have not tried to fix yet (door or window?)

There is a bit of road noise with this car but the low-profile tires contribute here. Did I mention the premium factory sound system? Just turn it up!!

The best thing about this car is the reliability. Never been in the shop since I bought it even with 90+ thousand miles!

It's been from the mountains for skiing trips to the beach in Mexico and I never worry about it getting me home.
