                 My parents went skiing a few months ago and borrowed my Isuzu Trooper for the trip through the mountains.  In exchange I drove my Mom's Sebring and was pleasantly surprised.

     First of all the car just flat looks good.  Her's is red and I must admit I was feeling pretty darn cool cruising around with the top down, and shades on in the red convertible (never mind the fact it was 50 degrees and overcast).

     The other things about the Sebring that I liked were the ease and efficiency of taking the top down and putting it back up, all with the push of a button, wow I loved that feature.  Everything was automatic and the car came with a great stereo system and 5 CD disc player standard.  It's not an incredibly fast car but for what you spend she's got plenty of get up and go.

      The Sebring drives great, very smooth and the handling is great.  The term &quot;hugs the road,&quot; is overused when discussing a cars handling but darn it this car &quot;hugs the road.&quot;  I would recommend this car to anyone looking at getting a convertible without breaking the bank.  Personally, I'm an SUV guy myself but I might be giving my wife a gentle nudge in this direction when we look for her next car.<br><br>
