            In 1998 I purchased my 1995 Ultra with 36K miles with all the options from Marvin K. Brown. We have always enjoyed driving around in it.  The only problem is the continual repairs.  The turbo-charger broke about a year after the purchase at about 46K miles.  The cost to repair was about 2K and the mechanic said that it will continue to run without it, but would loose some gas mileage and some power.  We decided to let it go.  At 49K miles the transmission went out and it cost us $1600 to replace it a Sparky's Transmission in La Mesa, CA. Since then the A/C front vents no longer work, the electrical windows have failed a couple times (about $200 each time to repair), the CD-Player has always been recalcitrant, and of course there are the usual repairs of belts, water pumps, etc. that one would expect.  Here is now at 90K miles and it is back into the shop.  Ah, the cost of comfort....
