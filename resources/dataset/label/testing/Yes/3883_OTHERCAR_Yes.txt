            Two boys active in soccer and there team need rides to games and practices is what caused me to begin my search for a minivan.Seating for seven is the greatest asset, not to mention how easily the seats can be reconfigured, even my 11 and 13 year old boys can take out and rearrange the seats to meet our changing needs.The 6 cyl. is a must. I took the Voyager on vacation in the Blue Ridge mountains and had no trouble handling steep inclines. This vehicle is very comfortable and quiet.Extra power outlet in the back allows both my kids to use there video games without using up all their batteries and fighting over one outlet.One design flaw I believe exists in the interior lighting, instead of one dome light,courtesy lights for passengers in the rear would be very welcomed. This would allow for reading or playing of games in the back at night without affecting the driver. If you like a cool vehicle AC is a must but don't overlook the tint windows so your passengers in the rear can keep cool.Overall, I am very pleased with the selection I made, but I do wish I had gotten power locks instead of reaching all the way across this roomy van to unlock the doors.
