            When I finally decided that it was time to buy a digital camera, I was astounded by how many there were to choose from.  I spent weeks researching which cameras would be compatible with my USB iMac.  When my choices were narrowed down, I knew that my best bet was the Epson PhotoPC800.  Why not?  I have an Epson Stylus 740 printer and it would work with the camera as well.

Using the camera is pretty easy, but to fully use all the features it is important to read the manual.  The manual is an easy and well illustrated read.

The camera takes color shots, black and white shots and panoramic shots.  It also has the capability to record sound bytes of what is occurring as you take the shot (although it takes up a lot of space).  The user can also take his/her pic of the quality of picture they prefer.  Although, the higher the quality, the more memory used.  I always use the lesser quality and get 118 pictures.  The quality is awesome and is evident on my webpage.  An example can be found at http://www.bariboisvert.com/newfound1.jpg.

The software, Image Expert, that comes with the camera is easy to use and allows users to create online photo albums.  

I love my camera and it was probably one of the wisest computer based I've made to date!<br><br>
