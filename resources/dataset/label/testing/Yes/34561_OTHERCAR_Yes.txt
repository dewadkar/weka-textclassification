            let me begin by stating that I like the QX4. I leased this vehicle fall of 1999. I was also considering the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Lexus RS300, and the Toyota 4Runner. I Obviously wasn't looking for a large or serious SUV, but rather a luxury car with some mild off-road potential. And I'd be lying if I said the name didn't mean anything. I did my research on-line and found the mild reviews of the QX4 compared well to that of the grand cherokee and the 4-runner (the car-platform Lexus is too much of a compromise for me). I was initially leaning towards the Grand Cherokee; it offers the best overall performance will fair ride comfort and amenities. But the salesman gave me a bad vibe, and the Cherokee really is over-valued, as is the 4 Runner. Then again, no luxury SUV is ever under-valued. My final decision was based on the realization that although no SUV is practical, the QX4 is built on a solid platform (inherited qualities from the Nissan Pathfinder) and carries the name recognition of Infinity. The biggest complaint is the V6 engine that was carried over from the Maxima (or so I'm told). I don't mind the lack of power, but the gas mileage is unforgivable. In addition, living in Pennsylvania I experience some severe cold fronts and the engine showed some serious effort turning over in the morning. But aside from that, it's a fine choice.<br><br>
