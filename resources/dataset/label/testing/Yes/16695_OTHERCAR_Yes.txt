                 I bought this camera at Wal-Mart just before a boat ride to Cozumel.  Never having owned a Digital camera I was looking for something that would do some specific jobs:
            A. High Resolution
            B. Floppy Storage
            C. Short Video capability
            D. Rugged
            E. Reasonably large aperture
     I was able to take some wonderful images on the trip to Cozumel. The price of film will pay for this camera.  Floppies are reusable.  Computer images are really the way to go for Photography &amp; this camera has the feel and comfort of a 35mm without the cumbersome bag of lenses.  
      The close up capability is incredible.  One can get right in the face of and insect and catch him at lunch.  Having studied (after the fact) some of the prices listed on the web, I learned that I probably paid a bit much for the camera but still came in under the suggested retail price.   
       Having tried several cameras on the night sky, I was somewhat disappointed that the night sky is largely impossible with this instrument.  Still I was able to capture some stars at night. I would be interested in others relating to me their positive experiences with photographing the night sky with this instrument. 
       I found the instructions to be clear and informative, but the camera needs to be studied just a bit before it becomes useful.  The scope of possibilities, from black and white inky drawings to full glorious color all correctable at the computer is and astounding pallet.  
        For someone thinking of investing large sums in an SLR I would suggest including this in the package if not instead of an SLR.  It certainly is a versatile camera.
       This camera comes packed with a rechargeable battery system that is a real plus in savings over purchasing endless supplies of batteries.  The thing just does not require regular batteries.  Its internal battery is easily recharged.  
       One of the cables that is packed with the camera facilitates viewing the images over an ordinary television.  Prices range from 500 to 800 dollars, but again the cost of film, batteries, lenses, and development to do the same thing with a standard SLR pays for the camera.
       The trip to Cozumel was full of photographic possibilities, everything from the rainbow over Playa Del Sol to the flower at the edge of the jungle on the north shore was captured beautifully. The screw ups were all correctable and the really stupid shots were politely deleted.
We are really happy with this camera.  It easily met criteria I was looking for in a camera.
