            I consider myself a fairly experienced digital photographer, having owned six digital cameras, and taking thousands of photos with them. I owned two epson's, a cannon, and three Nikon's. I have used the coolpix 700, the 800, 950 and now the 990. I have had the 990 for about a year. The 990 takes very rich and sharp photographs. It has an above average lens that takes excellent macros down to less than an inch, and extends to a 3x. The macros are really amazing. No other camera comes close. I believe it focuses down to 3cm. Its also a great portrait lens. The features also are great. The shutter and aperature priority are very useful. Many times I will use manual and choose a shutter of 1/125 or 1/250 when photographing children or friends. This assures that the automatic mode doesnt choose a borderline 1/60 and blur the shot slightly. Most times automatic is fine, but its nice to be able to have the options. Its important say at a soccer game to be able to choose the shutter speed. It also does very well with night shots. I print on an Epson photo 700 printer, and people cannot believe the large prints. Many say, they are the best photos theyve ever seen.The price is coming down now making it a very good buy.
