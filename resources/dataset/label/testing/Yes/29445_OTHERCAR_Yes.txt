            I just bought a 1999 JeepTJ Sahara for $23,000 a few tips about buying a Jeep. You might think that because the top comes off that you do not need air conditioner but guess what, YOU DO!. Nothing worse than the sun beeting on your head on a hot humid day.  Also another key thing you need on the jeep is full steel doors, I traded in a 1993YJ with half doors their was nothing I hated more than the half doors, after time you can no longer see out of the plastic windows the seal isn't as good and it can leak on you.  My Jeep now has hard doors and both tops, it's well worth it to get both tops for a little extra money because more than likely your going to want one or the other and the after market tops are not as good. The down side of jeeps are that their isn't much room.  Holiday shopping forget it! No place to put anything and with a soft top it's so easy to break into it all you have to do is unzip the windows and your in.  The only problem I have had with my jeep is the shift coming out of the transmission while 4wheelin but that was an easy fix. Gas mileage I get roughly 18mpg with the 4.0 6cyl with the top off I get about 14mpg. Over all I would recommend the Jeep to certain people.  You defently have to be a &quot;Jeepster&quot; otherwise you are not going to like the jeep.  So if you don't like rough rides and wind noise, the jeep isn't for you. The seats are pretty comfortable in my Sahara my friend has the base model and I must frown upon it.  I guess Jeep had to make a &quot;base&quot; model to compete with the lil &quot;Geo Tracker&quot; &quot;YUCK!&quot; but it's a shame because Jeep offers so much more!  You must drive a SAHARA!!!<br><br>
