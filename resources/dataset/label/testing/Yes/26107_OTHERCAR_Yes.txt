I have wanted a good digital camera for a long time. For a while I had
a camera with a floppy disk, i wont mention names.  It took ok pictures but the floppy's were bulky to carry everywhere.  I decided to try a camera with a flash card. I was on vacation in Reno, I just happened to go in to a pawn shop and they had just bought a Epson 750 Z photo pc digital camera the price was right so i bought it.
That was the best buy i could have made that was in July 2000, I have taken over 1000 pictures so far the resolution is awesome, My best friend
had a baby 3 weeks ago and i took pictures of the baby at 1 hr old then
e-mailed them to her mom 2000 miles away. She was amazed, she said the pictures were so clear she felt like she could feel the baby's skin
then i uploaded them to one of the online photo developers. when i got the pics back I was amazed they were just as good if not better than my
35mm. A couple weeks ago we all went water skiing, I was the designated
picture taker, while the boat was flying over the water i took pictures of the kids skiing and tubing behind the boat, 65 feet of tow rope between the camera and the subject the pictures were great!!!!!! The only problem was we could not see the kids faces. So i ordered a set of lens's
the 2x telephoto will capture the expressions on their faces. I printed
some out on photo paper.  The prints were great at 8 by 10.
At the lowest setting you get 178 pictures which are fine for web pages
or med setting you get 60 then at hypict which is 8 by 10 photo quality
you get about 20. but the good news is you can get up to a 480 meg card
which will get over 1000 hypics.  There is so much to say about this camera  - ease of use, led screen is so clear,  you can even magnify your image to see if you got what you want. This is the 1st camera i have ever seen this on. You can take pictures in black and white, color, panorama, different resolutions, all on the same card.  

Items it come with:
Camera  (with 4 meg internal memory)
Camera Bag
Video Cables to hook up to a TV
Computer cables for ibm compatible and mac
8 meg compact flash card
4 nimh rechargeable batteries (better then nicad)
Battery charger
Easy to understand instruction book
