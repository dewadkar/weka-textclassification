            I was a little apprehensive about getting a digital camera.  Wanted one that was easy.  Did not want to have to deal with more programs.  Decided the Sony Mavica was for me.  After learning that a MPG (movie) option was avail., was sure that was the one for me.  Now that I have it, I find I usually leave the picture quality on low because it is great for internet sharing with family and friends.  Several friends have admired my Sony and purchase one for themselves.  You are never out of film or memory because a floppy disc usually available.  Went to some spring training baseball games and took a bunch of floppies and JPGs.  Got home and found it was easy to transfer everything to a VCR tape so I could send it to the people we stayed with on vacation.  If your and average user like me this is the camera for you.  I used to spend hours scanning 35mm pictures for the internet.  Now its just plug and play.  I love it!  I bought an extra long life battery off of eBay and now I am ready to go!
