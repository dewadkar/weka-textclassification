            OK, this is my dad's truck.  It's not mine but I have done a lot of chores and driving in it.  This truck is great.

<b>Power:</b>  My dad's truck has the diesel and I think this truck could pull anything that a private person could have.  We use my dad's to pull an eight-horse trailer and a hay rack.  This truck does not have any problems even in the fields where you don't know exactly what the terrain will be like.  Passing is not a problem at all, even with the trailer.  It's a workhorse.

For the numbers people, there's two sets...For the automatic transmission, you get 235hp @ 2700 rpm and 460 lb/ft of torque from 1600 to 2700 rpm.  The horsepower is equal to that of the Ford F-350, but it lacks 40 lb/ft of torque.  On the other hand, the 6-speed manual transmission offers 245hp @ 2700 rpm and 505 lb/ft of torque from 1600 to 2700 rpm.  That is 10 more ponies and 5 more lb/ft than the F-350.

Even though the automatic is rated less, we have had no problems with my dad's.  Just be sure to always turn off overdrive before you tow anything.  This will save you headaches in the future.

<b>Interior:</b>  Now, my dad has the top of the line SLT Plus.  This includes leather, power driver's seat, CD and tape player, and the overhead console.  This ride makes you feel like you could drive for ever.  It really makes you feel like you're riding in any number of luxury cars.  The only problem I have is that you can't buy a Dodge with a crew cab.  This truck's back seat isn't comfortable for a long trip.  It gives you plenty of room for extra baggage, but it isn't comfortable for adults.

<b>Options:</b>  This truck has great options.  I mentioned a few of them but there are more, heated driver and passenger seats, and a security alarm.  I'm not big on the chrome wheel covers so, I would have to buy after-market wheels.

<b>Overall:</b>  This truck would be perfect for someone who doesn't have kids and has another way to haul 4 adults.  This makes the perfect second vehicle for a farmer or anyone who just wants a cool truck.  The truck does however, have it's bad points: no crew cab, ugly wheel covers, and a far out price.  Unfortunately, it's about even with the price of the other 1-ton trucks by Chevy and Ford.

So, if you're looking for an extended-cab and a diesel, then this will work just as well as the Ford.  If you're looking for a crew-cab and a diesel I would go with the Ford.  I have heard a lot of negative things about the current 6.5L Chevy diesel so, I would stay away from it.  If you're looking for a gas engine, then the Chevy is just as good as the others.  This is a pretty small niche in the market so, I don't think that one is all that much better than the other.  Unless of course, you're on of those people that always picks by the brand-name.<br><br>
