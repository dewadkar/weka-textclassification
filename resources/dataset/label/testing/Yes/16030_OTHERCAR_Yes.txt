            The superb engineering and reliability of this car make it the best car we have ever owned. My parents bought our 1993 Camry brand new in Dec. 1992. It is a good car with more power than you'll ever need and it has tons of room. The quality and craftsmanship of Toyota is unparalleled, and the car has been very reliable,  but we had to replace the front right side axle boot twice in two years, (which might have been because my dad might have ran over something sharp on the road). The only real problem I have with this car are the dealers who overcharge on maintenance and are usually rude and hard to deal with. <br><br>
