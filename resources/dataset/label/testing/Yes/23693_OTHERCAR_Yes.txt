            I travel approx. 40,000 miles a year in my cars.  I am always looking for a auto which will give me comfortable and reliable service.  Chrysler has become my new car of choice, and the Concorde gives you a lot of bang for the buck.

For many years I avoided buying Chrysler products because of their poor reliability reputation.  In 1996 I purchased a program LHS.  I put over 125,000 miles on it with just one trip for service.  I have now had my Concorde for over 40,000 miles and again, only one service visit (Electric window failure).

Mileage is good on the road (approx 26.5 mpg).  Car has great trunk space and rear seat leg room.

This car is a really good value.
