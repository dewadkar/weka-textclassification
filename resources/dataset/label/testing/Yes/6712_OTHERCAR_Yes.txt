            The year was 1998 and I was due any day with our third child.  The 1993 Dodge Colt we owned would not be large enough for two infant car seats and a toddler booster seat.  Not to mention we had already started experiencing problems with the transmission in the Colt.  The search began for a new vehicle.  We knew what we wanted in our new car.  It had to be spacious, dependable and suitable for a family of five as well as reasonably priced.  

With the help of my husbandï¿½s uncle we were able to find that very car.  We purchased a 1992 Chevy Lumina just weeks before our third son was born.  It was a real sigh of relief to know that now we had room for the whole family and no one would be cramped.  

Being a used car, we had it checked out and it appeared to be in fabulous condition but you still never know.  Two years later, my Lumina is still in great shape and has been one terrific car!  No mechanical problems to report thus far.  No visits to the shop for repairs of any sort other than the required maintenance required.  This just proves that an older car can be just as if not more so dependable than a brand new automobile bought from a new car lot.

The Lumina we own is a 4 door and with three children that feature is a MUST.   You get the sporty look and it is still a exceptional family car.  Impressive, Comfortable, Tried and true and Roomy all characterize the Chevy Lumina.  If a grade was given it would deserve an A+.
