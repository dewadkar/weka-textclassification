            I got my Insight a little over a week ago - and I really love it.  

I live in Canada and they're only just available here - Honda is only selling 300 2000's in Canada; I put a payment down over a month ago, and was lucky to get one so soon.

I got the Insight because I liked the concept and look.  Before I drove it, I was a little worried about a lack of power, but now I can say it feels just as peppy as a Civic, if not more so and easily goes 130km/h.  It's really fun to drive and everywhere I go, people come to take a look and ask questions.  The cargo space is limited, but good enough for most uses (commuting, groceries, shopping, going out).  I'm getting an average of 3.6L/100km (~68mpg) on my commute which is 20km on the highway and 10km in town.  Because there are no back seats at all, the two seats it does have are plenty roomy and comfortable. For commuting, it's the perfect car.  

The only 'cons' would be 1) the lacking rear visibility, but once you get used to it, it's perfectly safe, and 2) the price - but I figure I'll cover the cost difference over a Civic in about 8yrs of commuting, and have a less environmental guilt.

The idle shut-off is really cool - I should detail how that works exactly, since I couldn't find that out until I had the car:  If you've got the air-conditioner in 'econ' mode, the engine is up to temperature and the battery has plenty of power, when you depress the clutch after driving in 3rd gear or up and touch the break, as soon as you're going less than 30km/h, the engine turns off.  So, when coming to a stop, you naturally break first in gear, so the regenerative breaking charges the batteries, then when the engine feels like it wants you to shift down, you naturally just puts the clutch down and keeps breaking.  At this point, the engine shuts off and you coast to a stop.  When you put it in gear (including 2nd, if you're still rolling) the engine starts up immediately.  The engine is so quiet and the startup so immediate and smooth that if you've got the fan or the radio on you likely won't notice the feature at all.  

Anyway, you can check out some photos of my car at:
