            I purchased my four door Acura Integra new in 1994 for $17,000 which included taxes and license.  It is a bare bones vehicle with manual transmission, air conditioning and no frills whatsoever. I am the only owner of this car and it has 106,000 miles on it.

It still runs beautifully. It has no rattles or creaks.  Everything on it works the same as the day I bought it.  I have had to replace the brakes twice, tires twice, windshield wipers twice, and had a problem with the air conditioning that needed repair.  I also replaced the speakers.  I changed the battery once.  Otherwise I have had few complaints except with the transmission.

This is a stick shift car.  From the beginning it was difficult to shift gears without grinding the gears.  I had a number of other people drive the car including a couple of race car drivers.  All reported the same problem.  Even with the clutch pushed to the floor, the gears would, on occasion, grind as if the clutch was not fully engaged.  Acura Service never could replicate the problem, did not believe there was a problem and never repaired it.  To be honest, 106,000 miles later, I have never replaced the clutch or any part of the transmission.  It runs well with this glitch.

There is another glitch that Acura Service could not repair.  If I parked the car needed to put the car in reverse to back it out of a parking space, it was very difficult to put the car in reverse.  Please bear in mind that I am 58 years old, have been driving with a license since I was 15, and have never driven an automatic transmission.  I always buy stick shift cars, so it's not as if I don't know how to drive one correctly.  I had to engage the clutch, move the gears through first, second, third, and fourth, and then maybe it would shift into reverse.  I called Acura, not the Service Department, but the Big Acura In The Sky, so to speak, and here is what they told me:  Release the emergency brake, roll the car forward and then put it in reverse.  But you have to roll the car forward first.  I made them put it in writing, because I couldn't believe my ears.  They refused to repair it, since no repair could be made.  Since then I have always parked the car in a way that allows me to roll it forward a few inches so I can engage the reverse gear and back out of a parking space.  This is not difficult to do, but you have to know that this is what must be done.  Acura Service could never give me this advice.  Clearly they did not know how to manage a manual transmission.

Furthermore, I always had to make an appointment for service.  This is understandable.  They would ask for exactly what I wanted done while the car was in service.  I gave them a list.  Now if I thought of something else, even some tiny thing, they would not address the issue because it was not on the original list.  For instance, I thought one windshield wiper was sluggish.  I forgot to mention it because service was in the middle of summer.  They refused to even evaluate this because it was not on my original list.

Now that I am well out of warranty and have found an excellent mechanic, my repair bills are much smaller and the work gets done without all this silly list making necessity.  I like the car a lot better not having to deal with Acura service.

I will never buy another new Acura again because of the poor service I received from them.  I was used to Honda service, which was so excellent that I bought several Hondas.  When I purchased the Acura, the dealer lied to me and told me that Honda would service my car.  Honda won't touch Acura vehicles. 

Now all that having been said, here is what I love about the vehicle.  The brakes are wonderful.  I have had two flat tires and two experiences where people pulled in front of me on the freeway.  Each time the brakes worked perfectly bringing my car to a safe stop with no handling problems at all.  It was almost as if these situations hadn't happened.  In wet weather, the brakes never let me down.  I have no skidding, no sliding and I feel secure with the anti-lock braking system.

The steering is tight.  Driving the canyons is a real treat.  This car hugs the road.  It has front wheel drive.  I feel like I am driving this car, at one with this car.  There is none of this aim the car type of experience.  The car moves along hairpin turns as if it is on railroad tracks.  

The paint job is still good and the car has never been put in a garage.

The upholstery is in fine condition and it has been badly abused.

After all this time I get 35 mph on the highway and about 24 mph in the city.  Just now I am having to watch the oil because I am either burning a little or there may be a small leak, which I doubt.  I think it is probably just the age of the car.

The trunk holds a lot for a car of this size.  The back seat folds down making it possible to transport long items such as water skis.  

Speaking of the back seat, it's not a comfortable ride back there unless you are a child.  I am 5'2'' tall and I am miserable any time I ride in the back.

As a passenger, the ride is a bit jerky.  It's not all smoothed out like a luxury sedan.  It has a sports car feel and thus you feel all the curves on the road.

As a driver, the driver's seat itself has lower lumbar back support and I find this comfortable.  But there isn't much room for the right leg of the driver.  My husband is very uncomfortable driving this vehicle for any distance.  I, too find that my right leg falls asleep after an hour or so of driving.  

The visibility isn't as good as I would like it to be.  There are some blind spots.  I find that using both side mirrors and a rear view may not be enough to do a lane change in close traffic.  I need to look over my shoulder as well, to be certain that a car isn't in one of the blind spots.

The underside of the car is noisy, so on a road where the paving is not perfect you can hear the road in a way that is disturbing if you are trying to listen to music or to an audiobook.

The stick shift gives this car a lot of get up and go at a dead stop.  I test drove the automatic transmission and there was a big difference.  I always put a couple of people in the car to do a test drive to see how well the car takes off from a dead stop.

On the highway it runs so smoothly that I must be careful not to exceed the speed limit.  There is no noise, rattle, or shimmy to warn me that I might be going over 90 mph.  I don't use cruise control, even though the car is equipped with it and it works.  I have to be vigilant about not speeding on a road trip.  The car 'wants' to go fast.  I want to drive safely.

Seat belts are comfortable for people of several heights.  I am 5'2'' and my husband is over six feet.  We can each make adjustments to feel comfortable with the belts.

The older this car gets, the better I like it.  I expect more from a brand new car.  Now that the car is old and still runs like new, I have little to complain about.

The car is a 1994, but my choices from Epinions force me to say it is a 1995.
