            This is a fantastic SUV for anyone concerned about safety and peace of mind.  The truck is very reliable and solidly built.  I purchased it in April of 1999 (new) and it has not given a single problem mechanically or electrically.  There is lots of room in this car for 5 passengers (six is cramped).  The stereo is easy to program and sounds great.  If you like a HIGH point of visibility,  you will fall in love with this SUV.  You may get tired of stepping UP INTO your car if you are a short person.  We paid $32,000 for this unit after LOTS of research on the INET and it was a very,  very tough car to negotiate down.  Very few dealers where even saying don't waste your time unless you come in with 35,000 BUT do your homework.  The quality is the best feature and of course,  the truck looks GREAT.  You can't go wrong with a Toyota.<br><br>
