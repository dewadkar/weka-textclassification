            We bought a 1996 ford contour last may, only 7 months ago, and i have already put 500 worth of work into it.
the timing belt needed to be done, (yes, regual maintence, but the dealer should have done it for us.)  the fan belt needed replacement also, and a tensioner needed to be done. BOTH cup holders are broken, They are the pop up kind, that if you lean any weight on it, it will break off.   not a good feature.   BOTH front power windows are broken, one the motor died, i have had this fixed TWICE already. It works for a week, then dies.   the other window, the cable actually broke, causing the glass to just fall,   it is currently being held up by duct tape! And the tape player broke.
  Ford had 3 recalls on this car, now thats a bit much, 1 okay, 2 eh.. but 3!!!!!!   get it right the first time, dont put me and my family in danger.
Good things about the car,  its a nice size family car, it gets great gas milage, we drove it to NY from Tx, and back again, it held up good, no problems with either trip.
