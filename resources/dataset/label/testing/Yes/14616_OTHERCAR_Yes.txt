            The S70 is destined to be phased out in the next year or two, in favor of the new, rounded Volvos:  The S/V40, S80, the new V70 and the upcoming replacement for the 70-series, the S60.  I'm glad we bought a Volvo that still looks like a &quot;Swedish Brick.&quot;

The S70 was actually the #2 car on our list of 4 European sedans, but we are infinitely glad we have the car we do, now that we've lived with it for several months.

We purchased an S70 base sedan, with a 5-speed manual transmission, (I think we're one of the 3 people in America who did THAT!) normally-aspirated (e.g.: NON-turbocharged) 2.4-liter 5-cylinder motor, and no options save for a power sunroof.

Even completely base, the Volvo S70 comes with <b>many standard features,</b> like dual-zone heating/air conditioning, a 6-speaker sound system; keyless remote entry; power locks, windows, steering, brakes and mirrors; toolkit w/cotton gloves; 6-way seats for driver and passenger with lumbar support; 60/40 fold-down rear seat; outside temperature readout.  In typical quirky Swedish fashion, the fuel gauge is marked in gallons -- but here's the kicker:  It's proven to be dead-on accurate, unlike the usual 3/4, 1/2, 1/4 gauges you find.

The base engine is quite <b>peppy with the manual transmission,</b> and happy to rev to the 4700 rpm that hold the motor's peak torque.  I had the opportunity to drive the same car with an automatic, and it was decidedly slower to accelerate.  The base 5-cylinder is happy to cruise at <b>75 mph all day long,</b> and returns 29mpg when you do it, as well as a unique &quot;pair and a spare&quot; exhaust note, with harmonics that float around and about the sound.

Handling is better than most Americans, but not as precise as the BMW 323i.  Actual grip is limited by the 15&quot; Michelin MXV4 tires, but steering feedback is excellent, and communicates what the wheels are doing quite well.  Brakes are a strong point, and with <b>4-wheel disc brakes and ABS,</b> this Volvo will stop <i>RIGHT NOW </i>when you want it to.

And the seats.  <b>The seats are possibly the best on the planet.</b>  They simply don't get uncomfortable, and are almost infinitely adjustable to keep your backside happy.  After driving from Indiana to Virginia to Pennsylvania and back to Indiana, I wasn't the slightest bit sore from sitting in the car.  And that's saying something.

<b>===========================UPDATE===========================</b>

It's the end of April, 2000, and we've owned our car for a year.  We've put 20,100 miles on our S70 as of last night.  We've had <b>a nearly problem-free year </b>with our car.  In the first couple of months, the window switch on the front passenger door went south, and was replaced quickly and courteously under warrantee by the dealership.  It hasn't been a problem since.  A month or two ago, a headlight bulb burned out.  We picked up a replacement bulb at Pep Boys for $15, and it took about 45 seconds to open the hood and replace the bulb myself.  Granted, $15 is steep for a bulb that's about the size of a &quot;Good 'N Plenty&quot; sitting on top of a quarter, but they're fiendishly bright.

Our gas mileage is almost exactly what the EPA says the S70 should get...20 city/29 highway.  We've had a number of tanks last over 450 miles in freeway driving, and I'm relatively certain that we could get 500 miles on a tank under the right circumstances.  <b>No squeaks or rattles </b>have shown themselves, and the car still feels like it did when we drove it off the showroom floor last year.  The practicality of the square design shows itself every time we need to carry something in our car.  <b>Four people can ride in comfort,</b> and my witchy step-mother even commented from the back seat on how &quot;smooth&quot; the car rides.  The square trunk holds an enormous amount of cargo, and surprises us every time we think we have too much to carry.  There truly isn't a wasted inch of unusable space in the trunk.

We've had some experience with getting our Volvo's body worked on, unfortunately.  Last September, some vandals walked up our driveway and spray-painted our car, then keyed the driver's door down to the metal.  Three days later, a tornado came through town, and the associated 90mph, gumball-sized hail put about 5,000 dings on the passenger side.  So through no fault of our own, we've had to have a fender replaced and the car repainted.  The nearest Volvo dealer doesn't have a body shop, so we had it done at the local Ford dealer that our insurance company recommended.  Ordering the new fender from Volvo apparently wasn't a problem, but the bodyshop took one look at our &quot;Pewter Silver Metallic&quot; paint and exclaimed &quot;I bet there's 14 pearl coats in THAT color!&quot;  Truly, they told me that in order to blend in the new paint with the old, they had to repaint everything except the trunklid.

Other than that, we've had a trouble-free year, and we are never sorry we got the Volvo S70.

<b>===========================UPDATE.II=========================</b>

It's the end of July, 2000.  We have just over 24,000 miles going as I type this.  More importantly, our first child was born on May 15 -- Gable Shadoff is not only our pride and joy, but he points out some additional features of our Volvo.

<b>If you have a child </b>who needs to ride in a carseat, <b>you will love Volvo.</b>  You will want to kiss the designer of the seatbelt buckle, because it has a <b>locking clip built in.</b>  For the first month and a half, the only car either my wife or I had ever installed a carseat in was our S70, and we never understood the stigma of locking clips.  Then we took our car for its 22,500 checkup and we had a Camry for a loaner.  We wrestled with the back seatbelt in that Toyota for an honest 20 minutes trying to get the locking clip around the belt, and the belt tight enough to immobilize our carseat's base.  It wasn't possible.  No matter what we tried, the seat flopped back and forth.

In our Volvo S70, there is a little red toggle switch in the seatbelt latchplate. (the &quot;male&quot; end)  You click it to &quot;child seat,&quot; you put the belt through the carseat and latch it, you yank on the shoulderbelt.  Presto, the seat is totally immobile.  The whole operation <b>takes 20 seconds.</b>  It is such a good design that I can't even find adequate words of praise.  Every carmaker should include a built-in locking clip in their seatbelts, just as they all use the 3-point harness originally invented by Volvo.

Aside from my affection for the seatbelts, our Volvo lends itself well to carrying our new family addition.  I know, &quot;gee, Volvos are for families?  I never woulda guessed.&quot;  The rear seat has enough room for a rear-facing seatbelt in the center position and my front-facing wife in the outboard position.  With the carseat installed, I don't have to scoot the driver's seat forward very far at all, and I retain adequate legroom for my own rangy frame.  The square <b>trunk will hold two weeks' worth of groceries AND our folded up stroller.</b>  When we went to Minnesota for a wedding, the trunk held a week's worth of luggage for all three of us...AND the same folded up stroller.  No luggage had to intrude into the cabin.

According to their website, Volvo means &quot;I Roll.&quot;  Appropriately enough, we just keep rolling down the road.<br><br>
