            My grandmother gave me her '90 olds to use during the school year, and I must say it still runs pretty well after 168,000 miles. The only things we've had done so far is: new tires (of course), new gas tank, new fuel injectors, and new brake pads. That's it. The machine runs beautifully even now despite the hassle of it being very difficult to change a tail light when it burns out and the digital display is still 100% functional and accurate. The '95 olds is my parents', and honestly has had it's share of problems (though this may not be the norm). We have had to replace the brake pads many times and, though it does run VERY well under every condition and operates very smoothly, the freon didn't last very well, especially since we live up in Wisconsin. The ABS light goes on every time you make a left turn now, and it currently has about 70,000 miles on it last I checked. other than that and the occasional problem, it has run well and really has a good feel to it once you're behind the wheel. The '90 is slightly roomier, especially in the back, but the seats aren't as comfortable.
