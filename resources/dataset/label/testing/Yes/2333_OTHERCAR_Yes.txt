              You can trust me when I say this is the best camera for the money because I don't own it and wish I did.  My best friend bought this one and I decided to pay the extra $300 for the pdrm-70, which turned out to be a waste of the extra cash.  I wish I had just stuck with the m-4 because it's almost exactly the same and it is soooo much cheaper.  
  I've taken about a billion pictures on my friend's m-4, so I think I know a lot about it.  Besides being one of the smallest, most compact cameras out there, it looks really cool!  The sturdy silver camera body is SUPER durable.  I don't think Toshiba advertises this quality, but they should!  Either me or my friend or another of our friends has at least one stepped on this camera, dropped it on cement, thrown it to someone who didn't catch it, and dropped it out the window of a moving car once.  None of these things affected the camera at all (save for a few minor cosmetic scratches on the body).  Even the color display didn't get cracked or hurt or anything!  After two years of beating this camera to death, all that happened was the plastic wheel fell off and we had to glue it back.  
   Toshiba also has excellent customer service for this camera.  They replaced the plastic wheel for us because it was sticking after we glued it on. This was two years after we bought it, and they didn't even charge us!  
   Now for the camera itself: you can adjust so many things on this camera--I can't even go into it all.  But one aspect I really like that it has is the aperture length.  You can take pictures of the moon if you have a tripod, because you can adjust the shutter speed really slow just like a regular 35 mm camera!  We got so many cool shots of the campfire at night and the moon over the lake with this camera.  For regular night time snap shots there is a night time setting, and it doesn't even give red eyes.  I don't know if it has a red eye reduction, but the eyes were never red in the photos.  
   Even though it's rated 2.1 mega pixels, you can't really tell that.  Like I said, I bought the M-70 which is 3.37 mega pixels and you literally cannot tell a difference.  You might be able to if you blew them both up to 11 X 14" photos, but I never wanted my pictures that big.  Mostly I used both cameras for snapshots on trips and stuff like that.  If I were going to blow a picture up, I'd use a regular SLR camera.  
  Anyway, the camera also has an action setting, a portrait setting, an auto setting, a landscape setting, and much more.  
   The only thing it doesn't have is a zoom lens, which can be a problem sometimes.  However, the M-70 does have a zoom lens and the quality of the photo dramatically decreases the more you zoom in, so I'm not sure a zoom lens on a digital camera is even worth it.  For the most part, this M-4 without the zoom worked fine.  
   Toshiba cameras also have the best colors.  They use some sort of special chip to get very realistic and life like colors.  Other digital cameras look very fake to me, but Toshiba's do not.  Most people can't even tell they are digital when they look at my photo albums.  
  This camera is one of the cheaper ones on the market, and I don't know why.  It's much better than other more expensive brands and it is so much better!  After testing out several digital cameras and researching all of them plenty, the M-4 is the best camera.  You won't be disappointed.
