            I bought my Neon 4 Dr Highline in 1999 when it had nearly 40,000 miles on it. On June 9, 2001, it was totaled when someone pulled out directly in front of me and my 3 children and I T-boned her in her passenger side. Both air bags blew and there were no major injuries, thank goodness, and if we had not been in a car as safe as this I am not sure how things would have been different. It was very scary for all of us, especially my 13 year old son who was in the front seat with me, he got a small chemical burn on his forehead and nose from the air bag, but it would have been a lot worse for him without it. Thank you, Plymouth!!!
