            Among all of the popular mid-sized cars today, such as the Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Nissan Maxima, and many others, my 1998 Honda Accord V6 LX Coupe gleams brightly in my eye, as well as others'. What's not to love about sharp lines, 200 horsepower, and great reliability?

<b>Engine</b>
The Accord's V6 V-TEC engine, to say the least, very impressive. This 3.0 liter, 183 cubic inch, 24 valve engine puts out an amazing 200 horsepower. Unfortunately, the V6 only comes in an automatic transmission. The car only weighs 3200 pounds, so be careful driving it at first! It's acceleration is incredibly quick. This is partially due to it's very sleek, aerodynamic body style. It can go from 0-60 in 7 seconds, give or take .3 seconds. Might I add, it is very fun to drive.

<b>Performance</b>
This car's performance is a dream. Handling and steering are quite nice. They aren't too sensitive or too picky either. The ride isn't as smooth as it could be however. If the car had a wider stance, like larger sedans do, the ride would be a bit smoother. The gas mileage is quite good for such a strong car. It gets 21 miles per gallon in city driving, and 29 on the highway. It's gas tank holds 17.1 gallons of gas. The Accord is a pleasantly surprising strong car that is easy to drive.

<b>Features</b>
The EX V6 Coupe comes standard with most every bell and whistle you could want. It has leather, 8-way power adjustment on both driver and passenger seats, dual air-bags, power everything, climate control, CD player with six speakers, remote keyless entry, moonroof and a security system.
The LX V6 Coupe comes standard with most of these nice features, but not the following: Leather seats(option), CD player(option, and it comes with only four speakers), climate control(standard air conditioning comes with it), and the remote keyless entry and security system(which are both options) are the most important lacking features. 

<b>Overall</b>
The 1998 Accord is quite possibly the best car I have ever owned. It is very fun to drive with strong performance and it is stunningly attractive. It is a great reliable car as well. This car was mainly bought because of it's fuel economy with power as well. People who love powerful, good looking cars at a cheaper price would enjoy this car. I honestly don't have any gripes thus far about this car; ok, maybe the price :)<br><br>
