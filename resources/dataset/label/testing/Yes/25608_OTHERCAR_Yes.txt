            This story begins two years ago..........
One Sunday my wife & I were looking for something to do, and so decided to look at some cars. Unfortunately, at one stop I suggested we test drive a SAAB 900 convertible, and the die was cast. My wife fell in love.......
Throughout the next eighteen months the subject came up regularly, but we stuck with the cars we had, then earlier this year we changed one car, and it happened to be the type I wanted. Since then, the SAAB has come up much more frequently, resulting in a cave-in, and purchase, in November.........Now we can continue.

  We are the proud owners of a blue 1999 9-3 convertible. It has the 185hp engine, with leather, and an auto box. It's a high mileage vehicle, in need of a little TLC, but a lot of car for the money.

  The heated leather seats are very supportive and comfortable, adding to the feeling of being part of the car, rather than just occupying it.. 
  If driven with a light foot, the performance is adequate  (and this returns impressive MPG), but click in the "sport" transmission settings, stomp on the loud pedal, and things quickly become electrifying. You can easily be wearing big stupid grins right up until the flashing lights appear in your rearview! Living in Florida I don't feel qualified to speak on the effectiveness of the box's "winter" settings.
  The feedback through the controls, and handling are excellent (as you could expect from a "sport" orientated European car), though torque steer can be present on quick getaways, it easily sensed and controlled through the steering wheel. 
   Control reaction tends to be more gradual than on domestic cars, but this takes little to become familiar with, and leads to the car being less "twitchy".
   The sound system in the car is certainly up to the requirements of average users, but I'm sure afficionados could find fault. Radio reception is at least on par with our our other vehicle, and those of our friends, and the single CD plays CD-R's with no problem. The system pumps out enough volume(when my wife is driving) that the local teenagers expect one of their own to be driving when they pull alongside! 
   Generally fit and finish throughout the car are very good, but some minor controls tend toward the flimsy, in particular the heating/conditioning controls. However nothing in this world is perfect, and I can put that down to a minor character flaw. Believe me, there is no lack of character here, and very few flaws. 
  So far I've made a couple of minor repairs (the brake squeal is gone, the antenna operates smoothly, and a couple of minor pieces have been plastic welded to refit), though our tonneau cover gas strut still requires replacement.
  I'm pleased to say that regular  polishing and waxing  is returning the paint to it's original lustre, and watching a thoroughbred regain it's beauty is reward for the effort.
  Replacement parts are expensive, so shopping around helps (E-bay, pattern parts, breakers, etc). Even though technical help is available through various specialist sites, such as www.saabnet.com, most of it is geared towards the 900, the differences between this and the 9-3 aren't covered so well, so unless you're well versed in maintenance to do things yourself, you could find garage bills being steep.
   This is a car my wife has longed for, and one we are both delighted with. It is not without fault (what truly is?), but is a vehicle I wouldn't hesitate to use for a long journey....as long as there wasn't much luggage. It is, after all, a convertible. 
  I wouldn't describe it as luxurious, but neither does it lack creature comforts. It has style, performance, handling, and is the type of vehicle which could be accepted almost everywhere.

The longer we have this car the more I'll write here. expect an update every six months or so.

Update : 12 May 03
  So we've had the car for six months now, and we've added over 6,000 miles to the odometer. Have our opinions changed?
  In our time with the car it has performed flawlessly. Returning an average of over 20mpg, with performance, style, and fun in abundance.  
  We love this car. It gains admiring looks and comments everywhere we go. When properly cleaned it looks brand new, and worth far more than it cost.
  From formal funerals and weddings, through meetings, to carrying the bikes down to the beach, this car never appears out of place. It is universally accepted and admired.
  Only routine care and maintenance has been required, with one exception........One young lady wanted a closer inspection, and got a little too close, colliding with the rear end while my wife was stopped at a red light. There were no injuries, but the rear bumper unit required complete replacement (to the tune of around $1350). Our Local SAAB dealer did an excellent job of this (though,it took two attempts to correctly match the paint) and we're back to normal.
  The car is laid out to be maintenance friendly, and routine jobs are done quickly and easily. 

 Overall, this has proven so far to be an excellent buy, and one we dont see ourselves parting with for quite some time, so look out for more updates.
