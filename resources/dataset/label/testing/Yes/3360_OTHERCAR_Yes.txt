            The 2001 Nissan Pathfinder is ready to take on its competitors.  Whether they are The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota 4Runner or even the 2001 Toyota Sequoia, Nissan has a better package for the savvy and clever consumers.  A few weeks ago, I ran into a former college classmate of mine.  She was this type who was always picky about men and cars.  They had to appeal to her taste. 

Lo and behold, she was driving a Nissan Pathfinder.  Obviously, my first question to her was whether she found it enjoyable to drive.  A friend of hers and she were sitting comfortably in her bronze-gray Pathfinder.  She invited me to check it out.  Then, two days later, I ran into her friend being stuck in front of a local shopping center.  Her car would not start.  She had called for help.  By the time, my friend arrived, I had already jump started her friend's car.

I had the opportunity to go have some tea with her in her new Pathfinder.  I can tell you that it was a smooth ride. Then, being herself all that time, she proceeded to tell me about the SUV's great performance and how she test-drove all the other import models before deciding on this one.  So, on the way back to retrieve my Jeep, I asked her to drive her truck.  The first thing I noticed was that it was easy to get in and get out.  Its ground clearance is listed as 8.3 in.  As soon as I stepped on the gas pedal, I realized how much of a burst of power this redesigned vehicle had.  I have already reviewed the Montero, 4Runner, and Sequoia.  In my opinion, they can't come near the Pathfinder in terms of power.

<b>Nissan gave lots of power to the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder</b>

With its 3.5 liter V6 engine, the 4WD Pathfinder is designed to provide buyer with great performance on the freeway.  It clearly has a great passing power.  It's queen on any terrain conditions.  If you are thinking about trekking to the most remote areas of the US, Brasil, Venezuela, Asia, the Pathfinder will surely take you to your final destinations.  Just a few weeks earlier, my friend went to Peru and rented a Nissan Pathfinder there.  She told me she had the best of times there.

<b>Four-wheel drive, 5-passenger, 4-door SUV and its features</b>

Depending on whether you choose to drive in town or freeway, just know that you will get 16/10 mpg.  My friend informed me of this.  You will get anything you want on this vehicle.  Choose your options.  I am sure you will like the way leg and head space found in this vehicle.  Actually, it's very comfortable.  The seats on the SUV put you high enough. For sure, I enjoyed the restyled instrument panel.  I think you will too.

*  Shift on the fly that can be engaged at speeds up to 50 miles per hour

*  2 exterior colors:  Burnt cherry and bronzed gray

*  All other standard features

Enjoy your new vehicle!
