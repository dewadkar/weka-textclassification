            The dodge diesel engine is wonderful.  The problem with the dodge lies in the body of the truck.  The truck is not designed to handle such power and in doing so starts to fall apart after use.  I'm disappointed in how fast the truck depreciated.  The truck in 1 yr lost 8000 dollars in value.  After this i could not justify such an expense.  If you don't mind loosing money on an investment, but want a strong truck buy a dodge.  I have one quick story of mine.  In the flood of 98 in Texas I own a RV Park and our river came up too quick to pull out a lot of the vehicles.  I had a 1ton ford dually w/ a 25000 pound trailer stuck in the mud.  My tractor is only rear wheel drive and my tires were only in mud.  I hooked my dodge up to it at my front wheels had a little gravel.  I got on the gas and the truck growled and began to pull the unit out of the mud.  I told the guy with the unit he should have bought a dodge.  This is just an opinion of someone who has owned many different types of trucks and if you can afford to trade in a truck every 2 yrs then maybe buy one.  If not maybe you better find something else.<br><br>
