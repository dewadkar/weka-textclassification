            I purchased a 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan in June of '99, about 7 months or so since this was written, and I have to say I love this car.  Admittedly, it's not the most expensive, or the most luxurious, or the fastest, but it does all the right things well, and that's what's important.

The car is a midsize sedan, about the same size as a Ford Taurus.  It shared platforms with the same-year Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Regal.  The standard engine is a 3.1L V6, making around 160 horsepower at its peak, and mated to a 4-speed electronically-controlled automatic transmission driving the front wheels.  Brakes are four-wheel discs with anti-lock, and the standard tires are 15&quot; in diameter, though 16&quot; low-profile tires with alloy wheels were also available, however my car wasn't equipped with them.
The car I had was equipped with power windows and locks, but no power mirrors.  What's up with that?  Most cars throw all that stuff together in one package.  Quirky.  
As soon as I drove the car, I was tickled pink.  Even with 64,000 miles on the car, throttle response was above-average, and the transmission shifted crisply under power, and smoothly when it wasn't.  For a car of its size, it handles respectably, but there's a bit more body roll than would suit me.  
The first thing to go was the stock AM/FM radio that came with the car. Not that it was a bad unit, in fact it sounded quite good.  But I wanted a CD player, and it wasn't equipped with one.
It hasn't been all roses, though.  This is a big car, and if you're stepping up from acompact, it can be tough to maneuver, especially in parking garages and tight streets.  It also tends to be fairly thirsty. I average slightly less than 20 miles to the gallon.

These are nits to pick though..If you're in the market for a good-quality midsize sedan, this is a great one.<br><br>
