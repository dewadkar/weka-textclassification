            After having no luck with domestic vehicles (either they broke down or were in accidents). I went toward imported vehicles for awhile, 2 car purchases actually. But it just didn't feel right driving a rice-rocket while living in this &quot;great nation&quot; (&lt;--yeah right) America. I sold my little import and went in search for a new, used vehicle a 17 yr. old would like. I saw the '93 LeBaron in a car lot and it just looked like a very promising car.

 The paint had no flaws, the engine was large, a v-6, very quite, and even had AC. The AC is something the imports that I had purchased didn't have. There is so much about this car that I love. It is like a sub-compact luxury car, the interior is very spacious and comfortable, everything is easy to get to, and everything is power--power steering, windows, and doors.

 The only things i don't like about my new car is that it is an automatic and doesn't get the best gas mileage. For some reason i just get bored when driving a car that is an auto. Driving this car is just so amazing, it feels like your cruising over new pavement, even on a really bumpy road.  I recommend this car for anyone that doesn't have alot of money to throw out for a car, and wants a really good deal on a nice car.<br><br>
