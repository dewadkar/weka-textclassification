            I'm a Chevvy man myself, but my dad purchased a new Sebring a couple of years ago.  That was right when I had gotten my license and before I had gotten my car, so naturally I drove it around - I'm not going to complain!

I was surprised to find that it did have a nice feel to it.  For those who don't like being as low to the ground, this offers a rather clear view of your surroundings.  I didn't notice it at first, but in retrospect, now that I drove an '86 Camaro every day, you see a whole lot less of the hood and a whole lot more of the road.  The seat is a bit too high for my liking, but it's still comfortable enough.

Also, for those golf fans out there, be glad to know that there's plenty of space in the car!  The backseat is a little cramped, but it is much roomier than any other sports car I've ridden in.  The trunk is also enormous - big enough to fit a set of golf clubs!

While it's only a V6, the engine has a nice amount of pep to it.  Considering it's not made to be a real sports car, it's definitely worth your money.  I've gotten pretty decent acceleration times, and it doesn't strain the engine all that much to get up to 80 on the highways in a hurry.

Of course, since it isn't a real sports car, the engine noise has been toned down a _lot_.  Your average car user may like it, but I miss the sound of a nice, purring engine whenever you start a decent acceleration.  I sometimes don't even realize when I get 20 or 30 mph over the speed limit - the engine and road noise is so reduced that the only indicator is the other cars and the spedometer.

I haven't had any real problems with the car.  The convertible top is still in great shape two years later, all of the power features work fine, and the CD player is nice (though it only holds a single CD).  The paint job is in great shape, and it hasn't needed anything done besides regular maintenance.

However, the car itself could use a bit of work.  I'm used to handling curves in my Camaro, and the feel is _completely_ different.  The steering wheel is way too loose and I often find myself slamming it as far as it goes because there's no resistance.  Likewise, the accelerator is ridiculously sensitive - your foot gets awfully tired if you don't like constantly flooring it.  This can also lead to a nasty habit of excessive speeding if you're not careful.  I have tried a few times, but I just can't get the same response around curves that I get in my car.

Like I said, though, this is not a sports car.  If you're looking to race, or just to get a thrill out of driving, this probably isn't the car for you.  Buy a real car - a Chevvy.  But if you're an average driver, looking for something that looks sporty and feels pretty much the same, you'll be more than satisfied.
