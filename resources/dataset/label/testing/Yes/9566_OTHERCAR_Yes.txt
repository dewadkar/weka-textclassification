            A recent college grad, I was out with my father looking for my first new car.  There were the standards: Civic, VW Jetta, Integra...  But when I saw the 2000 Celica sitting in the dealer's lot, I knew there was no chance of getting any other car.  I'll admit that I was totally attracted to the car because of the looks of the machine.  The inside was just as stylized as the outside.  But when I drove the car, I was surprised at how well it drove.  You can turn quickly, stop on a dime, and (on the automatic) very little detection of the automatic shifting.  While it was a GT model and the acceleration could leave a little to desire, for a base price of $16K, I wasn't going to get picky.

Now that I've had my Spectra Blue GT for three months, I think it was a great buy.  Everyone likes the looks, and I get a lot of &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhs&quot; from my friends.  There are some drawbacks - limited rear visibility, cramped backseat and low-riding seats, but those are all practically definitions for a &quot;sporty&quot; car.  I would like to question the unlit vanity mirrors and the annoying double-beep of the remote keyless entry, but I'm not going to get too bent out of shape because of it.

What it DOES have is outstanding extras - fit and finish, EXCELLENT gas milege, comfortable seats, standard CD &amp; cassette player, a pretty decent trunk, automatic lights, two great cubby holes (one on the middle of the dash and one center console) and four cupholders.  I especially enjoy Toyota's placement of the power window and door lock controls between the driver and passenger.  It took a little while to get used to it, but now it's thoroughly enjoyable.  I drove 90 mph from Chicago to Memphis and was loving every second of it.  Wind resistance is practically non-existent with the aerodynamic shape, and the car felt solid along with all the semis.

If you are looking for a great-value, hot-looking car with creature comforts and a great ride, you can't go wrong with the 2000 Celica.  If you need a hotrod that goes 0-60 in 5 seconds, you better look elsewhere.  This car is a cruiser that performs well at low and high speeds, but everyone will admit that any car with only 140hp is not going to win many races.  My brother has a '98 Integra and he's jealous of the Celica.  He thinks that the Celica just has a higher level of quality than you would expect from the price.<br><br>
