            After owning a Chevrolet S-10 of 3 years, I decided to look into getting a new car, I looked around at Pontiac's and Geo's and then I ran into my Cavalier.  It was how do you say, Love at first sight, a nice looking little red car with sporty aluminum rims, and a Sunroof, all tied into one nice little package. I am a volunteer Fire fighter and I needed room to haul my TURNOUT gear, and I found with the huge trunk I could fit everything I needed and then some. And when I climbed into the Drivers side I was amazed at the moldings of the dash and the feel of the steering wheel, as well as the tachometer and all the little gadgets...As I went down the road I was astonished at the acceleration of a 4 cyln. 115 hp 3 speed auto. I found that this little car could keep up with the big boys..Also it has a excellent Factory Stereo, I found that with just a little tweaking of the Bass and Treble, and a little fade to the back set of speakers, that they were &quot;kickin&quot; like the big boys.  Also with these cars you can very easily take a plain &quot;CAV&quot; and dress it up to make a super sleek street machine, with just a little stripe and door moldings, and a coat of wax, and this baby turns some heads. Bottom Line for the money Chevroletï¿½s Cavalier can't be beat, IT RUNS QUICK, IT TURNS HEADS, AND MOST OF ALL ITS CHEAP AND CHEAP OPERATED!!!!!<br><br>
