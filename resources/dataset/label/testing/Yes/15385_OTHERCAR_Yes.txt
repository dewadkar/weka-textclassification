            We recently purchased one of these cameras for our business for the purpose of taking pictures for a web site.  Before buying, we also looked at the FD-73 as well, but decided on the FD-83.  

They two are basically the same, with the the FD-83 adding the capability of recording video (mpg format) files.  

While the quality of the still pictures is great, the video is less than satisfying.  Of course you don't expect camcorder quality out of this unit, but even at that, the quality is not very good.  However, taking stills is a breeze.  The camera literally guides you through the process of choosing the proper settings.  Then it's just point and shoot.

And, the ability store the photos on a diskette is the best feature.  For starters it provides you with unlimited storage capacity.  When you fill up a disk just pop it out and put in a fresh one.  Diskettes are cheap and easily had, unlike some of the other methods use by digital camera manufacturers.  And, they can be used in either PC or Mac format.  Another big plus.

All in all, I would recommend this camera to anyone.  But I would also advise you look at the FD-73.  It does not have the video capability, but, as I've said above it's not a great feature.
