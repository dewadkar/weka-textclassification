            Mercedes ML 320 starting around $34,000 could be considered a good investment in more ways than one.  In todays competitive market for SUV's we find that many are close in the pricing. Performance and quality are a different altogether.

Positive points for the ML230 are one fair pricing considering the overall market. Safety is a definite plus for this vehicle. Performs well in any weather. Not top heavy as many SUV'S tend to be. Much better trade in allowance or resale value than any other SUV. 

Negative aspect being that optional features can boost vehicle price to as much as $64,000, yet the same is not available on alternative style vehicles. Not the best performer on fuel consumption in the city but tends to do fairly well on the highway.  

Great family vehicle or for the frequent traveler. Mercedes is without a doubt one of the most durable vehicles ever made. Just remember to have your bank account well funded in the event of an accident as insurance is extremly high as well as general repairs. Parts are outrageous. 

Colorado as many other states have increased insurance premiums on SUV'S due to statistics. On the other hand if you look at the overall odds would you not rather invest 35K into a Diamond than a cubic zirconia?

Drive a Mercedes ML 230 you will be ultimately surprised.<br><br>
