            <b>Introduction</b>

Having driven this car for two months and 3,000 miles now, in winter and summer driving, I have concluded that I am very happy with my purchase. The Metro is cheap to drive, and not at cramped or wimpy as I thought it would be. For the money, it's a terrific around-the-towner and even occasional road-tripper.

<b>The Specifics on my vehicle</b>

I purchased this car used, as a former rental with 41,000 miles on it. (I felt comfortable buying a rental Metro, because who rents a Metro to go hot rodding?) It is a 2000 Chevy Metro LSi Hatchback (book value about $5,000). The LSi includes air conditioning, a three speed automatic transmission, and a rear-window defroster. The car has standard daytime running lights and passenger and driver side airbags, but since anti-lock brakes are optional, I don't have them. My car also has manual steering, a point I will come back to later.

<b>The Fit</b>

The first thing people say when I mention my Metro is how <i>tiny</i> it is. My car, in fact, seems to be the proverbial clown car. It fits me and my six-foot boyfriend comfortably, and there is plenty of room for the dog and all our toys in the back seat. I have comfortably fit four people in my car. The only pain is that my car has just two small doors, rather than the longer doors usually found on coupes, so getting in and out is a little acrobatic. I would not recommend this car to a family of more than two people for that reason.

Ergonomically, I like the way the Metro is laid out. There are very few extra buttons (like heated seats - I wish) so it is very easy to find what I'm looking for. Heat is on the dash, wipers on the column, pretty basic. The horn consists of two buttons on the face of the steering wheel. I noticed that other reviewers didn't like that feature, but I do. It took me a week or two to get used to them (I kept hitting them by accident), but with the buttons there, it is easier to give a 'little honk' (i.e. when the light is green and the person in front is not paying attention). Because I drive with my hands at 10 o'clock/2 o'clock (my cousin is a driver's ed instructor; I have to set a good example) I never have trouble finding them when I need them.

Because this sort of falls into ergonomics, I will mention the radio here. AM/FM radio is not standard on Metros, although mine came with one. The reception is really horrible. When I drove by mail boxes, the radio would cut out. An aftermarket radio/CD player seems to have fixed this problem, leading me to conclude that the factory AM/FM radio may be sorely lacking.

One of my biggest requirement in a car when I was test-driving was that when I drove I didn't have to turn up the radio while driving, and turn it down at stop lights to compensate for the engine noise. The noise level in my Metro is constant while driving around town and when stopped at lights. This please me a lot. It's not quiet, I should disclaim, just constant.

<b>How Does It Drive?</b>

My Metro is no slouch.

I used to drive a 4x4 pick-up, and the Metro offers a considerably different driving experience. First, regarding the size issue... it ain't that bad. I'm lower to the ground than in the pick-up, so sometimes it's hard to see around Stupid Utility Vehicles, but when I drive my mother's Camry I notice the same thing. So that's not such a big deal.

Speed-wise, the fourth cylinder in my Metro gives it 79 hp, which seems like plenty of pep. It's not a lot of horsies, but they're not pulling that much weight either, so it works out all right.

My biggest complaint with the car stems from the drive train, though, and it is that the car has a lousy three-speed automatic transmission. The car drives fine until about 55 mph, then it sounds like it <i>really</i> would like to shift again. Alas! no fourth gear. This also compromises the car's fuel efficiency. I find I get optimal highway mpg at 50 mph, about 40 mpg. Of course, at that speed, everybody's flicking their headlights at you, but I don't mind. There's a whole club of Subaru Justy's and Ford Festivas who drive 50 mph, and we're good company. Around the town, the Metro is not as efficient as I had hoped... with the three-speed automatic I get between 24 and 26 mpg. This isn't a problem with the specific vehicle, it's typical for auto Metros. The standard, I'm told, gets nearly twice that. It's a shame Chevy cheaped out on the trannys.

I live in Maine, and what which a $10M budget shortfall in Portland, they stopped plowing the streets on March 1. This didn't seem to bother the Metro - it handles the snow as well as any front-wheel drive car. (Mine is equipped with All-Season tires).

Power steering is an option on Metros, so I don't have it. At first, I thought something was wrong with the car. Again, though, after a week, I was used to it. The trick to power steering, I discovered, is just to let the car move a bit whilst I steer. I parallel park with ease (although part of that is the car is so small). I don't miss the power steering, in short.

<b>Things the car does not have</b>

I am including this section because I was surprised that there wasn't a latch under the seat for the trunk. May you not be surprised.

This car does not have:
A trunk latch under the driver's seat
Mirrors adjustable from the inside
Power steering (it's an option)
Anti-lock brakes (it's an option)
More than one intermittent speed on the windshield wipers
A tachometer
A center console between the front seats.

It's an inexpensive car, though, so what do you expect?

<b>In conclusion</b>
I really like my car. It's simple and straight-forward, and though not that 'fun' or 'fancy', it fit my budget and for what I paid, I feel I got a nice little set of wheels.
