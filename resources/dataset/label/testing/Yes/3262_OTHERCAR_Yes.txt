            So you're pondering a used Q45?  Be my guest!  The Infiniti Q45 is the best kept secret on the road.  I say secret because I still have people look at me funny when I tell them I drive a Q.  For some reason (my guess is poor marketing) only Lexus and Mercedes come quickly to mind when you think luxury brand.  

It's hard to believe that my 1990 is a decade old.  The get-up-and-go is stunning.  I can sum it up in two words:  effortless thrust.  All 282 horses jump at the gate everytime I leave a red light.

The interior is amazing.  So much leather.  Leather everywhere.  The dash, the doors, the seats...yummy!  And speaking of the seats, comfort abounds.  They're firm yet forgiving.  The leather is smooth and sturdy.  You feel surrounded by elegance at every turn.  All of the controls are easy to reach for driver and passenger.

The Bose stereo system is an added bonus.  Though not as powerful as the versions in new Infinitis, it sure does beat the old Delcos in Fords and Chevys of the same year!  There was a recall on some of the early Q45 speaker systems, but hopefully the one you are about to buy will have been fixed.  Make sure you ask about it!  Transmissions were also recalled on the 1990 version.  Mine had been replaced, so I didn't worry about it.  Every Q45 I test drove had a new transmission.

Another thing I have noticed about Q45's in general is the incredible paint.  Mine is Pearle and looks like it came out of the showroom yesterday.  I always look at Infiniti's in parking lots and am continually impressed.  The paint just doesn't seem to age.  An added bonus.  

Roomy trunk, decent back seat, low road noise, smooth handling, graceful looks.  I cannot say enough about the Infiniti Q45.  If you compare prices on 1990 Q's and LS400's, there's no mistaking it...the Q wins hands down.  You get every luxury for thousands less.  I guess the fact that Infiniti is the &quot;unknown&quot; luxury brand works in the consumer's favor.  I highly recommend a used Q45.  Several of my friends have purchased them since I bought mine two years ago.  No complaints yet.  If you like to speed through traffic like a demon and pass everyone on the highway with little effort at all and you happen to be a little on the thrifty side, the Q's for you!<br><br>
