            My mom has owned the Lexus ES300 since October of 1991, when it was a brand new model replacing the ES250. In fact, I helped her shop for that car as she wanted a new car for under $30,000 ($30,000 is where the luxury tax kicks in). The salespeople at the dealership were excellent, not pressuring us at all. I suppose their job was easy as the ES300 pretty much sells itself. After more than 8 years, my mom still has the car, still running fine. I still get to drive it occasionally. If you are looking to buy a secondhand ES300, then I hope this Epinion will help you decide.

<b>Options</b>
Her ES300 came with cloth interior, AM/FM/cassette sound, and sun/moon roof. Other than these options, it is pretty much the same as others. The cloth interior is still in excellent condition, with slight discoloration but no rips or tears. The sound system uses a dial for volume, which I prefer over buttons. The roof turns into a moonroof when you slide a panel manually. The roof tilts open with one button, and slides open with another button. It still works fine. 

<b>Powertrain</b>
The V-6 engine, which outputs about 180hp is super-smooth as you'd expect a Toyota engine to be. I've driven the car through the hills of San Francisco, merged into freeways almost from a standstill, and always felt I had more than enough power. The electronically-controlled 4 speed automatic transmission's smoothness goes well with the engine - in fact, I can't even feel it shift from 3rd to 4th (Overdrive) unless I look at the tachometer and observe the changes in rpm.

<i>The engine revs at ~3000rpm at 70 mph with Overdrive, so the gear ratio is short compared to most American cars. This makes the ES300 feel quick.</i>

<b>Suspension &amp; Steering</b>
As with any luxury car, the ES300 isolates road bumpiness very well, but not to the point of making the car &quot;wallow.&quot; The steering effort is fairly light, but it doesn't feel loose. I suspect the car has significant positive caster, making the front wheels want to straighten out. The ES300 feels very solid, but not to the point of being too sporty.

<b>Interior Noise</b>
The most impressive thing about the ES300, in my opinion is the interior noise, or the lack of it. The differences in noise compared to driving the car with the windows open and closed is so significant that I still find it hard to believe. Fortunately, I almost never have to drive with the window open as the climate control system works pretty well. I don't need to raise my voice when I converse in the car, but I do have to turn up the volume a little when I listen to music while on the freeway.

<b>Problems</b>
I wish I can say that the ES300 is perfect, but it's not. The driver side rear door window jams now and then. The solenoid that keeps the shifter in &quot;Park&quot; (it's there so you can't shift unless your foot's on the brake) has jammed at least twice, forcing my mom to use the shift lock override button - the solenoid has been replaced. The instrument panel digits are lighted, and they are hard to see during sunrise and sunset especially if the sun is behind you, shining directly at the gauges. It's even worse during dusk as the gauges automatically dim when you turn the headlights on.

<b>Summary</b>
Overall, however, the ES300 has been rock solid reliable, comfortable, and enjoyable. Mechanically, the car has had no problems so far, and most of its problems have been electrical. Even after 8 years, the car still feels solid, eager for at least another 8 years.
