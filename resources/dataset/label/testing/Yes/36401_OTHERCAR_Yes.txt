            I couldn't believe I was about to buy my 2nd Dakota after getting rid of my 2000 model in only 6,000 miles- but I'm so glad I did!! Here's the story...

Though never a "Chrysler Man" I was seduced by Dakota's new styling and the "mid-sized" package that promised better mileage, lower cost but without a small truck ride! I fell hard for a 1999 yellow regular cab Sport- V6 with 5-spd. The truck literally "Skipped" and "Hopped" sideways when passing over road irregularities in a curve- a VERY disturbing driving characteristic! And the mileage was abysmal- 13-15 mpg for a V6 5-spd!! After only 6,000 miles I sold it and was glad to be rid of it.

But the urge for a pick-up struck again 2 years later. I shopped the full-sized Fords, Chevys and Dodges and concluded they were more truck than my needs or my budget could justify. I shopped the compact Toyotas, Nissans, Rangers and S-10s and concluded all were too small and unpleasant in the comfort department. Once again I found myself face-to-face with a Dakota! 

I test-drove an extended cab 4.7 V8 automatic. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! The ride was much better- though the "skip" and "hop" are still noticable- but reduced by about 70% compared to the regular cab. The performance was VERY impressive compared to the anemic V6- and the mileage promised to be better. 

I can now say that the mileage *IS* better- 15-16 mpg in town, 19-21 mpg hwy. I still don't understand how a bigger truck with a V8 and an automatic can get up to 50% better mileage than the smaller truck with V6 and 5-spd... but it does!!!

The cab comfort is great- comfortable seats, plenty of leg-room and head-room... and with the extended cab, the ability to "recline" the seats for comfort that was sorely missing in the "upright-only" driving position of the regular cab.

The build-quality so far is superb- no rattles, squeaks, wind-whistles or mechanical problems and good body fit and finish. It doesn't get any better than this.

If you don't need the slightly larger capacity of a full-sized truck but you still want a roomy cab with a comfortable ride- Dakota is a great choice. 

I've owned a Toyota Tundra (great performance- uncomfortable seats), a Toyota Tacoma (as reliable as a brick but HORRIBLE ride/comfort!!) and now two Dakotas. So far- this is by far the best all-around compromise of comfort, features and price. I also own a 2000 Chevy Suburban (versatile, comfortable and EXPENSIVE!) and a 1998 Jeep Wrangler (FUN! FUN! FUN!). But my day-in and day-out choice is the Dakota.

Avoid the V6 (and the 5.9L from what I've heard about gas mileage) and investigate the 4.7L. You'll also be glad you chose the extended cab option as well.
