            UPDATE!!  I have now had this vehicle for a month now, and I have to say that I am not disappointed at all with the performance.  

At one point we had to take take it back to the dealer because the headlight went out.  Well, if the dealer didn't cover the cost it would have been $172 out of pocket to fix the headlight.  It's not a simple fix to change the headlight bulb, and you have to take the car in to get it replaced.

As for the gas milieage, I will go about 210 miles before having to fill the gas tank.  It's not bad gas mileage but my Maxima can go 2 weeks without a fill-up with regular driving, while I'm filling the Quest every week with the same amount of usage as I have with the Maxima.

The highway driving is smooth.  Not a rough drive at all, as some cars I've driven.  It's very smooth, and the shifting is not as smooth as I'm used to with a stick, but it's not a rough transmission.  The brakes seem very good, but I do use caution since it is a larger vehicle than I am used to.  Highway driving is fast and smooth also.  I can pass another car with no problem of not having pick up and go.  In fact, the speed sometimes gets away from me if I'm not careful.

Overall, since purchasing this vehicle I am very happy with it.  The kids love it, and I feel special when I'm driving it!

[End of Update]

I thought that I would never say that.  Soccer moms, SAHMs, etc.  I thought I would never join the ranks!  But guess what?  The day after Christmas we bought a 2000 Nissan Quest black on Silver used.  Of course my husband says that it is mine, because he wouldn't be caught dead driving a jellybean schoolbus!!

Originally, we've only been looking at minivans, not real serious about buying one, we looked at Chrysler Town and Country's, Toyota Sienna's, Dodge Caravans and Grand Caravans, and we even test drove a Honda Odyssey.  But when we got behind the wheel of the Quest, we were sold!!  It drove like a car, smooth and quiet (some bumpiness on bumpier roads), handled beautifully, and had some pick up.  The gas pedal was easy, and the brakes smooth.

The model that we got, the SE, must have come with the options packages.  We received the CD/6 CD changer, AM/FM Cassette, TV/VCR combo with game hookup, rear A/C, memory driver seat (which is wonderful, since my husband always complains when I've been driving the car), conversation mirror, pilot seats in the middle, bench seat in the back, with the optional shelf, luggage carrier on top, and sunroof.

I love the two sliding doors on either side, and the power seats.  It's roomy, though I have to admit, once you get two car seats in there, it's a little harder getting to the back of the van.  The one seat that folds forward for easy access to the back, has a car seat on it, hence limiting it to squeezing past the front to get to the back.

The back bench seat folds down to give you more storage space, and the TV/VCR combo keeps the kids quiet, even when your only going up to the store and back!!

There are lots of cup holders, and alot of storage, but the cup holders that are available for the driver and passenger leaves little to be desired.  They are not enclosed, you only have a small band of plastic to go around your cup, and you have to push the band to resize.  This morning, I was driving into work, and BUMP! My coffee cup went flying and landed on the floor, all over!  So, I decided right there and then, that we have to go buy some alternate method cup holders for the front.

Another nice feature is the back window.  You have to choice of opening the window, or the whole door.  If you insert the key and unlock just the window portion, the rear wiper, moves down for easy access, when closed the wiper moves back into place.  Also, it has automatic headlights, good for those who forget to turn the headlights on when you need to.

All in all, since I have only had the car for maybe 3 days, I really like the 2000 Nissan Quest, and think that we have made a very good choice.
