            I am so proud to be an owner of a 1999 Toyota 4-Runner.  It's big, it's powerful, and it's beautiful.  There's no feeling like sitting in this SUV, so high off the road! (I drove a Prelude before, which made it feel like I was driving 2 inches from the ground). 

I bought my Purple 4-Runner in November, 1998.  I've had this baby for over a year now and have put almost 15,000 miles on it.  This is by FAR the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Besides oil changes and regular maintenance, this car has needed no work.  This car has never had a problem.  TROUBLE-FREE!  I love it!

I still get compliments from co-workers and relatives about my 4-Runner.  It still looks as good as the day I bought it, with the exception of lots of dog hair in the back from my Siberian Huskies (but that's not the 4-Runner's fault!).  I can't imagine driving anything else, and I plan to keep my 4-Runner for many, many years.  It's been great to take on camping trips, on ski trips, and on long-distance driving trips.  With the cargo net in the back, it's even great for trips to the grocery store!

My only wish for the 4-Runner is that it had more electronic goodies on the dash board, like the inside/outside temperature, how many gallons of gas is left in the tank (or mileage left before refill), etc.  I guess that's why Toyota made the Land Cruiser!<br><br>
