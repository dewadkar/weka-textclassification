               I've owned three Ford Escorts... an 82 wagon, an 84 hatchback, and an 88 model.

   Drove all three of them into the ground... Through deserts, up mountains, rain, snow, ice, everything... Even took the 82 on a trip to Germany with me... Yes, it survived the autobahn... In fact, it handled the speed hour better than I did!

   Each one I've used and abused. Was late on tune-ups if I did them at all, late changing the oil... What's an air filter? And each one did treated me the same.

   Only one time out of all the trips of all three Escorts did one ever leave me stranded. (I ran out of gas)  Broken, overheated, whatever, they always got me home.

   Each one I ever owned made it to 150,000 miles at the very least. (The first one I owned as a 17 year old... It got to a quarter million miles, then one day I pulled it up to the house, made a sound I'd never heard a car make before or since, and the transmission (among other things) came outta the bottom in nice little bite size pieces... but it got me home.

   What do I think of this car? I think it's time for me to buy another one as my Nissan pickup truck died after 20,000 miles...<br><br>
