            For the past few years we have been a two Explorer family, at one point owning 1998, and 1999 Ford Explorer XLT vehicles, both 4 wheel drives. We were looking for a change for the 1998 model, but it was hard to break away from our love of Explorers. 
Out of the blue we drove to the local dealer and saw two Explorer Sport Tracs sitting on the lot. One already had a sold sign in it. The dealership was closed, so we peeked inside the vehicles, and were clearly impressed by what we saw. This was definitely different, but still was definitely an Explorer. The next morning, we were at the dealership taking a test ride. We test drove a gold, two wheel drive model. My husband was instantly in love, but I wasn't sure it was what I wanted. I wasn't sure I liked the way it drove, but he said it was because I was used to always driving 4 wheel drives. The gold vehicle had cloth seats, which I immediately thought &quot;how will we keep these clean with kids&quot;! We thought about it back and forth a few days. 
While out one day I saw the red vehicle no longer had a &quot;sold&quot; sign in the window. I called my husband and we ended up at the dealership again, this time test driving a Toreador Red 4 x 4 Sport Trac. We could clearly feel the difference in handling between the two vehicles and we both knew we wanted to own this one. I don't know if this is the case for all Sport Tracs, but between the 2 wheel and 4 wheel drives that we drove, another difference was the front console. The two wheel had a removable soft pack case, where the 4 wheel drive had a hard molded console which resembles our Explorer XLT models. I preferred the hard console. One of the options in this vehicle was gray leather bucket seats (something I never experienced before) and they are wonderful. Easy to keep clean, quite comfy and very stylish. 
We bought the vehicle in March of 2000, and being one of the first on the road, we got many stares, and questions, but most people loved the styling and were really impressed. Due to the fact that we had a mild winter, I only experienced one significant snow fall, but the vehicle handled well. My only problem in the extreme cold is there is no rear window defogger, so you have to rely on the rear passenger heater to clear up the window. Also when it rains, or when the vehicle is wet after a rain fall you cannot lower the power back window or you'll get the back seat/rear passengers drenched, even if only vented. I am waiting for the rear window rain guards to come out to buy and then that problem will be solved. Being so new, a lot of the optional add ons are not available yet.  My son is 5' 9&quot; and feels just as comfy in the back seat of this vehicle as he does in the 99 Explorer XLT. I don't notice any less space myself, and I feel the head rests are more comfy than our XLT in the front and the back. 
The only difference between this and our XLT Explorer is handling wise, this is definitely a smoother ride. I ecspecially notice on the turns, and so does my daughter who rides mainly in the back seat. For now we have the soft cover for the back bed which is sufficient for our needs, in the future we may consider the hard cover. For being only a V6, this vehicle is very peppy, you certainly do need to check out the speedometer as the smoothness of the ride makes you feel like you are going slower than you really are. We get about 17 mpg. city driving, about 20 highway. 
If you are looking for something different, or for you Explorer owners, something kind of the same, you may want to consider this vehicle. <br><br>
