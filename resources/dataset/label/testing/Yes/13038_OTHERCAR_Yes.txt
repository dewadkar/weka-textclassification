            My parents bought me a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190 turbo. We've always compared it to my brothers which is the same but it's from 1985 and has no turbo. We have been very satisfied with the results of both cars, but the power of the 1990 is much greater then that of the 1985. Most likely it is due to the turbo, but the comfort is also a wonderful plus. The leather interior is only now starting to get a little wear and has been through alot. These cars can last a lifetime and the they never let you down. Be sure to take care of them, and you should have no problem.<br><br>
