            I received my 94 v6 camaro as a gift my junior year in high school.  We got a good deal on a used one back in late 96.  I just traded it in a couple months ago.  It was always a great car.  I had several wrecks in it, but it always drove away.  I was airborne once for over 30 feet after an unfortunate incent with a ditch.  And I blew out all four tires, but I drove it home!!  It took several other hard hits and the only damage that I had was body work.  It was a great car the whole time I had it.

The seats are very comfortable, but if you like a lot of width as far as leg room goes you're going to be out of luck.  I'm 6'2&quot; and got used to it, other than that it was very comfortable.  

Performance wise it was a great little v6.  It simply out performed it's main competition, being Mustangs, hands down.  I had a few run ins on the street with Mustangs and I always came out ahead of the v6 breed.

You cannot see the hood of these cars while driving, but is nothing once you get used to it.  It handled very well and was the easest car to park that I've ever had.  It took curves very well and that is something that I will miss.  It being a sports car of course does not have much room in way of cargo, but that was to be expected.

One thing I can recommend is to get at least a 95 so you get the 3.8 v6 instead of the 3.4 liter.  The numbers as far as I know are 3.4  170 horsepower 200 pds. torque.   The 3.8 puts out  200 hp  and 220? pds of torque.  I had personally with my standard transmission and flowmaster exhaust was able to get a low 16 in the quarter mile.  Not too bad as far as I'm concerned.  

I fun car with no problems except for the fact that you tend to scrape the underside of the front on inclines.<br><br>
