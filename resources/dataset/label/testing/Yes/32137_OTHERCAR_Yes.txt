                As a third year college student, I didn't have a big savings put away for a new car, so when my last car died, I thought I would have to settle for yet another used car.  Boy was I skeptical when I saw an ad in the paper for a new, year 2000 car for less than $9,000.  

    I went to the dealership and was struck by how attractive the Lanos was. I imeadietly fell in love with the two door hatchback model.  The test drive only reinforced this.  I decided that ideally I would have a blue or silver automatic with air conditioning.  The salespeople said they would have a blue one in a week so I reserved it and waited.

    After taxes and all the other fees, my end price was a little over $10,000.  This wasn't the too far off from what I read in the paper and I now have an affordable $187 a month payment.  The car comes with a great warranty and roadside assistance program.  I've had it for eight months now and the performance has only improved with use.  Another plus is that everyone on the road looks at you and plenty of people compliment the car.

    The only complaint that I could possibly have is that when the air conditioning is on, the car looses a lot of power.  However I'm told that this occurs in any 4 cylinder.
