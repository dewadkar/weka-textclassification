            Hey all, i recently acquired this camera, and all i have to say is &quot; Dang, what a nice Camera!&quot; Actually, i could say much, much more, but this site doesn't like profanity. :(   After only a few trial shots, i was deeply in love. Using the smart media data cards, ;you can now take and store way more pictures than the old fashioned 3.5' floppy, which was still big back when i started using digital cameras. The power shot s10 features an extremely good resolution for the preview screen, which is rare. It's zoom is extremely good, better than most digitals ive used yet. It's also rugged, and weather tight. It got knocked around pretty badly in my car a few days ago, and it still works perfectly. I used it in a light misty fog one day, it was still perfectly dry despite the condensation on the outside. All in all, a good camera for even the most beginning user. The only drawback is that it uses up it's battery power like a junky with a kilo. but it's easy to recharge, and radio shack sells replacement batteries. Yoda Says &quot; Good camera is this, yes... <br><br>
