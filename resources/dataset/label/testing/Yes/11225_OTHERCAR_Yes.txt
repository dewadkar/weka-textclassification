            We bought this van about 3 years ago thinking that it would be a great vehicle.  All we got was a big sour lemon.  We had more problems than not with it.  Everything from having to buy a new transmision to a broken window moulding.  It seems like as soon as we get something fixed, something else breaks for stops or messes up.  The body of this van is made from a plastic polymer, which is durable and will not break or crack like fiberglass, but it dents very easily.  Just about the only thing that we were impressed with was the sound system, probably because it has nothing to do with Chrystler.  It is an Infinite suround sound system.  It is an 8 speaker system with a CD/cassette head unit.  I have probably maxed out the handeling but it still plays 100%.  I would not recommend this car to anyone unless they like being in the shop at least once a month or can fix cars themselves.<br><br>
