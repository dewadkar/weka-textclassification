            I wrote my last opinion when I just got the car, here is a revised one.  It is 126,00 and still going, and I have also done some research on the car as well, and here is my experience and all the info I have found.

First of all, this car is the sister car of the Eclipse and the Talon.  If you have seen all three cars, you will see that basically the only difference is the names on the back.

The Laser Turbo RS is a 3 door hatch back, 2.0 Dual Overhead Cam turbo-charged engine, 5 speed standard transmission, 4 wheel independent suspension with 4 wheel disk brakes, and all powered accessories.  I have had brand new cars that don't have automatic windows, mirrors and locks.  The sound system is great too with the equalizers to set your preferences.  It also has a cassette player, a million lights on the dash that I not yet know what they are for.  There is only one I know and that is the coolant light.  It looks like a little carousel and is orange.  It will not come on until you are COMPLETELY out of coolant.  The other lights, I can't figure those out, I just know there is a lot of them.  Hopefully none of us have to find out because normally lights on the dash are bad.

The car takes 17&quot; wheels which is a little bit expensive.  This is a sports car and you are looking at more than $100.00 per tire, at least where I am you would be.

When I first got the car, I was doing some reading on it, and noticed that a lot of people who own this car still have it at like 260,000 miles and still running.  I think that is excellent.  The car accellerates from 0-60 in 6.9 seconds and 1/4 mile in 15.4.  Excellent accelleration there too.  I don't think I can shift that fast though.  That brings me to gas mileage too.  Gas mileage is okay.  I get about 28 miles per gallon.  Super or Premium gasoline is what you want to use though.  I found an auto mechanic who said that is what needs to be put in that car.

With my car, I have a problem with it burning oil and I have an oil leak.  I have to frequently add oil to it about once a week.  In the research I have done on this car, I haven't seen anyone say they have had an oil leak, but since I have one and it is burning oil, there could be a possibility.  Also, with 16 valves, you want to keep an eye on the timing belt because if that breaks, it is goodbye to all of your valves, they all will bend.  It hasn't happened to me, but it is almost time to get a new one.

I recommend this car to those who love speed, power, an awesome looking car, and safety.  My insurance is cheap on this car.  Another thing is if you like roomy, forget it, don't buy it.  The console is right under your arm while you are shifting and the cup holders are in the console.  DUH!! Can't get to them.  Also, the passenger has a tendency to bump you, there is hardly any back seat room at all.  This is a small car, so if you are going to be hauling around several people at once, I do not recommend this car.  4 people in that car is an awful task.  Comfort wise for one of two people though is fine.
