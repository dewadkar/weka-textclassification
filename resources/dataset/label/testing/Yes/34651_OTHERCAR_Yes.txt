            We purchased this vehicle to have more long distance travel space.

I love the space, the way it handles on the highway.  Feels like a solid vehicle.  Has a smooth quiet ride like a car.  The doors are solid.  You have a feeling of being safe while traveling.

Like I said prior, I love the ride.  It handles very well on the highway. Has a lot of power, it doesn't pull and lag while going up hills, the momentum remains the same.

I think young and old alike should purchase this vehicle.  Young for long trips with children is great!  You have the space and the comfort for the long trips. You have a cargo area that is large enough to hold luggage toys etc.  Also a luggage rack for extra luggage.  Older families for the safety and the comfort.  The last thing you want to have to worry about is if you are hit broad sided as to wether or not you will walk away or are carried away.  I trust in the Pontiac name.  This is our fourth Pontiac van.  The first two were called Pontiac Transport and the third and fourth under the name of Pontiac Montana. Each one just got better and better. We have driven other vans and none compare to the style, comfort and safety that the Montana gives. 

I feel that Pontiac had the customer's safety first in mind when creating the Montana.  The style, comfort and reliability just come natural with the Pontiac name.<br><br>
