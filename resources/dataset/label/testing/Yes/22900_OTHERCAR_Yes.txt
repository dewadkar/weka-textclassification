            My husband talked me into buying this vehicle because a co-worker had one and after driving it once, my husband desperately wanted one.  We had been wanting to get a truck with lots of power to pull a load, something that looked nice, and had room for us and our two kids. 

In the summer of 1998, a local dealer had a few on their lot and we chose a used, red, 1996 Cummins with about 57,000 miles.  They assured us that the truck was just getting broke in at that point.  Although it cost us an arm and a leg, it has been well worth it.

We often pull a horse trailer full of cows, sheep or other animals and we can hardly tell we're pulling anything.  It has a very smooth ride, has plenty of leg room both front and back, and we haven't had any mechanical problems whatsoever.  The infinity sound system with the CD player rocks!

About the only things I wish were different are the condition of the interior; the previous owner put a few holes in the seat and didn't clean it up too great, and I wish we had the more updated quad cab; it's a pain getting the kids out of the back. <br><br>
