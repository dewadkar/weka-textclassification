            While I'm probably not the best photographer out there, I do enjoy being able to take a decent picture.  And to take a decent picture, you need a good camera, and a fair amount of control over the camera itself.  You're not likely to find even the amateur shutter-bug using a point and shoot camera.  That's why as a shutter-bug wanna-be, the C-700UZ turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.

Starting with the ability to control all of the settings of the camera, it's allowed me to experiment with speed, aperture, and other settings.  Combine that with the fact that I'm not wasting film and costing myself development fees, and I can play as much as I like to help teach myself the finer points of handling the camera without worrying about making mistakes.

The 10x zoom feature is mixed blessing.  While it's amazing to consider that they fit a 10x optical zoom lens in such a small package, they forgot to include the necessary image stabilization feature that would have truly made it useful.  As it stands, it's extremely difficult to take quality pictures at full zoom without the use of at least a mono-pod.  Even so, you'll still be able to get decent pictures from distances that any 3x zoom camera would never be able to match.

The picture quality itself is quite good.  Certainly not professional quality, but definitely good enough for home printing.  A good picture printed as a 8x11 and framed is good enough to be hung on the wall, and no one will even notice unless they look closely.  There is some evidence of purple fringe on bright highlights, but I've found that it's generally only a problem on extremely large highlights.  It generally not noticeable under regular use.

My only gripe with the camera is the fact that it has a bad tendency to go through batteries in no time.  Don't even bother trying to use it with alkalines.  As with any other digital camera, high capacity rechargeables are the way to go, but the battery life is quite respectable when using CR-V3 cells.  Also, the small size of the included SmartMemory card was disappointing, but I've since purchased a lager card so no worries there.

Overall, I'm quite happy with the camera.  It's proven to be more than capable of what I ask it to do and hasn't given me any troubles.
