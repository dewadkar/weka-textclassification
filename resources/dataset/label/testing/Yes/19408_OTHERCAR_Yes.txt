            I spent a long time researching 4WD trucks, cars and SUVs.  I narrowed it down to the Subaru Forestor and the Honda CRV.  I test drove both.  In the end there was just no way to justify spending an extra 5 thousand dollars to get the Forestor.  The CRV EX version had all the features I was looking for and some I didn't even know I wanted.  I had a horrible experience with the first dealership I went to.  I left very frustrated and agrevated.  I found a dealer who seemed to at least not run me around in circles.  The CRV sits you high off the road like a truck.  The view from up there is great.  You can see traffic better, and head lights from cars behind you are not a problem.  The CRV sits like a truck, but it handles like a car.  It is easy to handle.  It corners nicely, but you want to remember, all SUVs have the added height which makes them prone to roll over.  Because the Honda is on a traditional car base, it is less likely to roll than the taller truck type SUVs.  It has keyless remote entry and a CD player.  The instruments are clear and easy to read.  The cruise control is great for those of us who tend to get a little heavy footed on long rides.  My only complaint or thing I would change is that I would put arm rests on the front seats.  I believe they are now an option on the 2000 model.  After driving to Florida and back I can say they would be a wise investment&gt;  Over all the CRV is just big fun to drive and you get about 23 MPG which is better than most SUV gas hogs.<br><br>
