            This is the third Suzuki I have owned.  

The first was a Samurai (scary).

The second a Sidekick (flimsy).  

But the Grand Vitara is neither of these. I have owned one for about six months now and I am still very happy with my choice. For its size it feels much more substantial.  Very quiet compared to the old Sidekick model. The V6 engine is smooth and handles a automatic transmission with no problems. Just the V6 engine makes the Suzuki a better choice than the Chevy Tracker variant which only gets the 4 cylinder engine. The manual transmission model is quicker to get you going, but once your are rolling the automatic is no slouch.  The over all size of the Grand Vitara is not much bigger than of the old sidekick model. Suzuki did a very good job though making it bigger on the inside.

The fit and finish of the Grand Vitara is far better than the models that came before it.  Unlike the Sidekick that it replaced the windows and doors stay tight even under high winds. 

The only thing I don't care for is the fuel mileage.  Summer time 21 miles per gallon is the best. Living in the upper midwest and the switch to winter fuel formulation it has dropped to 18 miles per gallon. 

I did have to return once to the dealer for a Airbag warning light problem.  The problem was quickly fixed and has not returned. <br><br>
