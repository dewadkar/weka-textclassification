            1999 Pontiac Grand AM GT

I have had this car for 10 months (10,000 miles) and have had very little trouble with it.  I have identified some more pro's and con's.

PROS (might repeat from original opinion):

Engine:

This car is still peppy.  I enjoy being at a red light with no one in front or near me and just gunning the car, it really moves.  Big thumbs up for the engine.

Handling:

Better then normal, the car does sway a bit, but the 16&quot; tires keep it glued to the road, for the most part.

Traction Control/ABS:

This is a great feature, which comes standard on all GT's, not sure on SE's.  Tried this out with about 2 inches of snow on the ground.  Floored the accelerator and instead of the RPM's going high, the car kicked in traction control and lowered the RPM's, thus lowering the power of the engine and the wheels did not slip.  Very impressed with this feature.  So then I decided to lock up the breaks.  Yep, you guessed it, ABS kicked in and the brake pedal vibrated, as it should and I came to a controlled stop.

Price:

For the money this car delivers, and delivers big.  I don't get upset with the bill every month, I am happy to pay for it.


CONS (might repeat from original opinion):

Back Seats:

While the front seats are very comfortable, the back seats are comparable to a park bench.  Don't even think about having someone sit right in the middle, hard as a rock.

Valet Key:

For some reason GM doesn't give you a valet key.  I had this with my old car.  Now here is the kicker, they have a lock on the glove compartment and a switch on the trunk that locks the automatic trunk opener.  WHY???  If you give the key to the valet attendant, guess what, that key opens everything up.  The only idea I have is that you would lock those items if you left your car outside with the windows open or doors unlocked, besides that I have no clue.


Service Repairs:

Driver side sun visor needed to be replaced.

Have had one problem with the brakes.  Nothing big.  When braking at high speeds (i.e. 65 mph) the steering wheel will vibrate.  I believe the brakes just need to be cleaned or the rotors might be slightly warped.

The steering alignment is a bit off.  Just needs to be adjusted.


Nothing else besides that, just your usual oil change and tire rotation.

Best of luck to anyone that is thinking of leasing/purchasing this vehicle, if the car works as well as mine has, you will not be disappointed.

By the way, there are talks of a Pontiac Grand AM GTO, with 262 horsepower, watch out...<br><br>
