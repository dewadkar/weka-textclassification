                 The Ford Contour is a good all-around family car;  but definitely aimed towards the ladies, with its room, comfortable interior and lack of power.  However, I was pleased with the overdrive button, which gave that little extra &quot;umph&quot; when passing.  Though it wont be seen in the street races, it will get up and go.  Also, I know from experience, it can go a 1/4 mile through a field at 50mph and survive.
     With the Contour, you get a descent ride.  You get the room a family needs, with easy access, you lose some power, you get the durability and sporty look, and the price is fair.  The only problem I've seen from it is the air compressor froze up at about 32k miles, which is minor compared to some other vehicles I've had.<br><br>
