            I recently decided to test-drive the new 2001 Honda Accord LX V6 to see if the car had really changed all that much over the years.  Unless you were living under a rock throughout the 1990s, it was impossible not to see Accords everywhere you look.  I could be wrong because I do not know the precious number of vehicles every manufacturing sold, but I would guess that the Accord was among the most popular sedans sold during the 90s.  After driving the 2001 Accord, I can honestly say that not too much has changed over the years.

<b>Engine</b>
Let me first begin this review by stating that I test-drove the LX model with a V6 engine.  Honda did not limit your selections in this car.  In fact, it seems as though they have every model a human could choose.  The DX is the low end model packing a whooping 135 horses.  The EX is the high end model which has 150 horses in the I4 and 200 in the V6.  Finally, you have the LX which offers the same engine as the EX which packs 150 hp in the I4 and 200 in the V6.  Now that we have that out of the way.  

I was impressed overall by the Accords power.  Again, I did drive the V6 which had 200 horses.  The acceleration in the car was nice and smooth.  At no time during the drive did the car feel sluggish or lag.  During the test drive I took the car on the highway and it took no time to get up to 60 mph.  Even the acceleration at 60 mph to 70/75 mph was impressive.  

<b>Handling</b>
Throughout the entire ride the Accord handled very well.  During the test drive we did take the car on some back roads that were quite curvy.  The car had no trouble hugging the curves even at 45/50 mph.  There was an ever so slight roll at these speeds but nothing out of the ordinary.  This is a sedan�not a BMW roadster right?!?  

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior of the car is nice but a little �blah�.  The Accord is definitely not a car that the neighbors will be jealous of.  Then again�I guess that depends on what kind of neighbors you have.  The exterior has not changed that much over the years.  The car is slightly bigger (see interior) then it used to be.  This larger appearance is defiantly noticeable on the exterior.  The LX comes with an optional spoiler, which definitely adds to the car�s looks.  Fog lights are also available as an option, which increase safety along with the looks.  Overall, the outside of the Accord is nice but not extraordinary.

<b>Interior</b>
After recently test driving a lot of smaller cars, the interior of the Accord was a pleasant surprise.  This is one way in which the 2001 model has changed from the mid 1990 models.  The Accord is definitely roomy inside and could easily seat five adults inside within being uncomfortable.  

Everything else in the interior is good, but again not extraordinary.  All the controls and easily within reach and can easily be seen.  The stereo is above average, but not the best I have ever heard.  Every LX comes with a CD player and 6-speaker system installed.  An optional CD Changer and Tape Deck are options.  The seats are comfortable and roomy.  Leather is available as an option and adds to the cars looks and comfort.  The truck, along with the rest of the car, has become larger over the years.  You can easily store luggage or a couple sets of golf clubs.  

The Accord comes with decent theft systems such as ignition shut-off and alarm system.  Both the air conditioning and heat seemed as though they work great even though it wasn�t too hot or cold the day I took it for a test-drive.  Overall, I was pleased with the interior of the car.

<b>Reliability</b>
As always, a customer should not be too concerned with any Honda�s reliability.  They have become one of the leading automobile makers because people trust that their cars will not breakdown.  I do not see any reason why this would be different for the 2001 Honda Accords.

<b>Price</b>
The LX V6 is a little pricey.  The sticker price on the car was about $22,000.  After bargaining, you might be able to buy this car for about $20,500.  If you want to settle for a little less power, the LX I4 sells for about $18,500.  The EX will set you back about $25,000 for the V6 and about $21,500 for the I4.  Finally, if you really want an Accord and are on a tight budget, the DX will go for about $15,000.
