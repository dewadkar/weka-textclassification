            I recently bought a 1998 Chevy s-10 extended cab pickup truck.  This vehicle has power windows, doors, mirrors, 3rd door, ZR2 Offroad Package, tanneau cover, 4X4, and all the extras.  Pretty much fully loaded.  I love this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone.  There is no place it cannot go (for a stock vehicle).  It will not get stuck in any standard driving and I have never gotten it stuck offroading in the mud.  It is very nice looking and you can always depend on the chevy engine inside it.  The only bad part is that there is a large cost when buying it.  But not to worry, because of it being a pickup truck, and a Chevy at that, the resale will hold the price.  I strongly recommend to anyone.<br><br>
