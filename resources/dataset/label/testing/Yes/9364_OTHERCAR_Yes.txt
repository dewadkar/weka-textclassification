            I bought one a few months ago and although it is pricey, it is worth it. The SLR function of this camera makes it a cut above most digital cameras. I often see other camera users trying to get a good shot by looking at the preview screens. The C2500-L takes what appears in the eyepiece. It previews the shot for a few seconds after which also saves battery power. My only gripe is the lack of more zoom. However, you can get either OLYMPUS's 1.45x adapter or get an inexpensive 2x as well. It also  has the option for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash at the same time.

Overall a great camera and a great buy.<br><br>
