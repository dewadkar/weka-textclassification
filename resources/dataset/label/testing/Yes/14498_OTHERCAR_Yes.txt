            When I started looking for a new vehicle, I had to take into account the fact that I was going to have to haul around 3 little kids. I <i>thought</i> a truck was out of the question, Nissan came to my rescue!

The 2001 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab is every bit truck. It rides like a truck, drives like a truck, hauls like a truck etc... Make no bones about it, this isn't an SUV with the back chopped off!

There have been several complains levied again Nissan about creating a truck which is enemic in power, but so far I haven't had any problems. It generates 170BHP and 210ft.lbs of torque and, so far, hasn't had a problem hauling anything that is within the 5,000lb towin limit capacity. Given, I live in "flat country" (Oklahoma), but never the less, this truck has plenty of power for every day use. 

Seems like every time I stop <i>someone</i> wants to ask questions about it! I am always happy to ablige. There are a few cons to the truck though:

1. Stereo System is not for the audiophile marke. This system lacked serious power and had very flat sound. There is NO room behind the rear seat to facilitate anything larger than a 6" subwoofer (don't bother with the factory sub... its a joke) in a tube (like a Bazooka) so this has been my biggest complaint.

2. Gas Mileage. This this is BY NO MEANS a beast, 170hp is adequate, but at 15MPG city? Come on Nissan! get with the program! With gas prices soaring right now, I can definatley see more and more cash going to the tank and less and less going to the lake.

3. Non-Negotiable dealers. Most dealers that have Crew Cabs in stock right now are not dealing on the price much. You can expect to pay between -$300 and +$500 sticker for one. Why? I don't know. (I negotiated at 10:30pm on the last day of August and managed to get $2,000 off the price of my truck.. it can be done folks!)

4. Service SUCKS. Nissan build on heckuva vehicle, granted! But you had better hope it NEVER breaks down. If you have to deal with the black holes Nissan calls a service center, be sure to take you heart medication before you get there. I have about 13,000 on my truck at present and have only had one problem. I had a radiator hose leaking. Pretty simple, right? hehe.. I had to wait 2 DAYS for them to ship the hose in from a neighboring state! A HOSE! 

5. Accessories. - They are hard to come by, but that will change soon. This truck has allready started taking off like crazy.

The Pros? easy... the looks of the thing. This is a beefy looking hunk-of-a-truck! Thats the only reason ANYONE would buy one. The bed isn't big enough to be a work truck, and the cab isn't roomy enough to be a family traveler. It's a compromise for those of us who don't want to drive the "land-yachts" people are calling SUV's and don't want to drive the "speed bumps" people are calling cars. This is a great all around truck! Here are some other great features:

1. The ride is exceptional for a truck.
2. the noise level is definatley lower than most trucks I have driven. 
3. Car seats fit easily in the rear and are easy to access from the rear doors. 
4. Child locks make the rear "kid friendly" 
5. Car seat anchors in the rear are a great standard item.
6. the In-Dash 6 Disc changer is reliable and virtually un-skippable. It also comes with steering wheel remote controlls which spoil you fast!
7. Ride height is great, you either step into or up to your truck, most people will not sit down into it.
8. Cup holders and middle console are thoughtfully designed and well placed for easy access.
9. Engine is quiet and smooth. Romping on it isn't recomended- you will be dissapointed.
10. skid plates are standard on the SE series and are made of THICK steel plating, not thin plating like many other trucks.
11. Throwout bearing problem has been fixed and the driveline is time-proven.

All in all, you WILL get your money's worth out of this little truck. HECK, its a NISSAN!
