            Just when you thought it was safe to buy a luxury car, Acura has to go change everything. As of 2001 Acura (Honda) will release then brand new and quite intimidating Acura CL-S.

Lets not doodle around; I want to explore what this car is in comparison with the other cars of its class.

Performance: Let me start of by saying that this normal looking car has a massive 260 hsp!  For you that do not know much about hsp that is as much as a Mustang GT with a V-8.  The CL-S has a massive 3.2 lit V-Tec V-6 and is one of the BEST performing V-6's on the market when you figure in gas eco. Vs. power. Best of all, after you drop your kid off at school and have your morning coffee let the other cars tremble when you rocket from
0-60 in 6.57 sec's! This massive amount of power out classed the BMW 328Ci (with sport package), Mercedes-Benz CLK320, and the Volvo C70 HT. The closest in the mighty pursuit was the Mercedes-Benz CLK320 at 7 seconds or close to it if I remember (check out www.acura.com for the latest specs). The CL-S's powerhouse is that of the Acura super car the NSX. The CL-S utilizes the same super car V-Tech design and also my O so favorite NSX sport shifter which allows the driver to drive an automatic or a         simi-manual (no clutch) tran'y. And might I add that car and driver clams that the NSX sport shifter is the best sports shifter ever made, period. Plus the handling in this car is the best. You will find yourself driving at speeds approaching 120 mph and still only have 2 fingers on the steering wheel. You have the O so nice double-wishbone suspension which makes pot-holes that look like gorges feel like pebbles beneath your tires. The very latest in traction control from those physicists gurus at Honda. Speaking of traction, hopefully the newly designed alloy rims and tires will keep you on the road and out of it (traction haha get it, (what a loser right=-)).

Comfort: Boy o boy where to begin, I guess I'll start on a little story.
You wake up to your morning coffee, and you open your paper and notice its time to go to work thankfully you wife just got home. You jump up and meet her at the door grab the keys and head out to the car. You unlock the door with your keyless remote entry system (good for those late night in back alleys just press the button and jump in). And as always you have to readjust your seat and mirrors, but at the mere push of a button the mirrors move into your placement along with you 8-way powered directional seat. And of couse on the cold winter morning the nice automatic temperature control is a Godsend. You set is for 75 is stays 75, no more of turning the heat up then down then up ect. You embellish your standard leather seating and your allergies aren't worked up because of the new micro-filtering system. As you begin your journey to the dreaded work place, you feel the sudden urge for deafening sounds of music. With the standard Acura/Bose music system with the 6 disk changer in dash CD changer and the always-popular AM/FM stations the CL-S is happy to add to your already noticeable hearing impairment (are those sirens? naaaaa).
And thus ends you wonderful trip to the office with all the standard luxuries as well. 

Quality: It's a Honda, need I say more. I will for the sake of argument.
The CL and CL-S come with a 4-year/50,000 mile limited warranty, a
5-year/unlimited-mileage outer body rust-through warranty and a year/50,000 Acura Total Luxury Careï¿½ (TLC) package with roadside assistance. But you will never need any of these because, its a Honda.

Safety: Nothing new and innovative but the best of what's around. Dual front air bags, and side impact air bags. There is actually an automatic height guessing chip for the disabling of the air bags because of children ( so there is no "oops, I forgot to disable it manually so my kid died" thing going on, no joke, very very important). You got the latest in crumple zone tech. and of course ABS(anti-lock brakes).

My Favorite thing: I loved the navigation system. This thing some how maintains a mobile satellite uplink to a quazi-GPS like system. The push button interface allows you to push where you are then where your going it will actually talk you to the place. It will announce upcoming turns and confusing bypasses will be announced in perfect clarity. This is one          of the most refined nav systems I have ever seen short of military use.

One other thing, short of the nav. system, everything is standard. And the price is so low for what your getting you'd swear the thing was hot.
At the MSRP of $ 32,785 it has at least a $ 10,000 price difference to it's closest competitor (even the Toyota).
