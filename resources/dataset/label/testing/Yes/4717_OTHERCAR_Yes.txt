            I have been on the hunt for a BMW ever since I purchased an older
(1983) 7 series for my son for his first car. I was very impressed by the
construction and features in this 17 year old car. In spite of the fact it has about a quarter million miles on the clock it still runs well.

So after months of going back and forth between the 5 series and the 7 series as my target I spotted a good deal over the net at a wholesale dealer and went to take it for a ride... I left with a purchase agreement.

I am very impressed with this car. The only flaw I have been able to find is one that was mentioned in another review, when a back window is open it sounds like there is a mega-subwoofer in the back seat stuck on 4Hz and it is painful to the ears. Easy enough to plan for once you know it, just open a front window or the roof vent.

It is a sheer joy to drive this car. Absolutely the best luxury car I have ever driven. The creature comforts are astounding. The cockpit is well laid out. All of the controls and buttons are within easy reach, the ones you use the most are also on the steering wheel. Heated seats and steering wheel. I especially like the heat that comes in the lumbar area.
The power seats are so comfortable that I'm thinking of going to a junkyard and buying a couple more to mount on a base and add an electrical system to to use for tv viewing in my home... My son thinks that is a great idea!
The engine is powerful but extremely quiet. I can listen to the superb sound system even at highway speeds and hear every detail in the music with virtually no wind or engine noise to distract from it. The DSP allows me to choose whether I'm in a concert hall, in a jazz club, cathedral or just about anyplace I choose by the simple push of a button.

When I popped open the trunk my son said it all &quot;Hey dad, I could live in there&quot;. I should have no problem putting my mountain bike in there.

For a 3 year old car with 55k on the clock it is in very nice condition.
A couple stone chips here and there but nothing I can't detail out with a bit of care. I'm looking forward to my long commute to work every day rather than dreading it...
