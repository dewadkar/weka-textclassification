            After two years on the subways and busses of metro Boston, I decided it was time for a car.  I was set on a used car, but then I saw the 2000 Civic VP, which cost less than the used cars I was looking at.  I had never driven one before, but knew everyone recommended it for its size, driving style, and reliability.  

I have been completely satisfied considering the (low)amount of money I spent.  The VP(&quot;value package&quot;) is the base DX with the added standards of automatic trans, power locks/keyless entry, A/C, and CD player (my favorite).  They also have one color on the exterior  - not that band of black on the doors like the older models. Mine is silver and is hot hot hot!  

I've had the car since May, and recently drove to Ohio and back to Boston within a few weeks.  After a 1500 mile trip, she wasn't complaining at all. The ride was comfortable enough, but really no car is comfortable after twelve hours!  With a total of 4800 at her first oil change, she didn't even need it.  I plan to keep her at least five years (when she is paid off), if not longer.  

I will probably upgrade to a car with a bigger engine, only because I am used to driving bigger cars and get frustrated sometimes when my car gets a slow start on hills / entrance ramps (but it could be worse). This may be different with a standard; the automatic can shift erratically on hills (Honda calls it &quot;Grade Shift Logic&quot; but it doesn't seem logical to me!)

MILEAGE: On my big trip, I got 40 mpg on highways, which is great with these prices.  I got from Ohio to Boston on two tanks.  Also, the car is a low emission vehicle (LEV), so the planet likes the civic too.

With all of the pros, this is great buy for around $12,000-$14,000, and Honda has good financing too.
