            Just 3 months ago, I purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang Convertible, automatic,
with air, fully loaded, maroon with a tan top. It is the best car I have yet driven, since my first Mustang in 1970, which was a three speed, convertible, red with a white top. I get great gas mileage, but in my older model, I got better mileage because it was a stick, and didn't use a s much gas. I am very pleased with the overall performance, of my new vehicle. The Mustang I had in 1970 was a 1965. It was also a six cylinder 
without the all new gadgets and gimmicks on these newer engines they have in the new vehicles. The Mustang I have now, is a V-8, and runs excellent.
I am a Mustang fan, and always will be. I have owned over ten Mustangs in 
my life, and would own another one, if I could afford to buy one. It has great turning ability, a lower center of gravity pull, and again great performance over all. The warranty provided by the Ford Motor Company is an excellent one also. I would go with buying a Mustang, if you like a sporty look, and great performance.
Sincerely,
John<br><br>
