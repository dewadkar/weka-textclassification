            I LOVE MY CAR!!! What really sold me on this car was the stylish look, and the smooth comfortable ride it gives. For this to be a mid-size car it really handles curves extremely well. I made a quick and sharp U-turn and it handles like a small compact car, very even turning and you don't get that feeling that you are going to tip over or loose control of the car. I purchased the four cylinder model and the power on it is much better than the Camry or Accord in my opinion, of which both I have driven. Another thing that really helps my opinion of this car is the fact that if you are in a front car crash the front body ridges, which causes the impact of the crash to be much less once it reaches the cabin of the car.  Also, the side body of the car is triple steel beam reinforced which makes side impacts less threating also. The Galant offers a stylish look that is ideal for young people with families that still want that "hip look", and even stylish enough for those that are single. I being a single woman am very pleased to find a car that is versitile in this situation. I drove off the lot with 10 miles on my car and now it has about 200 so it is still new but I did take it on the Interstate for a quick "breaking in". Traveling over 110 MPH the ride was very comfortable and the engine is not loud at all and feels like you are simply coasting down a normal highway. On my Galant I average about 25 mpg which is fairly good for the type of car it is. I do think there could be more room in the back, but since I will probably never ride back there, and have no kids, that was not a major downfall on the Galant for me. The trunk space is roomy, but the inside access to the trunk is fairly small but again no major downfall to me.  This is my first car that I have bought brand new, and being 19 years old I feel that I have made a good first investment.  I feel that it fits my personality which is young and hip, but a career woman and business oriented also.
