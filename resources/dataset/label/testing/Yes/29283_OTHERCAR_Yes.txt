            A Mustang is a Sporty Car.  The CAMARO 2000 and 2001 is a SPORTS CAR.  What a fantastic car!  The CAMARO is just amazing.  Two reasons:  It is a show-stopper.  And it is so inexpensive for what you get that you can laugh as you pass the guy or gal in the sports car next to you all the way to the bank.  Insurance is among the lowest in the industry for the base model.  And it will cost you about $24,000 loaded to the brim depending on the State sales tax:  This included leather, the MONSOON 500 watt stereo CD system and theft deterrent system.  EVERYTHING.  Tons of power in the base model.  3.8Liter engine with 200 horsepower.  If you want the higher powered V8 5.7Liter then you might as well buy a Corvette because you will pay about $5000 more and the insurance is the through the roof.  It is not worth it.  

The base model is so much fun to drive.  And contrary to the critics . . . the car is very practical.  Lots of storage space, fold down rear seats, T-Tops and Convertible are easy to take off and operate, the design is very cool (compliments will follow) and if you have a perfect driving record the insurance is about $1200 a year.  What a steal when the Porsche and Viper demand $5000 - $7000 insurance premiums per year.  

VERY COMFORTABLE

It has traction control so you can drive it in the snow.  The 2000 and 2001 models are the same.  NO CHANGES WERE MADE to the base model.  So buy the 2000 model and save even more.  What a great deal.  And it is so much fun to drive.  I have already put 5000 miles on after two months.<br><br>
