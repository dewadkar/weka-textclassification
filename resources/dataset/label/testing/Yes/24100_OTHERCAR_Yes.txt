            We were very impressed and sold on the new 2000 LeSabre after a check out at a dealership and a subsequent test drive. The overall size, interior and exterior, is just about right for someone like ourselves who needed six passenger comfort on ocassion but didn't need the expanse and did not have the garage space of a full size automobile.

The Limited model has the right combination of comfort and luxury we were accustomed to in our former luxury sedan but at a much more affordable price. The automatic everything is just what we expected and the addition of the &quot;heads-up&quot; display is a hoot.

The cast aluminum wheels add a touch of class. The standard wheel covers look like the plastic that they are. Our only negative so far has shown up when we've tried to load the trunk with golf equipment for a foursome. It is a bit of  a stretch to get the fourth set of clubs in comfortably when one or more bags are oversize.

One production glitch showed up after a few days: a defective windshield wiper motor which drained the battery. Both promptly replaced by dealership and so far all's well.<br><br>
