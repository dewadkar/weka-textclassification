            I love Volvo cars.  I have owned my S40 since the February of this year and I have driven it everywhere.  It is great inside and out.  The leather seats, the stereo sound, and so many other options make this vehicle one of the best in the market.  The price is pretty affordable too.  It ranges from 22,900 up to 30,000 or over depending on the options.  It has a turbo charged engine that goes up to 160 horse power.  But it is the smoothest ride I have ever taken.  It is pretty quiet inside so you don't have to worry about outside noise.  The air conditioning system works great.  It would clear your windows fast.  It also has a sports and a weather gear available for those who like to drive faster or for those who are stuck on ice.

If you have a chance to at least try one or to test drive it, just do it.  You will not regret it.  The car looks very classy inside and very slick outside.
I have already driven almost 15000 miles with it and I am not stopping.<br><br>
