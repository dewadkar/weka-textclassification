            I just purchased my second Grand Am.  I love my car. I first owned a 1994 Grand Am and enjoyed it very much.  This car was almost paid off and I wanted a new car in 1998.  We traded it in on a Breeze in 1998.  This was a bad mistake.  We traded the Breeze in as soon as we could on a 1999 Grand Am. This a very comfortable riding car.  There is plenty of room.  The car drives and handles well and gets good gas mileage. The car has plenty of pick up. I am glad we made the decision to get another Grand Am.<br><br>
