            Bought a '96 Windstar two weeks ago, $12,000, all the options except traction control, power seats, keyless entry &amp; the CD changer.  I'm a 32 year old single male, I enjoy taking roadtrips with friends, and was actually looking at buying a conversion van.  However, after checking out the Windstar, I immediately decided on buying it, and am extremely happy thus far.  

Positive issues:  Extremely effective view of the road and surroundings, absolutely outstanding air conditioner and climate control in general.  VERY roomy, I've had eight people in the van and it was still quite spacious (and still handled quite well, surprisingly enough).  Gas mileage seems to be averaging around 22-25mpg, which is a marked improvement from my last two cars.  Acceleration is quite astonishing considering the size and weight of the van, I'm guesstimating around 8.5 second 0-60 on a half tank of gas, and it cruises as nicely at 85mph as it does at 65.  Real nice cruise-mobile, I tell you what.  Nice sound system as well.  

Negatives?  As a huge vehicle, turning radius is obviously a bit lacking, but the power steering is nimble enough to allow two-fingered turning.  The rev-limiter seems a bit over-eager to engage on spirited acceleration, have noticed several times the engine just cutting out unexpectedly.  Wind noise is a bit high, and the suspension seems a bit lacking, transmitting pretty much every bump in the road to the passengers.  The steering wheel, with its hideous textured finish is painful to handle (I'm currently evaluating numerous steering wheel covers as an alternative).  As a tall guy at 6'2&quot;, I also have some problems with the width of the seat (too narrow) and the height (too high), I'm constantly needing to rearrange my legs in the compartment to prevent them from falling asleep, which could be a bit of a problem for longer trips.  Maybe having the power seats would take care of this, but aside from that, maybe installing an aftermarket Van-style Captain's Chair would solve this as well.  

Aside from that?  I kind of wish there was some way of opening the side/rear windows for ventilation (as in an actual van), but I guess that would compromise the vehicle's crash protection and safety.  Otherwise, I'm quite happy with this, and will likely be keeping it for quite a while indeed.<br><br>
