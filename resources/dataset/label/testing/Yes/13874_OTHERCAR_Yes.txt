            I bought a 94 Excel 2 door 5 speed new in August 1994. I have always had bigger cars with all the toys however a slight cash flow problem made the Hyundai necessary, but I was reluctant! Over 5 years later I have absolutely no regrets as the little rice burner is unequivocally the best car I've ever had (but not the nicest car).

With 112000 mostly highway miles on the clock there has been no trouble at all with the car and there is no sign of any trouble. It has had routine maintenance as with any car...brakes,tires,tune ups and regular oil changes. The only non routine repairs were tie rod ends at 90000 miles and rear wheel cylinders at 100000 miles (covered by extended warranty).

Is it all roses? No. The car is somewhat noisy at 60/70 mph and has a choppy ride. There are few creature comforts but you don't buy this class of vehicle if you want Cadillac comfort!

On the plus side the car, with a 5 speed manual, is fun to drive and quite comfortable for two in general driving (I am 6ft 5 at 260lbs like the guy in the Suzuki commercials on TV a while back).

At this point oil consumption is just under one quart between oil changes (6000 miles). There is no rust despite daily driving in heavy salt conditions in our southern ontario winters and I still have the original exhaust system on the car. Although I am lusting after a new Sonata there is  no way I can justify retiring this bullet proof Excel! The local dealer has one customer who has just turned 300000 mileson a 94 Excel so I guess I'm stuck with mine for a while.

The Excel, out of production for 6 years, is of little interest to current car buyers but a look at older models like this gives some indication of quality and by all accounts quality now is even better!

Finally...nuts to Consumers Report which regularly pans Hyundai!
