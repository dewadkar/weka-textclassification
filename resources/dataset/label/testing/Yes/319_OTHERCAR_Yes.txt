            On December 26, 1999 (my birthday)an 85 year old man in a Lincoln Town Car barrelled through an intersection resulting in the total loss of my 1992 Mazda Miata.  Needless to say it was a harrowing experience seeing all that metal impending upon my person in a vehicle which was no match for the collision. 
What came out of it was my purchase of a green 2000 Nissan Xterra SE.  Thus far I love it.  It is cost efficient at $24,000.00 and an Xcellent segueway into the sport utility market.  It is well equipped(though I wish the dealership would have thrown in some floor mats and a tow package) and is fun to drive.  The Xterra is novel vehicle on the road and is distinguished by its self-titled roof rack system which should thwart many potential questions like &quot;what kind of vehicle is this?&quot;
The detachable luggage basket can be placed in the cargo area of the SUV to keep groceries and other items organized (a useful discovery).  I was anticipating the opportunity to pop off the sky-roof which after reading the manual I found does not come off.  One salesman mentioned the skyroof was the only flaw found by Motor Trend in selecting the Xterra as the SUV of the year. Its ride is not as smooth as a Navigator but is comparable to the Land Cruiser in body shake.  Anyone looking to make a unique entrance into the SUV class owes the Xterra a look see.
