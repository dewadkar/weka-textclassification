            Yes it's true, this car was rated the number one compact sedan by Car & Driver just a short while back in a 10 car comparison including the Mitsubishi Mirage, Nissan Sentra, Hyundai Elantra, and Honda Civic.  What?  You say you've never heard of this car?  You say no one you know drives this car?  You say you don't remember the last time you saw one on the road?  Well, that is exactly what I thought, too.  If it's a good car, then why aren't more people driving it?  I was skeptical at first, even though I had read the comparison extensively.  Why?  Well, I own two Nissans, a 98 Sentra and a 00 Maxima, both great cars for the money and both have run pretty smoothly during their time of service. 

When I went shopping for a new car with my girlfriend (she's upgrading from a 91 Hyundai Scoupe, YUCK!), I didn't really even consider the Mazda (it's the damn lack of advertising that everyone keeps mentioning).  We were in the market for the 01 Sentra, a stylish, peppy, feature loaded car in it's own right.  We happened across the Mazda dealer by chance since it was just next door.  To my surprise, for about the same price as the Sentra, we got a pretty good deal.  Why?  Well, we were able to get a Protege ES (1.8L, 122HP, CD, cassette, power everything, automatic, AC, 15" Alloys, remote keyless entry).  

I didn't get a chance to drive the vehicle till we took it home.  My first impression?  Wow!  The first thing that I noticed was how SMOOTH the automatic transmission is (compared to my 00 Maxmia, 98 Sentra, and 96 Accent)!  There is none of that familiar "hitch" when the gear catches during upshift; the transmission never feels like it's searching for the right gear, it always feels natural and smooth.  It is completely smooth, a description that doesn't even describe my $20k Maxima.  The transmission feels more like my friend's BMW if anything, I am truly impressed by the EXCELLENT transmission (even more impressed if you tell me that Ford engineers came up with it).  On top of the great transmission, the inside of the car is much roomier than the inside of the Sentra, especially the rear seats where my foot actually gets stuck under the front seats of the Sentra (how embarassing).  There is plenty of room for 4 passengers to travel with comfort.  The 122HP engine is definitely very peppy (Zoom, Zoom!), it will give decent acceleration and never feels/sounds like it is being overworked; in contrast, it is eager and waiting to be pushed (wait till we break the car in!) around every corner, over every hill, and from every single red light you will ever sit at.  The interior sound level is also very good, you hardly notice the engine during normal driving.  The driving position is excellent (though the doors seem to come up a little too high), the driver has an excellent view of the road ahead and a decent view of the sides.  Another big plus is the great handling; the steering is extremely tight and pinpoint accurate, as mentioned by others, probably due to the ES's 15" alloys and sport tires.  I am thoroughly impressed by how responsive the steering is, much better than the Sentra's dulled feel and much more like a higher class car/sports car.  This car drives extremely well and hugs corners like an environmentalist hugs redwoods.  It makes you want to do illegal things on those winding, curvy, residential streets (which is exaclty what I did with my girlfriend screaming at me the whole time :) ).  What else?  Well, the trunk is absolutely cavernous for a car that appears to be relatively small from the exterior, the designers/engineers did a good job of squeezing space into a compact design.  This is perfect for girlfriends who insist on bring EVERYTHING home for winter/spring break.  On top of that, the trunk and the trunk lights are ingeniously designed to give you a very large, very wide "mouth" which makes loading large objects easier (is it ever truly easy?).  The great gas mileage helps a lot too for those on a tight budget, like my girlfriend (my V6 Max makes me reminisce of my Sentra's consistent 30+ MPG).

As with any car, this one has it's cons too.  One big gripe is that rear seats are just WAY too stiff for any acceptable form of long distance travel.  The brakes are also incredibly stiff too.  I mean, this thing is STIFF!  On top of that,the breaks seem to be too underpowered, the stopping power feels inadequate (or maybe this is just a percieved illusion caused by the STIFF brakes).  Though the exterior looks slick (silver with chrome looking alloy wheels), the interior is another story.  We're talking plastic, lots of it and boring plastic at that.  The buttons on the stereo are pretty stiff too, they just don't "feel good" when you push any of the buttons.  It feels like you are breaking something cause you have to press so hard. On top of the crappy buttons, the sound system is a too bassy and lacks quality mid/hi tones, but that isn't too bad.  Another problem is that the engine is pretty loud, but luckily only from the outside.  I make this statement in comparison to my V6 Maxima which makes very little noise and actually kinda hums gently.  And my final gripe?  Well, the rearview mirrors (all 3) are undersized just a tad...makes me feel unsafe.

I have nothing to say yet about the craftsmanship of the engine or the reliability of the car as of yet (she just bought it yesterday, 3/10/01), but from what I have heard and read (see the epinion a couple down), Mazdas have a good history of reliability and great craftsmanship for the price.

My recommendation?  If you are on a budget, go out now and try to pick up a 2000 ES model (the extra 19 horses make a BIG difference).  The newly redesigned 2001 model is just on the horizon and most dealers will be trying to move inventory this spring/summer in preperation for the fall.  If you have a little more money to spend, definitely buy the new 2001 model.  On top of it's new, more "aggressive" front-end styling (truly a stunning and stylish redesign), it gets the benefit of an added 8 horses (2.0L ES we're talking here).  Will definitely recommend that my sis buys a 2001 ES when the time comes.

Conclusion: the peppy engine, smooth transmission, large interior, and great handling combine for a convincing package that strongly outweigh the cons of this car.  At the same price range as a Sentra GXE, Corolla, Civic, Elantra, and Mirage, this car shines brightly as one of the top choices in terms of performance/features for your money.  It delivers a touch of sport, a touch of safety, a touch of utilitarianism, and a touch of class not found in ANY of it's competitors.  This car is nothing short of breathtaking (relatively of course, we're not talking BMW/Porsche/Merc/Etc. breathtaking).  It'll sure make those 50 Mi. highway commutes MUCH more enjoyable for my girlfriend (91 Hyundai Scoupe, YUCK!).
