            The new Nissan maxima epitomizes the saying &quot;nothing exceeds like excess.&quot; It is a lovely car, it handles beautifully, and it has far more power, particularly with the manual transmission, than anyone could rationally need.
The body is nice and fresh (the 1995-1999 Maxima looked a little tubby) and the ergonomics are right on. However, as the bargain days for cheap gas approach their end, it might be time to rethink the 200+ hp. family sedan. With a properly breathing 4 cyl (such as Nisan's current Altima) this car could be made 250 - 300 lbs. lighter (engine, transmission, tires, wheels, the whole package) which would also allow a far superior handling package as less weight would be riding up front.
A 4 cyl Maxima might not sound very exciting, but it could make serious inroads into the Camry and Accord.
As is, the base 6 cyl maxima, at dealer pricing under 20k (I was quoted $19150 at one dealer and $19,500 at another) is the hottest family car on the market.<br><br>
