            I bought this camera for my wife because I was tired of paying for all her trips to the one hour photo developer and paying a premium.  She is very active with E-Bay auctions, so the need was definitely there.  In her pre-Sony days, I had bought her a scanner.  She would shoot the pics, run to the local Arbor Drug to drop them off for developing, come home and wait, go back an hour or so later to pick them up, then sit and scan them all.  She would shoot several rolls of film at a time, so the cost was getting up there and all the scanning was becoming quite time intensive.  After picking the pics up, she would notice that the lighting or look of a photo or two wouldn't work and this would discourage her.  In an effort to keep her spirits up and save time and money, I bought her the Sony MVC-FD83.  The camera paid for itself the first month.

I thought I would have to spend a great deal of time showing her how to operate it, but she learned it quickly and on her own.  I was quite impressed how fast she was able to get up and running.  Now she shoots the pics, can see what she's going to have before committing the pic to floppy disc, and has them on the web in a matter of minutes.  I am truly amazed by todays technology and have always been satisfied with Sony products.

We went to her fathers house for Christmas.  She brought the camera and had taken pics of her little brothers.  She then printed them right there in front of the boys just seconds later.  Her father was so impressed with the quality of the printed pics that he put them on every cupboard door in the kitchen.  A very nice touch for the holidays.  Enough of that...

Anyone doing any web auctioning NEEDS this camera.  Anyone with a great printer would love to have the quick photos or send them on-line to relatives quickly.

I paid $699 for the camera several months ago, which I thought was a bit high at the time.  The only thing I didn't like about the purchase was the fact there was no camera case included with the purchase.  You would think that for $699 you would at least get a case, I mean, Sony, come on.  As one Christmas present, I decided to buy the case.  There may or may not have been a standard case available in the back room of the Circuit City, but I was stuck paying $70-$80 for a case that came with a spare battery and 3 floppy discs, which was all the store had to offer.

All in all, I am very pleased and strongly recommend this product.  I've kept this review as simple as possible while still trying to convey to you that this is a must have camera.  Hat's off to Sony once again.<br><br>
