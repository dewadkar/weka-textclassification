            I love the luxurious interior of this car, the Germans seem to have thought of every little detail. The attention to detail is obvious everywhere you look. It has a great sound system (like being at a live concert). The heated front and rear seats are great in the winter. The ride is smooth and rough curves are a breeze in this car (probably the quattro system help out). The exterior styling is very sleek. It is a beautiful car. I am happy with the engine and it's performance. One has a sense of security once inside the car as it feels so solid. I like the three headrests and the large amount of legroom at the back.
The price is well worth for the A6, specially when you see the quality of the materials and quattro. My husband and i both drive this car. For short and tall people alike you can easily get a very comfortable seating position. This is definitely for people who look for luxury and comfort in car. You now have a choice of three engines in the US. Those who wish for a very sporty drive the Audi A6 2.7t or the A6 4.2 are the other choices now available. <br><br>
