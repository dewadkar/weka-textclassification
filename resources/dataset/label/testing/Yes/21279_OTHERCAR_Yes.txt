               The Camry offers a fantastic ride and high gas mileage at a reasonable price.  The headroom is surprisingly good in the front, but a little cramped in the rear.  A small to average size adult should have no problems getting a comfortable ride, but taller people might feel a little cramped.  I have had very few mechanical problems with the car, and the service has always been good. Taking the car to a Toyota dealer is always a good idea because the service is usually faster and almost always more dependable.  In addition, the sound system is fairly good for a car of its type, and the upholstery is tough enough to take abuse from kids and adults alike.<br><br>
