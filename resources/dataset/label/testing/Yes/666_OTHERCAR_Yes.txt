            This camera worked wonderfully until I ran out of batteries (which was after 15-20 exposures). So the first thing I did was to buy a couple of rechargeable batteries and a recharger. Keep at least three sets of four batteries, so that two sets are always charged. And shut off the camera if you are not planning to shoot a picture within the next ten seconds! This one eats batteries. 

You can decide the quality of the pictures by choosing the number of pixels. Don't choose too few, 1200 x 1600 gives you good quality. The camera is easy to use and has a lot of options to use when you shoot under different light conditions.

Downloading pictures from this camera has been a nightmare. Until someone told me that I could download new software from Nikon's website, it worked about one time in twenty tries! The seller of the camera was not very helpful either after he had pocketed my $900. 

With the updated software, however, it is much better, but the camera  keeps bugging me with error messages sometimes, and I have to start the downloading all over again. I have used Nikon's 24 hour phone service several times and they have been very helpful. But why should you encounter these problems at all with a $900 camera?<br><br>
