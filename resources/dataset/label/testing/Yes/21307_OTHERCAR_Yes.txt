<TEXT>
            I'm 16 years old and I currently don't have a license, yet. My parents bought me a '94 Plymouth Sundance Duster on my 16th birthday. I do, however, have my permit. I've been driving this vehicle for a month and to all the teens out there, this car is every teen's dream. I thought I wanted a Corvette or a Viper or something, and when my parents pointed this car out at the lot, I was unconvinced that this car could be IT. In driver's training I was privileged enough to be able to drive 6 totally different types of vehicles, all 2000 models. But believe it or not I would much rather drive around my 6 year old car. I've read all the other opinions and I'm totally understanding of everyone's viewpoint, but let me tell you one thing. This car is one of the best FIRST cars, but If you have kids, buy a Grand Am. Or something bigger and more advanced.  <br><br>
