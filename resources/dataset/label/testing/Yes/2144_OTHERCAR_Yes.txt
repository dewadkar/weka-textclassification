            I purchased my 2dr VW Golf GL new. I have had NO problems with this car, except that the glove compartment has broken twice. :) Very comfortable seats. It has adjustable head rests in the front and back. And easily adjustable front seats.  The pull for the front seat release (so passengers can climb into the back) does tend to come off, but it doesn't break, it just needs to be slipped back on. It does have a surprising amount of leg room in the rear. However, it can be cramped in the back with three adults. It does have slightly large blind spots. Ample cargo space! The rear seats fold almost perfectly flat. This gives you a lot of room from the back of the front seats all the way to the hatch. Great! Four cup holders, two in the front, and two in the rear. Tilt steering. No cruise control in this model, no power windows either. :( It has intermittent wipers (about 8-10 different speeds!). Rear wiper and defroster. The Monsoon sound system is phenomenal. Eight speakers in a little car! Always sounds great at any volume and bass setting. Came with a 6 CD changer, AM/FM radio and cassette player. Quiet and smooth ride even at 90mph. Great gas mileage. I average 29-30mpg. The 2.0L/4cyl. engine can certainly get out of its own way. However, it is not a GTI. I've used this vehicle for camping and it has powered over steep, gravel hills and handled ruts and potholes well. No re-alignment needed. Great for city driving as well! Awesome handling, wide stance gives stability around curves. Wheels have never slipped. The VW front wheel drive has even been able to handle a good amount of snow.
