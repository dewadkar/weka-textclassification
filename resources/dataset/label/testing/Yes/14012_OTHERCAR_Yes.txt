            I am usually apathetic about any of my Dad's new cars, since he usually goes for those big American things.  But, for once he had branched out (I should really go to the car show with him more often) and branched well he did!  

This is a great car for the price he paid.  There are two major criteria in car buying for him, size of the trunk and placement of the cup holders.  This car, although a good 15 inches shorter than his old Park Avenue, will still get two sets of golf clubs in.  This is very important to any serious golfer.  The cupholders are not in a spot that gets in the way of shifting, an annoying feature on many new cars.  In fact, besides the usual two in the center, there are ones that fold out in front of the side dash air vents.  An odd location, but the cup will sit in front of the air vent if you place it there, and it's a great way to keep a cold drink cold in the summer!

There are several other nifty extras on this car:

*It has heated seats with a high and low setting, so you can be toasty but not burning up.  

*The back window had a built in sunshade that folds out for those really bright days.  It works very well and does not impede your vision.  

*You can get a built in GPS system for this car.  Although he did not get it, it seemed to work easily in the model we looked at that had one.  It was placed on the dash in the middle so either driver or passenger could use it.

This car also rides very well.  Over a rather bumpy area of freeway I go over often, it was noticeably less rough of a ride than in the other cars I am in often, even my Saturn, which has a nice ride.  The interior is surprisingly roomy for the smaller size of the car, although the middle passenger in the backseat should be a fairly small person.  Good acceleration, easy to get on the freeway faster than the other guy with.  All in all, this car is defiantly more than just an expensive Nissan.
