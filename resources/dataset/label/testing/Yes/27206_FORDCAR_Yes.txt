            If you're looking for a sporty car, but don't want to spend all your dough, take a look at the Ford Focus.  You'll love the way it handles, and you'll love the price even more.

I recently changed jobs, and in the process lost a company vehicle.  With one car for my wife and I to share, I found myself riding the bus more than I wanted to.  It was time to get another car.

My wife was totally against a new car and didn't think we could make the payments.  After many discussions, I was still on the bus.  If I wanted a new car, I was on my own.  

The easiest way to get another car was to get something my wife liked, and give it to her as a Christmas gift.  I get my old car back, and she gets a really cool present.  Everybody's happy!

I knew she liked the Ford Focus, but had never driven one, and hadn't heard much about them.  So, I swung by the local Ford dealer one afternoon just to look at them.  Well, the dealer talked me into driving a black ZX3.  

The ride was really impressive!  I was amazed at how quietly the car cruised down the highway - even at upwards of 90 mph.  I'd say I was set on buying the Focus in less than 5 minutes.

If you're looking for a small quality car go drive a Focus.  I guarantee you'll love it.
