            Hondas are notoruous for using their name like Nike.  If it's a Honda, it costs a lot of $$$.  Resale value holds as well.  This is actually a good thing unless you plan to drive your car to it's last few cranks.

Hondas are also known for their reliablity as well.  WIth the econo-model Civics, Honda do cut corners on making them memorable.  Features are there, but only if you are willing to ante up the dough.

As tested (or owned, I should say), a Civic EX with moonroof and cassette option (CD player standard), the price was $17,000.  Compared to a more featured-laden 2001 Nissan Sentra I purchased 3 years later, which was $16,500.

I was actually surprised at the econo-ness of the EX trim - the highest trim of their sedan.  Missing components like rear disc brakes and alloy wheels are unheard of!  However, it was parent's choice, and they get what then want.

<b>Styling</b>
The styling is very bland compared to last generation Civics.  The only thing that stood out was their new larger headlights.  Even this is getting old (but is still kept on the new generation Civic - 2001+ ).  Gone are the sleek curves, which are replaced by well placed lines and creases.  It is in every sense a normal looking compact.  Strangely, this generation of Civics looks larger than the last.

There is a weird quirk in our particular vehcile.  It seems that the hood latch is sqeeky, which initally gave us the impression that the body was not as solid and ridged as we hoped it to be.  This does not affect that, of course, but gave us a scare.  The squeek happens when you slam on the door, or drive normally.  Any disturbances will make it squeek.  So much for quality build, eh?  But that is the Only build quality issue we had, versues the numerous issues with the 2001 Sentra (I also owne).

<b>The Cabin</b>
The cabin is not very well insulated from the engine.  This gives it a racey feel, but the dash and center stack looks so ... well.... NOT.  The center stack looks displaced as it buldges out.  The climate controls have been moved towards the side, where the driver can easily reach - as long as he or she is used to the new position.  The stereo, however, is well placed thanks to the buldging cener stack.  This allows easy access to it without taking your eyes off the road.

Speaking of stereos, the standard CD-player is satisfactory if you are not an audiophile.  Turning the volume up loud distorts a bit, and at the same time, is NOT loud enough for those who care.  The stock setup does not provide much bass from the standard 4 speakers.  However, the front speakers are designed nicely - there is an opening upwards so you can actually hear YOUR side of the speaker as well as the opposing side.  I've noticed in many other cars (including my Sentra), the way the speaker is positioned in the front, you cannot hear your side of the speakers because it is either on the floor, or your leg is blocking it.

Cup holders are pretty useless without anything grabbing the cups.  Too many times have we had drinks spill courtesy of G-forces working against us in turns.

Seats are confortable in city and suburban driving.  A 30 mile drive will not kill you, but others have reported long road trips will.  Lateral support is very lacking.  The materials are very nice if felt by the hands.  However, it grips onto your clothes, giving you a wedgie in many occasions you decide to move the wrong way.

The driver seat gets manual 8-way seats, while the passenger side gets only the 4-way.  The driver has two knobs on the side for controlling frontal and rear heights, as well as the usual forward/backwards, and recliner.  The passengers has everything but the height adjustments.

Rear occupants will have to hope for small front passengers, as legroom is cramped with 6 footers in the front.  This is usual in many compact cars, however.  Truck space is pretty spaceous for this class.  You can tell from the outside as well.

With the clock on the stereo, it may be harder to see from the rear.  You can always ask the lucky people in the front what time it is.  :)

<b>Performance</b>
Even for a 4-speed automatic, this car feels deceptively powerful!  The 1.6 liter VTEC engine produces 127 HP and about 100 lb/ft of torque ... all in the higher ranges of the tachameter.  VTEC comes in at about 5000 RPMs, which makes it feel like you have a turbo kicking in at that RPM.  You can also hear it, as it sound like a sweet buzzing/roaring noise.

Downshifts are usually feels lagged, but are quicker than your average automatic car.  The transmission is not at all smooth, however.  Even when driving slowly (not reving it at all, but steadly have your foot touching the gas pedal), the tranny does NOT upshift unless it reaches 3000 RPMs.  This is very inefficent when just crusing, and gives it that very useasy feeling of wanting to upshift it yourself.  Once it hits 3000 RPMs, you can feel the car shifts up uneasily as it felt when you were crusing near the 3k mark.  Jerky!  In lower gears, when you let go of the gas, you can feel it, too!  The tranny does not let go, and you can feel the engine braking.  Not so with many other autos.  This "either on or off" feel makes for a great racing auto tranny, which seems a$$ backwards.  But if your parents can only drive an auto, and you have to drive the same car, this is the tranny for you AND them.

Handling is not as tight as I would like it to be, but surprising, the car can hold it's own weight in the corners.  Displaying a small amount of body roll, you can throw this car easily into an induced oversteer, altough it tends to want to understeer (very understandable, being an FF car with stock suspension settings).  Bumps are smoothed out in a very unsporty way.  A good compromise due to the double wishbone suspension.

Braking the car hard gives you confidence, as the car is very composed!  ABS does help alot in this situation.  However, it is a bit sensitive, as sometimes the ABS comes on during manuvers when it was not needed.  The brake does not grab too early, and does not grab too late.  It is very easy to modulate the brake to your needs and situation.  ABS saved us many a times in the winter, but annoyed us in the summer.  The expected feel of the car sliding sideways during drifts was taken away slightly by the feel of the pulsating brake pedal.  There is ALWAYS the fuse box. :)

<b>Value</b>
Although at the price tested, it came with ABS, many of the features we can't have made the price a little harder to swallow.  At a cheaper price, my Sentra came with 4-wheel disc brakes, a powerful premium stereo with sub woofer, fog lamps, and an overhead storage compartment ... all which were not even offered as options on the Civic EX.

However, if you are a Honda fantic, nothing will persuade you otherwise.  This is the car to get.  :)
