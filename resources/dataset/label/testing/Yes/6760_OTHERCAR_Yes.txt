            <b>MY STORY</b>
The BEST SUV Value on the market?  That's a steep claim, but I believe it whole-heartedly.  Here's my story.

As my 1998 Toyota RAV4 lease approached its end, I began gathering data on comparable vehicles.  I knew that I wanted another similarly-sized SUV.  I considered the following vehicles:

-Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute
-Toyota RAV4
-Toyota Highlander
-Subaru Forester
-Buick Rendevous
-Hyundai SantaFe

Don't let its looks fool you.  The Ford Escape was too small -- in the front and in the back.  Coupled with its pricing, I ceased considering it right away.

The RAV4 has the best mileage, but its cargo area is too small.  I wanted a larger vehicle this time, but not too large.

The Highlander, which was my first choice, just didn't fit into the budget.  It's an awesome vehicle though.  Its ride is extremely smooth and it is very comfortable.

The Forester seemed just a little too small.  The dealership I went to didn't help matters either.  The salesperson was very condescending and arrogant.

The Rendevous -- an extremely comfortable and attractive vehicle -- didn't fit into the budget either.

After 3-4 months of research, test drives and haggling, I was less than 1 month away from the end of my lease and didn't know what I was going to do.  

I was sitting at a red light one day, contemplating my next move when I saw a rather "different" SUV.  The size appeared perfect and it didn't look half bad.  It was familiar, but not familiar (if you know what I mean).  It was the Santa Fe.  I couldn't believe I had forgotten about that vehicle and marked my calendar to go and take a look.

<b>WHY I CHOSE THE SANTA FE</b>

Here's what I liked about the Santa Fe:

<b>Excellent Pricing</b>
The pricing on the Santa Fe is practically mind-boggling.  I paid $18,500 for a 4-cylinder vehicle laden with features (see below).  The only vehicles that came close in price were the RAV4 and the Forester, but they paled in comparison as far as the features were concerned, making the Santa a much better overall value.

<b>4-Speed Shiftronicï¿½ Automatic Transmission</b>
This is a nice "toy".  It's nice to choose between driving in manual or automatic, especially when I need a little more get-up-and go (my Santa Fe is a 4-cylinder).  This feature allows me to make that choice and its like driving a stick without having a clutch.

<b>Feature Laden</b>
For $18.5K this is what I got:
- 4 speaker AM/FM CD with tweeters (sounds awesome!)
- 3 sets of seatbelts in the rear
- front airbags
- rear privacy glass (tinted)
- power windows and locks
- keyless entry w/alarm
- cruise control
- center console
- overhead console with digital clock
- 16" alloy wheels
- 60/40 split folding reclining seats
- air conditioning
- power side mirrors w/defroster
- antenna in windshield
- roof rack
- over 70 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats down
- extremely good warranty that negated the need for an extended warranty

Many of these features were available on other vehicles, but at an additional cost.

My wife and I are extremely happy with this vehicle.  We actually used it to move to our new home.  The large cargo area in this vehicle saved us a ton of money.  If we had, say, a RAV4, we would have spent another $100-$200 on rental vans/trucks.

<b>REAR SEATS</b>

Oh!  I forgot to mention the back seats.  There seems to be as much leg room in the back as there is in the front.  There's lots of shoulder and hip room too.  There's even an arm rest in the middle and cup holders that extend out of the center console.

What a functional vehicle!  What comfort!  What a surprise!  I don't think we could have done better.
