            the jeep cherokee, any year, any model, is, by far, the best on the road. i have test driven many a SUV, and have found the jeep cherokee to be number one.
i was in the market for a new one,just to have a new car. at present time, i own a 1992 sport. my dilemma?....trading in my old one for a new one. the only problem i have with that, is i will start to have car payments.
my 1992 has 67,000 miles on it, and not a single, solitary thing wrong with it. the paint job is in fantastic condition, the engine is strong. 
so why do i want a new one. good question. i think i will keep the old one for as long as it runs.
the only problem i find with the old one, is that there are no cup holders.
least of my problems.
they made them great back then, and they continue to make them great at present.
A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!<br><br>
