            The 1993 Toyota Pickup 4x4 is a solid, reliable small pickup truck with just some minor problems.  I eventually traded it for my RAV4 (see my review on the RAV4) because I needed some more interior space.  I do however miss the truck and think it's a better looking, more solidly built truck than the Tacoma that replaced it.  I did quite a bit of research on the Tacoma and test drove an extended cab version but didn't like it as much as the 93 model.

Truck features:
 - 4x4 shift on the fly (but with manual wheel locks)
 - Standard cab
 - Bench seat
 - Manual transmission

PROS:  
I really liked the styling of the 93 model.  It didn't have the over-rounded look of the newer Tacoma, but wasn't boxy either.  I would describe it as simple, good looks.  The look of the 4x2 version didn't appeal to me as much as the 4x4 version.  The interior of the truck was simple with clean design.  The bench seat allowed me to squeeze 3 people in the cab when necessary.  It wasn't a fancy vehicle but it's not supposed to be...it's supposed to be a truck!

When in 4 wheel drive it drove quite well in the snow, but it would be advisable to keep some weight in the bed for better handling.  2 wheel drive was adequate for normal driving.

The best part of this truck was its incredible trade in value.  I bought the truck for $12,500 and had it for 3 years.  I got $10,000 trade for it on my RAV4 (and this was when the RAV4s were brand new so they weren't discounting them).  The dealer then resold the vehicle for $13,000!

CONS:
There were a few minor problems with the truck.  There was an occasional rattle in the cab which I was never able to identify.  I don't know if this is a chronic problem with the Toyota pickups, but mine had the problem.  Another problem with the truck was that the rear bumper started rusting prematurely.  Luckily Toyota has a great bumper to bumper warranty and replaced the bumper with no questions asked.  Toyota must have gotten a bad batch of bumpers in 93 because my friend's 93 Toyota 4Runner had the exact same problem (and had it replaced under warranty)

One of the reasons that I finally traded in my pickup was that I was driving it one day after it had just started raining.  I was merging onto a highway via a curved on-ramp (in 2 wheel drive).  I was obeying the speed limit and just as I was almost parallel with the highway I was merging onto, the rear of the truck spun out.  I ended up doing 3 180 degree spins back and forth as I tried to turn into each spin.  The truck finally ended up stalled in the middle of a 3-lane highway (good thing there was no traffic at the time).  Well that kind of scared me since the pickup was my only vehicle and it was unrealistic to always keep some weight in the bed of the pickup for traction.  So I decided to stay with the Toyota reliability and good styling and I bought a RAV4.

OVERALL:  I think the 93 model of the Toyota pickup is a great truck for a terrific price.
