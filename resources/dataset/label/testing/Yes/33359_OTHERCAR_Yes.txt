                 I have just recently purchased a 2000 Silver Jetta GLS with black leather interior and absolutely love it!  I just bought it last Friday and find myself just getting in the car and driving around for no reason but to be in my car.  When I first started looking at cars I really was not leaning toward the Jetta.  I was more interested in the 2000 Toyota Celica GT all based on looks.

     Basically I fell in love with the Jetta right when I went to take a look at it.  The Celica was no longer a thought in my head.  I was gung ho for the Jetta and began crunching numbers to see what I could afford.  As I looked into it I found that the Jetta is rather cheap for what you get.  The first one I saw on the lot was the one I wanted and ended up buying.  It was the GLS and had the leather package. The leather package includes:  heated front seats, leather steering wheel, leather seats, and heated washer nozzles.  I decided to have a 6-CD changer put in as well which I virtually got for nothing after talking the salesman down in price.

     The one thing I found out about the new Jetta is that it is totally consumer friendly.  For instance, I have the power windows on the car and they come with pinch protection.  This generally benefits people with small children because if their child happened to have their hand hanging out the window while it was closing, the window has a sensor to go back down so the child's arm doesn't get caught.  One other consumer friendly feature I like is the way the hood opens.  You don't get your hands all greasy and dirty anymore.  It has a latch that you pull toward you which I find to be a major plus.  There are many other consumer friendly features that come with this car and they are a big reason as to why I purchased this vehicle.

     I knew going into the deal that the dealership was not going to budge much on the price because I had heard that the Jetta basically sells itself, which was true for me.  As everyone knows car salesmen are tough to read.  You never want to believe them but they say everything with a straight face, so it's hard not to believe them.  All in all, when the 'wheeling and dealing' was done I felt I received a good deal.  I am very happy with the 2000 Jetta so far and have no complaints.  I would recommend taking a look at the new Jetta next time you are in the market for buying a car.  It is luxury at an inexpensive price!!
