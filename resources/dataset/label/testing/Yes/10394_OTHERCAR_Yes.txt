            I purchased a 1998 Kia Sephia Sedan in Sept. 1998. The reason I bought it was I have 2 friends who were previous Kia owners and they highly recommended the car to me...I was very impressed when I test drove my 98 (which has more interior room than previous models) In my opinion, it is a relatively inexpensive new car and I am very pleased with it so far..I have taken 2 long trips with the car and it is great on gas, very comfortable and very reliable transportation. I have had absolutely no complaints about it and have enjoyed it for the past 15 months, and would recommend it to anyone. Also, the dealership has been wonderful and very supportive. I have not had to have anything done to the car except routine maintenance so far, and would purchase one again...<br><br>
