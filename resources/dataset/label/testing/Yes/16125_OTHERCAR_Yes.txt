            After owning a couple of first generation SUVs in the early 80's then going to mini-vans to get through the kid years, I'm back in a SUV. After a great deal of research I selected the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  This is by far the finest SUV on the road today.  The ride is quiet and comfortable with plenty of room for passengers and cargo.  The interior comforts are on par with every high end SUV including Mercedes, Lexus and Infinity.  The 4 wheel drive system is effortless and the climate control is as driver friendly as it gets.  The Infinity sound system with 10 disk changer is fantastic!!  With all of that going for it, what really gets one hooked is the styling.  Driving this SUV on or off road is a true joy and anyone who wants the comfort of a large road sedan with the guts of a large 4x4, this is the vehicle for you.<br><br>
