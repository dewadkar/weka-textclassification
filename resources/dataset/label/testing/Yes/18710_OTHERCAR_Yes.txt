            I read BrianCam's review above and then at the end he mentions he doesn't own an LS.  I don't see how you can honestly review a car without owning one for a while.  So here's my review:

I've had my LS for a short time and I must say I LOVE IT.  It's a beautiful car.  It rides like a sports car with manners.  While you can feel the road, it never rattles your nerves with bumps or road imperfections.  

The 3.9 V-8 is smooth as silk, and provides lots of power.  It makes a beautiful sound when you reach the higher rpm levels.  Any car that can blast through the 1/4 mile in the low 15 second level is nicely powered.

The Alpine in dash 6 cd player sounds wonderful.  My home system doesn't sound this good.

The interior is gorgeous.  The wood trim steering wheel and shift knob make the interior look absolutely rich.  Everyone who's seen the car agrees the interior is just beautiful.  Reviewers who claim the interior isn't "luxurious" enough must have been driving a Rolls Royce prior to the LS.

Is the car perfect?  No.  I agree that the interior could use some more storage.  The console storage area is very small, the glove box is small, and the door pockets are small as well.  However, the trunk is huge, and that's where you should be keeping your junk, not cluttering up this lovely interior space.

My car's build quality is excellent, save for a slightly mis-aligned trunk lid.  I will mention this to the dealer to see if it can be adjusted.

All in all, a beautiful car that's a blast to drive.  If you're in this market, please give this car a test drive.
