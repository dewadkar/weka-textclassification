            we were in the market for a new vehicle. so we went shopping for a program car.. we bought this 1997 mercury sable $12,500.00 in October 1997 it had 26,000+ miles on it. so we still had enough warranty if anything went wrong. we have never had to bring it in. we have had it for over 2 years now. we still get 25 miles to the gallon. it still rides as smooth  as the day we bought  it. and my next car will most likely be a mercury sable. the only thing we have had to do is regular maintenance. yes. i would recommend of my friends. i think they are great.<br><br>
