            my car is a 2003 c230 kompressor coupe with 6sp man, c2 (panorama sunroof), c7 (sport pkg), and leather interior.  (the model year selector for this review only lets me choose up to 2002)

i live in the city of san francisco and commute about 90mi/day to my job by san jose.  i needed a car that was small and practical, but provided a level of comfort and fun for my long daily drives.  i looked at cars like the mini cooper s, vw golf gti, infiniti g35 coupe, and several others but chose this one in the end for several reasons.

despite the fact that it is the low end offering from mercedes benz and lacks a few features that are standard on higher models, the quality and luxury feel are definitely higher than other cars in it's class- especially the japanese imports.  even little details like the feel of the knobs, solid sound of the door shutting, and the metal center console seems a step up from many cars.  

the look of the car is sometimes controversial- people seem to either love it or hate it, but mercedes has created a nice package with this model.  the large panoramic sunroof is nice- giving the interior a really airy feel like a targa top.  the roof has a high profile so the rear seat passengers have decent headroom to go with the acceptable amount of legroom- rare in cars this size.  the large hatch opens high, allowing pretty large objects to be put in the back when you fold the seats down. 

for 2003, mb put in a new 1.8l dohc supercharged motor.  the power output is nearly the same but it runs smoother and quieter, while getting a few more mpg than the 2.3l.  the fat part of the torque curve comes in at a higher rpm on the 1.8l but it is still pretty decent once the supercharger builds up its pressure.  on a flat hwy cruising at around 80mph,  i can get over 30mpg.  the engine is fairly quiet at speed.  at lower speed, you mostly hear the supercharger whine- which is pretty a pretty interesting sound.

the car handles pretty solid on the highway.  at high speeds (over 80), the steering does feel a bit light so the slightest input can unexpectedly move the car too far.  since this is a mercedes, the suspension is set up to be more comfortable than sporty.  this was a slight disappointment to me, since i have the sport pkg which is mostly cosmetic except for the manual shifter having a 20% shorter throw and having 17" wheels with slightly better tires.  in cornering, there is a bit of body roll, due to the softer setup and the high center of gravity.  (this can be remedied with a swaybar swap from an amg c32.) 

the 6sp manual seemed pretty "mushy" to me when i first drove the car.  there seems to be a bit of play when it is in gear and it took me a while to learn what gear i am in by feel.  the shiftknob not being 100% tight seems to have been part of the problem, and it does feel a little better with an aftermarket knob on it.  also, the shift from 1st to 2nd has always been rough.  it feels as though it is getting smoother as i put more miles on it but i still find myself struggling with it at times.

i believe this is one of the few mercedes you can get with cloth interior and if you have a choice- get the leather.  i had the leather put in afterward by the dealer and it made a huge difference to the feel and look of the car.  the cloth was a bit too itchy for my taste and it had a bad 80's style techno pattern in it that seemed cheesy to me.  getting black leather really made the car seem more complete and adds to the perceived quality to the vehicle.  the seats are firm but feel very comfortable.  there should be more lateral support for a "sport" model but i am pretty happy with them in general.

i got the base stereo system- which is a am/fm cassette tied in with the optional cel phone.  although it is supposedly an alpine unit- the sound quality is poor- similar to a cheap delco in a gm rental car.  the speakers are actually quite nice.  i have installed an aftermarket head unit with the stock speakers and it sounds 2~3 times better.  if you want cd playback on the stock unit, you can add a cd changer in the glovebox with an optical link.  

as for quality- the car seems solid so far.  i have replaced a few things in the 3 months i have had it- a license plate lightbulb, cupholder, and car jack (a plastic piece on it broke off)  but those are minor quality control issues and were replaced by the dealer very easily.  i extended the 4yr/50k warranty to 5yr/100k but so far i have confidence that i won't be using it too much.  

the only 2 things i really do not like about the car:  the location of the window switches- which is annoyingly low by your left knee and you often times have to move your leg to find it.  the location of the wiper/turn signal stalk is directly behind the spoke of the steering wheel so i can never see it to read what setting i am using.  

because this is the entry level model here in the us, many of the features on other models are listed as options.  i prefer that because the car is cheaper and i can pick and choose which options i want instead of getting something fully loaded with extra stuff i don't need for a premium.  if you go nuts, you could probably add about $10k worth of options but even with the fairly basic car that i got, it is full of features and is just as nice or better that 2 previous cars i have owned in the same price range.
