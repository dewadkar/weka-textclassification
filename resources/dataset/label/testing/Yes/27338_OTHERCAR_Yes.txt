            My uncle and I had the pleasure of test-driving a Durango (he's in the market for an SUV), and we were both pleased with the usual Dodge-tough power from the 4.7 V8 under the hood.  While the Durango is not the most agile and powerful SUV in the market, it surely is impressive.  Based on the Dakota, a highly respectable compact truck, the Durango packs a lot into an appealing package.  THere are a plethora of benefits, including a nice interior and powerful hardware.  However, the service records of the Durango in Consumer Reports indicates the usual reliability in anything made by Chrysler.  Neither the Durango nor the Grand Cherokee are bulletproof, and while they are attractive, they just wouldn't be able to stand the extensive rigors of either a lot of on-road or off-road driving.  Chrysler transmissions tend to be iffy, and my freinds who own Chryslers have had a lot of bad luck (me included).  If one is just overwhelmingly attracted to the benefits the Durango has to offer and has a little money to throw around, go for it.  But I would just use the money for something a littel more reliable, like, say, a Honda.<br><br>
