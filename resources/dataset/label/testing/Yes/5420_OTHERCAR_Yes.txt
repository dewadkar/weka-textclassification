            I have owned my Canon Power Shot A5 Digital Camera for about a year now.  The Canon name has not disappointed me.  Not only is it reasonably priced, but it is nearly fool proof to use.  The auto focus and auto flash features assures that your pictures turn out properly.  

It is virtually What You See Is What You Get.

I have yet to have use the spare battery that comes with the camera.

It is very simple to use, but for the best results be sure to invest in really good photo software.  If your intention is to print your photos on a printer, you will need a top of the line color printer with high resolution for the best results.  I have also found it worthwhile to invest in the special photographic paper for final prints.

You can also download your photographs to disk and have them developed.<br><br>
