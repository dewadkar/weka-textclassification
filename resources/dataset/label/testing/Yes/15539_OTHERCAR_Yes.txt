            My 1995 Cutlass Supreme Convertible was getting a little long in the tooth and was ready for retirement. 

The Sebring Limited is certainly an eye-catcher. I went for a silver body with a soft, black top. 

The Limited trim level offers the following refinements:
  - Upgraded interior door trim w/ chrome handles.
  - Bright chrome 16" wheels.
  - Limited badge on the rear.
  - Front grille is body-color (instead of flat black)
  - AutoStick (Provides clutchless manual shifting on demand)
  - ABS-Plus with 4-wheel disc brakes.
  - White Electro-luminescent (indiglo) Gauges

These refinements, in my opinion, take the Sebring JXi convertible and put it over-the-top in appearance. Friends and associates have refered to it as a "Luxury Convertible" after a ride in the comfortable, leather-trimmed cabin.

As convertibles go, it is clear Chrysler intended this car to be a convertible from inception. The top seals tightly and easily, with ample, heavy-duty seals protecting against leaks. The top moves up and down rather quickly and the controls are well located. Though I have never had the top leak, the sealing around the tops of the windows is not particularly good. In the right cross-wind, you'll probably hear a little whistle. 

The Infinity cassette/CD system was designed very well for a factory system, providing ample power for most top-down driving. 

The engine is the 2.5l Mitsubishi V6 putting out 168 hp, and the car can go from 0 - 60 in 10 seconds. That's respectable and certainly falls into the category of "not bad." The car handles extremely well for its size hugging turns and generally feeling very nimble and responsive. It would be nice to have some more torque to pull out of the turns with, as it's really quite fun to drive.
