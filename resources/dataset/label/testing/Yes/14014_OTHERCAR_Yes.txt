            I purchased two Infiniti's in July 2002.  My I35 and G35 sedans are both are incredible cars. I considered a Q45 but decided to buy two for the price of one.  I could not have made a better choice.  I've had two previous Infiniti's and there is no better car on the road!  I keep coming back because of the EXCELLENT service.  When I have a scheduled appointment I just pull in the service bay and I'm greeted within seconds by name and I'm typically on my way in an Infiniti loan car in a matter of minutes.  My cars are always ready as promised and even the smallest of complaints are addressed correctly the first time!  I've never had that experience even with previous BMW's or Mercedes that I've owned. Another win for me!

The I35 is the best luxuary value for the dollar.  The 255hp engine purrs like a tiger and is always ready to leap.  I catch myself holding back on the throttle to keep from getting in trouble.  The interior is well appointed with beautiful leather and great fit and finish.  It offers easy to use steering wheel controls and I love the in-dash 6-CD changer.  I never realized how poorly I saw at night until I purchased these cars.  The standard low beam xenon headlights on the I35 and optional on the G35 really provide for much better night driving.  This is a fantastic safety feature that everyone should invest in!

I've had no issues with either of these cars all year, which is consistent with my previous purchases.  I'm confident that, if any issue arise, Infiniti will continue to do the exceptional job at exceeding my expectations.
