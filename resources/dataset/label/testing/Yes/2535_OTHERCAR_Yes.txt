            My husband and I looked at about all of the other minivans,test drove them all and read their warranties.  Clearly in our opinion the Pontiac Montana(1999) was the minivan for us.  On test drive it handled like a sportscar, not like you were pulling a wagon!  I'm only 5' tall and had problems seeing out of the Villager Estate minivan because of the placement of the windshield wipers and the Dodge Caravan was harder to get into.  The Pontiac Montana was a breeze from the beginning!!! We absolutely love it!! The kids are more than comfortable in their seats and my infants carseat is easy to install in the roomy seats and while I'm waiting for my older son to get out of school the aisle between the seats makes it easy to walk to the back seat to entertain the baby.  There are cupholders galore, you never have to ride with a drink between your knees!! The power sliding door is wonderful in getting kids inside quickly,you don't have to worry about pinched fingers.  This minivan isn't your typical boring minivan.  It looks as sporty as it drives!! With lots of space behind the back seats for lots of goodies in the extended wheel base model.  The radio controls are right at your fingertips on the steering wheel with the console controls glowing a soothing red at night.    With the automatic traction control I haven't slid once this winter (Iowa).    The air filter is wonderful for keeping pollutants out of the cabin and my son no longer sneezes when the heat/air are turned on.  My husband is almost 6' and he loves the seating inside also.  With electric driver seat controls this minivan is for everyone!!  Like the commercial says, 'Get out of Dodge country and into Montana!'- You won't regret it.       <br><br>
