            I bought the 2000 Neon looking for a dependable, American made, auto for commuting to and from work.  I work about 50 miles from my home and wanted a vehicle that gets good gas mileage.  The Neon is listed at 25-35mpg.  It gets much closer to 25mpg than 35mpg.  

I bought a fully loaded Silver Neon, with a 3 speed automatic transmission.  My ride to work is on a 2 lane highway with a 70 mph speed limit.  The car gets great acceleration, and runs fantastic at 70 mph, but  it feels like it needs an overdrive.  I think this would accomplish two things.  First, the car would get a little better gas mileage.  Second, it would run a little quieter and not be so jerky at the higher speed.

I have had the car for 6 months now and have noticed only one other minor problem.  The little button that turns on and off the light in the car when the door opens and closes is busted.  This minor item could have been better designed.

All this aside, the vehicle is a great car.  It has more guts than the other cars I test drove in it's class.  It is well put together, other than that door light button.

I would recommend this car for anyone who is looking for a small vehicle with a little pep.  There are compacts that get better gas mileage, but they don't have the horses.<br><br>
