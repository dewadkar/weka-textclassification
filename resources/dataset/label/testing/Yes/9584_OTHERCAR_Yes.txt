            When I first test-drove the new Celica, I had the opportunity to test drive a fully loaded automatic GT-S.  I instantly fell in love with it, with its rev-happy engine and awesome interior setup.  I figured the rear visibility was a big problem, but I'd get used to it. I was totally sold on the car, but when I sat down with the salesman, I came down to reality and had to settle for a GT.  The main reasons I got a GT was a $3000 price difference and better gas mileage. 

First let me state the positives of this vehicle.  This car is an absolute treat to look at.  From all angles, the car is beautiful, and this is probably the main reason I wanted this car so badly in the first place.  The interior was well-planned, with generous cup-holders, spacious CD jewel case storage on the center console, and intuitive gauges.  The fuel economy of this vehicle was spectacular, as the sticker on the car stated 36 MPG highway (2 better than the 2000 model).  The overall ride was a relatively silent one for a sport compact.  I didn't hear a single rattle while driving the car, nor was the engine overly loud at modest driving speeds.  The GT engine isn't going to wow any people at the tracks, but has some decent pickup at highway speeds which makes passing others an easy task.  The car handles like a dream.  For the price of this car, it has handling comparable to anything short of a low-end BMW.  Very tight and precise.

Now for the detractors of this car.  First thing I must say is, the rear visibility of this car is horrible.  If you're a rookie driver that doesn't know how to adjust side-view mirrors for blind spots or do some intuitive lane changing, do NOT get this car.  The spoiler gets in the way of judging the distance of the cars behind you that it can be guesswork at times.  Another peeve of mine was that some parts of the roof of the car feel like they're constructed out of cardboard.  The moonroof cover is a two piece that feels like two hard pieces of cardboard rubbing up on each other. The stock stereo system is adequate performance-wise, but it kills the overall appearance of a very nice interior with an unsightly LCD screen.  Leather is a necessity for this car.  The cloth seats that the Celica come with are unsightly and ugly.  Please don't make the same mistake I did.

This car should DEFINITELY not be bought as a first car.  This car's body seems to be relatively weak, so it'll be quite a hassle to take this car to the body shop to get it fixed, since all rookie drivers put dings and dents in their first car.  It, however should be bought by modestly-employed college students and people in their mid-20's who have owned a car previously.  The car is from a company reputable for their excellent reliability, and with this cars beautiful styling, you can't go wrong.
