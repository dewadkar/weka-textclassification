            My husband and I bought a new Chevy Astro van in 1989 after our third child was born. It has since been driven by every member of our family except that third child. Our van does not have all the extras, just lots and lots of room. The removable seats came in very handy when it came time to move to a new house, pop them out and it becomes a cargo van. 
     Maintenance is a very big part of how a vehicle is going to treat you. We made sure that all maintenance was kept up with and our van took very little money to keep on running. We put one new battery in that van in eleven years. Now I am sorry to say that after more than 170,000 miles our van is starting to make some not so good noises. Still I would go buy another Astro van if I still needed a van.
