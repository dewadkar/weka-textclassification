            My father has owned two Honda Accords now, and ever since I put my hands on the leather wrapped steering wheel, I have been finding ways to borrow this car.  &quot;I need a bigger car,&quot; I tell him and smile sweetly while the keys drop into my hand.  I jump into the driver's seat and just smile.  Driving this car is pure joy.  
I can find no complaints on our current 1999 Honda Accord.  It has an excellent sound system, accurate steering, and a sharp look. I feel like I'm floating when I drive this car.  It has plenty of room in the back and is great on long drives.  I actually enjoy driving when I am in this car.  
The Accord can be for anyone. Even a teenager would look good in this car. I feel very safe when I am inside it, because Honda is a name my family has trusted for several years. We will not buy anything else. 
When we shopped for our car we compared it to the camry and I must say that there is no comparision. The accord wins, hands down.<br><br>
