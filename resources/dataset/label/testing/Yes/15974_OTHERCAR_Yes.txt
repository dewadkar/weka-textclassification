            I must say that this is the nicest automobile I have ever owned and I love it; as much as one should love a car of course.  It does cost a lot; nearly $54000.00 for a 2 year old s320 w/9000 miles but it is worth it.($80000.00 for a 2000 model s420)   Obviously there are those that consider a car just a means to an end or unimportant and I could not argue with you... but, for those of us who consider the automobile an expression of our inner being, what makes us tick, our passion, the s-class is truly a work of art.  This car should not be sold on the merits of the technological but more on the spiritual.   Take the time to sit behind the wheel and grasp it and feel the firmness and the peace of mind that comes over you. From the solidness of construction which makes it hug the road to the nimble and responsive handling for even the most aggressive driver.  It is extremely quiet with the double glass standard on all s-class sedans.   The ergonomic seats with heat and the dual climate control make long trips tolerable. Safety is also a major concern that is properly addressed in the s-class and it has consistently ranked near the top as the safest car on the road. My car has the V-6 which offers ample power to compete with the average american sports car from the light.  Of course it turns heads out here in the midwest but that's not what motivates most buyers, at least not after they have actually owned one.  This car is truly a masterpiece.  So do yourself a favor and take the time to visit a dealer and actually take one out for a 10 minute drive to understand the love affair that many have enjoyed over the years with this car.  Don't envy the fortunate ones who have managed to acquire this passionate automobile but rather aspire to acquire one yourself through hard work , determination and the desire to succeed in life.  I praise the Lord I live in a country where those character qualities pay off and a person can enjoy the fruits of their labor in this fashion.  God Bless America!!! <br><br>
