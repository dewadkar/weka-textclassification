            I am not a professional or even a semi-professional photographer, so this review will be short and sweet.

If you are interested in more comprehensive reviews of this fabulous digital camera, I would suggest that you read some of the excellent ones here on Epinions or visit some of the more extensive websites such as dpreview.com which will provide you with an extremely detailed review if that is what it will take to convince you to buy this camera.

Before purchasing the G3, I owned the G2 and I was very happy with it. The G3 has added many improvements and a couple of "non-improvements" to the G2. I won't get into all the new specs because the professionals can explain it much better than I can. All I can say is that this camera is mind-bogling with all of its capabilities, and you don't have to be a pro to learn how to use all its features.
It takes superb, stunning photos.......period! And that's about all you need to know if you are as uneducated as I am in photography!

The two details that I wish Canon had not changed from the G2 are the terminal cover and the Zoombrowser software. The terminal cover on the G2 was a soft rubber flap which opened easily and swung to the side and out of the way of cable connectors. They replaced this with a hard plastic hinged door that is kind of flimsy and makes connecting cables very awkward.  The other item that Canon should have left alone was the Zoombrowser software. Except for the ability to download images faster than the old software, this new version is not as user-friendly. 

There are dozens of improvements to the G3 from the G2 that are praiseworthy and if you visit dpreview.com you will see them all. The bottom line is that this camera is worth every cent you pay and I don't think you can find another camera on the market with as many features and capabilities to produce near perfect photos in this price range.

I am anxiously waiting to see what Canon does with their next entry....the G4!
