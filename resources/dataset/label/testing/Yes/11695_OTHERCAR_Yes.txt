            I am the proud owner of a '97 Volkswagen GTI (2.0L 4 cyl 8V) that I've owned since new. This car is my fifth VW and my fourth GTI. 

I keep buying GTIs for several reasons. I believe the car is about as perfect a design as presently exists, for any amount of money. It conforms perfectly to my feelings about conserving energy, minimizing exterior dimensions and maximizing interior dimensions. I believe the car has the perfect performance to fuel economy ratio (though I must admit, I've got my eye on a 1.8T or VR-6). Presently I average 30mpg! While the car is not a barnstormer off the line, the torque curve seems to be remarkably flat; and once you get moving, believe me, this is the little engine that could! With 136,000 miles on the odometer, it continues to run like a top. 

Out of curiosity, I have been conforming only to the factory recommended 10,000 mile service interval- that's right, including oil and filter change! (So far, so good. I'll keep you posted.) In fact, the only problems to date, that are not wear and tear items, have been a bad starter motor at 60,000 miles, a bad air conditioner relay at 100,000 miles, and a rusty parking brake cable at 120,000 miles. The rear shocks went at 125,000 miles. ( That's pretty good, folks. ) The front struts are still original, as is the clutch!

The exhaust system was replaced at 100,000 miles. ( I drive in the New York City tri-state area. ) 

I would say my favorite thing about the car is the handling, especially its excellent straight-line stability and return to center. GTI owners will understand when I say: you don't really drive this car; you guide it around, effortlessly. When I drive other otherwise fine cars, I simply am not satisfied with the steering feel and stability. The steering ratio is quick; and the turning circle is tight. 

While the GTI's front end is tops, the rear is also great, keeping the tires firmly planted around bumpy curves. The ride actually improves as the load increases. The body structure is rock solid. 

The gearshift has a mechanical linkage in the four cylinder, with a reasonably precise, fairly short throw.

Four people feel perfectly comfortable in the GTI, front and back. There is plenty of head and leg room, with more head room in the back than in the Jetta. That's because the roof-line on the Golf and GTI goes farther back than the Jetta before sloping downward. Check it out. It's not rocket science! 

Finally, you have that incredible amount of cargo area with the seats folded. And this car will carry a maximum 1,067lb load! That's more load than a 2001 Acura 3.5 RL, Acura 3.2TL, BMW 3 series, BMW Z3, Buick Park Avenue, Buick Regal, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Corvette, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Prizm, Chevrolet Tracker, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler Concorde, Chrysler PT Cruiser, Daewoo Leganza, Daewoo Nubira, Dodge Intrepid, Dodge Neon, Ford Focus, GMC Jimmy, Honda Accord, Honda CR-V, Honda Insight, Honda Passport, Honda S2000, Infinity G20, Infinity I30, Isuzu Rodeo, Kia Sephia, Kia Sportage, Lexus ES300, Lexus GS300/GS430, Lexus RX300, Lincoln LS, Mazda 626, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Mazda Protege, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Mercury Cougar, Mitsubishi Diamante, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mitsubishi Galant, Mitsubishi Mirage, Nissan Altima, Nissan Maxima, Nissan Sentra, Nissan Xterra, Oldsmobile Alero, Oldsmobile Aurora, Oldsmobile Intrigue, Pontiac Bonneville, Pontiac Grand Am, Pontiac Grand Prix, Porsche Boxter, Saab 9-3, Saab 9-5, Saturn L-Series, Saturn S-Series, Subaru Forester, Subaru Legacy/Outback, Suzuki Vitara, Toyota Avalon, Toyota Camry, Toyota Camry Solara, Toyota Celica, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Echo, Toyota MR2 Spyder, Toyota Prius, Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Jetta, Volkswagen New Beetle, Volkswagen Passat, Volvo S40/V40, Volvo S80, and more! Thanks for reading that! Yes, you did read all those names correctly, including the Golf, the maximum load of which has dropped slightly for 2001. That's pretty amazing! Check it out. I got those specs from the Consumer Reports 2001 New Car Preview.    

Warning: this car is not testosterone-friendly. It's a sleeper- not known or appreciated by the general public. But that's OK. I feel like I know something that they don't. The car makes more sense to me than anything else on the road. It's a sporty utility vehicle.
