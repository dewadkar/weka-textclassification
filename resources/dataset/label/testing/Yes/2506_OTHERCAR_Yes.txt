            Purchased the vehicle for my wife (she found it at a local Jeep dealer lot) in late 1998 with approximately 34,000 miles on the odometer. It is the 4 X 2 model with a Grey Cloth Interior, Automatic Transmission, Power Windows, Power Locks, Cruise Control, Tilt Column, Power Mirrors, Fog Lamps, Rear Window Washer/Wiper, Rear Window Defroster, Intermittent Wipers, AM/FM/CD Player with 3-Band Equalizer and 6 Speakers. Exterior is white with black trim appointments and alloy wheels.

When purchased, we had everything checked out and fully serviced with all new belts, hoses, fluids, and tune-up. We now have over 90,000 miles on the vehicle with relatively little trouble trouble. It has never left us stranded. I did replace the water pump at about 75,000 miles (common), but this was a very easy task that I did myself. It is now on it's second set of spark plugs (I wanted the Bosch Platinum Plus 4 plugs) and I installed a K&N aftermarket air filter. We did use Slick 50 in the engine and use full-synthetic lubricants. The vehicle gets approximately 20 MPG for in-town driving and about 22 MPG on the highway on cruise control.

As far as the seats are concerned...other reviewers seem to dislike them, but my wife and I find them comfortable for up to 3 hours or so of driving. We are in our mid-forties and are at different ends of the physical spectrum. I am 6'4" 300 lbs. ex-collegiate wrestler; she is 5'0" 95 lbs. china doll-diminutive. The seats and interior suit us fine and we have owned Cadillacs, Toyotas, Lincolns, etc. When we travel on vacation with our two teenage sons, this is the vehicle we take!

The only noticeable problem is very prominent brake fade under hard (emergency) braking situations. Just when you need them most, they want to quit working properly. I had the rotors resurfaced and installed aftermarket high-performance brake pads that really helped the problem, but did not completely cure it. I suspect that the heat from the brake pads is being transferred through the caliper to the brake fluid and causing the heating and fading problems.

In conclusion, we expect to get 200,000 miles of relatively trouble free service from out Jeep. My wife loves the thing...that's all that really matters.
