            The Ford Focus Sedan gives you an affordable price with a Luxury feel.
Once you slip into the seat and take this car for a drive you will be amazed how fast you will fall in love with it.
The four door Sedan ZTS, offers so much standard options its hard to believe it can be bought at such a affordable price.

The driving experience is much different than that of the similar Sedans, the handling around corners and the shifting of gears are so smooth, The seats are comfortable, The control panel easy to read and there is enough room in the back for passengers to ride with comfort.

The design of the exterior is sleek and has a new appeal for the turn or the century.
Hopefully no changes will be made with the appearance in the near future as many compliments are given, even one from a owner of the new BMW who felt the exterior design was very close to his car.

The newest feature that impressed many women is the door handles on the outside of the car. The designer really gave them a lot of thought.
They are shaped so that a person wearing rings or long fingernail will
not scratch the paint. They are easy to open and are very comfortable in your hand.
Only fall back is the standard 3 year 36,000 mile Warranty with so many other cars offing as much as 5 and 7 year warranties now a days this limit should be increased to compete with the other competitors.

In simple words the new focus is the car of the century Very good choice
for design Ford!
