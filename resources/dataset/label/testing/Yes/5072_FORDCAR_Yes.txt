            **UPDATE**
we've now put over 3000 miles on the car and have a few updates and corrections to make;

<b>Handling</b>
The 'boatish' straightline handling and aggressive cornering manners wasn't a fluke, anomaly or caused by a long wheelbase.  All Gen3 SHO's are equipped with a feature called semi-active ride control or SARC.  It's an on the fly adjustment of the shock's damping rate regulated by ride height and body roll sensors and is wholly responsible for that nice Continental type of freewy ride and more than competent cornering ability for a 4700lb vehicle.

<b>Maintenance</b>
Just did our first oil change and was hocked to see the oil come out almost exactly the same color that it went it.  Honestly, it makes me a tad nervous as I'm used to at least some darkening from carbon and oxidation...  I guess this is what an all-aluminum V8 does with premium synthetic 5w-30.  The AC gives me fairly regular problems nowadays; the compressor cuts out completely when the car is warm, especially in stop and go or light to light traffic.  Only seems to happen when outside temp is above 95f though--too bad that's when I need it the most.  After reearching various SHO newsgroups, the problem could be either not enough refrigerant or a faulty low pressure switch.  Luckily, it's only a $14 part and shouldn't be that expensive to replace and recharge the system.  Cold and strong otherwise.

The front subframe bushings are wearing out causing an irritating clunking rattle over speedbumps.  The bushings on the endlinks to the front sway bar are doing the same.  To be expected at 131,754miles I guess.

Fuel milage varies between 14 and 19mpg a tank depending on the grade of fuel and who between me and my wife burns most of it.  Midgrade 89 octane seems to be the best compromise between cost and mileage.  Best mileage with 92, worst with 87--most likely due to the computer running the engine extra rich with low octane to prevent detonation.  Haven't tried or done the math yet to see if I'd be saving money and gaining mileage if I were to tank up on 87octane and use an octane boosting additive.  Runs fine on the cheap stuff otherwise, but the power delivery is noticeably more sluggish than higher octane most likely caused by the above mentioned rich condition.

<b>Interior fit & finish</b>
Overall, I'm very pleased with how things are holding up.  No knobs have broken off, there are absolutely *no* rattles or squeaks and it remains extremely quiet in the cabin with everything closed.  Stereo sytem continues to impress, and is getting exponentially better with modification to the stock components (email directly if intereted in details).  The only thing I can find that's loose or coming apart is trim moulding is pulling away from the frame around the sunroof where the sunscreen rubs on it and isn't noticeable unless you own the car.  Some 3M spray will probably take care of it for a few more years.

<b>Overall</b>
The car continues to surprise me in subtle ways and I can testify to the validity of the 144mph top speed.  0-60 is in the 'OK' category, 1/4mile times aren't anything amazingly special (except that it's a 4700# car going that quick).  The highway is where the car absolutely shines.  Comfortable adjustable seats, quiet cabin and gobs more power and speed 60-100 than almost everything outside the 2 seat sports car categoy.  Ford did an excellent job with this car and if the GL and SE models are in the same category of general fit and finish, then it makes sense why the Taurus has been so popular.  The SVT team breathed a little extra spark into it that propells it above 'family sedan' and solidly into Grand Touring territory.

**UPDATE**

I should probably start this review with a disclaimer of sorts; I've always secretly liked the SHO since it's inception, but's it's never been a car that I'd actively shop for or something that ever made me think "I gotta get me one of those".  I now feel pretty fortunate to have literally stumbled upon this car at a car dealership.  I am however, a huge fan of any car that can be deemed a 'sleeper' like Volvo850r's, ImapalaSS's or the new Marauder.  Whooping up on kiddie street racers with a grocery getter is just so entertaining.  Stop at a light with an accord on 20" wheels and a 4foot spoiler and you're expected to drag race at every stop light.  When a kid out trolling at the strip on weekends for CoolPoints, they soar w-a-y to the negative when you get shown up by a completely unassuming car.  

While I'm not exactly young, I'm not that old either and perceive the Taurus SHO as kindof the Buick Grand National of my generation.  A serious underdog that has a tremendously rabid fanbase since it's inception.  Everyone loves an underdog, and apparently motorheads like when cars that look like they are fast get beaten by cars that look like they don't.  While I'm not a huge fan of the 97's jellybean-ish styling, oval shaped center console and what looks like a Kotex MaxiPad spoiler on the rear decklid, there are several thing to reall like about this car.  There are a few things I wish were better, there's really not much fault in the car as it sits; it goes, stops and turns *alot* better than you would expect a full-size sedan to do, let alone a Ford Taurus.  Certainly alot better than I had expected.

<b>The Good</b>
The Engine.  Duh.  What else did you think I would pick as the first item to list on the Good list?!??  My first experience in an SHO was in a manual 5speed Gen1 model with the V6.  I remember being extremely impressed with launches in that car and amazed at how well Yamaha had put together the engine.  Very good 'normal' driving manners, plenty of torque to noodle in traffic and surprising punch when you wanted to get around it.  Whether or not that specific car just didn't handle well, or it was a trait of the earlier versions I'm not sure, but I do remember being underwhelmed by it's composure in the twisties.  It was definitely a 4door sedan, and other than a much larger herd of ponies under your right foot, it wasn't that different from any other psuedo-luxury domestic car of the period.  It was fun for the type of car it was but being single, in my early 20's and owning an 88 MustangLX that was practically a ProStreet car at the time, I never bothered to learn more about the car or follow the progress of the new models.  The few HO owners I'd met were all 30-somethings with kid(s) that seemed like they were holding on to some vestage of early adulthood by getting a car that appeased the minimum Spousal Approval Rating of a 4door with room for strollers and bags and also have a little bit of muscle so they wouldn't seem completely square when they went out with the boys.  That was then and now I'm probably exactly like those guys I came close to feeling sorry for.  Amazing how a decade changes perception.

The third generation SHO now sports a V8--surprise #1.  My car is equipped with a slush-o-matic (Spousal mandated), so it's hard to tell if there's a giant difference in HP or torque from my fuzzy half-interested memories of driving a V6 version.  Yet once again I was impressed almost to the point of amazement at how beefy the powerplant is.  Yamaha has got to be into some kind of industrial powerplants or something as well, 'cos it's almost inconcievable that a motorcycle company made a V8 this good.  Even Honda, who is a *much* larger company, produces mainly 4cylinder engines and had truckloads of both industrial and all forms of racing experience has yet to make anything bigger than 6 cylinders in large numbers...  

I didn't have all that high of expectations from the car at all.  It has almost 130k miles on it, and well, it a Ford sedan.  A company that's not really known for performance sedans other than the esoteric SHO.  The SVT has a great track record from turning out short production runs of bizzarre performance combinations, but still; it's a Taurus fer God's sake.  I assumed that as the SHO matured, Ford would sacrifice hp for mileage instead of going to an even larger engine with more HP.  Sign on the economy I guess.  Come to think of it, 97 nd 98 were both very good years for me as a Systems Engineer and network consultant so i guess it's not that odd that the emphasis went back to performance from economy mode the 80's left us in.  

Driving home from the dealership I was getting on the freeway with kindof a 'I wanna see what this car can do' attitude in the back of my mind.  It was in the back because both kids and the spouse were in the car, both parties are extremely effective at keeping the budding Andretti aspirations in check.  I entered the onramp already doing about 60 noting that the car was amazingly quiet.  I put my foot down a tad to get into the fast lane around slower traffinc that was exiting and kept it down probably a good 10sec longer than necessary.  I put the brake on, figuring 95 or so was fast enough when I glanced down at the speedo--135 -- Holy Cow!.  I was estimating speed from the wind and engine noise...according to my Plymouth Grand voyager tuned speddometer, I was doing maybe 70 judging by the sound of the car (or comparative lack therof), and the Taurus is alot quieter than our old minivan.  Surprise number two.  Not only did the car have well above average grunt out of the hole, but it kept on giving through the gears (strangely, there's only 3 but more on that later) and will more than likely use all of the 150mph speedo.  A well known interchange was coming up--I'd taken it quite a few times in my previous car, a 1995 CorradoVR6, that would get really entertaining around 70 or so on this interchange as the car would 'skip' on the expansion joints causing it to drift with all four wheels for about 20-30ft.  I took it at 85 with no squeal from the tires and the suspension tracked the expansion joints better than anything I'd run the interchange with before.  This probably has alot more to do with gross vehicle weight than a perfect suspension setup, but it was a very pleasant experience after leaving the lot with very low expectations.  There is very little body roll and the springs seems progressively wound in that you'll roll a bit untill the suspension 'sets' and then it's solid.  That was BIG surprise #4.  In a straight line though, the car almost feels 'boat-ish'.  Not quite like a Lincoln Continental, but it didn't feel all that far off.  That was the initial impression and it's still pretty much the same, only it has to do with the long wheelbase more than a cushy suspension like I originally thought.  The car rides on a set of factory 5spoke 16x6" wheels and shod with Michelin Symmetry 225/60/16's that I would highly recommend.  They give a very good ride due to the ralatively large sidewall, quiet on raingrooves, 35k+ miles and provide excellent traction with little sidewall flex as evidenced in hard cornering.  

The tranny is a defferent experience.  I had a hard time understanding why they chose a 3speed instead of a 4speed.  What this means is that the engine will rev to 5-6000rpms on a passing downshift instead of 4-5k.  Not necessarily a bad thing though, as the engine sounds good.  Although it doesn't sound like any other American V8, it's extremely quiet and smooth at idle and at conservative throttle usage.  Almost a whisper aftr hearing the phffffrrrrt of imports and the throaty growl of late model Firebirds and MustangCobras.  I've actually turned the starter with the engine running 3 times now--it's that quiet at idle.  

At WOT though, it makes a completely different song.  The most noticeable is the intake and valvetrain from the driver's seat (no wonder, you're about 10ft ahead of the exhaust), and the growl you get when the secondary runners open up will put a grin on your face.  Sounds go from kinda motorcycle-esque (no surprise), to an almost Ferrari-like note in the upper revs (probably wishful thinking, but hear for yourself).  I still don't really know what the exhaust note sounds like, since the wife drives like there's eggshells on the skinny pedal pulling away from the house.  Can't blame her though; I still haven't floored it from a standstill and doing so at any speed is startling when the tranny downshifts.  Mileage so far is just 'OK' and in the high teens to low 20's with mid-grade.  The last V8 I owned got *maybe* 6mpg, so I geuss that's pretty good.  I'm kinda bummed that I can't run the cheap stuff anymore, but I've read elsewhere on the web that the enginge detonates with low octane and the dash is marked "Premium Fuel Only", so I'm a bit weary about putting low octane in it.  Coming out of a van that got in the high 20's on the cheap stuff, it's kindof a bummer--but that's the price you pay for performance I suppose.  I also didn't realize how much I despised driving a minivan or SUV.  The engine so far has consumed no oil whatsoever and he just under 130,000 miles on the clock.

The interior was surprises 5 though 10...  There are *alot* of little details put into it that you wouldn't expect.  Cheezy little things like the ashtray and cup holder in the center console--they open slowly like those hydraulic computer case fronts...Not cheap spring loaded affairs like I've had in other cars.  The cup holder actually made the Wife squeal with delite when it opened for the first time and unfolded.  Dunno what she was expecting to come out of there, but apparently the result made her happy.  The one-touch drivers window is a feature that I'd missed since the Corrado and was very welcome (run through a couple toll booths on a regular basis and it's a godsend).  I wish though, that all the windows would close with this feature--I hate sitting for the extra 5 seconds rolling up the windows and sunroof.  Thoughtfully, the sunroof opens with the same one-touch action.  It also *fully* opens, meaning the glass retracts completely and pulls the sunshade all the way back with it.  Air over it is also just about silent until 60mph or so obliviating the need for an aftermarket sunroof visor unless you drive over 60 with the roof open for any length of time and really can't stand the wind noise (why have one then?).  

The stereo is kindof a good and bad thing.  This car came equipped with the MACH (no idea what it stands for) soundsystem instead of a Bose or whatever is the top of the line Delco flavor of the month.  It's not the top of the line for this car, but it is full featured; 6" drivers in the lower front doors, 2" drivers in the corner of the A pillars opposite the rear view mirrors and 5x7's in the rear deck.   The head unit puts out a good amount of power with a large (for an OEM) remote amplifier mounted in the trunk and includes an in-dash cassette and 6disc changer in the trunk.  Volume and clarity is also quite good, being fairly coherent at 70mph with the roof and front windows open.  There's also a fair amount of bass present as well, provided the vehicle is stopped.  there's just not enough power to provide any programming below 90Hz or so.  There's also not an appreciable amount of break up or clipping when the volume is cranked--it's probably still playing low, it's just not audible with a high level of background noise.  There is however a factory cutout for a 6x9 in the rear deck for an additional subwoofer that's probably included with the Bose setup.  

A/C is thankfully powerful, able to practically pelt you with ice pellets with the roof open and windows down in the Houston heat but at the cost of 3 or so miles per gallon.  Climate controls are integrated into the stereo face and have contrasting amber backlighting to the stereo controls' green making adjustments in darkness alot easier.  The automatic temperature settings also work very well with the outside temp guage providing endless amuzement as we drive around town.  The front seats are frankly, outstanding and adding yet another well-appreciated surprise to this list.  

Only the driver's seat is powered, but it's fully 8way adjustable with both easy to reach and easy to use controls.  there is also a power lumbar support (inflatable airback the supports your lower back) that makes long drives alot less tiring.  Beefy side bolsters round out the package, with Sparco racing seat shoulder wings for those really aggressive SCCA Solo sessions you know you won't be attending.  Only thing missing is leather, instead being upholstered in standard Ford cloth.  Back seat is a roomy, well padded 60/40 bench.  Legroom in the front and back is ample, although not that roomy in the back if either of the front seats are moved back very far.  There's about 5" or so clearance from the back of the front seats to the front of the rear with the driver's seat fully rearward.  There's not a whole lot of wind noise and no rattles or squeaks of any kind.  Impressive for a domestic car with over 100k miles on it.

The Bad
As much as the engine impresses, there's *always* a cost for performance.  While the Taurus is conssidered a fullsized car, or at least a larger midsize, it was not engineered with engine bay space in mind.  While the Yamaha V8 isn't a 455 Olds, it's not exactly a small package either.  About the only thing visible under an open hood is the 8 interlaced intake runners (looks pretty cool), and the front cover of the closest cylinder bank of the transverse 8.  The alternator is buried under the cylinder bank against the firewall, as is the powersteering and water pump.  The AC compressor is on the front of the engine, but again, very low.  Access to service this stuff is by removing the passenger wheel and McPhearson strut...not exactly a shadetree type of job.  Hope nothing major in an SHO's powertrain breaks either-very few of the parts are off the shelf Ford.  What gives the car well above average performance, also gives you hassles at the parts counter either with items not being in stock or costing 3x what a 'normal' Taurus would cost with the same problem.  Good tires for the car range from $100 to $150 and steering can be adversely affected by the wrong choice of shoes.  

While the car is very agile at carving corners for it's size, it's very skittish in a straight line.  Not sure if there's not enough castor in the steering geometry to stabilize straight lines or the bushings in the tie rods have worn, but it's a complaint I've red elsewhere as well.  Certain brands of tires also like to track raingrooves alot more than others as reported by other SHO owners leading me back to the belief that there's very little castor in the front end.  Once you point it in a direction, it willingly goes exctly where you want with confidence-inspiring stability--it just doesn't want to go arrow straight.  One of the front tires was a little low on airpressure when we left the lot having a dramatic affect on handling.  It's not overly touchy, just more like what you get with a sport compact rather than a grand touring machine.

Aesthetics.  Bad, bad, bad.  The reaar deck spoiler is almost silly.  I can't get the MaxiPad analogy out of my head--it's not so bad that I want to remove it or spend money replacing it, but it is probably the last thing I would have chose to put back there.  The car has a very well balanced quasi bodykit on it though.  Very understated affair that blends nicely with the rest of the car, particularly against LX or SE models.  Still, nothing striking as only another Taurus owner would tell the difference.  Or care to.  I'm very glad the headlight pods haven't glazed over to a yellow mess, but I was sad to see a dingy, not very well focused set of headlights.  I'm hoping a set of xenon bulbs will help, and light aiming adjustments are *very* well marked and easy to get to.  Thankfully, out of all the inaccessable parts of the engine, the air and oil filters are with reach, and the dipsticks are well-marked and accessable.  This relegates everything but cursory maintenance the job of a well-equipped mechanic.  It could have been alot worse.  Alot worse.

Don't plan on upgrading the stock stereo system either.  Ever.  Since the head unit is integrated with the environmental controls, it would take extensive fabrication (read extensive $$$) to replace.  The stock speaker system is also tough to upgrade, as the amplifier is integrated into the same box as the alarm/keyless entry.  Soundstage and overall imaging is poor due to the midrange drivers being both buried very low and deep into the doors as well as distant from the tweeters in the A pillars creating phase and time alignment problems if something was just dropped in as a replacement.  Adding a subwoofer is also problematic as well, as a standard line level converter would either unbalance the rears or require another amplifier to drive them.  Nothing that's impossible to overcome, but it's all something that requires additional planning and possibly additional dollars if it's replaced or upgraded.

<b>Conclusions & Delusions</b>
I'm still not convinced on exactly what demographic the average SHO buyer is and was.  I have no idea who the previous owner was other than a carfax report.  There's no glaring mechanical problems and the car was mechanically well cared for, but there are some cosmetic items that show signs of obvious reconditioning.  To be expected with this many miles I suppose.  I imagine the price point that these were at new, the average buyer was looking for all the amenities that it provides, but couldn't quite afford to get into a Lexus ES or GS, Mercedes or BMW, didn't want a 'gangster' Towncar or another boatish fullsize, but couldn't quite settle for a 'normal' type of car either.  

While the Taurus SHO commands very little if any prestige on the road, it will command at least a modicum of respect from those left at the light.  The facial expressions that range from bewilderment to anger that I get from late teen to early 20's guys driving butt-muffler equipped (phhfffffrrrrtt!) honda's with 4foot wings on the back as I effortlessly pull 4-5 car lengths from almost any speed in a car they had signed off as a typical Grocery Getter will be an endless source of amuzement, I'm sure.  Being able to pick where you want to merge on the freeway is another big plus.  The fact that it's quiet, comfortable and has almost all the amenities I want is gravy.

Even after 100k miles, it's still capable of hauling the family and gear around while simultaneously humiliating a teen Mustang driver.  How many cars built can say that?  Just pray nothing breaks in the powertrain....
