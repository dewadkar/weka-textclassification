            One day, I decided I needed a digital camera. I had my reasons. For one, I'm a graphic designer and need an easy way to get my photos and ideas into my computer. For two, I needed an easy fast way to take photos of items for my ebay auctions. So I started doing research. I wanted my camera to be able to do web ready pictures AND be able to print out photos that would look good with a higher resolution. I wanted my camera to come with an adapter. I wanted my camera to have a lot of unique features that I could use to make dynamic photographs. I wanted my camera to have a quality zoom. And most of all, I wanted my camera to be somewhat affordable (even though I knew it was gonna be a nice bill.) 
I started looking. I read all of the specs on the 30 cameras at Best Buy. I looked at the little photo sheets that showed pix by each camera. I liked the Kodak series. I REALLY liked everything to do with the Kodak 280. I had my mind set. I wanted to get it. Then I couldn't get a salesperson to help me. They just looked at me and walked away. A bit heartbroken and mad, I decided someone else could use my money and we went to Circuit City. I found the camera. Found a VERY helpful saleperson who knew what he was talking about and he got the sale. =) I must say it is the best money I've ever spent. This camera came with all the needed essentials including adapters for all different types of systems, memory card, batteries, and even rechargeable batteries and adapter! A quick read through the camera guide and I was ready to point click and shoot! The zoom is awesome and there is even a screen on the back to see the image before you take the photo. There are way too many features to name, and all of them are wonderful! From light compensation to sepia tone, this camera can work miracles! =) I HIGHLY recommend this camera. It has been worth every cent so far!<br><br>
