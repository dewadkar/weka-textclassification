            In our quest for a car that would be classy, comfortable and not too taxing on the budget, we met the Chevrolet Impala in Epcot, at Disney World, viewing new car presentations.  Hello gorgeous!  It was love at first sight.  My body embraced the seats which caressed the curves of my back.  I had to own this vehicle.

I test drove one in a strange autumn night-mist color, with all of the bells and whistles.  It was totally exciting.  I decided to chose one more compatible with my budget,  the standard Impala, which incidentally has a disc player and radio that asks you for your music preference, be it jazz, pop music or standard, then finds it for you.  How fun is that?

The ride is exceptional.  We took it on a 20 hour drive to Biloxi MS. and back. Smooth, relaxing, responsive, receiving excellent mileage for this 6 passenger car, spitting out 23-26 MPG from her 17 gallon tank.

A four-wheel independent suspension system assures you a quiet ride.  She sits upon large 16-inch wheels, the largest 4-wheel disc brakes in her class.  Lockout protection will not allow the power door locks to lock the driver's door, if the keys are still in the ignition.  (Another senior plus.)  A 12 volt power outlet provides power for your cell phone.  (more security).  Theater seats in the back allows excellent viewing for rear seat passengers.  Another security feature is the battery rundown protection.  Automatic shut off of courtesy lights after 20 minutes to prevent battery rundown.

After 3,000 miles and minimal, I hope, adjustments, I am delighted with my purchase.  It reminds me of the old Dinah Shore slogan, &quot; See the U. S. A. in your Chevrolet&quot;, just be sure it's an IMPALA.
