            If you've ever been waiting for the day to come when an auto manufacturer would actually build an automobile that is both rich and affordable that day has come.  Ladies and gentlemen that all new 2001 Aurora by Oldsmobile is everything a $100,000 dollar import is and more, while costing mush less than 1/2 of the price.  Ever since purchasing my Aurora I have not wanted to stay in the house for one day.  I want to take it every where and drive it every where.  The ride is absolutely fabulous and the acceleration for a car of this size is absolutely unbelievable.  It's rich leather interior with deep cushioned seats are just a dream to sit in.  You can practically spend hours on end in them and not get sore what so ever.  With it's wishbone suspension, numerous safety standards and countless standard amenities there is no reason to pass up this first class performer when shopping for next car.<br><br>
