            I bought this vehicle (a 1996 Passat GLX sedan) back in december of 1999. It had two previous owners AND had been wrecked once. Because of these things i was a bit hesitant to go for it, however, it was selling for 2/3 of book value (11K instead of 15.5K) so i went for it.

so far it has been a great deal, one of the best decisions i've ever made.  i LOVE the way it handles, like a sports car with the roominess of a sedan.  everything is so well thought out - those german engineers really have their heads on straight.  its like they actually sit in the car and think about what a driver/passenger would like and where they would like it.  even with the 8 months that i've owned this car i still find new conveniences that i never would have looked for on another car.

The VW VR6 engine is incredible - so tight and solid feeling, really puts you in your seat at mid-range rpms (on-ramps, etc.). rides beautifully on the highway... i actually look forward to long car trips now because of how comfortable they have become.

the only drawback to it for me is that i live in the south (chattanooga, Tennessee) and most mechanics still have no idea what to do with a VW... they look at like it's an alien spaceship and then order the wrong parts for it. for most people this won't be a problem if you live near a large city.  secondly, the parts are definitely more expensive than what you would pay for parts for an american or japanese vehicle.  you just can't get around this one - but for me, its worth it for the joy i get out of driving this car.  at the same time, VWs are generally easy to work on, and if you're not afraid of getting a little greasy, then you can do a great deal of the work yourself.  technical manuals abound for these cars.

all in all, two enthusiastic thumbs up!<br><br>
