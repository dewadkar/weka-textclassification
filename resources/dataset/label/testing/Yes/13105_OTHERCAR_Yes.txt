            Like past Hondas this is a great car.  The finish is top notch and the road handling is exceptional. The V6 model with 200Hp is very powerful. Great acceleration,  especially noticeable in passing speeds (60-100 mph) where you press the pedal and leave everyone else in the dust.  
As usual with Hondas the steering is perfect.  This car can do a U turn on a dime. Breaking and stability are also flawless.  Lots of room for a Coupe but still maintains a nice quick feel. In the V6 and EX models electric drivers seat provides lots of adjustments so that there is room even for a 6&quot;4 frame.  Lots of room in the trunk too.  Room in the back seat is good,  but 2 large adults would be happier up front on a long trip.  

Bought the vehicle because I wanted relatively powerful and fast car with good handling and I have had great past experiences with Honda. 
The EX model comes only with an moon roof which is great but reduces head room for tall people by about 2 inches.  However the LX V6 basically has most of the options from the EX except the Moon Roof / Leather seats / CD. So if you need head room,  the LX V6 is a wise choice, although I have to say, I miss the leather. But you can order that as an option on the LX too.
