            I have recently acquired this vehicle as a work vehicle.  It is a sound truck that is quieter and more comfortable than nearly any passenger vehicle I have owned. 

The cab is very roomy with the extended cab living up to my best expectations.  Passengers can sit comfortably inside without twisting their legs into pretzels.  

The truck has very good power, yet the two wheel drive option leaves something to be desired.  My vehicle is equipped with the G80 option, interlocking differential.  This is a great improvement for only a few hundred more dollars.  

A perspective buyer should note that the standard LS does not "sit" as high as most trucks. This can be a pro or a con- if you like to ride "high" then you might want to opt for a beefed up suspension.  However, the standard model is exceptionally easy to enter and exit as far as the amount of effort it takes goes.

The exterior is very sharp!  I have a white truck with grey interior.  It's a very nice combination style wise and the classiness of the interior isn't downgraded by grey.   Also the standard wheels and lights give the truck a look of power.

The interior is very stylish.  Some neat features are the compass / thermometer reading on the rear view mirror.  I am not one with directions, but having this to look at is helpful when trying to follow directions.  The radio also has a digital feature with lists the radio stations / song title and artists if the radio station is so equipped.  No longer will you be singing along with a song racking your brain about "Who is this band?"

The room between the front and back seat is good.  We have small children and you can easily pass a toy, book or cup to the back without over stretching, yet still not feel on top of one another.

My occupation has me off road much of the time in mining operations.  This vehicle handles the bumps well, and most wet and muddy conditions, although not fiercely. 

Overall, this is a great truck that looks good too!
It made me re-think my "Ford is he only way to go" attitude with out a doubt.
