            I purchased a new 1998 Sephia for my son to commute to school and his part time job.  I selected it because it was the best value in style, size, price, warranty and performance that I could find in a new car.

I searched the internet prior to deciding on a Kia.  The web site set up for consumer complaints was the most helpful.  The complaints were minor and most had a common theme.  They praised the gas mileage and the performance of the car.  The complaints did not demonstrate any serious flaw.

My son now has 16,000 miles on it.  On a recent trip to California, he got 42mpg on the interstate.  Around town it gets  30 mpg.

There was one warranty problem.  At 13,000 miles the brakes pulsated some.  The dealer put in new rotors and pads without any hassle.  I did wonder if the problem was caused when my son rotated the tires and didn't use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts. The problem started just after that.  Hmmm

I am 6'2&quot; and 260.  I find that I can ride in the rear seat with plenty of leg room and can get in and out with ease.

The car rides and handles well for a compact.  The acceleration is amazing for a l.8 liter with 125 hp.
