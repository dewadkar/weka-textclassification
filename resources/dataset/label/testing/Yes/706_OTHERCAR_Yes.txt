            As a previous owner of a Kodak DC-240 I have only excellent words to say about the Nikon Coolpix 950. 

The main reason to change my old Kodak DC-240 was that the photographs I was getting had some ugly pixelation that, some friends would agree, was unbearable. (If you read my review on the Kodak DC-240 you will understand in detail why I decided to change my camera)

I bought this camera for the great price of only $475 at Mobshop.com (with a 20% discount with some code I was given). First I was skeptic that the frequent rotation of the two pieces of the camera would lead to an early break, but after 4 months it is still working perfectly and no problems at all.

The main issue: No pixelation at all! My eyes are so thankful that the pictures have such a good quality that I have nothing but good things to say about the camera.

It uses Compact-Flash cards, that from my point of view are better than the others (but this is an issue for another epinion!).

Another nice feature is that when you watch through the visor, your nose does not touch the visor. Those of you Kodak DC-240 and 280 owners know how unfortunate that is.

So go ahead, this is a great camera!
