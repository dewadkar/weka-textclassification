            In the summer of 2000, when my '85 Chrysler New Yorker was costing more to keep running than it was worth, I started the discouraging process of trying to find a car that fit my budget and also fit my family. As a 5'4" female I can ride in anything. The problem is that I have 3 sons, the oldest is 6'2", weighs 240 lb., he will fit some cars, but my middle son was 6'4" and not yet 15 yrs. old, so still had growing to do (he is now 6'6"). There were no cars out there that he could ride in comfortably in the back seat, unless you went to a luxury size sedan, oops my budget problem again.

I didn't start out even looking at extended cab or quad cab trucks because I knew the GMC or Ford products were more than I wanted to spend for the options I would like to have.
After many days of test driving cars, we were at our local Dodge dealership and my oldest asked could we drive one of the Dakota Quad Cabs just because they were "fine" trucks.

We all fit. I didn't even have to sit in the back seat so that my two big boys could have the front for the leg and head room. They were fine with one in front and one in back.

When I checked the sticker price, it was only about $800 more than the Dodge Intrepid that we were looking at originally. The extras I got by buying the Dakota went way beyond the money difference. My oldest son was a high school senior and very involved in FFA activities which required pulling a trailer to various shows around the state. Previously we had to rely on other parents or the Ag. teachers to transport his animals and we would follow in the car. Now we had a great vehicle to haul everything and to ride in comfort on these long trips.

The interior with the back seats folded up has plenty of space for all the groceries it takes to feed the three boys as well as anything else I need to carry inside. With its 60/40 split, you can also fold up a section of the seat for cargo and still have someone ride in the back.

The model I got had everything except a CD player and I have since added a 10 CD changer which they installed under the back seat. The techs took the seat completely out to put the changer back far enough not to interfere with the seat laying down flat on the floor. Now there is no way for it to be stolen without the seat being removed. 

The only drawback I have found is that I am on my second set of tires, maybe that has to do with the teenage boys driving it. I seem to have a lot of black on the street in front of my house that wasn't there before. But I wouldn't trade the power of the Magnum V8 even though it does cause this truck to be a gas hog.
