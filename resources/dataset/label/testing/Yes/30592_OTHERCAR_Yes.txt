            We purchased a Kia Sportage EX 4x4 three years ago and have had only good experiences with it.  With the price of gasoline these days, the Kia has pretty good gas mileage. We've calculated it to be about 23mpg city driving and about 27 to 29 mpg highway.  We've had no major mechanical difficulties, except a dead battery that needed to be replaced this year. 
Handling is fair- it does not do particularly well on sharp turns and does not have the best pick-up. It handles sharp braking well and the ABS handles skids without difficulty.
Space is at a premium, compared to larger SUVs. It has about the same room as a midsize car. The back seats do fold down independently to allow for greater cargo space. We've travelled from Fla to NJ three times with two adults and a toddler and were able to take along all the necessities.
A couple minor complaints I have with the Kia is that the cupholders were obviously designed for different travel mugs than we use. Most cups we've put in the holders topple over.  Also, the rear spare tire gate opens to the side and I've scratched the paint more than once opening the rear door without securing the gate.  
Overall, I'd recommend the Kia Sportage as an inexpensive SUV.  We have the 4x4 package, but haven't needed to use it here in Florida!<br><br>
