            I bought my 1996 Dodge Ram 2500 4X4 extended cab with a diesel engine because my husband has a 1994 Dodge Ram 2500 4X4 diesel and he let me drive it once on a trip.  I went home and told him that he could either trade me for my van or buy me a truck like his.  Since he loved his truck, he opted for a his and hers situation.  We have children and the extended cab is great for a family of 5.  The car seat for the little one fits perfectly in the middle of the back seat.  The only drawbacks are that we do not have room to take any extra kids which sometimes is a blessing and the maintenance, if done right is rather expensive. 

I love everything about this truck, it is extremely comfortable to drive and ride in and gets around 23 mpg.  It is easy to maneuver, responsive and stable in every situation that I have been in.  Everything is easy to use and in easy reach of the driver, even the 4 wheel drive is a snap to engage.  I do mostly on road driving but have been in a few places where I have needed the 4 wheel drive and even in 4 wheel drive it is easy to steer.  I needed to practice with the anti-lock brakes but everyone who has them on their vehicle should learn the feel of them.

I had a canopy installed to haul groceries etc and that is a great asset to the truck. I also had wonderful service from Dodge and the dealer where I purchased the truck.   I would recommend a Dodge Ram Diesel truck to anyone that wanted the best truck money can buy and doesn't mind the sound of a diesel.<br><br>
