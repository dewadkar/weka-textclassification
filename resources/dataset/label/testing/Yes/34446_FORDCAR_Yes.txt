            I recently acquired a 1999 Ford F250 Superduty 2 wheel drive pickup with extended cab, and powerstroke engine.  Let me start by saying I have never liked the looks of the Ford Pickup trucks, until this one.  Traditionally I have been a Chevy truck man, and about 4 years ago had the Dodge Ram 1500 1995 model.  Both Chevy and Dodge make good trucks, however, this new Ford superduty series has taken the lead in my opinion for several reasons.  The looks and styling are much improved over Ford's tradional boxy, plain body styles of a couple years ago.  The other critical factor for many who own trucks is towing/hauling capablilites.  The engine is a key in this equation.  In the Superduty F250/F350 series an intercooled turbo diesel engine made by International/Navistar (Garrett/Allied Signal Turbocharger) is available.  This has tremendous torque and thanks to the turbo very respectable peppyiness/takeoff power for a large truck. Furthermore, unlike many diesels it is not very loud either standing outside by the truck or sitting in it.  I have the 6 speed manual transmission,  this has an ultralow gear which would be excellent for takeoffs with a heavy trailer.  Gas mileage was reported to me by the previous owner to be in the 18 mpg range.  The fuel tank is so large that I haven't emptied it yet to confirm this.   The extended cab with 4 doors is an excellent feature as well however the seat belts a somewhat hanging in the way and don't retract up when releasing them very well at all.  Another complaint, which generally applies to most all pickups but was very noticeable on this one, is that when the road is wet the back tires spin and slide a significant amount at takeoff.  This could be in part due to the high torque of the diesel engine and/or manual transmission (a combination which I've never owned before in a pickup).  This can be overcome by adding some weight (sand bags/concrete mix) in the truck bed.  Overall, this is a significant improvement in Ford's truck line and probably the finest diesel american full size truck available currently.  Other than a few minor complaints I can recommend this truck highly.<br><br>
