            This four-speed economy car has given me three years of good service in the San Francisco Bay Area since I purchased it used for $4,000 in March 1998.  The grey leather seats are firm and comfortable, it has a lot of pick-up, and low gas-mileage.  Styling was done deliberately by Toyota on a visit to BMW in Munich, Germany:  short stumpy rear and low-sloping front.  

My main complaints are visibility on rainy days, since both front and rear windows are so slow to defrost.  Secondly, there is no A/C, normally no biggie in the fog and wind of San Fran.  When it is a hot day, however, it's an oven, and windows must be open.  Then a lot of dirt sticks to the inside windows in a film that makes driving in sunlight semi-opaque.

If I do have to buy another zippety-doo-dah in the coming year, it will definitely have A/C. The cooling vent and fans do work but not enough.

My handsome grey leather seats are ripping, and so I've rigged some old blue sweaters over them to go with the decor.  I also hang a goofy orange Dreamcatcher from the inside rearview mirror and keep goofy hats in the backseat.  These are my local techniques to insure against any thieves in San Francisco getting interested in the contents of the car.  The original CD player gave out and I had a Blaupunkt cassette player installed 1.5 years ago, still pumping away.  For further disincentive to thieves, I play dopey 40's cowboy songs and Bulgarian hooters.

I normally only drive only one other person per trip and do not use the backseats.  It is admittedly very cramped back there, hard to get in and out,but small folks can do it.

It is a great car for parking in this city of insane parking laws and cramped spaces.

I did not even plan this purchase, but described to a cardealer/friend what I wanted:  it should be small, manual transmission, no electronic gadgets - as much mechanical as possible - e.g. windows; it should have a trunk to hide possessions.  Two-door was adequate, I told him, and no more than $5,000 was I willing to pay.

He came up with this one.  Misled into thinking I'd buy it on credit, reduced it to $4,000, which I then paid in full.  Since then, I have realized I got a real bargain.  

Timing belt I changed at 80K.  New tires at 110K.  It does drink a lot of oil.  It puts out white smoke when started up - but that's been for over two years and still running well.  

This baby will be driven into the grave.
