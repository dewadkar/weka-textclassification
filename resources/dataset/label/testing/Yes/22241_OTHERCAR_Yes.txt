            The BMW Z3 is one of the best small convertibles you can buy. While the standard model with a 2.0 Liter engine is a bit underpowered, the new 2.8 can push you comfortably into your seat when that little kick is required. The M Roadster is pure joy to drive, having the great handling, safety, and reliability of fine BMW engineering, plus the muscle and racing parts of the M company. This car is easy to drive, but you still know you're driving--the handling and suspension are smooth, and tight enough that you can still feel the road (which is one of the great attributes of BMW sports cars). While I don't suggest that you try it, the Z3 will very happily double the recommended speed limit on turns with little squeal and absolutely no sway. Compared to the &gt;$60,000 MSRP of a comparable Porsche Carrera, the ballpark $40,000 price tag of a Z3 is put into perspective a bit, and is certainly no cause for complaint. Perhaps its only negative attribute is its very small size and low weight, which can be a bit intimidating on a busy freeway, but makes it that much easier to maneuver through traffic. The Z3 is at home on an empty winding mountain road, where its strengths dominate.<br><br>
