            After a fair amount of research on digital cameras, and realizing the CoolPix 950 was out of my price range, I finally decided on the 700 and I've been very happy with it. The controls are easy to use, the on-camera functions and menus are straightforward, and the image quality is the best I've seen from any camera in this price range. The LCD is bright and sharp.

The cons:

It eats alkaline batteries quickly, as I hear all digicams do. However, I picked up two sets of rechargeable nickel-hydride batteries, and they last many times longer. With one set in the camera and the other in the charger I've been fine. I bought the AC adapter, but I haven't used it at all since getting the rechargeables.

Using the serial interface to transfer the images to my Mac was unacceptably slow, so I picked up a SCSI PCMCIA card reader. Pop the flash card from the camera into the reader and it mounts on the desktop like a disk. Copying the images this way is much faster, and I highly recommend it.

I sometimes find myself wishing for an optical zoom, despite the camera's 1600 x 1200 resolution.

I've spent a good portion of this review citing the camera's negative aspects, so I feel compelled to emphasize that I really like this camera. I'm very happy with it overall, and recommend it to anyone in need of a point-and-shoot digital camera.<br><br>
