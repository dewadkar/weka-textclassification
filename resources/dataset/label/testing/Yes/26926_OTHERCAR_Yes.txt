            I bought the Toyota Camry on impulse but when purchasing it, I knew that based on company reputation and sales volume it must have been a good car....Well, for the most part that is right.  I have owned my car for about 16 months and it has had 9 recalls on....Nothing the manufacturer has considered major mind you....Your lugnuts may fall off your tires causing your wheel to disengage increasing your risk of injury....Your steering wheel column bolt may fall off due to inappropriate tightening which could increase your risk of injury  (DUH!!!!), bad brakes, bad CD player, etc etc etc.

The one thing I will say about my Toyota Camry is that I drive it hard and it has yet to fail on me engine-wise...I have been so hacked off in traffic or because of a bad day and have gotten into my car and just driven it like a mad man and it's always performed in peak condition.  I have the 4 cylinder model and no one thinks that when they are inside.  The 4 cyclinder pumps out a very impress HP that makes most people think it's a 6 cyclinder engine.  Very strong and powerful for such a heavy car.

The ride is ultra-smooth, you feel like you are riding on air..It rides just like a luxury car and has very little noise or unstability in the comfort....

If you want a car that will last you forever regardless of how you drive or where you drive the Toyota Camry is definately one to purchase.  Out of all the 7 new cars I have had this one is at the top of the class...just be aware of those recalls that might increase your risk of injury....<br><br>
