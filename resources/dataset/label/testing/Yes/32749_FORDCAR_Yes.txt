            We bought our first Ford F-150 in 1990 when we lived back east. It was a V-6. When we moved out west we decided we needed one with more power, so in 1994 we traded that one in and bought another one but this time it was a 4X4 with a V-8. We wouldn't be without it. We have only had it in the shop twice. We have over 101,000 miles on it and it is still going strong. It is the toughest truck around in our eyes. We go places that most persons wouldn't even think of trying to attempt going. We have been on our so called roads that aren't even trails to most. We have been to the bottom of canyons and back up. We haul our little camper along with us where ever we go. To give you an idea on how rough the terrain is, I am constantly fixing and screwing our camper back together. We have never had any problems with our truck except the time I accidently shot it with my new 30.06 my husband bought me for elk hunting. I was checking out my safety and seeing how quiet it was to click off/on. Anyway, too long of a story to get into but thankful as we are our insurance covered it under explosion and it has been good to go ever since. The only $$ we seem to put in it is for tires. I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants a tough dependable truck.  <br><br>
