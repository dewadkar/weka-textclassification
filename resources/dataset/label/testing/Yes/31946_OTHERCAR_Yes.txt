            Just over a year ago I purchased two 2003 VW Jetta TDI's  basically the same except for color.  My wife and I drive them to work as we each work 30-40 miles from home in different directions.  We purchased the leather package in order to get the heated front seats.  

After putting 25k on one car and close to 35k on the other I can say that these are some great cars.  I tend to do more city driving in mine and as a result I get closer to 40miles/gallon.  My wife gets 50+ in hers most of the time.  If you are considering one of these cars and you live in an area that gets cold I highly recommend getting the leather package.  As I understand it that is the only way to get the heated seats.  A diesel engine runs at a lower temp then a gas engine so they take a lot longer to warm up if you just start it and wait.  it is actually better to start it and drive it quickly.  the heated seats in this situation really helps!!  on one trip my wife and I drove from newark Delaware to Massachusettes, and then back south of NY City on a single tank of gas.  We actually could have kept on going but we saw a great price for Diesel and decided to go ahead an fill up now.  These cars are great in that when the fuel light comes on you know you still have close to 100 miles to find more fuel.  can't do that in your average gas car!  

I was a bit concerned about this car originally.  mainly about it having enough power.  That concern was solved immediately by merely taking a test drive.  These little diesel engines really crank out the power.  Great Torque and a very smooth relatively flat power band.  I ride the Turnpike at @ 80MPH and am barely pushing 3000 RPM's.  

Now to the problems.  I have had several fairly minor issues that bear mentioning.  On receiving delivery of my car (december 2002) I quickly became aware of the fact that I had no heat by my feet.  At trip to the dealer and they had to take the car for 2 days and remove the dash board to get to the piece that was not positioned correctly.  Also I noticed a big difference between my car and my wife's in the heated seats.  I only got a small amount of heat at the top setting.  After complaining to the dealer and finally taking it to a second dealer they replaced the heat switches and it has worked fine ever since.  Also on my car I had to have the Turbo replaced @ 9 months into its life.  for some reason the waste gate had frozen in an open position.  It took the dealer 3 tries (replacing other parts each time) to fix this issue.  Not sure now if the other things they replaced needed to be replaced or not.  that is it for my car.  On my wife's car the ONLY issue we have had has been with the built in CD player.  after @ one month of use it broke.  it took VW 2 months to replace it and now a year later it is broken again.  I was told it would need to be pulled out and sent to VW to be repaired.  i will try a different dealer to try to get it fixed more seamlessley.  it is covered under warranty but would have been better if it had not broken in the first place!

over all these cars are both economical and FUN to drive.  Well worth the money and IMHO stylish too!
