            You're about to take a long ride on the life of the '94 V8 T-Bird. So buckle up and get ready to listen to some outstanding comments on the bird that loves to fly.

I recently purchased this car about 2 weeks ago.  I have liked the Thunderbirds since I was about 13.  My first car was a '88 Mustang LX 4 Cylinder, not the greatest car but it got me to where i needed to go.  All until the original transmission decided to slip.  That's when I decided to take my seat, as a loyal Ford fan, in the drivers seat of the t-bird.

I did my research on the birds from model year '88 until '97('94-'97 have the same body).  The sporty styling of the '94 really caught my eye.  As we all know, the three engines offered were the 3.8L V6, 3.8L V6(SC) and the 4.6L V8.  While inquiring with other mechanics about the engines I found out that both of the 3.8L's were horrible engines with nightmares of their own.  The main problems with both of the V6's was that of the head gaskets.  If you don't know about it, it is a major job to replace when they blow.  You basically need to rip apart the entire engine.  $2,000 later...you basically have a new head-gasket and about 30,000 miles later you're going to have another head-ache when the damn thing blows again.  Another problem with the basic 3.8L V6 is that it performs well in the Taurus but not in the T-Bird.  Due to the birds extreme weight of about 3900lb's, the engine has extreme lag, especially getting onto the highway.  It's not an engine I would trust with performance when you need to quickly outmaneuver someone on the highway or fly-by one of the big-rigs on the interstate.  The 3.8L V6(SC) has the same problems with the head-gasket blowing out, except it's only worse.  Ford didn't incorporate the amount of torque this 250HP V6 would put with the SC(super charger).  Thus in turn resulted in an even worse problem with the head-gasket.  The 3.8L V6(SC) is really only for someone with time and money on their hands.  It's definitely not suggested for the new 16 year old driver or the one who hates to stop at the gas station more that 5 times a week(depending on driving habbits.)

Now onto the beauty of the V8...this is obviously the choice for the one who likes to know they have power under their foot with knowing the head gasket isn't going to blow out.  I purchased my Moonlight Blue(E) with Palomino Blue(I) about 2 weeks ago.  When i test drove the car I knew it was what I needed. Being an 18 year old freshman college student i need space, sportiness, and the feel of power coming from the engine bay.  Consumer reports rates this V8 bird quite high in all standards.  Mechanically the car is an absolute dream.  Ford did an excellent job placing all of the spark plugs on TOP of the valve cover(good job Ford).  Although the radiator is made of plastic and aluminum, it does a great job holding up for itself.  As long as the proper maintenance is followed for the beast she'll hold up for you very well and won't overheat.  I have left the car idling for about 45 minutes and the fan comes on when it needs to and has not gone past 220 degrees.   My suggestion to you is don't be one of the slackers who fills the radiator with water ever few days.  Put the right solution of water/radiator fluid in so it know's you like doing the right thing.  As like any car, it needs its oil changes.  Ford states to do them every 5,000 miles, i like to keep to the 3,000 mile rule, especially in stop-and-go traffic.  Use only 5W-30 grade motor oil as Ford and most mechanics specify.  This car has quite a finesse while getting onto the expressways.  Merging and passing is no problem due to the amount of leverage still left in the throttle(even going 70MPH).   Going around corners and tight turns is no problem whatsoever.  Cornering in this car is an absolute dream, while so is the ride on the parkway.  This is a car that glides where it goes and grabs onto the road like a cat on a tree.  It refuses to let go underneath you.  I've seen that some people have a problem with the power in the rain and snow.  I've had both rain and snow where i live in the past 2 weeks and have had no problems with it slipping.  The people who say that are the ya-ya's who jam on the gas peddle expecting the car to grip solidly to 6 inches of snow.  Just give it a little gas and she'll get going for ya with no problem.  The only problem I have with this car mechanically is the downshift from 3-2 gear. It's not bad but you can feel it do it's thing, but consumer reports knows it's their too but doesn't rate it as a problem and neither do mechanics.  My only other complaint is getting the oil-filter off the bottom of the block. It's defintely not a job you can do in your back yard unless you have an 8' car lift in your garage.
The cockpit and inside of this car is an absolute dream world that the designers at Ford somehow came up with.  The instrument panel is clearly lit up with ALL gauges there, even the tachometer which a lot of cars dont' come with.  The vents, radio(premium Ford sound system is fantastic), and a/c panel is all in clear and perfect range for the driver's eye to take a quick glance at when driving.  Everything is perfectly faced toward the driver at a slight angle.  Arm rests are perfectly place for all passengers, even the rear seat riders have a pull out arm rest from the back seat.  The seats are the most comfortable seats i have ever been in.  You can live in the seats.  Plenty of room for the passenger and the driver has been fitted accordingly to all body shapes and sizes.  The tilt steering wheel is a great option to have, as is the 6 way power drivers' seat.  Dual airbag's help to greatly reduce the insurance price and increase both the drivers' and front passengers' safety.  The rear seat is increadibly roomy for even 3 passengers.  I have had no complaints from friends sitting back their which is quite a change for me going from the Mustang to the Thunderbird and people always complaining about the room in the Mustang.  There are 2 very small blind spots where the side view mirrors are aimed, but when checking your back to switch lanes you can clearly see out of both sides of the car without missing what's next to you.  The ride on the car is an absolute dream.  Outside sound is practically sealed out by the car's great insulation.  Due to the sport-tuned suspension, you can definitely feel the construction on your local thruway.  But as long as the asphalt is relatively flat then you will have no complaints.
The gas mileage on the V8 is absolutely fantastic for a V8.  I get about 18-20 miles just around town.  As long as you treat the gas pedal as though it's not one of your in-laws, then the gas mileage will treat you quite well.  The 18 gallon gas tank will take you on a plentiful trip without filling it up every few miles.  I would not at all suggest this car to a new driver who likes to get themselves wrapped around their towns trees every other week.  Even though I am 18 i treat my car with more respect than  i do with my friends half of the time. Maybe that's because i'm a part time mechanic.  I would greatly suggest this vehicle to anyone who loves the look of a sports car and the feel of a luxury car.  It's definitely an inexpensive piece of machinery that if you're a guy then the girls will love it.  If you're a girl then the guys will know you have a great taste in class, power, and sportiness.  

If you've survived this lecture on the '94 T-Bird 4.6L V8 then it's time for you to go out and get one.  Good luck and don't drive like an idiot.<br><br>
