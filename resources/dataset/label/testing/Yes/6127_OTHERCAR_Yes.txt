            I purchaced one in july on 2001, so far it has been the best car that i've ever owned!! I love the way it sounds when you take off from the stop, it roars and gets you off the line quick and smooth. I never hesitates, holds back, or runs rough. The 3.4 L V6 engine feels more like a V8! Living in San Antonio, Texas you can never tell what the weather will be in the winter, One morning it can be 20 degrees the next it will be 80 degrees! It starts all the time! The summers are not as wierd but their hard on cars (not the impala) recently the temperatures have been over 110 degrees starting at about 12 noon! I get in the car at 1 in the afternoon and it starts while it's out there in the sun! The humidity is always, always very high down here too but that's nothing to the Impala's fantastic paint job, no corosion or rusting! I'm still using the 400.00 Uniroyal tires it comes with and they are still handling and gripping the road as good as when I first got it. It's practacly maintenance free untill 100,000 miles on Spark Plugs, and coolant. It lets you know when it's time to change the oil thats great! Another thing is the room it has inside, You can fit 6 good sized adults/childeren comfortably! It doesn't have cheap material either like the Ford Taurus does! This material feels like suade, very high quality. The Delphi sound system is wonderful, 8 speakers gives out rich high bass sound and you here insturments that you never thoght were on the music. No wonder it cost 899.00 to buy it new. I like all the extras like:
Power seats
Power windows, locks
20 different messages in the message center
Remote keyless entry
Door Ajar / Trunk Open Warnings
Low windshield washer fluid warning
the locks lock as soon as you put the car into gear
and unlock as soon as the car it put out of gear (park)
Heated seats (don't ever need those down here in San Antonio
The head lights come on when it gets to a certain darkness
The sound system gives out song and artist, traffic and national emergency messages (RDS)
and so many more extras all put in the car without it looking cluttered, It looks very clean and sleek (sporty).
