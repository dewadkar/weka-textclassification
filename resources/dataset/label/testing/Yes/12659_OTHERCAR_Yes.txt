            Cadillac and Motor trend sponsored an interesting test drive weekend at Stone Mountain in Atlanta.

We signed up for a 2 hour slot.
We got to drive: 
* Caddys (Seville STS, DeVille DTS, Escalade, Catera)
* Lincolns (LS, Navigator)
* BMW 540ia
* MB C320, S430
* Lexus LS 430
* Jag Type S 3.0

They had set up four different courses with cones in a huge parking lot.
One of the courses had a skid area which was a large blue canvas with lots of soapy water.
Another had an off-road simulation with thick wooden beams and ropes strewn around for the 2 SUVs.

The longest lines were for the BMW 540 and the Jag.
The shortest lines were for the Lincolns.
Right off the bat the Jag was ahead in looks.
It really stood out from the crowd.

It was neither the most expensive car there nor the best performer (that was the Lexus). But it was the most enjoyable to drive.

My wife loved the minimal effort required to steer in the slalom (the Lexus was the only other car with such a soft feel to the steering).
I could easily do the slalom at good speed with one hand which was not the case with most other cars.
Since we only got a few min each in the Jag, we did not have time to admire the interior.
The only thing I remember about the interior were the soft and comfortable seats, great stereo, and lots of wood.

Punching the gas from a stop accelerated the car smoothly but did not have the same rush as the Lexus.
I think the 4.0 L v8 would fix that issue (the Lexus had a 4.3 L v8 so its probably not a fair comparison).

It handled the traction test admirably.
We had to enter the canvas, halt and turn the wheel a full circle to the right, and then punch the gas to see if the car would spin out.
I could not detect any loss of control when I performed this test.

We've seen used ones selling for under $40 K in the Atlanta area.
