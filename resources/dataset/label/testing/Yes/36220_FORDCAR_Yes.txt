            I purchased my Ford Focus in October 1999. Numerous people have approached me in parking lots, grocery stores, and at work regarding my car. They want to know my opinion of how it runs because they LOVE the way it looks!

The Focus has a totally new look. It is similar to the Volvo or Jetta look for a non V or J price. I purchased my Focus at Skyline Ford in Mesquite from salesman, Steve Sapp. I am a single parent, so price was definitely a factor. Not only did the Focus provide me with the right price range, but it also provided me with the right car payment. It gets excellent gas mileage, which is a big plus when you consider the price for gas these days. The Focus drives smoothly, and the sound system is wonderful.

I recommend the Focus to people with a small family, a high school student's first car, or for someone single on a budget. The Ford Focus gives you that luxury feel without that luxury price. If you want the prestige from having a car with a luxury price, then the Focus is not for you. For those who want an excellent ride, excellent gas mileage, excellent price, and a good sound while you coast along; the Ford Focus is the car for you!!!
