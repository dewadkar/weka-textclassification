            I was a bit doubtful, but I have taken gorgeous photos with this camera. It's easy and the fact you can plug it and shoot save the battery--(as well as dl the photos via the a/c).

You have to be careful with the flash which is good for taking pictures of the moon at night--I got one of the moon and venus. Inside with any kind of light, the flash whites out everything almost.

In bright sun, turn it to low resolution as it seems to be set to be extra bright. (I've posted photos I've taken at Photoloft.com as kaylar@soon.com so you can check the quality)
