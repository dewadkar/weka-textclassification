            No, I do not own a PT, but I am deeply considering getting one, so you'd better believe I've been doing my research!  The following are my thoughts based on the one time I sat in one and played with all of the neat buttons and features.

Chrysler has really outdone themselves on this.  This could be an excellent re-bound vehicle for them.  The base model comes loaded with fantastic standard features.  Just add ABS and an auto tranny, and you're heading for luxurious at $17K - $18K (MSRP).

The body design is fantastic.  The engineers down at DaimlerChrysler realized that people are still in love with the classic design of the '30s, '40s, and '50s.  It seems they've taken the best contours and designs from 3 decades and put them into a package that is not only pleasing as a &quot;sporty&quot; car but a family vehicle as well.

Previous to the release of the PT Cruiser, I was on the market for a minivan.  I needed a kid and load hauler.  I'm now considering a PT because of a) visual appeal, b)price, and c)great family features.

The fold down removable rear 35/65 split seat is a huge plus.  I am 5' tall and had little trouble removing the seat.  Chrysler claims that if you fold down the front passenger seat, you can haul an 8 foot ladder and close the hatch.  How's that for hauling space in a compact?

The center rear seat shoulder belt is a fantastic safety idea (something DaimlerChrysler is not known for) as well as optional side-impact air bags.

All seats are on platforms and there is tons of head room, even in the rear.  Even with the driver's seat almost all the way back, there was still a fair amount of leg room in the rear.  The seats, though a little stiff, were comfortable and didn't give me the &quot;dragging your butt on the ground&quot; feeling I thought I would have.

Will I order a PT?  I don't know.  I am in love with this car, but I have two car seats to put in the rear.  Even with it's sufficient interior design, I would be hard pressed to put a 3rd passenger between the child seats.  I would definately recommend that families with older children look into this car.  Not only will the kids be happy to look so &quot;cool,&quot; but I think this is the best wagon to ever hit the market.<br><br>
