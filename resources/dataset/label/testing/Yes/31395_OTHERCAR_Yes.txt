            My older sister is graduating this weekend as Validvictorian and there is nothing in this world that would make her happier than a new car.  My mom, dad, and I went to our nearby Oldsmobile dealers in search of an attractive fully-loaded Alero.  We had heard good things about them, so we decided to take a look at one a little closer.  As we were looking through the lot, our salesman reminded us that he had one more Alero on the showroom.  So far we hadn't seen anything that really caught our eye. As we walked into the showroom, our mouths dropped at the sight of the new 2000 Alero.  It had a special paint that is not offered on it regularly.  It also had leather,stereo/CD/cassette, and a matching spoiler with the performance package.  It was truly one of the most beautiful cars that I have seen in a long time.  I am a very big fan of large luxury cars and for this new compact Oldsmobile to basically stop my heart, it means that it is one fine looking car.  The engine is smooth and it handles great.   What else do you need?  I love this car with all my heart and I would do anything to see my sister drive it away to college.  She certainly deserves it.<br><br>
