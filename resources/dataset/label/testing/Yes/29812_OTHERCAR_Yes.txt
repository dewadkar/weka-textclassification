            The Kodak digital camera model 260 is what I found to be one of the easiest and most versatile cameras I have used today.  If you're someone who considers them self to be a novas this camera should be your number one choices for user friendliness.  This camera provided me with a whole lot of features such as a cool and up-to-date software package and three different ways to preview your pictures.  This product is excellent for on the road users who have laptops.  The camera came with via, PCMCIA card, USB, Parallel and video connections to view on your TV.  The software package came with Adobe software that allows you edit your pictures with ease.  The camera also came with software that would allow you to view your new pictures on a slide show right on your computer or TV.  All in all this camera is a perfect start for those people who are either novas or advanced users. This camera was my fist pick list because of vender reliability and reputation in the camera industry.  Did I mention that the cost was not that bad either.<br><br>
