            I bought a Mercury Villager in September 1998.  I had recently totaled my car and was in need of a vehicle ASAP.  My brother had a friend at the Mercury dealership, so I went there first.  I feel in-love with her almost instantly.  So, I decided to take her home.

Being only 29 years old, I felt a little strange in a new mini-van.  After a few weeks of driving her I could of thought of driving anything different.  This seven seater mini-van drove smoother than any of my past cars.  I always thought a van was a rough bouncy ride, but not this van.

I now have four children and my Villager is a Godsend.  I do have one or two small complaints about it, though.  I have received 2 recalls on it, so know I am starting to get a little nervous about its other problems she might possess.  Another thing is the structure of the middle seat.  It is a bench seat w/ 2 seatbelts.  Since I have two small children they are both in carseats.  Well, the larger toddler seat stay straight, but the infant carrier carseat DOES NOT stay straight up or sturdy.  It has a lock in base bottom and it never stays taunt.  I have to re-tighten it every time I get in the van.  Besides doing that, one must prop up a blanket to fill in the bucket-ness of the bench seat.

Although, I do have complaints about the Mercury Villager, I do recommend it.  I know in under a year I can use a toddler carseat so my major complaint will be gone.  I am telling you ... the smoothest ride ever.<br><br>
