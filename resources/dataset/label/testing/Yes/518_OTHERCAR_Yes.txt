            I spent a lot of time researching my camera purchase and was hesitant to buy a unit that was already "old" by today's standards.  However, the multitude of reviews you see for this camera are right, it is a great camera.

I don't know why Olympus hasn't updated this model with a higher megapixel model as this camera simply rocks.  The image stabilization makes all the difference in my experience.  I like the completely enclosed lens assembly and the size and weight are a small price to pay for the features and quality of the photos.  

I wanted a camera that would take good action photography so I could use it at my kid's soccer games.  This unit does that with ease.  You can go almost completely manual with this unit or you can use one of the 3 "program" modes, such as action photography, that work great.  I have not had good luck taking action photography at night (lighted fields, of course) but this may just be my inexperience with the manual settings.  Other than that one issue, I am greatly satisfied with this camera.

I may end up buying a more pocket sized camera as you're more likely to take it with you than this camera but this is "the" camera at my house.  I haven't used my expensive 35mm Chinon Genesis III SLR since I got this Olympus.  The Chinon is a great camera in it's own rite but I am completely satisfied with the digital experience with the C-2100.

You may want to invest in a photo printer that has separate color cartridges as you will want to print a lot of photographs when you see how easy it is to take good ones with the Olympus C-2100 camera.
