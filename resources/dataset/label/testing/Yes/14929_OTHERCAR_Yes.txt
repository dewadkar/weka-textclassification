            I bought my Sidekick a couple of weeks and 500 miles ago, and so far I love it. It's a basic kind of vehicle that I thought no company was ever going to build. If you are into the philosophy of &quot;basic, but solid&quot;, then this is the all-purpose vehicle for you.

It cruises at 75-80 mph on the highway. I can take it over the Sierra Mountains in the winter. And it's scheduled for lots of fishing and camping trips. Its cargo carrying capacity is great with the back seat folded down, and it can carry four people very comfortably. In short, it does all that I want it to do, and I love paying for gas with a single ten-dollar bill.

With the addition of an air-conditioning system, Cutie will be complete, and I will be completely satisfied. I look forward to many happy years together with this car that truly fits me. Thank you, Suzuki, for building a basic, but solid, vehicle.
