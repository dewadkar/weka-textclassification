            Firebird base prices range from $18,165 for the base V-6 model to $30,245 for my test Trans Am convertible, which has a power top with a glass window that quickly goes up and down. The rear-wheel drive Firebird has a tight interior for such a big, heavy car, but that's been the case with this auto since the early 1970s. A tall driver will find he can't move back far enough to get a comfortable distance from the steering wheel. And the front passenger must contend with a large floor bulge caused by a catalytic converter. The long, heavy doors are clumsy in tight parking spots and it's a chore climbing in and out of the back seat, which is best suited to children and small pets. Good luck getting past those front seatbelts while entering or leaving the rear. The Firebird Trans Am WS6 almost feels like a high-performance collector's car, which is no bad thing. It's far more refined and safer than 1960s muscle cars. Buying one makes more sense than getting, say, a 1960s Pontiac GTO convertible, which can cost more than the Trans Am convertible.
