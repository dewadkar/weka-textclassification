            We just bought a 2001 Honda Accord Sedan, 4 cylander LX.  We got it in September and ended up paying $17,200 after all was done, including all fees.  I don't know if that was the best deal or not, but it seemed like it at the time.  I had always wanted a honda myself since I was little but this is the first time I have actually bought one.  My husband was set on a Jetta but after I convinced him to just take a test drive of the Honda, he completely changed his mind, he became a honda lover also!  The interior of the 2001 model is much like the 2000.  The only thing markedly different is the addition of a standard cd player and 6 speakers, which by the way sound great.  The exterior is changed just a little bit also, most noticeable the lights in back, which don't appear so faded as the 2000 model.  The lines are a little sharper also and the front grill is slightly different.  The tires are 15&quot;.  We just got the studded tires put on today in preparation for the winter driving season, and I have to say that they handle remarkably well, much better than in previous cars where I felt a slight sluggishness and loss of sharpness in steering.  Although the car in only a V4, it is quite peppy and great at passing.  It also handles very well.  We bought it with a standard transmission, I am so tired of the acceration with automatics, like our last car!  Inside the car is very roomy, plenty of leg room, even in back. The trunk is very spacious also, it is great for luggage!  The three point car seat hook up is great in the back too, we have a little toddler and it works great with the front facing car seats (not the backwards facing ones though).  There is also a sunglass holder and nice cubby hole and storage compartments in front, great for storing cds and coins.  The only problem I have noticed so far is with the seatbealt on the drivers side, if you are not careful when you release, it hits the side door and leaves behind scratches which do not make me happy since it is a new car!  Other than that the car is a dream!  I would highly reccomend buying this car!<br><br>
