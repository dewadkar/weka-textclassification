            I have owned the DSC-S70 for 3 months and can attest to its outstanding performance. The camera produces excellent pictures in both indoor and outdoor environments. I have tested the camera in low light indoor situations and the flash does more than its job. Its easy to use navigational buttons provide easy access to all camera features while the USB connection provides for a quick and efficient transfer. The USB enables drag and drop file transfer for easy access to all your photos.

The only recommended accessory that is a must, is the 64MB Memory Stick that enables users to take about 74 - 1280 x 960 resolution photos. The quality at this resolution is superb, and that isn't even the highest setting (the highest setting is 2048 x 1536). The standard 8 MB memory stick provides only about 7 photos at the same resolution.

Overall, the Sony DSC-S70 has proven to be a very reliable camera time after time. To date, I have taken roughly 600 pictures without any problem at all. When it comes to still photos its as simple as point and shoot. The shutter has a slight delay that can prove difficult to use when taking action shots, even when set on the high shutter setting. Other than that, it is a great camera that comes with great features including date stamping, picture effects (sephia, solarize, black and white and negative), index viewing (very handy in large volume photo viewing) and the ability to create MPEG movies. 

The Carl Zeiss lens is remarkable in capturing true to life pictures and there is really no need for an extra battery since the Lion 7.2V 8.5Wh battery provides more than enough time taking pictures (with the LCD on) and viewing. This camera is definitely worth checking out on the Sony website since there are many other features that have not been mentioned.
