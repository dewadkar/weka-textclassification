            Powerful, comfortable, spacious, and beautiful are but four words that describe one of the best middle ranged cars out in the market. This car has it all: a V6 engine and plenty of leg room. Plus, its not like the Camry which every other household owns. The Avalon is only a little more expensive than the Camry yet has more power, more room, and better looks. Looks more like a luxury car than just a regular car. Driving this car is as simple as learning the alphabets. The wheel is very smooth and has great handle. The anti lock brakes work wonderfully and the car travels smoothly. You cant tell when the car switches gears no matter how hard you accelerate. This is a dream car. If you havent driven this car, go test drive it for yourself and see how wonderful it is. The only downer to this car is that it comes with a weak stereo. For those of you who love major bass, youre gonna have to spend some extra cash installing a new stereo system. Other than that, there are no other problems.<br><br>
