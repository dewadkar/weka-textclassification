            I drive a rebuilt, 1993, Toyota Tercel DX.  It is one of the most dependable, easily affordable, most comfortable cars (for a small car) that I have ever owned or driven.  

I love that the gas mileage is in the mid to high 20's in the CITY, not to mention on the highway!  I love that it's easy to work on and easy to maintain. 

It is a four door automobile with automatic transmission, cruise control, reaer window defrost, an/fm tape deck, and heat/ac.  This car is a great little value.

My only complaints have been that the seats wiggle a little front to back (both front seats do this), and that it burns a little oil on a regular basis (maybe a quart a month at most -- not a big deal).  My sister owns a 93 Tercel also, although it's a standard and has two doors.  It is NOT a rebuilt car, but it has those same two problems -- it burns oil at about the same rate, and the seats wiggle from front to back on their tracks.

All in all, however, this is a super little car -- very dependable, very comfortable to drive, has plenty of room for a small family and groceries and so forth.   I enjoy it.  

I would definitely be happy to own another Toyota.<br><br>
