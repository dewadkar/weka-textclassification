            We�ve owned our Rav4 for 2 years now.  Even though I bought it because I trust Toyota, I stupidly bought the warranty service.  Usually when you buy a new car you begin making a list of the things the dealer needs to fix.  You won�t be doing this with a Toyota.  Please don�t buy the warranty service.  It�s a waste of money.  (On American made cars, its smart)  So far, the only thing I can find wrong with it is that the cup holder in front won�t stay closed when not in use.  

It gets good gas mileage (a real plus nowadays), always starts right up even when you haven�t used it in weeks, and the seats are comfy.  But like all SUV�s the ride is hard.  Its probably best for just driving around town.  

But if you are looking for a car that won�t spend its life in the repair shop, this is for you.  Our Plymouth mini-van does just that (spends its life in the repair shop, that is), so I needed a car I could rely on while it was getting the other fixed.  

I bought it because I liked the fact that I can see better sitting up high.  In a regular sedan, I can�t see over the SUV�s and mini-vans.  We have owned several Toyotas and we have sure saved money on repairs.  <br><br>
