            We bought our 1999 Explorer three months ago as an extra vehicle that will last.  My husband and I both have reliable cars, but when the weather is bad here in the South you can't rely on snowplows and salt trucks to clear the roads.  We believe we still need to get to work, and our Explorer took care of doing just that over the last 3 weeks.  

It's a comfortable vehicle with the nice leather seats (we have the Edie Bauer Edition), roomy interior, and we love the control panel that lets us know how many miles to the gallon we get, the fuel level, oil level, windshield washer fluid level, etc.  There is plenty of room in the back seat for our 12-year-old to sit comfortably while the carseat for our 2-year-old is in the middle position.  

Our intent was to have a vehicle that would also be able to transport our dogs back and forth to the vet.  It's difficult with the carseat to fit the dogs in our 4-door vehicle.  The Explorer is so nice though, that now I don't want them in there!  

One negative I've noticed that made me uncomfortable is when I was driving on the highway on a extremely rainy day, I felt the vehicle moving from side to side much more than my car would under the same circumstances.  I just slowed down and it corrected the situation.  

I think anyone with kids, animals, and or loves the outdoors and likes to get to places that cars can't get to would like this vehicle.  I also like the secure feeling I get when I'm it since it's larger and I can see much more around me.<br><br>
