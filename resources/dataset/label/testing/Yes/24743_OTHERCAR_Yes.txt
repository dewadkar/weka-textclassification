            My wife and her friend recently started a candle/oil burner business and needed an (easy) way to take photos of their product for web and print catalog.  After going through several rolls of film, development and tedious scanning and cropping, I grabbed a digital camera magazine off the shelf, and visited several web sites for more information, opinions..etc.

I originally decided on the Olympus 3000, however, my local retailer of choice was out of them, and I did not want a display model.  

He pointed me to this Sony camera, and gave a very good reccomendation of it.  I kept pointing to my &quot;2nd choice&quot;, which was a Nikon, but he kept coming back to this Sony, pointing out the additional resolution, zoom strength, MPEG capability, and the Carl Zeiss lens.  

So, I purchased the DSC-S70 and set it up on the tripod and began taking pictures.  I was disappointed with the included 8MB flash card, and recently purchased a 64MB one.

It is a fantastic camera that takes outstanding pictures.  The clarity is amazing, even in low/un-even lighting conditions.  I have since ordered the optional flash, however for my specific needs.  The menu is very simple and intuitive, and outstanding results can be obtained out of the box with very little &quot;manual reading&quot;.  I would reccomend this to anyone, from the family to the photography &quot;professional&quot;.<br><br>
