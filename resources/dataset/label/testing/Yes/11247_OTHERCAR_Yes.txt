            The 1990 Chevrolet Celebrity is the most reliable car that you can buy for under $2500. Although the Celebrity is one of the cheapest cars you can find, I fail to see the reason why. 

A fully loaded Celebrity is marvelous, and I had one last for well over 190 000 miles until major problems began to surface. 

The fuel economy was great in my 4 cyl model, although the brakes were slightly light duty for the weight of the car that they were installed in. 

Overall, I never had any major complaints about the Celebrity, and any repairs were justified by the amount of miles it had on it. 

Considering a Ford Tempo is about the same price, you would avoid costly repairs and stress by choosing the Celebrity. <br><br>
