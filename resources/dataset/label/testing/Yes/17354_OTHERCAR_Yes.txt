            I purchased a black 2001 Accord EX-V6 used with 15K miles on it from a private seller. The car has been fantastic. The engine is a model of refinement and smoothness, the cabin is lush and very practically appointed, ergonomics are simple terrific. Absolutely no body fatigue even on 10  hr drives (I also ride a sportbike for that time duration so...),. It tracts extremly well on most road surfaces and curves. The ride is simply superlative. Fuel consumption is very reasonable given it's 200 hp engine. One of the reasons I bought this car was it's excellent motor. In terms of resaleability it is probably one of the few cars (along with the Toyota Corolla/Camry and the Honda Civic) that you simply can't go wrong with. I was lucky to get a sweet deal ($16750) from a private seller though most Dealers wanted $20000 for a similar car. 

The EX trim is very nice. Steering mounted audio controls could have been a little more comprehensive for this level of trim and price but that's just nit-picking.

It also looks really sharp with a rear spoiler, fog lights, a moonroof deflector and some tint glass.

This car is designed to last a lifetime (I've read reports of people using their Accords for 300000  miles).

I also own a Kia and can therefore probably can appreciate this car more.

You simply can't go wrong with this car.
