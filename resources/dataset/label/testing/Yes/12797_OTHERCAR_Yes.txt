            This camera was purchased to get those quick pictures of my child as he grows up.  The ability to look at the picture and store or delete is is a great asset.

If you are thinking about buying this camera to replace your 35mm camera, don't do it.  I do not think that is the purpose for this camera.  I think it meant as a compliment to your 35mm camera rather than a replacement.  At 3.3 mega pixels, I just haven't seen the quality that is ready to replace film.

Having said that, I absolutely love this camera.  We have a 1 year old that is prone to do that &quot;cute&quot; little thing at any given time.  You may or may not catch him at the right moment with the 35mm camera and you have to wait until the film is processed to know. With the Powershot S20 you can keep shooting and previewing until you are sure you have it.  On the computer the pictures look great.  Printed by an ink jet printer they look just O.K.

I found the controls on the camera a little cumbersome the first time, but after reading the manual (imagine that) the controls were actually quite simple. 

The camera is deceptively heavier than it looks, but not too heavy.  The LCD screen is rather small, but what do you want for a very compact camera?  I can still see all the necessary detail to make the &quot;save or delete&quot; decision.<br><br>
