            Are you considering getting into the SUV market, or are you thinking about moving up to something larger? If you answer yes to either question, you should really consider the Ford Expedition. I leased the '98 Eddie Bauer Expedition and can't stop talking about how great it is. The overall ride feels like your riding on air and the height that you sit at gives you a commanding view of the road, not to mention a feeling of security! The Eddie Bauer comes loaded with extras like fully automated front seats, heated front seats, cd changer in the middle console, rear air/heat and much more. The 4-wheel drive ain't bad in the Michigan winters either!

I've had this vehicle for about a year and a half with no major problems. I brought it back to the dealership 1 time because the back wiper quit working. Mechanically, it's very sound and I'm still amazed that I don't hear any rattles after owning this amount of time. I've got the larger of the two engines in this one and it doesn't take much to get it moving at highway speeds!

Now the down side...after owning mini-vans for the past ten years, I found that everything about the Expedition is more expensive. I felt like I got a good deal on the lease, and I would recommend finding a small leasing company to lease from as opposed to the standard dealership. I was able to get a much better deal. The gas mileage has averaged between 13 and 17 mpg and with the rising costs of gas lately, that can mean a $40 tank of gas! To be honest though, I'm so happy with the vehicle I look over that problem and can't imagine not owning one.

If you have a family of more than 3 children than this is a must, because of the third seat option. The kids can really spread out and have some room for themselves. To access the 3rd seat is a little awkward in the '98 model, because you have to flip the middle seat forward. It moves fairly easy but getting to the back seat isn't the easiest for an adult. The newer models changed the access by having the middle seat slide forward which should improve that.

All in all...it's a fantastic vehicle!<br><br>
