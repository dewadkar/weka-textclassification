            The Canon S10 is so small, convenient and fun to use it has quickly replaced my Canon Elan II as my camera of choice for casual snapshots. 
  
I researched many cameras online before choosing the Canon. I liked it's small size and the USB interface. I wanted a digital camera with at least 2 Megapixels, but that wasn't affordable until the new 3+ Megapixels came out recently. Also, I wanted a USB connection for fast and easy download to my computer. I did fail to factor in the cost of the rechargeable battery kit and the 48 meg memory card I decided to buy, though. That added almost another $200 to my outlay.

Now, for the good stuff. I recently went on a cruise to Mexico and took the S10 as well as my (much bulkier) SLR. Bottom line, I took 85 pictures with the S10 and only seven with the SLR. The S10 fit just fine in my tiny purse, which allowed me to take it anywhere. I never had to worry about running out of film or ruining film at airport security. I still had memory left on my 48 MB compactflash card at the end of the trip. Also, my little nephews loved being able to see the picture right after I took it on the small LCD screen.

<b>Most used features:</b> The S10 has an optical and digital zoom lens and multiple modes for picture taking including macro. You can set the white balance and choose to turn off the lcd screen to save batteries. It has a slideshow feature that will show all the pics you've taken. It has a tripod socket, timer and built in flash.

<b>Resolution modes:</b> small 800x600, medium 1280x960, large 1600x1200. In each resolution you can choose fine, medium or course compression. I download the photos into Photoshop, where they come in at 90 pixels per inch. You will have to bring the photos down to a manageable size from there. <i>Hint: Change the resolution to 72 ppi for online (email) display.</i> I love the instant access to my photos. I can email them, put them on Club Photo, or on eBay right away! Image quality and color are great, but you should be able to use some kind of photo editor. 
  
For me, the S10 was a great purchase. I only use my SLR when I know I want high quality prints. To get prints of my digital photos I can use EZprints or my own photo printer.
