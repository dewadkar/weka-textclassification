            Everyone should know by now is that Acura is manufacture by Honda. Honda is one of the popular brand in USA. The Honda product is really reliable and worry free and last. Acura is one class above Honda, I got a Acura Intergra 91 and I got 200,000 miles on it, I took care of it from the beginning, oil change on time and tunned up. I owned since 91 and haven't go to the shop once. My car still smooth and in good condition. I don't think any other domestic car can do that after 200,000 miles. Right now I own a Acura and Honda, and they both running really good. the good things about them both are: safe gas, reliable, easy to maintance, and worry free. I don't have much time to worry about my car cause of my work schedule. Honda and Acura really safe my life cause if they are both broke down I would be in big trouble. The design of the car is so sweet and clear and nice, really well design car, and easy to operate. I will definately buy another car from Honda or Acura again. cause I trust them and I know they will perform well agian, no matter what is the driving conditions are.<br><br>
