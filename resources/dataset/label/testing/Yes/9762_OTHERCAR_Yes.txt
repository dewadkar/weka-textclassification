            This vehicle is a tightly handling, visually beautiful piece of off-road machinery. I normally take it off-road in the Sierra Nevadas (last time was this winter) and was, once again, very impressed by its performance and this time I chose to write a review. The 4WD option on this and all 4WD models of the Rodeo (beginning from the 1998 models) is on-the-fly for the 4-high gear for any speed under 60 mph (100 km/h), and I have only used the 4-low gear once on a very slippery steep snowy climb, and even then it was just a precaution (it also worked beautifully in 4-high). 4 wheel ABS comes standard, as do driver and passenger airbags. The ride, even with the V6, is unusually quiet; so much so that my passengers were wondering whether I'd turned off the engine in mid-drive (sometimes I rev the engine just to make sure).

On the last trip I indiscriminately rammed into small trees (literally), huge puddles, crossed streams, and climbed over huge rocks, all with superb control and handling. We then threw a huge load of firewood in the car's cavernous cargo area. All the seats recline (including the back seats), and the back seats also come down completely flat to give you an even bigger cargo area. In fact, it was really cold on the second night so I put the seats down and slept in the back, which had plenty of room. The standard sound system, in my opinion, isn't anything to rave about but it's still a decent 6 speaker CD-capable system. The driver's seat in more comfortable than many I've sat in, but the rear passenger seats are more comfortable (I would prefer to drive from the back seat bar the obvious problems with this).

The 15-inch rim model has a full size spare tire underneath the cargo area (on the outside) and is very easily removed and installed. The 16-inch (LS) model has it on the back door. Speaking of the back door, it opens all the way out and locks into place so it won't close by itself on an incline.

I would recommend the five-speed version because its transmission, coupled with the already precise handling, gives you control that you wouldn't even expect from a street sedan.

Honda evidently was impressed by this car, since they put their name on it (the Honda Passport) and so have GM (their Frontera; and in the UK, the Vauxhall Frontera). These models are more expensive than most Rodeos because they are the LS models and above only. I've heard the engine being referred to as &quot;bulletproof&quot;. The V6 model has had a newly designed engine for the 1998 and later models that does away with a distributor cap and spark plugs, and instead the PCM computer controls the firing of each cylinder individually with its own coil. The V6 model has a 205 hp engine. The main competitor with the Rodeo is the Nissan Pathfinder.

The Rodeo is extremely reliable, and, outside of changing its oil and a washing it now and then, it hasn't said a word, and I treat it quite roughly.

I would recommend getting a front guard if you will be off-roading. Some trees and rocks can be more easily conquered with it. Fuel economy is, of course, the downside associated with all SUVs, and the Rodeo is no exception. Fuel economy varies with transmission type and engine size obviously, but mine hovers between 18 and 21, depending on driving conditions, and the figures are lower (I am not sure by how much) for 4WD operation.

Most people now who buy SUVs buy them for the same reasons they would buy a minivan, except they don't want the minivan's &quot;soccer mom&quot; look. SUVs look more rugged, and can afford the same space and sometimes luxury that any minivan can. But most SUVs I see on the streets are clean, shiny, and their all-terrain tires have never tasted dirt. The Rodeo is at home in all conditions.

To sum up, this car is one of the best buys in its class, and is definitely worth its price.<br><br>
