            Well, I finally decided to go out and buy a digital camera, and I didn't want to pay $500 or more for one. So, I checked out a few websites and some stores, and I choose to buy the <b>Kodak DX4330</b> (for $299) at Best Buy.

Here's my thoughts so far.....

--------------------

<b>FEATURES</b>

Of course, I wanted a digital camera with some good features (if I was going to replace my regular film camera with one), and the Kodak DX4330 was the right one for me.

The features that I most considered were:

- <i>3.1 Megapixel (2160 x 1440 pixels)</i>
This was one of the most important features to me as I wanted to ensure that I had a high enough resolution camera, so that I could enlarge my photos to at least 8x10 inches without any noticeable sacrifice in the quality of the photo. So far, I have printed out a few copies of my photos to 8x10 size on our printer at work, and I am very pleased with the quality of the photos even on regular paper. (NOTE: We are using a Ricoh AP3800CMF b/w & color printer/scanner/copier/fax at work which I would never, EVER be able to afford at home). If I was a serious photographer who needed this camera for work, I would've obviously looked for a higher megapixel camera, but for my own personal needs, this was just right.

- <i>10X Zoom (3x optical, 3.3X Advanced Digital)</i>
Having at least 3x optical zoom was another important feature for me as this relates to a 38-114mm lens (35 mm equivalent). Digital zoom is nice and all, but this is just a "software trick that crops photos to make it seem as though you're zooming in on an object."

- <i>1.8 inch review/preview color LCD</i>
Now, just about all digital cameras have an LCD screen to review/preview the photos that you have just taken. So, I just wanted to make sure that this LCD was at least big enough to be really functional and this 1.8 inch screen was.

- <i>Digital video/audio: Capture/Playback</i>
This is another feature that made me choose the Kodak DX4330 over others, the digital video. OK, the other digital cameras in this category had digital video capabilities, but the Kodak DX4330 also had a built-in speaker, so that you can replay your video with audio as well (without plugging it into your VCR or TV).

- <i>16 MB Internal Memory</i>
Without memory, I couldn't take any photos or video without buying a memory card, and with Kodak's internal memory I was all ready to use my camera.



Some of the other features of this camera include:

- Multi scene modes: auto, sport, night, landscape, close-up, movie
- Auto orientation: On-camera picture rotation
- Matrix metering
- Expansion slot for <b>BOTH</b> a MMC or SD card
- Focusing range: 2ft/0.60 m to infinity
- Optical viewfinder
- Flash: Built-in (auto, fill, red-eye, off)
- File Transfer: USB
- Self-Timer: 10 seconds
- Date Stamp: User selectable
- Tripod Mount
- Video out (NTSC or PAL)
- Compatible with the Kodak EasyShare camera dock

<b>CONTENTS</b>

The contents of the Kodak DX4330 package includes:

- Kodak DX4330 camera with wrist strap and lens cap
- CD-ROM with Kodak EasyShare software

- Insert for optional Kodak EasyShare camera dock

--------------------

<b>DRAWBACKS</b>

Even though I am very happy to have purchased the Kodak DX4330, there are still a few things I should mention:

1. POWER - OK, I'm glad that they included a CRV3 Lithium Battery that lasts a LOT longer than regular batteries. However, this is a "use it once and throw it away" kind of battery, so it is not rechargeable. So, I would need to purchase separately some Lithium AA, Ni-MH AA, or another CRV3 once the initial CRV3 died. Now, why didn't Kodak just supply you with the rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries in the first place (with or without a charger)? Or why didn't they at least provide you with the AC adapter (which you can buy separately) like just about every other electronic gadget that you buy includes nowadays?

2. LCD - Yes, the LCD is great to use, so that you can easily take pictures without looking through those small viewfinders. However, you can only effectively use the LCD screen to preview the photos that you are about to take or the video that you are about to record during the daytime or in places where there is lots of light available. I tried to use the LCD screen at nighttime in our home to take some photos, but I could not make out what was on the LCD screen as it was too dark. Mind you, I do not live in a cave with just candle light, so there was ample light.....just not enough to use the LCD screen. So, I just have to use the viewfinder during those occasions which isn't too bad except for the fact that the green "ready light" shines in your eye when you look through the viewfinder.

--------------------

<b>OVERALL</b>

Alright, even with the two drawbacks shown above, I still love using this camera. Technology has definitely made my life easier, and this camera is proof of it.
