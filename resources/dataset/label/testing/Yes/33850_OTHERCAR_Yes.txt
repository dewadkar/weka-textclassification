            I got this car (used) just prior to Christmas. It was a '98 and jet black.
I got the Ultra  pkg w/most of the goodies. I have put  6K miles on it since and its great. Smooth, reliable, even good looking. I teach h/s  kids and they say its a pretty car. A Park Avenue! They  have good taste.
I got out of V8 Explorer, just as gas prices began to nudge up, now I'm glad I'm out of that gas hog. I can zoom  to 60mph in 7 sec flat, cruise the interstate like floating on air, handle the twisties better  than any car its size and get 25 mpg to boot. Anyone  who wants a stout car that looks good and can comfort you like any Lexus for 1/2 the $ should get one of these. Forget what you think/know about  Buicks-these  one is great. There are more chic cars/trucks to be seen in, but you can lean back in the big, comfy seats and know you've made a wise choice.  I wished  I could have found one w/a sunroof/and CD stacker. Well, so is life.<br><br>
