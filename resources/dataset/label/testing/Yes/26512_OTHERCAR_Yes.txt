            I really enjoy driving the Chevy S-10 pickup truck.  The model I have driven is a 1992, so it is getting a bit old but it is hanging on strong.  There have been very few maintenance problems with this car even though it has over 100,000 miles on it.  I enjoy the comfort of this car, however i think anyone with very long legs might have a bit of a problem.  The Chevy S-10 that I drive has an extended cab, but no seats in the cab.  I think this is a great feature because it allows for storage space on rainy days.  I have never driven a truck before this one, and i enjoy the way a truck drive, how it handles and the space that it provides.  <br><br>
