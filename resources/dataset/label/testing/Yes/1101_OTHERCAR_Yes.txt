            My parents bought me the Fox in 1993.  The original owners wanted $6000, but we got them down to $4000; I am still driving it, having taken it from MI to WA, down to CA, and back across the country to IL, and it has had no major malfunctions (read below).  I would say that even if I had paid the original asking price for this car I would have still gotten my money's worth.

Right from the start the car made a great impression on me.  I left it for 3 weeks in the winter in MI.  When I returned I spent an hour or two digging the car out.  I put the key in the ignition, and it started at first try.  And that's how it has been ever since.

So far I've had only regular wear &amp; tear related visits to the mechanic (as well as some user-error problems).  Here is an itemized list of every major trip to the mechanic since I bought the car:

1) After a long wet stay of 3 years in Seattle and a move to Illinois the muffler pipe rusted and needed to be replaced.

2) The original equipment battery gave out last winter (1999).

3) Original equipment belts were beginning to crack and so I replaced them in 1996.  I was told by my mechanic that this replacement was not urgent.  He said that in a Fox, if the belts do break, the car will stop (of course) but there will be no major damage to the engine.  (I'm not saying one should wait for things to break).

4) My electrical system had a short which was a direct result from me trying to use the car as a submarine.  Two years ago I went through a flooded underpass (maybe 2 feet or so deep in water).  There were stalled cars in the water that tried to pass but didn't.  But I could see no other choiceï¿½ so I went through, and was very happy to come out the other side.  Did I mention that most cars stalled?  Basically, my car and SUV's were the only ones who made it to the other side.

5) The alignment was messed up after driving over a particularly large rock.

6) I wore off my brake pads way back before I knew there was such a thing (that needed looking after).  That was pricey to fix.

That's it.  I've not had one malfunction that was not directly related to my stupidity or regular wear &amp; tear (or, as you can see in item 6, a combination of both).

Other than the above I've had to fix some VERY minor items (lock, visor, window handle, lights, window wipers).  By the way, this may be my only concern with my car:  these minor parts are more expensive for my car than they are for Toyotas or Hondas or Fords.  I remember the window handle for my car was about $20, while the same part for a Honda was about $6.

I was told by my mechanic in Seattle that as long as I kept all the fluids filled, and changed the oil every 3 months (as one is supposed to, without skipping), the car will run to 300,000.  I don't doubt it for a minute.  It also gets amazing mileage (38 miles/gallon on highway; close to 30 in the city; a bit less than that in hilly Seattle).

The car is, however, rather small, and not too powerful.  It is also ALL manual.  Personally, I love the fact that it's manual.  After every time I drive someone else's car with power brakes and power steering and power windows and what-not, I'm so glad to get back into my own car where I feel I control everything.  To me my car handles much better than anything automatic, but I'm certain that this has to do with being used to my car more than anything else.

I absolutely love this car, and plan to drive it as long as possible.  When the time comes to get a new one I will get something similar, but a little more powerful.  I'm pretty sure I will go for a VW Jetta.  And I only hope that it is as reliable and sturdy as my Fox.<br><br>
