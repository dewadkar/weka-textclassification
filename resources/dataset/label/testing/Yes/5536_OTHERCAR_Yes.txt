             Our family owns a 1997 chevy tahoe and it is great for just about anything. We take the truck for family trips and just everday driving. It has plenty of cargo room and it is a very good automobile for the winter. It can also come very equipt ours has a leather interior and even a cd player. One of my favorite features is the manual 4 wheel drive. When normally you would get stuck in a ditch you can manually switch the vehicle into four wheel drive, and the truck will get out of the ditch easily. We love ours so much that we plan on buying a 2000 model year tahoe.<br><br>
