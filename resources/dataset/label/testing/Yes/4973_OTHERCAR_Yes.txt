            I have a XG300L with the 16" wheel option. The mileage is now close to 700.My last car was a 2000 Maxima GXE which i sold at 13,100 miles. Max.was a very good car with no problems but i'm known for changing cars frequently. What i can tell you is that the XG is not a rocket but is more than capable powerwise.Forget the "figures" unless the 1 second really means that much. As for gas mileage i'm getting 25+ with a 70/30 hwy/city mix. Handling is good, the ride quality is not floaty but very comfortable. The engine and five speed transmission work very well together providing seamless power.I can find shortcomings in ANY vehicle. In this one its the rather hard to see odometer.And since it has the trip computer it would be nice to see mpg readouts.Also,flimsy power seat controls-but the functions work fine.The car is otherwise very well put together.Everybody wants to compare this car to Avalon, Maxima,TL,ES, etc.I would rather turn this around.None of these other "better" cars, as far as i'm concerned, offer any more than the XG (exempt obviously reliability record-TBD).Actually most others offer less for more $.Compare price,warranty,room,driveability,looks,function,service,etc.etc.If you want "prestige"and want to spend more,then go for the "others".There are lots out there (but, just to make sure the "others"are all so great and reliable, maybe you might want to check what the owners of your favorite car have to say on web sites like "Edmunds.com"and other sites).You may be surprised what the true critics,the owners,of these cars have to say.Yes, the other cars are fine but the XG is an excellent car..  Good luck!
