            "Somebody get a picture of this!", "Send me a snapshot", "Where can I buy a roll of film?" Ah, yes - we all know those comments from "Kodak Moment" days. Then we started hearing about "digital" - Oh sure, but where's the "picture"? You know, that postcard-sized piece of "Kodak" paper that you try to keep your fingerprints off of...

Well, somebody finally built a better mousetrap. Yes, you can have that "picture" in your hand. No, there isn't any "film" to worry about, and no, you don't have to wonder if you "got a good picture".

Sony has entered this new "digital" field of photography with guns blazing. Walk into any large-chain, discount store and find that about half the digital cameras displayed are SONY. As usual, most of their stuff is hi-tech, hi-quality, state-of-the-art, and not THAT much more expensive. Needless to say, their DSC-S85 camera is right in that groove.

I have been a professional and non-professional photographer and videographer for a long time and I have weathered the digital camera mine-field of manufacturing mistakes since it began. My 1st "digicam" had no flash, low resolution, and only internal memory storage.

Well, what it took conventional film cameras 50 years to do, digital has done in under 5 years and the DSC-S85 is leading the way. The digital camera field today is huge, cluttered, and offers just about everything that any "picture-taker" could want - so you have to be choosy about what you're going to "do" with the camera.

My praise of the DSC-S85 takes all that into consideration. It easily accommodates every need of the point-n-shoot folks who want family photos galore. It easily accommodates, also, the needs of the serious amateur as well as most of the serious professionals. Amazing.

THERE IS VERY LITTLE YOU CAN'T ASK OF THIS CAMERA!

There are highly technical websites that will tell you all about the absolute limits of this camera's capabilities - but how often do we get into those situations? Not often. So, let's get down to everyday life and appreciate a great camera for what it's worth.

This camera is the right size and weight - comfortable.
This camera uses "Memory Stick" storage - all sizes.
This camera has a resolution factor of 4.1 - very high.
This camera can perform editing functions internally.
This camera has great "macro" capabilities.
This camera is so automatic that it's scary.
This camera has a full line of accessory lenses & filters.
This camera is priced comparably to inferior competition.
This camera is "married" to the HP 1315 printer.

This is a user-friendly camera that, regardless of what they say, you can print your photos in any size (wallet-sized to 8x10's) right on plain, printer paper. But, for those that want the viewer to think it came from a professional enlarging store operation, buy some "photo quality" printer paper and have at it.

Either way, my DSC-S85 Sony has already (in less than 6 months) paid for a large portion of its cost in savings of not buying FILM, DEVELOPING, and ENLARGING. The added productive element here is knowing that EVERY picture stored on that Memory Stick in the camera is a GOOD picture. The bad ones get "deleted" instantly and re-shot. No more wasted film and developing.

The "user's manual that comes with the camera is very thorough and comprehensive. Sony has a live, customer support dept. available by phone for operational problems, and full on-line availability of all accessory products for the camera.

YES, I like it.....
