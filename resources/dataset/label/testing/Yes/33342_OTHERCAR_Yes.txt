            A minivan, exactly what every suburban living family with two or more kids needs.  After all on those long trips to grandma's nothing is better than a good sized minivan where "Daddy he is in my space" is no longer heard coming from your single back seat.  

After getting this thing brand new, my family decided to go on a nice long trip to, well you guessed it, grandma's.  It handled nicely, for a minivan, and was roomy in the front and in the back.  But halfway to grandma's we found the one glitch the car had.  Fortunately, that 7 year or 70,000 mile warranty comes in handy. I don't remember exactly what went wrong, it was quite a while ago, but I do remember that the dealership paid for all the repairs and the rental car that we took the rest of the way to grandma's.

And that was the only problem we ever had with that car.  It now has 120,000 miles on it and the only thing that appears wrong with it is that little light on the dash board that says "Maintenance Required," where all you have to do is take it into the shop and pay them to turn the light off.  With the cars age came a few problems though.  The seatbelts don't retract anymore, but they still lock in case of a quick stop or accident.  The steering has also gotten more difficult and sluggish.

Other than that the car has done well, only needing oil changes every three thousand miles, and tire rotations, just like every other car out there.

Overall it is an excellent family machine.
