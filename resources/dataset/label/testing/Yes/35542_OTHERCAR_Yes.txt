            I have in the past one year bought over 8 different Digital Camera ranging from Nikon 880, Olympus C3000, Fuji 2800 and Toshiba M81 are few to be named. 

One thing I definately liked about Fuji 6800 is how quickly it powers up when you hit the button; with most other camera I have noticed that by the time camera powers and goes through the bootup cycle the object you were planning on taking has already passed you by a mile.... where as with Fuji 6800 its instant.

I've also loved the convenience of Cradle docking system; works beautifully with Windows XP .. I didnt even downloaded driver that came with the camera ... XP recognises Fuji 6800 beautifully and the fact that it came with rechargable battery saved me $30.00 or more on the spot. 

I noticed that some of the users complained about the battery life with this model but so far I have not run into this problem yet ... once fully charged (approx 1hr:40min) I was able to take over 180+ photos during my friends wedding approx 25% of the time I had Electronic Viewfinder on but most of the shots I used the manual viewfinder and used Flash on almost every single shot.

I would highly recommend a 128MB Smart Media Card or Atleast 64MB card... 16MB will be inhaled in moments time (depending on camera resolution settings)

You will find people around you taking a double take on the camera ... its small packed with features and very Techie styling ... looks like a device came straight out of StarWars Movie. I have had many people stopped and asked me about the camera and when you show them the pictures you hear .... waaaaaooh ... and aaaaaaahhhh and oooh.... 

Keep a towel handy I would say !!!

Now my next purchase in few weeks will be a Fuji F601
