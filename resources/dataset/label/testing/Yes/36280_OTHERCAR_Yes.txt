            I bought the car for the price.  It was small.  So is the car.  That isn't necessarily bad, but at 5'7&quot;, I find that I have little room to spare.  My wife leaves the seat forward, I bang my knee below the steering wheel when I get in.  On the other hand, the seat adjustment is the easiest I have ever encountered.  A long bar across the front of the bottom edge of the seat is easily disengaged with my heal before I get in the car.  The seat glides back and I slide in.  No banged knee - when I remember to adjust the seat before climbing in.

On long trips, there is no comfortable way to position the right foot to keep a constant speed (I should have bought cruise control!).

But buying the car was no mistake.  It gets more than 30 mpg on the highway and has enough power to accelerate to and maintain highway speeds.  The five-speed standard transmission is easy to become accustomed to and forgiving of those who are just learning to drive a manual transmission.  Although the car is small on the outside (and easy to get into tight spaces), it is remarkably large in the passenger area (even the back seat)and trunk.<br><br>
