            This is a 20k mile report for my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder.  I've had this truck for a year now as I got it shortly after it came out on the market.  

The Specs:
I bought the top of the line LE 3.5 model which comes with: the sunroof (which opens all the way unlike that of the Xterra which bumps up just about an inch), heated leather seats, 6 cd bose system, the sweet V6 with 240hp engine, 4X4 suspension, anti-lock brakes, the works.  

Ride and Joy:
So far I am quite pleased with it.  Passing on the highway is no problem, and the raised view so characteristic of an SUV is great, as I can spot problems up ahead much earlier then drivers in cars.  Of course I pay the price of paying more at the pump, but that's a trade-off I am happy to make.  The ride is car like, though you will notice a difference between the ride of a pathfinder and a mercedes sedan, as the ride cannot equal that of good quality sedans, but still very comfortable.  The bose music system is good, as you hear little sound outside the car, but as you step in, the volume fills the car.

Gripes:
There is no automatic 4x4, as there is a manual shifter which is not a problem, but if I am nitpicking, an automatic 4X4 could be a good luxury item.  Gas mileage is always a problem with SUVs, my truck gives around 16-18mpg.  

Conclusion:
Overall, the pathfinder is a very good, dependable, strong, comfortable and powerful truck that I find quite ideal to my needs.  It gets five out of five stars!
