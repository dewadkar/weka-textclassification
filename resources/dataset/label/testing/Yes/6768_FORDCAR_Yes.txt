            Fords descision to discontinue the Aerostar was a mistake. This is the second one Ive owned, [see my other review on the 1990 Aerostar.} After owning 2 of these vans i still say they are great.

When my 90 Aerostar was totaled in an accident i immediatley began hunting for another one, since they are not in production anymore they are getting harder to find. Luckily i found a green 1997 XLT that was nicely decked out with running boards, sunvisors, rain gutters, hood protector, and alloy wheels.

Since 1990 the van hasn't gone through much changes, the interior dash was re-designed. Personaly i like the old design better, but the new design is nothing to complain about, the controls are easy to reach and operate. The van runs very smooth and rides great, there have been no known problems with the van.

The seats are soooo comfortable. The two front seats have a knob you can turn wich will increase or decrease firmness in the lower section of the seat, a pretty neat option in my opinion. The back seats are nice and soft making them ideal for longer road trips. The 97 is just as spacious as the 90, still satisfying the needs of my picky passangers. There is a storage bin that pulls out from under the passangers seat, you can never get enough storage bins in any vehicle.


Fuel economy is also great, in the 90 i managed to get 19 MPG in the city. So far with the 97 it appears as if im getting around 18. The 3.0L litre engine is fairly powerful, but i think it could be a little better. I hear the 4.0L engine is allot more powerful but i have not driven one so i can't say for sure, but it makes sense, bigger engine means more power, so if you want a van with more spunk, hunt for a 4.0L. I myself wanted a 4.0L extended length, but the 3.0L standard length i found was too decked out to pass up, and i am very happy with it.

Ford was stupid for stopping the production of these vans. I would defintley buy another, and so would many other people.

**UPDATE 5-31-02** 6 months and almost 8000 miles later and everything is still great. The vans gone through several changes i have done to give it a more personal touch. It hasnt given me any problems other than sluggish acceleration [especially up hill] but i had it checked out and everything passed and was fine so the problem is probly just a simple tune-up. Everything else is working well. If i have one complaint about Aerostars it would be the fact they rust easy, im starting to notice a few specs on the rocker panel, wich i will fix, so if you own one, or are planning on buying one...keep it clean and WAX! The vans are great, take care of them and theyll take better care of you.
