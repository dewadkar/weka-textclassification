            Overall, I must admit this is a great buy. I found one on-line for $800 plus about $20 shipping, no complaints so far regarding the photo quality, if there is any, it has to do with my lack of photography skill, but not the camera. For that price, I consider it's worthwhile, even though I haven't owned any digital camera before. It was recommended to me by a friend who had many years of digital-camera-ing experience, and who had switched back & forth between Nixon and Canons. I decided on Canon because they had smaller cameras and better looks--hey, look matters!

There, finally, I can shoot professional-quality "bedroom album" and private porns without blushing in front of a Walgreen's sales assistant. You can shoot photos that stretch bigger than your monitor size (and I'm talking about 21" monitors) and just as clear as a mechanically taken photo scanned in. Except you don't have to go through all that pain of waiting for the scanner lamp to "yeeek... yeeek" banking back.

The preset photo-shooting features are very cute and convenient, you don't have to buy a Powershot G1 for Dummies in order to impress your friends, just read through the user guide is enough.

Caution: at night-mode the shutter speed is super slow, a minor shake of the wrist will blur the image significantly. It is less-than-recommended to shoot pics at midnight parties where you already had quite a few drinks down your belly. What I'd recommend, however, is that if the light is sufficiently bright (the digital camera is pretty light-sensitive), shoot with one of those day-time modes. You can also try shooting without the flash, for sometimes I find turning on the flash makes the close-by subject too bright. On the other hand, if you are good with Photoshop, you can turn some of the darker photos into ones with fascinating Renaissance oil-painting effects. The limit is only bounded by imagination and your insight. Visit www.mingminghao.com for sample (& manipulated) shots.

Little LCD screen has a marvellously sharp image with good colors. You generally get a pretty good idea what quality your photo has just by looking at that little screen, and can remove the less-than-desirable photos without fearing "did I just make a mistake?". The color is a bit off for smaller details, but hey, what do you expect when your 2048x1076 photo is compressed into a half-palm-sized screen?

Battery lasts a long time. I've *refuel*ed several times, never because the battery was running out, but rather because my confidence on the long battery life was running low, that I started wondering how come after so long the battery icon still shows "full"?

Movie-shooting feature is a wonderful add-on, the microphone is pretty good considering how small it is. Not that it is really required, but it was definitely stupid for Canon not to throw in a catalog of their digital camcorder products in the Powershot G1 package, because those 30-sec movie clips are real teasers. I want a digital camcorder now! :(

USB connection is pretty fast, the software is easy to use, and I liked the feature that you can delete photos on your card via the software.

Complaints: my complaints have been repeated by other reviewers. I'll just list them briefly--yes, Canon should have supplied a soft pouch for the camera. I had to buy a case for it, only to find that it catches the switch of the camera and often turns it on when I was putting the camera in/out of the case. I would highly recommend they review their design for the power & mode switch for their next camera, it turns out to be quite a nuance to find your camera 'auto-power-off'ed when it was taken out of the case. If you get a case, definitely get one that was similar to the style of the one displayed on the Canon G1 accessory guide, only a case that opens from the top will not catch the switch from time to time.

Indeed, the camera doesn't look very sturdy. The silver appearance is very pleasing, but is also a pain in the mind for worries, because any scratch will show up big time and never go away. The camera is the biggest and heaviest of all its digital cousins so far. But then again, I do observe a trend among cameras such that the more powerful it is, the bulkier/heavier it tends to be.

The hotshoe makes it possible to replace the built-in flash with a *real* one (note, get another case for the new flash, unless you don't mind it sticking out of your little camera case like a chunky black potato). 

The 16MB CF card will soon become out-of-date in front of your greed for more memory space. It's like driving a sports car with an electric car's battery, with the speed you wanted, you can only surf the highway for 30 mins. So get ready to spend another $100~200 (or $500 if you are going for the Minds@Work's digital wallet) for a 'memory upgrade'.

One last thing that bugs me: the photo display only has 2-sec or 7-sec options for after-shoot instant review. 2-sec is too short, 7-sec is unnecessarily long, what I need (and I bet I'm not alone on this either) is a 5-sec configuration, even better, what about making it customisable between 1~10 secs? That shouldn't be a feature too technically difficult to implement.

A caution for cat-owners: tie the camera lens cap on the wrist string immediately! My cats found the lens cap a wonderful hockey puck and I was foolish enough to leave it on the kitchen table unguarded. Three months later I found it again under a big suitcase when I was moving, that was two & a half months after I spent $20 to buy a replacement cap from Canon--you can't find it anywhere else. Don't laugh! This really happened!

Overall, not a bad choice at all, for the price you pay.
