            My wife got a 4X4 SLT plus shortly after our first child was born and it's fantastic.  She is in outside sales and put 40,000 miles on the truck last year.  The SLT plus is fully loaded with leather, heated seats, dual heat/ac, cd stereo, 3rd row seats, etc.

I couldn't expect anymore from a vehicle that has gotten the kind of abuse we've put it through.  The best feature is the versatility - a ski trip to Colorado with the seats down and skis in the back, everyday driving with the kiddo in a car seat, traveling to football games with people in the the third row of seats.  All of that in basically the same length as the Maxima we traded in.  Granted, the third row is small, but it's better than taking 2 vehicles most of the time.  If you often need to carry that many passengers, maybe an Excursion or a Suburban is what you need.

I recently bought an R/T and it's great too, for all the same reasons, plus tons more horsepower, suede accents inside, and much better handling (the SLT has more bounce).

Now, the down side.  My wife's Durango gets about 15 mpg overall while I struggle to get 11-12.  While R/T handles better overall, both truck's rear end suspensions pretty much suck.  Hitting a bump at moderate to high speed on a curve can be a little dicey - it feels like the rear end wants to keep going straight.  

It may not be perfect, but its pretty darn good.
