            I bought my Saturn 2001 SC1 on June 21st. I can't believe how much I love it! Before I bought a Saturn, everyone I talked to said how reliable they are and how I would love it. I guess I haven't had it long enough to say it is definitely reliable. I got in on the deal of 0.9% interest, for 60 months. I also got the extended warranty, for only $17 more a month. My total payment is $298/month. 
I couldn't believe the service. My credit was checked over the phone, and he called me to tell me 20 minutes later that I was approved for the 0.9%. The sales guy picked me up in the company car so my fiance would not have to drive me all the way to the dealer. There was no hassle. I went to the dealer, signed the papers, and took my car home. (I chose to have my mom co-sign, to save on insurance, but she was not required to be present, I just took the papers to her and she signed them.) 
Now that you know the extra details, I'll tell you about the car itself. It is electric blue. It seats 4 people, has comfortable seats, has a very spacious trunk, enough cup holders for 6 cups (2 in front, and 4 in back), a CD player, air conditioning and an automatic transmission. Its a fairly small car, however even my fiance, who is 6'4" loves to drive it! I am very comfortable driving it, even though I am used to driving an '85 Chevette, probably the smallest car known to man! The car is wonderful to drive. Bumps and holes in the road are barely noticeable. With the windows up, outside noise is barely audible. The engine has more power than my Chevette, however it isn't the most powerful car in the world, but that's fine with me. I don't need nor want to race anyone in it. The radio has 12 FM stations and 6 AM stations. The odometer is electronic. There are daytime running lamps, which I find annoying but I guess they can be useful at dusk, when I may forget to turn my lights on right away. The windshield wipers have 6 settings: high, low, intermediate 1, 2, 3 and mist. The clock is always on. 
I think I've given you enough information. Test drive one, and see for yourself!
