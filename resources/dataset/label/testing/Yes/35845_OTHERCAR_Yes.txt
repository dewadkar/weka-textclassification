            I traded in a 1995 ford probe for a 1997 saturn SL2 and this is what I think:

The Good:

---95% of the car is made right here in United States. Compare that to other cars!!
---One of the smaller yet safer cars made which means cheaper insurance rates.
---Small car yet offers plenty of space inside . I have two cars seats in the back of mine and yet there is still room for me to sit between them.
---Saturn dealership treats you like family and will go out of there way to see that their customers are happy.
---About 25 miles to the gallon
---You won't break the bank purchasing a Saturn.
---As an option, they offer a switch which can shut off the power to the back windows which is great for kids who love to play with windows.

The Bad:

---I don't like how the car handles or drives. The engine is very loud.
---The small things matter to me. Such as there is no &quot;SCAN&quot; button on the radio, there is no trunk light or ignition light or arm rest.
---About 25 miles to the gallon-my probe got 35.<br><br>
