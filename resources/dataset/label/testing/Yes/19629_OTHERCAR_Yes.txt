            I just got my D-150 from cameraworld.com and I really like it a lot.  I did about a month's worth of research into what I was looking for - a sub $300 camera that I could carry around in my pocket on hikes, vacations, kid's soccer etc that produced better than average image quality vs other camera's in it's class.   I own an Olympus Stylus Epic film camera and I just love it, it's small and easy to use and deliver's outstanding prints.  I guess I just wanted the same in digital format.

I looked at the Fuji Finepix, Sony P30, Canon A-10 as well as they are all in about the same price range.  The Fuji and Canon did not have video-out (connect to TV) which is something I wanted and will use.  The Sony eliminated itself with it's expensive memory sticks (about double the price of smartmedia).  I fussed between the D-100 and D-150 (only difference is zoom) and I'm glad I got the zoom, makes taking pics of people better.

After playing for a week now I really like the D-150 a lot.  The image quality is really good - sure a $500 or $600 camera might deliver better, but the quality is good enough for me, especially when 96% of the time I'll be keeping the images in digital format. If I do need to print it should be good up to 5 x 7 which is fine.  I picked up a 64mb smartmedia card for $42 at Costco and a set of 1600ma rechargeable NiMH batteriers and charger for about $22 at Wal*Mart.  I don't know if the Camedia software is any good or not because I use Photoshop to do touchups (although aside from cropping and a touch of sharpening, the images are good to go right out of the camera).  So, with the supplied 8mb card, my 64mb card, and a 16mb card that cameraworld.com threw in for free I can take about 270 pics at HQ setting.  That will work for me!

The camera says ultrafast, but I'm not sure what that means.  It takes about 1 second for it to focus, but there is almost no noticeable lag when the shutter button is pressed.  Also, since it is a passive focus camera it does not do well in getting a focus lock in very low lighting or in the dark.

Olympus was smart in that 2 of the more common tasks - setting flash option and turning macro on and off - can be done without going into the menu system.  Deleting a pic immediately after you take it is easy and fast - although it's not intuitive, so read the manual.
