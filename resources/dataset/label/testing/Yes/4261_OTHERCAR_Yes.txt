    I guess my family has some kind of hankering towards BMW cars, so for my graduation present guess what I bought???? a green BMW 318Ti. We were so lucky to fall into this deal. It was a 1998 loaner car with only 9,000 miles on it. It wasn't even supposed to be sold. I mean what a deal. I love practically everything about the car. The ride is so smooth that you can hardly feel the road, unless you go over some big bumps(yet any car would feel those). The gas mileage in this great machine is incredible, and the handling is the best that I have come across. Yes this car is a hatchback, but it in no way, shape, or form resembles a tick (Geo Metro). Instead, it has a very sleek and sporty look to it. 
    The only problem with this car is that the performance lacks. It takes close to 8-9 seconds to get my baby from 0-60, which is pretty pitiful, but (I dunno if my Father's car is sick or not) it can beat my father's 318 convertible any day. Another problem with my car is that the speakers distort when I turn the sound up, and the wheels are the black steel wheels with the ugly hubcaps. Yet, the reason my car is like this is because it is a base model.
   Anyone who is in the market for a great entry level BMW should really consider this great piece of machinery. It's cheap and just an all around great car. Plus (for guys), chicks dig the car.
