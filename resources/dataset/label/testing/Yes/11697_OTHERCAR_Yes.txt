            I purchased my GTI VR6 from a friend that was leasing and needed to get out of the lease...   It had only 14,000 miles on it, considering I paid only $14,300 I think I got a great deal for everything it came with...

The car is fast, stops on a dime, handles great, so far reliable, and comfortable.   Overall fit and finish is very good - better than average.  A/C works well and all controls are easy to use and the layout of controls make sense.  The cup / beverage holder is useless except for standard sized aluminum cans. Lacks auxiliary power plug for cell phone, though if you don't smoke the cig lighter plug will do fine.   One feature that seems not to work properly is the outside temp gauge in the control pod. The VW dealer was unable to tell me why or fix the fact that it reads on average 8 to 9 degrees higher than it should. Though not a big deal for most, when traveling in cold regions it's nice to know when the temp falls below 32 degrees so you're aware of potential black ice conditions that could form on the road.

My only real complaint is the doors and the rear lift hatch door. The driver's side door rattles, as does the passenger door sometimes.  The 2 doors also sound like they rub excessively against the weather seals causing an annoying rub/squeak noise.  I typically hear it when going over rough road areas and it is loud enough and frequent enough that passengers have commented - I hate that.  The rear hatch door has a squeak and I have been unable to find it.  Though it is not constant, it's still annoying.  Silicon lube on all the door seals has not helped.  The VW dealer said they adjusted the strike plate on the driver side door, which didn't help either.   This seems typical for older VWs I have been in, but with less than 20,000 miles on my car and it coming on being only 4 years old I think it's inexcusable.

Other small cons are the sunroof switch must be held in to open and close the sunroof.  It would be nice to have an "express" switch as there is on the door windows.   Also, the sunroof switch does not operate unless the ignition is in the on position.   I find that odd considering the door windows will operate, even with the key out of the ignition switch, until a door is open.  A "nice to have" would be rear vent windows typically found on older 2 door cars.  It would help to get some venting / flow through in the back passenger area.

The car's stereo is fine, nothing special.   Though it sounds good, for a "premium" system it lacks the sound quality I would expect.  Further, the controls and the display screen is only adequate.  The CD changer in the trunk area is a VW changer; it tends to skip on rough roads and especially when it's cold.

Overall it's a ton of fun to drive and other than the above it's been a great car.   I expect I'll figure out the squeaks and rattles since when it rains they seem to go away.   

I would recommend this car to anyone that's looking for a compact with incredible performance and good reliability.   With a GTI VR6 you have all the options, including leather, that you would want in a day to day driving car.
