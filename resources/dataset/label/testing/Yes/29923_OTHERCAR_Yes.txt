            If you need technical specs. please visit motortrend.com or roadandtrack.com. I will only write about my opinion of this vehicle.

1. I was really pleased when I saw the interior. The front seats are very comfortable. The leather is soft and of high quality. Even the fold down rear seats are just as comfortable as the back seat of most subcompact sedan.
2. The exterior I think has that mean, off-road, "I'll run your Civic over" appeal. It is fairly high and from its massive tires and sporty looking wheel, it really seems like a "monster" truck with character.
3. The sound system is superb. It sounds like one of those $2000 aftermarket system. The bass creeps to your spine and the highs are well defined and crisp.
4. The ride is comfortable and the acceleration is smooth but not fast. For an SUV this big, I really think it can really benefit if it has more than 200 hp. Although it is adequate, it can use a few more to improve acceleration.  It does not rev fast. It lacks a little bit of throttle response. I am assuming this is typical of most SUV but I have driven minivans and a couple of other SUV that seems to want to rev quicker. 
5. The rearview is great assuming you don't have passengers at the very rear. This SUV seems higher when driving. I feel like in a big rig and "king" the road. This SUV really gives you that feel.
6. The engine is fairly quiet.
7. Opening the hood, the engine bay looks a bit too plain. I like fancier, meaner looking engine bay but this one is quite plain.
8. This SUV loves gasoline. Well, that is typical for most SUVs.
