            I consider myself the average Joe Shmo, therefore I am not going to bore you with all the technical jargon.  I am just going to give you my OPINION of what I think of the car I bought.

The price is awesome.  The actual price I got mine for is $15,600, about 1000 less than the sticker.  It came with the optional moon roof and alloy wheels for only an additional $300 because I bought it in late 2002.  Plus Zero, Zero, Zero.  0 down, 0% financing, and 0 payments until 2003.  I purchased mine in October.

What can I say, it drives very well, gets good gas mileage, and has the new car look and feel.  The steering stands out because of the wrapped steering wheel and the excellent handling for an economy car.

It seats five people but I think they meant five small people.  The seating can be tight if you are 250lbs.

Its has all the gadgets you need like pwr windows, locks, mirrors, air conditioning, rear defrost, cd player, etc.
Also included was the remote lock/unlock unit.  That was a major plus.  

The car has good pep too!  My friend has a Honda Civic and I would say that this is quite comparable.  But everyone has a Civic.  This is a tad different.

Interestingly, this car is assembled in Japan and shipped here.  Unlike the Civic which is assembled here.

The Protege has all the power you need to get you to work and back in comfort.  So far I have about 3000 miles on it and it has been a very pleasurable experience.   The reason I bought a Mazda is because I also have a Mazda MX-6 '90 that has 170,000 miles on it.  So I figured if that Mazda made it that far, this one should make it.

The car can get slightly loud on the highway.  And there are sounds heard of air seeping in through the doors.  Not that big a problem for me, but the lady notices everything.

I would change a thing or two about the fabric used for the seats.  There is no leather option, therefore I am stuck with the boring gray fabric.  However, the dash looks awesome.  Everything has a green glow and the steering wheel is wrapped in black leather and makes the steering feel very sporty.   

I would like to upgrade the tires though.  In wet conditions and making a turn during acceleration, the tires tend to spin.  Obviously the Proteges 140 horsepower engine is not the monster that is forcefully spinning the tires.  It is the traction of the tires.  And they are brand new.

I may also get the windows tinted a little because they are crystal clear.  I don't believe the factory adds any tint to the windows like some autos.  

Lastly, there is a Mazda dealer very close in most Chicagoland locations (where I live).  The dealer promised to wash my car if I bring it in for an oil change every 3000 miles.  I haven't brought it in yet, but I will find out soon.
