            I got my 1993 taurus 3 years ago, and absolutely love it... I bought it used, and in the 3 years i've had it, i've only had to have general maintenence work done on it. Never any major problems. I am a fan of bigger cars, and I love the amount of room I have in the back as well as the front. The velour seats feel like a comfy sofa! I have to say, the stock radio it comes with isn't the best, but hey, that's not the most important thing. It gets pretty good gas mileage, I usually fill it up and that lasts me for the week (and I do alot of traveling on the weekends). The only bad thing I have to say is alot of things are not easy to get to if you want to fix them yourself. My boyfriend does all the work to my car, and he's always complaining. I agree, some of the things ford did in the car were not well thought out. The cup holder for example, has a plastic piece over it which makes it hard to get cups out and in and usually causes spilling.. (hence the stains on my carpet!) :) But other than that, it's an extremely reliable car and i'm glad I chose it. (time for something new though!) Looking forward to my new camry! ;)
