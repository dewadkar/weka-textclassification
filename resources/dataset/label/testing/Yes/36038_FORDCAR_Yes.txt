            My husband just got a new job, which is going to require a lot of travelling. The way we saw it, we had two options: run either of our 10 year old+ cars into the ground, or by a new one. Somehow, my husband convinced me to trade in my 1991 Cavalier Convertible to a new car. (This car was like a dear friend of mine...a long story, but let's say I didn't want to give it up.) Because I was trading in my precious car, he pretty much let me decide which new car to get. I initially had some reserves about a Focus- it was a new model and I was hesitant to buy the premiere edition and let Ford work the bugs out on me. But, I did a lot of research, (naturally here at epinions and elsewhere)and I decided on the Focus. I am not the only one- the Ford Focus was named <b>Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2000</b> You can put whatever stock in that you want, but I give it some creedence (I have a feeling these guys know cars.) 

We got a new 2000 gold Ford Focus SE. Actually, if you look on the epinion page for the Focus, the car there looks <i>exactly</i> like mine. The Focus comes in 5 basic models: the basic no frills Focus LX, the frilly SE (mine), the loaded ZTS, the Station Wagon SE, and the hatchback ZX3. The main differences in the LX, SE, and ZTS are how upgraded they are, and the ZTS has a little more souped up engine.

<b>2000 Ford Focus SE</b>

<b> Asthetics.</b>
OK let's face it. This car is cute. It has a sleek look- cool headlights, nice body, solar tinted glass standard, a cool little Beetle-like antennae, and fog lights (I just love those- it makes your car look like it's going to eat someone.) And ours has a spoiler, which my race-loving husband thought was too cool. Very cute. You just know one when you see it coming. (There's a pic of mine on my profile page if you want a close up.) Of course, this is a totally subjective thing- you are going to like how it looks or you aren't. I did. I loved it. So, I was naturally drawn to it. Then I got in.

<b>Features that make you go wow!</b>
(Please realize that many of these features are NOT standard- they came as part of our SE package.)

My husband and I are pretty sure that it was a new, young engineer that designed this car. Why? because it is what I would call a &quot;thinking&quot; car. From the way it is laid out, you can just see someone sitting in the car saying &quot;Hmmm, now where should I put this?&quot; with no presupposition. Everything is in a handy place!

Now, you are not going to get in this car and say &quot;what the ...&quot;- it looks like a normal car, but everything is well placed, or maybe I should use the word ergonomic. The blinker and windshield wiper control are high on the steering column so you an reach over with your finger to hit it and don't have to take your hand off the wheel. Likewise, your cruise control is in the steering wheel so you don't have to take your hand off the wheel either. Also, we have a tilt and telescoping wheel, and the control is under the steering column. You know how most of the time you have a little stick sticking out of the column? This control fits under the column and it pops out if you want to move the wheel. It makes it a little difficult if you want to move the wheel in transit, but you wouldn't do that now would you? The control pops out, you move the wheel, and then it pops in again flush with the column so that it doesn't stick out. So you have to tilt or cruise control levers on your column- I like that. You only have blinkers and windshield wiper controls sticking out and it makes it all a lot easier. 

However, although this engineer was a genius, he was not tall. I am 6 feet tall, and I wish there was a little more room inside. I would like the drivers seat to go back a little more (but I like to drive with my legs really stretched out) and it can be hard for me if I have normal sized people sitting in the back. I am sure for you normal-sized people, this will not be a problem, but if you have really long legs, you should test drive this baby first. Although the head room is great, the leg room could be a little more. 

I also need to mention <b> The Trunk.</b> I capitalize for a reason. Peek through the window outside at your neighbor's new Focus, or quick go run to the dealership and look at the back end of this car. You will think that this car could not hold a bag of pretzels, much less your stroller, or golf clubs. WRONG. <b>The trunk on this car is astounding.</b> It is absolutely huge. As my mom said when she saw it &quot;You could definitely stow a body in here.&quot; (?!?!?!) But she was right!! Again, the engineers used their noggins. This car's trunk is simply huge. 

And if it's not big enough, <b> the rear seats fold down.</b> I have a four door sedan, and mine fold down- this is not only a hatchback feature. The trunk has two little handles you pop and the seats fold down. WOW!!! You have to love that.
 
OK, so now you know you look good on the outside and you are comfortable on the inside. You are ready to go. What is your experience going to be like? 

<b>How the Focus handles.</b>
OK, so by now the men have said &quot;wait a sec...she was driving a 1991 Cavalier Convertible RS with a V6 3.1L engine....LOL LOL LOL&quot; OK, so guess what. This car has a 4 cylinder 2.0L engine. Girls, this means it has 2 less cylinders to explode gas and make your car go. This means that this car does not have the pickup and rev as my old car. Going from a V6 to a 4 cylinder was a little of an adjustment for me, but I was pleasantly surprised. And look, if you are used to a 4 cylinder engine (as most cars are, especially in this car's class) then you will love this engine right off. I have found that it does not have the fuel injection (girls, read being able to jump off the starting line) of my Cavalier, but you are not in any danger if you want to pull out- this car will let you have the gas you need. It is a <i>very</i> smooth ride- I live in a construction area and have hit some bumps with no problem. It is also front wheel drive and handles great in the rain.

The car is <b>very quiet</b> as well. Even when it is idling in my garage, it is pretty quiet. Sometimes when the garage door is open already and my husband just pulls in, I won't know he came in, even from the rooms adjacent to the garage. 

This car also <b>takes the curves</b> very well. It is a tall car for its class (it totally dwarfs my 85 BMW 325e) but it handles like a car much lower to the ground. The steering column moves easily and driving this car is no problem. It is very smooth and hugs the curves- I was pleasantly surprised. And if you get a little crazy, it has dual airbags to catch you.

It also has amazing <b>gas mileage</b>. This car will get 27 miles city and 35 highway. Oh yes it does. This was one of the biggest selling points for us. My husband made it from Lexington where we live Indianapolis (about 250 miles) on 3/4 of a tank of gas. Yay!

OK, so let's recap. You look awesome, you are comfortable and have all you need in reach (including your soda in the standard cup holders- i love that) and you're driving along comfortably in an easy rider that handles well. You are probably saying &quot;OK so this is just like my _____insert name of car. Why should I buy a Focus?&quot; 

Again, here is where the Ford engineers got together and used their noggins. There are all kinds of cool, nifty, awesome little features that set this car apart and make it a <b>car of value.</b> My car's sticker was $16,020, and the only thing it doesn't have is a CD player and leather seats. Considering all you get, it is very good value. Here are some of the other goodies that really sold me on this car:

<b> Wow other cool goodies!</b>
Here are some features that I thought were just flat out cool- some you can find on all Focus' and some just on the higher level models. 

<b>Baby seat anchor</b>
Wow this one got me. The Focus has 3 little hatches in the back window base. You pop up the cover, and there is a hook in which you hook your baby's seat. Know what this means? <i>Your baby is hooked into the frame of the car, not just held in by the seatbelts.</i> Isn't that cool? Your child isn't going anywhere. That is a big bonus for me, because we will probably be starting a family before we sell this car. I am glad to know my kids will have some extra security when they are in the backseat.

<b>Child lock doors and windows</b>
You can control the back doors and windows so that they cannot be opened by children. The rear window controls won't work- you can down them from the driver's seat and they won't go all the way down. And, the doors won't open except from the outside.

<b>Child-proof gear shifter.</b>
My car does not have this, but you can get an option where there is a place next to the gear shift that, when locked, the car cannot be moved out of park. You have to unlock it back to get your car out of park. This helps prevent children from inadvertently putting the car in reverse or another gear when you are not in the car. (It has happened to all of us...)

<b>Inside-the-trunk release button that glows in the dark.</b>
If you kids play around the car and get locked in the trunk, there is a release button that glows in the dark. 

<b>Anti theft standard</b>: NO this is not an alarm, it is called &quot;Securilock&quot; and it means that when you get in, if the right key is not inserted, the car will not work. So uncoded dupliates will not work. Nice to have.

<b>Height-adjustable seat belts:</b> no more getting hanged by your seat belt

<b>Trunk Popper</b> (I just love these)-situated on the main console by the driver's door

<b>Pen Holder:</b> OK this is great for my salesman husband. On the place between the seats where the emergency brake is, there is are two little prongs and a slot for a pen. Isn't that cool?? You never know how cool it is until you have one LOL.

<b>Pop out stereo section:</b> I think this one is standard- there is a section of the stereo that pops out and the stereo won't work without it. It is a section of the programmed stations numbers. It is a small piece, but your stereo won't work without it. Cool little anti-theft device.

<b>Stereo works without the key in for one hour.</b> So, when you are vacuuming and cleaning out your car, you can have the stereo on. See what I mean? These engineers were THINKING. LOL

<b>Speed Sensitive Stereo:</b> You can set this stereo so that when you slow the music gets quieter, and vice versa. This lets you hear at an intersection or a railroad crossing (no one wants you to drive this beautiful new car into a Norfolk Southern!) 

<b>Cup holders standard.</b> My BMW does not have these- you don't know what you've got until it's not there.... There is even one cupholder for the backseat in the main console that holds your emergency brakes.

<b>Keyless entry.</b> Oh come on, you know you love it. (with panic button and a trunk release.)

OK, OK: <b>One annoying thing.</b> This car has a seatbelt bonger the likes of which I have never seen. If you don't put your seatbelt on right away, this car bongs so loud and fast it makes you think a bomb is going off. At first I just tried to ignore it to see what it does. It keeps on. And on and on. It will keep bonging every 10 seconds or so if you don't put your seatbelt. I guess it just loves you and wants you to be safe. But when you forget it can be a little annoying.

WHEW I think that is it. This car is amazing--you get all of this for under $16000!!! And it is cute and fun to drive to boot. This car is well-thought out, comfortable, and I have not had one <i>real</i> complaint about it, except that it doesn't have a 6 cylinder engine. (Although the ZTS model has a Zetec engine that has extra power- still 4 cy. 2.0L, but a little more kick.)

I really have enjoyed having this car. I love the way it looks, handles, and saves on gas in these expensive gas days. If you don't believe me, go test drive one! But beware, you might find yourself in love with a car...
