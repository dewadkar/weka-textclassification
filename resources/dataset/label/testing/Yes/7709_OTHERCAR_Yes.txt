            The Chevrolet Tahoe is, in a nutshell, a large expensive luxury vehicle with a capacity for going off road.  The Tahoe like most SUVs is hard to maneuver in cramped spaces such as crowded parking lots, etc., but is worth its size in open areas.  For those who plan on doing alot of off road driving, then I believe there are several more prepared vehicles for the job.  But, for those of us who plan on seldom going off road, and primarily just plan on toting larger masses than will fit in the average compact car,  than this is a great automobile.  The V8 size engine produces much more horsepower than most SUVs of its size and even smaller.  The interior of the car is very nice and with leather seats, can be very luxurious and comfortable.  Basically I would recommend the Tahoe to any and all who plan on doing little off road use.<br><br>
