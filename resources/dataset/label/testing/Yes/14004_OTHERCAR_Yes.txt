            In the never-ending battle to find a quality automobile every two years for my wife, I've gone through a lot of pain. Ford has won the battle for the last 6 years with 3 leases on 3 highly equipped Explorers. Alas, all good things do indeed come to an end. This time around Ford has seen fit to price themselves to the point of ridiculousness for the features and options she desired on this Bi-annual journey. $34,000 was way too much to spend on what amounts to an underpowered, overzealous cousin of a pickup truck with a few luxury items thrown in. Painful indeed.

Cut to the hunt for a new vehicle. Ughh the pain! 8 dealerships in 3 weeks, 8 different automobile makes with model information to devour and digest, obligatory test drives with yappy, unknowledgeable, overly enthusiastic salespeople whose main claim to fame is how hard they push for personal information in order to "dig the spurs" into you so they can "go for the kill" in the sale. "The Horror"

Add if you will that of these 7 dealerships, 4 of them NEVER talked to the ultimate decision maker of this pair, my wife, other than a courteous greeting. "Oh the Evil they unleashï¿½.

Proceed to the 7th dealership, the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, the pounding headache, the sore muscles, and aching back from endless walking, bending, scraped shins from climbing in and out of small, cramped vehicles that promised luxury but did not deliver same, the endless bartering with sales managers whose only vocabulary surely must have been based on the words "can't, won't and cost more" was taking it's toll. Ahhhh some relief!!!. A nice automobile emerged, Mazda's Millenia. Can we get the color we want? No! ouch! Ok then we'll take red. Got a new one to deliver? NO! program car with 300 miles on it. Groan!! OK then get it ready and if all is ok, we'll take it. It emerges, a quick inspection reveals a 1 inch scratch on the drivers side door. "Sick feeling returns" Can you get the body shop to fix it? Answer: " We'll send you a bottle of touch up paint in the mail!" "Dizziness and nausea sweep over my body" No, you don't understand, I am buying a NEW car here, not a bottle of paint and 2 hours of my day off, can't you get someone to even check to see if they can't buff it out? An almost unbelievable swivel of the head and a huge shrug of the shoulders told me to forget it, the torture is not yet over. Bye Mazda.

Cut to a week later, a workplace friend with a smile on her face and rosy healthy cheeks asked why I looked so ill. I regaled her with the sordid tale of my journey into hell. She stated "You really ought to check out Infiniti, I just bought an I35" as she swooped out of the room barely touching the ground, as light as a feather, with grace and agility an Olympian would envy.

With scowling, short tempered wife in tow (after the previous experiences it was understandable), we arrived at the Infiniti dealership. I forced my body to once again land my feet on the hot pavement of possible purgatory while gremlins played jump rope with my intestines. 

A pleasant well dressed man greeted us at the line of cars in front. (My wife already engaged playfully looking at the I35). With 3 questions he determined what I wanted, needed in the way of financing, and who would be driving the car. The final question giving him the answer he needed, he said "lets go join your wife". The jump rope slowed a bit. He proceeded to delve into what SHE was looking for in an automobile. The jump rope slowed to a crawl. Deftly and methodically he inched around the shiny new automobile pointing out features, answered questions with educated gusto while always directing the answers to the ultimate buyer, the lady with a "Mona Lisa" smile inching across her face. He did not forget me in this dance, he swiftly and pointedly directed me to look under the hood while looking at her and stating facts and specs that any Car and Driver Magazine writer would be proud to admit knowing. Interest now replaced the jump rope an unfamiliar feeling struck me, the pain is subsiding. Do you see a style and color that you like? If not we can get it for you within a week. He stated to her. I seemed to be taking deeper, less labored breaths now. She pointed out an I35 with a lovely Bronze bordering on a grey colored classy match with supple beige leather interior. He grinned and stated "ahh a lady with taste". Her "Mona Lisa smile turned to a embarrassed grin" I thought to myself "this guy knows how to butter toast". I sat in the passenger side as he ushered her into the drivers seat. He tucked himself into the rear, his 6'2" or more frame easily gliding into the space. He remained silent throughout the test drive only talking when asked questions and only adding that we should take the automobile on every surface that we would be driving on so we could get the feel of it in all of our driving instances. We did so. 

This automobile was smooth, the quiet was outstanding and impressive, the interior crafted by artesian car makers who cared about their products. The sound system was tested extensively one handedly while taking corners that would scare mere mortals by the formerly scowling wife that was now the grinning daredevil woman that I have seen on occasion which absolutely forced me to marry her. What is that strange feeling I said to myself, instantly I thought "The pain isn't there", I said to myself, "Naaaa can't be" "It'll come again" With a wry smile I said to the daredevil, "test the power a bit hun" With a look of evil on her face she mashed the accelerator with glee. Visions of the Starship Enterprise entered my blurred skull as the horses and torque of the power plant ripped me back in my seat. It was almost incredulous, this kind of power in a near luxury automobile is unheard of. I looked over at the daredevil, her eyes were wide as baseballs. In what seemed like 3 heartbeats we had gone from 35mph to 80, the daredevil hit the brakes and smoothly and deftly the starship became a passenger car again. I sighed "We can't possibly afford this rocket" was my next thought not having looked at the sticker before climbing into the soft leather cockpit. 

We arrived back at the dealership with hair akimbo after testing a bit with the moon roof and windows open for noise which was remarkable for its quiet considering the daredevil was not quite finished with her playtime while doing so. Now I said to myself, here comes the pain. 

Euphoria overtook my body. My mind swimming in glee. My senses sharp to the point of electric pulsation. Within 11/2 hours we were standing in waiting for our newly serviced and washed pride. Having bartered and signed a deal which considering my endeavors in hell couldn't be possible. It consisted of the 2nd lowest price of the lot we had pursued. All within 11/2 hours. PAINLESS! Oh how sweet, how gentle this feeling. 

The gifted salesman went over our prize with us with not one hesitation of ignorance. He explained the loaner cars, the free wash jobs at anytime, the extended service hours, the free rides if necessary for short service times, the free soft drinks while we wait if there more than a short time and presented us with free gifts designed to match our chariot of the gods such as the Insignia CD case and multiple jeweled and inscribed key rings with the numbers of the auto service should a breakdown or lockout incur. Add to that the long list of features of this fine automobile. The salesman thanked us, the Sales Manager thanked us and introduced us to the service manager who thanked us and asked that we ask for him personally should we have any problems or suggestions for improvement, the Finance manager excused himself from another customer and rethanked us. Mind-boggling!!! What a remarkable, pleasurable experience!! All of this with a 4 year 60,000 mile warranty, 70,000 on the power train. My body was painless, my feet barely skimming the ground during my next day at work. The co-worker friend said.. you look like you are feeling better.... indeed I said, indeed.
