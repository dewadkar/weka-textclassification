            Before I purchased the Nikon I had a Minolta Dimage (aweful, but that's another review).  But I think it's important that you know that I actually despised digital cameras.  I thought that all cameras ate batteries, were impossible to connect to the computer, took a degree in rocket science to transfer pictures, and took fuzzy photographs.  

After I purchased the Nikon Coolpix 950 my attitude changed.  I am very happy with my purchase.  The camera has two modes, automatic and manual. Since I am a novice the automatic mode works perfect for me.  And as I learn more I can use the manual settings.  It's a great learning camera. 

One of my favorite features is the LCD view panel.  By twising the panel you can actually take photographs without anyone really knowing what you are doing.  To them it looks like you are watching a tv monitor or playing with the device.  I've take some great Candid photo's with this camera.  

The pictures are amazing quality.  I have yet to shoot anything in FINE mode, but let me tell you that the quality in standard mode is great.  I use a HP Photosmart printer with glossy paper and you can't tell the difference between a 35mm print and one that came from my digital camera/printer.

All in all I recommend this camera to anyone who is a bit more advanced than point and shoot and wants to have lots of fun with a camera. <br><br>
