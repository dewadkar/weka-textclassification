            I bought my 95 M3 two and a half years ago, when it had 40,000 miles on it. Today it has over 78,000 and it still drives like the day I bought it. It is by far the best handling sports sedan/coupe that I have ever driven (and that includes a lot of BMW's and MB's).

Let's talk a minute about ride comfort. My father owns a 911 Cabriolet, and I've driven that quite a bit. The M3 is not a true &quot;sports car&quot; in that it does not ride like a Porsche or a Corvette. It does however ride harder than any other sedan. It is a compromise between the two, and I might add that Road and Track said it was a perfect compromise and &quot;the best handling car in the world.&quot; Some specifics: It has 17&quot; x 7.5&quot; rims all around and comes stock with a set of MXX3 235-40's. That's a lot of rubber on the road! It will do 0-60 in about 5.5 seconds (if you don't like your transmission). And I've been told it will do the 1/4 mile in about 13.9 at 101 mph.

As for maintenance, we all fear BMW and the expenses. Well I for one believe this is a non-issue. I have spent a total of $150 on parts in the past two years. I have had the oil changed 8 times. I have had to have a taillight fixed (under warranty) and I replaced the battery at 70k miles.

The other owners are wonderfully supportive and there are plenty of resources on the Internet where you can interact with other drivers.

Why a 95? It's a collector's item. It had a special engine only available that year (3.0 liter). There were special colors not offered in the following model year (<i>like my Avus Blau</i>). They were only produced for one year; about 5,000 were produced worldwide (<i>mine is #4140</i>). They came with special wheels that were never made available again (they are 10 double spoke with the words BMW Motorsport on the face).

I hope that if you are considering buying a 1995 BMW M3 that you do. And if you do e-mail me and tell me about it!<br><br>
