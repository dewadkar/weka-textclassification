               I live in an area where the freeways are very congested, people drive like maniacs, and they do their maniacal driving in SUV's or pickups. In addition, the NAFTA has increased semi traffic on my frequently traveled corridor. These factors combined to make me terrified of driving my Plymouth Neon anywhere besides around town. I decided I needed a vehicle that would surround me with as much steel as possible without breaking my budget. After much deliberation I purchased a 1999 F150 regular cab short bed. 

   I have driven my truck over 20,000 miles in its first year and I must say it is great to be able to deal with traffic on a more equal footing. Soccer moms on cell phones in Suburbans now at least can see me, especially when they begin random lane changes. My truck isn't as big as some, but it does have more presence than what I was driving.
 
   I chose the Ford for several reasons, but mostly because of price. It was easily a thousand dollars cheaper than a similarly equipped Dodge or Chevy. It is the base model XL with a V6 and 5 speed, but has the upgraded interior package with carpet and cloth 60/40 seats, the wheel package with OWL tires and chrome wheels, lower side paint accent, A/C, cruise,tilt, chrome bumpers and tailgate lock. After dealer discount I got it for about $15,000. This only about three grand more than the Neon it replaced and is a fantastic bargain.
 
  I love the fact that I can see traffic much better than before. I can see over cars and small trucks and even some SUV's and full size trucks. This is especially useful in left turn lanes where I can see over the car in the opposite turn lane to view oncoming traffic. I can also see brake lights further ahead on the highway. It is much more maneuverable than I thought it would be and is quite easy to park and turn in tight spaces like my apartment parking lot. The ride is much better than I expected,and is actually quieter than the car I traded. The cab is roomy, especially the headroom, but is narrower than the Dodge and Chevy I tried. I would have liked the extended cab, but there was a huge jump in price. I make do with the space behind the seat and pack accordingly if I am traveling.

  I do have some dislikes however. I get about 16-17mpg which is about half of what I was getting in my Neon. Combined with current gas prices my fuel bill more than doubled, even with driving less. The back end is awfully skittish, especially on wet roads. This last winter I put several bags of gravel in the bed to try and hold the rear down when the weather got bad. The looks of the Ford take some getting used to as well. I think the Dodge and Chevy look more &quot;trucklike&quot;.

   Overall I love my F150. It more than satisfied my goal of wrapping as much mass around my precious hide as I could for as little as I could. I feel much safer on the highway now, and the versatility of a truck can't be beaten. If you are thinking of stepping up to a pickup from a car I highly recommend the Ford F150.<br><br>
