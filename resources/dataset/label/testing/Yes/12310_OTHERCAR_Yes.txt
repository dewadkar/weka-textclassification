                   This car has been made to perfection.  Even the past models of the Eclipse have been powerful, sexy and well enginered.  This car was the car of my dreams since I first laid my eyes of the first eclipse.  Since that lovly day, the cars have gotten better and better.  The early eclipse's had only one little problem, the bump.  A small raise in the hood on the driver's side.  What was it?  I think that maybe it was because the engine was to big for the car or they found that it was more aerodynamic that way.  Who knows, it could even be a privite compartment for money. 

    Anyway, I think that the Japanese have a great theory.  Instead of completly redesigning a car every year like americans, they improve bit by bit.  This means that the quality flys up because they learn from their mistakes.  This perfection idea has been a gift from god.  The version next year will be improved more and I hope they add more power but that's only a personal prefrence.  Normaly I like old cars that I can make better and fit my needs, but the Mitsubishi Eclipse caught my eye.  It had what I was looking for in a car and now all I want is a better engine.  Overall it will beat out all americans cars and will edge out those from Japan and the rest of Asia.  And you can never forget a price so low for a car so nice.  <br><br>
