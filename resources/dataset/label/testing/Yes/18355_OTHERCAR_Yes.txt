            But still flawed

I bought my first (of five) LS400, a 92, in October of 91. I will tell anyone that I have no doubts that this is the best value in this class of luxury car that exists. 

But, if you live in a cooler humid climate as is the Pacific Northwest in the wintertime then beware. There is a design flaw in the climate control system which causes/allows the windshield to spontaneously, and sometimes almost instantly, fog over. Note that I suspect that this is not a problem which is limited to Lexus. I suspect that any vehicle equipped with an &quot;AUTOMATIC&quot; NipponDenso (DENSO US) climate control system will likely exhibit this problem.

Through the winter and by the spring of 1992 I had encountered at least three very hazardous circumstances wherein my forward visibility was severely impaired by this flaw.

I suggest that owners go to extreme measures to be sure the vehicle's interior be kept as thoroughly dehumidified as is possible during the cooler months of the year
