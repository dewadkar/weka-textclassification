            I bought this Taurus used in 1996 for $ 5,800.00 with 63,000 miles on it and have had it ever since. I have kept up with the maintenance, and the car has served me well. It only left me stranded once during all these years, and even then the mechanics could not figure out what had happened. It would not do that ever again.

The car rides comfortably,and the radio works well. I am still on the original 1990 factory radio. The display has long burned out, but i have memorized all my presets!

Repairs have included: replaced alternator and battery in the fall of 1999, replaced front shocks in spring of 1999, replaced water pump in the fall of 2000, replaced a/c system in June 2001.

Considering the age of the car, it is not too bad. I have 135,000 miles on it and will drive it till it disintegrates into small particles.
