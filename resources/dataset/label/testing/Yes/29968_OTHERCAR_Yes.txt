            We have had the Dodge Grand Caravan for 2 years now.  It is great for camping and long trips.  The mileage (16 miles per gallon) is not that great.  It is real nice to have 2 back doors.  With 67 thousand miles it still handles fine and has plenty of power.  Haven't had any major trouble with it.  But the back door locks are not working properly.  The rear seat reclines all the way so the kids like to use it to kick back and sleep on trips.  The head rests are nice and the tinted back windows afford a lot of privacy.  The cruise is nice.  The grand with its extra cargo space is important for us because we have 4 kids.  We still run out of room when we are camping.  The seats are easy to release but they are heavy.  It takes a strong man with a good back to handle them alone but they serve as a nice seat that you can use when hanging around camp. 

One thing that is annoying is that the floor being so flat, things with a smooth bottom like our auto first aid kit slide around.  We had to upgrade the stereo because the standard issue one was severely lacking.  I never drove a big car before and it makes parking and turning around kind of a hassle but you get used to it.  I wish the drivers sead was a little more ergonomic and had better back support but overall it's pretty comfortable and holds up on long drives.  <br><br>
