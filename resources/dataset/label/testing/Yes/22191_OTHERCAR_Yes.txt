            I bought the 3400 as a replacement for my Kodak DC240, mainly because I wanted the higher quality.  The DC3400 gives images that print out up to 8X10 (on a good printer) that you have to be a foot or so away from to tell they're not from film (on glossy paper - on plain paper, it's easy to tell).

A big plus of the DC3400 is the inclusion of both an optical viewfinder and LCD screen.  When taking pictures, I almost always use the optical viewfinder, since it zooms right along with the lens, and is a very good representation of what will be in the frame.

The camera is easy to use.  It won't take you any longer to learn how to use it than you'd take with a regular film point-and-shoot camera (probably about 10 minutes).  The main dial and buttons on the back of the camera are well-positioned and their functions are pretty intuitive.

There are 3 main downsides (albeit small ones) I've found:

1.  The optical zoom is only 2X.  I would have preferred a 3X zoom, like my old DC240 had.

2.  The LCD screen can be a bit hard to see in some daylight conditions.

3.  The 8MB compact flash card that comes with the camera is too small if you're taking high-quality pictures.  I had to go to a 64MB card, which lets me get about 100 images on a card at the highest quality.  The 8MB card would probably hold about 12-13 images.
