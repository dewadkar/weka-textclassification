            When I purchased my 2000 Rodeo LS, I received great financing and great customer service at my dealership (Jack Miller Isuzu in Kansas City, MO). The v-6 power that this SUV has is wonderful! Can't compete with my previous vehicle, the Suzuki Vitara. Seats are very comfortable and the interior is laid out very well. The Rodeo LS is so well built, that my insurance actually decreased from my previously owned vehicle. It is a car that I feel very safe in. The 6-CD changer mounted in the dash is great and gives a really wonderful audio experience. I just love to drive my Rodeo. The downside here is twofold: first, it is a noisy vehicle, in that at higher interstate speeds you hear the wind and hear it loud! Second, the gas mileage is not what I had hoped. I am getting a combined city/highway mpg of only 18. Was counting on closer to 20 mpg. Overall, I am very happy with this SUV and I feel that Isuzu has made a fine vehicle.
