            Well I've been driving a 1997 BMW 528i for about 3 years now, but to save money my only choice now is the Accord Coupe EX V6. The BMW is perfect. Everything is just right. Quiet, quick, gorgeous, holds the road, turns the heads. It's the perfect car in every aspect. So, I wanted to save some money, and I set out to find something comparable for half the price. Jetta: lots of features, but rides like a rock, and it's too small; engine is not refined. Passat: lots of features, but rides like a boat (surprising); engine feels like it struggles above 4000 RPM and is unrefined. Solara: yuck! Accord Coupe: Wow. Quiet, smooth engine, quick, well balanced, distinctive back end; missing some features (rain-sensing wipers, heated seats) but it's worth every penny.<br><br>
