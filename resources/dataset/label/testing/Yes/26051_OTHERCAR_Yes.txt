            this is a well built sport utility vehicle-plenty of room and alot of extras- nice shape too--can handle off road with no trouble --V6 with very good gas mileage-very reliabilty--only oil change service--engine so quiet its hard to tell if its turned on--fold up rear seats--all seats lay down for sleeping--handles throughout making it easy getting into--tool box in door--crank for sun roof incase of power failure. lighting outlet with light in rear area--locking mag wheels--lots of storage space   <br><br>
