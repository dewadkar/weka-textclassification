To the tune of &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&quot;:

The Audi lies dead in the driveway,
The timing chain tore through the Benz,
My son has the Volvo for surfing,
We're borrowing rides from our friends.

Yep, time to get a new car.  The truck was useful.  The Volvo was safe and trendy, too, at the time. The Audi...I don't want to talk about the Audi.  I basically needed air conditioning in this hot Southern California climate, and I would be happy if the air conditioning had a functioning car wrapped around it.  Since that was a necessity, I demanded a luxury car this time.  

Well, it was a lust thing.  We took a peek at the LHS and went back the following week and purchased it.  In between looking and buying, we asked around.  It narrowed to three choices:  A Grand Prix, a Mustang, and the LHS.  Mustang ruled out immediately; Grand Prix got high praise, and the LHS definitely had its owners under some sort of spell.

We were looking for a quiet car with power, a snazzy look, and above all, comfort for our passengers (too many complaints from the back seat on our long drives). We were pleased on ALL matters!

I know Chrysler has had an image problem over the years, but they are remedying that big time, and the 2000 LHS is certainly a part of that remedy. The 253 V-6 engine is plenty powerful for getting out of scrapes or passing the trucks on an uphill ramp.  Mileage is not too bad; the first tank of gas gave us 25 miles per gallon.  The car is a big car, but handles like a small car.  Easiest transition into a new car's handling that I've experienced.

It's front-wheel drive, a plus in mudslide weather.  However, unlike other cars, this engine sits straight, not sideways. The engine, however, fits so tightly into the compartment that I asked if they needed to pull the engine in order to change a park plug.  The answer?  &quot;Just about.&quot;  I purchased an extended warranty just in case.

Okay, now on to the goodies:  The interior is lush and comfortable.  The leather seats are a little harder than most cars, but IMO this is an advantage as far as positioning your keester for a long ride.  Add wool clothing, and a seat like that is a definite advantage.  The leather trim in the car as well as the people-contact portions of the seat are very difficult to distinguish from the rest of the seating material; it looks like leather throughout.  The programmable seats are a definite plus; two different drivers can program not only their seat positions but also both side mirror positions and their favorite radio settings.  Two different seat heater settings.  The dashboard is very pleasing to the eye; more importantly, the gauges are easily visible.  No ducking or maneuvering to see the gauges around the steering wheel.  Ours came with an Infinity sound system and a 5-CD changer...right up front, not in the trunk as seems to be the trend nowadays.  The sound is great, with an equalizer that can make the bass tones shake the windows.  Aha!!! Revenge is mine, I thought; payback time!  I drive into our neighborhood with the thing cranked up full, boom box rattling my contact lenses off of my corneas.  Problem is, nobody heard it because the car is too well insulated.  All four windows and sunroof to be wide open next time.

Yes, our LHS has a sunroof.  A BIG plus is not guessing when to stop closing the thing; how many of you have tried to slide the sunroof closed just to overshoot and tilt it up in back?  This has a separate button dedicated to &quot;close&quot; only.  No guessing or wondering. 

The back seats are roomy.  We actually sat in them before driving the vehicle; it's important to us for our passengers to be comfortable.  The visibility is good from the back seat, important in preventing car sickness.  The same luxurious leather seating is there; the center console is a big plus, clean lines, uncomplicated, uncluttered-looking, large storage space.  It folds back for a third person to sit there; otherwise, a comfortable and wide armrest for two.  There are separate air conditioning controls for the back seat.  On our test drive, the salesman--a 6'2&quot; rather beefy fellow--had plenty of leg room and head room.  We were impressed. 

The trunk.  My, oh my.  I have never seen a trunk that big; even has a netting across to hold things toward the back.  I think that's what it's for; could be a tennis net, as the thing is big enough to play tennis in.  (We're renting it out for $350 a month to help with the car payments.  The family that lives there is quite nice.)

There are a lot of other fancy little details; the automatic &quot;brights&quot; setting for the rear-view mirror, the little computerized display that tells you what your mileage is per gallon (what, we can't divide?), the direction indicator (IMO, if I don't know whether I'm driving north or south, perhaps I shouldn't be driving), etc.  Fun, but only for the kids to show off to their friends.  Or my husband to his.  

So far, no complaints whatsoever.  We had a good bargain, as it is a 2000 model and they have the 2001s ready for sale.  A bit pricier than we were prepared for...but as I said, it was a lust thing.

<b>11/16/00   I'm still driving it.  I'm still loving it!</b>

The machine screams.  0-60 in the blink of an eye.  Actually, not sure of that...did I pass 70, officer?  Never actually stopped at 60.  I think it's something just short of 5 seconds.  Uphill.  I can confidently pass trucks on a grade, though it took me some time to gauge the speed in approaching traffic ahead of me after powering past a truck.  Can a car be too fast?  Nah.

The heated seats?  Not just the seat bottom...the lumbar support area, actually sacral to lower thoracic area, also heats.  Two heat levels.  Pure comfort.  It feels sooooo good.  My husband and I just go out to the car and sit in the heated seats for 20 minutes a night.  Foreplay substitute.  With the temperatures dipping down into the 20s, this feature has actually become one of the most appreciated.

Averaging about 20 mpg, city and highway driving combined.  This could be because of the lead foot of the primary driver (me).  The car just rolls...you accelerate to your desired speed, take your foot off the pedal, and it just keeps rolling...smooooooth.  So, why only 20 mpg?  See above.  It can get 25 mpg with a different driver.

The interior I love more and more each day. It is actually <i>almost</i> black.  It is a soft look, a luxurious feel, a comfortable environment.  Of course, the black dashboard reflects very little light onto the windshield, so visibility is fine.

It took three weeks before I realized there is no visible antenna.  It is incorporated into the rear window of the car, but reception is top notch...even in the high-interference areas, I experience minimal interruption.

As in most American cars I've driven, there have been a few rattles or vibrations that revealed themselves.  As you probably know, it can drive one crazy trying to isolate these noises, very dangerous when you're driving.  I finally did isolate the most irritating one, and it was the &quot;panic handle&quot; over the passenger's seat.  A simple push back into place cured that.  The other one is hiding somewhere in the recesses of one of the vents.  The radio drowns it out.

I've decided that the trunk is too big.  No matter what you put in there, it has plenty of room to shift back and forth, and the net will not really keep anything heavy from shifting. Hint:  Don't leave a bottle of water in the trunk.  I know all that space will come in handy soon enough.

Parking is extremely easy; parallel parking is a snap because the front of the car is relatively short.  The front end maneuvers into place easily, even in parking spaces with two greedy vehicles on each side.  It does not have a very small turning radius, but in most streets, even residential, it can make a U-turn if you utilize every bit of space.  No problem at intersections (those that allow U-turns, naturally!).

So far, everything works and no electric doodads (of which there are plenty) have failed or even hiccupped.  Stay tuned!<br><br>
