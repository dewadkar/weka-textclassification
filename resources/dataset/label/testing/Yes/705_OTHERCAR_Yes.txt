            After a lot of web-surfing and soul-searching, I decided to go in for the Nikon 950 digital camera from http://www.pcWonders.com for $802 (including everything). In addition, I also bought a 48 MB Compact flash card, an AC adaptor, a SanDisk CF USB reader, and NiMH charger for about $200 from http://www.buy.com.

I've been using it for a month now, and am absolutely thrilled with it. The pictures have superb quality and the camera offers a whole range of features and manual controls for virtually everything.

There's even a site called http://www.printroom.com that prints the JPGS at reasonable rates.

There's a camera-to-TV cable using which you can watch all the pictures on your TV as a slide-show and can even use the 950 as a video camera and record using your VCR!

No longer do we have to wait to see how the photo looks after processing - find out immediately on the spot! The possibilities are endless. A must-have for all camera-enthusiasts.
