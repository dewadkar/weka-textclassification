            Pros-
I bought my '97 Honda Accord as my first car for $8,000, which was a steal considering how great it has been for me.   As a first car I wanted something very reliable yet affordable, so immediately I knew I wanted a used car.  I knew a few people who owned an Accord and were very happy with it, never had any problems out of it.  Even before I had talked to other people, I liked the looks of the Accord, and this just reinforced my love for it.  At first I wanted a 90-93 model but I couldn't find one that had low enough mileage on it for what I was looking for, and hardly any were for sale.  So then I started looking at my next choice, 94-97 model.  When I found my car it had around 80,000 miles on it, which was quite a lot, for the year, but I couldn't turn it down, the price was so good, and I fell in love with it, and after three years I'm still in love with it.  It might have a few small dents in it, and high mileage, but I haven't had any problems out of it at all, it's so comfortable, and I'm only in college for gosh sakes, I don't need a Cadillac.  I used to think I would want to buy a new car when I got out of school, but I would be crazy to sale my accord, the only thing better than this car would be a new accord.  It would perfect to comfortably accommodate a family of four, and vacations where you have to pack a lot of things,(it has a huge trunk).  So not only is this a wonderful first car for a teenager, but it would also be a great family car, you might could say it's a car for everyone.  I am looking forward to many more years (and miles) with my Accord.  One thing to always know when your looking for used Accords, you find more of them on the road than you find in sales lots, this always says something about a car.  This fact says that the car is reliable, and people are happy enough with it to keep it for as long as it's running.  That's what I intend to do.
Cons-
The only thing I think I might want to change about the car is the location of it's interior equipment.  Where the clock is located, you have to look down to see it, it would be better if you didn't have to take your eyes off the road to glance at the clock.  The cup holders, instead of like most cars having their cup holders directly below the center of the dashboard controls, the accord has the cup holders right where most women would put their hand bags, or in other words, right between the two seats, which is inconvenient for the driver.
