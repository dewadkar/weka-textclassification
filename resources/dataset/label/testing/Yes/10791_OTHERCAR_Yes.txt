            I have a '99 3/4 ton GMC Suburban K2500 with the 6.5 Liter Diesel assigned to me at my job (FDNY EMS). It is used as a command vehicle in the South Bronx. All I can say (or Rave) is it gets the daylights beaten out of it daily driving with the lights and sirens on rushing to emergencies throughout some of the toughest and well worn streets in the world and comes back for more. It is like driving the Baja 500, you know, the one Ivan 'The Iron Man' Stewart races in. At the hands of a skilled driver, it will bop and weave in the toughest, most unyeilding traffic available. This truck makes over 200 emergency responses a week, yet it still drives and handles like new! 

I know there are others who believe that their truck is better for one reason of the other, but, let's face it, this truck is punished for a living. There are 9 members who drive this vehicle regularly. Each has their own driving style, some are exceptionally hard on this vehicle.

The Diesel accelerates like a small-block engine (a drawback) but will pull down a house if needed. Now for the other drawbacks: there are a few.

1) This truck is long !

2) This is a real truck (for those of you who are interested in a 'cushy' ride, this isn't it) It handles like a truck, and stops like a truck.

3) A serious amount of coin is required to join the club.

However, no other truck has so impressed me that I would save almost $20,000 for a down payment. Also, it has had a positive effect on morale since it was delivered (we used to have a '95 Bronco), so much so that I even look forward to going to work (sometimes).

So, if this the type of truck you are looking for, get thee to a local GMC dealership and get one. TODAY!<br><br>
