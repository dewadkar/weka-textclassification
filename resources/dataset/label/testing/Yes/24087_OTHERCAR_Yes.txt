            My husband and I just purchased this camera for the most part to use for taking pictures and listing items on Ebay the auction house here on the web.
I came to our home in less than a week packaged very well and with a very easy to use instruction booklet, and all the extras needed to get busy. The lithium battery, the memory card, the port cable and the battery charger, and carrying case.
The software was simple to install and after reading though and taking some practice shots I think we've got it!!
I camera has nice resolution for no more that it has on board, the pictures I feel are very good quality, as we are not pros and looking to make a living off of using this camera.
I recommend this camera for the simple reason its easy and inexpensive and you're not breaking the bank or your sanity in using this camera.
I truly have nothing bad to say about it.....sorry &gt;:)<br><br>
