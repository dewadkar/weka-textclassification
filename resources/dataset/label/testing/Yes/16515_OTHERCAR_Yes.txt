            <b>This is my first car ever!.</b>
 I bought it straight out of grad school. It had 68K miles. The only modifications the previous driver had made were a JVC CD changer. I drove this car till about 2 months back when it got totalled. I found out the hard way that you should never stop at amber in a Houston traffic light!


<b>EXTERIOR: 8</b>
The exterior is kind of boxy shaped but I still prefer this shape over the new jettas. The paint job was excellent and the car never looked its' age. The only hassle is the fuel door is on the passenger side.

<b>INTERIOR:6</b>
The interior was pretty good for a car at this price. The seats atleast the driver and front passenger ones were easily adjustable and had decent bolstering. The cup holders were not built for North America. Nothing bigger than a coke can would fit. The trunk space is <b> AWESOME</b> and the rear seats were fold back so the cargo carrying capacity is really impressive.The rear seats even have a center rest!. My only complaint is that the rear seat legroom is kind of cramped especially if the driver has his/her seat pushed all the way back.

<b>ENGINE & TRANSMISSION:8</b>
Sometimes you don't need gobs of power to have a good time in a car, or truck.The 2.0L liter is not exactly a "bahnstormer" but is more than adequate with the 5 speed.
The engine redlines just over 6,000 rpm. Peak horsepower is made high in the 2.0-liter four's rev range; 115 horses are generated at 5,400 rpm. Peak torque is made much lower, measuring 122 lbs.-ft. at 3,200 rpm. As a result, the Jetta bogs if not revved up at launch, then pulls strongly to 5,500 rpm. The stick shift is a bit rubbery and if you are new to the car you might get confused between first and third gears. But it is not so bad once you get used to the car. The clutch has a lot of play but this seems to be an issue with all VW ( I had driven the new passats/jetta and they have the same problem). Steering is almost razor sharp and very communicative.The fuel economy is pretty good (not as good as the Civic) 28-32mpg varies depending on city/hwy and A/C usage.

<b>RIDE & HANDLING:7</b>
Pretty quiet ride.Does not soak up all the bumps. The handling with the OEM shocks was not remarkable either. I upgraded to Bilstein shocks and what a difference it made! Almost no body roll and I could take corners at much higher speeds. Originally had Firestones on this car, replaced them with Kumho Ecsta supras (need another review for that) which were way better than the Firestones.

<b>VALUE:7</b>
I am assuming that someone looking to buy this car would be cross shopping against a Civic, Integra(if you can fork some more money), Sentra, etc. The jetta is more "non" mundane than the others but it has it's share of quirks. The power windows on my rear passenger side suddenly stopped and it cost about 250$ to replace. Maintenance issues usually cost more when compared to a Japanese car. So if you are buying a used car, you might want to take it to a mechanice for a thorough inspection.

<b>THE VERDICT:Excellent first car</b>
If you are single, in your first job looking for a decent used car with some pizazz then the Jetta is the car for you.
