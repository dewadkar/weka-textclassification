            Unfortunatley I can not afford a Viper without taking a ridiculously large loan from the bank which I dont intend to do any time soon.  This is your definite pimp car if you ask me.  You can take this car to the most elegant restraunts without a hitch.  Not to mention taking it down any neighborhood street and getting double takes.  I have only been able to test drive this car.  But man if I did have the money to buy this work of art I truly would.  One problem I did have was the fact that the seat hurts your back after a while.  It doesn't have any lumbar support.  This is not a major problem but something to keep in mind if you have any sort of back problems.  Other then that this 400HP monster is all you could ever want in a sports car.  The modern day 427 cobra as some might call it.  With its V10 and 400 ft/lbs of torque.  <br><br>
