            I've owned the Olympus Brio D100 for about six months now and it has quickly become my favorite camera.  Rather than picking up other digital cameras that are bulkier or more complicated, I tend to go for the Brio because it takes quality pix with a point and shoot and fits in a shirt pocket (it is smaller than a bar of soap.)  I don't even buy film for my non-digital cameras - - they are just collecting dust.
The pictures from this camera are outstanding.  Clear, clean, with correct coloration.  Whether you are looking to exchange pix online or print them out, you'll love the quality of these images.  And the camera's automatic selections can be overridden via menu selections should you wish to force changes in lighting, etc.
With a 128mb smartmedia card, I can get over 100 hq photos without changing media.  The onboard view screen and telephoto/wide lense controls are simple and intuitive and work pretty much the same way across the entire Olympus line.
Battery life is excellent so long as you buy good quality lithium photo batteries.  The batteries that came with the camera got me through hundreds photos.  This is amazing considering my very first digital camera, a Minolta Dimage V, got about 5 flash shots per set of batteries!!
Overall, I'd say this camera represents bang for the buck that is hard to beat and is a great compromise on price/quality/ease of use.
