We picked up our Rodeo as a &quot;program&quot; car.  I'm not really sure what that means other than it had about 7,000 miles on it, and it was in great condition.

Overall, we are really excited about it, and have had it for about a year.  However, we did have problems with a couple of minor items.

One was the cup holder in the back of the center console.  It kept falling out of place.  It wasn't anything terrible, just cosmetic.  

The other problem was a little ridiculous.  We couldn't get a spare part for the airbag, and wound up having it stay in the shop for three weeks.  

But the dealer was great and we had a red convertible Camero to cover us.   Plus, after I asked,  they tinted the windows, and threw in an in-dash 6-disc CD player. Very Nice!

The rear window defogger also works only part-time, but I don't care, I love the truck.

It's got 205hp and a cool &quot;Power&quot; button on the center console to press, for those, I-need-to-get-on-a-Dallas-Tollway moments.

Other than the initial three week hiatus, it's been fantastic, I'd definitely recommend one to my own parents / friends.
