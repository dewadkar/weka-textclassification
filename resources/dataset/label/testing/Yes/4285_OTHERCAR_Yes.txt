            I just received my new company car: a yellow beetle.

Oh baby. 

I've only driven it for half an hour or so, but I am now firmly convinced that I've never driven a REAL car before.

Nice handling.
Well-designed interior. Jeez, I think Donald Norman would even like it.
Adjustable seats (very important to a little 5' 2&quot; person like me).
Amazingly tight construction - witness the sound difference when you close the windows.
And speaking of sound, great radio, mmm and a cd changer and hey! cool! a cassette player too! I can listen to those tapes that have been languishing in the cupboard!
Oh and a big trunk too.

Aaah. What a car.

I think I need to go run some errands and do a little more research. ;)

********************************************

A week and a half later, I can report that I am only more impressed by this vehicle. It handles great, is wonderfully customizable for comfort for both a 5'2&quot; and a 6' driver, and the stereo is very good.

I got stuck in a bad storm on the Jenner Grade in Mendocino county. This is a very steep climb up the cliffs of the northern California coastline and is tiring to drive under the best of conditions. In bucketing rain and wind, it's one of the last places you'd want to be driving (except about 2 miles further on when you've got a mile drop to Pacific Ocean). The New Beetle performed admirably: solid grip on the road, virtually unaffected by wind, powerful wipers and an extremely capable defrost system which maintained interior visibility without requiring chilling the occupants of the car. 

I made it up to the top of the grade and immediately headed into an inland route. The storm did not abate and I finally decided to pull over and wait it out. I can report that, if you're 5'2&quot;, it is possible to sleep for over an hour in the back seat of a New Beetle. It ain't the most comfortable place I've been, but at least the car retained most of its heat during my nap. I'd say that next time I'll fold down the back seat and really stretch out in the ample storage space, but, frankly, I'm just not going driving in that sort of weather ever again. 

The VW New Beetle: Anti-lock Braking System, front and side airbags, aerodynamic design, adjustable wiper blades, good tires, capable of but not recommended for overnight stays.<br><br>
