            I have a Rav4 1997 and it's by far the most dependable car I have driven.I drive alot for work &amp; pleasure the Rav is very comfortable,good gas millage great cargo space with swing open back door good ergonomic design.I would get another when it's time to trade. I love the handling on all road sufaces in all weather.Long trips are more enjoyable now that I have better comfort,and depedable performance.  I like the built in alarm gives me peace of mind when in the city .I think if you travel for work the Rav will serve you well. Why not test drive one today. <br><br>
