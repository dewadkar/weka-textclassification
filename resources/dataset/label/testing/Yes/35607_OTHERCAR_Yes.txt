            This is a great car for the price.  You get everything and then some for one price.  

We were looking for a good family car with 4 doors and we just couldn't pass up this deal.  Everything was standard on this car; we didn't need to add any options.  

Any one looking for a mid-sized car should definitely make this car a consideration.  There is plenty of legroom in the front and the back.  The cup holders in the back are shaped for boxed juices as well as cans.  I thought this was a neat feature for kids.

We did have a problem with our turn signal, driver side window, and battery.  All were taken care of without a problem at our dealer.  They were very nice about the whole thing and we also got a rental.
