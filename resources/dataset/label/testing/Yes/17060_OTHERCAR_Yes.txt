            I previously owned a Land Rover, and, although it was a lot of fun to drive around in, it had problems. lots of problems. Traded it in for an Audi in June 2000. My father has an A6, and previously had an Audi, so mine is the 3rd in the family and 13th on the street. 

I researched the vehicle before purchasing it-- It was a Jersey car where the only visits to the shop were for the regular checkup. I just passed 50,000 miles (I've put about 12k on it), and have had absolutely no troubles at all. My father's Audis have been the same way. (his last was going strong at 165k mi when he got hit by a Tahoe at 65 mph. he walked away from the accident, by the way) 

The Quattro 4 wheel drive is absolutely breath taking. Honestly I think it was better than my SUV. Living in upstate New York, Quattro is needed just about every day in the winter, and it performs outstandingly.

 Long trips have been so easy in the A4-- quiet, smooth, fast, comfortable. To get to school I have to drive 12 hours, so trust me, I know long trips in single days. 

Commuters would love this vehicle... I wouldn't say it's a family car-- go for an Audi wagon. If you're at all thinking of modifying this car (like chips to the engine) get a 1.8T, NOT a 2.8. Next car? Another Audi. Maybe a new-model A4, or TT Roadster....but that could be a long time from now. unless a Tahoe hits me.<br><br>
