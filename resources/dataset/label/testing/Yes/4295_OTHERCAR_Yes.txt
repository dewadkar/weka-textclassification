            Ghostly because it is the color blue turns when it sees a ghost!  It looks white in sunlight but a milky blue gray on cloudy days.

I purchased a Vapor Beetle on the Internet.  After test driving one I was fairly sure that I wanted it. When the Vapor and Reflux became available, I decided to take the plunge. I'd been interested in the new Beetle for two years which is something to a person who doesn't especially like driving.

The closest seller contacted me by e-mail. Before being contacted by the closest dealer I had already chosen my interior color and other options. The Vapor has the luxury package.  Even after the car was delivered, I was not forced to purchase.  Actually, this comment is also a plus for buying on the Internet.

There is nothing I hate about this car.  It is absolutely HUGE!  It is cute and looks like a toy but it is wider than my husband's Escort and my old Metro.  It has ALL the luxuries, even heated seats, a leather interior and also a sunroof, AC, radio, tape player, automatic steering, and rides like a cloud. The gas tank holds 14.5 gallons.  The steering wheel is adjustable, as are the seats; both back and forth and up and down. I also like the fact that we were able to put shorter headrests on the back of the front seats plus the adjustable seat belts for taller or shorter persons. I like the time and temperature that is available and also the lighted vanity mirrors.  

I wouldn't mind better mileage but know one can't expect the best with automatic drive and mainly city driving.  On the road we got 28 miles per gallon.  Blind spots are caused by the wide posts in front and the side view mirrors are a bit high and can't be moved down.  The ability to see behind me when I back up makes up for this minus.  This was one reason I became interested in the Beetle in the first place.  The rear end doesn't point up like just about every other auto made.

It came with a video and a book that tells all its features and how to use them.  It also has front and side airbags and is considered the safest compact made.   Almost forgot to mention that it is all electric - doors, locks, windows.

This &quot;Bug&quot; would suit both tall people and short people and also fat people and thin people.  Everything is adjustable.
