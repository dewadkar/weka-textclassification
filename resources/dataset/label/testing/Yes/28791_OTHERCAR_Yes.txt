            The Chevrolet Lumina is an awesome family car. With it's extras the Lumina could easily be a mothers &quot;dream&quot; car. But for me the most important thing a car could offer is safety. I owned a Chevy Lumina, and when I was hit in the rear end by a ton truck it did some damage to the car but not to me or my children who were riding in the back seat. The Lumina scored four stars in my crash test. If your family is in the market for a new vehicle I strongly suggest a Lumina. Not only because of the safety I feel it provides but also because of what I call the child proof interior. My kids eat, drink, play, and fight in the car. This can do some damage to headliners, seats and even the carpet. In my expierence the Lumina held up perfectly to everyday wear and tear as well as the added wear my children add. Another thing that sold me on the Lumina was how spacious it is, not only the inside of the car but the trunk as well.I had no problem hauling strollers, diaper bags, playpins, and just about anything else I want to stick in the trunk. The inside of the car can easily and comfortably seat five adults or four adults and two children. Aside from these family pluses I also found that a Lumina handles excellently and rides like a dream. So if you are in the market for a new vehicle do yourself a favor and take a Chevy Lumina for a spin. Oh and just as an added bonus you can get a new Lumina for around $17,000.
