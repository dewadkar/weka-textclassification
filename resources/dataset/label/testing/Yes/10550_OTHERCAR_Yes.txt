            I had a '91 Chevrolet Camaro before we bought our '96 Plymouth Voyager, and I wasn't a family car person.  We had to get a bigger vehicle due to the fact our third child was on it's way.  A Camaro only sits four, and with number five on his way, we had to go shopping for &quot;the family car&quot; right away.  My husband wanted a Chevrolet Astro Van, but, my mom owned one and it drove like a truck, and I didn't want to feel I was driving a truck.  We test drove the Plymouth Voyager and I feel in love with it at first sight.  The thing I liked the most was the two child restraint seats already in the first long seat.  We wouldn't have to buy another car seat, and we could hide the seats when they weren't being used so, we could go out on dates and not feel like we are always surrounded by the children.  It also drives like a car, I almost felt like I was driving a Honda.  It turns on a dime and can get into tight fitting spaces with ease. It has pick up like a sports car and I don't miss my Camaro at all.  You can also take the seats out with one step and make more room for luggage.  We took the seat out with the child restraint seats in it and pulled the back seat up and put the old child restraint seats in and had enough room for our luggage for a month.  I am very proud to say that I'm ready to trade my '96 in for a 2000 model and can't wait to see what changes they have made.  I hope very little, because it is too perfect the way it is now. <br><br>
