            We traded in a van to buy our Echo and I was terrified with the all of the space we were losing.  I was amazed at the amount of room there is inside of this little car.  Plus, with the way that the seats are raised, it is one of the easiest cars I've seen to get in and out of - basically just step out through the door.  

It handles so very easily.  In fact, I've almost starting enjoying driving again!  We get approximately 37 mpg - and this is great after getting about 10mpg with our van.  

There is ample space in the trunk - in fact, we've been able to fit much more in there than my daughter can in their Explorer.  The one thing that I miss the most though is the amount of passenger room.  There are times when I would like for us all to travel as a family, but with my husband and myself in the front seat ... and the grandchildren in the back in car seats, there just isn't any room for anyone else.  

But, this is a very small price to pay in exchange for all the very positive features that it does have!  Needless to say, I've been very impressed with it.<br><br>
