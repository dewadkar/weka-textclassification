            Boy, I wish my parents had "forced" this vehicle upon me back when I was at the age when my parents might have bought me a vehicle! (See other reviews)  This is a wonderful and versatile vehicle!  We bought this used two years ago, and it now has 80,000 miles on it. The only problems have been the typical things...brakes, exhaust, tires, battery...that start to go in "middle age".  Before this, we owned an 88 Isuzu Trooper which I adored. This vehicle puts the Trooper to shame. It drives better in all types of conditions...rain, snow, highway, offroad. It's more solidly made...the Trooper always needed something tightened and I lived with constant rattles. This is very quiet for a big SUV.  Our family loves the third row of seats that raise up out of the way. A great feature!! Perfect for a family of four, when the kids bring a friend. We own a camper, a large one, and the Montero hauls it with ease, again, much better then the Trooper ever did.  We also love the on-the-fly  4 wheel drive, and the ease of switching. If you get the sunroof, it is AWESOME. When it's open, we joke that we are in the Pope-mobile. It's got to be the biggest sunroof made!!!  The only negatives are the cheap wheel hubcap thingies, and the heating system isn't quite adequate on those REALLY cold NH mornings. Front is fine, but it takes a while to reach the back. Same thing, obviously, with the AC on super hot days. If you get the chance to buy one of these babies, buy it.
