              Let me just start off by saying this is one hell of a safe car. I do not own one but my dad has 4 of them a 1990, 1994, 1997, and a 1999. I've driven them plenty of times, so I know what they are like. Three months ago my dad ran into a guy that took a left turn to slow. He hit him around 45-50 mph. Figuring he ran into a fullsize truck, I was suprised he didn't even have a scratch on him. The car was totaled, so insurance gave him the money to buy a 99 Taurus. We still have the 94, but my dad uses that on his mail route. The 99, is not much different from the 97, except for a little interior changes. I still wish he would have waited to buy the restyled 2000. It is a very comfortable car with everything in the right places. It has the Vulcan 3.0L V6. Decent power, but not overwhelming. Never had any major problems with any of Taurus's. The 97 and 99 have been exceptionaly reliable. The only major gripes I have would be the love it or hate it styling. It may not be the best midsize car on the market, but it is a good value with five star safety.<br><br>
