                  <b>W</b>hen I first saw the Pontiac Vibe GT, I honestly thought it was the new SVT Focus Wagon. In-fact, I said to my friend who was with me car shopping, "I didn't know the Focus SVT came in wagon form" (which it doesn't).  This was said from a relatively far distance of course, so I can't be too much to blame. The Pontiac Vibe is an all new model for 2003 which shares its platform with the Toyota Corolla and <a href="/content_79551499908"> Toyota Matrix</a>, and although it's not a poorly made car/SUV/minivan (also known as a wagon) it could do with some slight improvements; powertrain especially. 

   <b>F</b>or 2003 the Pontiac Vibe comes in 3 models which I imagine all have their own unique character, I can only comment personally on one; The GT. The Vibe Comes in base trim with a 1.8 liter, 130 horsepower VVT-I engine, an AWD model which comes with a 123 horsepower, de-tuned version of the base engine, and the GT (my test car) which comes with a high revving 1.8 liter VVTL-I (variable valve timing with lift and intelligence) engine (same engine that's in the <a href="/content_62400073348"> Celica GT-S</a>) which pumps out 180 horsepower at 7,600 RPM, and 130 lb-ft of torque at 6,800 RPM. This may sound impressive for a 1.8 liter 4-cylinder, and it is, but perhaps a car that was designed for hauling people and cargo deserves a larger displacement 4-cylinder, or even a small rev-happy V6.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

   Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> comes slightly slow at first, but once the revs pick up the car picks up speed extremely fast, and with the RPM comes an exhaust note from 'little engine racer heaven.' Since the engine and transmission is from the Celica GT-S, it performs in a straight line almost the exact same way, except a little slower due to the heavier curb weight. I have to say that after owning a <a href="/content_54917172868"> Sunfire GT</a> for a few months now, it seems very strange to see the tachometer in a car go from 650 RPM to 8,000 RPM with such ease. 
The 6-speed manual transmission also shifts with ease, although I did have some trouble getting it in a few of the gears (dealer said it was "normal"). All-in-all the Vibe's transmission did a good job keeping the car's RPM in a range where I had enough power on tap to accelerate without having to floor the gas pedal. 

<b>Handling</b> is very good, The suspension is relatively sporty and allows for a fun drive on laigh valley roads. There is  plenty of grip from the tires, and light work is made of sharp curves in the road. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the Vibe GT is not really lackluster, but I didn't find passing power that great in 6th gear whatsoever, the <a href="/content_77172674180"> 2003 Sentra 2.5</a> has much better passing power abilitiy. The 2003 Pontiac Vibe takes bumps with ease, but is affected by wind, and most of all engine noise at speeds above 65 MPH. 
Hill climbing is good, like the Celica GT-S, a down-shift from 6th gear to 5th sends the Vibe GT up the steepest inclines, but not without hearing the engine 'vrrooom' the entire time. I'm sure this will be music to most teen's, and even many adult's ears. 

<b>Braking</b> in the 2003 Vibe is above average, but not excellent. The 4-wheel disc brakes matched with 4-wheel ABS did a good job stopping this vehicle, but I have seen better braking performance from non ABS set-ups. The Vibe GT gets about 28-29 <b>MPG</b> on the freeway, this is about what most V6 powered cars get on the road. 

<b>Performance gripes:</b> What's with the Vibe AWD version having the least powerful engine? Did Toyota and Pontiac think the heaviest car in its Vibe/Matrix line-up needed the most anemic engine? Weighing 3,000  lbs, 123 horse power just is not going to cut it, at least not for smooth cruising. As for the GT, give me some more power at a reasonable RPM. 180 horse power is excellent for a car in this segment, but this power reached at a lower RPM would be better suited for this vehicle.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the Vibe GT is very modern. The dash is really what makes the interior of this vehicle look futuristic, from the Olympic ring style gauges, to the round shaped air vents. Ergonomics are excellent, and the high drivers position allows for excellent outward vision. Standard amenities in the Vibe GT are generous, AC with air filtration system, 2 cup holders, cruise control, 2 12 volt power outlets, tilt, dual front air bags, an outside temperature gauge, and a thick leather wrapped steering wheel are to name a few. Optional amenities on my test car included, power everything, remote keyless entry, an excellent sounding 200 watt sound system, side air bags, and sunroof. A navigation system is available, but not Vibe's equipped with the sunroof, which seems strange to me but I'm sure there is a simple reason behind it (keeping cost down maybe?). The seats are made out of cloth. These seats are kinda stiff but do offer adequate support, and the driver has height adjustments. Room is more than adequate for 5 adults, rear leg room is a little cramped, but the high roofline makes it feel like you are in a much larger car, kinda like the Toyota Echo. 

<b>Storage space</b> is excellent, the rear sets fold down, and so does the front. Even with all the seats up there is plenty of room for almost anything you would need for a camping trip.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> of the 2003 Pontiac Vibe GT is not really the most original design, but it does boast a handsome alternative to the Matrix. The Vibe has an 'all Pontiac, Aztec looking' front fascia. The lines of this vehicle are very edgy, much like a Ford Focus. The Vibe GT comes standard with 16" alloy rims, although 17" alloys are optional. The rear of the Vibe GT is almost square, but is incorporated very well to fit the design theme of this vehicle. Front and rear Fog lamps are also standard which add a little sport to this wagon. 

 <i>Price & Warranty:</i>

The base priced Pontiac Vibe GT runs around $20,000. The sticker price on my tester was almost $23,000 with the options I mentioned. Pontiac offers an unimpressive 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, 6 year, 100,000 mile Corrosion warranty, and a roadside assistance plan.
