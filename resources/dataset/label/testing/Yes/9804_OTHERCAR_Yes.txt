            You may find it unusual to see a twenty-something couple in a Town Car, but we feel right at home.We needed a good highway cruiser for our trips to visit my wife's family in Kentucky. From our home in New Jersey, it's a 950 mile trip one way.We bought our Town Car used with 47,000 miles on it. It's a Cartier model with all the toys. We got about 24mpg on the open road. WE love the quiet ride, all the room, and the way it makes you feel good about yourself just pulling up next to lesser cars. It's got good power for passing and hills and will cruise all day at 80 mph. There are a few problems though. The engine likes to eat oil. There's no visible smoke and it passes the strict NJ smog test. I managed to drop oil consumption down to about 1qt. between changes by using Castrol syntec 5w50. Now the rear air suspension is leaking and I don't want to bother with that job. So, it's time for something new. WE put 45000 miles on it since we bought it so I think we got our money's worth. All in all a nice car that I will miss when it moves on to it's new owner.<br><br>
