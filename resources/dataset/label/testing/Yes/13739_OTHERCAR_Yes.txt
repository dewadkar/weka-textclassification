            I bought my 96 Subaru Impreza new. I bought it with the need for a reliable and economical vehicle to get me to and from work. It has done everything I have needed it to do. I have not had to take it to the shop for anything except a touch up paint job due to a malicious individual who decided to key it. Since it is a two door I have found it to be a little small for a family car but for singles or small families it does provide reliable transportation. If you are looking for luxury I wouldn't recommend it but it does run smoothly and quietly for a economical compact. If I were to have the decision to make over I probably would have spent the little extra to get a 4-door because I bought it without the knowledge that I was going to have a wife and son in the near future but I am truly pleased with how it drives. It makes tight turns well and is very user friendly. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a dependable vehicle that looks pretty decent and isn't picky about the small little perks. I don't recommend it to anyone who wants a car that drive like a Mercedes.<br><br>
