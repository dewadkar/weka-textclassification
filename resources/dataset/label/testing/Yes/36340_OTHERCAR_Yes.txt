            I got my 1993 Isuzu Rodeo LE for graduation from college in May 1995. It was bought 2 years used with roughly 42,000 miles. This was my first truck/SUV and 4WD vehicle. I had always wanted one since high school and finally got one.

When purchased it had original everything. The only thing I replaced was a CD player I already had in my previous vehicle. I did replace all four tires at about 60,000 miles.

<b>EXPERIENCE</b>
I loved this vehicle! It had enough room inside to hold the world. It would go anywhere with the knobby 17&quot; tires and 4WD. The ride was better than a pickup or other larger trucks, but not as smooth as a car. This is probably due to the knobby tires. The 4WD feature came in handy in a freak snowstorm in Nashville one Christmas. I was one of the only vehicles on the road. Also the Winter Take-Off mode slowed the torque so as not to spin out as much from take-offs in snow and ice.

I added a tow hitch when moving out of state one time. I had it put on at a U-Haul store, they had the appropriate hitch in stock. Limits on towing were 5,000 pounds. Towing was not a problem as my Rodeo weighed enough not to get whipped around by a 6x12' U-Haul trailer.

I did get a chance to compare my 1993 automatic to a manual version of a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo. The manual was louder, and felt stiffer to drive especially when cornering.

<b>PROBLEMS</b>
I experienced several problems with my Rodeo. Although I loved it, they were significant problems.

Within one year of purchasing my Rodeo, I had a problem with an oil leak under the engine block (It went through one whole bottle of oil in less than two days). It was a part that was past the warranty limits, and not under recall. The problem was a hole (manufactured) in the rear of the engine block, next to the firewall, blew its factory seal. The Isuzu shop I took it too said this was never supposed to happen, and they had never seen this issue before. Initially they said they would have to pull the engine to replug and reseal the hole. And even after doing so, now that the original seal was broken that it may happen again. In the end they did not have to pull the engine and the repairs only cost less than $300 instead of the estimated $800-$1000.

Later (1997) I took my Rodeo in to have the brakes checked. They had been making a progressively louder squeal when stopping, not just traffic braking. They were pretty worn and the mechanic stated that the brake pads were paper thin and the squeal was metal on metal. They would need to be replaced very soon (90,000 miles). 

I also had them check for an oil leak as I was witnessing smoke trailing me while driving freeway speeds (after reaching 86,000+ miles). It was not the same seal, I made sure they checked that. This time it was much more serious. They said it would result in some major engine work and definitely pulling the engine to fix it (estimated over $4,000).

The final problem I had was that in the next few days after that visit to the shop, I was on a trip in Tulsa, OK and my rodeo was stolen and totaled (almost 93,000 miles). Insurance did pay resale of $15,500 (1997) which financed my next truck. 

Overall, I loved my Rodeo. I would recommend one to anyone needing the extras for terrain and snow, or the ability to haul things. The capacity of this rodeo was enormous as I hauled and moved large objects for people several times. I do recommend you check it out for recalls and other seemingly standard repairs before making a buying decision.<br><br>
