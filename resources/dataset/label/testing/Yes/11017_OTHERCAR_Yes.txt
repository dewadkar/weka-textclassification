            I live in my Chevy Astro.  My hubby tells me I am on the road all the time - and to be honest, I am there a lot.  I am a stay - at - home  mommie of 4.  I am always taking the kids to some school, extracurricular, or social function.  I go shopping all the time.  Even if I don't buy, I go look.  So, I am in the van at least 5 of the 7 days of the week.  I have had very little problem with my Astro.  And, the problems I have had are mostly normal wear - rusted tailpipe, gas lever broke, and little things.  Only one thing has happened that I can say is not normal - the air conditioner sucked up a plastic Wal - Mart bag.  It got wrapped up in there, and to this date, is still there.  My van has also withstood a severe hail storm (I'm talking golf ball size hail.)  I would recommend this van to others.  I think it's only downfall is the lack of room in the back to hold some of my shopping bags.  Very little room there.<br><br>
