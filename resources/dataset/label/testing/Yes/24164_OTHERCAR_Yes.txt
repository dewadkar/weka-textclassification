            I own a Z28 convertible, and I am extremely happy with my purchase. It is the &quot;Best bang for the buck&quot;. You get incredible performance and reliability at a very affordable price. I was looking for a vehicle that could get me performance close to that of a Corvette, but still have four seats, and that I could easily afford. Well, there is no way that you could ever even consider a Mustang. Even the Mustang Cobra can't compete with a Z28. The Camaro has more power, better styling, and is more affordable. Since the beginning of the Camaro vs Mustang game, the Camaro has always won the competition. 
Some of the things that I really love about the Camaro, is the fact that it is amazingly powerful straight from the factory, it's easily and inexpensively modified, and it is powered by a GM powerplant, which means it is very reliable. I look forward to driving mine every day! I wake up thinking how great it is going to be, to get in the car and start it up, and listen to the rumble of the exhaust, then go out and out-perform any car that crosses my path. I used to have a Corvette, but then I got married, had children, and needed four seats. This car is still my hotrod, my daily driver, and my grocery getter. It still has enough room inside that I can put $200 worth of groceries. My insurance is also only $90 per month, for full coverage... and I am only 27.
If you want high performance at a reasonable price, then like I said before, the Camaro has the Best Bang for the Buck!!! If you own a Mustang, don't waste my time, and your gas! You can't beat me!!!<br><br>
