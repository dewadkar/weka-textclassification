            When first looking at cars, my wife and I decided on a small SUV so we could have room for our dogs and for cargo.  We looked at Honda's CRV, Toyota's Rav-4, and the Forester.  All were similarly priced when equipped like we wanted.  Each had their own good points, and none would be a bad choice.  But we decided on the Forester because of the better power, cargo room and towing capacity with about the same gas mileage as the rest.  Plus, the wife thought it was "cuter" than the rest.  We are pleased with our choice.

There is enough room in back for our two 60 pound dogs, with a rubber mat that keeps the back from getting too dirty.  The back seats are still available for people or cargo.   The seats fold down and make quite a bit of room.  I can sleep comfortable back there and I'm 6'1".  We used it to move our apartment.  The roof rack, trailer, and inside cargo room was enough to do it in only 4 trips.

The power is good.  We pulled a fully loaded 8' closed trailer 1000 miles with no problem.  We had plenty of acceleration and speed.  We also have a 14' boat that is easily pulled.  Freeway entrances are a breeze with the acceleration.  

The All Wheel Drive is great.  For fun the other week I was driving around the 3 foot snow drifts in the parking lot.  It never got stuck.  It goes through mud that my car easily gets stuck in.  On ice the tires will spin, so it does not make you invincible.

Subarus come loaded, with anti-lock brakes, air, cassette, air bags, cruise, and the stuff that most people have added on other cars.  The initial price is shocking until you see all the standard features.  But compare with other SUV's with those options, and the Subaru is a good deal.  Check out KBB at http://www.kbb.com/kb/ki.dll/kw.kc.nc2?kbb.MN;728449&56345;suv&167&M35M8& for a price.  We got the 5 speed manual, which shifts fine.

I did get into a big argument over the phone with the dealer.  He tried to offer me a deal by giving me MSRP.  Ha ha.  I told him what I would pay, and he asked where I got my numbers.  I said Kelly Blue Book.  He said KBB was wrong.  I had to explain that I am not an idiot.  Anyway, after all the yelling, I got a good deal, 2.5% over invoice.  Go 

The ride is quiet, smooth, and comfortable.  It is as much luxury as I would ever want.  It is big enough to get respect on the road, but small enough to drive easily.  My wife and I both like it very much.
