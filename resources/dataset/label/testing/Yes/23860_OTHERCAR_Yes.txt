            I bought my mini-van because between my husband and I we already had 4 children, and then I became pregnant with our daughter.  Well naturally not just any family car could hold 5 kids and 2 adults!  So I started looking for a mini-van.  When I bought my van we had to get a used one.  I found my 1990 Dodge Caravan.  This was the best mini-van I found by far.  It has over 138,000 miles on it and it still &quot;purrs&quot; like a kitten!!! The only things we have ever had to do to it was new tires (of course), and a new radiator.  I have owned my van for 2 years now!  There is no way I would trade it for any other van.  We are going to be buying a new van in the next year or two.  And I know that it will last much longer after that.  The thing that I love the best is the room that we have. We are able to go grocery shopping with all the children and still have plenty of room in the back for groceries.  I highly recomend that if you are buying a mini-van, that you look real closely at the Dodge mini-van's.  I hope I have helped you in making your decision on a vehicle purchase.<br><br>
