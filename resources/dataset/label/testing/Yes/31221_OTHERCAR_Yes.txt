            A few months ago my 73 year old cousin traded in his top of the line Cherokee for a Jeep Liberty.  When we visited him at his condo in Boca Raton a few months ago, I commented to my wife to look at that piece of sheet of a car in his parking lot, not knowing that was my cousin's new car.  After visiting with my cousin for awhile, we decided to drive by the beach and then have dinner.  Were we shocked when my cousin stopped by this abortion and proudly exclaimed that this Jeep Liberty Limited Edition was his new car.  He told me to pull on the latch to open the rear gate and put our beach gear in the back.  The window flipped up and nearly got me on the chin.  I was so startled at almost getting whacked by this window, I told my cousin that this was the ugliest car he had ever owned.

Four of us got into the car.  Surprisingly, it was very roomy with plenty of headroom and legroom in the front.  The back seat was sufficient, but it was a little tight getting out of the car.  The leather interior was very comfortable.  The ivory colored instrument gauges were easy to read.  I was very impressed with the brushed chrome trim inside.

Yesterday, with the South Florida weather in the 60's, I drove with my cousin from Miami to Key West in his Jeep Liberty.  I asked him if I could drive the 3 hours down to the Keys.  I put this car through all kinds of tests, driving at times almost 80mph on the Florida Turnpike, making all kinds of turns, sudden braking, etc.    In my opinion, the Liberty held the road as well as most other sport utility vehicles.

The window controls are on the center console instead of the door.  I must have hit the door locks by accident every time I wanted to lower or raise the window.  This is not a major problem in South Florida because the temperatures are rarely this cool.  The windows are always shut and the air conditioner stays on almost twelve months a year.

If you are a Jeep follower, the Liberty's front has the seven-slot grille and round headlamps that are the trademark of a jeep.  My cousin paid about $25,000 for this fully loaded vehicle.  This tough little car is not only for kids.  My 73 year old cousin is proof of this.  The Liberty can probably last about 73 years.
