            We own a 1994 Chevy Sub.  We live in a rural community and do a lot of road travel. It has proven to be great! We have never had any unusual problems with it and it has over 90,000 miles!  It holds 6 very comfortable for long trips and we always have plenty of luggage space. We added a tv/vcr combo which mounts on the console between the front seats and everyone in the back to seats can enjoy a movie! I do think it could use some cup holders for those sitting in the middle seat. I find the panel easy to read and all components are easy to operate. The dual air works very well in our hot and humid climate. We do have some problems with parking in the city because so many spaces are designed for small cars. Overall, I would recommend a Sub. for anyone! <br><br>
