            I bought this car because I heard it was a great family vehicle.  It is a 4 door and great if you have little children.  I have a 10 month old son and it fits our needs for a family car.  I even have the option of putting my son in the front seat if I want because there I got one without an airbag on the passenger side.  
This car also handles very good.  When I go over a speed bump in an apartment complex, the vehicle rides awesome.  You can't tell you have gone over a speed bump.  
I have had little or no problems with this car.  I do the basic maintenance as it is suggested, oil changes, tires rotations, etc.  This vehicle suits my needs with my son.  
When I am in my car, I never worry about if it is safe for my son to be in.  I feel completely at ease and completely comfortable when I am in my 1996 Buick Regal.  
Another great feature is the dual climate control.  This is great when my son is in the front seat.  I tend to get hot easily but my son does not.  I can set the dual control to where both of us are comfortable.
Any person with a family should buy this car.  It is a great car.  My next car purchase will be a Buick because it is dependable and I like them very much now.<br><br>
