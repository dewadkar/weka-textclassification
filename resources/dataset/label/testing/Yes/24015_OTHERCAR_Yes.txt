            This car is my moms "grocery getter" i've used it on and off for a couple of years...so i know all about this car.  The first thing i would like to say is that this car is super quiet anywhere.  The ride is ultra smooth, and the suspension is firm, but supple enough for a good ride. The seats are very comfortable, and the engine has a sound that only 4 overhead camshafts can make, while churning at 8000rpm's.  Once you get the engine up over 4600rpms, you can really feel some power, and the car moves really well. The 4 speed automatic is good for what it is...although a 5speed manual or automatic would be a little nicer.  Its fast enough to out-drag most other kids cars at my school, except some 454's, mustangs, or Got Rice racers...which are pretty cool too.  Anyways, i would reccommend this car to anyone, especially someone in need of a great family car...or a potential street racer, remember this engine is the same one found in the Supra in the FAST and the FURIOUS, which puts out 650hp, and is a 10second car. Just to give you something to think about.  These 1993-96 i believe have the NAKAMICHI soundsystem as an option, it is an awesome system 280watt, and even includes a 10inch subwoofer on the rear deck...awesome sound!!!  Exceptional quality!!
