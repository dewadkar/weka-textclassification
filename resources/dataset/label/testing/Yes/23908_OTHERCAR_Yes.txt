            In other words, the TT is to Audi what the Viper is to Dodge and the New Beetle is to Volkswagen: a halo car whose glow radiates across the whole model line. The fact that it is stunning to look at and a blast to drive is confounded by its price: $30,500 base, and $33,925 loaded. There's only one drawback: Audi plans to have only 4,000 or so available in the U.S. this year and 10,000 next year (out of a worldwide production of 50,000). It is produced in Audi's new plant in Gyor, Hungary. Getting your hands on one is likely to require the patience of Job. The TT gets its name from the Tourist Trophy, motoring's oldest race. A 180-horsepower, 1.8-liter turbocharged, 4-cylinder engine with five valves per cylinder drives the front wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. The 2+2 configuration means the tiny back seat is just big enough for your briefcase or knapsack. An all-wheel-drive Quattro version will be offered later this year, followed at some point next year by a 225-horsepower roadster version. I sampled TT's visual impact and traffic-stopping looks first-hand while driving early production models during a recent media preview. As my co-pilot and I sat at a traffic light, a young woman in a Camaro convertible interrupted her cell phone conversation to shower praise on our car and inquire abouts its origin.
