            ORIGINAL BODY FROM 9/2000 REVIEW: I bought my 2000 Kia Sportage in order to escape an especially bad loan on a 1994 Geo Tracker 2WD softtop.  The difference between the two vehicles is akin to night and day.  The Kia is sturdy, rigid, well-appointed, very quiet on the inside, appealing to the eye, practical and fun to drive. 
Consumer Reports and some other automobile testing publications are down on this vehicle, but when you read their opinions and those about similar Japanese and European vehicles, it is very interesting to see that where Kia gets minus points, the others earn praise!  
Take, for example, the Kia's tire gate on the rear of the vehicle.  Consumer Reports calls it "awkward" and says it is a bother and gives it a demerit for this feature.  Yet on the Honda Passport, a/k/a Isuzu Rodeo, this feature is praised as "sturdy" and practical. Bias against Kia and Korean manufacturers? Most likely, just like Consumer Reports and others first hated Toyota and all the Japanese imports many years ago.  Another point in case: Kia's 4WD is "part time" or "on demand," which two years ago, Consumer Reports called "better than wasteful full-time all-wheel drive."  Now, in their review of the Sportage, Consumer reports gives Kia a demerit for not having "full-time" AWD. I say, "Beans!" - I like having 4WD on demand so that it is there when I need it and helps rather than lulling me into a false sense of security when it is on all the time.
Another reviewer says Kia's interiors are "cheap." Where? Has that reviewer ever driven a Geo? A Honda Civic? The Kia's interior is plush, well designed, well-appointed, and comfortable. "Extras" such as electric mirrors, windows, door locks, cassette stereo with 6 speakers, alarm system, etc. came standard on mine.  Other thoughtful extras abound, too, such as a lumbar support in the driver's seat, adjustable seat-belt tensioners, a cup-holder in front designed not to interfere with shifting (as it does on a friend's much more expensive Subaru Outback LTD!), and many other nice touches such as a knee-airbag, side-impact beams in the passenger doors, various little "idiot lights" one has to buy as part of a "package" with other makers.
My only quibble with this vehicle to date has been the placement of a little button that allows adjustment of the front armrest...when you strap on your seatbelt, this button gets punched every time you round a corner, causing the armrest to adjust itself forward, which drives me nuts...but considering that the armrest is free and works well and that I can shed a few more pounds anyway, I can live with that...
Last but not least, the dealer experience I had was phenomenal! No B.S., no "what's it gonna take to put you in this car?", no games.  Polite professionalism abounded.  When I had bought the car, everyone in the dealership thanked me. On Monday morning, I got a surprise package at work with a pound of peanut brittle, a "Thank You" balloon and a card signed by everyone in the dealership too. Contrast that to when I bought my 1989 Dodge Omni (Omni means "all" in Latin, and I did replace "all" of that car while I owned it, so it was aptly named at least), the dealer shook my hand and made a big deal out of the fact that he had filled the (10 gallon) tank for me. That was it...
In summary, this is a well-equipped car.  I, like many, am opting for 5 years of payments and, thanks to Hyundai/Kia's generous warranty program, I know that when I make my last payment, it won't be for something that either ceased functioning or is about to die, contrary to many vehicles (especially domestically-built) ones. Want a great 4x4 for under $20K with appealing style, rigidity, solid construction and a warranty with teeth?  Go, Kia, go!

UPDATE 7/7/01 - After nearly 1 year and 9000 miles, still TROUBLE FREE! Yes, there were a few rattles here and there, (mainly because I didn't secure the back seat properly after folding it down to transport some cargo in its capacious hold) and the gasket over the driver's door developed an annoying pinhole leak after long, heavy rains. But Kia fixed those two "boo-boos" promptly with NO ifs ands, or buts and, of course, at NO CHARGE - something I can look forward to for another 4.1 years (big smile!). 

There has been NO real trouble whatsoever and I remain a firm and convinced Kia backer and buyer - the Sportage 4x4 remains beyond reproach in ALL aspects. It does EXACTLY what Kia promises, and it even exceeds the estimated gas mileage handsomely (which may be, however, because I run premium in it - saves on tune-ups and engine wear). The car has required NOTHING beyond its regular maintenance, has developed NO shimmies, odd noises, or quirky behavior. The engine now is more elastic than when new (naturally), with further elasticity to develop as it loosens up with age. The BEST PART is that I still LIKE this vehicle a year later, both in terms of LOOKS (undated and crisp) and PERFORMANCE (exactly as expected and needed). While it is not a race car and is easily outrun by many others, I didn't buy it for that reason and didn't expect that kind of performance, either. (Had I been looking for a hot rod, I would have bought one. Go figure - me practical and logical, too?)

Compared to the Geo Tracker (what a go cart! - see old review body above) and a previous Dodge Omni (yikes! - see old review body above), this has been the most pleasant new-car experience I have had in the past 25 years, in which I bought a total of 6 new cars off dealer lots. 

By the way, notice how even Consumer Reports now is being nice to Kia's parent, Hyundai? Strange, isn't it? When Toyota first got here in the '60s, C.R. hated them, too. Same for Mazda, Isuzu and a bunch of other Japanese makers. Hyundai was despised by C.R. as "cheap and terrible" for years, although now C.R. finds them "well made and reliable" and has even bestowed "Best Buy" status on one or two models. Puzzled? Don't be - it's just the American way as signified so aptly by that cereal commercial years ago - hate everything new and get someone else to try it first (until something newer comes along to hate). With Kia and Sportage sales at all time highs, obviously there is more to this vehicle than just a low sticker. 

PET PEEVES after 1 year? Well, that armrest button is still annoying as all get out, but thinner drivers (I am now down to 235# at 6 feet) likely will wonder what I am on about in the first place. The 6-speaker cassette-stereo works well but lacks a bass/treble control ("tone" is all that is offered), but a retrofit (aftermarket) of a new unit with a CD player will take care of that easily and affordably. The folding-forward maneuver of the rear seat is a little more tedious and cumbersome than it could be, but since I have only needed the feature twice - big deal! (And after the scramble I was truly amazed at how much the Sportage holds with its full cargo area exposed. Phenomenal!) 

BOTTOM LINE, 1 year later - Unless you find your personal status reflected in the car you drive, this is a rugged vehicle worth considering. To boot, it disproves the "You get what you pay for" adage - with the Sportage, I got a whole lot more than I paid for (see review body above for details).

FACIT: If you are a car snob, this Bud's not for you. If you want solid, reliable transportation with lots of creature comfort at no extra cost, this is your Bud, bud!

UPDATE 3/30/02: After 19,500 miles, a grueling trip to Florida and back from Washington D.C. (grueling due to nonstop hi-speed driving, both ways), and a lot of wear, tear and abuse, I am happy to report that Miss Kia is holding up better than expected. Defects that have developed and been repaired in the entire period from purchase to today are: 

1.  Rear right seatbelt extended fully and stayed that way one evening when friends were riding with me to a local movie theater. Criswell Kia in Gaithersburg, MD, the original dealer for this vehicle, fixed this without incident or cost under the terrific warranty.

2.  I noticed and passengers complained about significant wind noise at both front doors at higher speeds. Again, Criswell fixed this with no difficulties.

3.  The "Check Engine" light mysteriously came on at about 17K miles, stayed on for two days and then went off when I ran the car through a wash rack. Criswell determined that a sensor in the main circuit board was bad and replaced the entire unit, which also fixed #4, below.

4.  While the system worked perfectly when new, after about 14 months, the alarm system would only activate intermittently. The faulty circuit mentioned above was replaced and all is well again.

Not bad, I think, considering that previously-owned American-made vehicles had all racked up much more serious defects and problems and were usually not repaired entirely free of charge, even with a warranty in force (e.g. Dodge, notorious warranty-weasels!). My dealer, Criswell, is highly recommended, gracious, clean and very meticulous. 

BOTTOM LINE AFTER 18 MOS.: Still love this car, still strong in every way. Too bad other people in parking lots keep nicking and denting my poor baby, but the touchup paint I bought has taken care of most of the "boo boos" so I am not too unhappy about this. Just wish people would respect other people's property more...
