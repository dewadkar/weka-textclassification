            The 2000 Dodge Ram 1500 series has a lot to offer.  You get a sporty looking truck with the power to do just about anything.  I have yet to find something that I cannot tow, or pull with a Dodge Truck.  The 1500 series comes with 3 different engines to choose from, there is the 3.9L 
V-6 which is good for the local contractor for a work truck.  There is the 5.2L V-8 which has a lot of horsepower and pep.  Then there is the 5.9L V-8 which is the biggest gasoline engine offered in the 1500.  The Dodge Ram has good points, but as with anything else it has bad ones.  There is plenty of towing power with the Ram, but there are also alot of blind spots in the Ram.  My experience's with this particular vehicle has been very good, and I would recommend a 1500 for anyone with the need for power and a good looking truck.<br><br>
