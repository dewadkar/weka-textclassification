            Creature Comforts
&gt;The ride is great considering the vehicle has is equipped with the towing package. 
&gt;Still no major rattles, squeaks or issues and the doors still close with a solid thud!
&gt;Nice extra feature on the sound system that raises the volume as your speed increases, this is helpful since the outside highway noise tends to be a little higher than sedans.
&gt;Very comfortable seats, driver side lumbar support is really enjoyed for long trips, 6 way power too. 
&gt;If one little feature stands out it has to be the extra sun visor and visor extension...How many times have you pushed your visor to the side to block the sun and the sun is always right between the edge of the door and the end of the visor. You don't have that problem with the Jimmy, the visor has a 6 inch extension that covers that area, you also get a &quot;mini&quot; visor so you don't have to keep moving the main one back and forth when your direction changes.
&gt;The fan dial on the climate controls is not very ergonomic, though I know that this is changed in 1998 and up models. 
&gt;The free road side assistance is a nice plus too.
&gt;The only other complaint is the area where the lights &amp; rear wiper switches are located on the dash has no back lighting, which make it a little difficult to find without turning on the overhead lighting. 

Performance
&gt;No issues here, the only maintenance has been new front brakes and a battery changed(battery covered by warranty).

Overall the Jimmy is an excellent purchase, I recommend it to anyone.
