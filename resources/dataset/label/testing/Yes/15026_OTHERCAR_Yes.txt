            Well, after researching my options for digital Ebay photos, I kept coming across SONY Mavica SD-73 among Ebay sellers. I looked into it, and had a few days there that I was bouncing back and forth between cameras with higher resolution and the Mavica SD-73.

I can tell you honestly, after owning this fun camera only 1 month, I'm extremely pleased I went with the disc photo option vs. plugging into computer and downloading photos. I have been to 2 parties with this camera, taken photos, edited out bad ones, copied to disc (instantly)... and gave out the discs to the party-goers before leaving the party! People are so intrigued with that feature, and for me, it's my favorite thing about the Mavica.

I'm not going to claim this is a print quality camera - no, not at all. If that's what you're looking for, obviously go with a higher resolution digital and one that you hook up to your computer to download photos. But the ease of operation on the Mavica is fantastic!

Posting on Ebay has never been easier, point, shoot, pop in disc, post the auction! I have had some amazing clarity on my web photos used for my auctions.<br><br>
