            I turned 16 last October, and since then I have been sharing cars with my sister. Either that or wait till the next available car. Well now all that is going to change. I just got a brand new 1999 Acura Integra GS-R. This amazing set of wheels does not only come with leather, CD player, and power windows...It is packed with 170 horsepower, coming from a high performance DOHC VTEC-equipped GS-R engine. This system is like two engines in one: a smooth, responsive power plant at standard engine speeds and a powerful, eager engine at higher speeds. Let me tell you this baby can fly! I would like to tell you more, but I would rather be driving this baby, than writing about it. If you are thinking of buying the GS-R...do not worry, you will be greatly rewarded! Through out the time in which I will be owning the Integra...I plan on playing the role of Dr. Frankenstein. I will be adding many enhancements. First off, I want to add a band new stereo system to replace the factory installed one. I am thinking of an Alpine headunit, Infinity Kappa speakers, 2 10' JL W3's, and a 6 channel amp. Hopefully, within the next month or two, I will be driving down the streets of my home town Tampa Bay...with a little extra BOOM! Apart from the new stereo system and considering I do not have a bunch of spare change, I was thinking of getting some new rims. Do not get me wrong, the factory rims on the GS-R are pretty damn nice. But it was just a thought. Also I might get some fog lights to make the car look nice at night. Other than that...the car will be the same as when I bought it. This car also appeals to the ladies.  I have gotten many compliments from passer-by's ranging from little kids to the elderly!
