            Ever since I learned to drive, I only wanted the best car for my own. Of coarse my first car wasn't that but my second was the smartest buy I've ever made. It was of coarse the 1992 Nissan Maxima. I bought it used and I've had for about two years now and I have never had a problem with it. And let's just say I'm not always on time with the tune-ups and oil changes. So that tells you something about this car right there. It's very reliable. I honestly couldn't tell you accurately how many miles we and the previous owner put on this little dream car but it is pretty high and it is still in great condition! The engine sounds like new and there's never been any work done on it at all. So for those of you that need a good car that won't let you down, this would be the car for you!<br><br>
