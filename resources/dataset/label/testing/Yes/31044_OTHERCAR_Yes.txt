            When I went looking for a new car i had many options.  I first decided upon a luxury car.  So I looked at the the Lexus's and the Mercedes and i was suprized to find myself choosing and Infinity.  I bought and Infinity I30t (touring edition).  The car is what I consider a perfect buy for the price tag.

The exterior is very similar to many lexus's and mercedes.  The touring editions features a spoiler one the rear bumber, its not to high.  The car i selected was black with black interior.  The car has has a nice shinny grill upfront.  

The interior is nice with a wood looking dash board.  The glove department is fairly large enough to hold your esential road stuff.  There is seating for 5 comfortably.  There is plenty of leg room in the back for even bigger people.  

The car handles very well and has the feel of a quick sports car.  So, if your going from a sports car there will be no loss of speed here.  

The t in the name means touring edition.  That means the car has a spoiler, which is on the back bumper.  And, there is heated seats in the car.  The car has a cd play and tape player with Bose speakers.  They are really nice so no need for an improved sound system here.

Overall i recommend this car to people intereted in sports cars or in luxury cars.  So, give it a shot!!!<br><br>
