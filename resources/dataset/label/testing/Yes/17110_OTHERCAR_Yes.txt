            I've had mine for 3 months now - and I just love it!  It's just the right size, it's easy to park and handles really well.  The sun roof is very nice.  I like the way you can open it or vent it.  Very comfortable seats.  The cruise control is very smooth.  I also like the many ways you can adjust the seats.  Visibility is great. The headrest in the center of the backseat blocks it a little, but it is removable.  The quality of the vehicle is apparent - it is a very solid vehicle, but not at all clunky.
  So far the only warranty work it's needed was the electric door locks went up and down several times when I locked it with the remote clicker.
I don't like the location and size of the drink holders.  They are not very deep, and are limited in the size of the container it can hold.  The front ones are directly in front of a vent, so the air blows directly on what is in the drink holder.<br><br>
