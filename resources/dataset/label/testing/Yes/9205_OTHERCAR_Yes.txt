            I purchased this vehicle for its all-weather handling capabilities.  So far, it has performed without a hitch on slippery surfaces and is a pleasure to drive. 

Some pros:

Decent gas mileage, much better than the SUV's.  I get about 23-24mpg in the city and upwards to 28-29 on the freeway.  I tend to get the higher mileage using the premium gasoline (Subaru recommends 91 octane or higher).  It drives just like a car on the freeway, and did not slip on gravel or dirt roads with moderate inclines.  The 2.5L engine also gave good acceleration, I can reach 60mph in about 10 seconds.  A little bonus, I discovered the 2.5l engine model doesn't need to have the timing belt replaced until 105,000 miles instead of 60,000 with the 2.2l engine.

Some minor cons:

The built-in stereo sounds rather poor. The cup-holder blocks the temperature controls. The automatic transmission doesn't &quot;click&quot; into place very well - there have been a few times I thought I was in reverse, but it was in neutral.  If you are really going to be driving off the road, you would be better off with a 4wd that has higher clearance and a suspension more suited to the task.

One other minor con I recently discovered (when being a passenger on a long trip) is that the passenger/driver seats are not very comfortable for lying down and sleeping in!  I'm not sure what it is, but the headrest just doesn't seem to be in the right place when trying to lie down.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that needs a roomy vehicle that is good for the family as well as capable of handling in adverse conditions while getting decent gas mileage.   If you are going to buy a used Outback, I also recommend getting at least a 1996 or newer model, as the 1995 model is basically the same as the normal Legacy wagon, while the 1996 has a raised suspension and other innards that are completely different from the 1995 model.
