            While I do not personally own one of these cars, my friend just got one, and I have driven it several times (he's a good friend).  When I first saw it, I thought it was an Accord and that he was pulling my leg, until I read the Toyota name.  I personally am a big fan of Toyota, as my mom has an Avalon and we have had many Camry's.  I still own a Camry with over 150,000 miles on it and it runs find.

So I was not surprised when this Solara ran great.  The interior was loaded, yet the price was right.  Personally, I think the power is a little better than the Accord, though the ride is not as quiet.  I would recommend that anyone who finds the Accord they want try the Solara before buying, as you may be very surprised.  

Gas mileage, as in all of my Toyotas, is great.  The car steers perfectly and it is sleek and stylish.  I do not know what is standard on these models, but I know what my friend paid for his, and he has an incredible sound system for the price.  The interior is a blend of vinyl and leather.  I am not extremely impressed with the seats, but the wooden dash adds a great touch.  

The comfort level of this car is great.  I would say that the back seat offers more room than the Accord, but I am not positive in this regard. I would definitely rather the back seat of this car than many other 2-doors, as the back seat is roomy, and it is EASY to get into (no contortionist climbing).

One negative thing I will say about Toyota in general is that the resale value is not the greatest.  An Accord and a Solara may be extremely similar, but the price tag does not reflect that when the car is three or four years old, as an Accord will fetch much more (or that is the case with most of Honda's similar models).  If I were deciding between the two I would go more by looks than anything else.  Which car do you think looks better?  Which dealer will give you the best deal and the best extras?  When it all comes down to it, these are the two main questions because as far as everything else goes, the Solara and the Accord are both great cars! <br><br>
