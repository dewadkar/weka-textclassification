            I run a small computer business and am now on my second Ford Ranger Pickup Truck.  I lease the vehicle and chose it primarily based on price, gas mileage and reliability.  I couldn't be happier.

Both Rangers I have leased, a 1997 and now 1999 model, have similar features.  Both came with a CD-Player and the sound is really rather remarkable for such a moderately priced truck.  I also purchased the stick shift rather than the optional automatic.  I did have a son-in-law who owned the automatic version, and would not recommend that unless you purchase the more expensive 6 cylinder model.

I can't say that I actually hate anything about the truck.  The back tailgate on the new 99 isn't as solid and doesn't close as nicely as the one did on the 1997.  However, that appears to be more of a manufacturing defect rather than a design defect.  On the positive side, at 6 feet 2 inches I was a bit cramped in the 1997.  The 1998 has increased the legroom and as a result, I am very comfortable with the amount of leg room.  One other nice addition to the newer model is a couple of plastic trays behind the seats to hold those things that we worker vehicle users inevitably stuff back there.  

As to driving, the Ranger is a very nice riding small truck.  I have friends who have S-10's and other small pickups and none seem to ride as nicely or as comfortably as the Ranger.  Like all pickups, the rear end is very light and thus in the winter I put a couple of bags of calcium chloride in the back.  This stabilizes the rear end and makes it go through the snow as well as any light weight rear wheel drive automobile.

Purchasers should be looking for a utility truck that is intended for light hauling and around town type travel.  Both the trucks I've owned haven't missed a day of service to my business in over three years.  <br><br>
