            I've driven 240 estates (sorry wagons!) for 10 years now. I originally bought one to protect my family and it certainly proved it could do that! Unfortunately my wife had an crash in our car where she hit a Vauxhall Corsa (small compact and not all her fault!) The Corsa was wrecked, our car needed one new headlight and a new bumper - very impressive for those who care about their safety.
Regarding reliability, I service my cars myself and I have never had to do anything other than routine servicing. My present car is a 1993 model which I bought when it was one year old, it has now done 65000 miles, so it's not really run in yet!
Brilliant cars which do everything asked of them, totally reliable and safe, I really couldn't see myself driving anything else.

p.s. my car is totally galvanised so I intend to keep it forever!!    <br><br>
