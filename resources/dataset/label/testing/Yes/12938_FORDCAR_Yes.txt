            I know that Ford Windstar is not the first on the list of minivans. But 2 reasons made me lease this minivan. 1) It was the cheapest price (ford = afford) I found w/ all options (Cassette/CD, Power driver seat, fog lamps, Anti-Theft Alarm, Side airbags, Traction control, Rear A/C, Adjustable pedals, Self-sealing tires ++), and I also got a $2,500 Rebate, And 2) as my credit is not the top, and only Ford's "Red Carpet Lease" Approved me without a co-signer. So the next 3 years I'll go with Ford, Although it's not the favorite.

But now, after 3 weeks, I see I didn't make that big mistake. In fact, I love this car, replacing my old ugly '92 Ford Aerostar which gave me nothing but problems, bad ride, bad brakes and no features at all, I'm glad I took the Windstar. The Ride is very comfortable, and quiet too unless you depress the gas hard it's very noisy. Although the ride is not as smooth as Chrysler's T&C I tested, It's not far behind. Brakes are excellent. The power seat is very comfortable, and I have an excellent view of the road ahead, All controls are very logically placed, more than any other minivan I've seen before. For example, the rear wiper control is on the same lever as the front wipers, and the controls for the Audio system is also very good. Except for the Climate Controls I think the Chevy Venture & Oldsmobile Silhouette is smarter. Fuel economy is the worst of all minivans (except for the new Kia Sedona). But the Windstar have the biggest fuel tank in class (26 gallon), so you could manage to drive about 530 miles before refueling, while most other minivans offers just about 20 gallon (except for the GM minivans).

Before I even shopped for prices I did a research of all minivans, all features and what you get for your money, Believe it or not, the Ford Windstar was on the top of my list. I also love the design, even I know most of you think it's boring... I love the exterior, the doors, door handles, liftgate, and very much the taillamps, and as well the interior, the seats are very comfortable (but Chrysler T&C is better), The gauges are beautiful, big clear bright numbers, and striking red pointers, The audio system has very good features (although not the "Auto Volume" offered in GM's vehicles, which is a part of Bose' Audio system technology). One thing I do not like about most new cars, that when using a cassette and using rew/ff buttons, the radio comes on automatically, it makes me sometimes crazy. At-least they should offer it as an option).

I took the LX deluxe which has most features of the next trim level, the SE, But no bucket seats, no Illuminated sun visors, No heated mirrors, which is the only really thing bothers me, especially since the GM & Chrysler offers it standard on all models minivans. In my opinion I like the center bench seat more than the bucket, so access to the rear seat is much easier, and also you have more room, for an additional suitcase at the sliding door, for instance.

Rear cargo room is not as much as Chryslers T&C, but it's almost the same, and should be enough for most people, and in addition, it's very easy to move the seat forward, (it slides on tracks as far as possible to the next seat) and you get very much space!

The rear cup holders is not designed to be comfortable for the rear passengers. Chrysler, Toyota & Honda have designed much more comfortable accessories, cupholders & bins at a more comfortable position for the rear passengers. Still, the rear seat of the Windstar is quite comfortable.

--------------------------

Now, after driving it almost 8 months, I must repeat that it's really good. I just love my Windstar! The ride is great, and I'm so comfortable in the car I can travel with for hours, if not for days. I'm not that big expert to understand all the hard-meaning words, "unrefined", "cheap fit & finish", and some other words used by the big experts. I have the power I need, the A/C is ice cold front & rear, and the steam in winter is fire-hot, and warms up very quickly. The front center console is very useful & smart designed, as well as the overhead console. All controls are really good, view outside is stunning on all sides, except for the big blind spot at the outside mirrors.

I recently tested a few other minivans, the Toyota Sienna between them, and except the quiet ride, I don't see what's better than the Windstar (ha ha, funny?) For me the Windstar is just good, handles good and gives me all my needs (almost). I have almost 8,000 miles on it, no single time went for repairs. Everything is in best working order. My friend bought a brand new 2002 Sienna, and 2-3 things is not working at all, including the High-beams! Believe it or not!

The Windstar offers a lot specialties others don't offer. For example, Windstar (and most other Ford vehicles) have the best Power Door locks/Power Windows controls, it's big and clearly illuminated (The Toyota's are not illuminated, and you cannot find the controls while in the dark). Most Ford's also offer a keypad numeric unlock feature, so you never get locked out! And of course you can get in anytime without a key or key fob! The rear liftgate glass of the Windstar is very big, giving you a good view out (especial while the rear seat is folded). The Toyota Sienna (and most other Toyota's) has a very small rear glass.

The Windstar offers in the higher-end models heated signal mirrors, which also flashes while the sliding doors are open. They also features 'cornering lamps', which illuminates you the way you're turning to. However, the Windstar does not offer fog lamps feature at this time. But I like the 2 lamps inside the car at the floor at the 2 sliding doors, which illuminates the floor for you. Also there is a 'baby sleeping mode', that if a baby (or even an adult) is sleeping and you want to open the door and the interior lamps shouldn't wake'em up, this feature is very useful, it turns off all the upper lamps, and just the lamps on the floor are working. If you try it once, you'll see how wonderful it is.

Another advantage from the Windstar over most other vehicles I discovered, that if you turn the engine off while the wipers are in the middle of wiping the windshield, the 'retained power' will bring it down, unlike most other cars if you turn the engine off, the wipers keep staying in the place they was before, I hope you got the point.

The higher-end Windstar also feature a 'message center', which besides the compass & outside temperature, tells you everything you need to know, not just 'door ajar' but exactly which door is open, if any bulb is burned-out, it tells you which one, rear right taillamp, left front signal, etc. It has a trip computer, lets you know how many miles you can still drive with the remaining fuel, average speed & mileage, it will also check all the fluids for you, and the oil life monitor will let you know when you need a new oil change. It can make you a system checkup, and let you know a lot of things. All in all it's a very useful feature.

Also on the higher models, is the 'reverse sensing system', which alerts you of any object in your way while in reverse. It have sensors in the rear which detects anything behind you.

With all this information, you must agree it's a wonderful vehicle!
