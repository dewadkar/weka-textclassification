            I spent the better part of a week reading reviews and going out to look at the cameras before buying the CD-400. I was also considering Sony's top-of-the-line 5.4 mega pixel camera but after reading another review on this site about storage and how convenient the built-in CD drive was, the decision became quite easy.

Photo Quality - I had the opportunity to examine 8x10 photos printed from this camera along side photos from the 5 mega pixel and could not tell the difference. 

Options - This camera has so many options for adjusting to light and specific shooting conditions. It has automatic landscape, portrait, night, and night portrait settings, as well as a multi-burst mode which gets around the 3 to 4 second delay between single shots. It has a built-in timer, a movie option that will record until the CD is full, and it also allows you to record audio with still photos.

Likes - Even at the highest resolution, you can still fit nearly 120 photos on a CD and if its a rewritable one you can copy them to a hard-drive and reuse it again. ( about 300 times). The recordable CD are so inexpensive though you are almost better off leaving the pictures on them instead of using up hard-drive space. 

This camera takes incredible photos and I have found that with the setting and options you hardly need to use the flash. Instead you can shoot with natural lighting and get a more realistic picture.I snapped some great shots on our ski trip, one in particular captured a snowball just inches before impact on my sons head. It made for a nice desktop background.

Dislikes - The delay between photos while you wait for it to finish accessing the disk can be annoying if you are trying to get another shot right away, but typically its not a problem. The viewing screen has no cover or hood and I found in bright sunlight, you can have a difficult time trying to see what you are shooting at. Also in burst mode, ones it snaps the first shot the viewing screen goes black so you can't see if you target is still in the frame for the sequence of photos.
