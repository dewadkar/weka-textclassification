            The floppy disks make this an easy to use digital camera.  The only downside I have found (and it is NOT a big one) is that the bulk of the camera makes it a bit awkward at first for those of us who are used to using small, point and shoot cameras.  However, once I shot a few disks, I got used to the size and absolutely LOVE THIS CAMERA!  It is great for taking pictures for email or the web, and the disks make it simple to share files with your local friends and family.  I have found the sharpness of the lens to be as good or better than other digital cameras in the same price range.  Two words for the Mavica:  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<br><br>
