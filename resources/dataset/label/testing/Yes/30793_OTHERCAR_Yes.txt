            I was preparing to sell things on the net and needed a computer and digital camera.  I am primitive, doing laundery in the yard like Ma Kettle. Each attempt to learn enough about digital camera left me back in my bunker crushing aluminun cans.  my Olympus 340R was purchased because of its very competetive price and more than usual features in this price range.  A reputable shop cautioned me about buying a discount camera.  I showed them what I was going to buy and asked that they critique my purchase against their cameras.  No camera offered more features or better resolution or a price that was closer than 100.00 more.  I put the camera away fearing its supremacy over me.  I don't handle defeat very well.  Ya know something...there came a point when I had to face down this camera.  No kidding in 5 minutes I was down loading  images into my computer.  The aspect of web work I feared the most has actually been the most enjoyable and this camera makes me look good.<br><br>
