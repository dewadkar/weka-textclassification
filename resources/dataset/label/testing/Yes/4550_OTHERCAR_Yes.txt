Some time ago k_so had reviewed the C-2040Zoom in an article titled "Too many little annoyances add up". I felt the review did quite a bit of injustice to the Olympus C-2040Zoom so I wrote this epinion to point out some of the inaccuracies in k_so's review. I never meant it as a personal affront or anything, but k_so subsequently deleted "Too many little annoyances add up". It was anyway meant for the C-2020 (the previous model) and I think it still available as an epinion for the Oly C-2020.

So now I have modified this epinion to essentially point out how the C-2040 irons out some of the flaws in the C-2020.

<B>IMPROVEMENT #1: 
- Lens cap must still be taken off manually but is now leashed</B>
In the C-2020 the lens cap was not attached to the camera, and was very easy to misplace. In the C-2040 there is actually this nifty little string that attaches the cap to the camera strap. No real risk of misplacing the lens cap on the C-2040. 
The camera does not come with an automatic lens cap (like the Canon S110) because it allows the user to add an adaptor and then filters/lenses etc. Which is quite a nice thing is you ever intend on trying some serious photography.
But if you forget to remove the lens cap and turn on the camera, there is still a lot of scary grinding. I have done that a few times now, but (hopefully) no damage has been done.

<B>IMPROVEMENT #2: 
- USB interface</B>
The C-2020 did not come with USB; the C-2040 has a USB port, and comes with the USB cable and appropriate drivers. Which makes tranferring pictures to your computer a quick and easy process. The transferring process is quite battery intensive though, and it makes sense to buy an external SM card reader or an AC adaptor for the camera.

<B>IMPROVEMENT #3:
- Faster lens</B>
Some pictures should come out much better if taken with the C-2040.

<B>FLAWS THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED: 
- Panorama view only works with Olympus (tm) brand media cards
- QuickTime movie function does not provide sound </B>
The manual clearly states these 2 limitations. One can still use the 8MB card that comes with the camera to do panoramic shots. Not having sound with the Quicktime pictures is irritating at times, but is not that big a deal.

<B>PROS OF THE C-20xx SERIES
- Battery life
- Good image quality </B>
Yup, the Olympus C-2040 takes great pics. Much better than the Canon S-110 and other comparable 2MP cameras. It has a faster lens, more zoom, and lots of manual controls. It is, however, much too large to carry around in your pocket or anything. 

I looked at several 2MP cameras when I went shopping - Canon S-110, Canon A20, Nikon Coolpix 775, Fujifilm Finepix 6800 and the Oly C-2040. I read a lot of reviews (from epinions, dpreview.com etc) and decided the Oly took the best photographs. 

I eventually had to decide between the Canon S-110 and the Olympus C-2040. The S-110 is much smaller and looks much cooler. The Canon is also supposed to have a much better interface than the Oly. But the clincher for me was that the Oly had much much more manual options. You can set the aperture and/or shutter speed, and focus manually if you want. I'm sure there are other options that I will discover in time. I do plan on experimenting with my digital camera, so these options set the Oly apart. Of course, if you dont't want these manual options the Oly has an Auto mode as well that does everything for you.

So, if you want the tiniest camera around, go for the Canon S-110. If you are willing to compromise on size and get a bigger camera (that is still quite small) that takes great photos, and allows you the option of manually setting several parameters, the Oly C-2040 is simply the best.
