            <b>Update</b>

Just wanted to give you all an update on what I think of this camera after a few more months.  I would still heartily give this product 5 stars, even though there are plenty of 3+ Megapixel cameras out there.  The reasons below remain valid, however, since I wrote this first review I have dabbled in building a family website.  Feel free to check it out if you like:

If you go to this URL, you will find many pictures.  The majority of these pictures I took with the Epson.  (Not the underwater pics!)  While there may be better resolution cameras out there, this camera will serve me well into the future for just putting pictures like these on the web.

<b>Epson 850Z</b>

I bought this camera about 7 months ago to replace my older Epson 750Z.  Both cameras take excellent pictures, however with the advances in digital photography the 850Z is well worth the difference.

I take pictures as a hobby, but mostly because I have two little girls that I love to take pictures of.  This camera is extremely easy to use and the LCD screen gives you instant gratification.  Downloading is easy via the USB connection, but I've used the serial connection as well on my laptop with no problems.  The bundled software that comes with the camera is easy to use but may not be powerful enough for the advanced user.

On a recent trip to Disney World, I took over 400 pictures during the week.  I downloaded 50 of the best pics to an internet film processing company.  

See my review for Ofoto:  <i>http://dlsahudak.epinions.com/webs-review-4763-12927159-39C845A9-prod4</i>
The results were truly outstanding!  I could not tell the difference between these pictures and pictures from a high end 35mm.

If you take lots of pictures, or like to do slideshows on your computer or laptop, I highly recommend this camera.
