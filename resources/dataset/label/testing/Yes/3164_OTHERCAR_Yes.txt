            Last year we decided to buy a second car.  For two years we both shared a 1994 Pontiac Sunbird that ran fine and still does.  But the wife was starting a new job up north about an hour away, and she was going to go to school to get her degree.  So I went searching...

There were six choices.  A 1988 Mercury Topaz with &quot;only 25,000 miles on it&quot; (almost fell apart when I test drove it), A 1993 Sunbird with 69,000 miles, the 1995 Camaro with 49K miles, a 1990 Buick Century with 99K, a 1994 Chevy Caprice with 45K, but way too big, and a 1992 Nissan Maxima with 70K.  The Caprice, Topaz, Maxima, and Century were not options when I test drove them.  All the engines had noises I couldn't figure out where they came from.  The Camaro and the Sunbird were the last two I had to decide from.

Seeing as how the Sunbird we own was such a good car, I was seriously consider buying it.  The asking price was $5,000, which wasn't bad for the car because it was well-maintained and very clean.  The Camaro was in very good condition, even in better shape than the Sunbird was, but the seller was asking 10,500 for it.  So I went home to do a little research.

I called my mom who works for the police records department to run a check on the cars while I get quotes on insurance for either car.  Are you ready for this?  The Camaro was $55 CHEAPER (6 month policy) than our Sunbird, and $75 cheaper than the Sunbird I was looking to buy!  Then my mom called back and gave me the results of the investigations.  The blue book value on the Sunbird was $2,950, and it was involved in a serious accident a few months before, so that explained why it was for sale.  Usually when smaller cars get in big accidents after they are repaired they never run the same, or have ongoing suspension or steering problems.  The blue book for the Camaro was $12,500, so then I knew I should go for the Camaro because if the owner was willing to go that far below Blue book, he wanted to get rid of it for some reason.

I called the seller of the Camaro and gave the car a full inspection, fluids, tires, (only 3,500 miles of wear--practically new) engine performance, brakes, exhaust, etc.  He just moved to WI from Virginia, so salt has never touched the car, meaning no rust at all.  He has a family of 4 children, so there's absolutely no way he can get all the kids in the car.  He owns an SUV and a minivan, which meant he can't afford three car payments and three insurances.  He also reduced the price to $9,400, which meant he was missing payments.  So I offered him $9,200 and he accepted.

I have had the car for a year and I can safely say that if I have to get rid of it, I'd trade it for another Camaro.  It has a nice ride, the engine is very low maintenance, the Bohs 5-speaker stereo-cassette system kicks serious booty, and the engine feels very powerful.  The only thing is that it's a little cramped, and only maybe three people can fit.  It's very fuel efficient, and the insurance is very reasonable with the dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, and automatic seat belts.  This is the first time I have ever seen an economic sports car.<br><br>
