            OK OK, not a very imaginative title, I know!

I recently had an opportunity to test drive a Ford Focus SE Sedan. To summarize, it's an attractive car, both inside and out. It has a reasonably comfortable ride, with a nice featureset for the price. 

Now on to the things I noticed

On the inside:

The telescoping steering wheel makes finding the most comfortable driving position even better. That alone got an excellent mark from me. The seats are also comfortable, and they match the other interior treatments nicely. However, while the telescoping steering wheel is a great feature, the difficulty of adjusting the drivers seat offsets this. Try THIS experiment:

1) close the doors of the car
2) Try adjusting lumbar, etc..
3) If your hand is average sized or larger you cannot squeeze your hand between the seat and the door. you'll have to open the door to adjust the seat.

The plastics seem a little cheap. They are hard and parts of the dashboard don't seem to blend as well as I prefer. However, the young people this car is most geared for will likely find this treatment attractive. 

I personally do not like the fact that from a driving position you cannot see the front of the car. I prefer to be able to see the hoodline to judge distances between myself and other vehicles better. Again, this is a personal preference and other people prefer to NOT see the hood.

On the outside

I find the exterior of the sedan to be more attractive than the 3 door hatch. The hatch seems to have an odd placement for the brake lights and this, to me, makes the back of the car look like a tub. The sedan, with its' more traditional placement of the lights is much more attractive to me.

Driving Experience

All in all the Focus handles reasonably well for a car in its' size and price range. Turning was responsive and the car handled rough pavement with aplomb. This is somewhat offset by the noise level, however. The car has more road noise and engine noise than I would prefer in a car of this class and price range. The engine and road is always present. Coupled with the heating/cooling fan there's always noise in the car.

This is an important aspect of refinement level and unfortunately, hurts the overall level of refinement. I currently own a 2001 Hyundai Elantra and it feels a whole magnitude more refined as far as noise goes. Road noise is MUCH more subdued. The fan at medium speed is barely discernable. I KNOW Ford can improve the noise level in the Focus if Hyundai can do so far nearly $2000 less!

Final notes

I like the Focus, especially the fun to drive looks! However, other issues, mainly the noise level, seat adjustments, and overall driving position with respect to the hood visibility are serious deterrents to me.
