            INTRODUCTION

Recently, my family has purchased a 1996 GMC Suburban 2500 SLT 4x4. We bought it off of a friend w/91,000 miles and paid only $10,000. 

EXTERIOR

For seven years old, the body remains in mint condition. IT is a metallic dark purple w/silver body cladding and surrounding. It came with factory running boards and houses 17" wheels and tires. Exteriorally, it is a very attractive SUV.

INTERIOR

After seven years, the gray leather remains in excellent shape. It is ever so comfortable for short and long trips. The space is immensive, as it holds eight passengers comfortably with all the gear. The dashboard is a simple, easy layout w/a half-circle tach, speedometer, other gauges, and a NICE AM/FM Cassette Sound System w/CD Player. The sound is superb w/bass and treble cranked all the way up. Ours also has power seats, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, compass, cruise control, which all work and work well. Also, entry to the Suburban is not difficult whatsoever, even our dog could jump in the back with ease. The windshield is nice and large with low cowl and allows for expansive visibility of the horizon ahead. A great safety feature. Dual airbags are standard. 

PERFORMANCE

Our Suburban is the 2500 Series, or 3/4 Ton. I think this is no longer available today. The engine is the classic American Big-Block 454, which is a 7.4L V8! I'm not sure if it is even available on the current Suburban or even the Denali. It DEFINITELY has get up and go, but feels only above average and not extreme because of the weight of this vehicle. The 4-Speed Automatic Transmission paired w/this engine does a decent job shifting effortlessly like other automatics. Being on a truck frame, the ride is quite nice. Bumps are hardly felt and the highway performance is impeccable. The cabin also remains quiet while driving. For gas mileage, we get 17MPG. That is the same as what I got on my '93 F150 w/the 300 4.9L I6 engine. Anyways, 17MPG is EXCELLENT for a Suburban w/a 454 engine! Brakes are large and stop with authority -and nicely as well. 

** 4-WHEEL DRIVE **
The system on the Suburban is an "on-the-fly" 4-wheel drive by a switch next to the steering wheel. While we haven't used it yet, our '79 Suburban we used to have was great in the snow!

RELIABILITY

Our friend bought this SUV four years ago, and up to until now he only had the fuel pump go out on it. That has been fixed. However, our only issue is the A/C doesn't work. Only the heater and defroster do. We will get this fixed. Otherwise, Suburbans are family-friendly and reliable to drive.

CONCLUSION

For families looking for a nicely-equipped SUV that is perfect for traveling, then I recommend the Suburban!
