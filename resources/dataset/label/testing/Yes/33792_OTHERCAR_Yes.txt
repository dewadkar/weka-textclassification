            By definition, we � that is, those of us who aren�t millionaires buying vehicles every week � rarely get to write reviews on cars we own. I thought it would be interesting to write a review of the car I recently ordered, a MINI Cooper S, dealing with what actually led to my purchase decision. Since I also drove the base Cooper, this review covers both models.

A long test drive and some related research can certainly provide everything one needs to write a thorough and helpful review of any vehicle. In fact, in some ways, these are the most impartial reviews of all, since they aren�t tainted by pride of ownership or other rose-tinted sentiments. But on the other hand, there is something, for me at least, about the excitement tinged with angst that comes with making a purchase as substantial as a new car that can produce a more �heartfelt� review. That�s what I�m hoping, at least.

Finally, I should add that I plan to update this review after I�ve owned and driven the MINI for enough time to offer an opinion based on the more tangible experience of living with the car day-to-day.

<b>Rationalizing the irrational�</b>

In many respects, buying a new car is fundamentally irrational. It represents a large outlay for a rapidly depreciating asset. Most of us use our cars for utilitarian tasks that could be performed by any vehicle, a 1986 Corolla hatchback or a brand new BMW M5. If we all invested even half of the money we spend on cars, gas and insurance, many of us would be able to retire ten years earlier.

Then we get to the MINI Cooper / Cooper S. It�s a tiny vehicle. The back seat is so small, you�d have to be some kind of masochist voluntarily to spend more than ten minutes sitting there. The trunk has just about enough room for a few grocery bags. I know that the chrome detailing and jewel-like detailing will mean hefty insurance claims if I�m ever unfortunate enough to get into an accident. The Cooper S that I ordered competes with the Ford Focus SVT, VW GTI 1.8T, Honda Civic SiR (Si in the US), Acura RSX Type S, Chrysler PT Cruiser GT, Toyota Celica GT-S� and many others. Each of these cars is at least one of the following: bigger, faster, cheaper to buy, cheaper to insure, more practical, and so on.

The other cars I seriously considered were the BMW 325i and Audi A4 1.8T Quattro, both of which are great to drive, stylish and far more practical than the MINI. Sure, they are both more expensive, but overall I�d say that their value for money quotient is probably a good deal higher. The Audi in particular is beautifully styled, and the interior design and build quality is unmatched by any other auto manufacturer, at least in its segment. The BMW 325i is from my perspective the ultimate BMW, combining peerless handling and driver involvement also found on much more expensive BMW models, with a reasonable price.

So already, choosing the MINI seems to be irrational on many levels, which leads me to my next point: the real reason I bought the MINI was quite simply because I really, really wanted it. Some of the reasons for this impulse include excellent handling, stand out styling and build quality, relative scarcity and its compact size and decidedly non-SUV image. But beyond these (mostly) sensible factors, it all came down to a much more intangible emotional appeal, which conspired to lead me to hand over my $1,000 deposit to the friendly MINI dealership. Without wanting to get too new age, I�ll admit that it �spoke to me��

The fact that I actually committed my deposit before I�d driven a Cooper S (although I had previously spent an hour with a base Cooper with Sport package) is further evidence that I wasn�t letting cold, hard logic stand in the way of my decision. Even the less-than-perfect aspects of the Cooper S�s dynamics I noted on my subsequent drive did nothing to make me think about changing my mind.

<b>OK, enough of this philosophical rubbish, what�s it like to drive?</b>

A good question, and my short answer is that it�s great, but not perfect. I�m mostly in agreement with the glowing reviews written by Car and Driver, Road & Track, Edmunds, Carpoint and just about everybody else: the MINI handles better than any car of its size, and in fact better than just about <i>anything</i> else I�ve ever driven, save the afore-mentioned 3-series BMW.

The steering is fantastic, not too firm, not too light, and sharply responsive, with great road feel communicated to the driver. Some might find its responses a little too sharp and �darty�, but once you get used to it, it verges on telepathic and it�s extremely easy to place the vehicle exactly where you want it in a corner. Almost no evidence of understeer, too. I wouldn�t say the MINI is �go-kart-like�, since it always feels quite substantial; instead it is consummately composed and sure-footed, which may mean it isn�t quite a 10 on the fun to drive scale, but as an all-round driver it�s outstanding.

Body roll is practically non existent. In my original drive in the base Cooper with optional sports package (Canadian spec. includes firmer suspension, 16� alloys and run-flat summer tires), I utterly terrified my passenger (a friend of mine who came along for the drive � the dealer was fine with us taking the vehicle without a salesperson on board). Taking a challenging S-bend, complete with warning signs urging drivers to stay below 40 km/h (25 mph), at speeds approaching 95 km/h (about 55 mph), I felt completely in control. In fact, I didn�t really think I�d done anything ambitious until I noticed my passenger, ashen faced and white knuckling on the handbrake grip, his other hand clasped in a death grip on the door trim. At the next stop light, he managed to croak, �Let�s take the car back, you�re really scaring me now.�

Several weeks later when I drove a Cooper S (with Sports package, which in Canada means 17� wheels, even firmer suspension, and BMW�s Dynamic Stability Control (DSC)), all of the above comments apply, the only difference being that it felt like even more grip was available, and the car felt absolutely impossible to throw off course. And obviously the extra 48 horsepower make quite a difference, too, but I�ll get to this later�

I found the ride on the Cooper to be firm but not harsh. Vancouver�s cracked and buckled pavement didn�t transmit unnecessary vibration or bumps. On the Cooper S, the Sports package�s larger wheels and lower profile rubber, combined with the firmer suspension, were perhaps a little much for everyday driving. When I placed my order, I suspected this might be the case, and had read as much in various reviews, so I didn�t check the Sports package option. My vehicle will have the standard 16� wheels with all-season run flats. I also didn�t order the DSC, which is available as a stand-alone option as well as in the Sports package. Given how tenaciously the base Cooper handles without it, I�m sure you would have to be driving well beyond the limits of public roads to <i>need</i> this technology to intervene. The quick explanation of DSC, by the way, according to BMW�s website, is that it monitors attributes such as speed, �yaw�, lateral acceleration, steering speed and so on, and will apply braking to any of the four wheels, or reduce engine power as needed to correct a skid.

The five speed manual transmission in the base Cooper is outstanding. Perfect short but decisive throws, with just enough mechanical feel to communicate real engagement between the driver and the car. The clutch is well weighted with relatively short travel and a biting point that is not too high, the bottom line being that it is extremely easy to get the Cooper off the line rapidly, and I found myself changing gear far more often than was necessary just for the hell of it. Normally when I drive a vehicle for the first time, it takes a few miles to get the shift action just right; in the Cooper it took no time at all, even from first to second.

Of course, since the Cooper only has 115 horsepower to play with from its 1.6 liter four cylinder engine, it�s probably a good thing that the transmission is so excellent. However, I never felt the base Cooper to be seriously underpowered. The gear ratios are extremely well spaced, meaning that acceleration is quite rapid in low gears and high speed cruising is comfortable. Manufacturer�s statistics show a 0-62 mph / 0-100 km/h time of just over nine seconds, but I�ve seen road tests in Top Gear, Autocar and Car (all British publications), where times in the mid-to-high eights were achieved. Further evidence in my mind that absolute speed and acceleration are far less important than driver involvement.

The base engine doesn�t make the most exciting sound in the world, tending to be buzzy and loud at higher speeds, but not intrusively so, since the cabin appears to be well soundproofed.

I expected the Cooper S�s supercharged version of the same engine, combined with its standard 6-speed transmission, to provide simply a greatly enhanced version of the Cooper�s performance. After all, its 163 horsepower and 155 lb/ft of torque compare well with the 115 hp / 110 lb/ft of the base Cooper. This wasn�t exactly the case, particularly when it came to the shift action and gear ratios of the 6-speed. The throw felt quite a bit longer and less precise, and I found the gap between third and fourth gears to be a little too large. The slightly mechanical feel of the Cooper�s shifter is just right, but in the Cooper S it verges on a little too notchy. Overall, I�m not sure the 6-speed is the advantage it should be.

The Cooper S I drove only had about 250 kilometers on the clock (just over 150 miles), but even taking this into account it felt more reluctant to rev than the Cooper (which had covered nearly 4,000 km / 2,500 miles when I got behind the wheel and was therefore quite well run in). That said, the performance advantage is considerable, particularly when it comes to in-gear acceleration. Floor the gas pedal in third at 30 mph in the Cooper S and it surges ahead; do the same in the Cooper and it�s clear you�re in a much less powerful vehicle. This advantage is reflected in the performance statistics, which show the Cooper S as having a 0-62 mph time of just over seven seconds, and a top speed of 135 mph.

Perhaps it sounds as if I�m talking myself out of the Cooper S and back into the base Cooper, but the extra urge provided by the supercharger more than compensates in my mind for the issues I found with the transmission and less free-revving engine. Ideally, I�d have the Cooper S�s performance with the sweetness of the Cooper, but unfortunately that�s not an option you can check on the spec. sheet. What I would say is that the base Cooper provides enough real-world performance to make it extremely fun to drive, particularly if your driving doesn�t often extend to long, high-speed trips. As a second or weekend car, it�s ideal.

<b>Design and quality</b>

Design and styling are areas in which the MINI, in any configuration, is simply miles ahead of its competition, and were a strong factor in my decision. Managing to capture the spirit of the original MINI in a much bigger, more modern vehicle is a great achievement, but the new MINI does much more than this. The car is unmistakably a MINI (especially for those of us born and raised across the pond�), but it�s also fresh and modern, and in no sense derivative.

The VW Beetle in particular makes considerable sacrifices by aping the shape of the original (ever sat in the back seat, or driven one and stared over what seems like three feet of dashboard between you and the windshield?), and at the same time manages to appear somewhat cynical in its use of the old Beetle�s shape. For one thing, it forces a shape designed for a rear-engined vehicle onto a front-engined one, and there are inevitable negative consequences. The MINI, by contrast, feels lovingly crafted and thoroughly engineered, from the jewel-like chrome detailing of the radiator grill to the turn signals and rear light clusters. Its stance is aggressive and the shape perfectly proportioned, partly as a function of the wheels, which are pushed right out to the four corners of the car.

I would recommend going for the Sports package in the base Cooper, since the standard 15� alloys (or those included in the Premium package) look a little insubstantial. The cross-spoke alloys that are standard on the Cooper S strike just the right balance between aggression and overkill, and I actually prefer them visually to the 17� �minilite� style offered by the Cooper S�s Sports package. If required, you can order white-painted wheels as a no-cost option, to match the white roof and mirror caps that are also available (and which I did order).

Inside, the Cooper and Cooper S are virtually identical, with the most immediately obvious feature being the giant, centrally mounted speedometer (the large tachometer is behind the steering wheel, right in front of the driver). If you order the Navigation package, the speedometer moves to a more conventional position next to the tach to make way for the GPS system�s LCD display. The entire dash, door trim and surrounds of the center stack are finished with metallic trim, which on the Cooper S comes complete with a rather unusual �footprint-like� finish.

Overall, I�d say that the interior works well, but the dash materials and column stalks could be of higher quality, and I have a feeling that the central speedometer will mean more tickets as I fail to check my speed. I have a nagging feeling it will look quite dated in a couple of years, but probably not so much that I won�t be able to live with it.

The front seats are extremely comfortable (although that�s just a comment from two relatively short drives) and supportive; they�re quite firm with plenty of lateral support for hard cornering. Both models I drove were optioned with leatherette, but the model I ordered has silver and black �Space� cloth. Personally I really dislike the whole leatherette thing � for a start, it seems deceptive to call it anything other than vinyl, and it never comes close enough to emulating leather, while at the same time being more prone to getting uncomfortable in hot weather.

As for the back seat, well it�s perhaps something of an exaggeration to call it a real back seat. It�s certainly not a place adults would want to spend any length of time. Strictly for very young children or your worst enemies, I fear. The trunk, similarly, is tiny, only about seven cubic feet, just enough room for a few grocery bags. At least the rear seats fold down. Those who regularly need to carry two golf bags and rear passengers really shouldn�t buy a MINI, and almost any of the hot hatch / sports coupe competition offers more room for rear passengers and luggage. Oh well, I never claimed the MINI was a practical vehicle.

Build quality, from my two brief encounters, appears to be outstanding. Panel gaps are as tight as anything from Toyota, the doors close with a deeply satisfying thud, and the hood cover�s hydraulic supports and the tightly packed engine bay are works of engineering excellence. Details such as the chromed shifter and door handles only add to the perceived quality.

<b>Pricing and equipment</b>

There are some differences between Canadian and US specification and pricing, the biggest of which appears to be that Canadian consumers get a much better deal.

My Cooper S�s final pre-tax price of $32,395 Canadian, including Indi Blue metallic paint, heated seats, A/C tax, freight and PDI works out to be approximately $20,600 US. Keep in mind that Canadian standard specification includes Xenon headlamps, headlamp washers and heated mirrors, and the saving works out to be more than $1,000 US, before PDI. This situation is skewed further when you take into account the fact that Canadian dealers are selling at MSRP, while many US dealers are charging a significant premium (and if you�ve been to eBay Motors recently, you�ll see dozens of Cooper and Cooper S models at similarly inflated prices). The only downside? Canadian dealers are requiring purchasers to sign an agreement saying that they will not sell their vehicle for 12 months without giving the dealer first right of refusal, mainly to prevent this type of price gouging. On balance, it seems like a reasonable trade-off.

Other standard equipment includes power windows and mirrors, remote locks, six speaker in-dash CD, electronic immobilizer, four wheel discs with electronic ABS, ASC+T traction and stability control, six airbags, leather steering wheel and height adjustable driver and passenger seats. Nothing extraordinary, but generally quite competitive. One of the main differences between the MINI�s specification and that of its competitors is that it leans more towards safety and security than to luxury. While it�s possible to get an Acura RSX, Honda Civic Si / SiR, Focus SVT or Golf GTI 1.8T with more luxury items than the MINI for the same or a lower price, none of these vehicles offers Xenon headlamps or as sophisticated a traction control system (in the case of the Civic and the Acura, there is no traction control as standard or even as an option).

Base pricing for the Cooper S in the US is $19,975 including freight, but the many options can rapidly add to the price, and in my view they are mostly unnecessary. The benefit to factory ordering a MINI is that you�ll be able to throttle back on the options, whereas most of the models that are in dealerships seem to have thousands� worth of options.

Metallic paint adds $400, the Sports package is $1,250, the Premium package (including automatic climate control, panoramic sunroof, multi-function wheel and a trip computer) also $1,250, with the Cold Weather package at $300 (heated seats, mirrors and headlamp washers). Of these, I�d take only the Cold Weather. I�d avoid the Sport for the reasons I�ve already mentioned, and my experience with the climate control system on my S tester was not at all positive. The controls are difficult to understand, the display is hard to read, and overall it seems more trouble than it�s worth.

Some of the more ridiculous options include a $1,600 navigation system (which is BMW�s rather outdated CD-based system), park distance control (yes, really, on one of the smallest cars on sale in North America�) and a Harman/Kardon sound system. This latter one is ridiculous not in and of itself, but instead because it seems completely theoretical: it�s listed as an option, but MINI keeps postponing the date by which it will actually be available. It was originally slated for launch, then October, but now it�s been pushed back to December.

In the case of the $16,425 base Cooper, I�d add metallic paint and the $1,250 Sports package, which adds 16� wheels, sports seats, run-flat tires and DSC. The wheels are the most important part of this package, since they greatly improve the car�s appearance.

A VW GTI is available for around $22,000, including the 180 horsepower 1.8T engine, leather, 17� wheels, and the Sports and Luxury packages. The 200 horsepower Acura RSX Type S is available for just over $23,000. I have driven both of these vehicles, and plan to write reviews soon. The 170 horsepower Focus SVT starts at just over $19,000, while the 160 horsepower Civic Si also stickers for $19,000. All of these vehicles offer certain advantages over the Cooper S: the GTI is a larger, faster car, with a more practical yet also beautifully built interior; the Acura is a faster, also larger, and offers excellent handling and quality; I haven�t driven the Focus or the Civic, so can�t comment except to say they are both well equipped, practical and have been well reviewed elsewhere.

However, none of these or other competitors offer the individuality or style of the MINI. The GTI also doesn�t come close to the MINI as a driver�s car; it�s more of a rapid long distance cruiser, too heavy and unresponsive to cut it as a true hot hatch. The RSX has an outstanding engine (certainly better than the MINI�s), and pin-sharp handling, but to me it felt too boy racer in design and intent, and the blandness of its design leaves a lot to be desired.

<b>Conclusions</b>

In the end, what it comes down to, more than the driving experience, design details and image, is whether or not you click with the MINI�s style. And of course, whether you can live with the limited practicality. I�m not sure if the lack of space in the back seat and trunk will prove to be a problem, but that�s the price you pay for making irrational decisions�
