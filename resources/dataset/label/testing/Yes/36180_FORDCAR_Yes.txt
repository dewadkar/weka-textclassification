            Having taken ownership of a 2000 ZTS model, I thought I would share my thoughts.  First and foremost, I like the car.  It is my first Ford product.  The fit and finish quality equals or betters any of the imports I've looked into.  The engine at idle is hardly audible and the controls are ample in size and thoughtfully located.

I have the five speed transmission.  It shifts smoothly and allows you to get up to speed quickly.  My cloud nine white paint job is near perfection and the white is WHITE - looking brighter and cleaner than any other white car I park next to.

The cabin space is very roomy (I have not had four adults on board yet) but rear seat space seems ample.

If your looking for a small car that is very classy inside and out, give the Focus a test drive.  I think you will be impressed.
