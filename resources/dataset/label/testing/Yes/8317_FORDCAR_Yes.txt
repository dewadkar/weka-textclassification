            I love my car.  Beat up and dirty as it is, we have been through a lot together.  I was moving away to college and at the time, I had the family car--Dodge Ram Charger--loved it!!  But it was on its last legs and I needed something a little more fuel efficient for the constant trips between San Antonio (me) and Austin (my boyfriend) and Dallas (my family).  I also wanted something, dare I say it, a little more girly.  I wanted a small compact little sports car, that still had enough oomph to satisfy the race car driver buried not too deeply in me.  So off I went and fell in love with a turquoise green 1993 Ford Probe with an automatic sunroof.  It zoomed and wove through Dallas traffic with ease.  
Just over a week after I purchased it, my sister and I drove it from Dallas to Southern California.  Those who have driven it know--it is a very long drive--approx. 23 hours.  We only had to fill up every four to five hours and with a 13.5 gallon tank it was cheap.  The seats were comfortable for the entire way.  
Now that I have moved down to central Texas, the Ford has come with me.  It is now covered in dents, due to the suicidal driving of the people in Austin.  The stereo was stolen TWICE in San Antonio, and has yet to be replaced.  The windshield is now cracked.  Slowly but surely, my precious car is coming to its end.  Yet, it still turns heads when I weave crazily through Austin traffic (getting worse every day!)  I will drive this car until it &quot;dies.&quot;  <br><br>
