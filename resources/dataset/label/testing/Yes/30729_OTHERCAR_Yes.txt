            About a year ago I bought my '96 Achieva. I wasn't very excited about getting it at the time because I wanted something sporty. But I bought this car because it was only $5,000. At the time it had 85,000 miles. My first thought was that I had just bought a car that was going to break down within the first few months. That couldn't have been farther from the truth. 1 year and nearly 20,000 miles later I took my car in to get the first repair on it. The brake pads and rotors. This car performs far above my expectations. For being my first car it is very comfortable. I test drove many cars last year and quite frankly, its hard to find a car that a 6'10&quot; man can fit into. The Achieva has excellent handling and stability. I've had my car going 55mph down a snow covered, country road without even the slightest flinch. The 3.1L V6 also gives the Achieva a surprising kick. The 191 hp gives this car amazing acceleration.<br><br>
