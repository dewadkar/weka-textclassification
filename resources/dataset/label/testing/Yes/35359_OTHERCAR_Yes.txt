            I personally did not buy this car. My parents own this Volvo of which I am speaking. When I got in my car accident, my parents still owned the car that was wrecked. Thusly, they got the money for the totaling of my Ford Tempo. 
My father is fifty-something and he has lived his whole life wanting the best of everything. 
Well, I came home one day after work, and my garage was open.
Hmmm, curious.
As I approached, I discovered that this huge car was a Volvo 850 Turbo with EVERY option you could ever hope for. It is white and tinted, and it has bun-warmers and leather seats. It has fog lamps and power everything and a cd changer. I was excited despite my irritation that my father went out and spent $18,000 on a car that was five years old. 
I got in and sat down, sank in and fell in love. 
'Puddles' is his name. 
Well, i'll tell you the reason why. I came home the next day, and the car was no longer in the garage. &quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;Where is the Volvo?&quot;
&quot;It's in the shop. It leaks oil.&quot; My father replied. 
I felt like laughing, but held myself back because he wanted this car so badly. 
It turns out that in their extensive engine flushing and maintenance (Pre-sale) they had failed to tighten a little bolt on the belly of the car. 
The next problem that arose was that the power button that rolled down the driver's side window would stick. Well, Volvo promptly fixed that problem.
I remember my dad saying &quot;That's the only design flaw I found. They shouldn't have put the drink holder right over the electric panel.&quot; 
I must tell you that this car rides like a . . . umm . . . like a  Volvo. :)
It's beautiful. It is so quiet and clean and warm and cozy. It has every button for a curious finger, and is welcoming during a cold winter storm. 
Yeah, I may have been a little angry at first, but now that I have had a chance to drive &quot;Puddles&quot;, I have had thoughts about buying one myself.  <br><br>
