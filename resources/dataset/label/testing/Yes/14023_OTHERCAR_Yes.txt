            Well, I just bought my 1998 Pontiac Sunfire last week, but I love the car. My car is black, automatic, two-doors, a coupe, and has ABS. I bought it used with about 54000 KM on it (33500mi) for $9500 CDN ($6000US).

What really drew me to the Sunfire originally, was the combination of looks and price. The car looks good, and it really isn't very expensive. Given a choice, which I was, essentially, between a couple years old Sunfire and a brand new hatchback, it isn't a tough decision. The car looks good, especially for such an economical car.

Another big reason I wanted the car is for handling. I live in Canada, and so the roads are icy for about four months of the year. The Sunfire, paired with Blizzak tires, is easy to drive through any conditions. Front-wheel-drive eliminates fish-tailing, taking out the cause of most (of my) accidents right there. Also, the car has ABS, and a traction control system. In fact, if the car's wheels start to slip, and you don't notice (because you have music up loud, or whatever), a light comes on in the dash telling you. The car is also relatively low to the ground, which aids the handling.

I've seen a couple reviews here portray the car as uncomfortable, but for me this really isn't the case. Although the roof of the car is a bit low, it's not low enough to present a problem for me, at 6'0", it's still a few inches above my head. Also, I found the seats to be very comfortable. On the drive back from purchasing the car, I drove for about five hours straight, and I didn't feel any ill-effects from the seat. To the contrary, I feel good. No back pain or anything like that, which I often experience in much shorter trips in other vehicles.

As far as power goes, the car is certainly adequate. It can accelerate quickly and maintain highways speeds easily, even up long uphill stretches. I can't really tell you how fast the car will go or anything like that however, because it is winter and the roads are too icy to be trying much of that stuff.

So, in conclusion, I am quite happy with the car, and would certainly recommend it to others.
