            The Amigo is the perfect vehicle for those who want a more refined version of the Jeep Wrangler, or a more macho version of the Ford Explorer Sport.  Unlike many of the other smaller sport-utes on the market, The Amigo (like the Explorer and to some extent the Wrangler) are based on mid-sized platforms, and retain the larger motors, frames, suspension, width and height of their big brothers. 

The friend of mine who purchased the Amigo wanted something that would be good in the muddy, snowy conditions of NE rural roads, sand driving on the Outer Banks, and something that wasn�t too large for crowded urban conditions.  Also didn�t want a bland or generic-looking SUV.  The Amigo fits this bill perfectly.  With the same width, height and tires from the Rodeo but with a 14� mid-section removed, the Amigo looks quite athletic and seems as if it could tackle any off-road situation.  With a real truck frame, low-range, and good torque from the 3.2L V6 (which has returned 19-23 mpg), it is certainly capable of taking a driver far farther than most owners will ever go off-road.  So far, the owner has been pleased with the performance in the soft sand of the Outer Banks as well as some rutted, muddy roads in Vermont in spring.

Being in NE, the soft top wasn�t an option.  This is were the Amigo suffers.  While it does sport two large manual sunroofs, you can�t easily remove the hardtop and replace it with a soft top like the Wrangler.  Some have tried and it is possible, but it is not recommended by Isuzu so the process is fairly involved.  Another disadvantage is that for some reason, a manual transmission is not offered with the V6 hardtop 4x4 option.  C�mon Isuzu, the Amigo is designed for young folks who buy manuals, hardtop or not!

Moving to the inside, there�s no squeaks or rattles after 15K miles, and the rather boring (same say cheap) materials are holding up well.  The rear seat is very spacious for two full-size adults.  The cargo area while small, is still useful.   Fold the seats down (and flip them up if so desired) leaves a large rectangular cargo area.  

Another disadvantage of the hardtop are the sunroofs.  Since they are manual, you need to pop them out if you want the full affect.  The only real place to store them is on the floor of the cargo area, which means you really can�t have anything else back there.  The solution?  I made a platform just high enough for the sunroofs and shades to slide under (about 4� or so) while still allowing you to have cargo.  It works perfectly, but Isuzu should offer something like it or even throw it in for free.

Driving the Amigo is a relaxing affair.  Road noise is muted for an SUV with large meaty tires, the steering is numb like most modern vehicles, but the variable assist does a decent job of giving some sense of feedback.  The brakes (4 wheel discs) are strong and have a decent pedal feel.  The suspension, while great off-road is bouncy and a bit soft for road driving.  You lean and dive quite a bit while going around corners or braking, and recovery after hitting a pothole unsettles the whole vehicle.  Many have said that replacing the shocks for stiffer ones that match the springs better improves things drastically, and will certainly be on the list when it comes time.

In terms of quality, I�m a Mopar fan myself, and have a first year Neon that I haven�t had any problems with, and my parents had a 1981 Omni that lasted 10 years with no more than routine maintenance.   I�m not scared by Consumer Report statistics at all.  The price of the Amigo, at just over 20K (sticker of 23.7) certainly makes up for any trips back to the dealer.  It has been back three times, once for a recall on the rear suspension, and two other times for a failed fuel sender unit, with the first replacement being the wrong one (or so the second mechanic had mentioned).

I heartily recommend the Amigo to those that want a smaller, real SUV that you won�t see a thousand of while driving to work.  It packs in quite a bit of equipment into the perfect-sized package that isn�t too large to drive in the city or too small to be impractical.
