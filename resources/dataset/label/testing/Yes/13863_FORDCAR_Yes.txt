            I bought my SVT because of the value for the price.  It had come down to the SVT and the Catera.  The SVT was 90% of the car for 1/2 the price.

The classic appearance, the handling and the amenities are what I love.  There is nothing that I hate.

The Contour SVT is a thrilling car to own and drive.  It becomes an extension of your body with its responsive handling and smooth acceleration. 

The 10 way power seat allows for infinite minor adjustments making long trips or short drives equally comfortable.

I've put 65,000 trouble free miles on mine.  Normal maintainence is all that has been required.

I've owned my 98 for two years and still find it exciting to look at and a delight to drive.

It is a car that has brought comments from small kids and adults alike.
One four year old looked at and said, &quot;Cool car mister!&quot;

It is not a car for the timid  or Sunday driver.  for someone who wants a bond with the vehicle it is an ideal choice.<br><br>
