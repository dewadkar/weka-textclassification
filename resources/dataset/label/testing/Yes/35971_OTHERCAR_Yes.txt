            I'm a teenager and my parents bought me a Civic Sedan EX 99' for my first car. It's perfect for a teenager's first car. It handles like a dream, it can handle any corner and u-turns are not a problem. It only takes $10 to fill up the tank which is great because teenagers never have a lot of money to throw around. The back seat fits all my friends comfortably,and  the trunk is big enough to haul all of our gear around. The sound system is decent, not great, but decent. It doesn't accelerate really fast because it is a 4-cylinder, but that makes my parents happy. This car has all the safety features and luxuries for a good price. We bought it brand new for only $17,000 which is a great price for a brand new car. It gets me from Point A to Point B safely and happily.<br><br>
