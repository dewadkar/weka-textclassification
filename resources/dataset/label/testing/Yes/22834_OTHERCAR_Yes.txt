            I first learned about the Integra from my boyfriend.  He had nothing but good words for it.  I promptly crashed that car (hydroplaned an '87) and we have had a string of Integras ever since.  It was our goal to own as many as possible.  Most we ever owned at one time: 4.

What did we like so much about these cars?

1. Style: The Integra is sporty without being overindulgent.  It is a 4 cylinder so it gets good gas mileage and doesn't gass guzzle.  One can get the car with options from stock to real fancy.  One looks real cool in an Integra - especially with tinted windows and a nice sound system (no huge woofers please!!!).  The style holds.  Most people tell me my car looked (it's gone now) new - but it was 10 years old!  People found that hard to believe.  AND this car was purchased in NY where cars rust real bad and real easily.

2. Handling:  The car handles like it is on rails (Pretty Woman).  Sticks to the road, tight around corners, good road feel, perfect steering, and great acceleration - especially for a 4 cylinder 10 year old car!.

3. Power and Speed:  My personal favorite is that the Integra is a 4 cylinder, but has great power, acceleration, and speed.  

4. Quality: In all the Integras I have known, none have had to visit the shop except for regular wear and tear (and even that is not bad for a 10 year old car!).  You can't beat dual overhead cams and 16 valves - a step above all Hondas (a lot of people will compare the Acuras to Hondas since the guts are both built by Honda, but the Acura is just a higher quality)

5. Holds its worth - My car which was pancaked by a driver who obviously did not understand the principles of physics, was totaled by the insurance company but still worth $1000 to the junkyard.  Also, for a car that was worth about $13,000 purchased new 10 years ago, and worth about $6000 on a used dealer's lot is a pretty good worth-holder.

6. You can crash them causing lots of cosmetic damage to the car, but it will still drive and everyone in the car will leave without a scratch (not my fault believe me - I would never want to voluntarily do that to an Integra!)

7. The fog lights - they give GREAT visibility and are totally legal to drive around with on.  The only downfall to this is that most people will think that they are your brights and bright you.  The best solution to this is to bright them back so that both your brights and fog lights are on giving them the &quot;deer in football stadium lights&quot; effect.  Police may even pull you over for having the brights on.  This has happened to me twice, but of course the police had to leave with their head hanging and no ticket issued because I was doing nothing wrong.  

I recommend buying used if you don't have lots of resources.  But don't buy from a dealer.  I have found the best cars coming from private individuals and at great prices.  My experiences with the used cars from dealers has not been as good.  It is also always more expensive to buy from a dealer for supposed restoration costs incurred, but the Integra is so good, there most likely was nothing wrong with the car anyway.

I will be a faithful Acura Integra driver for a long time to come.
