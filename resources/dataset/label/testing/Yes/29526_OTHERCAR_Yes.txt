            I bought this camera about 2 1/2 weeks ago, so the "honeymoon" phase is over so to speak. Overall, I still like this camera as much as the day I bought it. The choosing process for a digital camera was a long one that involved much research on the Internet. Since my price ceiling was $300, it limited my options somewhat as to what I could buy. Originally, I had my mind set on an HP Photosmart 315-the only camera in this price range that offers over 2 MP. Once I saw sample shots from that model, and actually got to examine one in Circuit City, I judged it to be an inferior camera in every respect. It took mediocre pictures compared to most 1.3 MP cameras, the thing was constructed with absolutely no thought given to quality, it had no optical zoom, NO MACRO, and no TV out. Almost all of these features are vital to me, so I decided to look at the best of the 1.3 MP crop. This is what brought me to the DC240. This camera can do everything. It has an OPTICAL zoom so your pics won't lose quality when you zoom as they do with digital zoom, a macro mode for making closeups, a quality LCD screen, a PERFECT viewfinder which almost makes using the LCD wasteful, incredibly sturdy construction, USB for downloads, and a great software bundle. Most importantly for me though, is the fact that this camera on the whole takes outstanding pictures. Especially indoors, the sharpness and color reproduction which this model offers is truly stunning. On outdoor shots, while some can be just as great, others can be painfully average compared to other cameras in its range. This is an easy camera to figure out, and it has a wonderful graphical user interface. Everything seems to have been implemented with the end user in mind. It also has good battery life relative to other digital cameras. With the USB cable, you can download an incredible number of pictures to your hard drive almost instantly. Kodak also includes a serial cable for those who don't have USB ports. The TV out port is a great way to show a large number of people the pics you have taken instantly. The camera also includes a great red eye reduction feature. On the downside, as with all digital cameras that don't cost an absolute fortune, there is a small delay from when you push the button to when the picture is taken. It is not so bad on this model (maybe a second), but it is something to consider. In addition, the camera's lens cap is not particularly well-designed in that it refuses to stay on sometimes. Overall, I highly recommend this camera. I happened to get it for an abnormally low price though. You should expect to pay around $300 for it. Even for that price, it is far superior to the junk Olympus and Fuji sell at this price/MP point.
