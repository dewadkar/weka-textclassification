            Before I drove the Dodge Stratus, I thought it would be impossible to fall in love with a car. However, I found that this is exactly what happened. I don't know much about the mechanics of cars, but this is the most fun to drive and has the best handling of anything I've ever driven. It's got a great shape that looks classy but not stuck-up. The Stratus is a great car for young drivers with many safety features that put parents at ease. It comfortably seats 5 with plenty of leg room in the spacious back seat. My family bought this vehicle because we wanted a car that would be versitile enough for both younger and older drivers. We couldn't have made a better choice. <br><br>
