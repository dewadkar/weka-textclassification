            The '99 Pontiac Grand Prix...a perfect specimen of a low priced sporty car that is perfect for anyone with a relatively low budget and a need for speed!  The best part of this car, in my Epinion (laugh please), is the rapid rate of acceleration when you step on the gas pedal. Never will you get stuck on a hill going slow or have trouble passing someone.  These cars are virtually flawless when it comes to acceleration.  The Grand Prix's sister, the Grand Prix GT is also a great accelerator.  The Grand Prix is equipped with a 3.1 liter V6 and the GT has a 3.8 liter.  The good part about having the 3.1 is it is lighter and allows the car to accelerate even faster, but the 3.8 is much faster.  Overall, i would have to say this is one of the better cars i have driven and will probably remain in my garage for a long time (or until i have enough to buy that Escalade)
