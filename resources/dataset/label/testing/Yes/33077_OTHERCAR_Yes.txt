            My '93 GMC Sonoma was a single cab, everything worked, drove well, had 117K miles on it and paid for.  But my wife needed a trade in for a new car, so I gave her my '93 and decided to buy a '99 extended cab Sonoma.  I like this truck and I like the way it drives; the 5 speed shifts easily and surely, the A/C will frost your lungs and the lumbar support on the driver seat is really great for long trips.  It gets decent milage (even with the tailgate up) and the cd player has always read every dye type CD-R I've ever put in it.  I don't know who makes the actual CD transport for Delco CD players, but they're usually compatable with all CD-R dye types.  Also, the AM reception is good. I can listen to WWL 870 in New Orleans, LA during the afternoon and I live in North East LA.  Typically I don't bother with FM since music on FM, and radio stations in general, sounds pretty bad. If not listening to CD's then it's AM talk radio.

Now the negative part.  The 2.2L inline 4 cylinder engine is way too underpowered.  I wanted to get the 4.3L V-6 but was affraid the insurance would have been a lot more.  The monthly payment would have only been about $10 more per month so that part didn't matter.  Imagine my surprise to find that the insurance would have been the same in cost.  
The stereo is also under powered.  It may have line level (pre-amp outs)outputs on it making an external power amp possible; I've never seen the rear of the unit though.

Some people seem to think it's cool to dog GM products.  My experiences have been positive and I can't see me buying anything other than a GMC or Chevy truck in the future.   
Chrystler products are another matter though.  I like the look of their trucks and cars, but I don't trust them which is sad.
