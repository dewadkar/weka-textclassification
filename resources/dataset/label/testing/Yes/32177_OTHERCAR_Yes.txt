            I am the owner of a 1999 base Cavalier, two door sedan.  This is my second Cavailer...and probably not my last.  My first was a new 1983 and with several other kinds in between, I came back to the Cavalier.  It is dependable, reliable, good on gas, easy to drive and the dealer perks such as life time oil changes, tire rotations all included in the extended warranty...are great.  The only thing I would change would be to get a model that is fully loaded.  I miss some of the immenities.<br><br>
