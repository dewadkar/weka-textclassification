            I bought a 1999 Chevy Prizm last year. It was slightly used but in excellent condition.Prior to that I owned two vehicles but I was always playing mechanic on the weekend. Since I bought my Prizm, I've only checked the oil. I love everything about this car. My family consists of two adults and three children and we all fit quite comfortably. This is an excellent inexpensive and very reliable vehicle. I highly recommend this vehicle to families, students, retirees. I think it goes without saying that this is of course not for off road driving. It is very good on gas mileage also.<br><br>
