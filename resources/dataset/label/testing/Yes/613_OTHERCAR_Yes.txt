            In this review I am talking about the automatic GXE model, which is their highest model. It comes fully loaded with power everything and cruise control. I bought it used in 2000 and owned it for almost a year. I sold it because I moved. During that year I drove it every single day and got a pretty good feel for the car. 

I bought the car at a used car dealer. While test-driving it, I noticed a slight noise in the rear brakes - the salesman obviously denied it - but I made sure it was put in the contract that noise would be fixed before I took the car. Thank God for that! 

When I got the car it was driving fine but after a few weeks I noticed the noise again. They told me that the problem was with the right or left rear brake drum (canï¿½t remember) and that it was slipping. They fixed it once again (for free since it was in the contract). This problem kept reoccurring in all the time that I owned the car. I must have taken it in at least 4-5 times. While this problem didn't affect the driving of the car, it got annoying. Taking the car in so often was even more annoying. I'd bought the car from a dealer because I'd wanted to avoid just such hassles. 
  
The reason I'm telling you this story is that I later learned that this is a common problem in many 1996 Nissan Sentras (not all have it, but you should definitely check yours out before buying). Also, I finally got this information from a used car consumer guide so I would definitely recommend spending a few bucks to check out all the specifics of any car you decide to buy.

Well, that was the warning bit. Other than that problem, I was quite happy with the car. It was great value for money (I wanted a Honda but could only get a 1992 for the same price) and it drove smoothly even with a high mileage (97K when I got it). I never had a problem with any of the electrics and I think the car has a pretty nice look for a 1996 model. It is quite roomy in the front, but the back is a little tight. Since we were usually two people in the car this was not a problem, but I wouldn't recommend it for families unless they have young children who don't require much space. The trunk room was similar to most compact cars. The rear seats fold down to give more space if needed. The interior of the car is very nice and comfortable. I was very impressed with what I got for my $. It gave pretty good gas mileage too. I have to admit, I did have a complaint with the placement of the cup holders - they are right in front of the stereo and block the controls when there is a cup inside them. The other thing is that it is a little sluggish going uphill, so you might want to consider that if you live in a hilly area.

Overall, I think this car is good value for money. Just make sure that the rear brake drums and electrics are okay before you buy the car. I'd also recommend checking a consumer guide for other problems to look for.
