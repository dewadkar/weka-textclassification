            I got my 4Runner after friend of my had purchased one. He had had an older one but it got totaled in an accident, so he purchase a 2003. The day I first saw it was like love a first sight, so I had to get one.

The new 2003 4Runner has lot more interior room. Three people can comfortable fit in the back seat. Even the middle seat has a 3 point seat belt.

I've already taken this thing off-road quite a few times and am really amazed by how smooth the ride is. On road, it corners like car and with the full-time 4wd, you always feel glued to road even in the snow or rain.

The powerful V8 (235HP) may not have same horsepower as the V6 (245HP), but it makes up for it with the additional torque. The other great thing about the V8 is that it comes with a 5 speed transmissions as opposed to the 4 speed of the V6. It test drove both, and the V6 made a bit of whining sound at highway cruising speeds. For 1 MPG less, the V8 is definitely the way to go.

This vehicle is one of the best put together vehicles I've ever owned. All of the pieces fit flush and tight. Toyota has done a really great job on the design and build.

There's plenty of cargo space. The only problem with it is the carpet they used for it. Just about anything you put on it will slide all over the place while driving. I ended up buying a rubber cargo mat for it, for like $70. It looks sharp and keeps if from getting dirt on it as well. Now things don't slide when you go around corners.

The instrument panel is neatly designed, but the gauges are set so deep in the panel that during day driving with sunglasses is makes it a little hard to read (too dark). This is a real anal retentive point, but it's just about the only thing wrong with it.

The sound system is pretty good. Like most stock sound system, it lacks a good bass response. I do love the in dash 6-Disc changer, no need to go to the trunk to change discs. It's has the ability to play two different things at once. If you purchase the wireless headphones for the system, an other person in the vehicle can listen to the radio if you're listening to a CD or vice versa.

The only other gripe I had about it is that I would have liked to have purchased leather seats, but the were not an option on the Sport model. It's only available in the Limited.
