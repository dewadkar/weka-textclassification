            Bought mine in 1995 brand new and loved it ever since.  It's a dependable light weight truck.  Light weight is right it small and nice but I think it could have been equipped with a bigger engine than the 2.2 4 cyl, and the V-6.  I think a mild 350 with a sport suspension package underneath is what the S-10 needs.  Don't get me wrong I love my little truck but as soon as I get a chance that 4 cyl is coming out.  It has plenty of room for a single guy, and with some after market add ons it has got to be the best looking sport truck out there.  In the time I have owned my truck the only things that I have had to replace is the tires and brakes. I would recommend the purchase of an S-10 to somebody in need of excitement, pleasure and a dependable vehicle with a sporty look<br><br>
