            I first noticed that Toyota had redesigned the Celica from their commercials.  The commercial makes it seem as though the Celica is more sporty and a lot faster.  The commercial shows the car speeding along a highway while airplanes fly in unison behind the car.  While the car is somwhat fast, it should not be considered a sportscar by any strech of the imagination.

The new 2000 Celica comes in two models: The GT and the GT-S.  The engine size for both of them isn't terrible although the more expensive GT-S does have noticibly more power.  The GT comes with a four cylinder, 1.8 liter, 140 hp engine.  The GT-S comes with a four cylinder, 1.8 liter, 180 hp engine.  The 40 more hp with the GT-S does make a difference when driving.  The GT-S also comes with a six speed compared to the five speed in the GT.

There are other differences between the GT and GT-S.  The GT is a basic model.  The GT-S comes with a lot of extras.  The interior is all leather.  There are electric windows and moonroof.  The wheels are a bit larger on the GT-S and come with 5 star rims which look really nice.  The rear spoiler also adds a nice touch to the car.

The ride is very nice.  The suspension makes the road less bumpy.  The inside of the car is quiet compared to similar cars.  The handeling is reponsive and tight.

The price is also a major difference between the GT and the GT-S.  The GT starts at about $18,000 while the GT-S starts at about $24,000.  This is considerably more, but the extras, especially the power, is very nice.

Since this is a new model, there is not more information out about the reliability.  Other Toyota models, along with the older Celicas are know for their high quality.  Year after year they are rated one of the most reliable cars by Consumer Reports magazine.  There is no reason why the new Celicas shouldn't follow the old Toyota's quality standards.

Overall the new 2000 Celicas are a great car.  The people at Toyota did a nice job redesigning the outside of the car to keep up with the times.  Although not a sportscar, the Celicas speed is impressive and makes the car fun to drive.<br><br>
