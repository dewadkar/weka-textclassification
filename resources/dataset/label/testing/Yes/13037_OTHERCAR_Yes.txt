            My Grandma brought her the 2000 S80 for 37000.  I have driven the car and i have to say that it is a really good car.  If you live in places like Minnesota, or other places that get a lot of snow then you will love it.  I say this because it has some of the best brakes i have ever seen on a car.  You can also put it in winter mode so it makes it easy on you when driving in snow.  
It also has 6 air bags, 4 for the driver and the front seat passenger, and 2 for the back seat passengers.  It also has day time running lights and all kinds of other things.  But what i like most about the car is it looks lovely and has lots of trunk space.  To tell you the truth I can go on for ever about the car but I'm not so you should take it for a test drive some day.<br><br>
