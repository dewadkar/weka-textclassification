            Of course you should rent this car for a special occasion.  It makes a 
very elegant and glamorous impression.  It is extremely luxurious. I think it looks somehow more majestic and regal than the Mercedes or Cadillac.  It is very dignified and comfortable when you are renting it, but the  question is:  would you actually buy it?

If you have an extra $38,000.00 - $40,000.00, in which case I envy you,  I think there are more reliable and technological superior cars in this class to think about.  The Toyota Avalon has just as plush inside styling, although not as elegant outside styling, plus you are getting Toyota's legendary reliability and technological superiority if you bought an Avalon.

I've driven twice in Lexus models and I was shocked at how quiet they are.  I didn't even know it, but these Lexuses were 1994 and 1995 models.  You could have fooled me.  If 1994 and 1995 are that quiet, I can only imagine what the current model is like.  I think buying a current Lexus is a better use of this amount of money than buying a Town Car.  Lexus also has Toyota reliability since Toyota owns the Lexus brand.  And, Lexus holds its value far better.  I was fooled into thinking a 1994 Lexus was brand new and probably would have paid current prices for it had I not known---if I were in the market for a luxury car.

Whereas, the Lincoln Town Car went through tons of changes between 1995 and 2000.  Making any older Town Cars completely obsolete.  Which is why many people lease a Town Car and trade it in year after year for the current model Town Car, which I say is a hassle.  I grow very attached to my specific cars that I own in the present and I don't want to have to be constantly returning them, even after 3-4 years to a leasing company.

Please read my review, last May-June, of the Lincoln Town Car.  Upon renting the 2001 Town Car, there have not been that many changes from the 2000 to the 2001.  Actually, I don't think there were any changes period.  Lincoln didn't take my advice and make the cup holders deeper and bigger for larger cups and water bottles.  They didn't take my advice and put a CD player in as standard, at least not in the Signature trimline, anyway.

The climate control is lovely.  But it still only goes down to 60 degrees. You might be thinking that 60 degrees is plenty cool, especially at this time of year.  It's fine for now, but in the Summer, when you want to initially cool down a hot car thats been sitting in the hot sun---60 degrees won't cool a car this large down immediately in 100 degree temperatures.

I think the most interesting thing about the Lincoln Town Car is its body-on-frame construction.  This is how all the old style-classic luxury cars were made at one time, and that's what makes the Town Car so classic. I, for one can tell the difference between a car that has this body molded to frame construction, versus a unitized body that's constructed as  all-in-one.  I think cars that have this body-on-frame construction give you a better ride and they float over bumps like a pillow.  Whereas, with a unitized body, the ride is more choppy.  It doesn't matter because all cars are made with a unitized body today.

But this is what makes the Lincoln Town Car such a classic, elegant ride. It's a very dignified, classically elegant car for special occasions.  I'm just not sure I would actually buy it and be stuck with it permanently for everyday use.
