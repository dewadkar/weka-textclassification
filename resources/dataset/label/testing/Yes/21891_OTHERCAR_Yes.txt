            Nothing compares to a BMW!  It is as they advertise... The ULTIMATE Driving machine.  I had a 325, then they let me drive a 528 for a week during a warranty fix.  I was sold!

It has everything you need.  It isn't as expensive or costly to operate as it's larger engine sister, the 540, which is an outstanding vehicle and offers superior joy.  I have recently been in a situation where the acceleration and handling helped save me from an otherwise unpleasant fate.  I can not thank the engineers in Germany enough for that.  I got it fairly loaded (not that BMW offers anything but loaded, the options are real luxuries)

The service I receive from my local dealer has brought me back for this second BMW.  My dealer, Otto's in S.E. PA, does everything they can to make sure that I leave satisfied, even on the regular oil change.

Although I have a 2000 and have not needed a service visit, my history with the BMW line tells me that it won't be a problem.
It is an extremely comfortable car for front passengers and just fine for rear passengers.  If you really need to cart around several people on a regular basis, try the 740 if it's worth the extra money.

Treat yourself.
