            I've had the Olympus D-600L, then a Fuji MX-700 (which is smaller but the pictures are not as good), and finally, an Olympus C-2000 Z.

-------------------------
What I like about the Olympus C-2000Z:
-------------------------

* Olympus digital cameras are known for phenomenal image quality and this camera is yet another proof point. Except for red, these images are hard to distinguish from my (much more expensive) Kodak. 

* I usually shoot in 1024 x 768 mode and get 156 pictures for each 32Mb SmartMedia card. My prints are indistinguishable from film, even by a professional (without a magnifying glass). 

* Cost is super low once you buy the camera and a CD-R recorder like the HP. Since HQ pictures are 250Kb or less in size so you can put 2400 images on a CD-ROM for just $2. So with an effective marginal cost of less than 1/10 of a cent per shot, you can take a LOT of high resolution shots for next to nothing and store it for 100 years without degradation. 
You can't beat that. The low cost means you can take more photos. 
Easy to archive/organize photos. You'll never misplace/lose a photo again. 

* You'll never scratch a negative again! Digital photos are unlikely to be damaged. I save out two copies to CD-ROM discs. At $2 for a CD-R disk, you can't beat that. So even if a CD is damaged or destroyed, I still have multiple backup CDs. 

* You only have to spend money if you want to print a photo. And printing is cheap. You can print for about 50 cents in ink and 50 cents for photo quality glossy paper. $1 for an 8 x 10 isn't bad! 

* You can digitally fix the photo easily (like the Adobe Photo Deluxe Instant Fix feature) before printing. 

* Get the accessory kit with Olympus NiMH batteries and charger. Normal batteries won't last very long in this camera (about 50 shots), but these batteries seem to last forever. 

* The Olympus NiMH charger is really compact; great for travel, but the plastic door hinge is pretty flakey and lots of people have had it break off (including me). 

* A 32Mb memory card is available. Get that and the PCMCIA adapter (mine is a Microtech Digital FlashFilm). This let's me download from the camera to my laptop when I go on vacation. Note: The PCMCIA card will only be seen by your computer after the memory card is inserted. If you insert the card upside down, it won't work and you'll wonder why. Try inserting the card upside down if this happens. 

* Screen on the back allows you to see your pictures immediately. My kids go nuts over this. This is reason alone to get a digital camera. Plus, it allows you to get rid of pictures you don't like, minimizing the amount of times you have to download the camera. 

* No true through the lens view, but it seems close enough! 

* Very compact size, but not quite pocket size 

* 3X motorized zoom; built in flash; macro focus 

* You can see a slide show of your pictures immediately after transferring to computer 

* No more trips to the photo store 

* You save money and time 

* Very easy to delete the last shot you took 

* The effective &quot;speed&quot; of camera is pretty fast, like ISO 100 and F2. That makes it possible to shoot in a lot of cases without a flash. 

* Fast &quot;recover time&quot; between shots (especially in the 1024 x 768 mode) 
You can zoom to 1:1 on the image on the view screen, so you can tell if the picture you captured is really in focus or not. 


-------------------------
Dislikes:
-------------------------

* The lens cap tends to come off too easily. Either make it a secure spring lock, or provide an attachment like the Sony camcorder so that it hangs down from the camera when it is off .

* Need a quick way to switch flash modes. I often want to do this quickly and it is relatively cumbersome (you must bring up a menu). I'd like it on a button. 

* You need to close it down a stop when shooting close-ups with the flash to get the right exposure 

* If you have a tripod and want to shoot at night, you are out of luck. No manual shutter, but this has not been a problem. 

* It isn't cheap at $1200.
