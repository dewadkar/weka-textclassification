            The Olympus D-600L is a great and easy to use camera!  It has reasonable price with a lot of useful and well designed features; it has a built in zoom, a SLR viewfinder and a 3x optical zoom lens.  The maximum resolution of this camera is 1.4 megapixels; the manufacturer's suggested retail price is approximately $420 and it well deserved.  This digital camera is rugged and sturdy but the camera controls are similar to other high quality cameras.

The only disadvantage is a minor one; you have to install software on your computer to retrieve the images from the camera.  While this isn't a major problem, it would be nice if this camera along with the others in its category could store pictures on floppy disks like the Sony Mavica series.  

In summary, this is a great camera and a good buy!<br><br>
