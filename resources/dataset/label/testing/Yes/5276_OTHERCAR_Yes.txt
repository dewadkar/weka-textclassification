            When my 1990 Grand Prix's transmission went out, to the tune of $1500, I decided to buy a new car. I asked many other people what they thought about their cars, and everyone liked their Accords and Camrys. I also checked out the Maxima and Altima.

We found the Accord to be the best overall. The Camry was the smoothest and had a quieter ride, but the power was lacking, and rear seat headroom was a problem. The Maxima was too expensive, the Altima was too noisy. It was down to the Honda and Toyota. The Honda won when all was considered.

We bought the basic LX, which had all the options we wanted. Power windows and locks, air conditioning, automatic, AM/FM cassette, remote mirrors &amp; trunk release, etc. The 150HP 4 cylinder has enough power to change my mind about needing the V6. The ride is relatively smooth and quiet, and the handling is very good. Mileage at 75-78 mph is about 26-27, but cut it down to 67-70 mph and it gets right at 30 mpg. The A/C works great in 105+ degree weather, as does everything else in the car. Controls are convenient and easy to use. I also like the double A/B trip odometer that also shows total miles at the same time.

The only mechanical problem I have had was at 20,000 miles with the emission control system. I had it in to the dealer 4 times about the problem. It would hesitate and jerk a couple times immediately after fueling, and then run fine for about 100 miles. At that point the check engine light would come on. It turned out to be a device in the gas tank (ORVR?) that caused the vacuum canister to suck raw fuel after filling the tank. The dealer was very helpful in trying to solve the problem. They installed a new vacuum canister, computer, and other parts, as well as contacting the Honda factory service center. They provided me with a rental car while my car was in the shop. I filed a claim under the California Lemon Law that Honda denied. During arbitration they offered to extend the bumper-to-bumper warranty to 6 years/70,000 miles, which I accepted. I have had no problems since.

For the combination of power, mileage, comfort, roominess, reliability, handling, and much more, I would recommend looking at a Honda Accord.
