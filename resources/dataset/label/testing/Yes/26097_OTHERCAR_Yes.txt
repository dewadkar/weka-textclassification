            After careful research using the epinions of members, and also using Epinions buying guides, I chose the Epson 750Z digital camera to purchase. Making my decision was no easy task, I spent over a week reading and reading and trying to decide which camera to purchase.

I am happy to say I was not disappointed with my choice!

Here are the features of this camera:

Resolutions up to 1280 x 960 and using hypict mode up to 1600 x 1200
3x true optical zoom
4mb internal flash memory, and 8mb Lexar Media Compactflash card
2inch LCD screen
Macro, digitalzoom, panorama, continuous &amp; quick shot modes
Built in flash w/a slow synchronized mode for night photography
Automatic shut off to save batteries
Video output for playing your pictures back on a TV,VCR or projector
Automatic date &amp; time recording for each picture

When you purchase the camera it comes with a camera case, rechargeable batteries, and the recharger.  It also comes with the PhotoPC 750Z software suite.  

Now for my epinion on this camera.  First let me say I was a novice with digital cameras.  I had never owned one, and knew nothing about them.  I have had great success with the camera so far.  

The pictures I have taken are great, and once I purchased a new printer (you can read my epinion on that HP932)  my pictures when printed out were outstanding quality. My friends were amazed and thought they were pictures taken from a standard camera.  The colors were very true to life.

The life of the batteries so far has been very good.  I have used it several times before having to recharge the batteries.  I have heard that other cameras eat up the batteries, but this is not true with this one.  It only takes about 2 hours to recharge the batteries.

The pictures are downloaded on to the computer through your parallel port. It is very simple to do, but can be slow.  This really doesn't bother me though, I just go over to surfing on the internet while the pictures download. 

With the software included you can go in and correct your pictures.  I am still working with this feature to learn how to do it better. You can make them brighter, sharper, correct the color and more.

I have not used all the features yet, will have to read up on all of them.
But it is very simple to use, and basically very self explanatory.

The only problem that I have had was when I was at my son's basketball game and I was trying to take action shots.  Some of the moving shots of my son came out blurry where they were running up and down the court.

I would highly recommend this camera and am very pleased with my purchase. If you go through dealtime.com you can find a great price comparison on the camera.
