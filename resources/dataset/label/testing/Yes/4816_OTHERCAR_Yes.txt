            The 1992 Sonoma has been a pretty good truck overall.  The good parts to out number the bad ones.  For example, the air conditioner works really well.  It has a decent amount of power for a little 6 as well.  My model does have a bad coat of paint on it.  This is because the truck was made during GM's paint problem years.  Because of the paint job, there is a lot of rust on the truck.  This is because I am unable to wash the salt off of the body.  Another problem with the truck are some of the plastic parts.  So far, the drivers side door arm has cracked, and the plastic in the fan speed have cracked off.  The only other problem I have had with it is the heater core.  I've had to replace it 3 times since I've owned it.  My friend, who works for GM electronics support, has told me this is because there is an electric current that runs through the coolant system, which corrodes the heater core.  It is easily fixed though.  Overall, this truck has been pretty good.
