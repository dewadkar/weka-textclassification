            The 1997 Cavalier is a great choice for those wanting spiffy ride at a small price. I have found my Cavalier to be both adequate in gas mileage and performance. The interior is quite spacious for 2 and can hold 4 on moderate excursions. The construction inside the car is visually appealing and functional. I have a pretty stripped down model and still find it to be more enough to fulfill my needs.

The only drawbacks I have to offer you are that it can be a noisy and stiff ride. I happen to have a great stereo system  so the noise doesn't bother me as much. The stiff ride can cause some rattles in the interior and exterior of the car , but the dealer was quick to remedy these problems in a short amount of time. For a used car , purchased in 1999, the 1997 Cavalier is a great choice for a great price. 

Stay away from the Doge Neon!! Just trust me! <br>
