               When we decided to purchase a new truck we looked at just about every small truck manufactured.  We were not satisfied with any of them.  The Chevy S10 was ok but was to small for our upcoming family and it had no power.  The Ford Ranger was cheaply made and it did not run very smooth.  Toyota Tundra is supposed to be full size but the Dodge Dakota was much bigger.  
   So after looking and looking and not finding what we wanted, we looked at the Dodge Dakota.  Wow, what a truck.  It ran smooth, it had a powerful engine, was big enough for a family(it even fits a car seat in the back), very few discrepancies such as such as parts being replaced.    
   In conclusion we decided on the Dakota over all others.  We bought our 1998 Dodge Dakota Extend Cab brand new.  It is fully loaded, 4 wheel drive, extended cab, V8, 318ci, just about everything you could get, we got it.  It has definitely been the best truck.  We were Ford lovers until this truck came along.  <br><br>
