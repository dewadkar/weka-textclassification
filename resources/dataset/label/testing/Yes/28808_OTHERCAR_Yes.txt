            <b>Kodak DC-210 Plus</b>

I've had the Kodak DC-210 megapixel camera for about a year now and I love it.  

The first thing you notice about this camera is that it has a sleek, yet heavy-duty looking design.  And then when you pick up the camera, the next thing you notice is that its a lot lighter then you might expect, and thats great for when you just want to toss it into your pocket and head outside and shoot some photos.

The photos that are taken with the DC-210 are generally very high quality but not quite on par with a professional camera.   But hey, for the price I'm not complaining!

Something that I really like about this camera is its ease-of-use.  This camera has plenty of features to keep an expert interested, but it has intuitive design and it is easy to learn so it is also great for people not used to using digital cameras.  

<b>Number of photos per memory card:</b> Depending on how your DC-210 comes equipped (which package you choose) you will get either a 4 MB storage card, or an 8 MB storage card.  Mine came with an 8 meg, and when I set the camera to taking its highest quality pictures you only get about 30 shots per memory card.  But then when you set the camera to its lowest picture quality setting, which is still quite decent, I can get 120 photos per memory card.  As mentioned, the numbers quoted are for the 8 MB card, just cut the number of shots in half for the 4 MB memory card.

The DC-210 operates on 4 AA batteries and battery life can be quite substantial.  <b>Battery Saving Tip:</b> Go into camera preferences, and turn off the instant preview on the LCD right after you take a picture.  Disabling this feature can add literally <i>hours</i> to your battery life.  Also, generally try not to use the LCD too much, because that does kill battery life.

<b>Big Tip:</b> For an extra $50 you can get the USB version of this camera.  <b>It is worth every single penny!</b>  My version is the serial connection, which is incredibly slow for transfering pictures.  Its the kind of setup where you decide you want to transfer into your computer 20 shots, and then you go take a nap, and if youre lucky it will be done by the time you wake up.  I have a friend who has the USB model, and it makes a night and day difference in speed transfers, he only has to wait a couple of seconds.  And just FYI, the DC-210 comes equipped with a built in infrared transmitter, so if you have a computer that is set up for infrared communications (usually all laptops are),  you have a slightly faster communication method then the serial cable.

<b>Summary:</b> All in all, my experience with the DC-210 model leaves me very satisfied that my money was well spent.  I also appreciate that the camera is coming from a big name in photography, whereas I might feel less secure with my purchase if it was a no-name camera.  I highly recommend this camera for all recreational users of digital cameras.  By that, I mean that unless you are interested in SLR professional level photography, this is a super camera.  So, if you're in the buying market for a digital camera, place this one high up on your list of potentials...
