Where have all the sporty cars gone?  If you like the looks, feel, and power of a sporty vehicle in a package bigger than a bread box or boxter but smaller than a pickup or SUV your choices are becoming increasingly slim.

Let me save you some money -- forget about the Mustang and Mitsubishi Eclipse and go directly to Cougar -- do not pass go.

The Cougar has an extremely slick and sexy look at a price significantly lower than its competitors.  With the Sports and Convenience packages, it has the oomph and options to back-up its bad looks.

If you can, choose the leather seating -- it makes a difference.  Also, you might want to forego the factory moonroof for a more functional after-market sunroof.

While the Cougar displays significant strength when it opens up, it does open up slowly.  It's got power,  but lacks something in the turbo department.

Nonethelss, if you want a hot car at a great price and aren't looking to burn rubber to impress teenage boys, this is your car!
