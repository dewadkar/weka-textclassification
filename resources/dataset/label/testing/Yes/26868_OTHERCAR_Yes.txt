            Back in 1987 I purchased the first version of this car, the Ford Taurus, which was a good, reliable family sedan.  The 2001 Sable LS Premium was leased new in December 2000.  My initial impression was one of familiarity with the Taurus, but the current version has come a long way.

The handling is top notch with no tire squeal on turns taken at a healthy speed.  The ride is comfortable over rough city streets with or without a full load.  On the highway, the car tracks straight and true and there is a minor amount of wind noise entering into the cabin.  The trunk is huge and very deep with plenty of room.  The trunk held just about everything my daughter needed for her first year away at college this past August (thankfully, it also has a cavernous rear seat!).  The 200 horse power engine proved capable of any situation and provides terrific acceleration, using regular fuel.  The engine is very quiet at cruising speeds.  Fuel economy has averaged close to 30 MPG on the highway and 22 MPG in the city.

The car has a huge list of amenities which were standard in this trim line.  Along with the usual power windows and locks, the car included a power moon roof, adjustable pedals (great when there are big differences in height between drivers), leather seats, electronic temperature control, heated side view mirrors, auto on headlights, and power seats.

The standard sound system sounds great, but I had to add the 6 CD-changer installed in the trunk.  I would have preferred a single CD player in the dash allowing for a larger cache of accessible discs nearby.  The radio reception is quite good and a cassette player is included.  The power seats are very comfortable with a huge range of adjustment and, along with the adjustable pedals, it is very easy to find a comfortable driving position.  The large windows give a great view all around the car.

My Sable has almost 11,000 miles on the odometer.  The car has proven very reliable with no needed visits back to the dealer.

My wife drives twice weekly in a car pool with three other passengers in a ride that lasts an hour; everyone is very comfortable even when traffic is congested and the ride takes longer than usual.

This car was leased for $320/month with a down payment of $680 for 36 months/36,000 miles.  I would recommend the Mercury Sable LS Premium to anyone requiring a family sedan with room to spare.  All the extras this car came with has probably spoiled me.  My next vehicle must have them all, at a minimum!  This is definitely a lot of car for the money.
