            I'm looking for the biggest bang for my little buck...I only bought a new vehicle because i'd had some bad experiences w/ my last 2 used ones. This little bugger was the cheapest, most highly rated vehicle on the market when i bought it and it drives SMOOOOOOOTH. 

Here's what I like: Hey, it was a great price - I bought it free &amp; clear for UNDER $15K (1997) w/ bucket seats and a bed-liner. With a bed cover (another $1,000) it gets great gas mileage. It's a mid-size truck, not one of those punies where you feel like you're really in a CAR w/ a bed in the back...I've got bucket seats and the comfort of a car in the cab. It's a smooth ride (manual trans) and handles like a car. I drove up &amp; down the CA coast looking for my next life to live &amp;  haven't had ANY real problems (it's nearly 3 years old)--I liked it enough w/ it to ship it all the way out here (Honolulu) from California and THAT's a used car price in shipping alone!! And I like having the space to cart things around - i've moved so much and I have enough toys to warrant having a pickup. No leaning on friends... no 'limo service' for anyone else either w/ my standard cab.

What I don't like: Mine's only 2WD...and it's not too strong. The back end (typical) is WAY light and fishtails on dirt roads unless I sandbag it. The only other negative is that everyone &amp; their grandmom's got one of these suckers out here in HI--way to fit in!<br><br>
