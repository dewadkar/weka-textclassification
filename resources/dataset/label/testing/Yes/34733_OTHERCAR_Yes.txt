              My search for a vehicle had finally ended after driving a Passat. I drove nearly everything imaginable from BMW 325's to Z-28 Camaros to S.U.V.'s you name it and I probably test drove it, but there was always something lacking whether it be quality, price, or comfort until a friend of mine whom happens to work at a local VW dealership informed me of a 1997 Passat GLX that they had for sale, being a previous VW owner (1996 VW Jetta which was stolen and a 1968 Bug)I was very interested since I was already aware of VW outstanding quality. After taking the car for a drive I knew that I had to have it. The quality of the car is equal to that of the BMW's but for a fraction of the price. The car has the look and the features of a much more expensive car. My car came with power windows and locks (which are standard on Passats)leather interior, automatic, moonroof, and etc, etc. To find features equal to mine in any other European car you would be spending into the mid $20,000's at least.
                        LET'S GO FOR A DRIVE
  Once you slide yourself into this car you will know that you have found quality the seats are extremely comfortable and they adjust into many various positions such as height,tilt,recline, and lumbar you will always be able to find a position that is right for you. The VR6 is a truly amazing engine it is not a V6 but it is also not an inline 6 it almost is but not quite. The horse power is 172 but many believe that this is under rated, after driving it I would have to agree. The car accelerates rather quick for a car of it size, it has the torque of an inline 6 it makes power at any rpm and let me tell you it loves the freeway. I am only 23 years old so am still stupid when it comes to speed, but you want to know every thing about this car so here it is. You won't lose to many races on the freeway the top end on this car is crazy. I have beaten everything from raced out Hondas to CHP's. The day I bought my car I wanted to see how it ran so on the way home I gassed it a little, I saw a car coming up fast I thought that it wanted to race so I floored it I started to lose him I thought that I had won, WRONG the person I raced was a highway patrol that was pacing me at 125 MPH (big ticket) actually I was up to 132 MPH and still pulling fairly strong. 
    Back to the important stuff the car rides great, it is very quite inside with plenty of room for 4 adults. I recently drove 1000 miles round trip with 4 large adults comfortably. Gas mileage in town is about 19 to 21 mpg and about 25 to 28 on the freeway. 
    The also has cool little features like M.F.A. which is a digital readout near the gauges that displays engine temp, elapsed time, gas mileage, average speed, and outside temp. Another great feature is the factory alarm when you lock the door it automatically locks all of the doors and if you hold the key in the locked position it will roll up all of the windows and shut the sunroof, and vice versa if you unlock the door and hold it rolls all of the windows down just in case you wanted to air out the car before getting in on a hot day, all four windows are one touch down which means if you push the down button for more than one second it automatically rolls down all of the way.
                   PEOPLE THAT SHOULD OWN THIS CAR
     Anybody with a family large or small will appreciate this car or if you are like me and want a nice respectable, classy car that you car haul friends in and if you are tired of seeing Honda's and Acura's (to all of the import racers Acura's are still Honda's no matter how hard you try) with exhaust that sound like a swarm of bee's chasing you. 

     Sure I will own other cars in my lifetime but there will always be a least one Volkswagen in my garage.
