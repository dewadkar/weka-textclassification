            &#147The Little Camera That Could&#148

I am impressed and very excited about a new digital camera from Hewlett-Packard.

Hewlett-Packard has finally manufactured a mature digital camera with all the bells and buzzers.  Maybe a few too many.  I find the audio/video feature a distraction to the process of photography.  The new HP 935 is a dandy of camera with all the quality features of simplicity(user-friendliness) of use we come to expect of a HP product along with some &#147expert&#148 features this time.

No longer do fans of HP have to rely on the limited settings offered with their previous fare.  This new model offers all the manual settings that any professional has come to rely on to take the best picture for all environs (indoor/outdoors, night and day).  The HP935&#146s controls can still be set automatically for the  shutter bug who hasn&#146t yet mastered all the manual settings or just wants to take a quick shot and go for broke.  But, for the adventurous, we now have the creative control to get &#147just&#148 the picture we want.  And isn&#146t that why you want a <b>digital</b> camera:  <b>creativity and creative control</b>.

HP has been in the digital camera business for many years now and have produced some fairly decent models in the past (see my review).  I come to expect and get the quality associated with the Hewlett-Packard name.  The HP 935 is no exception albeit that you are getting, in my estimation, the sum total of the successes gained and lesson learned from previous lines in what I believe has finally epitomize what most digital camera enthusiast will want and need for their purchase.

HP will always offer what I feel are three distinct levels in their line of digital cameras:

<b>Level one</b>

Those of the entry-level photographer, will provide a satisfactory user experience with modest resolution.  These camera&#146s will have just the most minimal user control for the sake of ease of use and will be fine for web-sharing and perhaps 3&#148 X 5&#148 printouts.  <b>Important</b>Keep in mind the limitations when purchasing.  Benefits:  Cost and simplicity of use.

<b>Level two</b>

This level of the genre is designed for those who want a little more from their digital camera.  At this level, the buyer is beginning to consider specific features he wants from his digital experience.  Perhaps, resolution begins to creep into your purchase criteria or you want an option to make downloading to your computer easier.  Your will begin to find some advanced features at this level.  Benefits:  Again, ease of use, but you will notice a significant increase in the cost. More control over the digital experience and your photo results.  Better  quality with higher resolution.  More features.  You can see that the benefits can offset the increase in cost, but weigh this factor diligently to avoid disappointments.



The final level is reserved for the professional who wants the best in his digital camera and the most satisfaction in his digital experience.  She may also be an amateur who has whisked through the previous levels or perhaps is just using a little foresight into what her demands for digital photography might be or become.  It is this final level I will dwell on since it relates to those buyers who might be interested in the new <b> HP935</b>.

My friends, hear me well when I discuss this camera and it&#146s benefits.  Listen to the voice of one who has been through the above progression of levels.  If all the &#147bells and buzzers&#148 are not important to you, then I can only recommend this camera on the grounds it&#146s high resolution and HP reliability.  It boasts a 5.3  MP(mega pixel) resolution.  HP claims that you will be able to print high-quality 20&#148 X 30&#148 pictures with this camera.  Realistically, I would put that at 8&#148 X 10,&#148 but for most of us, we would hardly notice the increase or decrease in quality between the two formats.

Resolution is almost the single most important specification you want when purchasing a digital camera and HP&#146s 935  and Hewlett-Packard now closely rivals it&#146s competitors( notably Canon and Olympus) in that it provides that baseline resolution necessary for most large output printers( i.e., Canon S9000) and gives the user control of it&#146s subject.

Yes, resolution is important, but it isn&#146t the only factor you should use when deciding on your purchase.  The <b>technology</b> used to deliver the image you see in the viewfinder to the small removable memory chip(<b>S</b>ecure <b>D</b>igital) that contains the image data which eventually ends up on your computer as a file, is just as important.  

This is one reason why you want to purchase HP.  They have been in the computer technology  industry for many years and in some cases set the standards(i.e., ink jet printers) for this industry.  Rest assured you can relax knowing that the technology used in their digital cameras is based on years of research and development and kept at the same standard you have come to recognize in all their products.

Ok, resolution is a good starting point, but only that.  It can keep you focused on what you want because as a general rule, the more resolution you find in a digital camera the more features you will find on it and hence the more you will pay.  

Now let&#146s get back to some of the HP&#146s 935&#146s features.  We know it has plenty of resolution to get the job done, but just how good will those pictures look if you don&#146t have specific controls to get the results you want?  What kind of effects are you trying to gain from your digital camera?  Well, the HP 935 can answer some of those questions by providing specific settings and LCD(liquid crystal display) wizards that take you through the steps that tackle the most complicated among them.  

If you are familiar with HP products, you know that HP&#146s prime concern is making the user experience as easy and pain free as possible.  You know that HP will lead you through the steps with user-friendly icons, not sidesteping you with technical jargon or symbols that could possibly throw you off.  The best "online" instruction will combine these two aspects and hence educate the user.  I think HP has succeeded on this level in providing easy navigation through their settings menus yet retaining a professional environment by not oversimplifying.

Aesthetically, the HP935 is a  beautiful and elegantly contained crafted piece of technology.  It&#146s is slimmer and more box like than their previous models, reminiscent of the canon series digital cameras.  You can be assured it&#146s been ergonomically tested to conform to your hand without wearing you out for the day&#146s shooting.  Size dimensions are3.8 x 1.8 x 2.6 in (97 x 45 x 67 mm)/0.56 lb (0.23 kg).

I&#146m not going to go into an exhaustive account of all the technical specifications and features here.  I would recommend visiting HP&#146s web site for that information.  But, I would like to point out some of the more prominent of these and how they could apply to your creative and professional advantage.

ISO(exposure):  You have three setting to control film speed.  Many of you are familiar with this control from you film based cameras.  You used to have to buy a particular speed film for the corresponding setting.  Now, you simply change a setting for indoor, outdoor sun, moving objects and nighttime shots.  Sound easier?  Get creative and buy a good book on digital photography to exploit this and other features.  I recommend &#147iPhoto:  The Missing Manual&#148 for Macintosh users or any O&#146Reilly Publication on the subject for PC/ Windows users.

Memory:  Your HP935 uses 32MB Secure Digital( or similar format MMC).   Slightly more expensive and less durable than the more familiar and popular compact flash, but smaller in physical size.  Also, I don&#146t think SD memory comes in the large capacities(512MB) that CF does.  

Along these lines, when you buy your camera buy more memory as well.  Remember this is a high res camera (5.3MB) is eats up memory (2.6MB/ image) on the highest resolution setting .  This is singularily the best advice I can give you  when purchasing accessories for your camera

Metering:  TTL(automatic adjustment) and spot.  Use this setting to adjust for areas that are in high contrast to each other to get the correct exposure.  Amazingly, in many cases, this adjustment that makes the difference between success and failure of your shot.

White balance:  Here&#146s a feature that nice!  Use this setting to adjust to the particular lighting situation you encounter.   For example, fluorescent vs. natural.  Simply, set your camera to each lighting situation you encounter or let the HP technology once again do it for you.  Experiment and see what works for you.  Keep in mind the warmer and cooler types of light and the shading that each casts.  Again, for goodness sake, get creative!  That&#146s why the controls are there!

Lens:  If resolution and technology are the meat and potatoes of this camera&#146s system, then the HP935&#146s lens is the crown jewel.  This is the tour de force of the system.  Combined with the HP&#146s technology, ease of use and ample resolution, the Pentax lens is critical to complete the digital image capture loop.  For many in the industry, Pentax lens are considered the creme ala creme of lens.  They are manufactured and ground from glass compared to the inferior although less costly plastic.  The standards set by this Pentax has long been admired by those in the know.  I would recommend visiting HP&#146s and  Pentax&#146s web site for more information and exact specifications.  Suffice to say, with this lens incorporated into your camera's system, you can expect sharper images and more vivid colors as well as more control through HP&#146s unique  implied and applied technology.  3X Optical Zoom(21X digital).

Other standard features:  Flash, Auto Focus/ Exposure, and redeye reduction.

Compatibility:  If you have an updated computer that uses the most recent versions of either platform(Macintosh or PC) then this won&#146t be an issue for you.  But, if you are using an older system then you might want look into this detail.  

You want to make sure your computer has the minimum required memory(64MB/PC,128/MAC), a fast enough processor(PII/PC, 233PPC/MAC), and enough hard disk space available(175MB/PC, 150MB/MAC)  It must also have the appropriate port(USB), CD-ROM and optionally a CD-RW drive.

HP wants to make your user experience as simple as possible so you can get to the business of the day avoiding technology that&#146s suppose to make life simpler in the first place!  HP provides this by carefully documenting everything and anything that makes your installation necessary.  By installation, I mean the software that you must &#147install&#148 on your computer and the connections from your camera to your computer/printer/ dock via USB (universal serial bus) or SD card reader(optional input device).

Software:  I can speak from experience that HP always includes some substantial editing or imaging  software.  The software is intended to integrate with all of their other products in the whole scheme of things.  For instance, the hub being your computer would integrate nicely with the camera as well as a scanner or printer.  This is important to consider if purchasing the entire package now or later.  And I can assure you that the compatibility will be at an optimal level this way.
Also, you  may find that customer support will be a one stop trip in most cases.     

But don&#146t be shy from combining other brands  to tailor your imaging output.  You'll be surprised at how the various manufacturer&#146s are, at this point, working toward industry standardization in this area.  One good example is EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) technology, which HP uses, that ensure color accuracy as well maintaining the integrity of other important information recorded by your camera and sent through various stages of the digital print process(i.e., from computer to printer.)  HP remains on the leading edge in this as well as other technologies to keep you up to date.

Also included in the software bundle is a nifty little program called <b>CD Memories Disk Creator Software</b>.  I&#146ve used this a number of times to record my digital files(photos) to a CD(compact disk).  This becomes useful in a number of ways.  Not the least in providing you with a way to share your photos with family and friends.  With this software, you simply "tell" the software program which photos you want on your disk and it does the rest even prompting you to insert a CD into the drive when it's ready.   When the disk is finalize or burned, you have what is now called a VCD(video compact disk) that will play on most newer model DVD players.  Now, you are beginning to see some of the possibilities.  And, since your files are now saved in reliable storage media you can free up your hard drive space(remember that these image files can be as large as 2.6MB and that can fill up a hard drive pretty durn quickly).  You can also print your pictures from the disk this disk when ever you want.   Essentially, your files are now "archived" for posterity or whatever.

HP now has what it calls &#147Instant Share.&#148  Basically, through it&#146s exclusive software, you can direct where your files will end up when you start downloading them to your computer's hard drive.  This can be done directly via USB or with the optional dock which also serves as a charging unit.

You simply make the proper setting on the camera  and the file will automatically be sent to your e-mail application, particular folder and more!  All, to make your job easier.  Don&#146t think about the technology, just the end product.  HP frees this up for you to become more creative.  Your energy is divested to explore more productive/ creative areas.

With this overview of HP&#146s 935 you are in a better position to determine if the camera is right for you.  I&#146ve discussed some of the features, hinted at the technology, and made some applicable suggestions.  The rest is up to you!  

I wouldn&#146t expect you to go out and buy this camera on just my recommendation.  That would be foolhardy.  But, if you are genuinely interested in digital photography,  do your homework first.  Understand the basics of the technology.  Separate the fact from fiction.  Listen to sound advice. Then, and only then begin shopping.  Hopefully, I had made this job a little easier. 

I  stand by this camera and it&#146s manufacturer and can wholeheartedly recommend it especially for new comers who don&#146t want to drown in detail and technology.

Good Luck in your purchase. Once the hard part of shopping is over and you have your digital photography lab up and running you will see there is no end to the possibilities.

Have fun!
