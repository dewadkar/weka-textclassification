            About 3 weeks ago I purchased an Envoy XL SLT (4/02 build) Monterey Maroon Metallic color with sunroof, heated seats, in dash 6 disk CD radio, 3.73 Rear axle ratio, and 17 inch polished wheels.  Got the 6/60 extended warranty.  Final (pre-tax) price was $33,800 + $1500 for warranty.

I was a little concerned to see the various problems that the original Envoy initially had - but it seems like most of those issues were ironed out by about 2/02 builds.  I'm assuming that they put most of those fixes into the Envoy XL - there are no recalls/TSBs for the XL.  It's almost like the XL is the second year of production in the Envoy line.

So far 750 miles and no problems.  Absolutely loving the SUV - I think that it looks great.  I'm constantly getting compliments on it.  I'm pleased with the power, interior/exterior looks, size and the many, many features.  The size has been wonderful.  Took a trip with 6 people (all seats up) - and still had enough room to put plenty of stuff in the back.  I figure with all 3 seats up (7 passengers), it's still got about a much storage as a standard car trunk.

Stretching to find some negatives: 
a) It barely fits into my garage - kind of a negative (but kind of desired too).  Had to put up one of those strings with a weight to make sure I park it in the correct distance.  About 6 inches left over behind and 1.5 feet left in front (standard sized garage).

b)  Fog lights seem like they point too far down to me - I'd prefer them to beam outwards a little more.

c)  Gas mileage.  16 MPG with mostly city driving and constant AC on.  Better than most SUVs of this size, but still not great.

d)  AC works limitedly until you get moving - but once you're rolling it is good (dual HVAC is nice).

If I had just won the lottery, I think that I'd still end up with an Envoy XL (those Hummers stand out too much).  I would strongly endorse/suggest buying an Envoy XL.
