            Opinions between Honda and Toyota:
I had just purchase this Matrix XR a couple days ago and test drove the Matrix, Corolla, Honda Civic and Accord and came with this conclusion.  See Test Drive Results  

Test Drive Results:
My last 2 car were Honda Accord and I would like to say that I would never buy another Honda.  The ride on the Honda is very bouncy even on the new 2003 Accord.  Toyota has the best riding vehicle all around, even the Matrix rode better then the Civic.  Even though Honda engine are smooth and quiet but when you push the civic harder you will still notice the engine.  I still prefer Toyota.  When I first test drove the Matrix, it was noisy.  But when I went to a different dealer to test drive it again, it wasn't as noisy.  

Conclusion between the earlier built version and the newer built one now:
But what I had figure out is that the first one that I drove was the earlier built one that had come out at the beginning of the year and Toyota might had some complaints about the noise and probably added more insulation on the later models.  

After a couple of days driving the Matrix:
The car was fun to drive and very good on the brakes.  There is enough room for 5 adults.  My kids would prefer to ride in this car than the van when going out.   The car was easy to park.  Even my wife and son said that it drove and handle better than the Honda. 

Exterior:
The car has a higher roof.  The color selections was better than the Hondas.  Honda color selections was bland.  The design of the car is unusual and eye appealing.  

Interior:
There is a height adjustment on the driver side. The interior seat fabric built to last.  Every seat in the car folds down leaving a flat floor surface is plastic making it easy to slide things in or out of the car.  Also there are rails embedded in the plastic so that you can strap down things.  With the front seat folded down you are able to put a laptop there and plug it into the dash 115v outlet.  There are also 2 cigarette lighter.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a small car with lots of room.   There are 2 cup holder in the front and 2 in the back. The instrument panel was not clutter and has a red background lights.  The power door locks when starting the car and it unlocks when you turn the engine off.   I was very impress with the radio that came with the car.  It had am/fm radio with a CD player.  The other options that this car has is the sports plus package (includes color-keyed front and rear underbody spoilers and integrated fog lamps), P205/55R16 tires on 16" aluminum alloy wheels , cruise control, intermittent wipers front and rear, alarm, and the power option (power window, power side mirrors, power locks, auto transmission and 115v aux power outlet, Cargo mat, Carpeted floor mats, Toyota Vehicle Intrusion Protection (VIP), A/C and Rear bumper step cover.

Engine:
The engine is a 1.8L - 130 hp.  33 city / 38 highway.   I thought that the engine had enough power to get me where I needed to go.  It has good acceleration and handles very well going around the curves.  This car has a very good brake feeling.

Conclusion:
This car is a good buy.  The looks of the car outside and the instrument panel inside makes this car very appealing.  The features on this car are great.  A good safe car when driving.
