            I have owned my D-600L for over a year now.
I have been very happy with it's features and, most importantly,
the image quality. Of course there are newer cameras out there
with higher resolution, and other newer features but this is still
a pretty solid camera w/ very good image quality.

My only beefs are:

1) serial cable interface is very slow - I finally bought a flash card reader &amp; that works nicely. The newer cameras have USB which should be nice. No suppor for compact flash so yu can't put a microdrive in it.

2) my camera will only handle 8MB smart media cards - requires an upgrade
to support larger cards - Olympus should have thought of this in advance
and the upgrade should ahve been free. I chose not to upgrade mine.

3) Slow recycle time while it writes to disk - you can't even set up your 
next shot in the meantime i.e. the zoom is frozen 'till it's done writing.

4) eats batteries - I purchased two sets of rechargeable NiCad batteries.

5) poor low-light sensitivity, can't focus in low light. Thankfully there are 2 pre-set focus ranges you can choose.

With all this complaining, I am still a happy camper because the pictures speak for themselves. Great color/quality. Decent ergonomics. True SLR.
