            I just got my 2001 Escape XLT on Nov 9th, it's great I couldn't ask for a better SUV. The engine is quieter than I expected for a V6. Interior is very roomy, and the ride is smooth with it's great leather seats.The Escape is not to small or to big, and getting in and out of parking lots are easy. With the tinted power moon roof, 16in alloy wheels, trailer towing package, MACH audio system/7 speaker with 6 disc cd player with integrated receiver and 4WD in light parchment gold, this my ultimate SUV. 

P.S. The only negative thing I can find about this SUV is, that the cruise control has no illuminated light on the steering wheel when driving at night.<br><br>
