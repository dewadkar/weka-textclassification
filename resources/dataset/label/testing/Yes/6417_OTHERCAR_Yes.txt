            I have been a 1997 Toyota T100 owner for a few months now and I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase!  My truck has a bed liner, running boards and a bug/rock shield.  I have a DX model with Auto transmission, AC, Sliding Rear Window and Cruise.  It has the 3.4 L V6 engine.  

This is a very nice truck, what I like best about it is the size.  When the T100 first came out people were critical of it for not being the real full-size truck that Toyota had promised and they were right.  The T100 is �almost� a full size truck and that is just fine with me.  I didn�t want a full size truck, living in Seattle it would be a real pain to have a really big truck.  

The cab is plenty large and has the potential to seat 6 (although the extra cab is a quite cramped).  The front seats are a split bench style, I like this due to my 6�7� height, it lets me stretch out a bit, unlike the cramped bucket seats.  The extra cab also has a split bench seat.  The extra cab seats fold up to allow access to some nice storage bins underneath.  These bins are nice because they are out of sight and out of the mind of some potential thief.  I use them to store my emergency car supplies like flares, fix-a-flat, jumper cables, etc.  The cab also has nice handles to help you get in.  The front seat also has a nice big soft fold-upable armrest.  There is also a clock that is easy to see.  I have towing package and as such there is an Overdrive-Off button on the end of the column shifter.  The glove box is huge and doesn't get in the way, the passenger side has tons of leg room!

There are some bad things about the cab.  The drink holder is wacky, the passenger side hole is smaller than the drivers-side hole, that seems kind of dumb if you ask me!  The controls are not great either, when you do have the drink holder out it partially blocks the temperature and fan controls.  I don�t know what the Toyota designers where thinking there, I guess they had no where else to put it.  Also the stereo is low and it is difficult to see the screen on it.  The armrest on the doors is awfully hard.  The headrests are not the best either but they are ok.  

On the outside the T100 is a very nice looking truck.  The extra-cab comes with a 6 ft. bed that is a bit shallower than the full sized truck but plenty deep.  There are great hooks on all the corners in the bed for tying things down.  The gas tank has a nice security feature, it comes with a lock on the gas door, you have to use the key to open it.  The running boards are nice to have as well as the bed liner, I recommend them.  

The ride in the T100 is excellent for a big truck, it has independent front suspension and that really helps.  Some reviews say that the T100 is the Camry of trucks and they were right.  All the reviews I have seen rate the T100 high in reliability, this is typical of Toyota quality.  Gas mileage is decent.  The engine could use a little more power but it is not too bad, the pre-1995 T100�s were badly underpowered and I would warn buyer to stay away from them.  They should have made a model with a small V8 but oh well.  

Just a note if you don�t already know but Toyota no longer makes the T100, 1998 was the last year, they replaced it with the Tundra.  Thanks for reading!
