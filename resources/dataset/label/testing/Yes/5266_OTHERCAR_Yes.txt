            I bought my White 2000 Plymouth Breeze in December 01 and have been very pleased.

I was, and still am impressed with the power and torque in that little 4 cyl. DOHC engine.  It runs smooth and has no problems tackling any of the hills or mountains here in Utah.  The mileage isn't wonderful, but hopefully if you are reading this you don't have to deal with oxygenated fuel either.

The styling and lines of the car I think are classic and not too overstated.  The view out of the car is wonderful until you get to the back.  like other Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth products the rear deck is a little high for my liking, but you tend to get used to it.  but this also allows it to have a large trunk, so I think it is an okay trade off.

All the instrumentation is large and easy to read, easy to navigate.  The stereo is of poor quality, so shortly there after I replaced it with a Sony.  the speakers still need help.  Not quite good enough for any audio enthusiasts.

My biggest complaint for this vehicle is the steering wheel.  It tends to be quite noisy when making any distinct turning motions.  Other than that it has been a wonderful car to own.
