            I purchased the a60 after my first two cameras--both old Olympus Camedias--stopped working all of a sudden.  I got a great deal at Best Buy, which included a 128mb CF card (which yields about 125 pics on the a60 in the largest pic size and best resolution--not bad). 

So far, no complaints.  Operation was simple and intuitive, and I loved the movie and manual modes.  The other automatic options were good, too.  I preferred using the fast motion mode, since the relatively low shutter speed caused pics to blur when in AUTO mode.  

But while the normal image quality was fantastic, the low-light pic quality was abysmal.  My 1.3MP Olympus cameras (which were about 7-8 years old when I got them) provided a low-light backlight that gave everything a cool reddish hue while managing to highlight everything important in the composition.  Not so the a60.  Instead, you're left with grainy, shadowy pictures.  You could use the flash, but I wouldn't recommend it: it's way too bright for anything other than an emergency flare.  There may be a way to temper the flash, but I never got the chance to figure it out, because the camera just stopped working.

Now, maybe I'm cursed, since this is exactly what happened with my Camedias, but the other day (after successfully taking several pics), I turned the camera on, the lens extracted from the camera body, and that's it. Nothing on the LCD, no whirring, no clicking, nothing.  Needless to say, I was slightly furious.

The camera is out for repair as I write this.  Best Buy wouldn't take the camera back after 14 days (which is ridiculous), and Canon's only repair center for digital cameras is in Illinois.  Everyone at Canon was very friendly, and they told me it would take 10-15 days for the repair.  We'll see about that ...

After all of this, I would still recommend the camera.  My friend has an a70 (same camera, but 3.2MP), and has never had an issue with it.  I'm going to count my issue as a fluke, unless it happens again, in which case I will no longer deal with Canon.  Best Buy, however, is on my enemy list now, and while they cut me a deal on the camera, I could probably have cut the same deal with any number of megastores and had a month to return the thing.
