            - The PT cruiser instantly caught my attention.  I actually heard about it about six months ago since one of my relatives works for chrysler and he advised us to wait on buying a SUV or minivan.  

- I am still not sure how they fit all the cargo space into a vehicle that is shorter than a NEON.   My wife and I are interested in following the development of this new vehicle.  

- The cruiser in person(?) looks like a dick tracey mobile, but the inside seems very versatile and it can be configured 26 different ways according to the website although this may be an exageration unless you count each seat angle as a configuration

- The four cylinder engine definitely leaves something to be desired and the hope is that they will introduce a six cylinder engine in future models

- Honestly, we haven't driven the vehicle so it would be dishonest of me to tell you about the driving experience although we hope to talk one of the local dealers into letting us test drive it soon.  

- I reccomend this vehicle to those of you in the inbetween life stage between a sports car - minivan - SUV .  It takes all of the pros of each style and adds its own special retro flair.  <br><br>
