            The Avalon is an extremely competent performer. It is very smooth and silent and wafts along as if it were riding on a cloud. It's turbine smooth and silent V6 is a strong and flexible performer and returns very good fuel consumption.  The Avalon feels much smaller than it's dimensions suggest and is a very easy vehicle to drive. It is very predictable and behaves competently in every circumstance. The ABS brakes are powerful and well-modulated, and the steering is light but precise with good road feel.
The air-conditioning unit is a particularly strong performer, bringing the temperature down quickly in the South East summer heat. The interior fittings and furnishings are of Lexus quality, invoking an ambiance of serene, upscale luxury - particularly when optioned with the two-tone ivory leather. The interior is huge - the same size as that of a Mercedes S430 and just 1 cubic foot less than the Lexus LS430.
Nothing has gone wrong or fallen off. It's tight and rattle-free and still feels new.
Despite being an outstanding performer in every aspect, the Avalon is under-promoted and almost invisible in the market.
It's Toyota's best kept secret and is 95% a Lexus LS430 for considerably less money. I should know - I used to have an LS400. I prefer the Avalon and the dealership treats me better too, but that is another story!
