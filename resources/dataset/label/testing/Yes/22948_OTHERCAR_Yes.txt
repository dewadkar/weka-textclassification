            We bought this 1988 Mercedes 300E when it was 18 months old in 1990, at a used car lot.  It was still under warranty and in excellent condition.  It is a very handsome smoke silver with pale yellow/tan Mercedes fake leather upholstery which is more durable than leather.  A Blaupunkt radio and a sunroof, seat memory, headlight wipers, small sun shield over the rear view mirror, all the Mercedes touches that seem so effete but are quickly copied by other makers.

It's a bomb on the road with super acceleration and handling.  In side it has the Mercedes luxury and comfort that makes you feel rich even if it is a 13 year old car.  The magnificent Mercedes engineering makes it one of the safest cars on the road and provides insurance for the safety of your family.

It has been a joy to own and relatively inexpensive to maintain.  The body paint is now beginning to show its age, but probably only to us.  We still get compliments on the car and several members of the local Mercedes club called about buying it when we got another Mercedes last year. No one believes it's a 1988.  Blessings on that Mercedes paint job and slow styling changes.  Mechanically it still seems solid even with 110,000 miles on the odometer.  There will be some expensive replacements due soon.  We drive it now for activities and places where we might hesitate to use a newer car.  

Just last summer we took it on a long road trip without any problems.  We have never had any surprise problems with it such as not starting in the morning or leaving you stranded.

Our maintenance has been limited to the standard Mercedes maintenance even though my husband likes to lash his cars.  We have moved from using the Mercedes dealership service to other authorized Mercedes shops and found that satisfactory and less expensive.

Something to consider in snowy climes is that Mercedes autos need all-weather or winter tires for winter driving.  Otherwise, you may have some nasty surprises like spinning around and facing traffic.  This is not a front wheel drive.  

It has a heavier feel than the 190s or the C class but I would recommend this car as a second car because of its age, but it could be quite a good everyday car also.  Its safety and sturdiness make it desirable for its under $10,000 present price.
