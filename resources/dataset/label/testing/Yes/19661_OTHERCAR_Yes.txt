            We recently purchased our 1999 Saturn SL2. What a great buy! 

I had been driving an Astro Van, but decided I needed something smaller. We have been very happy with the purchasing experience involved with Saturn. 

First off, no high pressure. We were left to look at the vehicles on the lot at our leisure. 

Secondly, after we found the one we wanted, had test driven it, etc, we went in to the salesman's office. There was NO HAGGLING on price. When we had thru with the negotiating of our last vehicle purchase, I had felt like I'd really been put thru the wringer! This was so easy! We were told this is corporate policy. Before we drove it off the lot, the entire staff on duty gathered around while they took our picture, then actually cheered us. While this sounds really corny, it is nice to be appreciated for spending that kind of money! We have had numerous unobtrusive follow up contact from the company, as well. 

As for the car itself: It runs fantastic. And I am 5'2&quot; and my dh is 6'2&quot;, and we are both equally comfortable driving it. My 2 kids, 15 and 12 are very comfortable in the back seat, too. We got the cd player and the stereo sound is awesome. 

The only thing I do not like about my car is that it isn't red! We bought a demo car w/3000 miles on it off the lot, so the color wasn't an option for me. Otherwise, as I said before, I Love My Saturn!<br><br>
