            We decided to lease a 1999 Honda Accord EX this year, to replace basically the same model which lasted us 10 years.  The care does everything that a car is supposed to do, except for make you fall in love with it.  I said many years ago I wouldn't have a car without some fresh air, and the sunroof in this model really brings it inside.  Acceleration is brisk, and the noise level is so low that you go faster than you think very quickly.  Unfortunately, this is like the difference between a Japanese motorcycle and a Harley Davidson... it isn't very exciting.  Still, all in all, for the price, and the very high lease residuals, for a car that is basic transportation for a family of four, the Honda Accord EX remains a raging bargain.  <br><br>
