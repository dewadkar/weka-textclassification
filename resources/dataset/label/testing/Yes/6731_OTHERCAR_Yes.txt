            I could remember the day like it was yesterday. It was the day i bought my 1990 honda accord lx. what a car it is roomy inside and looks very nice on the outside. this car is great on gas and has never failed me in the three years owning it. This vehicle i would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable cheap durable car. I love the way the car handles it copuld turn on a dime. One thing that i do not like about this car is the lack of acceleration it could use a little more power. other than that i would defintley recommemd this to anyone looking for a good car.<br><br>
