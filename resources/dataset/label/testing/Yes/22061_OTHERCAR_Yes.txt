            This is my first digital camera and I've been pleased with the results. This unit is compact,  slightly heftier than a film camera, and basically very solidly built. All of the photos I've taken have printed well to 4x6. Though the resolution would probably produce acceptable results, I wouldn't want to use it for 5x7's, although Kodak states that you can. 

The menu system on this camera is very easy to navigate using the on-screen display. Overall, the camera is basically a point and shoot digital. The only controls you need be concerned with  are the zoom, flash and self-timer, all of which are logically placed and work as you would expect.

Battery life, like all other digicams, is a sore spot, and you'd be well advised to purchase a set of Nicads and a charger or you're going to be spending the money you save on film for batteries.

Picture quality is very good and color definition is &quot;Kodak Quality.&quot; You shouldn't be disappointed with it. The only bad spot is that the flash is a bit on the strong side, which produces 'flashed-out' photos if you happen to be too close to the subject.

My major nitpik with this camera is the compact flash card door and eject mechanism. The card doesn't eject far enough and  some dexterity (or a set of tweezers) is required to remove it from the camera. This doesn't detract from the overall quality of the camera but it is an annoyance.

For the money I'd say this camera is a good buy for the average consumer. It will undoubtedly be displaced within a year's time, as most technology is, but it is an effortless device to use, never gets in your way, and produces more than acceptable photos. What more can you expect?
