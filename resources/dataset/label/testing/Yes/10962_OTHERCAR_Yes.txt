            I did a little bit of research before buying a digital camera. I focused on price the most, and then pixels.There were other cameras such as the fuji finepix and the sony 2.0megapixels that were around the same price yet had more functions perhaps. Sony's accessories are a bit more expensive (yet its memory stick might be quicker), and fuji's new model was quite bulky also.  The canon powershot is about an inch an a half wide and 5 inches long.  Slide open the front cover and push it into the lock position an it goes on. Settings can be done in about 10 different languages.  For those who want to put their own effects in the camera, they can choose the manual mode and adjust lighting (fluorescent, daylight, cloudy, bulb(tungsten),& custom(evaluate white balance)), focusing (spot focusing, macro, infinite), color (sepia, b/w, vivid, natural), shutter speed(50-400), or you can just choose automatic focusing and just be able to adjust pixel size, flash, and image quality (superfine, fine, and rough).
When I use b/w, the file size is smaller and quality is quite nice. Sepia is also small, I like this color. Whenever I use different lighting modes incorrectly, for instance fluorescent when it is actually in daylight, pictures will have a bluish tinge of color, perhaps you need to be careful of this. I usually leave the shutter speed on 200. However, I find that in this mode, streak marks appeared so I either changed it to 400 or I can also adjust how long the shutter stays open, by points of a second (i believe). Just experiment on your own(some don't mind streaks, especially when taking pictures of night lights downtown for instance to increase the clarity of light.
The camera comes with 16mb compact flash memory card which is small, but then again..my camera settings are on 640x480 or so and superfine, and I am able to take over 50 shots(enough for one day of sightseeing for me). I feel like my purchase of a 64 mb card was useless. The saving speed of the CF card is about 4 seconds or so. I'm not that impatient.
However if you want to use the video capture mode, then the larger memory cards might come in handy. You can also record sound on this one. The mic is on top so don't worry if you block the speaker in the back of the camera with your hand.  
Delayed timing shots can be done and the time delay can be adjusted. 
To personalize the camera settings you can upload  different startup images and sounds from the software that it comes with, I have the tropical one and when the shutter button is pressed, a strum of an ukulele is heard(before it was a dog's bark) 
There is only digital zoom, so in the lcd screen the zoomed image will appear blurry, but when the picture is taken it will be clear. I don't really see any difference between digital zoom and regular zoom. 
In dark light the camera does a pretty good job adjusting, but with flash, the colors are all faded looking.  I try not to use too much flash when there is sufficient light. daylight pictures are beautiful.  
The camera also comes with software and drivers to upload images to the computer via USB. One software acts as a adobe photoshop for dummies(me). Another is just to manage the camera settings and download images (I wish they were integrated).When I upload the images size ranges from 90kb(b/w or sepia) to about 300kb(color).
I bought it just a month ago and already I see the corners start to lose its color perhaps because of constant rubbing in my bag. Maybe it's better if you buy a pouch for it.  The weight isn't that heavy but somewhat noticeable in my bag. I hardly take it around in my pocket...quite bulky that way.Other than that, I feel this product wont crack or break on you if you just carry it in an appropriate bag.
My best advice for this camera: buy rechargeable batteries. Normal ones will die on you like no other.  I bought Sanyo Ni-MH high capacity rechargeable batteries and they last me a while so that I don't have to worry so much about battery life.
Edit: When I first got the camera I didn't know how to adjust the size and image quality of the pictures I was taking. On this camera and on many others, there is the option to choose the size of the picture and for a 3.2megapixel camera you have the following options: 2048x1536, 1600x1200, 1024x768, 640x480 and then superfine, fine, then normal. I currently have the settings of superfine and 640x480 and I can take over 50 pictures with a blank 16mb memory card. The thing is, if I want to blow it up, I would lose a good amount of picture quality.  Thus, many people like to use the larger pixel sizes. I, however use the pictures I take to send to others via email or upload to my website. This saves me the effort of using a photo-editing software and reducing picture size. 
In my case I don't even use the 64mb card I just bought. To tell you the truth, I don't even need a 3.2megapixel camera. I would rather have chosen a 2.0megapixel, yet this one was cheaper than my next choice, the fuji finepix 2.0megapixel model with the quite bulky shape(where the batteries go). Still, there might be a chance that you might need to make a big poster with a big picture. The fuji might exceed the canon in features and quality to some extent, yet I am not one to notice such things.Lastly, the final decision that led me to this camera was its shape and the "why not (get a 3.2megapixel camera)" attitude.
For normal tourists and non pro photographers, this camera is suitable especially when you want to send pics to a friend via email or just upload some to your webpage.  I am pretty satisfied with my first digital camera.
