            The history of the Wrangler has been well documented in other opinions, so I will not recap it here. I do recommend, however, that anyone shopping for a new Jeep reads 'Doccers' account of the storied past of this great vehicle.

I fell in love with the Jeep in 1984 when a good friend bought a CJ7. It was something out of a song the way we spent that summer driving around in topless and doorless freedom. I have owned many cars since then, but never a new, fresh-off-the-truck, everything-I-choose, color-I-desire vehicle. My first such experience was January 1999 when I bought the vehicle I had been in love with since 1984.

My friends drive nice cars. You know, ones with leather and heated seats, headlight wipers and 9-coat paint jobs. I looked at a few of those. I enjoyed driving them. I watched how my friends treated them, you know paranoid of parking lots, worried about thier review mirrors when street parking, washing them whenever the sun came out for 30 minutes, paying speeding tickets, going crazy when the inevitable door ding occurred, covering them in daipers when the snow hit, paying through the NOSE to repair them, etc, etc. We all know the story. I decided that I have enough stress in my life, why add more by worrying about a luxury car parked outside.

So I made the decision to join the fraternity of Jeep owners. It's been two years and I still stop to look back over my shoulder before closing the front door for the night. And it always make me smile.

The Cons of the 1999 Jeep TJ 4.0L Sport:
 
1. Gas Mileage. It's terrible. Don't fool yourself. If you're worried about your gas budget the 4-cylinder may help, but probably not much. Think seriously about spending $120-240/month on gas (at least at current prices).

2. Hauling Capacity. If you need to move a lot of materials, this isn't the vehicle for you. I have augmented my capacity with an excellent roof rack from Expedition Outfitters (expeditionoutfitters.com) and this helps, but you still can't safely haul 3 sets of golf clubs without removing the rear seat.

3. Ride. If you have a sensitive posterior, buy something else. You can improve the ride quality by installing an aftermarket suspension, but this comes at a high price and isn't a good idea for short people. Regardless of suspension, however, the noise is enough at speed to drive one nuts after a few hours. I regularly drive 4 hours to go skiing, but only after installing a louder stereo to fight the noise. I'm generally pretty deaf after the trek.

The Pros of the 1999 Jeep TJ 4.0L Sport:

1. Freedom, freedom, freedom. This is simply THE vehicle of freedom. Throw the doors in the closet, roll back to top, crank up the Dave Matthews and hit the streets, paths, rocks, sand, or whatever is in front of you (I don't recommend hitting the mud without the doors and roof, as it gets messy fast - trust me on this). Pull up next to a convertible car and look down into their entrapment of a vehicle and you will know that your decision was the right one. You will begin to think of convertible cars as hairdryers, while Jeeps are freedom vehicles.

2. All terrain attack. There are many all-wheel-drive vehicles (SUVs) on the market. Most of them are intended to get groceries after the snow storm hits (though by then the shelves will be empty so who cares?). The Jeep, as it says on my title, is a Utility Vehicle (a UV, I guess). This is a true statement. It's not fast. It handles terribly. It's built like a box. There's simply nothing 'sporty' about it. But there is gobs of Utility. Simply point it in the direction you want to travel and engage the clutch.

3. Jeep fraternity. Until you get into the high dollar performance cars, there is very little community with normal cars. For instance, you do not see a lot of Honda Accord Enthusiast get togethers. Buying a Jeep, on the other hand, admits you into an extremely active and public fraternity. You will soon be waving at every other Jeep - and they will return the wave (we're obligated by contract to do so - it's in the purchasing agreement). Look into your local area and you are guaranteed to find a group of enthusiasts who are happy to teach you about all things Jeep - regardless of your experience level.

This weekend I went skiing and Jeep paid for it. They throw Jeep Owner Appreciation Days all winter - drive your Jeep, get 2 tickets free. Not a bad deal. And they also give out all kinds of SWAG at the mountain.

There is Camp Jeep and the Jeep Jamboree events. Events designed for you to enjoy your vehicle with other owners from around the country. The Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, UT. Another great event. The list goes on...

Driving the Jeep is a lesson in patience. It isn't very fast. It doesn't stop on a dime. It rolls in corners. You have to be careful not to run over the little Honda Civic that just cut you off - because that would be bad. I have a modified vehicle for off-road. This makes it both more fun and more dangerous (a frequent correlation).

Future Jeep Owners need nothing more than a desire to drive a vehicle that allows them to express themselves.

Future Jeep owners need not be extremely frugal. Nor do they need be introverts.
