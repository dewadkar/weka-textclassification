            Exactly one year ago, my butt was sitting in my newest car, a 1998 Hyundai Elantra.  It was perfect for me, although it was a fivespeed, which I had never driven before.  But I will tell you what, it was the easiest fivespeed ever.  Not only that, but the car is comfortable, I mean you can sit in that car for hours upon hours of driving and your butt is not numb!  

Okay, well let me tell you how I got this car.  It was at a bank repo auction, the original owner bought this car right off of the lot for over 14,000 dollars.  I paid 6,600 dollars.  I would have paid much more for this car.

Let me tell you something else, my family fell in love with my car that my mother got herself a 1999 Hyundai Elantra, and my brother got a 1997 Accent.  

I have never had a thing go wrong with my car and the mileage is over 45,000 miles.  The only problem was that I kept running over nails.  Other than that nothing, I MEAN NOTHING has gone wrong with my car, or my mothers car.

The only recommendation is, if you are going to buy this car get power windows and locks, because Hyundai does not allow for short armed people trying to unlock the backseat doors, especially the door diagonal to drivers seat.

Also, when I first got this car and figured out how to drive it (although I was very bad at the time) I took my friends out for a drive, and one of them &quot;This car drives like it is on a cloud.&quot;  Need I say anymore.
