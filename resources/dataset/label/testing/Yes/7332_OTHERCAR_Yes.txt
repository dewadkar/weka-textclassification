                 I needed a replacement car after my 1995 Integra was humiliated by being stripped and dumped on a side street resting on 4 donuts.  Looking around for a suitable fun to drive car (okay - I am in the second half of my 40's and the second half of my childhood) I spotted a 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder and couldn't shake the looks.  Was it a Boxster knockoff, a Honda 2000 impersonator?  What is it (a question you will get asked frequently after buying one)?
It is a blast to drive, it is a car that you will not see in every other spot at the mall, it is a designed from the ground up new convertible with a peppy 1.8 liter engine and snappy 5 speed manual.  
     The MR2 is available with a 5 speed only, 4 wheel ABS disk brakes, AM-FM/CD/cassette radio with 4 speakers, white face gauges, power windows and door locks, keyless remote entry, convertible, 2 seater sports car reminiscent of Triumph Spitfires in handling.  The only options available are the wheel locks, floor mats (what's next, keys as an option?), carbon fiber dash applique and leather interior (brown -yuck).  Damn near all, no, actually all of the Spyders I saw had the carbon fiber dash, an option I could certainly live without.  
     I encountered a number of different "sales techniques" when trying to buy the MR2 Spyder of my dreams.  One dealer simply stated "list price, we're not talking" to which I replied "OK, I'm walking".  Another dealer told me "you'll never get one of those, they're sold before they even get here" (sorry I interrupted his lunch by asking for a brochure).  I had an appointment with another dealer to take a silver beauty for a spin.  When I got to the dealership, the salesman was no where to be found.  After 45 minutes, I left.  The same dealer called the next day to ask what I thought of the car after my test drive.  I let her know what happened and sparing the readers the grisly details, I ended up with an appointment to drive the car that evening with the assurance that I would get to drive the silver MR2 Spyder that I wanted to buy.  I called to say I was leaving work and on my way.  The salesman informed me that he had let another salesman demo the car and had just sold it.
     Wondering if I would ever get my hands on this cute, little car, I checked Carsdirect.com.  While the car was listed as limited, it was available, and a good deal below MSRP.  I filled out the form, called the sales rep. (who was very helpful and very funny) and in about 20 minutes there was a silver 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder with my name on it.  Two days later (1 day earlier than I had arranged, I couldn't wait) I picked up the car and paid exactly what we had agreed upon.  No funny business, no hidden charges or high pressure scotchguarding, undercoating sales pitch.  Signed the papers, got an orientation on the car and drove away.
      The car steers with very little effort thanks to the electrically assisted hydraulic steering while maintaining good road feel.  The engine winds up quickly (not too quickly, I'm still breaking it in) and shifts crisply.  The roof, while manual, is very easy to put down and snaps firmly into place (it is a sports car, get out and put the roof down).  Putting the roof up is possible while sitting in the car.  The rear window is glass with a defroster built in.  The ride is smooth for such a small car (owing to the long wheel base no doubt) and the body is tight when going over bumpy roads (no body shake).  The fit of the body panels was right on.  The wheels (alloy) are a very sharp looking 5 spoke design with beefy, low profile tires (the fronts are smaller than the rears).  The hood drops off quickly with the fenders and headlight cover in sight from the drivers seat giving a good feel as to where the front of the car is.  With the dual electrically operated side view mirrors correctly positioned, it was easy to see "around" the car.  The view to the rear is limited by the smallish rear window, but not impossible.  For the price (in the ball park with Miata) the car is a wonderful, just for fun or commuting car.  Just don't bring it grocery shopping on an empty stomach, storage space is limited, but who cares, its a blast-to-drive sports car.
