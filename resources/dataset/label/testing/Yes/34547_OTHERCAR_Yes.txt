            Reading the reviews, I am jelous of all the people with brand new Town &amp; Country(s?) but I love my older one, too. I got it from an arcitect that had just bought a used Jag and needed the extra $ to pay for it. Mine has been upgraded in the audio dpt to a JVC Cd-Player, wich, even know JVC isn't my personal fav. brand, seems perfectly mated to the Infinity speakers, wich by the way are also superb. I love the gold trim.  My son wrecked our 90 Voyager with 13,000 miles and a new transminnion with mabey 250 miles on it, I decited that we wanted to upgrade in buying our new (used) van, so I looked for a T&amp;C, and everyone has been happy in it. The digital dash is cool and all the luxury options are great! My kids love the freat Auxililry air conditioning syste. All the seats are great I love leather. The back bench is a little &quot;short&quot; on leg room for even short people when moved all the way forward, but it doesn't have to be moved forward even when packing luggage for my 6 person family, ALL the T&amp;Cs from 90-96 are the same length as the &quot;grand&quot; vans. You'll love the seats and the van, as do I my wife and my kids.<br><br>
