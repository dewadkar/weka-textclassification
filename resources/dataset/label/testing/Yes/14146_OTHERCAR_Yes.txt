            It was a difficult decision to purchase a digital camera as a gift for my parents -- my father loves gadgets (the more buttons and features the better), while my mother is a technophobe.  Then I discovered the Fuji FinePix 1300, and found it to be the perfect camera for them.  It is easy for Mom to use, and still has enough features to satisfy Dad.  Plus, at $190 online, it is the best value I found (and I did some serious research before making this purchase).

You can literally pick up the FinePix 1300, turn it on, and point-and-shoot just as easily as any 35mm automatic camera.  And yet this little camera has a lot of cool features...

First off, the 1.6&quot; LCD panel is great (Mom really thinks it's cool!) for lining up shots.  You can also turn off the LCD and use the viewfinder.  My only complaint about this is that the viewfinder is right above the LCD screen, so it your face touches the screen.  Not a big deal, just annoying... And although I have been warned about LCD displays wearing out batteries quickly, we used the camera all day long on Christmas without changing the batteries.  I would still recommend getting rechargeable NiCads though, it is a good investment.

Dad was pretty happy to have a USB connection (fast uploading to the computer), digital zoom, and multiple resolution settings, up to 1.3 megapixel.  The zoom took some time to figure out, because you actually zoom in on the captured image <i>after</i> you take the picture, then save the image again.  A cool idea, but probably easier done using the included Adobe PhotoDeluxe or another image editing app.

The FinePix 1300 has four resolution settings (640x480 and 1280x960, with both normal and fine settings).  Using the 8mb SmartMedia card that came with the camera, you can store anywhere from 12 to 89 images, depending on the quality (and the content) of the pictures.

The on-screen menu is easy to navigate, and allows you to change the resolution, date/time set and display, timer, and flash options.

At $190, the Fuji FinePix 1300 was a great value, probably (IMO) the best value among 1 megapixel cameras.  It came with an 8mb SmartMedia card, shoulder strap, and batteries.  Again, I would recommend NiCads, even though this camera doesn't chew through batteries like some other cameras, you will save money in the long run.  Also, I would get a carrying case -- the 1300 doesn't have a lens cover, which is my only other complaint.

It is really a great camera for anyone who doesn't need a ton of features, or the beginner.    You might also check out the FinePix 1400/Zoom, I think these are in the same price range, although I haven't used one.  I looked at a lot of cameras before making this purchase, and I think the 1300 was the right choice.<br><br>
