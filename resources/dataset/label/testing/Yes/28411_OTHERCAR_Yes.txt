                 I purchased my first Maxima over 20 years ago.  After a lifetime of
observing family and friends purchase vehicles that turned  out to be
lemons I decided to do my homework,including research on  autos by
CONSUMER REPORTS magazine.  Don't buy a vehicle  without searching this
magazine first.  I have purchased three Maximas (and assisted by father in
purchasing three Maximas) in the last few years.  My recent purchase is a
1998 version and I plan to purchase the Maxima 2000 in a few months.  The
Maxima has the following great qualities:

     *sturdy, mid-size vehicle-  you will feel safe on the  freeway and
      traveling long distances with this car.  Compare it to the many &quot;tin
      cans&quot; on market.

     *attractive, modern design-  the  Maxima has a classy look, it looks
      great and plan  on receiving unsolicited compliments on your car as
      you drive around town.

     *powerful, 6 cy. engine- it has an excellent engine and is great for
      getting around those annoying trucks and road ragers.<br><br>
