            As a Volvo owner/driver since 1990, I highly recommend the Volvo.  I have driven several kinds, the latest being the 850, but before that I
drove a wagon.  The Volvo has most of the features a young family needs:
safety, reliability, comfort and user friendliness as well as good looks and a certain statement.  With a certain statement I mean that I think  other Volvo drivers value some of the same things I do. They also tend to be courteous drivers. 

Here are some handy tips that I would like to share with anyone looking into owning a Volvo;
1. When bringing in your Volvo to a dealership for service, always ask for a loaner for the day.  In my experience you often get to drive the next model up, which makes the whole service experience more palatable.
2. When using the recycle air button, make sure to turn it off as soon as the offending outside odor has passed.  Otherwise mold can build up inside the air hoses and create mold, with the accompanying odor!
3. You can never lock your keys inside a Volvo! This you only appreciate when you drive another car and leave your keys on the seat.
4. Volvos are inexpensive to insure, probably because they are not on the list of cars that get stolen a lot and because of  their safety record.

Last of all, a Volvo is economical.  Despite the initial price, the Volvo is built to last and will serve up to a million miles when serviced faithfully.  <br><br>
