            During the last few months of 1997 I started thinking about purchasing a new vehicle.  I had previously owned a 1991 BMW 318is, which I loved, and I wanted to get a vehicle with a similar feel.  Over the following several months, I began to research and test drive various cars in the $20,000 - $30,000 price range.  The following list is the original list of cars that I investigated and/or test drove during my research.

Honda Accord
Volkswagen Passat (old body style)
Volkswagen Jetta
Subaru Legacy
Audi A4 1.8T
BMW 318is (before the 323i came out)
BMW 318i 4-door

I didn't really care for the Accord, Legacy, or Jetta.  They just didn't fit my personality.  The Passat was nice but I wanted something a little more sporty.  When I test drove the BMW 318is, I thought that it was a little lower quality than my old 318is and didn't perform as well.  Originally I thought the Audi was going to be out of my price range.  Then I found out that Audi was making a 1.8T model priced in the mid 20's.  I live up a large hill bordering the Cascade mountain range and the idea of owning an all wheel drive vehicle appealed to me.

When I drove the Audi, I immediately thought to myself <i>This is the car I want</i>.  I purchased one in Black, with the Terra Cotta interior.  I also got every option that the car comes with, except for the Tiptronic transmission which just slows you down in my opinion.

The way the Audi grips the road is unbelievable.  I have never been able to get the car to slide, even on wet surfaces, <i> and I have tried</i>.  There is a good amount of torque produced after 2500 RPM.  Often times you don't even have to downshift to pass someone.  Between 70 and 80 miles per hour on the freeway, the RPM is about 4000.  There is enough power left over that I think this car almost needs a 6th gear for freeway driving.  With mixed highway/city driving, I average about 25 miles per gallon which is not bad for an all wheel drive vehicle.

I really recommend getting the sport package with this car.  It adds a tighter suspension, three spoke steering wheel, and 16&quot; alloy wheels with 205 55 ZR16 Dunlop SP8000 tires.  The tires handle great on wet and dry surfaces (believe me, I get nearly 100 inches of rain a year which is three times more than Seattle).  I would also recommend buying the premium sound option which adds an 8 speaker Bose stereo system with a 6-Disc CD changer.  It sounds REALLY good and I would never be able to find a reason to replace it.  The all-weather package, which adds heated seats and door locks, is unnecessary in my climate because it rarely drops below freezing but sometimes the heated seats are nice anyway.  I really love the convienence package, however.  It consists of a sunroof and remote locking doors.  Even in my rainy climate, the sunroof is nice because it is made of glass and lets in a lot of natural light.  The back seat is a little small but it fits a rear facing infant car seat just fine.

If you are the type of person who likes a car that is zippy that handles really well, this is the car for you.  Even with a lot of options, the price came in under the BMW 318is.  My car now has over 50,000 miles on it and still runs like the day I bought it.  The only thing I have had to have replaced was a noisy tie-rod at 45,000 miles and it was covered under warranty with no questions.  I wouldn't trade this car for anything.
