            I've never even <i>considered</i> buying a Jaguar up until this year. Their cars were always big, expensive vehicles made for people who like to flaunt their money. I like nice cars, but I don't want to spend an arm and a leg, and I also don't want something so huge that it's not fun to drive. 

The X-Type is the first Jaguar to appeal to me. It's priced within range of cars like the BMW 3-series and the Volvo S60, and it offers what I feel is a good combination of styling, luxury, and performance for the money. Definitely in <i>my</i> sweet spot!

Let's take the car for a spin and see how it stacks up against the competition...

<b>Curb Appeal</b>
Some people might buy Jaguars for their performance, but I think when it comes down to brass tacks, most will tell you that they buy it for the styling. The X-Type is no slouch in the curb appeal department. It will turn heads, I guarantee it.

Looking at the car head on, you're drawn to the two smallish round headlights, looking like cunning eyes carefully watching your every move. Jags have sort of a feline look to them, and its apparent from the front end of the X-Type, which looks like a young cub of the larger S-Type. The long sloping hood adds to the sleekness of the car.

The only perspective I don't think is going to turn heads is if you're looking at it from the side and towards the back. At this angle, the car shows that its body was patterned on the Ford Contour (especially the trunk line). I don't want a sport-luxury car that looks like a Ford Contour -- nobody <i>ever</i> looked twice at that ordinary suburban driveway ornament. 

I'm wary of luxury cars that share too much with low-range vehicles. I still have nightmares about those hideously ugly "Maseratis" that were sold around the 1980 back when Chrysler got its claws into the old Italian nameplate. Do you remember those cars? There was this outrageous contraption that was obviously a Chrysler LeBaron, but that had too much chrome stuck on the front end and was plastered with the respected Maserati trident. Nobody was fooled, except for the suckers who plunked down lots of cash for a crummy dolled-up Chrysler. I sure don't want to be a sucker like those guys!

I don't think the X-Type is in that category. Not even remotely.  

The X-Type is unmistakably, bumper to bumper, a Jaguar design. While it bears a fleeting resemblance to the Contour, the differences far outweigh the similarities. And those differences become more pronounced when you sit in the vehicle and when you size up its performance. Let's check it out...

<b>Sitting in the Lap of Luxury</b>
My first impression of sliding into the driver's seat of the X-Type is "Wow! This is pretty posh!" The car <i>feels</i> just a little more refined than competing sedans in this price range. 

The leather seats are soft and comfortable and Jaguar boasts that their Connolly leather is the best in its class. I'm not really into leather (no matter what lies Madam Bertha tells you!) and so I don't know if Connolly really means anything to a purist or not. My rear end says that the seats certainly feel comfortable, and I like the electronic seat adjustments with adjustable lumbar support. The maple trim is elegant and refined, and it probably appeals to many of Jaguar's traditional customers, but I might actually prefer a more spartan looking trim design.

I love me music. Always have, always will. I never outgrew the urge to cruise down the street with the windows down and the volume cranked. I'm impressed by the stereo system and I like the tiny speakers set into the upper part of the doors (why do some car makers put speakers down near the floor? your feet don't have ears.) The one nit I have with the stereo is that the model I'm looking at doesn't have a CD player standard, while competing vehicles that I've recently driven have all had CD players. I'm not sure I want to have to pay an optional charge to get this feature. You can also upgrade the stereo to a pounding 180 watt system with 10 speakers for a measly $1,200. I think not...

There are a lot of little gizmos and gadgets on this vehicle, including a way to integrate your cell phone with steering wheel controls (requires a $1500 upgrade package -- youch!) and its got rain-sensing windshield wipers that turn themselves on automatically (hope I can override that one -- don't want the wipers torn off by a carwash brush). 

<b>Promise and Performance</b>
The X-Type is available with two engines: a 194 horsepower 2.5 litre 4 cylinder in the basic configuration, and a peppier 231 horsepower 3.0 litre V6. I promised my wife that I would not, under any circumstances, buy a car priced over $40K, so I (somewhat reluctantly) stick to the smaller powerplant. Even if I add the 

Jaguar's promotional materials boast that their acceleration is about the same as BMW with the smaller engine coming in equal to the BMW 325 and the 3.0 litre coming in at 6.6 seconds on the 0-60 test (same as the fastest spec on a tricked out 330). Any of the cars in this class will perform well, and I don't see much point in debating the minor performance differences between the X-Type and the BMW 3-series or the Mercedes C-class (which accelerates a little more slowly), but there is one big difference in my mind. The Jag is quiet -- much quieter than either the BMW or the Mercedes. Right from the moment I turn the key in the ignition, the engine starts quiet, revs quiet, and it stays quiet as I take it up to highway cruising speed.

Overall, this is a sweet little car for the money. I always had an image of Jaguars as being stuffy cars for stuffy old guys, but the X-Type is genuinely fun to drive. Stacked up against the competition, I like the interior comfort and styling of this car much better than the Mercedes C-class, but I still prefer the handling and feel of the BMW 3-series. Stacked against Volvos offerings in this price range, I think the S60 outperforms the X-Type. It's tough to say that any one of these cars is much better than the others. It's a good time to be a car buyer!

Until next time, see you on the road.
