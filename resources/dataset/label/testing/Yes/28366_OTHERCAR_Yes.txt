            When my dad�s 1992 Lexus LS 400 was stolen last year, he wanted to replace the lost car with a Mercedes Benz, instead of a new Lexus.  He then looked around for a great Mercedes Benz, and he found it about a year ago with the 2001 S55 L.  He went for a Mercedes Benz, because he knew that with European engineering, it means quality and the peace of mind that it has crumple zones.  The crumple zone is basically the cage that absorbs the energy from an accident and dissipates the energy back by dropping the engine instead of breaking the passenger cabin.

<b> Experience </b>

After about a year of driving the Mercedes Benz S55 L, he found the product to be reliable with no faulty hardware.  As for the accommodations, it�s a rider�s delight.  It�s made even better with the addition of the electrically adjustable contour seating along with the standard adjustments for the seat and the steering column.  All this translates to comfort.  With the available electric rear seat, it allows the rear passengers be treated like CEOs.  Even the ventilating seats offer a refreshing seat for hot summers, and it�s not noisy like the Saab�s ventilated seats that have very noisy fans that vacuum moisture and to cool the seat.  This option is only worth the extra cost in certain areas where there isn�t really winter.  With the automatic climate control, it provides frigid air like a home air conditioner, yes even the rear compartment have their proprietary controls for the air conditioning.

The climate control was also excellent, except that the controls were mounted too low on the dash though.  But the steering wheel mounted controls do help a bit.  The dash-mounted telephone was also a handy feature, even if you want to dial in the car; it�s an ideal solution for the executives, because of their cell phone use habits.  With the extra TV screen ready for the navigation system, my dad wished it were a CD player as well as the navigation system.  However, the car was fitted with a CD changer in the boot (trunk) and the stereo can control the CD changer, due to the pre-wiring that was offered.  However, for the instrument panel the speedometer was oversized and the tachometer was undersized, if they were about the same size, then it would have been better.

The materials itself were top-notch quality, the finest leathers and woods.  The car was fitted with Extended Nappa Leather, which gives it a premium touch and the Chestnut wood fitted into the dashboard, doors and the floor console gave it a very warm touch to the interior ambience.  They were fitted very carefully and the paint was even flawless without a scratch, dent or noticeable crevices by feel.  Even though the wood was really a veneer, I would still evaluate the fit and finish first rate.

Even the resale value of the S55 will be high, because of the excellence in engineering and craftsmanship. This is all because of the unique crumple zones that you won�t even find in a Rolls Royce, BMW, Lexus or even a Jaguar.

For the handling, it wasn�t exactly the best, but it did manage to corner nicely and the body slightly leans during tight cornering.  Even the suspension was smooth enough to absorb the bumps from the road to assure a smooth ride.  Even the tiptronic transmission gives it a sporting feel.

With the extra large boot, it provides plenty of room for a weekend trip for four and with plenty of room leftover.  Even golf club sets can fit easily.

<b> Ugly </b>

The only thing that�s really ugly is the price, at about $120000 when subject to exchange rates from the Euro, it�s a rather pricey choice.  That�s even pricier than the S600.  However, it�s worth the money for those who really want comfort, luxury and performance.

Another one is that the S55 is a gas-guzzler.  But it�s just a minor one since most cars in this league are gas-guzzlers.

Finally, since the S55 isn�t really a mass produced vehicle, it tends to cost more and it requires a special order charge, but it�s worth the wait for all the cravings.
