            I'm usually against anyone getting a van. I think women driving them are just old housewives who shuffle the kids back and forth, and any men driving them are doing it because their wife wanted his car for the day. Everyone saw the commercial that came out a few years ago that busted the guy lifting weights in the gym when it said,&quot;whoever drives the tan mini-van... your lights are on.&quot; What guy would want to drive a van.

I would. Mercury has produced an excellent product. It handles like a sports car, and drives like something out of the indy 500. That whole thing about the kids... hey, who minds giving them an extra room. You can pimp down to florida in a BMW and listen to them complain, or you can throw them in the back of a van and let them sleep. What makes for the better vacation? I don't mind driving, and I recommend it to anyone else who isn't too embarrased to be seen with it. At least take a test drive.<br><br>
