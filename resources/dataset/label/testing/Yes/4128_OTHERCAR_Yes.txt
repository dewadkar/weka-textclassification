            The 1991 Trooper XS is my second Trooper.  After my 1986 2-door LS went 147,000 miles with only a carburetor problem, I decided the solution for my growing family was a good-looking 1991 4-door XS.  It has the Chevy 2.8L V6 and a 4-speed automatic with overdrive.  It has fair power, but I wish Isuzu would have made their own V6 in those days.  I haven't had any problems yet, but my experience with other 2.8/3.1L engines has not been good.  We'll see, I guess.
The big body rides great, but trailer-truck drafts really push the front end around at high speeds.  That's the only down fall to the tough boxy look of this truck.  It performs well off-road, and has enough chassis covers and brush guards to build another Trooper out of.  This is one of the few SUV's that really is capable off-road or on.  Tire choice makes a big difference; you get high-speed noise with off-road capability.  The utility is great; you can pile all three car seats in back, or fold the seats down to haul 8-foot lumber home with the doors closed.  Parts are plentiful and fairly inexpensive.  If this '91 does as well as the '86, I'll be buying another Trooper in 5 or 6 years.
