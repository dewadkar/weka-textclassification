            Are any of you out there one of those people that always said that you would have a sporty car or an SUV? Well I was one of them. And after  having a Grand Am for a first car and loving it it was hard for me to let my husband to buy a Mini Van. Well just recently I went and bought a Taurus SE Wagon. I really didn't like my mini van for the fact that I won't be having more 5 more kids, it wasn't a very safe car, price was way out there, and no matter how easy they say it is to get kids and others in it, its not. So aftermy husband and I went through the idea of getting a new car to get out of our van I decieded that I would like to test drive the Taurus Wagon. It was a wild leap for me since I never wanted a wagon. But after careful listening and looking around, I weighted some of the things that we wanted in our car. First we needed space for the kids, second cargo space, since we have a cat and dog and are always moving, (being in the military). The Explore and many other SUVs have the same cubic FT. of cargo space. The wagon gets better gas milage. This 1999 wagon comes with all the safty features that I want and need in a car. It has the add feature of seating 8 passangers if the need arises. With three people able to seat in the front, three in the back seat, and two in the rear facing seat in the cargo area, which flips up to seat and folds away when not needed. The roof rack is addjustable for small of big loads. This car runs smooth and quite. plenty of leg room for my tall long legged husband and kids. I love the automatic seat ajustable, making it easier when we switch drives on a road trip. The stero is in easy reach unlike others that you have to reach for. With Ford Taurus  being one of the safest cars on the road I Highly Recommend it.<br><br>
