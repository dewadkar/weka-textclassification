            I bought this vehicle because it is comfortable and smooth riding. On long trips you can recline the seats and relax. The other reason's I enjoy this car is automatic locks and windows. This vehicle also offers cruise control,airbags and good gas mileage.It has an option of a CD player or a cassette player.

I can honestly say that I have no complaints with my car. It is very dependable. I haven't yet to make a visit to a garage yet.If you are in the market for a luxury,dependable,comfortable,smooth ride and good gas mileage vehicle,I suggest you look at a Toyota Camry LE at your local Toyota Dealer.<br><br>
