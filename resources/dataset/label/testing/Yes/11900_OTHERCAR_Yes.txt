            I'm thrilled with the ease of use of my 780C.  I opened it, used it, came home and created a web page with my new images within an hour.  The software is simple and self-explanatory.  The big selling features for me were the fast recharge time (2 seconds), ease of use, price, and the cool look of the blue case (so what if I'm shallow?)  The image quality is excellent, and the capacity even with the smallest 2 mb card is 22 images on the highest resolution and 165 on the lowest.  Since I can instantly delete bad shots, I haven't yet maxed out the capacity.

There is some room for improvement.  Most notably, the indicator light in the viewfinder creates so much glare that it's impossible to see through in low light.  You do have the option of using the LCD screen as a viewfinder, but that brings us to problem #2: the thing sucks through batteries like nobody's business!  I would advise investing in rechargeable batteries, since a set of 4 AA's will only last for a day or two (or about 20-30 shots.) 

I use my camera mostly for pictures of my baby and family.  There is no zoom, so you do have to get up close: about 4-5 feet is the ideal distance for the head-and-shoulders shots I prefer.  Also, the flash is only good for about 3-8 feet, which seems less powerful than my 35mm camera. I am used to working with a long zoom, so it feels a bit more intrusive to have to get quite literally &quot;in their faces&quot; to shoot a picture.  

I think everyone could use this camera.  It's inexpensive enough to let the kids use it, and offers good enough image quality to be used for any business purpose.  It is a great introduction to digital photography.  Eventually I'll want to upgrade to a camera with all the features of my  35mm, but this camera will always be in my backpack for snapshots wherever we go!
