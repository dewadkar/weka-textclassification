            This camera for the most part is very user friendly. Without being a camera expert you can begin taking pictures almost out of the box. This camera belongs to the company and has been used by others and myself. I have had no complaints on the camera to date. 

Several things to note:

1. When the power is turned on the lens extends and the cover will (pop) off. If it is not secured in some way you may lose it. I made a tether for it and connected it to the strap eyelet.

2. The location of the power button is a little confusing. The power button is inside the mode control button, while the picture button is inside the zoom button. I, and others, have mistakenly turned off the power when trying to snap a picture.

3. Still not sure when the display comes on or goes off. Seems that it has a mind of its own.

I would recommend when buying this camera you get the optional extra memory and the 3.5&quot; Smartmedia adapter. This is the most convenient way for multiple users to get data from the memory card into the computer. The cables work fine if there will only be one user.<br><br>
