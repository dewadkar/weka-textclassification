            My husband and son Joe purchased the Sony MVC-FD88 as a 1999 Christmas gift for me and I absolutely love it!  I'd been looking at digital cameras for some time and always came back to the Sony.  I had hoped they would design a smaller one, but that was the price to pay for the ease of loading into my PC.

I work on the ninth floor of an office building over-looking the lake, so I took my camera to work one day and was able to take beautiful pictures.  The zoom was terrific.  I can preview the pictures immediately and the viewer is 2" x 1.5".  The menu bar is displayed on that screen as is the number of pictures on the current diskette and battery time left.  As I look at it now, I see I have 74 minutes left and only 1 picture in memory.  Usually I can get 6 or more images on a disk.

I'd worked with other digital cameras that had battery limitations, down-loading took forever and other problems.  I see none of that with my new Sony.  <b>I'm very happy with it.</b>  

One of the previous reviewers mentioned a design flaw of the viewing screen being exposed.  It's such a nice large screen, that reviewing the picture is sooooo easy.  But purchase a case for it for protection.

I'm still exploring the <b>Camera Options</b>:

Self Timer
Standard and Fine settings
image size (1280x960, 1024x760 and 640x480)
Exposure options
Auto or manual flash levels
white balance
digital zoom on/off.

I've played with the Neg/Art, Sepia, B/W, and solarize setting when I was taking close-up shots of flowers.  Would make great screen savers.  Sepia gives such warm, red tone...neat for antique looking shots.

I print my shots on an Epson Stylus color 850.  Yesterday I took a picture of possum in the back yard.  What a great shot!  He was in a tree, framed by the branches.  His pink noise is clear and you can count his whiskers! 

 I printed this out on Epson Photo Paper in less than five minutes.  All you do is load the diskette, bring up your photo software and print.  I didn't even have to touch this one up.  I wish you could see it.  

I've had others use the camera, just to demonstrate it and they took great pictures as well.
