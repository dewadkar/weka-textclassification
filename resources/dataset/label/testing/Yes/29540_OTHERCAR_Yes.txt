            I bought the DC240 in May 1999.  Compared to other cameras that use a "floppy disk", I was sold on the "memory card".  And, I was right.  I easily transfer any/or all of my photos to my desktop or laptop (when traveling).  I read the manuals thoroughly and learned how to work with this camera.  The quality of the pictures are really good on the computers and even on the internet.  For batteries, I have 2 sets of Kodak rechargeable batteries.  This is the ONLY way to go with batteries as battery life is low on any digital camera.  The "delete" feature is good as I can choose the photos to delete before transferring to computer.   Since I bought the camera in 1999, Kodak came out with an adaptor for adding lenses to this camera.  Now I can use a wide angle lens and any other 35mm lens.  So, this camera now does everything that I need in a camera.
