            The Mavica FD-73 model is a wonderful camera that is easy to use and fun to play with.  Although it does not have as many options as some of the other digital cameras I have used, I do enjoy this cameras compact size compared to others.  Digital cameras allow the user to point and click at an object without having to look closely through a view finder.  Rather, the photographer looks at a picture window on the back of the camera and therefore you can more clearly see what the picture will look like.  This camera stores pictures onto a 3.5&quot; floppy disk, and when one disk is full you can just pop another in.  It is also extremely easy to view the pictures you have already taken and delete them while in the camera to make more room on a disk.  Therefore you do not need to worry about making every picture perfect...if you mess up, just delete.  I love how easy this thing is to use!<br><br>
