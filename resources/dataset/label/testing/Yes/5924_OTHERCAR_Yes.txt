            I have always wanted a Jeep cherokee.  I live in a remote area and needed to be able to get around the farm I live on without problems.  I finally decided to buy one a year ago.  At first I was going to buy a brand new one, but staring at $500 a month car payments made me curl up my nose.  Also watching my mother with her brand new one afraid of doing anything with it for fear of getting a scratch on her brand new shiny jeep.

I went with an older one, a 1991 for a little over $3000.  After owning my jeep for a year it has spoiled me.  I will never own a different model than a jeep cherokee.  

I do not consider my jeep an suv, it is a truck.  Suv to me is a name for urban toys like the explorers or the Jeep Grand cherokees.  Nothing wrong with suv's mind you except their large price tag and the work being put into all these extra gizmos instead of the durability.

I want to be bounced around, I love the feel of my tires rumbling down the highway.  Being a country gal my jeep fits perfectly with me.  Also living on top of a hill, Stuck winter days are a thing of the past.  I am able to get out and get anywhere at any given time without problems.

As far as durability, my jeep has 130,000 miles on it.  She still starts right up and has only needed new brakes since I bought it.  Her interior looks brand new still and you can't tell any difference from my moms brand new one and mine sitting side by side.

I like that Jeep has found a good thing and stuck with it.  All the other car makers, when they come up with a car that is a good seller, decide to change it every year or so.  Like the Ford escort, how many times has that car changed?  It means jeep is comfortable that the consumers will always want their jeep.  Its the original all terrain truck and it has won me over time and time again.<br><br>
