            I waited quite awhile before purchasing a digital camera.  While always a photography enthusiast, I was never impressed with the quality of digital cameras or the annoyance of the low battery life.  Then I tried the C2020. 

This camera is one of the first truly viable replacements for film cameras. the 2.1 megapixel resolution is excellent for almost any situation.  Though they are now making many 3 megapixel cameras, I find it very hard to discern any difference between the quality of a 2 vs. 3, in my opinion take the lower cost camera! The addition of an optical zoom versus a CCD electronic zoom would be nice, but not really necessary at this price point (less than $600 in some places).  Images are excellent.  Digital Quicktimes are a bit gimmicky, with quality similar to the old 8mm movies... but fun for quick shots.  The rechargable batteries on this unit last longer than any other digital camera I have used! I find myself using the film camera less and less.

My wife uses this camera extensively.  While she doesn't utilize many of the advanced features, they are nice when you need them.  The interface is easy enough that you can use as a point and shoot or go full manual and do more creative things....  

I highly recommend purchasing at least a 32mb smart media card and a USB card reader.  For about $100 combined, these accessories make the camera that much better. I find that I actually prefer the removable smartcard media to the built in USB interface in many of the more expensive options (ie Nikon).<br><br>
