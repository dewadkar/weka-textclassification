            When I got pregnant, I knew I wanted to take loads of pictures for the babies. I wanted a digital camera. We bought a S110 and it was very nice as well. We recently bought a S200. This one is even easier to use.

First of all, I learned about this camera when we were traveling with a tour group and a fellow tour member had one of this so we actually tried it out.

The menu is very easy to use. It is so small and light weight, I keep it in the diaper bag or next to the sofa so that I can take pictures for the baby when he is doing something cute. We have a 128 Meg memory card and it holds more than 120 pictures at high resolution. Now, it only creates pictures for 2.0 megapixel so it is not for those who want to enlarge the pictures to poster size.

The camera is so easy to use and so small, we never need to think whether we want to carry the camera with us when we go out or traveling. If you go to places that you would worry about your properties, this camera is also perfect. It is so small that you can put it in your purse and don't need to look "touristy".

There are two features that I like most about this camera. One of them is that it is very easy to delete pictures. It has a short cut button for it. In the S110, you need to go through a series of key presses to get to the delete menu. S200 makes it so much easier. Why do you want to delete your pictures, you may ask? Well, it is the nice thing about digital camera, you can see the pictures you have taken and decide what to keep and what not to keep. If you are using traditional film, you have to take extra shots just in case and you still need to wait for the film to be developed to see whether you got it right. As I said I use the S200 to take pictures for my baby. Babies move. So I just position the camera right next to my face when I play with the baby and keep taking shots as he is smiling and wiggling. After the session, I review what I have gotten and delete the shots that I don't want. It is much nicer than taking pictures intentionally because my baby recognises the camera and he only stares at it.

The second feature I like is the software that comes with it. First of all, the installation is very easy and straight forward. I have to admit that I am a programmer so if you absolutely have no experience on computer, you should read the installation manual first. But if you read the installation manual, you will be fine. One of the software that comes with the package is called PhotoStitch. I love it. We use it to make panaremic shots all the time. The camera has this panaremic mode that if you turn it on, it will tell you how far left or right you should move and have the pictures overlap. When you are done wit the pictures, use the software to "stitch" them together to make a wide shot. We even did a 360 degree circle shot. The picture is very wide but very cool.

We had an underwater case for the S110 but we didn't buy the one for S200. We may if we go on another trip. The underwater case was very useful. We took lots of pictures when we went snorkeling.

Oh, I do want to say something about the cool factor. Everytime we take the camera out to take pictures, people around us are so amazed that it is so small. It is a wonderful conversation piece.

Because of this camera, we take a lot more pictures and they are all pictures that we will keep. By the way, you can get a lot of the accessories like extra battery, memory card, carrying case, etc on eBay for very very good price.
