            The Saab 95 is a very fun car to drive.  The numerous special features such as 6-CD changer, seat warmers, dual climate control, the radio controls on the steering wheel, and hydrolic cup holder make the Saab a very fun car to drive.  It is very cool with all these gadgets and such.  The outside is very sleek looking, comparable to the cool looking leather interior.  Driving the car is very easy too, and has quite the acceleration.  However, the car has a tendency to slide in the snow and on icy roads.  Also, the car has a tendency to have little problems with it.  In about a year, the car has needed servicing four or five times.  I think that the Audi A6 is much better to drive overall and more reliable, though it has fewer luxuries.  <br><br>
