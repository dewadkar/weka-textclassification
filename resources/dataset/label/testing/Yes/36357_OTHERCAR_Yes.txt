            I bought this car about 2 years ago at the local dealership. I fell in love with it as first sight.  It had all the options including a Vtec engine that gave the car plenty of umph.  I also test drove a newer automatic model without the Vtec and it just wasn't the same.  
Since I bought it, I've put 40,000 trouble free miles on it, and it still drives like the day I got it. Believe it or not, the tires are still the ones I drove off the lot with. 
As far as how the car drives, its a real smooth ride, with plenty of power. It loves to rev at high rpms. The Vtec kicks in at around 4800 rpm, and you really feel it when it does. It hums at 80 mph on the highway, and I've actually fallen asleep a couple of times. Its a real change from my other car, a 1985 Toyota pickup that struggles to get up to the speed limit, and when it does, sounds like a airplane about to take off.
The interior is also a plus.  There is plenty of room in the front, and the sunroof gives it a more open, spacious feeling.  I'd say it may be a little cramped in the back, but I'm 6'1 easily have enough leg room.  As far as the seats go, I can live in them.  They're really comfortable, especially on long trips.
Before I finish this epinion, I've had many experiences with this car but one sticks out in my head the most.  I work in a logger town, where a lot of low income people living in trailer parks make up most of the population.  One night, I was driving home from work in my Accord, and this car pulled out of one of those trailer homes behind me and started to tail me. When I got on the freeway, they pulled up next to me in their 80's firebird or camaro (they all look the same) and started to yell and make obscene gestures at me. At this point I was doing 70 and thought it was very dangerous to stay next to these guys.  I shifted into 4th, immediately kicking in the Vtec and rocketed past them.  I must have been going 90 when I shifted into 5th and continued on past 100 mph.  To my surprise, first of all, the car was just cruising with no problem.  Second of all, those guys were nowhere in sight. (and I thought camaros were fast)  I thought I pretty much lost them and reduced speed to 70mph and continued home.  A short while later, just as I was about to exit the freeway, the car I thought I had lost went rocketing past me and I was going 70! I don't think they saw me cause they kept going and I turned off on my exit.  But thats just a personal experience with my accord I had that stuck out in my mind.
If you are considering buying this car, I highly recommend you doing so.  Its actually not a muscle car which I may have portrayed, but rather a good all around economy, family sadan.  And by the way, the number of warranty claims for Honda Vtec engines since 1988 is non.  This car is the definition of reliable and will last you forever.
