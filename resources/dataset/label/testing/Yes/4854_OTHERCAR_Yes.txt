            The current <b><a href="/content_84222971524">Mitsubishi Galant</a></b> is getting old. The current generation started its life for a 1999 model year and was slightly restyled a year ago.

<b>Styling</b>

I must admit I don&#146t like the restyled grille and prefer the previous chrome grille. Also, for the model years of 1999-2001 the car used to look unique/unusual, unlike the other Japanese cars, which looked too generic. But now, with the release of updated competitors like <b><a href="/content_65336479364">Toyota Camry</a></b>, Honda Accord and <b><a href="/content_43087335044">Nissan Altima</a></b>, the Galant looks too old-fashioned.

<b>Interior</b>

The main problem with Galant&#146s interior is the lack of quality of assembly and the lack of rear leg room. I like to drive with the driver&#146s seat moved all the way back, and in this position, there is not enough space for the passenger behind to place his/her feet.

The materials of the dash are OK with soft plastic covering it, but definitely no match for Honda or Toyota. Same holds true for the assembly quality of the interior &#150 the gaps are a bit too wide. The <b><a href="/content_43087335044">Nissan Altima</a></b> has cheap-looking interior made out of hard plastic, but at least it looks assembled with better panel fit.

The Galant&#146s glove box is large, but its lid is heavy and you may expect having to replace the glove box lock at least once in 2 years (based on experience with previous models that have the same glove box design), because it starts to rattle.

 The room in front is sufficient for me (I am 5&#146 11&#148 tall) and the storage box between front seats can hold about 7 CDs. The lid of it has two cup holders for the rear passengers (when the lid is open).

The standard equipment includes an AM/FM CD player with 4 speakers, which sound surprisingly fine. The Air Conditioning controls are within easy reach, but they have no position for air both towards the floor and the windows at the same time.

The car comes with power locks, mirrors and windows. What I like about Galant is the fact that the turn signal has very precise (solid yet easy-to-move feel).

<b>Other</b>

The tires (4-cylinder model) are 195/65R15 and are smaller than some of the competitors, but you can replace tires with 205mm width tires without replacing the wheels. For example, you can get <b><a href="/content_72392216196">205mm-width Kumho 712 HP4</a></b> mounted on the stock wheels to improve handling, braking, noise levels and ride.

The 4-cylinder engine is by no means a high-performance powerplant and it is coupled with a standard 4-speed automatic transmission. However, the engine is quite torquey and it is easy to induce slight wheelspin if you are not careful with the gas pedal starting off the line.

The fuel economy is a little worse than Accord or <b><a href="/content_65336479364">Camry</a></b>. The engine is quite old-fashioned with single camshaft and no variable valve timing/lift. But it is more than enough for &#147regular&#148 driving and the acceleration seems faster than it really is.

The transmission is quite good at downshifting quickly, but has no manual controls over the gear selected. However, you can limit the range of available gears by moving the lever from "D" to "L" (1st gear only), "2" (1st and 2nd) or "3" (1, 2 and 3rd gears available).

There is no shift indicator on the dash, so you have to look down when shifting sometimes and that is not cool and can create potentially dangerous situation.

The brakes are discs in front and drums in the rear (4-cylinder models) with available antilock control. They are easy to modulate but prone to lock-up in emergency situations without antilock control option. Especially with the lame 195mm standard tires.

Replacing tires with <b><a href="/content_72392216196">205mm-width Kumho 712 HP4</a></b> improves handling significantly and mitigates tire squeal and sliding in hard turns. In any case, the handling is predictable and the ride is more sporty than the ride of the <b><a href="/content_65336479364">Toyota Camry LE</a></b> I drove recently. There is less floating around.

Headlights definitely benefit from replacement of the stock bulbs (H4) with PIAA Extra White bulbs, which produce better lighting, especially off-center. The car comes equipped with fog lights that improve visibility close to the car substantially.

<b>Maintenance</b>

The car requires 7,500-mile maintenance intervals or 3,000-mile for severe conditions. I usually check the color of oil to see if it looks suspicious, but in general try to replace oil every 5-7 K miles.

<b>Pricing</b>

The Galant currently costs much less than Accord and <b><a href="/content_65336479364">Camry</a></b> and comes with automatic transmission as standard equipment. But both Accord and Camry are somewhat better equipped, have more interior space, provide better fuel economy, depreciate less and should be more reliable.

<b>Conclusion</b>

If you are looking for a family midsize sedan with lots of space (or for adequate space for the feet of the passengers in the rear), <b><a href="/content_84222971524">Galant</a></b> might not be for you. But if you don&#146t need much space for the rear seat passengers and can get Galant for substantially less than similarly-equipped Accord, <b><a href="/content_43087335044">Altima</a></b> or <b><a href="/content_65336479364">Camry</a></b>, it might be worth considering. 

I have to give it four stars, taking into account that it currently sells for around $14-15K, which is very low for a mid-size Japanese sedan with automatic transmission.
