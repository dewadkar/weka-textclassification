            This is a brilliant car.  I test drove one on the same day I drove a 2002 Nissan Altima 3.5 SE.  Both cars lay rubber in second gear, but the SE-R does it with 75 fewer horses, 500 fewer pounds, and $5000 fewer dollars invested, comparably equipped.  Best of all, it�s a wolf in sheep�s clothing, a stealth fighter that looks like an underpowered subcompact sedan.  People challenge you when you drive a sports coupe, but they don�t bother with subcompact sedans.  This is one subcompact that will make them wish they had paid attention.  It has roughly 50 hp and 50 ft-lb torque advantages over the Honda Civic EX.

The Spec V is like a Learjet.  It combines the acceleration, speed, and comfort of a big car with the maneuverability and price of a small one.  I own a first generation AWD Eagle Talon turbo, so I know how a powerful heavy car handles, and I prefer agility.  I�m guessing the Subaru Impreza WRX should handle like a Talon boosted to 15 psi � fast, but with the agility of an Accord or Camry, not an MR-2.  My previous car was a 1995 200SX SE-R, and the Talon�s improved power/weight ratio doesn�t make up for its bulk in turns, not to mention the 33% gas mileage penalty I pay to drive it.  My fun factor goes way down with truck-like vehicles.  It hits all-time highs with the Spec V.
 
There�s a significant gap between second and third gear ratios, but the SE-R doesn�t drop out of the fat part of its 180 ft-lb torque and 175 hp curves on shifts.  It doesn�t clean my old �95 SE-R�s clock by much in flat-out racing because it runs out of breath at 6300 rpm redline v. the old car�s 7700 rpm redline (tweaked from the factory 7100 rpm with a JWT ECU).  But in regular driving, the Spec V�s mountains of torque give a tremendous real-world advantage in roll-on acceleration, similar to the Golf and Jetta VR-6 without their weight penalty.  The six-speed transmission lets its 2.5 liter variable valve engine cruise at an easy 2800 rpm at 70 mph.

Handling is crisp, but watch out for significant torque steer (oversteer) in sharp turns.  Thanks to its front and rear strut tower braces, the car feels rock-solid in corners and over bumps.  I drove a friend�s 2000 V6 Mustang convertible while shopping for this car, and the Mustang handled like a �60s dinosaur compared to this SE-R.  Where the Mustang was slow (shifting, turning corners, going over bumps), the SE-R was fast.  Where the Mustang was fast, the SE-R was faster.  The Mustang is a handful in the rain, with RWD and gobs of torque wanting to make you swap ends.  The SE-R�s FWD with helical limited slip differential is way, way better.

Other people have complained about price-gouging by dealers.  The first two dealers I visited wanted $1995 and $995 over MSRP for the Spec V, but I found a third who was willing to deal for a couple of hundred over the invoice price and a couple of hundred under MSRP.  Maybe it�s the mediocre reviews the SE-R has received from the press, or maybe the hype has already worn off, but I didn�t pay much of a premium for my SE-R here in northern CA.

If there�s a disadvantage, it�s that every Spec V I saw was loaded with ABS, side air bags, moonroof, 300 Watt Fosgate audio, and 6 speed CD changer.  These features harm performance, raise the weight, and raise the price roughly $3000 over a base Spec V.  If you can find a base Spec V, it�s going to sell for about the same price as a Honda Civic, and you don�t have to be a rocket scientist to know which car is the bargain.  I have a bias towards Nissans and Mazdas, as they have the build quality of Toyotas and Hondas without the exorbitant markups of the name brands.  I�ve owned five other Datsuns and Nissans that have been far more reliable than two of the four Toyotas that have been in my family.
