             I decided on the Jeep Cheerokee for many reasons, for instance the size, the past history of the performance of chrysler products, and also the price. 

 I love this vehicle because it handles wonderfully, it is stylish without draining out your bank account.  I also love it because it is roomy which is very handy in those everyday instances when you need to fit a lot in a vehicle.  

 I do not have children right now but I like the fact that this vehicle has child safety locks on the back doors. Another thing I like is the fuel economy, the way gas prices are going up it is hard to find a good 4x4 that will not take 50- 60 dollars to fill the tank.  The Jeep Cheerokee gets about 18 mpg city and 21 mpg highway.

 When you drive this vehicle you do not feel like you are driving just another sport utility but a big sports car.  I think this vehicle is great for people with families, people are going to start families, and for anyone who wants to have style and dependability.<br><br>
