            The best thing about this vehicle is its performance. Thats a difficult statement to make about most others in its class. The Jeep Grand Cherokee blew away everything else I tested. (and having a brother that works for a major rental car company, you can believe I tested everthing I could get my hands on!) 

As an Avid snowboarder in the SF Bay Area, I look at the 3 hour trip to Tahoe more as a commute then a day trip. I made this trek so often and in so many different rental vehicles, that I could probably work for JD Powers and Caltrans as a &quot;consultant&quot;. Over the years I have always opted to rent, rather then buy because of where I live. I don't have much need for a truck outside of going snowboarding, and with gas prices and extremley limited parking huge factors here, its always been too pricey.

But that all changed as of last season. 

After beating to death, my previous favorite, the Dodge Durango (the Jeep shares much with this model), outgrowing the much smaller Montero Sport and the &quot;weakly motivated&quot; , tiny, Nissan Pathfinder/ Infiniti Q4, a place in my garage was cleared for the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 

A perfect match between comfort (keep in mind I'm 6'4&quot;) and extreme performance, the Jeep was flawless after personally putting close to 6k miles on the rental I used repeatadly. (I cant say that about any of the aforementioned competitors, as they all had there significant drawbacks and &quot;quirks&quot;). The Jeep so impressed me that I bought one. And after 4 months, I am happy to report, close to perfection. Its ride is smooth, though trucklike around town. Its a breeze to drive through traffic, has a decent turn radius for those quick u-turns, and has way more then enough power to tackle the hills here in San Francisco. It came well appointed, though I opted for an aftermarket soundsytem, and a Tule-roof rack. The gas mileage is borderline dreadfull, but I use my other car (88 celica all trac) for the messy daily work commute.

 I have had many the opportunity to put its very capable 4 wheel drive system to the test, and it, so far, has out performed my expectations. Just enough ground clearance for mild to morderate off road travel, plenty of power, though the &quot;stock&quot; tires would need an upgrade for any adverse off road conditions. As for snow, in most instances you never notice it. Smooth transfer between the wheels allows for limited wheel spin on most snow covered roads. The brakes where a bit stiff and take some coaxing when delicately navigating downhill terrain, but its barely worth mentioning. 

I still have a long way to go, as I expect much more of my vehicles, in terms of longevity, then most. But as of 4 months, 5k miles, this thing is a dream. I recommend it to anyone with the need for extreme performance in adverse conditions, as well as, comfort on those weekley mountain commutes. If you are just looking for around the town drivability, this truck will do well, but I wouldn't recommend it as a daily driver. Something with better gas mileage, better emissions, less rigid suspension and more compact would probably make yours (and the rest of our) lives easier.<br><br>
