            Before I bought the 2001 Chevy Silverado (1500 extended cab, 5300/5.3 litre Vortec V8, shortbed), I'd only driven a truck once or twice.  They all felt big and clunky and made me feel separated from the ground.  Now, I know that this truck was the best purchase I could have made.
The sticker price was nearly $25,000 but with a lot of haggling and about 4 hours, I was able to get the dealership come down to a price of $20,500.  That's not bad for an extended cab and a big 5.3 litre engine.  I probably could have gone lower to $18,000 now that I think about it.
I got a lot of bang for the buck except I did have to give up power windows, locks and a CD player.  At least I didn't sacrifice the safety and security of an alarm, dual airbags, anti-lock braking system and some other standard features.
My wife spent her whole adult life driving little Toyotas and after she married me, she 'upgraded' to a 92 Caprice Classic which she calls a tank.  I was worried about her approach to the Silverado, but she immediately fell in love with the spacious interior, higher view and the ease of steering.
I enjoy the kick of a V8 and the safety it will provide my wife and infant.  The extended cab is well worth the investment.
Being my first truck, I was a bit concerned about the gas mileage of 16 city, 20 highway. It's the payoff of such a powerful engine I guess.
I look forward to getting a hitch on the truck and maybe a camper and using it to move to New England sometime next year. For the price, comfort and safety, I feel 200% better about moving in my very own truck than renting a big Ryder moving truck.
