            I bought it at wal-mart and was hoping to take some really good pics with it.  One thing that sorta peeved me a little was when you want to take a pic and press the button, there is a 1-2 second delay.  It may not seem like a lot but i take some sports and action pics and you have to learn the timing of the camera so you get the best pic.  That's what i miss about my old 35mm, it was instant.  

It will take pretty good quality pics, about a 7/10 on my scale with it's highest resolution.  Otheriwse one the 1st and 2nd res. dont even bother, not good.  I bought a 8mb memory card for $20 so i can take more pics on high res. With an 8mb card i can take 45 pics on the high res; which is indicated by 4 stars, 90 on 3 stars, 142 on 2 stars, and 330 on one star. I use 4 stars about 99.9% of the time.  

The controls on the camera are easy to use and naviagte throug your pics.  Good functions to make sure they dont get deleted.  

Also, what i liked was that you can hook it up to your TV and browse through pics.  So your like going throug a photo albulm on your TV!

Battery life is not it's best feature.  But to consever it, always use the AC apapdter when putting pics to your comp and whenever possible.  

VERY DURABLE. It fell out of my pocket several time and landed smack on the pavement.  Only thing that happened was the battery pop topped off.  Everything was still working perfeclty.

It is very easy to use.  A good family camera.  Software, photomax, is always pretty good.  That too is VERY easy to use and has tons of editing options.  However, as with all pics, when you print it and enlarge it the quality wont be too great.  

Simple connections to computer.  Every so often i will have a problem, but I'll just shut down/restart and have everythign working.

Last but not least, with the battery life, when it was about hlaf way the LCD wouldnt work all the time. You have to have high battery life for everything to work quickly. 

Wouldnt get it for action pics, just simple still photos.
