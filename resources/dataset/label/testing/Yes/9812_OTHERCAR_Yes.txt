            I purchased a 1999 Protege LX, right after the new (and now current) body style was released for about $13,500.00 and haven't been disappointed since.  I've driven over 75,000 trouble free miles and the car still drives like new. (With new tires and regular maintenance being the only costs.)  

The LX and DX engines were the 1.6L 105 hp engine then and not as spunky as the ES with the 1.8L.  Today, I think they all come with the same 130hp 2.0 engine, which I wish they had when I purchased.  With a 5-speed, I get around town fine and actually do OK in the Rocky Mountains but air conditioning really zaps a lot of what little power there is.  But on the positive, I still average about 33 mpg on lots of mixed city and hwy driving.

Road noise is the only other downside--especially when I compare it to my wife's 2000 Subaru Outback wagon.  I have performance-oriented tires which add to the noise.

Overall, the car is still a blast to drive.  Comfortable and easy to handle in parking lots or on twisty mountain passes.  The trunk is very roomy too and the CD player is easy to operate and has great sound.  It's been a great value and I plan to have it until at least 200,000 miles.

OCTOBER 2003 UPDATE:  I've driven 102,000 miles on my Protege and it still runs like new.  Only routine maintenance has been needed, though struts may be next. (Thumps and bumps are louder than should be--Big O says it'll be about $500 for new front struts alone!  Still cheaper than car payments!)  I just finished detailing my car and was reminiscing all the TLC I gave it when it was new with almost weekly washes.  Now I abuse it and seldom hand wash it unless I feel up to it about twice a year.  The body is full of scratches and dents now from occasional shopping carts etc., but it's running flawlessly with no oil loss or rattles.   Maybe new tires would help it run more quietly but that's the only other flaw that irritating.  I average about 34mpg on hard city/highway driving.   It has the original clutch but I replaced the timing belt at 70,000 miles.   The detail work has brought back a luster that I remembered when it was new and it reminded me how much I loved the car then and actually how much I appreciate it's reliability and consistency now.   

love reading about all the new cars out and all the whiz-bang technology that goes into them--getting somewhat envious, but I often wonder if the cars will hold up as well as my 1999 Protege LX.  I doubt it.  That's why I'm holding onto it till it can't be driven any more!
