            My wife and I test-drove everything in the Elantra's class over the course of about 2 months, but we kept going back to the Elantra for several reasons.

1. The warranty.  We needed a reliable car because we were only going to have one vehicle for at least a year.  While every new car has some type of warranty, the Elantra came with a 5 year/60,000 miles warranty, 10 year powertrain warranty, and 5 year/unlimited mileage roadside assistance program.  Hyundai has had a tepid reputation in the past, but that massive warranty package put our minds at ease.  If it did break down, we wouldn't be paying for it.

2. Value.  Toyota's and Honda's don't even come with air conditioning standard! The '99 Elantra came with A/C, cup holder, and even fold-down rear seats, all standard.  About the only thing you would want to add would be a CD player (much cheaper to do on your own) or the moon roof.  Add to that the Elantra usually has some sort of cash back offer on it, and we paid less for the loaded Elantra than we would have for any other comparable model at its base package.  On a side note, the trunk is much bigger than you think, especially when you have the option of folding down the back seats.

3. Style.  Sadly, the Elantra has since been re-styled, but the '99 Elantra was a refreshing change of pace compared to the ever-boxy Hondas, Toyatas, and just about everything in its class.  (The Beetle was out of our price range at the time.)  We really liked that we found something that had a little bit of a fun, sporty streak to it in that class.

4. Fun to drive.  The '99 Elantra really gives you a good view of the road.  It's quite peppy for a 4-cylinder engine, and it handles well also (though not as tight as the Honda we drove).

So, we bought the Elantra.  And how happy are we 15 months later?  Quite, actually.  We have had a few minor problems -- the brakes were installed incorrectly so they had to be adjusted a week after we bought it, the transmission pan had to be replaced a month ago -- but they've all been minor, and thanks to the warranty we haven't had to pay for any of them.  

We've been able to test the Roadside Assistance program twice - once because we left the lights on, once because my wife somehow flooded it (we have a previous history of driving junkers) -- and are happy to report that they were quick to get to us, but not as quick as the 30 minutes that they claimed at the time.  It's more like an hour, but one occasion was a holiday, so that's a little understandable.

Our biggest complaint is pretty small one, and it's something that we were aware of when we purchased it: There is a LOT of wind noise.  The engine itself is very quiet, but when you get on the freeway at 55 mph on up, be prepared to turn up the radio and/or speak louder.  Again, it's not the engine, and there aren't any rattles, it's just the wind noise.(If you're interested, the Mitsubishi in the same class was the quietest car we test-drove, but didn't have as good of a warranty or standard options.)

If you're looking for great value, warranty, and standard options and are shopping in this class, the Elantra is a great vehicle to consider.  Aside from the wind noise, there are really no complaints about this car beyond what is common in a car of such size. But even in those considerations, we found the Elantra to have a decent trunk and a back seat that still leaves passengers a little space.
