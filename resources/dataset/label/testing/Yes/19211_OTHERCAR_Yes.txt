            The 2002 GMC Yukon Denali is ready to take on the competition.  Just name these competitors:  2002 Ford Expedition, 2002 Lincoln Navigator, 2002 Toyota Sequoia, 2002 Cadillac Escalade, 2002 Chevrolet Suburban and 2002 Ford Excursion.  It is my opinion that once you get inside this truck, you'll make up your mind right away.
Once again, I find myself behind the wheels of this superbly designed SUV for a test.  Ah, the marriage of cars, big cars, SUVs with California!  On a cool, Spring-like morning, I reported to the local dealership and handed over my demographic info before being allowed to test-drive this beautiful truck.  Not any sport utility vehicle!  

I did not have to worry about legroom and headroom.  In fact, this full-sized SUV is so roomy that you will think you are in the back of a limo.  It can comfortably seat 8 people.  It offers so much more in terms of power, maneuverability, style and safety.  We must not forget that its giant size exudes respect and strikes fear in the mind of many drivers on the highways and freeways.  It just looks that way.  Yet, it appears agile in its moves.  The 2002 GMC Yukon Denali has an average height of 76.7".  You don't have to worry about your steps.  Please don't bring a ladder or a stirrup.  It comes equipped with the step-rail.  After examining the Denali's trim and beautiful body, I climbed in to discover a whole new world.  There is no doubt its interior is so spacious.  

<b>What are some of the amenities inside this SUV?</b>
Some of the things you will notice right off the bat.  You will observe the dash.  Everything is so neat and well laid out.  Just once, I was happy with the way the engineers coordinate all the little elements to give you the impression of comfort.  All of this is before you even put your foot to the pedal.  The matching color of the leather seats with the rest of the interior is superb.  I immediately fell in love with the black cherry wood-trimmed instrument panel.  Everything is so easy to use and so accessible.  Just lift up your head to peer right into the sunroof.  This is a very sporty addition.  It's available on both models, the base Denali and the this larger XL Denali.

Before the salesman drove the truck out of the lot, he gave me a brief demo.  He was happy to ask me a few quick questions about my family.  Then, he pointed out an amenity that my kids will like so much.  <b>Rear audio controls and headphone jacks allow passengers to listen to individual music selections.  Wow, this is an alternative solution to the kids' problem on long trips!</b>.  Then, he opened the trunk to show me how happy my spouse will be to load up her groceries and merchandise.  Actually, I was already making plans of all the things I could load up in the trunk.  The Denali is very generous when it comes to space.  After finding my way to the 11-speaker Bose 6-CD changer stereo, I set the dial on a station playing some hip hop music.  The salesman was all too happy to try something else.  It was time to leave the dealership and head out to the nearby freeway.  I kept looking at some of the <i>little amenities of comfort we all have come to appreciate. </i>  I discovered a nice deep box in between the front seats that served as storage, armrest and cup/food/beverage holder.

<b>How does this SUV handle, dude?</b>

Despite the sheer size of this Denali, it handles just like a car.  Its ride is smooth and quiet.  No noise from the road caused by tires on the pavement.   The virtues of this truck reside in its trailer-towing capability. This is the top-of-the-line model with a 6.0 liter V8.  There is a true powerplant running under the hood of this elegant truck. The Vortec 6000 V8 produces 320 horsepower and 365 lb ft of torque that works well with the four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.

<i>Standard amenities include</i>:  power windows, and power programmable door locks, Onstar communication system, leather seating, front side air bags, and many other standards.  How about safety equipment?  Think about air bag driver, depowered, air bag, passenger, depowered and side air bag.  Just remember that this is a huge truck.  So the gas mileage will be about 13 mpg.

Do you care about <b>power, lots of it?</b> There you have it with this GMC!  On the freeways, I did not have to worry about other cars at all.  I was negotiating lanes after lanes.  The only thing that was on mind that new unmarked patrol cars.   You never know when one of them will be right behind you.  Remove the lead food off the pedal.


<b>Truck is very popular with go-getters and movers; both male and female car enthusiasts are hooked on it</b>

If you don't mind investing in such a great vehicle, you will be assured by the fact that you have a strong and lasting SUV.  

<b>Final thoughts</b>

I recommend it to business executives and professionals.  Also, I don't see any reasons why a mother should not drive one of them, especially if that mother had been working hard all these years.  For a Christmas present to your own mother, nothing else can beat this SUV!
