            I did not buy an Explorer, but I work for Hertz Rent a Car and my girlfriend (also works for Hertz) owns a 98 Explorer Sport so I drive and abuse these car on a daily basis. First off I want to tell anyone looking to buy a SUV should rent one to make sure it is the one they can live with!!! There are so many models that can fit any life style that you have to make sure the SUV fits yours. 

The Explorer is the family SUV. It has lots of space (4 door only) and is very comfortable. Make sure you get the 4.0 ohc engine (99 or later for best depenability) it is far more powerful than the 4.0 ohv engine. Don't let the sales person confuse on this point because they will try if they have a lot of these engines that they have to sell. The only benefit they have is that they are about $300 cheaper, but because of the low power you will be stepping on the gas more and this is one reason why Explorers get such poor gas milage. 

This is not the SUV you want if you plan to go off road (see Jeep Cherokee). The suspension is set up for the road with 4 wheel drive for snow. It is big,heavy,with low ground clearence.It will sink and get stuck in deep mud or sand. The 2 door sport model is significantly smaller with a stiff bouncy ride, even for a SUV, and a back seat that is not very comfortable with stiff seats and useless head rests. On the highway it is fairly quiet except for wind noise and handles well. Priced high but a good value for those looking for roomy family transport with a great view of the road,4x4 for snow, and tough SUV looks.      <br><br>
