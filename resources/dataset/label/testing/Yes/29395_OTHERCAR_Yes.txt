            This is my &quot;Dream Car&quot; the ultimate... INFINITI Q45... sit back and enjoy pure comfort.So fasten your seatbelts...The Q has a 4.1-liter,32 valve v8. The interior is like a resort..Rear sunshade,digital auto temperature control,anti-glare rearview mirror,cruise control,spacious glove compartment.And get this,12.6 cubic feet of trunk space. &quot;WOW&quot; I could sleep in there....Arm rest with storage space in the back seat. Also comes with the HomeLink Transceiver,so you have security from the drivers seat. Okay,now indulge yourself by turning on the Bose acoustical custom designed,CD/cassette player with 8 precision placed speakers AND steering wheel-mounted controls. Is this not a fabulous car??? And with the spacious interior, not only do you have room for comfort,but so does your passengers.  Oh ,there is also safety features you'll love..Duel front air bags,anti-lock brakes, SIDE-impact air bags,4-wheel power disc brakes with abs,xenon headlight. I love this part..REMOTE keyless entry. Is this not the car. pure style,and great performance.. <br><br>
