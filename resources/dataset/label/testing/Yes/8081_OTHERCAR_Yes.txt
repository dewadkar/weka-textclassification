            My husband and I purchased this minivan, after alot of research. It was one of the best purchases that we have made. 
I had a major phobia about driving a larger vehicle, I have always driven compact cars. I am no longer afraid of that since this vehicle. 
I love that it has rear dutch doors, it makes it so much easier to load groceries, or anything else you have, into it. 
We drove this van from where we live in KY to TX, and it was a wonderful, easy trip on us and our two kids. 
We got the 7 seat arrangement, and it is so nice and roomy. It has three places to hook up electrical appliances, etc. which is really convenient. Underseat storage on the passenger side, that is really nice for storing maps, cd's, snack foods for trips etc.. 
It has a sunglass holder, which was not something that I thought would be any big deal, but I have found that it is actually really nice to know where they are during rides for easy access. 
I also really like the way that the front console is set for easier viewing by the driver. Everything is facing you as the driver, so that you have very easy access to the controls for the heat, air, music, all the gages. Even the glove box is located right beside you and you have immediate easy access to it as well. 
I love everything about this van, it is a smooth comfortable ride. I would say that anyone that is seriously looking for a good, reliable, attractive family vehicle should look the GMC Safari over seriously, it is well very worth the money.<br><br>
