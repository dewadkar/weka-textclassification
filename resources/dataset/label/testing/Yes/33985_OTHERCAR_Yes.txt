            I also bought this camera because of price and I got what I paid for.  it does exactly what is advertised, no more, no less.  I write a newsletter for a non profit every month and needed a digital camera to add photos to the letter.   It does a fairly adequate job.  The pictures aren't magazine quality (National Geograhic photographers have nothing to fear from me), but they serve their purpose.  It is user friendly and you can play around with the pictures and add them to clipart galleries and use them with many other desk top publishing applications.  The pictures are quite as sharp as I would desire when you print them out but they make really good watermarks to add to letters, cards, checks(if you print your own) or I use them behind articles in my newsletters and brochures.  All and all it's O.K. and is a good camera for kids and anyone who wants to take pictures where the quality isn't real vital.<br><br>
