            The Kodak DC240 is a great digital camera for a reasonable price.  Lately digital cameras are a hot item and this is the camera where you can get the most out of your  money.  It auto-focuses for you and is EXTREMELY user friendly.  The options and panel when you begin to use the camera are simple.  I have used other digital cameras (such as AFGA) which are confusing and not as simple as this Kodak camera.  The quality of the photos also come out extremely well, and if you have a good printer they come out as if they were developed.  Maybe the only problem to this perfect camera is that, if on vacation or somewhere, if you are in a rush or something you may find it a bit cumbersome since it is larger than a normal camera.  You will be able to take MANY more pictures with this camera rather than the standard film camera, it's small memory cartridge is able to hold 300+ pictures.  This is definetly a digital camera you would want to buy.  You don't even have to buy a more expensive camera because this is perfect- it is simple and does a good job, whereas more expensive cameras tend to get more pricey due to more features, but then more complicated.  Buy this camera now if you want to buy a digital camera!<br><br>
