            Last month my husband and I jut purchased our first new car. Well actually its a 1999 left over from last year. I must say so far I am very pleased with The Stratus Es. I can't believe how well this car handles for being a four door sedan. One thing my husband liked beside the leather seats was  this is a v6 with a 168 horsepower. The car has an automatic transmission but it has a special feature called an autostick. The autostick lets you use the car like you would a manual, you can shift gears if you like. My husband wanted a clutch but I couldn't stand to learn how to drive one, now we have both worlds and are both happy. Before buying this car we had a Ford Explorer. I was so used to the bumpy ride. I think I forgot what a comfortable drive was. I guess with only having this car for a  month I don't know if I am going to have any problems. Knock on Wood. I read all of the reviews and everything was great.But I know one thing, the comfort of the ride, great handling (even at high speeds), and safety features this is a great car. I am looking forward to taking this car on vacations this summer. If you are in the market for a new car and take a look at the nearest Dodge dealership and give this on a test drive you might even give up your Ford.<br><br>
