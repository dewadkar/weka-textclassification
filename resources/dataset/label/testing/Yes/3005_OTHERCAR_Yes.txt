            Review of 2004.5 C320 Sport.  I chose this car over the new Acura TL, Audi 3.0, Saab 9.5 and BMW 330i.   I really liked the RWD, quietness of the cabin, German steering feel, and beautiful look of the sport package.  I also like the safety record of Mercedes Benz,and the fact they aren't on every young professional's doorstep like the BMW 3 series seem to be.
Performance -- This car is plenty fast, even with the auto tranny.   A lot of low end torque that gives you strong push during acceleration.  The engine sound is very coarse, however -- not nearly as smooth as the Acura or BMW.
Handling is acceptable, but not great.  Feels like there is just too much weight here to toss the car around like the BMW. Ride is wonderful -- best in this class.  It feels like a Benz.
The luxury features on the C320 are very nice.  Power everything, and the "Rest" feature of the heater keeps the cabin warm for 30 minutes after shutoff -- great in the wintertime.
Looks are very subjective, but I love the new sport package.  It lowers the car, adds bigger wheels, and a sporty exhaust.  Really makes the car look more the part of a sport sedan instead of luxury cruiser. 
The only real downside is spotty reliability.   I've heard horror stories of the quality problems with Mercedes C-class, and so far my car has its flaws.    Like most C-class problems they are more minor annoying issues than major problems, but when you compete with Lexus, you have to be near perfect.  I've had problems with squeaks and rattles, as well as wind noise from a faulty door seal -- all in the first month.  MB service is wonderful, but these cars shouldn't have such problems.
Overall, I'd recommend anyone looking for a sports sedan to check it out, particularly if you don't like being beat up by a harsh ride.  This car is very easy to live with daily, if you don't mind minor problems here or there.
