            When I first saw the RAV-4 on my way to work in 1996 I knew that it was perfect for my wife. We usually have owned a 4x4 of some type but found most of them to be lunky, hard to maneuver and park, and terrible on gas. My wife likes the driver height in 4x4s because it generally provides better visibility (and attendant safety).

We have owned our RAV-4 since 1996 and have found it to be perfect for its intended use. We've taken it on camping trips with four people and it has been plenty large. Of course we have the optional roof rack and usually put the tent and other equipment up there. It's outfitted with the Toyota hitch receiver and we regularly use it to tow a utility trailer (8'). We live on an unpaved road up a steep embankment in snow country... all challenges for my SAAB. The RAV-4 doesn't seem to even notice. It pulls the trailer up very easily and, because of the great turning radius and responsive steering, combined with terrific visibility, makes backing and parking the trailer very easy.

Best of all, on a day to day usage basis, it's economical and comfortable. Everything continues to work well after six years and the interior comes up to almost new when we've had it detailed.

The only minor problem that we've had is when we backed into a tree on our property accidentally. The rear door mounted tire barely touched the tree but caused the door metal to bend in. While we could still use the door, the crease in the metal was unsightly and rust began to form. This cushioning effect of the metal might have been good in the event that there was a rear end collision but it was an expensive 'tap' on the tree.

I highly recommend this fine vehicle and would definitely buy another one. I don't expect that we'll need one though for quite a while given how durable this one is. I believe that this latter fact makes it an excellent investment as a used car. A five year old RAV-4 with 70000 miles costs only about half of a new one and, it's my belief, that its worth almost as much as the new one. There is so little deterioration it's almost amazing. Buy one and enjoy!

(12/03 Update) This is one wonderful vehicle. It still looks and runs like new. We just did the first extensive service after six years of use, including plugs, tune up, brakes, tires and detailing. It's like a brand new car! If something happened to this one I'd look for an older one (i.e. 96-98...) to replace it. They just don't seem to age which makes an older one a fabulous bargain. It's been relatively inexpensive to maintain... routine service has been ~$200/year. First new tires this year too.
