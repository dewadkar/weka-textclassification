            Dodge introduced the minivan, so it comes as no surprise that they still build the best and continue to revolutionize the industry.  Many people won't even consider buying this because its quality, they say, is not up to those of foreign made cars.  I believe that our American workers do a better job than import companies.  And why not help AMERICA's economy?  The 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan is the best looking minivan out there.  It has features seen no where else --power liftgate and doors all at the touch of a button.  Plus features that other competitors have --a movable center console, optional DVD Entertainment System.  What about a third row seat that folds into the floor?  Although functional, those seats are quite uncomfortable.  Nothing like the quality of these.  The overall quality of the vehicle is first class, right up with the imports, and leaps beyond the Ford Windstar.  The V6 engine is responsive and powerful, but the ride is whisper quiet and completely smooth.  I can't even tell if the engine's running.  The CD player/radio has features usually only found in more expensive cars, -If you turn off the car while the CD player/radio is running, it will continue playing for 30 sec. so you can hear the end of a song, and you'll want to after you hear how good the stereo sounds.  When you turn the vehicle back on, a CD will start playing from where it left off.  This is also the only vehicle with tri-zone temperature controls.  Meaning you can have THREE different temperatures and two different fan speeds for driver, passenger, and rear occupants.  This vehicle has been just as reliable as our past two Grand Caravans, a 1996, and a 1988?.  They hold up great.  Great vehicle!
