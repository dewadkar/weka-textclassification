            Got this digital camera for my birthday- I have no patience for reading instructions unless absolutely necessary, so fortunately it was easy to learn hands-on.  I took about 40 pictures within 1/2 hour of opening it.

What's included: wriststrap, 4 AA batteries ("titanium" batteries- they do actually seem to last longer too), USB cable, software, 8MB memory card, and of course the camera and instructions.

The software is really easy to load and configure- the main software that transfers the pics (thru the USB cable) gives you the option to store pics in sub-categorized folders by date if you like, and also to erase the pics from the camera when done transferring.  They transfer quickly too.  Photo editing software and album-creation software is also included- the photo editing software is pretty cool- they have a lot of effects and editing tools.  You can email, print, and save from the editor as well.  I didn't try out the album one much- didn't really interest me, but the interface for that was easy too.

Quality of pics: there are three settings you can choose- all of them look great on a computer monitor, but you'd want the higher settings for printing.  The con is that the better the pic resolution the more memory it takes obviously, so that means less pictures on your card.  Lowest setting can store 80, fine setting stores 20, and superfine setting (best for printing) stores 10 on the included 8MB card. However you can buy additional cards- we purchased a 16MB card for $22, and they have larger cards available as well.  Also as long as you have access to your software/computer you can just transfer the pics and begin again with the empty card.

Other features: Has different flash options, including red-eye reduction, auto, off, etc.  Has hole in bottom so that you can mount it onto a tripod- also has timer function.  It has an LCD which is nice because it's easier to center your picture through it.  It has the capability of 2.5X zoom- couple of cons with that- we found that for the pics to look good using the zoom we had to use the fine or superfine setting- otherwise they blurred a little.  Also, you can't zoom without the LCD on and extensive use of the LCD is what mostly drains the batteries.  (we just bought a few sets of rechargeable batteries so it's not a big deal anymore)From the LCD you can also view and erase pics, set time/date, and adjust the brightness of the LCD itself.  Oh yeah, and all of the pics you take will have the date/time in the properties.

You can also buy (separately) a power adapter for when you're transferring your photos.  When the power supply is plugged into the camera it automatically overrides using the batteries so you don't drain them while transferring.

I haven't yet printed a high-quality picture since we only have a B&W laserjet right now, but I'll update this when we get a photo-printer and try it out. I also threw one of the pics I took onto a webpage- so if you want to see how the pics look on a monitor (pic was taken on lowest resolution setting) go to http://home.mmcable.com/vinceandlaura/photo.html
I didn't edit the picture at all- it's the same resolution/size as how it came out of the camera so you can see what it does.  The pic on the webpage only took 107kb- beats using a scanner for printed photos that take a lot more memory than that!

I haven't dropped it yet or anything, so as far as durability goes I really don't know, but it seems like it could take it's fair share of abuse.
