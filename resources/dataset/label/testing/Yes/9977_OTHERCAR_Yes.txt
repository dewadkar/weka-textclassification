            I drove a BMWZ3 and when the lease ended, I bought my SLK.  I could not be happier with the SLK.  What a difference there is between these two sport cars.  The SLK is better made, quiet and safer.  I enjoy the sound system and find the controls very simple.  This is a real beauty with the top up or down.  I cannot believe all of the people who give me thumbs up whenever they see the top work.  This vehicle is great fun to drive and I love the heated seats.  When I leave my home at 6:00AM, for a racquetball game, it is usually cold outside.  No problem, I put the top down and enjoy the heat on my back.  I had back surgery in 1989 and the heated seats are a must for any car I own.  I heard that the 2001 SLK's have power seats.  I think this is a real plus for the car and look forward to leasing a new SLK very soon. The last thing I can say is that with the top up there is plenty of room in the trunk.  My wife bet me I couldn't get three good size pieces of luggage in the trunk.  I won the bet, hands down, and our sex life hasn't been better!!!!

I am very happy I made the choice to buy the SLK and will do it again when the lease ends!<br><br>
