                My mom bought a 97 neon four door because she had run down her other car from all the driving she does. She drives about 45 miles from home and back from work. So she decided her next car would be a good gas mileage car, the Neon is that.The other car she had to fill up at least every other day, The neon every five days unless she decides to stay home after work.
    One day I got the chance to actually drive the car. I liked the smooth drive compared to my escort, and the pick up the car had to give, I never really got the chance to really race the car, lets face you don't race the moms car unless you have the money to maintane the car after words. The only problems I had was the fact the rear of the car was to high it made it hard to see the distance of the car behind you, the other problem was the lightness of the car when it rained the tires would spin out regardless of how light you press the pedal, I felt they could have some how put more weight in the front of the car.
   I liked the amount of space the car had I actually could fit four people in it comfortably, another pro against my escort. The sound system in the car wasn't bad either for a factory sound system the down fall was no tape or cd player well it is my moms car.
   Well after 3 years 70,000 miles and relentless driving it is starting to give out My mom had to put it in the shop for electrical system repair, and we found a small crack in the block only because of a rock that flew out of a truck and hit the underside of the car. So my mom is thinking about another Neon. <br><br>
