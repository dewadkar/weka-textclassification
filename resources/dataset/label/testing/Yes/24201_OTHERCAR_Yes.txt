            I had experience with a cheaper digital camera before I bought my Sony. It was easy to operate but took less that average pictures.  I am not a technical whiz and did not want a camera that needed a rocket scientist to operate it.  The very first day I had the camera I was taking shots that I had never been able to do with the other camera.  It adjusts the lighting for you (if you want), you can make email size pictures to send over the internet and a variety of other sizes for printing.  I have had the camera 2 weeks and have taken about 150 pictures of my grandson, the dog...anything that got in my way!!  Everything turns out great!  I am tickled to death with it!  I would recommend it to anyone!

The only thing I dislike is the instruction booklet.  It is written in the tinest print conceivable.  I took it to work and blew it up on the copy machine.  VOILA!  No problem!

I would recommend this camera to anyone. It will take about 50 pictures in 640x480 on a 4MG memory stick...comes with the camera.  It also comes with the serial cable and the adapter.  BUY ONE!  You'll love it!!!<br><br>
