            This is a fun car to drive yet it is practical everyday car.  
On the fun side you've got to start with the engine which is smooth and powerful.  You don't have to use the sport shifter to make this car move but it helps if you do.  My wife is not a car person but she said "what an engine" when she heard the sounds for the first time at 6500RPM.  Pretty good for an engine you can barely hear at 70MPH when cruising.  

I find the ride firm but not at all jarring.  The steering is quick but not so light you lose touch with the road. It goes where you point it and corners flat.  While I have not driven this car at the limits it doesn't show the understeer so common in FWD cars with reasonably spirited driving.  
What makes a car fun to drive?  It's not just power it's also feeling connected to the car and the road and this car delivers that.

The sport shift works well.  I actually find it most useful when cornering.  You can downshift to keep the revs up while you braking so that you can apply power smoothly as you exit rather than having to kickdown the automatic.  It is much easier to drive smoothly and quickly with this capability.  For average everyday driving it's not required.  My wife never takes it out of D5.

On the practical side the Type S has all the bells and whistles.  A favorite is the memory mirrors and seats.  The trunk is big but wish the rear seats folded down.  The pass through helps.  It would be nice if the passenger seat had an up/down adjustment.  Overall the seats are very comfortable.  We just leave the headlights on all the time but it would be nice to have official daytime running lights.  The headlights do go off automatically. 

26 MPG so far.
