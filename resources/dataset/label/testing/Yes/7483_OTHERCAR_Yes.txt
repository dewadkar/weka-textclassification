<TEXT>
            I own a 1995 Toyota Pickup.  It has nearly 160,000 miles with only schedule maintenance. This is the most dependable transportation I have ever owned.  My family has a 4x4 Toyota with over 200,000.  These trucks are build to stay with you.  The extended cab seating is really only large enough for children and not very comfortable. I have a camper shell on the back and it looks really great with the truck.  I've towed a small trailer loaded with camping gear and a small motorcycle over the rockies...no problem but not a lot of pulling power. Excellent truck for the long haul.  Handles great on the highway and in normal conditions.  Not the best transportation for icy or snowy roads.  Is comfortable but not really built for tall or larger people.  Get good mileage...about 28-32 hwy.  I have really enjoyed my pickup and have recommended it over and over to friends and family.<br><br>
