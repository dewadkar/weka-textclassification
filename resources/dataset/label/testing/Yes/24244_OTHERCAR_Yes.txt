            My husband and I leased a new 98 Tahoe because I wanted a 4-wheel drive vehicle for the winter and we needed something heavy duty to pull our 27'travel trailer. The Tahoe handles great in the snow and it also pulls our trailer without a problem. The back seats fold down and allow us to haul our scuba tanks and gear comfortably. The payments to purchase a vehicle like this were too high for our budget, that's why we leased it for 2 years.

Within a 1 year period the rear axle seals were leaking and had to be replaced, the steering box seal and the idler pulley went bad and also had to be replaced. The leather on both front seats are wearing to the point that they are going to start ripping. When we showed the seats to the dealership, they told us that GM had put cheap leather on the seats and offered us two options: 1. Replace the leather panel that was bad. 
2.Or replace the seats completely. They told us the only thing wrong with replacing the panels, is that the colors might not match exactly, because the repairs are done by an after market company and not GM. My husband is worried about replacing the seats completely because of all of the electronic components.

UPDATE:Our Tahoe was taken to Baierl's again.. (5-31-00)
       1.The floor on the rear passanger side was damp and smelling musty:
         They checked for the leak and found that the seals around the 
         windows needed replaced.They also pulled the existing rug up to 
         dry the underneath.
       2. Replaced the lower cooler line which was leaking
       3. Power steering cap is being replaced because of a leak
       4. New oil tube will be installed- leak
       5. Replaced passenger outside mirror- falling off 
Sure, these were all fixed under warranty, but this truck only has 24,000 miles on it..We are very nervous about the 3 year warranty running out, and having to purchase an extended warranty.       <br><br>
