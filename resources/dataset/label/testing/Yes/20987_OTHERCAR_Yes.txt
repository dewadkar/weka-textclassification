            The RAV4 is a single vehicle capable of performing various tasks.  It is reliable enough to be used to commute daily, take a trip to the beach, or rummage through a little snow to reach the slopes.

The 4WD version is capable of attacking mild off-road terrain.  Although it is not as confident as a full blown off-road vehicle, it can be easily taken through snowy conditions without many worries.  The manual transmission comes with a center locking differential which helps with getting out of tight spots.

The gas mileage of this 4-cylinder gives it the ability to be taken through rush hour traffic much like a compact car would.  Its independent suspension also makes it handle and feel more like a compact car.

An optional tow hitch is also available as an option.  The hitch supports up to 1500 pounds for those that are looking for a way to pull along jet skis or to tow a trailer.  The hitch also adds to the styling of the vehicle and appeal of the rear.

There are many options to this vehicle.  For styling, the fender flares and sport side bars are a must.  The RAV4's fun styling is like no other on the market.

This vehicle has many features that make and break the car.  The fact that it is a 4-cylinder gives it the advantage over gas mileage but will be disadvantaged when it comes to acceleration.  Acceleration with the driver alone is a bit on the slow side, let alone trying to bring along four passengers and luggage.  An uphill trek can get a bit disturbing as the RAV4 shifts between 3rd and 4th gears and possibly 2nd.  Road noise is clearly present but is quiet enough to be ignored.

Its size can also be used to its advantage and disadvantage.  The space available is equivalent to five people and room for luggage for a weekend trip of snowboarding.  The rear seats are not the most friendliest place for bigger passengers.  If room for three is only needed, the RAV4 is more than perfect.  The rear seats also fold down for groceries or the transportation of personal items.

The RAV4 is capable of performing well in many areas.  The major downside is the lack of power.  For those more interested in commuting but have trips to the mountains in mind will find this vehicle more than adequate.  Long drives on fairly flat land is where this vehicle will consume very little gas when compared to bigger SUVs, such as its bigger sibling the 4Runner.<br><br>
