            When Digital cameras first hit the market a few years ago, I decided my price was under $300. When I saw an Ad for $299 at CompUSA, I decided it was time to buy. Most of the reviews have mentioned the battery life, and I'm sure this is a concern. I replaced the included batteries with the new Duracell Ultra batteries and I also found a flash card to PCMCIA adapter on the internet. You simply remove the flash card from the camera, plug the flash card into the PCMCIA adapter and it acts like a hard drive. You can copy the pictures to your hard drive and not use up battery life.

I have been into photography for many years, have a couple of 35 MM cameras and lenses, used to process my own black and whites (back in the 60's and 70's) and I do still enjoy doing some photo sessions playing with light and colors, but most of my photos now are snapshots of the kids, vacation shots and a few shots intended for the web. The HP C200 does 99% of what I want a camera to do with the added plus that I no longer have to pay for processing. And as long as I have my laptop with me, and I almost always do, I never run out of film.

I find the quality of the photos more than adequate for family snapshots and the flash just fair. The zoom feature is something I could do without, since I can use PC based software and do the same thing. The zoom is so cumbersome to engage that I don't really find it useful.

If you are a Mom or Dad and want to take pictures of the little ones and send them to relatives over the internet or post them on your home page, then you don't need to spend more than $299 for a camera. This is it! If you consider yourself a photographer and have ever used a light meter and consider backgrounds and shadows as an important part of your photos, this is not for you. In fact, digital is probably not going to help you at any price. For Disney World or the Little League games, this camera can't be beat.
