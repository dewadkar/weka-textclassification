            I am currently the owner of a 96 Eclipse RS.  I recently bought this vehicle in Feb. 2000.  I have been dreaming of this car since it's intro with this body style in 1995.  In anycase I bought this vehicle because I was able to scrounge up enough $$$ &amp; thought the price was too good to be true. The title skipping generations is just a physical comment about the first and third generation Eclipses, Talons &amp; Lasers (YUK TO BOTH)  DSM got it right on the second try (outside &amp; inside), let's pray for the fourth!!

I was looking for a 5 speed, any color and any year 1995-1999 with the proper mileage, that I could afford.  Those were my only pre-requisites.  I was browsing the local net and found a major dealership with 2 available.  Both at $9,995.00, one a blue 1995 with a sunroof and the other a Red 1996 with no sunroof. I took the blue on a test drive &amp; almost made my dsecision, but the salesman asked me if I wanted to take the red one for a test drive.  Ok.  You could feel the difference in the drive.  For paying the same price, &amp; getting a car that was a year newer with no sunroof, I went for it.

I brought my car home, it was missing some minor parts that I wasn't really concerned with (make sure U look the car over thoroughly before U buy)  Drivers side sunvisor clip was broken,windshield washer fluid cap was not there, drivers side recliner bar was broken, my spare tire was (and still isn't) locked down properly, the cardboard covering it was ripped, and of course no drivers manual (why do people not keep these with their cars, is there a money market out there for them?), &amp; take note of the lug nuts.  My car came with a special lug nut on each wheel that required a key, they key was also not with the car.  The special nuts had to be broken off and replaced.(with ones that do not match) That was what I ended up having wrong at first.  These problems were so minor to me for a car that I've always wanted.  So I bought the missing plastic parts ($6.00 for all), the dealership did my lug nuts (free), glued the cardboard covering the spare myself, and tied down the spare with rope (oh well, the only time it rattles is when I go over speed bumps hard.)  That's it. The car is physically beautiful, but wait I had one more problem.

When I would drive the car and apply the brakes after going 30 miles per hour or faster, the brake pedal would shake and start to vibrate up to the steering wheel.  This problem seemed worse some days and better others.  Sometimes the shaking got so bad that spare tire of mine would rattle and make my cd player (which didn't come with the car) skip.  I had a friend of mine take a look at my brakes.  After attempting with an air wrench to take off my lug nuts, they would not budge.  We flipped open the repair manual I bought and checked on the proper foot pounds for tires.  It suggested something like a max of 111.  My friends air gun could remove 200+.  THe VERY FIRST WARNING IN THE BOOK WAS lug nuts being on too tight can damage rotors.  Think we found our problem.  But let's continue.  It took my friend all of his manliness to remove the lug nuts on my car.  ALL were put way too tight.  A broken wrench, and 1 hour later all the tires were off my car.  The brakes looked fine.  Maybe my rims were bent.  Back went on the wheels &amp; a 5 minute test drive later proved that this did not help the problem.  

I then took my car into a very reliable mechanic who said the rotors were warped.  They resurfaced the rotors (for a measly $20.00) and I have a new car again.  No problems since and now it's my dream come true. 

I would highly recommend this car to responsible drivers who want a sports car.  You could easily get in trouble with this car.  (There is a bet in my office going for how long it's going to take me to get a speeding ticket)  I love the sprint challenges I have at stoplights.  Eat my dust.  If you know how to change your gears, you won't be disappointed with the 5-speed...Don't get an automatic, and if you don't know how to drive one, learn, you will thank me!!<br><br>
