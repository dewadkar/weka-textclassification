                First let me explain that I work for an auto shipping yard, that handles exsclusively G.M. products. I can safely say that I have driven everything that G.M. manufacturers, and so far about 300,00 vehicles.
   I have always been a dedicated G.M. owner.  My experience with imports, was limited to riding in friends cars in the late 70's. These were usually pieces of junk.
So I did have a definite bias against japanese cars.
   Last year when my wife needed a new car, on a whim we took out a Camry. I was shocked, it rode like a buick, was as quiet as a Cadillac, and the 4 banger under the hood was a responsive as any standard v-6 that G.M. makes.
My wife liked the car but opted to return to her Soccer Mom roots and bought a Buick Rendezvous.
   The Camry however was still on my mind. This year when I finally needed a new car, (my 91 Caprice was finished), I went out to look at Camrys for myself, a hard thing to do for a dedicated G.M car buyer. 
   I opted for a 2003 Camry SE, Salsa Red, with a 5 speed.
The firmer ride, 4 wheel disc brakes, and charcoal interior sold me on the SE package. The Car handles remarkably well. I hit the on ramp entrance to the highway daily, throw the car into the curve, and am doing easily 75 mph hour by the mid way point. The tires (michelin) don't complain one bit, and the motor is hardly working.
   The trunk is huge, the seats supportive, the stereo wonderful, the wind noise is non-existent, and it goes along way on a little gas.
   My salesman didn't recommend the purchase of an extended warranty !!!  Every domestic car I have ever bought they always take you into a another room after you buy the car, and begin to tell me what a piece of junk , I have just bought and how exspensive it is to repair, and how I am going to end up in the poor house if I don't buy this extended warranty. Which I always decline anyway, but wow, what a feeling not to be, force fed this garbage.
  Bottom line, I have had the car for 5 months, 6000 miles and 0 problems. I am a very happy import owner.
