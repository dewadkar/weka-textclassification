            After reading various web reviews of Panasonic's 1.3 megapixel PalmCam I had mixed feelings. Some of the samples I found online were stunning yet others appeared to lack the color saturation and clarity that I was looking for.

Two factors prompted me to go ahead and buy the PPVSD4090 anyhow:

1. The price was right (under $500 plus there's a $100 mail in rebate through the end of Dec. 2000).
2. The storage capacity of the 120mg SuperDisk far exceeded anything else on the market save Sony's CD-RW cameras which retail over $1,000. 

Here are the Pros:

� The PalmCam can take clear pictures of small objects (approximately 2.5 inches) from about 6" away�even though it lacks a macro mode.
� The camera is designed in an intuitive fashion�meaning that the controls/features are easy to use.
� The SuperDisk can function as a floppy/super drive�an especially useful feature for those of us who own Macs�which no longer come with a built in floppy drive. (You can use the USB to transfer the photos to your HD from the SuperDisk.)
� The PalmCam feels solid and well built.

Here are the Cons:

� The PalmCam lacks a traditional viewfinder.
� The LCD is vulnerable to scratches. If you use the shoulder strap on the camera be sure it doesn't make contact with rivets or buttons on clothing. (Too bad Panasonic didn't package the camera with one of those transparent glueless decals over the screen�if left on, the plastic overlay could serve as an inexpensive way to protect the LCD without greatly diminishing the clarity of the screen.)
� If you leave the battery pack in the camera or on the charger too long�even for short periods�it can damage the battery.


In response to criticism in other reviews:

1. The camera is too heavy. Yes, the camera is somewhat larger and heavier but this is something that most people should be able to adapt to.
2. The color saturation is not the best. This may be true (see pcphotoreview.com to view sample images from many digital cameras). On the other hand, there seems to be more subtlety of tone captured�which is to say that the pictures appear more natural (true to life). If you want vivid color rather than natural color, a couple tweaks in a program like Photoshop should eliminate the problem.
3. Clarity isn't as good as other digital cameras on the market. For a 1.3 megapixel camera, the pictures, in my opinion, are quite sharp. I own a point-and-shoot film-based camera that doesn't even come close to what this digital camera can put out. Unless you're a  professional, you probably won't be disappointed.


Other factors to consider when purchasing a digital camera:

� Fact: As of this writing, no other digital camera claims to rival a high quality professional film-based camera in the hands of a professional photographer. If you want perfection, a traditional camera is still the best way to go�at least until the technology catches up.
� Pictures for Web: If you buy a camera that has a resolution capacity greater than 1.3 megapixels (1200x960) with the intent of placing most of your pictures on the web or in an e-mail, you may not have to spend as much as you think you will. The reason is that photos and graphics on the web are often produced to download quickly�just 72dpi on average. And because of the limitations of the typical computer monitor, you may not benefit from that 3 or 4 megapixel resolution anyhow. 
� Pictures for Print: If you invest in a camera that has a greater overall resolution than that of the printer you intend to use, you may not be able to see what you paid for. If you own or plan to purchase a digital photo printer, however, paying the extra money for a an ultra high-resolution camera may be worth the additional cost. Many inkjet printers have a maximum resolution of 1200x720, 1400x720 or 1200x12000, so purchase your camera with the limitations of your particular output device in mind.
