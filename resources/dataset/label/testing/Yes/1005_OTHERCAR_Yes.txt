            The styling is great. Very classy and upscale for a car in this price range. The lines are very "clean". We opted for the XR w/4wd and the sport packages in Black.  The Matrix is such a head-turner. We both like the fact that it has some of the SUV appeal without being obnoxious and/or overbearing.  We enjoy the confidence we feel behind the wheel, both in Toyota's reliability, and in the sturdy, well built feel of the Matrix.  The Matrix is the ultimate cross-over people mover.  The only curious thing we've found is that certain compact discs have a tendency to slip when braking moderately hard. We imagine it's b/c some discs are thinner than others.  The cd player also doesn't play cd recordables, like some home stereos. 

My wife and I purchased our Matrix two days after its' February debut. We were sold upon seeing the commercials; in love upon our first drive of it.  We are both in our early 30s and looking to start a family. We live in the city, and we are working artists, so a typical wagon, or god-forbid a minivan, was not on our radar. The Matrix is very "us".
