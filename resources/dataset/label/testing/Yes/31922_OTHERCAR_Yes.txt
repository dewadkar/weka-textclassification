            The 2001 Subaru Forester S, Premium Edition, is a winning vehicle.  Drawing on useful aspects of SUV�s and tailoring them to a compact car, it provides everything most people need, without the surplus bulk or negative (environmental) connotations.  The vehicle handles well, as nimble as the compact sedan it is based on (Impreza).  AWD is now standard on all Subaru�s.  All Wheel Drive is a big selling point, especially in the northeast part of the U.S.  Subaru�s AWD system is a bit more comprehensive and rugged than other companies.  ABS and FOUR airbags, along with strategic crumple zones, and overall crash worthiness complete the safety package.  Also, for 2001, all 5 passengers have 3-point seatbelts.  Remote locks are a nice touch too.

The Forester has been a best seller since its introduction in 1997.   As a result, there aren�t many buyer incentives or rebates going around.  It pays to shop around, as the two nearest dealers to my home had significant asking price differences.  Essentially, the Forester is still the same vehicle as when it was introduced.  Some cosmetic changes exist, such as more rounded headlights, and a larger taillight display.  The 4-cylinder engine puts out a few more horsepower.  Acceleration, as well as handling and breaking are quite respectable.

Subaru Forester comes in L and S trim levels.  The big difference is in the seat fabric.  L is tweedy, S is plush velour.  A worthwhile extra is the winter package, which adds 2 stage heated front seats, heated side view mirrors, and a windshield wiper deicer.  The Forester I purchased is an S, with the Premium Package.  The big whoop-de-do with the Premium package is one of the biggest moonroof you will ever see in a passenger car.  It just about extends to the back seat!  Single color exterior (white, black, red, or gold), and gold tone alloy wheels signify Premium trim level.  All other Forester�s have two tone paint: the lower body cladding is silvery gray.  The S Premium also has a rear differential, to help regulate power to the tires.  It works in conjunction with the full time AWD system.

The interior of the Forester is comfortable, if not spacious.  The front seats track backward to allow for tall people, at the expense of back seat passengers.  Controls are logically spaced out, although the fog light and deicer switch are obscured by the directional signal.  Cubby holes abound: two on each front door, one on each back door; a center console, 2 in the cargo area, and three hidden ones under the floor!  The spare tire is easy to get at (no crawling underneath the car to get at it).  Climate control works well.

Music is provided by an AM/FM cassette player with in-dash 6 CD player.  It is kind of odd to feed 6 CD�s into the dash, as you might wonder were they are going.  Gone is the old metal antenna, for which I am grateful.  The antenna is now built into the back side window.  I have noticed no interference with reception.  The Forester has 6 speakers.  All of them are covered by hard plastic grids, which do nothing to enhance the sound quality.

A big disappointment with the Premium package is the unavailability of leather surfaces.  You gain side impact air bags, but loose leather in the trade.  I don�t see why, as the Legacy has side airbags and leather.  There are some aftermarket companies that can retrofit your Forester with leather, but be warned:  Subaru will consider your warranty void.  I asked the dealer.  A small quibble, to be sure, but for the money I spent, it would have been nice.  Another weird thing is the �wood trim� option.  It costs almost $300 and it is plastic!  

From a driver's point of view, the Forester is competent and displays trustworthy handling.  Being built off a car platform, instead of a truck, the Subaru Forester drives like a sedan.  The dreaded SUV center of gravity isn't as much of a concern.  The Forester is the only SUV I know of that isn't federally mandated to provide rollover-warning stickers to the buyer.  On normal pavement, the Forester hums, not hinting at its 4-cylinder lineage.  True, acceleration isn't going to push you into the back seat; however, it is more than adequate.  Breaking is good, not too grabby, and not too soft.  The Forester works better off-road than some of its competitors, but I would not push it into Sherwood Forest on a wet day.  Steering is precise and responsive.  On highways, I have not felt pushed into the breakdown lane.  Actually, I have been impressed with the speed to r.p.m. ratio.  Once the driver's seat is set up for your maximum comfort, the Forester is a capable cruiser, and sturdy hauler.  The engine is a boxster design, which enhances the driving experience.

In many, many respects the Subaru Forester is proving to be a worthwhile vehicle.  Fuel economy is far better than for a full sized SUV, and the smaller engine is ample to propel you wherever you need to go.


I just brought the Forester in for its first oil change.  It wasn't a very &quot;feel good&quot; experience.  I spent almost $30 and didn't get so much as a paper floor mat, never mind cleaned windshields.  Even Jiffy Lube runs the Hoover before returning the car!

A good friend was interested in purchasing a Subaru, so he submitted a bid online.  The dealership called him up at work the next day and was so rude to him about his bid amount that he hung up.  Subaru lost a sale, sadly.  My lackluster service experience may be a concern down the road if the Forester needs repair.  Let's hope it doesn't and let's hope the dealerships focus more on good customer service!
