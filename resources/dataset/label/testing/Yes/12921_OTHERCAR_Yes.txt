            I bought one of these in 1994 when I graduated from high school, figuring that it would make decent transportation and save on insurance, being a four door.  For the first couple of years, it was an excellent car.  The 3.1 L V6 delivers on performance and the handling was great.  The interior is nicely appointed, even if it is a bit sparse, but what do you expect from a lower-midrange from GM?  Driving the long distances between college and home a few times a month, it performed well.  The seats were comfortable and the A/C did an excellent job fending off the hot Texas sun.  In fact, after running for a couple of hours in 98 degree+ weather, the A/C could get so cold that I could see my breath.  The factory audio system is pretty good, though I later switched from the factory cassette deck to a Pioneer CD changer.  However, while this may sound apocryphal, at about 50,000 miles, it began to give me all kinds of trouble.  Tie rods went out, electrical system started failing (it &quot;ate&quot; four alternators in two years), paint started flaking, seats began falling apart, and engine mounts broke left and right.  I still drive this car and, when it's not suffering from any major mechanical maladies, it still performs well at over 100,000 miles.  <br><br>
