            My wife and I own a 1996 Toyota Camry Sedan. We are very pleased with this vehicle. We purchased this car back in 1998 with 19,000 miles on it. The car now has over 100,000 miles on it as of June 1, 2002. We have never had to make any major repairs on this car and my wife drives it every day to work. We believe that it drives just as well now as it did when we first purchased it. We get about 22 to 24 mpg city and about 26 to 28 mpg hwy.
Our only complaint about this car is the cup holders. There is only enough room for two drinks and the cup holder accessory is flimsy. The drinks spill easily. Other than this flaw, the car is close to perfect. I would recommend this car to anyone.
