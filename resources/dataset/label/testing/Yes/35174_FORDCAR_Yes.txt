            When I bought my first car, a 1993 Ford Escort LXI, I was not quite sure how dependable and long-lasting it would be. I had that car for 3 years and when I finally traded it in, it had almost 200 thousand miles on it. I made some repairs on it, but nothing major like the transmission or anything. It lasted me through  the years of carrying 8 friends all over town all night long to find parties and other places to get us through the weekend. I now own a 1999 Ford Escort SE.I  have had this car about three months now and it has been great. It is no speed demon, but it has a little pick up speed and it definitely gets you where you need to go. The exterior and the interior is really nice. The  inside is roomy and that means a lot. I really do not like travelling in cars that you feel cluttered in. This car would be great for anyone such as teenagers, families, or the elderly. I think you would like this car. If you have a chance, a least test-drive one.<br><br>
