            I love the Jeep Wrangler, but there are so many of them around.  I wanted something fun like the Wrangler that was perhaps a bit more functional & friendly.

So I bought a used 1998 Isuzu Amigo 3.2L V6 4WD with a 5 Speed, sun roof and soft top.  I could have lived without the in dash CD changer though it works great as far as I can tell.  I guess mine came with pretty much all the bells and whistles.

My family and I have taken our Amigo on long vacation trips to the beach a couple times and it's performed flawlessly, on and off road.  It has plenty of power for good highway speeds (more than fast enough).  And the 4WD was a lot of fun on the beach.  I had no problems following a buddy of mine, a happy Wrangler driver, into the soft sands of North Carolina's Outerbanks.

My wife's been very happy with it too.  The first time she had to use 4WD in the snow, she was very impressed with the results.
