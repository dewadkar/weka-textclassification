            Wow!  What can I say?  These cars last longer than most cars, and they outlast any car in their price range.  I have owned many compact cars, and these are the only ones that don't develope rattles within a short time of the purchase.  I am still driving a 1989 Honda Accord, and it runs great, and still feels solid.  That is the difference between these cars and most other compacts, the quality.  Most other cars feel good when you test drive them, but then they start to rattle shortly after the purchase.  With every Honda Accord that I have had, the car has lasted a long time, all the while feeling very solid.  I once had one with over 200,000 miles on it.  I currently have 3, one that is a 1989, one that is a '92, and one that is a '99, and they are excellent cars, I would recommend these cars for anyone in the market.<br><br>
