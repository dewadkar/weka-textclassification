            Hey, yes I am an owner of an '88 trooper! I am -- years old and I love my car. It is 4x4 and I love it! I think that it has good standards and all. The only thing I dislike about my car is it is top-heavy, but even that is not that bad, you just have to be careful around these mountainous roads in North Carolina. Email me about what you think of '88 troopers or any year of the Isuzu Trooper!<br><br>
