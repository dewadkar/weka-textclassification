            After having my share of old cars with hidden headaches I decided I would take the plunge and buy my first new car. While on vacation in New Jersey my husband and I rented the 1999 Mazda protege LX and fell in love with it. It had a smooth ride, lots of leg room and a huge trunk. On our tight budget I was hesitant that this car might not be in our reach but was pleasantly surprised to discover this adorable  compact 4 door was around the 11,000.00 to 15,000.00 range.We were able to to get the L/X at the D/X price at an interest rate of only 5% thanks to a Mazda promotion.
If you enjoy traveling the cruise control and Cd player are added bonuses.
There are dual airbags for added safety and the keyring has a panic button. I recommend this car for most families looking for a great car
with dependability and good gas mileage. For those who like extra tin
to steer or monster wheels you may want to pass this one up.So if you are in the market for a new car test drive this one first, I did and fell in love.<br><br>
