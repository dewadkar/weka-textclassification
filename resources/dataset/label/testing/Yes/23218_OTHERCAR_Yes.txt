                 I have wanted to buy a digital camera for about as long as digital cameras have been on the market.  Naturally at first they were quite costly, images were not perfect, and there were no standards to speak of.  Finally we have improvement on all of these things including cost.

     After comparing prices, image quality, functionality, and (did I say price?), for the longest time, I was finally sold on the Kodak DX3500 Digital Camera.  The DX3500 is 1 of 5 different DX Cameras in the DX line.  This is quite nice, as Kodak has added the Kodak Easy Share System both in the camera as well as online.  These allows you to quickly and efficiently transfer images to your computer (most of the time with the push of one button if you have the dock), or by clicking on one button after the software automatically starts up, when the camera is turned on and connected to your computer.  All 5 cameras in the DX line use the same Dock, via a Dock Template.  The Dock provides a perfect storage place for your camera, keeps your batteries/battery pack charged, and has the one touch image transfer button.  I highly recommend the Dock.  However, if you are price conscious, you do not need the dock.  Without it, you connect your supplied USB cable to your computer and to your Camera (I leave my cable connected to my computer all the time, thus eliminating half that step), turn on the camera, and the software automatically reads your camera and brings up the Transfer software.  It even tells you the condition of your battery.  Although it does not tell you in a percentage how much of a charge is left, but at least it tells you something.  Then all you have to do is click TRANSFER, and you are set.

     The best thing I can tell you about this camera is it's total ease of use.  A friend of mine bought a digital camera last year.  1.3Mp, paid $400.00 for it, and he still has trouble figuring out how to use it.  I honestly cannot remember exactly what brand it is right now.  I did try to figure it out without a manual one-night right after he bought it, and I could not even get it to take a picture. It had too many buttons, with no descriptions.  Anyway, the Kodak DX3500 is made for people who want more than just a basic web camera, we want a full-featured digital camera, but yet don't want to go to school to learn to use it.  I had this camera totally set-up and figured out without cracking the plastic on the manual.  I eventually opened the manual to see if I missed anything, and of course I did, but only how to zoom.  Everything is self-explanatory.  I am going over to another friends house tonight to help him figure out how to get his images off his camera and onto his computer.  He just bought a 1.3Mp Toshiba.

     Here's another thought!  Kodak made the camera?  Isn't Kodak the leader in Photo equipment, picture paper, film, etc?  That was my thought at least, and I don't think I was misled.  The software is also designed for the user that does not want to have to learn the world.  Simple one click editing for Read eye removal, picture enhancement, and other fun features too.  Now I am more of an experienced user, so I will probably end up purchasing some more sophisticated software for Photo Editing.  But it does a nice job, and printing software reminds me of going to JC Penny's or Sears for getting Photo's taken.  Just select whether you want Wallet size, 5x7, 4x6 3x5, 8x10, and how many per page, and there you go!  Simple!!!

     Only 1 downside to this particular model is there is no Optical Zoom.  Look at any camera you are thinking of purchasing and find out if the zoom being reported is optical or digital.  A lot of them are a combination of both.  My personal opinion is digital zoom is useless and not to be used, as you loose image quality when you do use it.  This camera has a 3X digital zoom.  At 2X the image looses too much sharpness.  The DX3900 for instance or the DX3600 have a 2X Optical Zoom and a 3X digital.  Combined gives 6X.  Again, I would not use the digital.  Optical zoom is the actual lens zooming in and out like you are used to seeing on a normal camera.  Digital zoom is digital enhancing inside the camera.  It sucks believe me.  But for Optical zoom, you will be paying for it.

     I guess I could go on and on about this camera as it is really the best buy I have found.  And the image quality is fantastic.  One other detail, you will need to be able to charge your batteries (alkaline batteries are not supported or recommended), so either purchase the Dock or the Kodak rapid charger.

     I purchased my camera and 64Mb Compact Flash Memory card, including shipping for only $236.00 from www.buy.com.  The Camera was $188.00, the memory card was $31.00.  I saved $50.00 off Bestbuy's price.  Check it out!
