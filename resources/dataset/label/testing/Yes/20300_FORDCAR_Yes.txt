            We just bought the new Ford Explorer Sport Trac just a little over a month ago. This is a FUN vehicle. I've never seen heads turn so much and I usually buy vehicles when they're just released. It's a head turner!

� We bought it, because we need a truck of some kind. We are antiquers, and we are remodelers. If you need a large truck, forget this one, because the bed is only about 4 feet square. We have hauled with the liftgate open a 5.5 foot antique desk. We traded in a 1997 Ford F-150 that we loved, but we were so high on resale value that we traded.
� What I love: The 4 doors. The seat fabric (gabardine). The floors are rubber matting with cocoa fiber like floor mats. You can literally go to the beach in this and hose it out at the car wash (We do) It has a power rear window with vent feature, and there are two power points in the rear  cargo bed. There are 8 tiedown davits on the sides of the bed.
Two behind seat storage compartments. There is a removable bag that matches the seats that fits into the console area that we keep the phone and filofax in. It's got white instrument dials and an indash 6 cd changer that you CANNOT make skip.
� We are averaging about 20 on the highway. Remember it is an SUV.
Seats are VERY comfortable even on long trips. Drivers is power.
