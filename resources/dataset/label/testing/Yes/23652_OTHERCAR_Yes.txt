            I have owned this camera for about 3 months and have had great success with it.  The picture quality is superb and it has just enough features for a person like me (who has a family and limited tinkering time).

I want to correct the critics of the battery life on this (and all) digital cameras.  <b>They all eat alkaline batteries - period.  Do not use them unless you are in a bind.</b>  The rechargeable batteries that come with this unit work very well given this is a digital camera.  I would suggest going to Target and buying another set of these with a charger, just so you can always have a backup.

If you have children, this camera is great, it snaps fast pictures and the autofocus is very speedy (it has never caused me to lose a shot).  I have tried other cameras (especially Canon and Sony) where the autofocus take FOREVER.  Which I am sure would cause you to lose more than one spontaneous picture or two.

I will say I hated the fact that Fuji came out with its own memory modules.  However, from what has been told to me, this is a faster memory architecture and provides short time between photos.  I just do not like proprietary stuff (i.e. Sony Memory Stick) but it is a one-time investment.

The picture quality is basically awesome both indoors and out.  Pictures are bright, clear and colorful with little blurring or washout.  This is the strongest point of the camera besides the 3X optical zoom.  

As far as the software is concerned, I can take it or leave it.  If you have Windows XP, simply hook up the camera, turn on the download mode and let Windows XP prompt you for the drivers.  Then use the Windows XP utilities to download and save the pictures.  You can then edit them with some other tool.

Note this unit identical to the Finepix 2600 except the memory modules are different.
