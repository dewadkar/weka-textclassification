            Prior to purchasing this camera for my husband, I did extensive research on the internet.  My original intent was to purchase the DC280 model, as all of the research I found recommended this model.  However, I later learned when I went to buy it, that the DC280 was the older model.  Still, I was impressed with everything I read about the DC280, so I purchased its successor, the DC3400.  

My husband loves it.  It is easy to use, takes great pictures and is a great all-around camera for the price.  

The main reason I purchased this camera is because of the features you would normally find on a more expensive camera, such as the 2 megapixel resolution, the 2x zoom which has an additional 3x zoom, and the easy to use on-screen menu.  

So far, the only disappointment with this camera, and it is a minor one at that, is that in the manual it refers to a beeping feature for feedback purposes which can be turned on or off.  This feature is actually non-existent on this camera.  Apparently it was a misprint.  However, I was further disappointed to e-mail Kodak on their web site and have never heard back from them regarding this matter.  

Even if you are buying your first digital camera, it is worth it to spend a little bit more to get the extra features that this camera has.<br><br>
