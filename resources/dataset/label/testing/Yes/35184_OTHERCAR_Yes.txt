            Hello again all.  Firstly, I would like to thank all of you that read my review of the Range Rover and most of all, I would like to thank the two members that rated the review. &quot; I thank you&quot;.

Also, I would like to apologize for my extended writer's block, I sincerely appreciate your patience.  I ask that you again excercise more patience and follow me to the end of my saga, and to the conclusion of my quest to have this marquee sitting my very own drive way.

Well, I have since tested more Range Rovers than Prince Charles has said Camilla...  (Please do not be offended).  During the last month, I decided to take the Range Rover 4.0 through it's paces.  And so to the chagrin of a local dealer, I went for a REAL test drive of an SUV.  

On the road, I found this tuxedoed Suburban to be rather lagish on the acceleration.  It was quite sluggish to pick up from the light.  I consoled myself with the thought that I was considering this automobile for its elegance, its off-road prowess and not for being a Green light burner.  So, I was able to look down at the suped up Hondas and Mustangs,and say &quot;Haa, mine rides higher than your's&quot; or &quot;Mine can go places you can only dream off&quot;.  After about a four mile road trial, I found that true to prior reviews and rumors, the Range Rover did handle much better that the predeccessor.  It did not roll around as much as the previous Range Rover and I felt I was in good control of the car.  Also noticeable was the abscense of shudder at the wheel when I hit bumps.  I had began to think this was a norm for all SUV's.  The Rover handled the road and bumps with much aplomb, as expected from Her Majesty's 
off-roading chariot.

And so with this done, I decided to try it out in the environment that had earned this remarkable vehicle it's legendary reputation.  Now please bear in mind that I am in no way an expert off-roader.  Off-roading to me thus far has been rolling down the ramp to launch a boat, or going up a man made trail into the woods.  However, I decided to trust in the Goddess Brittannia and see if her nation's product really could rule the outdoors like she did the waves.

I chose a local hill to climb up in the Range Rover.  I was heady with excitement and fear as I began.  And also the fact that the second mortgage application had not yet come back approved made me extremely cautious.  I selected the second gate gearing on the Rover and put it into a low gear.  I then decided that to add to the element of fun, I would raise the Rover to the limits of it technologically intriguing suspension.  Can you say Geronimo ?!?!   What a ride, even though wild may not be the best way to describe it.  It was almost sedate, not because the vehicle lacked performance, but because it accomplished this task with such aplomb.  It almost seemed to be daring me with,&quot;Is that your best shot?&quot;  I then decided to go down-hill....go figure.  I turned the Royal Chariot around and then proceeded downhill.  As I approached this maneuver, I could not help but think back to a visit to West Africa where I visited the Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria.  We had climbed to the top of this mountain, and all this in a car.  On the way, I realized that I had what it took to be a convert to any religion's whose God would answer my prayer that day.  Coming downhill, brakes squealing and gears trying desperately to hold on to traction is no fun.  Anyway, I digress.  On the downhill, the Range Rover again yawned at my attempts to show it up.  It literally crawled its way down, I found myself actually getting impatient sometimes with the car.  However, I was in utter awe of this marquee and the way it was handling.  Throughout my test drive, I was amazed that I was experiencing first hand everything that had made this remarkable vehicle legendary.  Mud pools, over rocks and tree stumps, this baby handled it with amazing competence.  Mind you, I was putting the Range Rover through the kind of outdoors driving most people would not do in a $60,000 automobile, let alone to even think of taking of the beaten trail.  Also, consider that this was a test car and the bank had not yet said &quot;yes' to my second mortgage application.  

I came back from the test drive with a BIG childish grin on my face.  Her Majesty's Chariot came back with a face full of mud, side painted in earthy tones, and tires that barely showed any black coloring on the rubber.  The salesperson however had a look of horror, bemusement and disbelief on his face.  It did not help that I patted him on the shoulder and told him what wonderful car the Range Rover was and that I was not buying it that day :-).  I mean come on, my application was still pending.

I did go back to the dealership once I was ready to drive off my dream.  As I was nearing the end of this saga, I was still a little hesitant due to the RR's lagish performance.  I knew that I would not do that much of roading, I was more concerned about road pep.  The salesperson suggested I try out a 4.6 model of the Range Rover.  With images of me going back to the bank to re-apply for a bigger loan, I strapped on a beautiful White Range Rover 4.6.  I would like to think it is because I might get the White car dirty that Pierre decided to go with me this time, not because I might challenge the car again.  The car handled much the same as its stable mate.  However, there was power now.  Oh there was power, power, power.  I was able to leave the lights at a very respectable pace, and in the sport mode, the transmission was able to haul this tonnage of British pedigree with brisk aplomb.  And so, I had now found a dream that I could live with,  The question was whether I could afford it.

Pierre was able to find me a 1998 4.6, with about 38,000 miles on it.  It did stretch my budget a bit by a few more thousand, but I tell ya.... I am one happy Angeleno.  My dream sits in the driveway, I did not have to use all of the remortgae loan and I and James Bond are cruising the LA freeways.  <br><br>
