            I Love it!  this product wortks fabulous.  I needed a digital camera for my work on E-bay.  I take pictures of Fenton Art Glass and you wouldn't beleive the crystal clarity.  Let's fae it, Glass is hard to photograph.  Not with this Camera. It hooks up directly to your computer and you just download the images.  How easy is that?  The Sost ware is VERY Easy to use. My seven year old knows how.  Although, you do get a little sick of the Bird every time you start the Software. :)  Poor Birdy.  

Poloroid provides WONDEFUL Customer Service and is willing to help you in anyway.  I even used this camera for my Best Friends Wedding!!  Fanatical!  Highly Reccomended at a low cost!!!  Latly, prepare to plug it in.  The batteries only last for a few pictures.<br><br>
