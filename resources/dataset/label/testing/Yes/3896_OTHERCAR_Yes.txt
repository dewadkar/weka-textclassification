            We just bought a 1994 Plymouth Voyager. We bought it because our old car was going to need a new engine and it made sense to get this one instead. I had been wanting a bigger automobile since I had baby #2. Things were just too tight in our Ford Probe. We needed more room and definitely more doors.

What I love about this Van is that it has enough space for us. It would seat 7 passengers, not that we need that many, but it is available. We have space up front so that we are not to squished together. It drives very easily and is not too big to park or anything.

What I hate about this van, the trunk is not very big. I wish it had more room. But it will hold our double stroller and that's about it. Also, we have the very basic model and so we don't have automatic door locks and no automatic windows. I will miss that part from our old car. Also, this van eats gas like there's no tomorrow. But with all the negatives, I think its worth it because we needed the extra room and its wonderful.

This van drives very smoothly. I don't hear any bad sounds. It is a very quiet drive. It is so easy to drive, its a perfect size for me.

I think this would be perfect for any parent who needs more space than their car offers. I think this is a wonderful van. I am so happy and excited that we bought it!<br><br>
