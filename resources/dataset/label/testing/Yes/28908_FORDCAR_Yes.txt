            The Ford Explorer is one of the best sport utilities out there and I love the one that my dad has.  He has a 1995 For explorer and he drives it every where and it works alot.  The only thing that we have had to do to it was change the oil a couple of times and change the spark plugs once. That is it, we havn't had to do anything else to it.  It always passes SMOG like it was nothing.  Every member of my family loves this truck.  It rides like it isn't even going anywhere and you can hardly tell that the motor is running when it is one.  It also has very nice acceleration for a truck like this.  But you really don't need it in this thing because it can haul a lot of weight.  Even though it isn't a real truck it can still haul alot.  Over all this is one of the best things to ever come out other than the Mustang.  I would recommend this to everybody.<br><br>
