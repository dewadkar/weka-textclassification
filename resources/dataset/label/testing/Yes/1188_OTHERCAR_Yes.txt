            I have been driving this rental Dodge Neon for the past three months (and possibly longer if iMotors.com can't get me a car - they are now promising delivery tomorrow) so I feel fairly well qualified to write a review.

To begin with, I was handed this Neon as my only choice when the car I owned (see my review of the Chrysler LeBaron GTC Convertible) was totaled (Ok, I admit it... I wrecked the car!) Anyway, I thought the Neon was a joke and really tried to hate it. Unfortunately, like fungus, this car really grows on you.

It is only a V-4, but somehow I am generally able to hold my own with the maniacs on Northern California's freeways (Ok, I admit it too, I am one of those maniacs). I decided to crank it up to 100 and it held together, better than probably the LeBaron! It had a smooth acceleration and didn't shake or rattle at the high speed.

The handling is pretty good too. It is about the smallest size car that you would want power steering for and the steering is ok. Not precision, but definitely passable. The same thing goes for brakes. Not too soft, not too hard, they do a good job.

As far as room, the back seat is about as roomy as any of the compacts that claim to seat 5 (i.e. if you are over 5 feet tall, don't try to sit there). However, the trunk has a lot of room (perhaps I am just used to the tiny space in a convertible, but it is still nice).

Even the sound system is acceptable for this car. I won't be able to blast the guy next to me at a stoplight, but I can still get a decent sound and actual hear stereo and bass effects.

Finally, the cooling system (and heating too) is more than adequate for this car. Even when it got over 110 here, I was able to keep cool without a problem. The defrosters worked promptly as well.

The only flaw I could see was the somewhat cramped cockpit (I am 5'11 and huggable size [guys can get away with that!]) and I was a bit cramped, but it wasn't bad. I would guess if you are over 6'2 or 300 lbs, this is probably not the car for you.

You should get features like power windows, but then maybe I am just too lazy to roll them down.

Not sure about maintenance, but in two months all I had was a flat tire (I swear it wasn't my fault!)

Bottom line - you can certainly do worse than the Neon, so don't turn it down if you are offered one.<br><br>
