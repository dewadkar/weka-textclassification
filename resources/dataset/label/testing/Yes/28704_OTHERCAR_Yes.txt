            I purchased a 2001 Dodge Neon ACR in June 2002, and have enjoyed driving ever since.  Unlike the base model Neons running around, the ACR has a 150-horsepower magnum 4-cylinder engine and closer gear ratios.  And unlike it's magnum-powered brother, the R/T, the ACR is actually set up from the factory for performance driving.  

The ACR features dynamic adjustable struts, which allow you to stiffen or soften the suspension at each wheel.  This makes it possible to try to achieve a good bias for autocross.  I say "try" because the ACR, like most front-drive cars, has a tendency to oversteer.  I have found that it performs well for street driving with all four struts backed off two complete turns from full stiffness.  This is approximately the stiffness of a new SRT-4.

Most of you Epinions users' complaints are "hey, performance isn't everything, tell us how the car is in everyday driving."  So here you go:  The Neon ACR in its optimal suspension setup is a rather rough riding vehicle.  Since the tires stick to the road so well, the car has a tendency to follow all the imperfections of the road surface, such as truck tire grooves and potholes.  The car does not run on 87 octane, and requires premium fuel for its powerful engine.

The free-flowing dual exhaust and the dual-stage intake manifold generate a lot of noise in the cabin when revved to high RPM's. Since the engine is so high-strung, the car accelerates quickly, and can be jerky if you are attempting to vary your speed in traffic by leaving it in a lower gear at high RPM's.  The ACR can hold three passengers comfortably, but a fifth can feel squeezed in when sitting on the raised middle seat.  The car lacks power windows as a weight-saving measure, and the driver is required to crank the windows by hand.

All in all, this car is great for the weekend autocross enthusiast, or the young driver looking to lose his license in a blaze of 93 octane unleaded glory while slaughtering a Civic Si in a street race.  If you're looking at a Neon ACR as a family sedan and grocery getter, don't.  Leave these fun cars for someone who will appreciate them.
