            I bought my 1995 BMW 530i used when it was two years old. This is my second five series, my prior car was a BMW 528e which I had for 11 years.  My 1995 530i is a 3.0 litre 8 cylinder engine.  My car has a manual transmission and the car is amazing to drive.  I drove an automatic and there is no comparison. The manual transmission is the only way to go-it is a totally different car.  This car is fast, handles perfectly, and is quite luxurious.  I have had an electrical problem with this car (I also had a similar problem with my prior BMW) The only other problem is that if you let the car sit for more than a week the battery will drain out-I'm not sure why this happens, but I've heard from several other BMW owners that have had similar problems.  The premium sound system that came factory installed is excellent.  Other than the electric problem, the car has been perfect and it is a joy to drive everyday.  In fact, I can't imagine any other car that I'd rather have (except for maybe a BMW 540i-although the 530i has more than enough horsepower for anyone driving in the United States).<br><br>
