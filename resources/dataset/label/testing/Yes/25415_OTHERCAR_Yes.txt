            I purchased my Buick Park Ave. on August 1999. The reason for buying was the roominess and comfortable ride. I had rented one in Florida in March and loved the way the car performed. 
Another reason was the the courteous treatment from the dealership where I purchased the car. There was not the usual high pressure I have had at other GM dealers. 
The only problem I have noticed with the car are the windshield wipers.
Today in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the weather was light snow and around 20 degrees. Normal weather for this time of the year. I have never noticed much of a problem with ice buildup on the wipers on past vehicles I have had, but the wipers on the Park Avenue freeze up to easily. Although the blower fan is on windshield, it does not do a satisfactory task of keeping the blades free of ice. 
I would like to hear from other snowbelt owners to see if this is a problem with their wipers and how they dealt with the problem. 
Thanks for letting me air my winter wiper woes.
