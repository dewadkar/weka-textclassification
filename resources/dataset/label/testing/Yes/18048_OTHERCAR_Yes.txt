            What a car!  I've read the reviews here, and I have to say that some are a bit off.  So...here's mine...stolen a bit from one of the "bad" reviews:

When It came time for me to buy a new car, I decided that I wanted a "hot" convertible. The Mazda Miata was cute in style, but the ride is what turned me on.  I have rated the Mazda Miata MX-5 on a scale from one to ten ( ten being best).

Acceleration=9: The Miata was very peppy with the manual. Acceleration was superb on the highway and going up hills.  For a four cylinder engine, it really goes, and is relatively quiet.

Fuel Economy=9: I've driven mine for over a year, which is long enough to get gas mileage numbers. AAA reported 21 mpg in the city, and 27 mpg on the highway. Wrong!  I'm getting 25 and 32.  This is way above average for a roadster.

Handling=9: The Miata took corners with grace, and hugged the road like a Porsche (drove that before I bought this!) Overall I was very impressed in this area.  You can't get the back-end to slide around corners.

Comfort=8: The Miata had a very nice dashboard that was tasteful without feeling cheap.  My SE Miata is equipped with a Bose stereo that has great sound quality, even when driving on the freeway.  The seats are soft leather and quite comfortable.  I'm six feet tall and fit comfortably.

Ride=8: This was the part of the car that made me buy. The ride was so smooth!!! Every little bump is absorbed.  Big bumps aren't, but hey....it's a roadster.  Sweet ride!

Room=9: The Miata's interior isn't cramped, even with the top up, and visibility through the rear window is fine. With the top down, the Miata is roomier of course. The trunk is small, but quite large for a roadster. There are a few storage spots in the passenger compartment.  My stuff fits just fine.

**** The convertible top is manual and is extremely easy to put up and down.  You don't need to get out of the car, and it can be done with one hand.  What an ingenious creation.  Very user friendly.

Reliability=9: After one year...no problems.

Value=8: For $25,000 my Miata came with goodies such as leather, and a C.D. player. The Miata is a wonderful choice. Also worth noting is that Mazda's have a track-record of poor resale values.  Still...if you want a good roadster, and plan to keep it for the long haul, this is your car.  However, Miata's have an 11 year history of wonderful performance.

Key to my grading
10=Excellent
9=Great
8=Good
7=Satisfactory
6 and below= Needs Improvement
