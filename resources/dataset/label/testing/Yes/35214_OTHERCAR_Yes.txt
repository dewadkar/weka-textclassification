            I have to admit that I bought my 1999 Toyota 4-Runner Limited because I got such a good deal on it. It was used and not even a year old. I had longed for a nice SUV for some time and had my eye on a few other makes and models. The Toyota Pathfinder had been my dream SUV since the late '80s but, then Nissan came out with the XTerra. I thought that was the SUV for me but, it turned out to be much smaller than I earlier perceived. Also, no offense to other XTerra owners but, it just didn't seem......manly. 

What I love about the 4-Runner Ltd. is the ever so rugged look and feel of a full fledged SUV while still maintaining the elegance of a luxury vehicle. I get a ton of compliments on it. I opted not to get 4-wheel drive because I have no need for it in the city, which is where I work, live, and play. The leather seats, the premium stereo (CD/Cassette/AM/FM and six speakers), the sunroof, power locks and windows and dual seats, all features I appreciate in any vehicle. What makes the 4-Runner stand out for me is the quality, sturdiness, impeccable handling, speed and power of the V6, and over all style.

What I don't like about the 4-Runner is the steep price. Of course why should I be concerned with the price when I have one? Well, I still have to make the payments. :) Although I love the body mold and how the 1999 and 2000 models have it on the front and rear bumpers(very stylish, especially with the inset fog-lights), the front chips easy. Rocks, bugs...and who knows what else, all play a part in this unwanted nastiness. Fortunately, I checked into prices for replacing the front lower mold and, surprising enough, it wasn't too expensive. I was quoted about $160 without labor. Not bad...but, why should ever have to replace it?

I drove my boss' 1999 4-Runner Limited one night while taking some electronic musicians from Japan back to their hotel. I had never driven a 4-Runner before and I felt they were always out of my reach. When I got behind the wheel and took my first corner, I was in love. Not only does the 4-Runner float, it's a nice quiet ride. It handles like a car, not a truck. It accelerates well and corners like a dream.

If you are looking for your first SUV, you can get much more options at a lower price with other vehicles. For example, the Nissan Pathfinder LE is nearly $7000 less for the same &quot;style&quot; of vehicle. The Montero Sport and the Rodeo/Passport are other SUVs that have great styling with a much lower sticker price. You can always get a 4-Runner SR5 with decent options. Personally, I think the 4-Runner Limited is the leader in it's class. It's all a matter of how much money you want to spend. In this case, you get what you pay for.		<br><br>
