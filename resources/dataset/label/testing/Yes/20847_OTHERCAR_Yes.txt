            Rather than repeat all the praise, I wanted to pass along that this has been the most enjoyable car I have owned in my 31 years of driving.  It's a small car that feels quite close to a luxury car in fit, finish, smoothness and quiet.  Sure, it's no LS400, but compared to other small cars, it's impressive.  Most folks who ride with me think they're in a Camry until they get out and see how small the car is!

Yes, I'm an admitted technology-lover, but you've just got to hand it to the Toyota engineers.  This is a thoughtful, engineering tour-de-force.  Practical and comfortable, we use it for longer trips with 4 on board.  No problem.

What could be improved?  Stability in windy conditions (I'm in Chicago) could be better.  Tires are a bit skimpy and tough to find.  Gearshift is, well, unique (kind of grows on you like the SAAB ignition on the floor).  Radio controls are on a touch screen (I like buttons so I can feel the radio without looking).  But really, these are minor things.

One recommendation... use the Prius Group on Yahoo Groups to keep up with other owners.  One day, after parking outside in the cold, I started the car and got a multimedia feast.  Warning buzzers, check engine lights and ominous warning symbols.  The car ran fine, but the manual said that I should get it to the dealer fast.  I called the roadside assistance and they said the same.  When I checked the "group" a couple of members mentioned that a loose gas cap might cause such problems.  Mine was tight, but for grins I loosened it and retightened it.  Most of the nasty warnings went away and the "check engine" light left after the next startup.  No problems since.  Maybe the 30 degree temperature drop affected the pressure in the gas tank.  We'll never know.  But all was well.

Other than that the car has been flawless.  I get mid to upper 40's in warm weather.  Knock 3-4 mpg off when I need heavy air conditioning.  Knock off 5-8 miles in cold weather when the engine needs to run to keep the heater and catalytic converter happy.

Highly recommended to environmentalists, technoids like me and folks who like a smooth, fun car.  Not recommended to those who want the ultimate in cost-benefit.  Try a stripped Echo, but miss the fun.
