            The quintessential California car!!  After moving to the west coast from the midwest, we needed a smaller car for traffic, but wanted it to be fun and sporty.  After looking at different makes and models, we both fell in love with the ride and roominess of the Ford Mustang.  It is not the total sports car, as it has a softer suspension, but the ride is smoother.  Auto everything.  Very responsive in acceleration, turning and stopping. To us, this is as close to a two-seater motorcycle as we can get.  

We had some initial problems with the car, but they were taken care of by the dealer.  This had to do with the driver's seat and driver side power window.  The driver seat tends to lay back further than we are comfortable with, and the bracket that holds it upright tends to break with normal use. The power window assembly fell apart the day after we drove it off the lot.  This was replaced quickly and the seat fixed.  

As with most convertibles, you hear more road noise than in a closed car.  The windows rattle as they don't have the solid frame to rest in, but the car is solid and reliable.<br><br>
