            Very easy to use, the Sony DSC-P71 is a very good choice for people who wants a good digital camera for a low price from the competition...

I buy it 4 month ago and it takes me five seconds to take my first picture...

It's a good compromise between easiness to use and sophistication...

The Sony DSC-P71 is delivered with a 16 MB memory card but for a better enjoyment you should buy a bigger one...(with the 16Mb you can only make 10 picture in hight quality !!!)
For me, I take a 128MB and now I can take every picture I want.

Battery: you must buy a quick-charger and maybe an additional one. It costs you an extra of 70$ for the battery and 45$ for the charger but it's a good deal if you want to make everything with your new camera...

The Sony DSC-P71 has a very good picture quality even with low quality
Maximum resolution : 2048*1536

The quality is not the same for the movie...
It's a low quality but you can make a long video sequence.

The DSC-P71 got a lot of function very interesting like clip-motion or email (yea email...)

zoom 3x and 6x (digital) : good quality

The Sony Dsc- P71 is very light:226gr
so you can take it in your pocket and take picture when and where you want...
