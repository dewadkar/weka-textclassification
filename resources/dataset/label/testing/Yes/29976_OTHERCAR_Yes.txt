            This is an excruciatingly practical vehicle. We can pack in the whole family, the dog, the cat, the camping gear, and everything else we need. It works for us. But its boring. 

OK� So the sport model has a little spoiler on the back and you can get fancy wheels if you want� But this is a big-ticket family vehicle. What fiscally prudent family puts up for those extras? So, instead, you get a practical vehicle. One you can take to the beach or the hardware store and bring everything you need. But one that is just plain boring.

The seating is adequate � it's comfortable, the armrests are nice, you get a good view of the road. The controls are spartan but complete. If you want the fancy console you  pony up a few more bucks. The second row buckets allow you to keep two small kids far enough apart to keep them from pulling each others hair. The dual sliding doors allow you to get them in and out of their car seats. Baby Beluga cranks from the stereo.

I'd like a couple changes to my 2000 base SE van. I want pockets on the backs of the front seats so my kids can put their sunglasses, super-balls, and trinkets from fast food restaurants in there and reach them when the need something to occupy them. I'd also like to have a hook or two in the way-back so that when I pick up my dry-cleaning I can pop the hatch and hang it up. These are just wishes.

If you need a practical family vehicle, buy one of these. Cart your family around in it. But don't expect to be thrilled.
