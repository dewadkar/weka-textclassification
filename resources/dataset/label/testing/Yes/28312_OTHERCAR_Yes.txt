            For objects 6 inches or greater in distance, the S230 does an amazing job in its ability to take crisp, clear images. I have had very little problem with the auto-focus. Due to its size, I have found it very convenient to carry in a variety of places. Users aren't merely resigned to taking bland photos as the S230 offers many unique shooting options. Automatic manipulation of the camera settings allows for adjustment for exposure time, light balance, and locking of the automatic focus for subsequent shots. I have been able to take some unique shots at various events and locations. Daylight exposures look very good and low-light shooting exceeds expectations. Even a long-exposure at night (8-10 seconds) was relatively artifact free.

It is true that the camera has limitations - but for its size and pragmatic applications where a bulky camera would be unwelcome. If you want to shoot pictures of an anthill from 2 inches away, you will find it most difficult and blurry. If you attempt high-caliber sports photos, you will be disappointed. For me, I have no desire to do such things - and the images that I do wish to take look very good.

The issue with red-eye being a problem is quickly remedied in digital imaging software applications. I do agree - the red-eye function on the camera is worthless, and I rarely use it. However, I have yet to see an affordable "pocket camera" that can completely prevent this effect in all cases. I feel that the quality of images in spite of the red eye more than makes up for this inconvenience.

The only difficult shots that I have encountered are for items that are one to 24 inches behind a semi-transparent wall. By this &#150 exposures are rather unfocused on items inside an aquarium, behind a mesh screen, in a slight haze, etc. This is the case without a flash (with a flash I definitely don&#146t get a good image). I have found some alternatives in forcing the camera to focus behind the semi-transparent artifact with marginal success. However, shooting at landscapes and items through a glass window has been superb.

In summary, this camera is great. Its small size and features make it a great companion for traveling or daily activities where a bulky camera would become tiresome to carry. I keep the camera on my person whenever possible - which means that I only set it aside when I feel that it may be damaged. The S230 is a great value and a very nice camera for a casual photographer. It is a bit pricey - but very comparable to the competition. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is seeking a compact camera.
