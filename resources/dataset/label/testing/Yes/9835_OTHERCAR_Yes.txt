            When I started looking for a small wagon, I looked first at the Saturn S and Ford Focus, both of which have received fairly good reviews and certainly are fairly decent wagons.  I had read a little about the Daewoo Nubira wagon on the Net and decided to just go look at one.  One look and I was hooked.  It was not only much better looking, more powerful, more comfortable and roomier, better built and finished, and had every feature one could possibly want on a car like this as standard equipment, including many features that were not even offered on either of the other wagons, but it was about 19%, on average, less money than either of the other wagons.  Even the warranty is better that the other two.  You talk about a �no brainer�.

Some people might think that buying a car from a company that has only been selling in the US for a couple of years might be risky, but since Daewoo will be part of either Ford or GM by the end of the year, I think that is probably a manageable risk.  On the plus side, once the US discovers what a wonderful �bang for the buck� you get with these cars, the demand, and sadly, ultimately the price, will go up and make the Daewoo a good investment.  

I think what really sold me on the Daewoo Nubira was when I looked under the carpet in the cargo area.  In the Focus you have a piece of fiberboard simply laid on top of the spare tire to support the weight of whatever you might place in the cargo area.  In the Daewoo you find a reinforced metal door with latches and a prop rod covering the spare tire compartment.  There is also an additional padded compartment for tools, also with a reinforced metal door, and spring loaded closure mechanism.  On either side of the floor, out of the main load area, there are two additional storage compartments with doors, which are large enough to securely store camera equipment, or the like, out of view.  There are also sturdy metal rings in each corner of the cargo area to secure heavy loads.  This may seem like a small thing, but if so much attention is paid to an area that is basically hidden from view, I think this speaks well to the general overall quality and design philosophy.

Having driven the car for a while now has only reinforced my decision to buy this great little (actually not so little) car.  It rides and handles well, it is very responsive, it is comfortable to drive and quite quiet at highway speeds.  All my friends, and even some total strangers, that have looked at my car, really like it and are blown away with the low price.

I took a customer of mine, that drives a 2000 BMW 528i, to lunch several weeks after I purchased the car.  He all but called a liar when I told him what I paid for the car.  He was very impressed.
