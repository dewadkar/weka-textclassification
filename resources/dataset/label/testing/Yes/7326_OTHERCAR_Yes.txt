            This was my first Digital and I am very impressed. It has many, many useful features including Optical Zoom, Digital Zoom, Macro mode, Multiple Flash types, Time Lapse photos, etc...

It is a little bulky, but all digital cameras are, so it's not really a downside of this specific camera. I am sure some are lighter and smaller, and many are bigger and bulkier.

Having to close the lens to use the menu functions on the LCD screen is a pain, but I've gotten used to it. You learn how to be more efficient with it to minimize opens and closes.

The photo quality is great, and it takes multiple resolutions and image sizes. The smart media card system allows plenty of space for even huge, high quality photos.

I am very pleased and plan to use this all the time for years to come, from trips to parties and everything in between.
