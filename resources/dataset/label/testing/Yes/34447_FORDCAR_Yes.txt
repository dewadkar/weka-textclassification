            I had a '92 Ford Ranger and after my 6th Nebraska winter, I was tired of having no traction on the icy roads.  After doing a lot of research, I decided I wanted an F-250 SD 4x4 Crew Cab (six-pack).

I love the roominess of it, it can seat 5 adults and 1 child/teen comfortably.  My friends have all said they feel like they're in a limousine when they sit in the back.  

The <b>6.8-liter, 275-h.p. Triton V-10 engine</b> and on-the-fly 4-wheel drive make even the nastiest roads whimper.  That along with the fact that it weighs quite a bit has kept me on the road even in the iciest of conditions.

For its size, the gas mileage is quite good.  I get 8-12 in the city and 10-15 on the highway.  With today's gas prices, the 36-gallon tank can get a bit costly though.

Driving this truck is great!  It has great control and traction stability.  It's turning radius, while large compared to the Ford Ranger, it very manageable.  I would recommend that anyone new to large trucks take this one out to an <b>EMPTY</b> parking lot, use some cones and practice parking it!

This truck isn't for everyone though, the purchase and maintenance costs (Gas &amp; Insurance) can be quite prohibitive.  Make sure you budget before you buy!  If you do a lot of towing or carry a lot of heavy loads, this is the truck for you.  One thing you might not have thought of, is that this baby is an SUV for <b>under</b> $50,000... with all the perks of an SUV and then some!<br><br>
