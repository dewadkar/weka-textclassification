            I bought the 328i after I had it as a rental car for a week.  I previously owned an older 325ic, and the newer car had more pickup.  

I love the size of the car.  It is a compact with room inside, even in the back seat. 

I have had several problems with this newer 3 series than I had with my older one.  In fact, a friend of mine bought the 7 series, and he is having similar problems.  Since I purchased this new, my door locks quit working, were replaced, and are not working again, but I have driven past mileage warranty of course.  I have also had the LCD display on the on board computer quit working, it was replaced, and now I have indicator lights that randomly come on, and no one can explain it.  Occasionally, my gas guage will say I have no gas right after I get the car filled up, and it won't start working again until I fill it again.

It may be that I got a less than perfect BMW, because my previous 3 Series was 8 years old, and I only had to replace a fan in the heater -- even though it was $117.  It is also noticeable that the newer 3 Series is not as &quot;put together,&quot; as the older one was, which may be part of the problem.

The car is great to drive, however, and I will probably never own another car other than a BMW from now on.  I have had Acura's, Infiniti's, etc, in the same price range, and even with the problems, I still love the BMW. <br><br>
