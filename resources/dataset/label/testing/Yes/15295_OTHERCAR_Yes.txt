            I received this wonderful camera as a christmas present two years ago (1998).  I use it to take pictures of products which I sell on the web.  The camera works great since it just uses a 3.5&quot; floppy disk.  On Christmas eve this year on the way to a relatives we realized we were out of disks --- ran it Target grabbed a box and was in a hurry and the checker asked whats the rush?  I said oh I needed film for the camera (still can't get over calling it a disk for the camera)  -- she said did you want to go get it then?  I said oh no I have a digital and this is the film!   But remember if you do scrapbooks like I do and don't have a high quality color printer to keep a regular camera handy!<br><br>
