            I've been using this camera for about six weeks now and am very happy. 

CONVENIENCE. The camera fits easily in my shirt picture, though I wouldn't mind a thinner camera. I specifically wanted this level of convenience, so that I could take my camera with me without thinking about it.

IMAGE QUALITY. Though the camera is "only" a 2.0 megapixel camera, I have been extremely happy with image quality. The camera seems almost incapable of taking a bad photo. I use the photos mostly for PowerPoint presentations, reports, emails, or occasionally to print out, and have been impressed with the consistently high quality. The chief limitation of the 2.0 megapixel resolution is apparently in the limited ability to zoom in on and blow up portions of an image. I should note, as well, that the camera compresses images down to a typical 200 - 400 KB size, more than manageable.

VIDEO. The camera can take relatively short video segments (ranging from 10 to 15 seconds); videos are grainy, but they do include sound. I like the feature and find it useful, but don't expect this to replace your video camera.

IMAGE TRANSFER. The camera uses compact flash memory. I did my research on the web and found that Viking makes the fastest compact flash cards; I was then able to order a 128 MB Viking card on Amazon for $50 (less $5 discount by supplying a "promotional code). This one card can hold several hundred images. I also order a Viking Compact Flash adapter PC Card for under ten bucks that lets me plug the flash card directly into my computer--hugely convenient (more convenient than an adapter base, as I use a laptop).

My overall take on this camera--by next year, we'll probably be able to buy a thinner camera with a longer battery life and higher resolution. But in the meantime, I'm extremely happy with this little camera, and recommend it highly.
