            I am the proud owner of two Mazda 626's (1991 and 1998).  My 1991 Model has 255,000 miles and other than regular oil changes has only had to have one battery, two fuel pumps, two alternators, a two CV joints.  <b> UPDATE:  Since my first writing I did blow a head gasket and lost a water pump on the 1991 model.  I had it fixed for $750 and it is running fine again.  </b> It now uses a quart of oil about every 3,000 miles.  That only began after 200,000 miles.  It has simply been the best car I've ever owned <b> (MY OPINION HASN'T CHANGED).</b>

The 1998 Model has only had regular maintenance and is basically the same style as the 2000 Model.  <b> UPDATE:  My 1998 Model has 65,000 miles and is still running strong with no problems thus far. </b>For its size, it has incredible back seat room.  To look at the car from the outside, you wouldn't expect to get the amount of leg room you get in the back.  The 98 Model is slightly more cramped than the 91 Model for the driver because of the airbag and the console in the middle.  It might be a problem for a tall driver.  The gas mileage is about 28 in town and 33 on the road.  This car features Power Windows and Locks, Automatic, A/C, Cruise Control, Tilt Steering, Airbags, Anti-Lock Brakes, etc.  Our car has leather seats and is available as an extra feature.  The engine is a full-injected four cylinder engine that has more than enough power.  It pulls hills very well, even in mountainous terrain.  The trunk space is also much larger than expected.  The back seats can be lowered so that longer items can be stored...that is if you don't have back seat passengers.  Of course, the car isn't meant to be a truck.  My Mazda 626 rides very well.  I am very pleased with it's look and all-around performance.  I highly recommend it.
