            We traded in our '95 Dodge Neon for our '98 Chevy S-10 last year at Christmas.  The Neon felt like a tin can on roller skates and we were looking for something more sturdy.  We found that in our S-10!  It rides tough and handles the road great.  The truck gets at least 23 mpg going to and from work.  And gets even better going on long trips.  The interior of the truck is like a Cadillac to us.  The stereo/Cd player setup is excellent.  The volume adjusts according to the interior noise level.  The headlights come on and off whenever you start the engine. Or they can be operated manually.  If you happen to leave your turn signal on too long (we have all been behind one of those) a gentle beep sound will remind you to turn off the turn signal.  The seats adjust comfortably for those longs trips.  There are dual air bags that can be turned off for the passenger seat if a car seat or small child is up front with you. The 2 side seats in the back of the extended cab are comfortable enough for two people to sit in.  They also have seatbelts back there.  Not quite as comfortable in the back for two adults or long-legged people.  But, our children don't mind riding back there.  If anyone asks me how I like my truck, I just tell them,  &quot;She is better than any Cadillac and she's a 5-speed to boot!&quot;  Anyone who likes a tough small truck with the luxuries of a car should buy the Chevy S-10 Extended Cab pick-up.<br><br>
