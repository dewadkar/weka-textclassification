            This is a short review, because I have to get back to work.

I've had a 4.0 SE since 1995, which makes it one of the very first imported into the US. It's been all across the country, through deserts, mountains, trails, and highways. It's incredibly safe, and a real utility vehicle. It hauls more than my pickup, rides like a Jaguar, and gets looks and approval from parking valets.

It's never, ever, been anything but capable.

However,

This is not the car to buy if you're thinking about a Cherokee. You need to love it and it will love you back. It is very well built, but also eccentric. The switches are not where you'd expect them. The engine (mine's a 4.0, since the bigger engine didn't exist when I bought it) isn't as strong as you'd hope. There are three viscous couplers in the drive train. The emergency brake is connected to the transmission. There's a strange set of glass fiber torsion bars on the rear wheels. The air suspension reminds me of a old Citroen. The windshield has funny little wires in it. The automatic transmission shifter has an H pattern (for low range).

But it's all great! It adds up to the best offroad vehicle there is, bar none. Drive it and you'll be hooked. The upright position and great glass area help you be a better driver. If you do get in trouble, the ABS brakes all around are excellent. And the stereo is fabulous. Mines got 11 speakers, and the newer ones have even more.

Yes, the maintenance costs are high. I think its because there's a lot to maintain. The dealer service and manufacturer support are excellent, especially if you live near one.

It's a great car. Now if I could just get my wife to give it back so I could drive it.
