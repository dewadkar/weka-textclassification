            My family has had our 1991 Camry since we bought it new back in late 1990.  It still has the original burgundy paint with the grey interior.

Ours is a 4 door, five speed manual transmission, 4 cylinder, with power windows and locks, and a towing package.

This car has been across the country and back several times.  We always take it on trips.  So far, the only major repairs needed have been an alternator, a new clutch, a timing belt, tires, and brakes.  We have already driven over 260,000 miles on this car and plan to put 300k on it before getting another.

We had a problem with the trunk latch a couple of years ago.  The trunk wouldn't close - you had to slam it a couple of times to get the latch to catch.  We had that fixed at little cost.  Other than that and the few items previously mentioned, this car has run for over 260k miles with only gas refills and oil changes.

Although it is only a 4 cylinder, we pull a 1800 pound pop-up camper all over with it.  Never has there been a problem.  This car pulls that camper without hesitation and comfortably - even at 70+ mph on the interstate.

The interior has held up great as well.  We still have the factory installed AM/FM/Cassette stereo - still works great.  All of the automatic windows and locks are still doing just fine.  We have had to replace the original floors mats (and will have to soon replace them again) because we have worn holes in them.

This car goes camping with us and is used to go to and from work every day.  Still never a problem.  Our goal is to put 300k miles on it and then trade it in on a new one.

The exterior is holding up wonderfully.  We also have a 1993 Honda Accord and the paint on the hood and trunk is already oxidizing.  There is not one spot of oxidation on the Camry.  There are a few scratches but that comes with prolonged use (especially hauling the camper out to remote campgrounds).

The A/C system and heating system have withstood the test of time.  We have had to put freon in the A/C but otherwise the system still cools great.

I must admit that the newer Camry's seem much larger and roomier and we can't wait to trade ours in for a new one, but it is hard to part with a car that has been so dependable (and still is).  The seats are a little narrow and therefore become a little cramped on long trips, but overall the ride is smooth, fairly quiet, and comfortable.  And we just cannot top the durability and dependability.  We have never had such a reliable car.

The only thing that has always bugged me about this car is the manual reclining seats.  There is not a lever to pull to recline the seats.  There is a dial/wheel on the side of the seat that you must keep turning, seeming dozens of times, to get the seat to adjust backwards or forwards.  This is really annoying, but it is a small price to pay for dependability.

Overall, I would recommend this car to anyone.  I am sold on the Camry because it has spent the last 10+ years proving itself.
