            ***UPDATE***
Well now fast food places have designed a cup that eliminates the leaning tower of pizzia drink problem.  I also hit a dear with my car I managed to swerve &amp; only hit it with the front passenger side of my car.  There was just a little dent &amp; I thought---gee that's not too bad I can live with it but as it turned out I had more damage under the hood well I got it taken care of &amp; you know it was a blessing in disguise because my hood had a tiny spot of rust on the hood so now I have a NEW HOOD all thanks to that deer!! He gave his life to give me a new hood!  

I'm really pleased with my car I eat lunch in it every day it's reliable &amp; pretty.  I heard the other day that people who wash their cars are less likely to wreck them it's something to think about.  I have been washing this care MORE than I ever washed my old car in the years I had it I'm even waxing it!!!  It still looks like a bomb went off on the inside most of the time though.

OK I'll admit it I didn't shop around.  I borrowed a car to drive to the dealer in &amp; bought the first one on the lot-uh that's the first one that wasn't white I know myself too well.  One thing I do not like are the seats!! I'm 5 ft even &amp; I feel like I'm laying down driving when I sit all the way with my back up against the seat and it feels like I'm siting up against a brick-well maybe not a brick but a cushion that's a bit too firm. I hope I'll adjust in time.  Now you ask why the heck did you buy it.  I bought it because my car died in the middle of an intersection &amp; I needed something bad!!  

Another con aside from the comfort or discomfort of the seats is the drink holder. Unless you like to live dangerously &amp; cram your .32 oz. drinks up against the console so that it looks like the leaning tower of Piazza buy a cup holder.  Oh yeah I transferred my old cup holder from my wreck-excuse me my other car to my new one that's no way it fits.  I can't believe that the people who built this car actually didn't think to accommodate it for those large drinks that everyone buys.  I refuse to take my mother's advice &amp; buy a smaller drink.  So I guess I'll just live dangerously!!

Now for the good news it's beautiful &amp; you'll get a lot of turned heads when you drive.  Oh and I can't say enough about the moon roof.  I've never had a moon roof before.  It's a quiet ride all in all I'm pleased. I'm happy to have a NEW car that's not going to leave me stranded-hopefully!  Oh yeah and the men car salesmen were hunks.  I'm only 5 ft tall &amp; they all looked like they were 8ft to me!! ha ha ha ha.

Sticker price 12,906.95
Amount financed 18,934.80--guess I paid too much? My interest rate is like %16. so I definately need to see about having my financing transferred someplace else!!
