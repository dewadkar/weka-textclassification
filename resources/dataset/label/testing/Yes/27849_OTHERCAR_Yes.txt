            I got this car as a business rental from Budget Rentals so I don't know what the price range is.
 
I found it had lots of pickup. Larger interior than the '91 Ford Escort I'm used to. I would have preferred a stick, but most rentals are automatics. Trunk was large enough by at least a third for my two suitcases and duffle bag. The backseat looks large enough to hold my 2 kids and their car seats with ease. Controls were easy to find, reach, and understand. During the time I had the car, I drove about 150 miles and used a half a tank of gas. Nice cup holders in the center console with a flip top to provide holders for the back. I didn't really like the controls on the radio, but once I found a station I liked, it didn't move anyway. There was a cd player in the model I had, but I didn't have any cd's. The seatbelts were set a little narrow and it took me a few rides before I could snap them without looking for them. I think my wife would really like this car.
