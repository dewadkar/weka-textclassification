            I had bought 96 Sebring, V6, hard top about 8 months ago, and couple of weeks ago i got into an accident. I can't believe i wrecked my car. It was the best car i ever had. When i bought it, i got real good deal. i paid around $11,000. Everything was power. I never had to any maintenance except change the oil. Oh, i did had to change the battery one time. About 2 months ago, i was at work. I was gonna go to lunch and all the sudden my car won't start, some people told me it maybe the starter, but when i got it checked, it was the battery. I think the battery that died was factory battery. After that, i never had a problem. 
i still can't believe i wrecked it, however it was tight ride. Now i am looking for Jeep Wrangler, year 95 or newer..
If you want luxuary car, buy Chrysler Sebring.<br><br>
