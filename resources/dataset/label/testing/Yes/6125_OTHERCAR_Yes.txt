            My husband just received a 2000 Chevy Impala as his company car.  Since we don't buy them, we don't have much say as to what kind of car we want.  The past several years, my husband has been given new Chevy Luminas.  We couldn't complain, but the cars weren't that impressive (except that they were free).  

We are pleasantly surprised with our new Impala.  It has so many features for the money - much more than our Lumina did.  The sticker on this car was under $21,000 so it isn't the base model, but also isn't their top of the line.  Ours came with keyless entry, speed control, cassette ( rats - really wanted that CD player), and many more features.

One thing we really like about the Impala is the spaciousness - even though it isn't a huge car.  My husband is 6'5 - with VERY long legs &amp; does not even have to put his seat all the way back!  This has never occurred in any other car we've ever had.  We also like the roominess of the trunk.  It has been designed so that no arms go into the trunk to reduce the space.  In our Lumina we always had to strategically place items so that there was clearance for the trunk arms.  Now what we see is what we get!  It's great - especially since we have 2 young kids. 

The front and rear seats are very comfortable.  There is also the middle shoulder belt in the back which I prefer to have in a car.  There are also 3 headrests for the rear passengers. 

The ride is wonderful.  The steering is tight (the way I like it).  I feel like I have a lot of control on the road.  It was especially nice in the recent snow storm we had.  This front-wheel drive vehicle cruised without a slip through the snow.  

The design of the car is sleek looking, except that I don't really care for the back end and tail lights.  

This is a car that we would consider buying for ourselves if we didn't have the company car.  We couldn't say that about the Lumina.  <br><br>
