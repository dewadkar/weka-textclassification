              I can't say enough how much I love this truck! I shopped around for months looking for the right truck for me and my family, that's right my family. There aren't too many trucks that you can buy that effectively let you put your family in the equation. After much comparison shopping, and eliminating the Dodge Ram (no where near enough rear passenger room), the Chevy Silverado (the full size 4 door configuration was way too expensive) and the foreign made trucks, all of which were way too small, there was only the Supercrew left. 

   I selected the 2002 Ford Supercrew 4x4 XLT with the 5.4 litre engine. Other than the engine upgrade, the only extras I got were the running boards, for my wife, the bedliner and the soft tonneau cover. I highly recommend the Ford bedliner, a colleague of mine has the same truck and tried to save a couple bucks by going aftermarket, but he constantly complains that the liner shifts and has to be adjusted once a month. However, I say you can save some money by going and getting a soft cover on your own, if you want one. 

   Now, back to the truck. This truck rides like a dream. I can't say enough of how impressed I am with it. The ride is solid, with road noise that is less than most other cars I've ever been in. The interior of the truck is enormous. There is definately enough room for 5 full size adults to comfortably go for a ride. There's room for 6, but I don't think that the 6th person would be too comfortable in the middle of the front seat. I have one young child who uses a car seat. The truck has the LATCH car seat anchors on the outboard rear seats and they are great. I'm a police officer and I know how important it really is for child seats to be PROPERLY anchored, these mounts are perfect for a tight fit. On that note, even with a child seat in the back there is lots of room for 2 adults. There also are headrests in the rear seat, Dodge and Chevy don't have them.
They don't seem that important, until someone is rear ending you and your rear passengers heads are hitting glass instead of soft fabric. 

   The fit, finish, ride and handling of this truck are excellent. The bed is short though, at 5'6" contractors should stay away from this one and upgrade to a F-250. But I'm an active DIY'er and it is more that sufficient for getting sheets of drywall or plywood from Home Depot and bringing them home. No surprise that the truck is BIG, parking and negotiating through parking lots took a little while to get used to, but I've had the truck for three months now and I quite comfortable. 

   I'm glad I bought this truck, because it will allow me to keep it as my family grows. With plenty of room for three child seats, I won't be scrambling two years from now looking for a minivan. I can't comment on reliability because the truck is only three months old. But the seats are very comfortable and my wife and I have been using it as our primary vehicle because it is so comfortable. The sticker price on the truck was $32,605- , but with discounts and a $2000- Ford rebate the net price was $26,800 before taxes. I was very happy with the price and I'm even happier with the truck. My wife loves the power adjustable gas and brake pedals that come with the XLT package, they make it much easier for shorter people to comfortably drive the truck

   The only negative comment I can make about the truck is the gas mileage. Its poor, to say the least, however, I did expect it so I really can't complain.
