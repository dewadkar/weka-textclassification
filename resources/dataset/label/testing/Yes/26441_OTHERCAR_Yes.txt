I purchased my 2002 Honda Accord Coupe Special Edition in June of 2002.  I was wanting a 2003 Accord, but when the bodystyle came out I decided to get a 2002 model.  I had recently purchased a 2000 Accord Coupe and was extremely please with the handling and powerfulness of the 4 cylinder engine, however I did want a car w/ more power so I purchased a 2000 Honda Prelude...but as faith would have it I missed the Accord.  

So now I am driving the 2002 Accord and I love it.  I love the styling, handling, gas mileage, the many features and options that are available for the Accord.  The customer service aspect isn't any different.  The staff at Honda Service is the best I have every encountered.  They are friendly, courteous and efficient.  

I would recommend any Honda Product to anyone looking for an affordable car that has a long standing history of quality and durability.  There is nothing I can say negative about Honda Accords except they should cost more b/c they are worth it
