            I bought this car used in December of 98 with 28,000 miles on it, loaded with options.  It's up to 77,000 miles now and I have not had one problem with it.  Everything works as well now as the first day I bought it.  Very comfortable on long trips, moves like a bat outta ---- when I need it to.  Never any problems passing on the highway with this car!  Easy to read gages, everything is within my reach and there are no blind spots to compensate for when trying to park in those tight spaces.  Multi-position seats can suit even my 6' 5" son! It's larger than a small car, still not a boat.  Excellent handling, gas mileage and highly dependable.  This is perhaps the best sedan I have ever driven or owned.  My experience with Toyota has always been positive.
