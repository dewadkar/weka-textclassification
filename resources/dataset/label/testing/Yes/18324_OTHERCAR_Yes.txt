            Let's start off by saying that these cars are one of the best bangs for the buck. The Turbocharged 2 liter engine is one of the best engines to come out of Japan. The car responds beautifully to modifications, I put only $700 in to the car and ran 13.6's in the 1/4 mile, that is Vette territory. It handles like a dream also. I have the AWD model the GSX but the GS-T has the same motor but is limited to only FWD. The AWD is far superior in bad weather and has a lot more control in the snow. It does however have a tiny back seat and I would say that only children would be comfortable back there on long trips. I am 6' tall and there are no problems with seating position as long as no one sits behind you, ;-) .It also gets good gas mileage when not beaten on ranging from 22-28 mpg for the AWD and probably 3 more for the FWD. I have a 5spd and I absolutely love it! I recommend them to everyone, but just don't get a 2000 eclipse thinking it is the same car, IT&quot;S NOT!! If you do buy one invest in a turbo timer for $100 to let the turbo cool so it has a happy life. Good Luck!<br><br>
