            ... yeah, and then there came the others. You know, the Boxter, Z3, and now the S2000
                    and the MR-Spyder. Each of these cars are fine cars in their own class. But the Miata
                    stands as the one who brought back the affordable roadster. It's not the fastest; it's not
                    the most expensive &lt;g&gt;; it's not a lot of things. But one thing is for sure IMHO, it's the
                    best. You'll find yourself taking the long route home from work. Trips to the store
                    become more frequent and longer. You'll get up off the couch to go peak into the
                    garage to take a look at it. Other Miata drivers will wave because they &quot;know&quot; why you
                    have that grin permanently fixed on your face. The Miata handles well, is reliable, and I
                    think it's destined to become a 'classic.' Even if you're considering the competition
                    (closest in cost will be the Toyota MR-Spyder), you owe it to yourself to try the Miata.
                    Besides, if it were not for the Miata, there would be no Boxter, Z3, S2000... yaddi yaddi
                    yaddi. And don't forget the Miata Club of America, www.miata.net, and the tons of
                    aftermarket goodies available to customize your new found love. <br><br>
