            I looked at several vehicles before making the decision to get out of my Nissan lease early (thank the powers above).

I looked at the Saturn LS, Dodge Stratus, and all of the Hondas.  I decided on the Cougar for several reasons.

Back in November of 1999, my fiancee was looking at a new car.  In Maxim, they had a picture of all of the 2000s, and the Cougar stood out on the page.  She thought it was not practical enough for her, so she got a Civic (nice car).

This past month, I went car shopping and the Cougar was the last car I looked at.  The Stratus was close, but I decided to take the Cougar considering it was less money and my fiancee had a 4-door car.  Being only in the second week, I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

First off, the Mercury dealer was the most honest.  The Dodge dealers were kind of shady, and the Saturn did not allow me to haggle the price (although they did offer me some sort of money off).  Also, the Mercury drove well and I just loved the little computer with all that information.

I got a fantastic deal on my car.  It was fully loaded except for leather, sunroof, and CD changer.  I paid just over $17,000 with all of these dealer incentives. I got the &quot;laser red&quot; color.

The car is a headturner.  People stair at my car.  It looks a lot more expensive than the price.  With the wide tires and cool rims, people are always gazing at the car.  The front with the sleek hood design and the rear with the spoiler and shaped tail are freaking cool.  Plus, the side designs are narly as well.

OK, so as you can tell, I love this car.  The only real negative with this car is the small back seat.  While the bucket seats in the back look nice, there are not too many people that can sit back there.  Also, the radio could be a little more user friendly.

I would tell everyone that is looking for a reasonably-priced sports car to jump on this cat.  It is well worth the price<br><br>
