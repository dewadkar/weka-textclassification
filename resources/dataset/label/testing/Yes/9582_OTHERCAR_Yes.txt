            I was probably one of the first ones to get my 2000 Celica GTS. When I first saw the car on a commercial, I knew I wanted it. I have had the car for a few weeks now and I am still excited every time I get to drive it.
For a sports car, it is very spacious inside and the suspension is stiff, but still comfortable.
It handles great on the freeway and in tight corners and the acceleration is amazing. Everything works fine, there is really just one thing I have a problem with- there is a squeaky noise coming from the trunk. I don't know what it is, but on bumpy streets, it can be annoying. This might be limited to my car only, though.
I get 29 miles to the gallon driving half the time in the city, half on the freeway. The actual mileage might be even better if I wasn't stepping on the gas so hard all the time.
Buy the new Celica if you like the looks, everything else is just great unless you want a family car. Also, make sure to get a quote from your insurance first, I was a bit shocked when I found out how much it was. It's worth it to me, though.<br><br>
