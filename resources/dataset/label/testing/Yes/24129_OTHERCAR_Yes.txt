            The 3000GT is a wonderful car. It has great looks, of course, but there are many other points that set this car apart from the pack. 
First, these cars can really move. It's true that they are a bit heavier than most other sports cars, but keep in mind it also has many toys that require more machinery. Things like electronic controlled suspension, electronically controlled exhaust, all wheel drive and all wheel steering (in turbo models). All these things are put into easy reach of the driver, to be called upon on demand. 
Personally I have a Dodge Stealth (basically the same car except styling), but I can tell you that the 3000GT is a car for the ages. Yes, I have driven one, and yes, I would suggest any would be buyer of a sports car also drive one and see the difference. 
The interior is nicely done, quality leather seats that are comfortable for even very long drives. Low to the ground, making you feel like a pilot in a fighter jet (although I don't recommend the 'fighter' mentality on the highways:-). True, the back seats are not made for any adult, although you can fit smaller grown-ups back there. The fact is that those seats are merely there for insurance reasons, and to let those with kids justify the purchase. 
There are troubles that occur with the car, but any car anyone ever owns is going to have some kind of trouble, especially if driven in the manner that the 3000GT is born to be driven. 
For the money, I can't think of another car that has all that the 3000GT (Stealth) does. Not a one.<br><br>
