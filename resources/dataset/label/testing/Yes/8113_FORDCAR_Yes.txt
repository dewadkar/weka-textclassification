            I bought this car used about 6 months ago.  Although it rides a little bumpy like a truck usually does, I like it more and more every day.  Surprisingly, it has plenty of power for pulling away quickly when traffic is tight.  It handles very well for city driving, which is just about all I do.  It has a tight enough turning radius and is easy to park.  My explorer sport, which is white, is fully loaded.  It has a nice beige leather interior, 6 cd in dash, upgraded wheels, power sun roof, power driver's seat, cruise control, four wheel drive, tinted windows, etc.  The best part is that it looks so nice on the outside.  The sport model is about 10 inches shorter than the 4 door, which I think looks just great.  To me, it is vastly better looking than the 4 door, but I am a 2 door fan all the way and always have been.  It's a matter of personal taste I guess.  Don't kid yourself though, it's not good if you have back seat passengers often.  There is a roomy back seat, but it is tough to get back there.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have to drive around a bunch of kids or are in a car pool situation.  Forget it if you have a child seat to deal with.  Then you'll have to get the 4 door.  Even if you need the 4 door, this is still a nice riding, comfy, and powerful suv.  In my 2 door sport there is plenty of cargo room to carry around a lot of goodies (like a couple of sets of golf clubs) in the back.  
If you buy a used one, you can get it so much cheaper than a new one.  I paid $16,900 for mine with 32K miles on it, and a new '03 model with the same equipment approaches $28,000.  I have a short commute to work and do not put a lot of miles on my cars, so it was a no-brainer decision to buy the used one because I found a really nice one at a good used car dealer that I trust.  A new one would depreciate so rapidly anyhow.
Overall, this is a good looking, reliable, powerful suv that is not too monstrously big, but plenty big enough for me.  Get one!
