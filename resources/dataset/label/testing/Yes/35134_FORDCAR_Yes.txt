            I test drove Ford Escort ZX2 and loved it from the beginning. It was powerful and quiet comparing to Civic and Corolla. It also was comfortable to drive in (I could hardly fit in the Civic). I like its 130 HP engine and especially its automatic transmission. Civic was jerking like crazy when shifting. My Escort is so called "ZX2 Hot" (power everything, remote key, defroster, alloy wheels). However, I don't have a moonroof because it takes a couple of inches from the top of the car. ABS is not standard and cost about $500. I didn't choose one, because it was just a little too much money.

Driving this car is easy. Acceleration is good at any speed. Transmission seems to feel that it's time to downshift when passing. Engine is quite loud at high RPM, but it's _much_ quieter than in Civic. When driving at 65 MPH I can hardly hear anything. Handling is very precise. This car is stable in sharp turns at high speed.

After about 3 months I started hearing rattling noise from the dashboard. It appeared that plastic dashboard had a small horizontal plastic panel over the steering wheel and it was rattling a little. I had to put a couple of pieces of tape to stop the rattling. Now everything is _completely_ quiet :)

This car is a typical compact car. But it has just a little more engine and a little less noise. However it depreciates quite fast (stupid public prejudice). So you should buy it slightly used - you can't beat the price :))
