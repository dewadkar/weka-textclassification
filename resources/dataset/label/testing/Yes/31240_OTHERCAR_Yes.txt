            I own a '95 grand am gt, it is very fun and pretty quick.  It handles corners very well.  You can easily take corners going 30 without squealing the tires and if you want some real fun you can do it going 60 but will burn some rubber.  But the car won't fish tail out and if you are a very good driver you could handle it with ease.  It is somewhat comfy but for longer rides the sportier seats can get a little uncomfortable.  With the gt package you get a lot, i have ground effects, spoiler, 4 speed tranny, and power everything.  The gas gauge does kinda suck but on the gt model you get a low gas light.  The gt model is very nice for the younger crowd and i haven't had any problems.  The car runs smooth but has a few squeeks in the dash.<br><br>
