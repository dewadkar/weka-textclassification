            My Wife and I were looking for a car that would be good for the family.  We owned (at the time) a Jeep Cherokee.  We liked the Cherokee, but the minute we drove the Explorer, we knew we would no longer own one.  The ride was so smooth, more like driving a car than a large truck.  It handled well, did not pull, and reacted well in extreme situations.  

We tried all of the Sport Utility Vehicles before we purchased our Explorer Limited.  Nothing even came close to the roominess (except the huge SUV's of course), and the ride.

I highly recommend this vehicle.<br><br>
