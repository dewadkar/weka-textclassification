            Everyone (or nearly everyone) has heard the little joke about Ford--Fix Or Replace Daily.  A neat little acronym made up of the the letters in the name which describes Ford owners' viewpoint.   Though they have been the butt of many jokes, and though I knew the reputation of the cars, I was totally jazzed when we bought our Escort LX.  From the day the car was brought home, my mind was forever changed about the performance of a Ford.  I know it may sound a little weird to say this, but Gertie (that's what we named the car) has been the best car  person could ever have.  It has never given us any major trouble, other than the fact that it seems the car designers tore up the specs for it and all Ford Escorts, because it is the dickens trying to find replacement parts for simple components.  

Still, after hearing all the horror stories, especially since the car was bought used, my family and I have been pleasantly surprised and grateful the excellent service we have gotten.  I can't say that I am particularly enamored of 4 cylinder vehicles, as I am a person who loves performance cars--Mustang, Camaro, etc.  But, for a 4 cylinder, this car sometimes drives as if it were much more.  It starts and runs like a dream, and is great on gas milage.  For those who want power and performance, this may not be the car for you, but if you want a dependable, reliable, efficient vehicle, then this may be the car for you.  This is an especially good car for first time drivers, the elderly, and those who just want a car to do local driving.  To be truthful, the car was bought to take car of all the needs of my family--school, work, grocery store, etc.  You name it, we drove there!  Luckily for us, the car has stood the test of time and milage. 

I simply love the car, and it has been a wonderful and safe driving experience.<br><br>
