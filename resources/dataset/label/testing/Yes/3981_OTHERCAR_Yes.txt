            When my parents were getting ready to trade in their '98 Saturn SL2, I thought that they would shop around to find their next vehicle. They went to the Saturn dealership once and they were sold on the LS. Saturn has an amazing customer service record, so it is no wonder that people like dealing with them- between cups of coffee and customer appreciation days, it's hard not to like them. I was a bit skeptical of the car at first but after driving the vehicle I have to say it was a good purchase. The car drives very smoothly; it accelerates well, it turns well, and it just has a very nice ride to it. The seats are much more comfortable than those in the SL series, and the added leg room is definately a plus. The trunk on this car is amazing, it seems we've said goodbye to the days of filling the trunk and storing extra items in the backseat. The stereo system that came with the car is great, it has a very full sound and is extremely clear. My only complaint about this car is the plastic interior parts- they feel sort of light and cheap. Overall I think this car is good deal and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an economical larger size vehicle. <br><br>
