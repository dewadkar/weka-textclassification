            I purchased my MVC-FD71 about a year and a half ago, and have taken over 1,000 snapshots with it.  One of the nicest features of the Mavica line is the fact that shots are put onto standard 1.44MB floppy disks.  It's not very difficult to carry a number of these around with you, and since you can delete pictures and reuse the disks, you can end up with unlimited shots.  If you have trouble taking good photos, having unlimited tries to get one shot right helps.  The LCD screen lets you preview your work, so you don't have to be tied to your PC to see if you got the shot... and you never have to go through waiting for film to be developed to find out your shots were no good ever again.

There are a few things that can be improved with this particular camera model, however.  It has a 10X zoom, but it would be nice to be able to use interchangeable lenses to get more range when you need it.  The lithium battery that comes with it lasts quite a while, but you can't take any shots while it is recharging unless you sink 50 to 100 bucks on a spare.  The resolution on the camera can be set to a few different levels, but the highest res picture available is a 640 x 480 bitmap, which takes up an entire floppy.  Many other cameras boast 800 x 600 pictures as a minimal setting, with even higher resolutions available, and have memory cards that allow many more pictures to be taken.

Overall, the Mavica does the job for me.  I can take shots of anything I want, and if I take my time, I can take shots that rival what I'd take with a normal camera.  Combine the Mavica with a good quality printer, and you may never need to take film photographs again.  Any and all photos you see on my website (once I put the site back up!) were taken with my Mavica, including the pic of me on my profile here on Epinions.

If you have a high end computer with USB ports or a port made for the memory cards from other cameras, or if you need to take super high quality photographs, you may want to look elsewhere.  As for me, I'm happy with my purchase.<br><br>
