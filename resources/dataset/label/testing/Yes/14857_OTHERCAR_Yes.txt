            I have never had a better vehicle than my 1994 TransAm with 5.7L and 6-speed manual. The overall quality of the vehicle is nearly perfect. At 89,000 miles, the vehicle has NEVER seen a repair facility. Only the headlamp motors had to be replaced. (1 at 45,000 miles; the other at 85,000 miles.)The &quot;giddy up and go&quot; aspect is the best; mid-range torque is incredible. Overall ride and handling is great (compared with my former '90 Camaro and '85 Mustang GT). Gas mileage is great, considering its V8 powerplant. I get better-than-expected highway mileage. I love the interior -- extremely ergonomic and well designed. Sure the back seat is small; but if you need a roomy rear seating area, buy a sedan. The TransAm is perfect for folks who want to have FUN driving from point A to point B. It's for folks who want a Corvette, Porsche, etc., but don't have the funds. I LOVE my TransAm and plan to keep it for quite awhile. If I ever need to replace it; I'll buy another.<br><br>
