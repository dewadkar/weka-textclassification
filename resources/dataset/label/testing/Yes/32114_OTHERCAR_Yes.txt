            The Chrysler 300M is one outstanding automobile. Someone who appreciates a great performing, great handling car, but needs family space and also wants some luxury will find this car to be the perfect choice. With its highly responsive 3.5 liter engine, tight suspension, and all around very responsive handling, this car is a blast to drive. Yet it's very roomy and has all the luxury bells and whistles of much more expensive cars. Leather interior, automatic climate control, ABS, traction control, remote keyless entry, etc. are all standard. About the only available options are moonroof, upgraded stereo with in dash four disc CD changer, and an even tighter suspension, which may actually be a case of too much of a good thing. The standard suspension is that good. I did a lot of research before I bought this car. I considered cars like the Infiniti I30 and the BMW 3 Series, but the 300 won out. At a price just under $30,000, this is an exceptional value for the family man who really wants to drive a sports car, but wants to be pampered a little bit too.<br><br>
