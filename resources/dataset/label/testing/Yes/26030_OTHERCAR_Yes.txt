                I will tell you right off--I LOVE THIS CAR!!
About two years ago my lease was expiring on my old car. I have two daughters that I trolly around as well as work full time. My husband worked 12 hours a day so I really needed a roomy and reliable car.
I definitely found it in this 99'Dodge Stratus!

     EXTERIOR: I think it is a Great looking car-that is what attracted me to this one. It is long and sleek looking and swoops down in the front. It was available in many different colors (I got Platinum)some were a little too wild for me-like a shimmering green! But it was available in all the regular colors you are used to seeing on the road.

     INTERIOR: Car comes in your normal variety of interiors, leather or fabric seats. I chose the fabric. It is a dark, velvet like with a pattern to it. Very comfortable, I could easily sleep in this car if I ever had to! My girls love the back seat-it has plenty of room so they always take plenty of things to do with them-makes for a more pleasant ride.

     RIDE: The ride is smooth, quiet and VERY enjoyable. Handles very well on the road or the freeway.

     RELIABILITY: Very reliable-have not had one problem yet. Have not taken it into the dealer for anything except normal maintenance(oil and filter change and fluid refills).

     EXTRA'S:
              Power Tilt Steering-Makes it real easy to get in and out.  With Power steering the car is very easy to maneuver and you can get in and out of tight spaces with ease.

              Power Door locks- Work great-sometimes I even forget to release so the kids can get out of the car for school-oops!

              Valet Key-Great-when you valet your car, give them this key and they can not get into your trunk!

              AM/FM Stereo/ Cassette-GREAT sound! This car has many speakers in it-even in the doors! I always have to remember to turn the stereo down before I get out of my car to get the mail or my neighbors will think I am a loud wild woman! Oops-I'm getting off the subject-This stereo also has  the normal tone and control knobs with the fader and balance as well. It also has a seek button to find all your favorite songs. Cassette player works real well too-with the standard fast forward/ rewind buttons.              

              Dual Airbags-Driver and right front passenger airbags. The drivers airbag is mounted in the steering wheel and the passengers is mounted tin the instrument panel, above the glove compartment. These air bags inflate in higher speed impacts-hopefully I will never know how they really work.

 Overall-I think this is a really great car, very reliable, comfortable, roomy, nice looking.  I will be really sad when my lease is up in another year-but who knows-maybe the new Dodge Stratus will be even better!!

If you get a chance to test drive one-Go ahead!!
