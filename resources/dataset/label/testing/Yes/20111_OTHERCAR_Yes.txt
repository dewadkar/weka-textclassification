            The M5 is the flagship of BMW's M cars, and is touted by BMW as THE Ultimate Driving Machine. Based on the 5-Series platform, the M5 is the most powerful M car ever built and the first to offer a V8 engine. All purchasers are even entitled to a 2-day M5 Driver Training Program at the BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg, SC!

Below is a little story of the first M5 delivered to the US.. After reading it, you should know what kind of potential this car has! Enjoy!

First BMW M5 in U.S. Delivered
   On Friday, October 22nd, the first 2000 BMW M5 was delivered here in the United States. The lucky individual, John Fischer invited me to join him in picking up his dream car at Braman Motorcars in West Palm Beach, Florida. He figured since I talked him into putting down a hefty deposit 2 years ago, I should have the privilege of accompanying him to the dealership. Palm Beach boy racers were already at the dealership eyeing this latest creation from BMW.
   We were immediately greeted by the salesman, Bob Sloan and Braman General Sales Manager, Steve Grossman. The dealership was a buzz of activity as this was the first M5 off the boat from Germany. Folks who have deposits on the car came from Singer Island, Palm Beach and other neighboring towns just to take a closer look at this fine piece of machinery. After what seemed to be an eternity the car was pulled around front and &quot;our&quot; M5 lesson was about to begin. Mr. Sloan spent a good half hour educating us on the cars navigation system. Every five minutes either Jon or myself would say &quot;OK BOB, lets take it for a drive&quot;. His response was &quot;we will be finished with this portion of the delivery experience in a couple of minutes&quot;. To his credit he was giving us ther BMW delivery to the letter.  Both of us could care less how the navigation system or stereo system worked for that matter. We will figure it out later. We wanted to drive this wolf in sheep's clothing!
   The paperwork done, I sat in the passenger seat as this lucky M5 owner pulled out. I first noticed how unique the headliner looked. Different than anything I have seen from BMW. The seats were not like the E36 M3 seats that requires a size 34 waist to fit comfortably. The seats were of a sporting nature but was comfortable for this politically correct overweight individual. Comfort was not forgotten in this car! The center armrest came directly from the seven series as did the stereo and navigation system. This particular car was Avus Blue (beautiful) with Silverstone and Black interior. It meant business. It even has two cupholders up front and two in the rear. The interior was selected with the titanium a.k.a. brushed aluminum trim. The wood would have added a luxury touch, but this selection indicated &quot;this is a sports car damn it!&quot;. The foot rest resembled what you would expect in a race car with the M logo imprinted on it.
   When we accelerated out of the dealership , we were somewhat surprised at the low grumble from the exhaust. We were expecting a more pronounced note. When the engine revved up, we noticed the grumble started to turn into a low growl. Civilized but noticeable. It must be noted that this car comes with some special features. A warning signal indicates if your tires are under-inflated and a pleasant female voice indicates when you have taken a wrong turn if the navigation system is on. The lighted stick-shift is reminiscent of a control on a jet aircraft. We also noticed prior to leaving the dealership, that there was no spare tire. We were told due to the engineering of the quad exhaust that it was impossible for a spare to fit. BMW instead, added an inflater, similar to what you see in a Porsche. We asked ourselves what good would the inflater be if we blew out a tire on these massive 18 inch wheels. We then remembered that BMW does not get flats (sic) and we also have access to BMW roadside assistance.
When my companion &quot;launched&quot; the M5 down the street, I was sucked back into the seat and it reminded me of a roller coaster ride on the first drop. The torque was incredible and the acceleration numbing. We both looked at each other, our mouths open, then we smiled and said lets head to the highway. Since I was the &quot;lucky one&quot; who talked John into putting down the deposit, I would have the option to drive the car during the second half of the trip down to Boca Raton. Option? I didn't have to be asked twice.
   I get behind the wheel of this car and we re-enter the highway and I immediately notice how comfortable the ride is from a drivers perspective, smooth, not too bumpy, something my wife would get in.  The smooth six speed shows why BMW makes the best transmissions in the world. The engine had gobs of power at any RPM range in any gear. It was simply THERE.
We motored through traffic and the handling was remarkable. How could this be? I asked? Oh yeah, it is a BMW, I had almost forgot, I thought I was in a Viper except I could fit my kids in the back. Speaking of Vipers, we both realized what a deal this car is for the price! We were in some traffic, when a Dodge Viper GTS pulled up along side of us, with boy racer behind the wheel as well. He knew what he was looking at and he just eyed the car up and down. My partner (partner in going to jail that is!) told me to nail it, I looked at him with a &quot;this is your car, are you sure&quot; look. He told me not to embarrass the BMW mark and launch! I launched as did the Viper and we had some open road and we stayed side by side, 80 mph, 100 mph, 120 mph; by this time I indicated to my partner that we are approaching jail time speeds and that this was a new car, he told me, &quot; don't dare lift your foot until he does!&quot;. At this time I shifted into fifth gear and we propelled to an astounding 145 Mph and the Viper was still next to us.  Realizing, I have a family and I really didn't want to spend the night in jail, I lifted. Call me a wimp, but this was I-95!  I-95 in Florida, the home of the Geritol driver with blue hair and poor sight! The Viper lifted as well and we soon came up to a more populated area and my friend (anyone who lets you run his car to 145 has to be your friend!) and I looked over at boy racer in the Viper and he just looked and shook his head and gave us a nod of approval. I yelled to him out the window &quot;and I can carry a load of groceries and take the kids as well (not at those speeds of course)&quot;.
   Everything BMW said this car would be, it is, and more. This car is worth more than it's list price of $69,970 plus $2100 gas guzzler tax! This car is truly the ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE. This machine is a shoe in for 2000 Car of the Year. I'll take bets on it. Just remember to have a bank account to pay for allthose tickets you will get. This is a true license loser as I have ever come across one. Just remember not to race the Viper, Ferrari, or Porsche with the wife and kids in the car. First your wife will want the car from you and the kids will start bragging all over town. Next your are the slum of the neighborhood, the bad daddy that speeds all over town. I could think of worse things. Give me an M5, I like eating the Porsche 911's for lunch and the Ferrari F355's for dinner.<br><br>
