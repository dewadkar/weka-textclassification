            The Olympus D-340 R is my first experience at owning a digital camera.  I read several reviews after I saw it listed as being on sale at Best Buy.  I was impressed with the picture resolution, and was able to enlarge pictures to 8&quot; x 10&quot; with little degradation in quality.  I was also impressed by how long the batterys lasted.  I had been warned by friends that this type of camera ate batteries.  I was able to take about 50 high resolution pictures and preview most of them on the small LCD screen, and then even down load them to the computer on the same batteries.

The camera came with an 8 Meg. Smartcard, which will hold about 18 High resolution pictures.  Best Buy was promoting this camera and so they included a 16 Meg. Smanrtcard with the purchase (a $50.00 value). It has a 3x digital zoom, but no optical zoom. I did not find the digital zoom all that exciting as you had to take pictures in low resolution to use this feature. Besides, the software included would all you to blow up the picture taken in high resolution.

Software included with the camera would also allowed you to adjust the contrast and color of the picture before printing.  Another software package included with the camera allowed you to create panorama pictures.  You select the pictures and the software stitches them together.  A really neat feature.

Overall I was very impressed with the camera, especially as it was under $300.
