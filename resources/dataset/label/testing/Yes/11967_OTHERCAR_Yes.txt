            The first time I laid eyes on my 1996 Sunfire Convertible, black on black, I knew that I had to have it (even though it was a 5-speed and I did not drive standard!)  After two weeks of serious consideration, I bought the car -- that I couldn't even test drive!!!  Well, I quickly learned to handle the 5-speed and learned that this car defines freedom!  There is nothing like putting the top down and hitting the highway.  It handles like a dream and seems to respond to whatever I give it...does ok in a 1/4 mile pass too, considering it is only a 2.4L engine!  My friends told me I would be lucky to break 18 seconds, but I am proud to say that I have the timeslips showing a 16.2 sec pass, with no modifications except a K&amp;N air filter.  This is really my dream car.  It handles great on ice and snow with the ABS braking and downshifting.  The front wheel drive gets me through pretty much anything.  I have had 5 adults in this car (for a short trip, granted), but everyone said that they were ok for space, even in the back seat. And being a commuter, I am thrilled with the mileage! I have only had 1 problem in the 4 years I have had the car, the wiper motor died the second winter.  It was still under warranty so it was no cost to fix.  I would buy this car again, but am hopeful to have this one around for awhile!<br><br>
