            The 2000 Camaro SS was one of two finalists vying to be my first ever Brand New Car. It was edged out by the Trans Am I bought instead, but it was definitely a serious contender. 

I'd gone in to the Chevy dealership interested in looking at a used Corvette. There were several such beasts on their lot, but they were all just a little out of the price range I wanted to pay. &quot;Got anything I might like that <i>is</i> under thirty grand?&quot; I asked the dealer. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, pointing across the showroom floor, &quot;The Camaro SS is right about that price.&quot; 

So we took one for a drive. Sitting in the car, I was favorably impressed by the comfort of the seats, and noted that I was higher off the ground than I was in my old Mazda RX-7. Adjusting the mirrors, however, I found the controls for the power mirrors a little awkward -- rather than flipping a switch to choose which mirror to adjust, then having a 4-direction switch to move it with, there was a small knob that had to be twisted to choose the mirror, then manipulated to adjust. Once adjusted, though, visibility was better than in my RX-7. 

I test drove a 4-speed automatic Camaro SS, which came with leather upholstery and power driver's seat among its extensive standard equipment package. No sooner had I turned out of the dealer's lot and onto the street than a tap of the accelerator pushed the car ahead much more quickly than I'd expected. &quot;Whoah,&quot; I said, and turned to head for the freeway. Merging into traffic was a breeze -- plenty of immediate acceleration thanks to the 320-hp, 5.7 liter V8 engine, and quick responsive braking. The car easily reached freeway speed and there was plenty of zip left -- there'd be no way to push this car to its limits under normal driving conditions, even considering California traffic. The ride was excellent for a sportscar, and it was easy to drive with confidence. Oh, who am I kidding? It was downright fun. 

I noted the steering wheel featured auxiliary controls for the radio, but lacking time to familiarize myself with them, I didn't really check them out. All too soon, we were back at the dealer's lot, and I was taking a look at the rest of the car. With the back seats folded down there was quite a good amount of storage, and even with the seats deployed, there'd be enough room to carry baggage for an overnight trip or pick up a decent load of groceries. You'd never use it for a serious cargo vehicle, of course, but that's hardly the point of a Camaro. Similarly, you'd never use it for a serious passenger vehicle, but again, if you want a serious passenger vehicle, you shoudln't be looking for a Camaro. 

In short, though, the car was everything I was looking for: something sporty, with plenty of zip, fun to drive, that you could still use to dash out to the store. Another important requirement for me was that I need to be able to transport my 2.5-year-old son in his car seat -- again, no problem in the Camaro, which even had tether strap mounting points for a child's car seat. 

The only problem was, I really couldn't see myself in a Camaro. I couldn't stop the &quot;Bitchen Camaro!&quot; song from running through my head, and I wasn't in love with its looks. I didn't want to spend $25-30K on a car I wasn't in love with. I felt like I could have developed a comfortable relationship with the Camaro, but I wanted to be swept off my feet. So I went up the street to the Pontiac dealer, to flirt with a Trans Am and see what that chemistry was like. 

Where I'd liked the Camaro, I loved the Trans Am, and to make a long story short, that's what I bought (see my review of the 2000 Firebird Trans Am). What I want to comment on now are a couple of the differences between the Camaro and the Trans Am. 

First, I was intrigued that the Chevy dealer had close to 2 dozen Camaros, half of which were the SS trim level, and almost all automatic transmissions, while there were only about a dozen Firebirds at the Pontiac dealer, and the only automatics were the base Firebirds -- no automatic Trans Ams in stock. The Pontiac dealer had a bunch of base Firebirds, both coupe and convertible, as well as 3 Trans Ams (coupe and convertible) a Firehawk, and a very sexy Ram Air that had just come in -- but none of the V8s were automatic transmission. Since bad knees have forced me to give up driving stick, I was definitely in the market for an automatic. 

Apart from how they look, Camaros and Firebirds are virtually identical cars. However, I found the controls (like for the power mirrors) to be more intuitive in the Trans Am. The appearance of neither is really what could be called modern, apart from the digital odometer/trip miles counter. The stereo looks downright 1980s -- of course, that's probably fine, I imagine it would make a less appealing theft target, and it's easy to work and sounds great.

In the final analysis here's what drew me to the Trans Am over the Camaro: exterior styling and appearance, first and foremost, and something about the feel of the controls. Also, there was a larger rebate for the Trans Am so I'd be able to get the same car for less. And there are fewer Firebirds on the road, while it seems like I see Camaros all over the place. Last but not least, I could <i>definitely</i> see myself in a Trans Am.

It's a mystery to me why Mustangs are outselling Camaros and Firebirds. Every way I look at it, even thinking about the base coupes with the V6 engines, a Camaro or Firebird looks to me like a lot more car for your buck than the equivalent Mustang. Appearancewise, I believe they both look far more attractive than the new Mustangs. Is it just that there are better songs about Mustangs? A small galloping pony looks sexier than a screaming chicken? I don't mean to rag on the Mustang -- a top of the line Mustang is nothing to sneeze at -- but a top-of-the-line Mustang is priced competitively with a Corvette. If I were going to spend $20K on a V6, I guess I could see buying a Mustang if I liked how it looked, but I'd be much more drawn to either a Camaro or Firebird. And when you get into the V8s, why does a 4.6-liter, 260-hp car outsell a car with more than a liter greater displacement and 45-50 more horses?

I suppose I wouldn't even be curious about that if it weren't for the impending discontinuation of the Camaro and Firebird, supposedly due to poor sales as compared to the Mustang. And that brings me to my closing comment, I guess: if you're looking for a car in this league, look now, and look at the GM candidates, before it's too late and there's only one choice left. Trust me, you'll be sorry never to have checked out a Camaro or Firebird.<br><br>
