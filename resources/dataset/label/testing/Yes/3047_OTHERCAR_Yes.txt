            I have had a few Jaguars in my time, and in the past i have felt that the cars were not manufactured that well.  I've had doors unhinge themselves after being closed normally, handles break off, new engines quit, and much more.  But the new Jaguar XK Series breaks that chain.  Jaguar has finally made a car that not only looks great, but also works.  It is a speed machine, believe me when i tell you.  I can hit 80 miles per hour in this thing and feel like i'm barely at 50.

The make, design and feel of this car are what make it exceptional.  Great job Jaguar, you are no longer just a pretty boy of luxery cars, you finally made an awesome automobile that works. Keep it up, because this car has made me a Jaguar owner for life, and i now can trust it to not quit on me in the snow, and that is a great relief.<br><br>
