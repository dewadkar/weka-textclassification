            I recently just purchased a new Frontier 2000 Crew Cab to replace my Nissan Pathfinder.  Although I loved my Pathfinder, I've found the Crew Cab to be a better fit to my needs.  I'm in to a lot of outdoor sports, and found that through a lot of these activities I ended up trashing the inside cargo area of my Pathfinder.

The new Crew Cab affords me almost the same amount of interior room as the Pathfinder.  Granted, the leg room's a little tighter in the back, but I don't have passengers back there often and some rather tall people have fit back there.  It works great for kids if you have a small family.  The other benefit I've found is that although the bed is shorter than a standard 2-door compact pickup, it still has a lot more cargo room than my Pathfinder did.  And, I'm planning to get a camper shell for the back which will allow me to haul a good amount of gear protected from the elements.  Another benefit of the four door design is it allows for more room to maneuver and recline the front seats than a standard 2 door pickup, which means the passenger can catch some Z's on those longer trips.

The ride is great, handles quite well on the more curvy roads I've driven around Lake Tahoe.  I've added new rims and tires and have found you can put 31x10.5's on with only slight modification to the front suspension.  Because it's a new truck, there are no lift kits available as yet.  The sound system in the SE is fairly decent, but I'm a music fanatic and will most likely be replacing the system with a higher powered system.
