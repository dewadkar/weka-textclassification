            This summer will be my seven year anniversary with my 1993 Geo Prizm.  I bought this car when I graduated from high school.  I gathered up my hard earned money and purchased what I now call the &quot;Black Beauty&quot;.  

I was always jealous of my friends whose families were able to afford more expensive cars, but I made do with what I had.  As it turns out, this car has been nothing less than dependable.  

I have taken it back and forth to the Bronx an uncountable amount of times (being a huge Yankee fan and Manhattan College student).  Just imagine the wear and tear the car must have been through on those pot hole city streets--but still never a problem!!!!!  

This car has also been on several road trips.  Being a college student I would have to visit friends in far away places.  For example, one summer my friends and I drove the black beauty all the way up to Vermont to the best keg party imaginable!  Just think with an unreliable car we may have missed one of the best parties of the summer! Needless to say, the car is still in excellent shape for what I paid and I would say I have several more road trips to take with the Black Beauty!<br><br>
