            The Saturn SL series is well-designed for smaller driver and a maximum of 3 small adult passengers.  While on the road, the SL2 handles well, has adequate engine performance (if the driver does not require a high performance automobile).  

With 18,000 miles logged, the only hint of a problem was a &quot;Check engine&quot; light that disappeared after one day.  The dealer service representative said with authority that the problem was bad fuel.

The primary problem area was comfort for the driver.  Getting into the car is a problem.  If I try to get into the car with the tilt steering wheel down, it is an impossible task.  In our home, this is a common problem because of the different driver preferences.  If I drive it after my wife, the tilt wheel must be moved up.  The problem is that I don't know that the steering wheel is down until after I attempt to get into the car and find that I can't do it.

Two noises take some adjustment for the new driver.  The anti-lock brakes have a unusual noise, like the wrinkling of aluminum foil, when first starting the car.  After the car is started, the noise doesn't occur until the engine is stopped and started again.  The other noise is the engine itself.  It is noisy engine.  The salesman said that the timing belt, used to provide a more reliable engine, also gives additional noise. 

Once in the car, the plush upholstery is too soft and I sit too low for my personal comfort.  Thus driving, although not uncomfortable, could be improved if the seats were higher and more firm.

Replacing the brake light in other cars was a two minute effort when you have the light.  With the Saturn, this means a special tool to remove the tail light plastic and then it is like any other light.  If you don't have that tool, you will have a problem.<br><br>
