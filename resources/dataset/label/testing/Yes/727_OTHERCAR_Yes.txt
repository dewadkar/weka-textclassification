            I�ve had the 1997 Eclipse Spyder GS-T for over 2 years now and have enjoyed every minute of it.  It�s got all of the things that makes make a convertible sports car fun: big engine (210 hp), agile, easy roof controls, comfortable and good looking to boot.  It�s actually pretty practical as well � so long as you don�t live in the mid-west (it�s not much fun with the top up) and you don�t often have more than one other person with you (the back seat is only useful in a pinch).  

If you are thinking of buying this car, there are a few things you should know:  1) It�s got terrible blind spots if you have the top up (kinda scary actually).  2) It�s turning radius is about as big as a eighteen-wheeler (u-turns are tricky) 3) The road noise can be pretty loud if you are a commuter.  That said, I love the car.
