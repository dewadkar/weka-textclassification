            I have had many cars over the years including:
 
1995 Eclipse GSX Turbo, 1995 RX-7 Twin Turbo, 1996 Acura 2.5TL, and two Honda Preludes (1995(SI) & 1998), but the new Accord Coupe EX-V6 is the BEST overall combination of looks, ride quality, ergonomics, luxury, and perfomance that I have ever owned by far!!

The engine rated at 200hp must be a low estimate, because I have blown away a BMW 528i, Porsche Boxsters, 300ZX's (non-turbo), Supra's (non-turbo), Integra GS-R, and countless other cars that claim better numbers according to car magazines. 

The only quicker cars (Stock) that I have owned were my Mazda RX-7 Twin Turbo (wheel hop was so bad I could not punch it off the line), and my 1995 Prelude SI 5-speed manual (which was actually faster than my 1998 Prelude that I had traded for my current Accord Coupe).

For the money, this car is the best value in America!

Totally loaded with factory rear-spoiler, splash guards, moonroof, leather, incredible sound system w/steering wheel mounted controls, and the best engine (3.0L VTEC) in any car under $40,000, this car cannot be beat by anything else in its class.

With 34,000 miles on the odometer, I have upgraded the wheels to 17" Konig Tantrums with Yokohama Avid H4 215/45 tires, and added a K&N Filtercharger.
Running with Mobil-1 synthetic oil since the start, this car is faster (0-100mph) with an Automatic transmission than my 1998 Honda Prelude was with a stick!

Top end speed on the car is still a mystery, as I had to let off the pedal at 140mph once with the speedometer needle still going!

The only thing I would like to see from Honda is a 5-speed Automatic (tiptronic-like) transmission, along with a 1.5-2.0" drop with stiffer springs for better handling and looks. Also, some cool colors like Black Cherry Pearl or Electron Blue Pearl would really look awesome on the coupe model.

However with my new wheels and tires, my Accord now feels as if it is on rails even at high speed corners with NO tire squeal.

If anyone is considering any other car besides the Accord Coupe EX-V6 in the (Under $40K) price range, forget about it. 
With the factory rear spoiler, K&N Filtercharger, larger wheels/low-profile tires, and running Mobil-1 synthetic oil, you will have the best performing and looking car in the $25-$40K price range!!

Don't believe the reviews by Motor Trend and other German biased car magazines, this car does 0-60mph in 7-seconds FLAT. 0-100mph in 20-seconds FLAT.

If considering the Acura CL because of the bigger engine, save yourself $3000-$6000 and go with the Accord EX-V6 Coupe instead. The Accord is 300 to 400 pounds lighter and will outperform the base 3.2CL and almost go neck-in-neck with the 3.2CL Type-S.

Drive everything else, then go drive an Accord Coupe EX-V6. You will never want to go back to your old car again!!!

Now I am just waiting for a Turbo/Supercharger for my 2000 Accord so I can start laughing at the new Corvettes, Porsche 998's, and the other $50,000+ cars as I pass by them waving GOODBYE!!
