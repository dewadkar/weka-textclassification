            I purchased a 2002 Saab 9-5 Arc sedan in August, 2002.  Before taking the plunge, I considered the BMW 5 series, the Lexus GS, and the Lexus ES.

I test drove all four cars.  The Saab 9-5 ended up feeling like a combination of the other three.  It had the tight controlled feel of the BMW without the harshness.  It added some of the softness of the Lexus, but with more road feel.  Like the slogan says, "Most people who test drive a Saab usually buy one."

The Arc has a 6 cylinder turbo engine.  It is quiet and has a great deal of torque.  If you engage the "sport" setting on the transmission, there is more power than you'll ever need.  I noticed no turbo lag on the Saab.

The interior is very roomy for five people.  Even the middle rear seat is comfortable.  All seats are heated, including the rear.  Both front seats have a wonderful ventilation system.  I never thought I would use it, but what a blessing in the summer.  The fans in the seats add a bit of noise to the interior, but not at all objectionable.  The stereo is fantastic.  The cup holder in the front is an ingenious design that folds out like a butterfly.  I wish there were two of them instead of one.  All controls are easy to reach.  There is a "night vision" instrument panel which allow you black out all panel lights except the speedometer.  This is a great feature on a very dark country road.  The Saab's interior leather has the nicest leather smell of any car I have ever been in.

The Saab 9-5 is a great value.  Vehicle maintenance is included for three years.  I expect to keep the car for a long time.  Wish me luck.
