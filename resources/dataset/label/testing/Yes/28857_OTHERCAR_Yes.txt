            The Kodak DC210 is a pretty good camera, yet is has began to be quite outdated. 

I have now used the camera for 2 years and I have had no mechanical problems with it. The one megapixel picture quality is quite good for the price. Out of the box I was able to use the camera without reading any instructions. This is a major plus for thoose who seek an entry level camera. The menus are easy to use and connecting to you computer is sort of simple (not as easy as a USB connection). 

I do not recommend to buy this camera new. Kodak has come out with newer models that have better picture quality and improved usability. I suggest you look for this baby on eBay.
