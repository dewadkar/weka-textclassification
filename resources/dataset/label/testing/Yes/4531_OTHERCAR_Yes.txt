            I purchased this camera for around $650 Canadian a year ago, wanting to have it for when my son was born.  I really have nothing but good things to say about this camera.  The few minor cons that I was able to list are really not anything to complain about.

First of all, the image quality is very good.  I generally shoot all my pictures using the 3 megapixel fine setting, feeling that for most of my needs, the 6 megapixel interpolated image is overkill.  The 6 megapixel images are really excellent.  Although they do not fully compare with a true native 6 megapixel image, they are definitely of similar quality to the 4 and 5 megapixel cameras that I have seen and tried.  I took this camera to Australia with me and took some pictures in a wild life reserve.  What impressed me most was the image sharpness and very good colour contrast.  I took some pictures of some very colourful Lorkeets in the reserve and the pictures look fantastic.

The focal lengths on the zoom are also quite reasonable for a camera of 
this size.  The flash, although not all that powerful has worked very well
for me in every situation I have needed it.  

I feel that the unit is quite solid in hand, and seems to be very well built.  I've really enjoyed using it for many different situations.

Although you will not get pro quality movies, the video feature is also really quite nice to have.  It has come in very handy when I wanted to grab a little bit of motion video rather than a static picture.  What I have been impressed with most in regards to the video feature is how well it works in moderate light.  At first I was a little concerned because prior to actually starting to record the video, the image in the LCD looked fairly dark and dim, however as soon as you start recording, the iris in the lens opens wide and you get very good light gathering capability.

If I had to look for some drawbacks to this camera, I would say that the 
battery life could definitely be improved, however the fact that it is rechargeable is nice.  Also, I really wish the camera had a USB2.0 interface, but then again, I have not personally encountered a lot of cameras with USB2.0 as of yet.

So, as you can see I am very happy with this little unit.  Granted it has not replaced my film camera (Canon EOS Elan II) but then again it was never meant to either.  For point and shoot photography, and digital image capture, I think this camera is very hard to beat.
