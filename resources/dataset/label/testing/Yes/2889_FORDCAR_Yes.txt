            I bought my '93 Escort LX Wagon from my grandfather in May 2002. At that point, it only had about 36,000 miles and has given me little problem in the time I've driven it.

<b>Engine/Drivetrain</b>
This Escort has the smaller 1.9 liter fuel-injected with 4-speed automatic transmission.  The engine/transmission combination itself is very reliable, if not always comfortable.  Shifts are often abrupt and labored.  Recently (10/03), on a highway entrance, the transmission did not shift to 4th gear <i>until 60 miles per hour</i>!  Acceleration is minimal.  Fuel economy, however, is excellent, even if not as great as other small cars - roughly 300 miles (up to 400 if all highway) to a 13.5 gallon tank of gas.  On the whole, I'm confident that the car will keep running for quite a while longer, and probably without any major problems.  I drove to Portland, Maine from central Massachusetts, about 150 miles each way, and the car actually started running <i>better</i> about 80 miles into the trip, and there were no problems the entire time.

<b>Exterior</b>
Probably due to the 10-year-old age of this car, it's still very heavy and built out of steel.  It's a structurally solid car, having only one minor mark of the abuse it's been put through.  A low-speed collision with a large Dodge didn't even leave a scratch on this car.  And after ten years, it's still not rusting - the paint is chipped around the grill, but that's the only spot.  

<b>Interior</b>
If you're buying an Escort, you probably do not really care about how nice the interior is.  Mine is, at best, spartan.  Cloth bucket seats are in the front, moderately comfortable without too much room - but it's still roomier than a late-model Toyota Corolla.  Back seats are for children only, I can scarcely fit back there at 5'11".  The instrument cluster is, of course, dated - the only gauges are temperature, fuel, and speedometer, the latter of which only goes up to 80.  The fuel gauge is...unreliable, at best, floating almost constantly.  But you shouldn't expect much.

<b>Options</b>
It's not exactly loaded, but it's far from anti-option.  The Escort came with air conditioning, power mirrors, roof rack, rear windshield wiper, and a cassette deck which I have replaced.  The a/c itself drains too much power from the generally underpowered engine, so I don't use it, regardless of how hot it gets.  The stereo system was mediocre, at best - one speaker died entirely, and the other three vibrate constantly, especially after it just rained.  

<b>Styling</b>
Styling?  What styling?  Even for a 10-year-old station wagon this car is bland and completely unnoticeable, especially with its earthtone mocha color.  At least it will never get stolen.  

On the whole, the Escort is a <i>very</i> good car. There are some problems, such as in wagons of this year, the rear coil springs tend to disintegrate, at least a $600 job.  Apart from that, it's efficient, and gets you where you need to go, reliably, safely, and efficently.  I'd recommend it to someone looking to buy a small, low-priced station wagon, but there's not enough room to warrant purchase by a family, even though there's a fair amount of cargo space.  Newer models are probably a better bet for a cheap, easy to maintain, fairly reliable, utilitarian automobile.  Just don't buy it expecting high performance!

<b>Update</b>
I calculated my gas mileage for the past 10 months in early November to find that the Escort's only getting about 25 mpg in roughly half city/half highway driving, about 10k miles a year!  Watch out for this on older models of the car, this is very poor mileage for an economy car.
