            We bought a Prizm LSI after several months of searching. We did extensive research in the various trade publications and on-line. The Prizm was well rated and in the price range we were targeting (around $15,000). After the first month of test driving and reading, we narrowed the field to the Nissan Sentra, the Mazda Protege and the Chevrolet Prizm. 

We honestly never test drove the Mazda, as the local dealer treated us very poorly so we left. We did drive the Sentra though, it was a good car.

In the end, we chose the Prizm for it's price vs. the competitors. The Chevy dealer was willing to work with us to give us a great deal. Other than minor styling differences, the cars are very similar.

We continue to be happy with the Prizm 6 months later. The car gets excellent gas mileage and makes a great &quot;around&quot; town car. It's got a very large trunk for a car its' size, if you get the LSI, you'll get fold down back seats to increase the storage capabilities. If you're interested in headroom, skip the sunroof, as you'll loose several inches. 

Even with the automatic, the Prizm LSI has excellent &quot;pep&quot; for merging onto business highways and the like.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a car that does local commuting very well and longer trips admirably. The ride is slightly firm, but very typical of a smaller car. If you're looking for lots of leg room in the rear, you won't find it in this car, but you can get four adults into the car for reasonably long trips.

I cannot think of anything I dislike about the vehicle. It's a very well manufactured and designed vehicle that will make many drivers happy.
