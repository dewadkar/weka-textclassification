            The first thing you notice about the new Suburban is its size.  It's big.  It's very big.  Okay, it's huge.  But if you've got teenagers in soccer and drama class like we do, it's the perfect vehicle.  I went with the 2 wheel drive version.  It's fully equipped with rear air and all the other bells and whistles.  It seats 8 full sized people in relative comfort.  I'll never go back to a minivan.  We have room for luggage, coolers, food, and all the related stuff for a vacation, soccer tournament or out of town company.  Seats fold in several different arrangements to suit hauling people or stuff.  You can actually go out to dinner with another couple and bring the kids without having to take 2 cars.  Handling is not exactly nimble, but you can get used to it pretty fast.  Parking in tight spaces is a challenge.  It's not an economy car.  Our mileage ranges from 16 mpg on the highway to around 14 mpg in town.  We're in Texas and around here they have great resale value.  Most people easily will put 100,000 miles on their suburbans before they trade them in and they still bring a premium value.  It's a big, heavy, safe and useful vehicle.  Expect to pay around $30k to $35k for a well equipped model.<br><br>
