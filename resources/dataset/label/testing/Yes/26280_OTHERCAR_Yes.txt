            Well I was driving along in a Civic that I bought and decided to check out its performance. Not on the race track, but with the lucious women of Latin America. The same chicks you see on Univision (see my Univision review to increase your viewing pleasure). So I pull into this pub in some Latin American country (there were so many) and go in to try my luck. Now it would seem my luck was running short that night. So I walk out empty handed into the parking lot. Then as I turn on my car I saw a great light. Then I looked under the street light and saw multiple lucious naked Spanish women. They all wanted a ride in my car! So of course I let them in and we go cruising. Then at some light some guy flashes his racing lights at me. My chicks flash him and then we were ready to race. Now I normally would have won, however the increased weight from the 11 naked spanish chicks in the car/trunk weighed the car down just enough for me to lose the race. Whats the moral of the story? Most guys who watch Univision can't speak Spanish.<br><br>
