            The FinePix 2600 was touted for its picture quality, and I have found nothing over a year of use to make me question this.  I am a pro photographer and I have two $grand digital bodies, but this little gem is my take along camera for trips with friends and family pictures.  Highly recommended if you don't expect to be ink jet printing any pictures larger than 5x7.  Perfect camera for the Web.

Sure it has its quirks that you need to get used to:  the lens cover sometimes gets in the way if you don't 'snap' it open. I much prefer having the lens cover, however!  The menus use pictorial icons which can be a little disconcerting if you haven't studied the manual enough to really know what each symbol means.  Erasing one frame is a little unnerving! The viewfinder LCD screen is exposed to scratching, so you need to have a cushioned case to protect it...a common fault among all pocket digitals.

I have thrown a lot of difficult situations at this camera, and it has handled almost all very smoothly.

I found battery life to be fine, but I charge every night after using the camera during the day (usually on a trip). The rechargeable NiMh batteries are not prone to memory like NiCad batteries.  I like the flash a lot, it is not underpowered and doesn't exhibit exaggerated hot spots. It really can fill a normal sized room with light, very impressive.

Now at this date (Oct. 2003) this camera is available new on eBay in the $140-$150 area including 16mb card, NiMh batteries and charger...an UNBELIEVABLE deal for a camera of this capability.  I just bought another for my mother, who is no technical whiz and will require coaching and a friendly camera.
