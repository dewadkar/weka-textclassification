            What do I think of this camera.  Well, as a former professional photographer I can truly say this about it:  It's great - it's lousy - depending on how you plan to use it.  Read on...

There is a lot to like at about Olympus as a camera company and about the Olympus 340....but there are also a few caveats.  Here's my experience with this nifty little pocket camera which I would recommend for &quot;grab shooting&quot; at family affairs - as long as you don't require prints larger than 5x7.  Grab it for $175 or less and you may be happy...but there are caveats.  Read on...

EASE OF USE

My 340 is easy to use.  Almost TOO easy!  I particularly like the integrated cover that slides over the lens to protect it and at the same time serves as the on/off switch.  Nice move, Olympus!  I wish other manufacturers would take a tip from Olympus on this.  Particularly on some of their high end models that have lens caps that fly off!  (The guilty shall remain nameless...for the moment!)

The 340 fits nicely in the hand, is intuitive to use, and doesn't overwhelm one with gizmos and doo-dads to complicate what should be the simple task of grabbing a fast &quot;snap&quot; - which is, afterall, what this little gem was designed for.

Point, shoot, bang - done!  You get a reasonably good images and the light metering system does a passable job of balancing for good image capture.  There is a bit of color problem...but you have to look closely on 3x5 prints.  Even so, you can easily tweak them in any image editing program.

IMAGE QUALITY

Sorry, if you are looking for a camera that will compete with even the cheapest 35mm unit in terms of producing a decent 8x10 print, the 340 is NOT the camera for you.  For &quot;grab&quot; shots at birthday parties that will remain in LESS than 5x7 size...the 340 does a good job.  Just don't try to blow up a picture to 8x10 size and print it.  You will NOT like what you see; a grainy, pixillated not passable print.  3x5;s are GREAT!  5x7's are OK.  8x10's are, well, shall we say, &quot;Ugh&quot;?

DOWNLOADING IMAGES

Here's where Olympus REALLY TRIPPED UP. The 340 camera does NOT offer USB port compatibility!  Can you believe it!  This is, after all - the New Millennium (or for you purists - the last year of the Old Millennium)!  Either way, WHAT WAS OLYMPUS THINKING when it decided NOT to include USB.  

The result of no USB?  Simple: Prepare to grow old and tired WAITING for your shots to download.  It is an awkward, tiresome, time-consuming task.  THIS is what I find to be the biggest drawback with the 340.  It is just darned INCONVENIENT to download from it.  Needlessly so.   Yes the camera comes with this and that gadget and &quot;option&quot; (spell that - spend more money) that will ease the download wait a bit.   But why, oh, why would one PAY for this, when most new units on the market now come WITH USB.

BOTTOM LINE

Decent 3x5 and 5x7 images.  Nice camera body design.  Minimum high res. capture ability and 8x10's are - well - BAD.   Also, no USB - so downloads take too long.  Am sure Olympus will fix this in future, but less than 2MegaPixel cameras are already becoming Model T Fords in this spaceship oriented 2M+ camera world.  Except for grab shots and use with a non-USB computer, save your dollars and buy something a bit better WITH USB for downloading (if, of course, your computer has a USB port).

Good shooting!
