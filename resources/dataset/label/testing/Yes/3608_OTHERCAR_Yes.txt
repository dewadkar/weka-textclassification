            This spring when GM started shelling out huge incentives to move customers into a new vehicle, I snapped them up, turned in my 1998 Jimmy lease 6 months early and moved into a new 2000 Envoy. It is the best move I've made in a long long time.

Body style-wise, there are mainly subtle differences between the parent Jimmy and it's offspring, the Envoy. The door panels have a richer look with the larger bottom panels. The grille is different, there are the new &quot;blue&quot; high intensity headlights and rearranged driving lights and the rear spoiler adds a sporty look to the back. 

Inside, the designers at GMC are reaching out to rival other entrants into the luxury SUV market. The two-tone leather seats are soft and supple with many different power adjustment options. The wood detailing is minimally used to add accents, not weigh the interior look down. The gear shift is slightly different with a sleeker look and feel. There are controls on the steering wheel for the stereo which my other vehicle didn't have. 

To me, it's the little luxuries that make this truck worth more and endear it to me again and again. The homelink system is handy, no more garage door openers sticking around. The air pump in the rear is a treat when at the beach to blow up floaties, etc. The ride leveling is handy too for taking car trips and hauling things. The electronic fold-in side mirrors seem a little silly but I've used them when I misjudge my range to the ATM or drive-through window. The 6-cd changer keeps me from having to bend over, retrieve new cd's, eject, replace and put away disks while driving down the road. My husband appreciates the automatic climate control and I believe it keeps the comfort level steadier than the typical human-controlled variety. I love the automatic 4-wheel drive feature in addition to the 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel hi and low options. And my children's favorite feature, the rear-seat stereo controls. With them, my children can listen to alternate programming on headphones. It works out well, they don't have to listen to my music and I don't have to listen to the Pokemon soundtrack AGAIN.

Underneath the &quot;stuff&quot; this Envoy is better than the '98 Jimmy as well. Yes it's still the same engine, for a little while longer anyway, but the ride is so much better. And the steering and braking are vastly improved over the earlier models. While the steering on the Jimmy was never binding or hard, the Envoy is smooth, quick and tighter. 

Keep in mind GM is completely re-designing the Envoy with a mid-2001 delivery of 2002 models. If the sneak peeks at the new Bravada are any indication, it will only get better. There will be a newer and quicker 6 cylinder engine to go along with the new styling and our salesman said not to be surprised if a rear-seat t.v./vcr was an option.<br><br>
