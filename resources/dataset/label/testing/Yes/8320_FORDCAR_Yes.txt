            When I was a teenager, Ford produced some Probe Concept cars.  Even though at the time there were no production Probes available, I thought they were really neat and fell in love with them.

When the first Probes came out in production I was happy, but also disappointed because they really didn't look that cool.  In 1993 when Ford changed the body style, my enthusiasm returned.  Later that year I bought a Probe GT and have been happy with it ever since.

The Probe GT is the sport model of the car.  It comes with alloy rims, sport tires (Goodyear Eagles), 2.5 liter v6 engine and a 5 speed transmission (no automatic for GT) with a top speed of 140mph (I've had mine up to 120mph and could have kept going, but there was a cop in front of me).  The options that I got were power windows, power door locks, power driver side seat and a cassette player.  It also comes with a driver side airbag, ABS disc brakes and of course seatbelts.

The front seats were comfortable for my height (5' 8&quot;).  I've been on very long road trips where the only breaks that I took was for gas.  These seats really fit me like a glove.  However, the back seats will only seat children comfortably.  

One of the really surprising things about this car is the trunk.  Most sport cars have a small trunk, but the Probe trunk space is spacious.  The both rear seats can fold down to create expanded trunk space.  It has more trunk space than a 1997 Mazda Prot�g�.

I've had this car serviced regularly.  It's been spendy, usually around $300, but I have also gone to Ford dealerships for the servicing.  There have been only two problems with the car.  The head gasket started to leak a little oil at around 50k miles, and a rear brake caliper started to leak brake fluid at around 105k miles.

The head gasket problem is a known problem with the Probe and usually occurs at the time that I noticed it.  I had that fixed at 70k miles for about $150.  The brake caliper problem cause is unknown.  I believe that I may have hit something on the freeway to start the leak.  I had this fixed at 114k for about $750.  If I had gone somewhere else to fix the brakes it would probably be cheaper because the dealership replace both rear calipers saying that they only came in pairs.

Other than that I've only had to replace the tires.  I bought Nitto tires at $106 per tire, they are a harder rubber than the Goodyear's and I do tend to get more slippage with them under heavy acceleration.  I've done nothing else to the car.  

It does have many squeaks and rattles, and I'm noticing more as the car ages.  As long as the stereo is turned on (which it usually is) I don't notice the squeaks or rattles.

I've enjoyed my Probe immensely and I'm still enjoying it.  It's a fun car to drive and I don't intend to give it up for a while.
