            The BMW M coupe is one of the most hottest performance sports cars out on the market right now. I was lucky enough to have actually driven one last month when a close friend borrowed her brother's new 2000 BMW M coupe. She let me take it for a spin, and it was the most exciting 30 minutes of my life. Even though I am not a very skilled manual-stick driver, the gears and clutch were very smooth and not too hard or soft but just right. The M coupe is very easy to drive, but most people think opposite. They think all sports cars are supposed to be hard to drive with very hard cluthes, but not with the M coupe. This is a car that one can drive around town as well as on the open highway. This car has been designed with the driver's comfort in mind. All the gauges and controls are laid out for easy access. The car is quite tight, but the interior design is just perfect for two people. The seats have great back support and the bucket seats really grip your body. The seats are suitable for long drives because the support is just amazing. This car has incredible power, and all 240 horses are at your every command. The accelerator is very responsive, and the handling is superb. The M coupe will make you feel like you can attack any corner at incredible speeds. The design of the chassis gives the car a really sturdy ride. BMW did not just decide to make the M coupe a hatchback for the heck of it. Hatchback designs have much better handling because of tight stance. The thick rubbers also help out the gripping effort on turns and corners. The M coupe also has quite a low stance that adds to the handling capabilities of the car. The shocks and springs setup are quite tight and sometimes do not soak in bumps, but what can you expect from a car that handles as well as this. The shocks are definitely made for racing and cornering, therefore you should take it a little slow on streets that have alot of potholes and bumps. Many people have mixed feelings about the look of the M coupe, but no one has second doubts about the performance of this vehicle. I personally love the style and lines of this vehicle. The wheels with the low profile rubbers give it the final sporty touch. The front head lights have a projector scheme that can be summed up as just &quot;perfect.&quot; I believe my friend's brother bought his M coupe for 40,000 after taxes. He obviously got a good deal. SO if you are looking for a practical performance machine, definitely consider the M coupe. The M coupe has incredible gas mileage for a car with 240 horses produced by an inline-6. But, it is pretty hard not to push this car hard, which hurts gas mileage. This car has the quality and reliability of all BMW cars, and it has a rather good value. <br><br>
