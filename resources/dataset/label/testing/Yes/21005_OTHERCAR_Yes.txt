            Recently my husband and I decided to trade in two of our three cars and get just one car.  Since my car was the oldest we decided to trade in my car and the company car we were leasing.  I searched on the internet for vehicles I thought I might like and immediately fell in love with the features of the RAV4.  We found one at a local dealer who specializes in vehicles that were previously leased or &quot;gently owned&quot;.  Unfortunately, we were not able to make an acceptable deal on the RAV4 they had.

We decided to go back to the dealer where we had gotten our company car and see if they had anything comparable.  It just so happened that the owner of that dealership also owns a Toyota dealership locally and they had just taken in a 1999 RAV4 with low mileage.  A couple of days later they arranged for us to drive the car.  To make a long story short, it was a match made in heaven.  The car is extremely comfortable to drive and comfortable to ride in, too.  My husband is a big man and has trouble with most seat belts not fitting him properly.  The RAV4 accommodates him perfectly.

Our son says the back seat is very comfortable and never wants to sit up front like most children do.

This not the first Toyota vehicle we have owned.  I previously had a Toyota Previa and absolutely loved that vehicle.  If I have my way, I will only drive Toyotas from now on.  They are extremely reliable and require very little in maintenance costs (just tires, brakes, and windshield wiper blades in a little over five years of ownership).<br><br>
