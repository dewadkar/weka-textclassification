            I've owned the Nissan Pathfinder, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and now own the Explorer Limited.  The Explorer has been the best of the three.  I bought it brand new, and now, 4 years & 50,000 miles later, I have no reason to complain.  I still love it & plan on keeping it for at least a few more years (I usually trade in every 4 years).

So far, there has been no major problems.  The only problem was a month ago & was the catalytic converter heat shield, which was inexpensively removed by the dealer.

There have been a couple factory recalls, including the tires and the cruise control, which were taken care of within a few hours by the dealer.

The car still rides great & has excellent pick up, being a V8 engine.  It is also very comfortable & roomy.  It will easily seat 5 passengers.  The cargo area is also very roomy & the back seats easily fold down to provide additional space.  

It came standard with all the amenities.  The radio includes a tape player & CD player.  The steering wheel has controls for both the radio & heater/AC & there are additional controls for these in the console for the people in the back seat.  There is also a sunroof, leather seats (unfortunately not heated), power everything, compass/outside thermometer & alarm system.

The AWD system has been great through our Michigan winters.  I've never come close to losing control or getting stuck on the snow-covered roads.  

The trailer hitch that came standard works ok to tow my jetski, but if you need to tow heavier things, it's best to have a heavier-duty hitch installed.  

The gas mileage isn't that great, about 15 miles/gallon I think.  But I believe it's comparable to other SUV's.

Overall, it's been a great vehicle & I would recommend it to anyone looking for a SUV for it's reliability & comfort.
