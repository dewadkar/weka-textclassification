            My neighbor purchased the 2000 Ford Focus just before Thanksgiving, 1999.  I immediately took a liking to this car.  My initial response to this car was driven by the aesthetic appearance of this automobile.  The lines are uniquely strong, yet smooth.  The color also caught my attention.  I do not normally find blue cars to be excessively eye-catching.  Usually red cars are best for that purpose (just think about the Dodge commercials).  Anyway this Focus is dark blue, and is an extremely attractive shade of blue.  It has an electric look.

Now I personnally plan on purchasing the Monte Carlo as my next car.  I think this is another attractive model.  However, I have taken a few drives in the Ford Focus, just to make sure I don't want to change my mind.  It would be unfair to compare these two models, because they run about $8,000 difference.  

My reaction to driving the Ford Focus reflect my initial response.  The model I drove cost just over $15,000.  The seats were fabric, and were comfortable to sit in.  The engine is a four cylinder 2.0 litre.  I did not test drive it on the highway, but felt it provided ample power for city driving.  The car was surprisingly quiet, although we did not get the speed up above 50 MPH.

The interior of the car is attractively designed, too.  The equipment console fits the overall concept, with an attractive rounded look.  The controls are easily accessible and visible while driving.  The CD player has a removable face, to deter theft.  The model I drove had manual windows, which rolled up and down with little effort.

My overall impression of the Ford Focus left me with the feeling that the car is well-built, attractive and unique.  I have never owned a Ford product, and am still not certain I will.  However, this automobile held my interest.  I did not test the back seats, but this car appears to be large enough to comfortably seat four average sized adults.  For a family car, this automobile would be more than adequate.<br><br>
