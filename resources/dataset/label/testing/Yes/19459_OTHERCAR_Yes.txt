            We bought this vehicle as a second car.  We own a pickup truck but wanted a second car that had a lot of cargo space. 

I truly love this vehicle.  I can carry all of my school gear, the dog and still have room for heavy duty grocery shopping.  

The only true drawback that I see is the wood grain trim.  It has a tendency to fade with sun and cleaning product application.  Toyota needs to find a means of sealing the trim so that it does not degrade.

I get excellent mileage considering it's size and engine capacity.  My 4Runner is a 1996 and has not had any engine difficulties. I have yet to take it to the shop for any reason.  I do my 3,000 mile oil changes, religiously.

I would definitely recommend this vehicle for quality, price and convenience. <br><br>
