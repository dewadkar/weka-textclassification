            The &quot;F&quot; in the Ford F150 1999 Sport Edition pick-up definitely stands for a fun, fast, and flexible vehicle.  We've waited 20 years to replace our 1976 F150 and this one is so much better.  Our XLT is a Sport model and came equipped with all the goodies including cruise control, A/C, power windows, door locks, and mirrors, the extended cab with four doors, upgraded interior, a decent stereo with CD player, a soft cover for the bed, and great looking body trim.

Our new pickup really takes on the road with it's V-8 engine.  It performs best at about 75 mph cruising down the highway.  I find it hard to keep it under that speed, cause this baby wants to get where it's going.  The truck is pure fun to drive - and a full load doesn't slow it down.  The F150 was built to haul (we've got the fleet side bed) just about anything you want to toss in.  Three people fit up front quite well because the console flips up to make a center seat.  The back seat can hold two adults in reasonable comfort, but three gets real crowded.  Since we normally only ride in twos, this was not a problem for us.  I wanted the back seat for groceries and purchases at the mall.  I don't like to throw those kinds of parcels in the bed.

Ford offered everything we wanted in a new vehicle:  reasonable price, plenty of room to haul people and stuff, up to date styling, and lots of safety features.  Ford also has a great reputation as far as their truck line goes.  With the new suspension, this truck rides great and that tire wear problem that Ford was infamous for has disappeared.

Our truck did come with a small defect that the dealership corrected in one visit to their shop.  Other than that, we haven't found anything we don't like about our purchase.  We would have preferred a keyless entry, but for some reason, this particular vehicle has the standard key lock only.

We feel this is one of the best vehicle purchases we ever made.  The truck ought to hold it's value for years to come and as I said before, the price was very reasonable.<br><br>
