            I'm very impressed with my Canon. It's surprising to get so much camera in such a flashy package. My shots come out beautiful, transfers are fast over the USB cable, and the camera is solid as a brick.

I lent my camera to my buddy for a recent Hong Kong excursion. The pictures he sent back had so much color, it was amazing. Just this last weekend, I took it snowboarding, and was able to tuck into my jacket. I took 45+ shots throughout the day. 

I like the software that comes with it, too. Photorecord is easy to use, and Photostitch attaches panoramic shots quickly and easily. I would recommend Adobe Imageready or even Photoshop too, though, if you're doing any editing.

My complaints? Few and minor. The interface is kinda confusing. I wish the battery life were longer. I wish it came with more than the puny 8 MB flashcard. I wish that there was a way I could use it as a video camera when plugged into my computer. Oh, and it would have been nice if I could record short videos. 

The one major complaint I have is that the camera does not do a great job of capturing action shots. They come out very blurry. I'm told that the S-100 had a high speed shutter setting, I don't understand why this feature was omitted on the S-10, but it's unfortunate.
