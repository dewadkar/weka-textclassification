               <b>I</b>n late 1995 the Grand Prix GTP made its debut at the New York Auto show. A year later, a production version of this car hit the streets. It provides tremendous performance, especially for a family sedan, all for a  reasonable price. It wasn't until 1997 when the Grand Prix GTP really got with it. A 3.8 liter supercharged engine was fitted under the hood making the Grand Prix GTP a real street brawler.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

    <b>V</b>astly improved over its predecessor, the current GTP has a decidedly sporty <b>interior</b>, kinda like a Pontiac Firebird with extra space. It feels tight too; the doors shut with a reassuring clunk, and on the highway there are no squeaks or rattles. The ride is firm, but still soft enough to keep you comfortable, and the powerful 3.8 liter supercharged OHV V6 is almost a revelation in terms of OHV technology. That, together with capable chassis and efficient brakes, makes this car very fun to drive! Torque steer can be a little overwhelming at times, but not too bad for a FWD car with this much power.
     
<b>T</b>he 2001 Grand Prix Comes in the base 3.1 V6 version, SE, and the 'somewhat beefy' 3.8 (3800) naturally asperated GT version with 200 HP, but enough about those models, the GTP is why we are here! It comes with a 240 horsepower supercharged 3800 series 3.8 liter OHV V6, packing with it not only good horsepower but also 280 Lb-Ft of torque at a low 3,200 RPM. This OHV engine combo was first seen in the Bonneville SSEi, and loves to burn rubber in any car GM decides to put it in! The torque at such a low RPM makes this sedan a true street brawler. This basic OHV engine has its orgins in the veterin 3.8 liter Buick V6 which gained notoriety in the turbocharged Grand National and Buick T-Type cars of the 1980s.  

   Although the chassis is based on its predecessor, ('95& earlier models) the current Grand Prix boasts many improvements. The <b>suspension</b> is all new with revised geometry. Sway bar attachment points and a slight negative camber angle on the front wheels. This results in good handling while reducing vibration and harsh feedback over jarring road surfaces. All GTP's have beefed up 4T65-E Automatic transmissions that you won't find in the regular SE and GT trim lines.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the GTP is relatively luxurious, yet is very sporty and loaded to the gills. Amenities are everywhere, and relatively supportive seats are offered for aggressive driving coupled with tons of room up front and rear. AC, power everything, dual air bags, A 6 speaker premium sound system that sounds excellent, and height adjustable seats are offered as standard equipment. The leather seats feel a little cheap, however everything else in the car seems fairly plush. The interior of the GTP reminds me of a luxurious version of the F-bodys.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b> is almost as sweet as its powertrain. The GTP is one of the most sporty looking sedans in the world for 2001. Making the Nissan Atima, the Nissan Maxima, and other sedans in, or close to its class look like granny mobiles. The GTP comes in a 2 door and 4 door, the four door version combines advanced performance with practicality. However the 2 doors look much better/sporty in my opinion.

<i>Pricing:</i> 
    
The <b>price</b> is excellent for these cars. The GTP's are one of the fastest, best looking American family cars you can buy. Starting around $24,000 this is a 'super sedan' that you can't pass up if you are in the market for a cheap luxury/performance sedan.

    GM'S 3800 series V6 located in the GTP is one of the most <b>reliable</b> engines in the world. It is a simple OHV design, but is tough as nails, the same can be said for the transmissions, not only in the GTP, but in all 2001 model GM cars that are lucky enough to have the 3.8 (3800 series) liter engine.
