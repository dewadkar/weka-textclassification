            I bought my 1994 Pontiac Firebird back in 1998 for $10,400.  It had 58,000 miles on it and was in excellent condition - it had obviously been babied.  I think that early maintenance has really paid off, because after another 58,000 miles, it is still going strong.  It's been very reliable.  I can't find an excuse to get a new car!

The Firebird handles very well.  It has a lot of kick (even the V6!), but if you're looking for a quiet car, look elsewhere - it's quite loud.  I think that's part of its charm.

The stereo is great.  The car has all the features I need - PW, PDL, keyless... and the T-tops are really fun.  The front seats are comfortable, but the back seats are tiny.  Definitely not a family car.

In the four years I've owned this car, I think it's been in the shop only twice for anything other than routine maintenance.  That's a more-than-acceptable record for a used car in my book.  The sensors on the steering wheel radio controls have stopped working (what a shame - that's a great option), and I've also had to replace both window motors.

These cars can have a tendency to be abused by their drivers, so if you're buying used, make sure you have the maintenance records and know the history of the car.  If you do that, I think you'll really enjoy your Bird.
