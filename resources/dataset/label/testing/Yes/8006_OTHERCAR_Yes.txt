            I have fond memories of driving the original Jag sedan which the current S type attempts to recall. Small fast sedans. The problem was the total lack of quality control.  The S type has the look of those older sedans, but it's a big, heavy, car.  

The real successor is the X type.  It's small, fast, handles well, and evokes all the traditional Jaguar qualities.  The good ones, that is. Sure, it has some Ford components, but the 356C Porsche was mostly crafted out of the VW parts bin.  For those of us who remember Jags as serious driving cars that were reasonably priced, the X is a real treat.

The car looks bigger than it is: the inside is compact, particularly with a sunroof, and the back seat is for midgets.  Like several other imports, the X type can be had with a long list of options that add ten grand to the base price but Jaguar is to be commended for making the 2.5 with a 5 speed manual transmission available.  The "base" model, which has has everything you need except a sunroof and an automatic transmission (power windows, leather, a cd player, automatic ac, fog lights front and rear) is right at 30 grand, and is definitely the model to buy.  If anyone thinks this is pricey, trot over to the Audi dealership and see what an A4 quattro costs--using what's basically a last generation 1.8 liter four from VW as its engine. 

The fit and finish is a whole order of magnitude better than on previous Jags, and the minor irritations I experienced when I drove one in 2002 have apparently been fixed.  One new one has been added: the doors lock automatically when you move forward or backwards, and they make an extremely irritating CLUNK.  The ac cycles the blower and the recirc back and forth, even when it's not set to "Auto," and the recirculating air control flap makes an equally irritating little squeak.  The ac really works well, by the way.

In terms of comfort and quality, I'd say the X type is about the same as my Volvo S60.  It's smaller inside, gets better gas mileage, even with automatic, and the S60 has some nice touches.  On the other hand, the msrp was a staggering $37,000 for what's essentially a $25,000 car, so you have to make allowances. 

In sum, if you want a small sedan that looks and feels like a Jaguar, and that's a real kick to drive, the 2.5 X with a  speed is definitely a great car.  My wife was in mourning for her 2001 Miata LS, but after a brief drive, she was converted, and now I can't get the Jag away from her.  Enough said.
