            I recently purchased a 2000 Quest. The Quests is a perfect minivan at an awsome price. The start from about 20,000 and go up to 26,000 fully loaded. The Quests has excellent gas mileage and gives a nice smooth ride. There are rear A/C and heat controls so you won't hear the kids screaming, &quot;It's too hot back here!&quot; Along with the rear A/C and Heat controls there are controls for the radio. There are also places where you can insert headphones so the parents don't have to listen to the kid's annoying music! Also a TV can be added to the minivan. I like this TV because it has the plugs to put in a game system such as Nintendo 64. One thing that isn't real good about the TV is that the reception isn't clear within a certain range of the city you live in. Overall, The Nissan Quest is an excellent buy.<br><br>
