            Admittedly, anything I say about a Chevrolet automobile is absolutely biased, my dad works for Chevy, but still, I have driven Camaros ever since I was 17! Time, and time again, I have told friends, &quot;Why get a Mustang, it'll just break down on you.&quot; 

If you really want a qualified opinion about Camaros, I'm the guy to ask. Being the proud owner of three Chevrolet Camaros, I can give you the inside scoop of what it's like to own one -- or three.

My first Z/28 is the 1992 25th Anniversary Special Edition. WONDERFUL car! This year the car is a ripe old age of eight years old, and to be completely honest, Chevrolet put a lot of effort into making its cars dependable and durable, Ford Motor Company can't say that. How many eight year-old Mustangs do you see on the road (the shoulder doesn't count)? Now, not every car is built like a Chevy, and it isn't to say that all Chevys will last as long as mine has. Before you buy your first Camaro you should know that they do require more attention than, say, a Buick. Regular oil changes, air filter changes, etc are a wonderful gift for you car, and a great way to make it last! 

Being the proud owner of a Camaro takes a financial commitment from you! Each and every Camaro is like a child, and naturally every owner only wants the best (primarily the reason they drive Chevys!). TLC is needed! Be gentle and take good care of them! If you respect the car, in return the car respects you. You'll save future monies on unnecessary repairs and services, long as you don't drive like a dick in heat. 

A Chevrolet Camaro is a great buy, and a great car! The LT1 350 and LS1 350 are some of the hottest engines Chevy produces! FORD can't say that their Mustangs come with a 350, the biggest engine they have is a 302! HAHAHA! 

A Camaro gives its drivers performance, good looks, dependability, durability and a great ride! What have the competitors to offer?
