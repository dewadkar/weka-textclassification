            (Sing the title to the tune of "Flying Purple People Eater" to get the full effect!!!)

My mother is not the brightest person, this I have known for 25 of my 27 years (the other two I spent oblivious of things around me).  4 years ago, she called and told me that she had gotten the dream teaching job, and thus, needed a mini-van to haul around all of the endless supply of paper products teachers seem to accumulate.  She had found a cute little red Dodge Caravan that would serve the purpose, and dived right in.

This little piece of "Ram-tough" machinery is the auto I usually drive when I make the trek back home to visit the "maternal unit."  Other than that, it is my mother's faithful everyday companion (she can't have a dog in her complex).


The Van Itself
-----------------------------------------------------------
1997 Dodge Caravan Base, 37,000 miles as of 6/20/01
2.4-liter 4-cylinder buzz bomb (made by Mitsubishi)
Sliding doors on both sides
3-speed auto transmission
A/C, AM/FM cassette, tilt and cruise


Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Mitsubishi-built 4-cylinder is a mismatch with this auto.  It was included in the lineup for economical purposes only, and it is a very plain fact to see when you step on the gas.  Don't expect to win any races, nor pass with authority.  It is geared for economy, and this is what it does best.  Gas mileage is great with a normal load, even better during the winter and spring when the A/C isn't a necessity.
When revved hard to get up to speed, the little engine/tranny combo does tend to lurch into gear with a definite "thud."  
This particular one is the short-wheelbase, and is quite a bit more nimble around traffic than its longer-wheelbased counterpart.  Parking is a snap.  The ride, even with the short-wheelbase, is very good, as we have taken this on several weekend trips when a car wouldn't do.


Convenience Features
------------------------------------------------------------
The dual sliding rear doors are a Godsend.  The low step-in makes it easy for anyone to get in, even the elderly or a 24-year old son with a knack for extreme roller hockey injuries.
The rear hatch is fine, although it lacks an electric lock (dang it, mom!), and clearance underneath it when opened is adequate.


Interior
------------------------------------------------------------
Mom had several choices in options packages (OK, millions, but for simplicity we will classify them into three): Loaded, Wanted, and Spartan.  Guess which she chose, keep in mind my comment at the very beginning???  Yup...
Roll-down windows are a fixture of the 70's.  I hate them.  And the ones on the van are no exception to my rule.  Also, if you do plan on getting this van, make sure you get power locks WITHOUT FAIL.  You will get tired of walking around the car locking all of the doors (and rear hatch) after everyone gets out.  If you plan on skipping this feature, make sure you put a huge sticker on the steering wheel that reads "Remember to remind everyone to lock their door when they exit."  
The cloth interior does a fine job of holding 6 adults and a Boston Terrier (who gets his own seat).  The driver's position is upright and comfy, although lumbar support is lacking.  The rear bench seats lack headrests, but do have the holes for them if you choose to rummage through a parts bin.  The very rear seat will hold to adults like stated, but I wouldn't recommend it for long trips.
Controls are some of the easiest to use and learn, typical Chrysler.  Storage bins are abundant and large.  One tip: the large bin in the center of the dash that slides out (w/cupholders) will rattle if left out all of the time.  The audio unit is very easy to use, but the 4-speaker system was doomed to play "Adult Contemporary" for its lifetime.  Pretty bland...
So far, even after 4 years, the trim has held together well with little or no rattles.


Reliability
-----------------------------------------------------------
Up until 36,500 miles, this vehicle had no problems whatsoever.  Zip.
Routine maintenance is a snap, and although the 4-banger is crammed under the front of the car like most mini-van engines, it is a breeze to reach any fluid level dipsticks and the coolant overflow tank.
Alas, though, enter the "Design Flaw": at 36,500 miles, mom noticed oil leaking.  Yikes.  After a trip to the Chrysler house, we were told that the head gasket was leaking and after a simple payment of $690, we would be on our way after sitting in their brightly-lit waiting room with tons of free coffee and plenty of impatient kiddos running around (they didn't even have a playroom for me, oops, the kiddos!).  After explaining that it seemed odd to blow a head gasket at 36,500 miles and that Chrysler should take care of it since it was only 500 miles over warranty, I was told by the tech that this was a flaw in the Mitsubishi 4-cylinder, and that it usually happens at about 25,000 miles.  "You guys are lucky you lasted until 36,500," he reassured us.  Gee, how comforting.  After alot of arm-wrestling and sticking out my tongue, they agreed to split the cost of the part with us and take care of the labor. 


Overall
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Happy Little People Mover keeps plugging along.  This particular model would serve best for a small family that doesn't care about creature comforts.  
The Caravan is a nice, reliable (ahem) vehicle that keeps selling well and making its owners happy.  It has one of the greatest repeat-owner marks in the industry.
My recommendations: spend a little more cash and get the power options, get the combo CD/cassette player, and make sure the rear seats have headrests if they are benches.
