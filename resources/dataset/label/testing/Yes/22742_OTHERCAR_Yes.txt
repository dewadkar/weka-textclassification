            I bought my 1993 Grand Am GT because of looks, comfort, performance, and affordability.  I have the 3.3L V-6 engine which in my experience requires less work than the twin-cam I-4 (I have a 98 with the 2.4 Liter I-4 based on the design of the 2.3 offering from 1993).  I love the power and the sound of this engine and the looks of the GT (especially the quad exhaust).  Also, the seats are very comfortable.  I wish the V-6 had a more aggressive transmission (3-speed automatic isn't very exiting).  Problems I've had with mine: Leaky trunk (dealer took care of it with no cost), Gas-tank does not always open (even after you fix it), and the shift-solenoid in the transmission went bad (fixed under warranty).  Taking both the good qualities and the problems I've had with the vehicle, I still love to drive it.  It corners well (16-inch rims) and pulls through the gears nicely (smooth shift).  It looks good and has plenty of room for stuff on trips (unlike the 96-98 Grand Ams, these ones back seats fold down).  People who should buy this vehicle are people who don't want to spend a lot of money, but want to travel in a stylish-looking car with a little muscle, comfortable seats, and smile-inducing handling.<br><br>
