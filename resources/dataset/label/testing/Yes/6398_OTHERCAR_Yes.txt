            I bought the car because of the amenities that were offered at a reasonable price - it was hard to beat!  That legendary 3800 V6 engine gives performance and decent gas mileage (which is certainly important these days - 24/32 mpg, depending on how heavy your foot is on the gas pedal).  This car handles very smoothly - it drives like a dream.  The speed-sensitive steering makes it easy to navigate, even in Chicago's traffic jams.  It's very responsive yet not jerky - the ride is always smooth, whether you're traveling at 20 mph or 110 mph (this is NOT recommended for those of you at home).  The interior is very comfortable and well-designed with seats that adjust to your comfort and are firm, not squishy.  The 4-wheel anti-lock disc brake system allows you to stop on a dime without throwing the passengers through the window.  We've taken many 1,400 mile trips in this car and have not regretted it once.  My car has 33,000 miles on it, and I just bought it 15 months ago.

The only con I've seen so far is that GM is following the current trend of using thinner brake rotors than in previous models.  This might be for heat dissipation, but around 30,000 miles, you start feeling rotor warpage and need some brake work.   

I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who wants a comfortable, 4-door passenger car that has a lot of kick.  Unfortunately, the 3800 engine has been replaced by a 3.5 litre engine that has been rated very highly as well.<br><br>
