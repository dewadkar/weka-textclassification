            <b>I needed room, bad</b>
I'm 6'5.  I was driving a Geo Metro.  No, it was not for the circus.  But it <i>felt</i> like I'd been hired by P.T. Barnum himself.  I could drive small cars no longer.

So, if everything is relative, then the day that I climbed out of my Metro and took the Malibu for a test drive, it was like stepping out of a bathroom and into a baseball field. 

But the feeling has lasted.  So, relative or not, I'm still comfortable in my Malibu, and that's saying a lot from someone who has a herniated L4-L5 disc and measures in at six and a half feet, with 240 conservative pounds weighing down my driver's side.  I also have a fetish for wider, lower cars and this one almost fit the profile (it's plenty wide, but it sits a little high for my taste). I also have a weird thing where I have to have a center arm rest, kind of up-high, to rest my right elbow on.  Got it.

<b>Test drive day</b>
We wanted something bigger for a few reasons.  My size, our new baby, and comfort in general.  
First, we hopped in a Prizm and my standard measure is to see if I can drive without my knee hitting the steering wheel or the stereo console.  I felt like nothing had changed in the Prizm.  My right leg was pinned--on the left by the steering wheel and on the right by the stereo or middle controls console.  I thought back to the days that I had my old, beat-up Mitsubishi Montero and how roomy that thing was.  I still had a foot of clearance over my head in the Montero and my legs had the freedom of an ocean buoy on a windy day.  
Anyway, the Prizm was nice for it's price, but it still couldn't fit me.  So we saw a used Malibu; my wife had made mention of it earlier, but at 15 grand, we had decided it was out of our price range.  Or so we thought.

I got in and fell in love.  I had ROOM.  Cd player, rear defrost, reclining seats, center console, large glove box, power windows, power locks, and on and on it went.  Now, I'm fairly easy to please.  I was willing to buy this car even if it had a Fred Flintstone engine in it, because of the extras and I had ROOM!  When we took off, it was like finding a $50 bill in the pocket of a brand new leather jacket you bought for yourself.  The car literally removed itself from one location and placed itself in another.  I can't remember any time passing between those two points.  It has cruise, but it's just not as fun as the alternative. It's not as fast as the little tiny sports cars that are clearly meant to put G force onto your face when you push them, but it gets up and goes for a family-sized sedan. And it had ROOM!

We bought the car, needless to say. We've owned it since December, 2000.  I work 72.4 miles away from home, so I've already put over 25,000 miles on it.  It was at 25,500 miles when we bought it and now, in late May, 2001, it's at 52,000 give or take.

<b>Problems</b>
There have been a couple.  

First, one day on my way to work, the car cut off.  Just... turned off.  I later found out that my gas line had frozen, and I know in cold areas like Vermont most people use "Dry Gas" additives to keep the gas lines from freezing, but it was only a low of about 14 degrees that night, so I didn't suspect it would be a problem.  I remedied it by pouring dry gas in, which goes to work almost instantaneously.  But I believe the gas line may be vulnerable to freezing; perhaps too skinny or too exposed to passing air...obviously not a problem if you live down south.

Second, the ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) light has come on a few times.  My fluids were always good, and I've heard that this is common with Malibus.  The dealer ended up replacing a bearing in the wheel which took care of it (and took care of a "grinding noise" that had started not long after the light came on the second time).  I can't speak of the rumors of the cars having ABS problems, but I know mine came and went and we've had no trouble with it since.

Other than that, NO problems.  And we consistently average <b>26 miles per gallon</b>.

Summary
I don't know if I can properly relate to you how much ROOM is in this car!  I mean, it isn't just the front, but you could easily fit three men my size in the back with plenty of grunt, groan, and elbow room.  I mean, it's comfortable.  The V-6 engine is what allows the car to turn from a family sedan on Sunday to a rocket ship on the way to work Monday.  That's a nice little conversion that used to require two cars.  I've put a lot of stress on this car, through some horrible weather, at 155 miles per day round-trip to work, and she's taken care of me.  The couple of minor problems were worth it to me; what car, new or otherwise, doesn't have a couple of problems that need attention?
