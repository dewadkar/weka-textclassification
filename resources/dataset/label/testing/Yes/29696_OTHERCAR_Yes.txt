            I used to own a 1996 Toyota 4-Runner and I loved it. I figured I would never own another SUV besides a Toyota, until I test drove the Infiniti QX-4. The QX-4 maybe a little bit more expensive then the 4-Runner, but its worth every penny. Here is a list of major differences between the 4-Runner and the QX-4 in no particular order:

1) My 4-Runner drives loose. In other words it doesn't feel put together as well as the QX-4. Unlike my 4-Runner, my QX-4 does not rattle. The QX-4 is a much smoother ride than the 4-Runner.

2) My QX-4 is very quiet on the road. With my 4-Runner I can hear everything that goes on outside my SUV. The QX-4 is sealed very tight.

3) The exterior appearance is a tie. I love the design of both SUVs equally.

4) The interior of the QX-4 is is much more luxurious than the 4-Runner. The QX-4 has the wood paneling (even though it's fake), it has more options (like the built in garage door opener). The leather used in the QX-4 also seems to be of a higher quality.

5) I loved the back door in my 4-Runner. The back window rolled down from the drivers seat. The Qx-4's back window doesn't roll down, it just lifts up. 

6) The back seat of my 4-Runner had more room then my QX-4. I found out the first day I had my QX-4 home, that the back seat was difficult to get in and out of. 

7) The factory wheel covers are more attractive on my QX-4. They are also much easier to clean break dust out of.

8) The factory CD player is a much higher quality as well. You've gotta love this thing. It has a 6 CD changer in the dash. Unlike most others are kept in the glove box or the rear of the vehicle.

9) As far as paint goes, i'm not sure of it yet. My 4-Runner had the best factory paint and tinting job I had ever seen. My 4-Runner is now 5 years old and the paint and tint look as if it just came out of a high priced body shop. My 4-Runner hasn't faded one shade since 1996.

10) Finally, the QX-4 has an optional Nav system. It's rather expensive, but its really cool and definitely worth it.
