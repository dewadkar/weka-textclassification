            The Landrover Defender 90 is the ultimate true off-road 4-wheel drive.  Forget the rest.  This is it.  The only other vehicle I considered when I bought mine was the Hummer.  I felt that the shortcommings of the Hummer and the pricetag put it is second place to the D90. Having driven the Hummer in the Army and rented the D90 in Aussie land and Africa.  There choice was simple.  D90, period.  More options. More Parts. More Fun per buck. This is not a SUV for the daily commute crowd.  This is not mom's stationwagon on stilts.  This is the real deal.  This is the truck you take where others fear to tread.  If you get in trouble with any other vehicle, your on your own.  The D90 will drive itself out of most problems. Just stick in 1st and Low Locked Diff and let it idle your way out.  I use to have a 72 Ford Bronco and a 87 Jeep CJ and neither vehicle gave me the feeling of confidence in any off-road situation. I get a real kick pulling out Suburban's and Expedition's that are buried up to their axles in mud or sand.  I usually don't even have to use more than idle speed to do pull one of these out.

RIDE:The D90 weighs over 1000lbs less than a Discovery.  Which is on the same chassis and powertrain.  It also rides like it weighs a half ton less.  This is not the kidney buster that the CJ is but it's close with standard factory springs.  I changed my springs to the &quot;Old Man Emu&quot; spring and shocks and got 2 inch of clearance and a much better ride.  Not that I needed the extra height or ground clearance.  This is already one of the tallest vehicles on the road.  This truck is the same roof height as a Ford Expedition or F-350 pick-up.

NOISE: WHAT! DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?  This is not the vehicle for the music lover.  First there is no where for the additional amps and speakers. Second, Between the wind noise and the tire roar - I have never used my stereo anywhere except when stopped for a red light. Forget the tape or CD player.  The CD player spend more time skipping than playing.
Simple conversation is a challenge for the hearing normal. 

Great AC, OK Heater.

MILEAGE:  Yes, Virginia. It does get some miles to the gallon. This is not a gas crunch vehicle.  I tell the joke that my D90 have never met a gas station it didn't like. With about 15 gallon tank and highway mileage between 10-14 MPG. You don't want to pass up too many stations. The worst mileage comes when I'm bucking a strong headwind. This vehicle has the aerodynamics of a brick dragging a parachute. But I didn't buy this for the mileage. If that were a criteria of mine then I would have bought a Ford Espire (best named car in the world - it espires to be a real car).

Why Buy this truck over any other vehicle?  FUN, This truck is fun to drive and fun to run around in.  Fun to go places where other vehicles will leave parts along the way to mark their passing.  More SPM (Smiles Per Mile) than any other vehicle you can buy new or used. And in the US this is not a commonly seen truck so it is an instant conversation started every where you go.
