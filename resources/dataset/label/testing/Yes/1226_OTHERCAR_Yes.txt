            When I say that my 1998 Honda Civic is the best car I've ever owned, it's really not saying a whole lot.  Why?  Because the only other cars I've ever owned was a 1994 Ford Tempo (aka Ford Piece O' Crapo) and a 1997 Suzuki Sidekick (that ended up leaking oil from nearly every possible, and some impossible, places that a car can leak oil from).  So really, my review title isn't giving the 1998 Honda Civic all the props it truly deserves.  So, I'm hoping this review does that.

My trusty (so far) silver 4-door Civic has about 63,000 miles on it.  I bought it in June of 2003 when it had about 50,000 miles on it.  SO far, I haven't had to have anything serviced or fixed, other than the routine oil changes and tire rotations.  And trust me, I've put some serious miles on it.  I commute to another state to work, plus visit friends in other states quite often, so I do a LOT of driving.  My Civic gets me to and from everywhere I go in comfort, style and safety.  I can easily drive 90+ mph and the car doesn't act as though I'm straining its engine, and it doesn't make any strange noises.  The pickup from a stop is excellent (the only car that I've noticed has better pickup from a stop is a Mitsubishi Eclipse).  

The car is a perfect size for either me alone, or for the times I have passengers (like at my night job when a bunch of us go for a Dunkin Donuts run).  It has four doors which all function properly, a spacious trunk for those times I need to sneak someone over the Canadian border, and comfortable seats which are good for long trips.  The seats are made of a nice fabric that doesn't get too cold or hot in extreme weather.

My Civic has now been started in temperatures as low as -11, and although it doesn't start quite as quickly or smoothly as usual in those bitterly cold temperatures, it still starts.  The engine warms up very quickly.  In fact, I normally don't have to really warm the car up and it runs just fine.  Just in these brutal low temps we've had lately where it's been hovering near zero degrees, I am forced to let it warm up.  For a car that is about 6 years old, the 1998 Civic runs almost like new.  I've rented several new Dodge Neons and Ford Escorts, and those vehicles don't hold a candle to the way my Civic runs.  Just recently, while visiting California, I rented a 2003 Chevy Cavalier.  Let me tell you, I was dying to get home to my Civic after just a day in the Cavalier.  

One of the best things about the Civic is the turning radius of the steering wheel is EXCELLENT - you can steer that car anywhere and into any tight spot.  Another major plus is the body of the 1998 Civic is stylish and cute.  Still another thing is the smoothness of the drive, no matter what the speed I'm going.  The gas mileage is excellent - it's a four cylinder, and pretty lightweight.  I spend more time than I want to at the gas pumps, but that's my own fault for driving so much!  I also love the feeling of safety I get in my Civic - it has dual air bags, working seat belts and a reasonably roomy interior.  The A/C and Heat (thank goodness!!!!) work great, and you can't beat the price that the 1998 Civic goes for - roughly $6000 - $9000 dollars, depending on how many bells and whistles you are getting.

For people who live in states where it snows:  The 1998 Honda Civic is an EXCELLENT car to drive in winter weather.  The lightness of the car makes it easy and safe to manuever over slippery or snow-covered roads.  The front wheel drive gives it enough power to get going when your tires get stuck in the snow.  (Nothing extreme, mind you - a few inches at most.  I'm not promising that you can drive yourself out of a ditch or snow bank should you get stuck in one!)

My only complaints about the 1998 Civic LE are as follows. I'm sure you'll agree they are very small complaints.  First, that the windshield wipers seem to go bad pretty quickly.  I've had mine replaced three times now since buying the car.  Two, I have automatic windows, but in order for me to lock my car up, I have to get out and lock it from the outside.  So even when it's pouring rain or really cold, I am forced to take the time to put the key in the lock outside of the door.  I guess this is a measure to prevent people from locking their keys in their cars.  I can do without it however.  Lastly, sometimes I feel the car is too light.  When the wind is really gusting, my car is a bit hard to keep in one lane.

Overall, I am looking forward to putting many more miles on my 1998 Honda Civic.  This is the perfect car to buy someone that wants a reliable, fairly-priced and used car. (Including yourself!)
