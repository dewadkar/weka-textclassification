            <b>WHY I BOUGHT AN A10</b>

I recently pooled some birthday and Christmas money together to buy myself a digital camera.  I wanted optical zoom and lots of photo taking options but I didn't want to spend over 500.  I wanted decent quality but since the photos I would be taking would be just for fun I wasn't concerned about having 2 or more mega pixels. I also wanted one that I could purchase additional memory for. I didn't care about having video options or the software that came with the camera.

<b>THE PROS</b>

The A10 met all of my needs and for under $300.  It's a nice camera with Optical and Digital zoom.  You can also buy optional zoom lens to attach.  It has more features than I will probably ever need including a 'stitch' feature to help you take panoramic shots.  You can change the resolution and compression, which can save memory but also affects the quality.

The camera is very easy to use.  I started using it right out of the box before even reading the manual.  It wasn't difficult to install the software and set up the driver to connect the camera to the computer.  The picture quality is great and will be sufficient for most peoples needs.  I have even printed a couple of 5x7's and they turned out nice!

I called the Canon support line with a slight device manager problem.  I got right through and the person I spoke with was very helpful.  The user error (mine) was corrected and he stayed on the phone with me until I successfully  downloaded images from the camera.

My favorite feature is the LCD screen.  Now when I set the camera on timer and run to get in the picture.  I know right away if I need to retake it or not!

<b>THE CONS</b>

I have <I>NEVER</I> seen an electronic device suck the life out of batteries faster than this little camera.  It runs on 4 AAs.  I put in new titanium energizers.  Took about 8 pictures one night and 8 the next day and the batteries were DEAD.  It did say in the manual that cold temperature cold effect the batteries but I thought for sure they'd last longer than that.  I will definitely be investing in rechargeable batteries!

The camera does not come with an AC adapter and requires a 4.3 volt one.  I haven't been able to find that except from Canon at around $50!!!  Since most electronic devices have voltage regulators you would probably be safe using a generic 4.5v AC adapter (10 bucks at Radio Shack) but that would probably void the warranty.

I recommend this camera for anyone who wants more options than what the cheapest Digital cameras offer but doesnï¿½t want to spend a lot.
