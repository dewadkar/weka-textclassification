            Bought it because reasonable price, somewhat sporty performance and appearance. Granted, you won't win a race with a mustang or camaro but I couldn't afford anything faster. It handles pretty good. Small size makes parking and getting in/out of traffic a breeze. I have the 5 speed manual. Provided I am not dogging the engine, highway mileage consistently low to mid 30's. Seats are pretty comfortable; I have driven many times 3+ hours and no back complaints. 

Three minor complaints: one is the gas tank isn't large enough for my liking (holds 12.9 gallons but low fuel light comes on with ~3-4 gallons left). Second is location of oil filter. I change my oil and it is a bear to get to it. Last is back seat is cramped for an adult.

I have 26000 miles and not a single problem; just my dog's hair all over the interior and some bite marks on the vinyl door trim.<br><br>
