            Our 1987 Volvo 740 Wagon (Turbo Intercooled) was purchased January of 1999 because of a blown head gasket in our old Aries k series. We purchased the vehicle used from a dealer and had a great time driving the car for months. We did not aquire any problems until about 7 months later when there was a small problem with the turbo intercooler. I found one of the fuses were loose and that fixed the minor problem. What I absolutely LOVE about volvo's is their safety, flexability, reliability, and most of all, the performance. These cars are made to drive far, fast, and hard. I have taken it up to 110 easily and the purr of the engine was beautiful. I recommend this beautiful piece of machinery to virtually anyone. One set back is it's side which you will get with any wagon. But this is a minor setback to say the least. <br><br>
