            <b>Disclaimer:</b> This is not a good epinion.  My family owns this car, I've gotten to drive it a lot, and I'm simply going to list its qualities for those interested in purchasing one.  These are in descending order from my favorite on down.

<b>1.</b> The Top
The SLK230 has an automatic retractable hardtop.  What that means is you hit a button, the top folds down, you're in a convertible.  You hit it again, the top comes up, you're in a completely secure hard-topped coupe.  This is the craziest thing you've seen a car (without hydraulics) do in your life.  Raise/lower the top in a crowded parking lot and watch the gawkers freeze in their tracks.

<b>2.</b> It's Fast
This car is powered by a 2.3 liter supercharged four-banger.  It puts out 185 hp and 206 lb/ft of torque.  This translates to 6.6 second 0-60 times: quick enough to dispatch that punk kid revving at you in a Mustang 5.0.

<b>3.</b> Women Love It
Before driving this car, I've rarely been whistled at by strangers and hit on in drive through lines.  While I'm not the type to let this inflate my ego, it may be cool for some people.  It even impresses non-skanky girls.  I never heard the phrase &quot;I could have mad sex in this car&quot; in the 626 or even the Mustang.

<b>4.</b> The Sound System
Ours came with an aftermarket 6-CD Changer, but as for the factory speakers, they are incredible.  Turn the volume &amp; bass up, and you'll have people asking you how many subwoofers you have in the trunk.

<b>5.</b> Neighbors Get Really Jealous
We bought our SLK this March.  It was a 98, and just came back off of a 2 year lease.  The car cost like $36,500.  The beauty of it, is most people think it costs more like $60,000 (bah, the uninformed masses).

<b>6.</b> It's Incredibly Easy To Clean
Being such a small car, if you have one of those Car-Dry-Wash (if I violated any trademarks, I'm sorry, and I love your product) spray and wipe type deals, you can clean your SLK in like 8 minutes.

I could keep going forever, I really like the car, but I figure I should list the things I don't like, too.

<b>1.</b> The Headlights
Everything on this car is beautiful aside from the headlights.  They're ugly.  Some CL-Class headlights would look awesome.

<b>2.</b> The Traction Control Light
The Traction Control (ASR) system on this car is wonderful.  The only downside is, for spirited driving, you may want this system off, but the light that comes on when you turn ASR off is so bright you'll be the only person wearing your Oakleys at Midnight.

<b>Conclusion:</b>
If this sounds good to you, just go buy one.  If you can't afford one, BS a dealer into thinking you can afford one and test drive it.  If you're a bad liar, or just can't BS the dealer, steal one (unless it's a bright yellow one in Southwest Ohio... I'd be a little bitter if a fellow epinionator stole my car.)<br><br>
