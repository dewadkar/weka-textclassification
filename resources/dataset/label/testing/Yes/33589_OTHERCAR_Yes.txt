            I've been a fan of the Dodge Spirit (&amp; it's near-twin the Plymouth Acclaim) since they were introduced for the '89 model year.  They have always impressed me as solid, roomy &amp; reliable cars.  We drove a new one back in '89 and came close to buying it, but ended up with a new Caravan instead.

However, I finally had the need (&amp; the $$$!) to buy a second car a few months back and I went looking for a good used Spirit or Acclaim.  I wound up with a '94 Spirit equipped with the 3.0L V6 &amp; 3-speed A670 transaxle.  It also has power door locks, &quot;gold appearance package&quot; and the split-bench front seat.

Best thing about this car is the interior room--it's amazing, considering the outside dimensions of the car and the short 103.5&quot; wheelbase.  The rear seat is much more comfortable than other cars in the Spirit's class such as the Ford Tempo or the Chevy Corsica.  Legroom and headroom are most generous.  Real, honest-to-goodness adults can fit back there and not complain about it!

The 3.0L V6 provides lively performance--you don't need to worry about getting left in the dust from stop light to stop light.  Fuel economy is pretty decent too.  I've yet to see less than 21 MPG average--and this is with all in-town driving!

I wish they still made these things.  They had a great combination of comfort &amp; performance.  They also tend to be durable--a guy that works with me has an '89 Spirit with 180,000 miles on the clock, and it's not exactly a babied car...<br><br>
