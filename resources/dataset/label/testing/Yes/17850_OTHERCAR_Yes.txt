            We LOVE the comfy captain style power seats in front and the awesome Bose 6 speaker am/fm/CD stereo!!!  Car sits you up high like a truck but handles like a car.  Drive cabin is roomy with full power controls and convenient pull down storage compartments in the roof.  There are several cup holders.  All storage trays and compartments whether exposed or closed have removable rubber inserts for cleaning.  Soft somewhat velour cloth seats (dark gray) are wonderful and the Silver Gray metallic paint is very nice.  The decision was rather quick as my car 'died' unexpectedly, we had nothing to put down and necessity dictated a fast and sensible solution.  In hindsight there are 2-1/2 problems:  #1 2-door is a drag, hard to get behind into the back.  4-door is a must on our next SUV.  #2 The rear mounted spare tire is awful.  It creates a large blind spot and destroys the easy 'hatchback' style entry afforded by the models having the spare mounted under the rear.  #2-1/2 Gas mileage is poor 16/20 and we figure 15 is the rule.  I've NEVER had a car that lived up to it's mileage claim.  This isn't a drawback to the vehicle because I would expect the same poor mileage with ANY SUV.  We looked first at the HONDA CRV Compact but although we liked it a lot it was basically a Civic chassis with a small truck body and the seats were VERY uncomfortable.  We shopped aggressively, creatively and got a GREAT deal on the Chevy...lower than we could have on the CRV and there is NO comparison!!!  ***Be certain to enter the back seat on a 2 door, reach into the back to put a package there (it's difficult to pull seat forward as well), and also open the back door on the rear mounted tire model and then do the same thing on an under the chassis mounted hatchback and see the difference!!! The 2-door and the rear tire mount were mistakes.  The decision was quick and we shopped price not personalization.  We are leasing this car for $255 per month (Taxes included!) for 36 months 12,000 miles per year and put down no money! @Global Auto Mall-North Plainfield, NJ...no hassle, quick deal! (read my review in auto lease category).  We paid around $1,200 for title, fees, tax, 1st payment, security, and that's all.  There's plenty of competition from the Explorer (more$$$) and worst mileage reputation, Montero (much more$$$), Pathfinder, Passport, and 4-Runner (more$$$) and Jeep (something about them I don't like, can't say for sure).  We were hurting financially and got the best SUV price on THIS blazer and we love the value and can't imagine hesitating to upgrade in 3 years to another Blazer with the exact feature we want.  ***Footnote-SAVE$$$$$ by reading  my upcoming review under auto leasing and our experiences with Pirates and Thieves!<br><br>
