            I have had this truck for a few weeks now and it is great so far.  I bought it for it looks and supposed car like ride and of course the new 240 hp motor. It is all that I expected so far.  It is quick for a truck and handles wells.  On bumpy roads or potholes it hops like a typical truck but nothing extreme.  Driving is enjoyable and comfortable, I have the LE without leather, the power moonroof is great, stereo sounds incredible for stock system, guages look good. The truck seems solid, no rattles or squeaks yet.  The only downfall which I did not know when I bought it, is that Premium fuel is recommended, and since it does not have great gas mileage and with the prices of gas now that will get expensive.  I have not tracked the mileage yet but it is typical of all the suvs<br><br>
