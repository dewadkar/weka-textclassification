            <b>The CL500 is about the <i>most beautiful and elegant</i> car I have ever seen in my life.</b>  It is absolutely gorgeous. Its long sleek lines make the car look like it�s going 110mph standing still. My dad-in- law�s car is light blue with light cherry hardwood interior and cream leather seats.  The car has everything imaginable.  It has more creature comfort gadgets than ever before put in a car.  I drove this thing around last week and WOW!  Where to begin?

The seats are extremely comfortable and adjust in 14 ways (push button of course.)  It has seat warmers�and wait� <b>seat coolers</b>.  So you can rest easy knowing that your underwear won�t be sticking anymore.  Legroom for a gorilla in the back as well.

The mirrors are all power, heated, and fold in for those tight parking spots.  Speaking of  parking, it has the MB parktronic system that acts like a 360 degree radar.  

It has the GPS system that will locate and direct you to any address, gas station, restaurant, hospital, etc. in the nation.  Complete with automatic SOS to the emergency sources in the event of an accident.

The car has a button you can push to <b>lift the car a few inches</b> in case you decide to go down a dirt road.

The A/C is so advanced it makes my Jeep GC feel ancient.  It has numerous sun sensors so it knows when your side of the car is getting extra sun and you need a little more air.  It allows dual settings and has a back sun shade for increase efficiency and visibility.  

The phone is completely voice activated (if you wish) and can be used from the steering wheel.  A feature that adds safety and saves time.  

The stereo is out of this world.  I don�t know how else to describe it except think about the best sound system you ever heard; this is 10 clicks above it.

<b>The MOTOR is so powerful </b> it will make your head spin.  And <i>smoooooooth</i>!!!  WOW.  This thing will absolutely pin you to your seat while keeping you extremely relaxed.  The smoothness of the transmission is unthinkable.  And the suspension makes you feel as if you are on a freshly paved road all the time.  

<i>Yeah, it�s a lot of money.</i>  In fact, he was offered $25K not to take it.  They are bringing $30K over sticker.  But, if you are into luxury coupes�it doesn�t get any better than this.
