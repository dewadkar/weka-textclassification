            Ok, I'm only the mother of one 13 month old, but I was in the market for a new vehicle and wanted something a little more spacious that I could grow into.  Price was the biggest factor for me since I'm a stay at home mom, so as I started to price minivans I saw that once you added even the most basic of features they were more than I wanted to pay so I had resigned myself to buying a station wagon instead (the Ford Focus looked pretty cute).  While I was doing research on the web I saw that the Sedona was getting pretty good reviews and its price tag was only about $1,000 more than the wagon I was looking at.  But my husband was very skeptic about Kia and at the time there were no crash test results out and no reliability record since its in its first year.  
Well, the timing could not have come any better for the NHTSA crash test results because mere days before I was going to go into the Ford dealership I checked on the Sedona one more time and there it was 5 STARS ALL THE WAY AROUND!  That was it, my husband was warming up to the idea, and the 10 year warranty was aleviating both our concerns regarding long-term reliability.  For just about $1,000 more than we were going to spend we could have a minivan with a far better warranty and crash score.  We took the test drive and were won over.  I've only owned it about a week now but I love it so much I couldn't wait to post my epinion.  It handles great!  I'm 5'4" and have always driven small cars so I was a little apprehensive about driving a big vehicle but it handles superb!  And it is very zippy too, I have to keep my eye on the spedometer.  The ride is smooth, handles bumps well, the engine is quiet, I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say noisy engine.  The seats are comfortable and my son's car seat is firmly secure in the van much better than in my Saturn SL1.  I absolutely love it and can't wait to take a road trip. 
We had a run in with one of the salesman at my local dealership, he was trying to pull some kind of price switch on us so we were pretty upset about that situation but in the end it worked to our benefit because the sales manger made amends with us and brought the price down lower than we were originally going to pay and my husband negotiated 3 years free oil changes.    
My only complaint is that ABS is only an option and finding one with that option on a dealer's lot was close to impossible.  The dealers had Sedonas with things like leather seats, rear spoilers and moonroofs but none with ABS and we even called around to a couple of other dealers.  I wound up getting mine without it which was my only disappointment but it was not a deal breaker and the Sedona was still worth the buy.
