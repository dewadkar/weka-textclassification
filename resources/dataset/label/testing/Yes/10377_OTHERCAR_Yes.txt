            I've had my kia for 4 years now.  I bought the car when it had only 7,000 miles on the odometer.  The first year was the worst for recalls, but the past year has offered very few problems and only maintenance repairs.  
Here is a list of each repair and recall I have had done:
1/99 bought the kia sephia
5/1/99   rotors warped, replaced
6/11/99  Relay short recall (car didn't start at all) junction box replaced
11/30/99 wiper link recall (wipers might fail to work)
11/30/99 glove latch box broke 
11/30/99 new brake pads and rotors
3/00     noticed a tear in the plastic/vinyl seating
6/20/00  fuel pump recall (car wasn't starting well)
7/22/00  a/c leaking, replace leaking lines and recharged coolant
2/27/01  battery replaced
2/27/01  brakes adjusted and cleaned
2/27/01  orv valve recall (gas tank valve would shut off gas pump when filling up with gas)
12/20/02 seat belt recall (seat belt click heard but fails to latch properly)
5/5/03  brake dust build up,  cleaned brake drum

1998 kias had a 3 year 36,000 mile warranty so most of the repairs were covered under warranty.  I have not had a major repair since the warranty expired.  My kia has 42,000 miles on it and is primarily used to drive 10 miles each day.  It doesn't get too much use.
Other issues I have encountered are:
Shifter being stuck in place 
Rust spots on hood where the paint has chipped off
Hub caps color comes off easily and fades quickly.
Car stalls if going uphill and gas is low.

Performance:
The performance of the engine is adequate.  The 98 kia has surprising pep for a 4 cylinder.  The shifting is jerky at best.  Gas mileage is very good.  The brakes have needed several repairs and adjustments.  The brake dust in the design of the kia has no where to go, so it sits in there and builds up.  After the brakes have gotten wet and the car sits overnight you will hear a popping noise each time you begin to move the car.  The brake dust must be cleaned to prevent this from happening. 

My limited number of problems with this car may be related to the low number of miles I have driven it.
