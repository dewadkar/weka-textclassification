            I needed to get a car in August of '99. I wanted to get a new car but was on a limited budget. After doing research online and via sources like CONSUMER REPORTS as well as checking with friends, I decided to get a Honda Civic because Honda had a good reputation for reliability and the Civic was within my price range.

I wanted anti-lock brakes, so I opted for a silver 4-door EX model, in which anti-lock brakes are standard, as well as automatic transmission, AC, radio/CD player (no cassette deck, however), power locks and windows and a sunroof. Also standard are nice-looking, comfortable cloth seats (leather is a pricey option). The only extra I paid for was a "Magic" security system, which disables the starter unless you have a passkey.

I've had this car for almost two years now and LOVE it. It has never given me any trouble at all. I've had oil changes every 3000 miles at about $20 a pop at a nearby Jiffy Lube, and the car is happy as a clam.

It gets good gas mileage (even in the stop-and-go hell of Los Angeles).The seats adjust for height, legroom and back position, so it's very comfortable to drive (I'm 5'11"). It's got nice touches like molded pockets in the inside front doors (useful for maps and CDs) and an armrest between the front seats that hides a decent-sized chamber that I use for parking change and more CDs. Part of the back seat can fold down to extend the trunk room, though it would be a more useful feature, I think, if the WHOLE back seat could fold down like that. Even so, there's a lot of trunk room in the car, more than I've needed so far. I'm not a sound connoisseur, but for me the sound system is more than adequate. I don't have any complaints about the AC or heat, either.

I really like the look of the car, and it feels solid. It's got anti-lock brakes, as I've mentioned, as well as airbags in the driver's and front passenger's seats. I haven't had an accident in it, thank goodness, but I feel like the car could protect me if I did. That's a nice feeling in LA--I think Boston's a much scarier city to drive in, but LA offers its share of dangers.

The silver color is really cool. I don't have a garage, so the car gets really dusty and dirty but remains presentable enough that I sometimes go a few weeks between washings. 

My only complaint about this car is that it doesn't have a lot of power. Once you hit a target speed, it maintains fine--but getting there feels like a struggle. It's also not a big fan of hills. It can handle them, but it's not happy about it. I believe these are chronic Honda weaknesses; if you're a speed demon or have a lot of hills in your daily driving, you probably should look into a VW. However, for an average driver like me, it's merely an annoyance, not a fatal flaw or even enough to make me wonder if I bought the right car. I bought the right car!

I'm very, very happy with my Civic EX. I plan to keep this car for the long term, and if it continues to perform as well as it has so far, when the time comes to replace it, I'll buy another Honda.
