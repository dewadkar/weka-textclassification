            I traded in my beat up, over-serviced mini-truck for a mini-SUV.  When looking for a car, I had a few criteria.  I wanted something more safe than my previous vehicles, so I included airbags in my shoppinf list.  Because I tend to drive in the mountains in winter, I needed four wheel drive.  Plus, I wanted something fun to drive.

The Suzuki Vitara answered all of these demands.  The two door version I got has automatic transmission, and a soft top.  The soft top is split in two halves (unlike the old Geo minis) and the back can be removed easily, while the front can be flipped back and replaced with minimal effort.  The four wheel drive is shift on the fly even at higher speeds.

The greatest surprise about the car is the turning radius.  I can pretty much turn completely around within an average street without having to use reverse.  I can pull into tiny parking spots with no problem, and can whip around tight turns easily.  I've noticed none of the roll-over problems that these mini-SUVs are reportedly plagued with.

Another great feature is the cargo room.  Everyone who I say this to thinks I'm crazy, but I'm telling you, there's a lot more room back there than it looks.  And since the back seats fold down (separately or together), I've been able to fit rather large things in there (like my new 27 inch TV in its box) with ease.  I always tell people that there is nothing that I haven't been able to fit into the back, and I used to use my truck for that.

I've had the car for about a year now and a few things nag me.  Firstly, the plastic &quot;hooks&quot; that hold the top on are not that sturdy.  The one that came with the car had obviously been removed previously because it was torn when I got it.  They're very expensive to replace; luckily the dealer graciously took it back with no questions.

The car also did not come with some features which I should have requested when I bought it.  Air conditioning, for one.  I suppose that's my own stupid fault, but who doesn't need air conditioning that they'd make you pay extra for it?  The dealer should also make the optional hard top a standard replacement for the soft top.

In its first year in production, there was bound to be some need for a recall.  It's a shame it was the brake lights.  Hopefully all new Vitaras have this item fixed so you won't find yourself leading a pack on the turnpike doing 80 toward traffic with no brake lights.

Finally, and most disheartening, I've had it for a year and already it's making strange noises under the hood when I brake.  That sort of thing shouldn't happen with a new car for at least until the warranty runs out.  Looks like I'll be heading back to the dealer soon.  Deja Vu.
