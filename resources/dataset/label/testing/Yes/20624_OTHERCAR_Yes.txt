               To be honest, I'm really not buying any car.  However, I can say that I have driven the Audi A4 for almost six months now, and I think it's absolutely the best car out there.  Audis aren't especially pricey -- at least not the one that I drive -- as I got mine for about $9,000 used.  I also love the handling.  The car seems to respond to your every move, and you feel in complete control.  Also, for those performance freaks out there, it's a German car.  It was designed for the Autobahn, so it'll give you some quality speed if you need it.  Also, the luxury is quite obvious.  A power sunroof and heated seats are just two of the wonderful aspects that this car possesses.

   I love this car so much, I haven't even found anything wrong with it.  I enjoy driving the car too much to look at the negative aspects.  I also believe that this car suits everybody's needs, from college students to families.  This is a quality car for everybody.<br><br>
