            Well, here we go again.  The lease was up on our dark red 1999 SL1, which replaced the silver plum 1998 SL1, which got totaled in two successive accidents in two successive weekends.  The silver plum choice was not my best hour--it was that or a bilious green.  The dark red was better.  Both cars were identical in features, appointments, etc.  A small exterior design difference was all there was.

I'm getting to be an old fart who likes his comfort.  The SL1s were fine except that every time I got into them I hit my right upper thigh against the bottom of the steering wheel.  That was the only drawback. 

However, I and The Bride took ourselves down to Saturn of Quincy, MA and saw our own personal salesperson, Mrs. Judi Cabral, who put us into the previous two cars.  Remember now, THERE IS NO BARGAINING WITH A SATURN DEALER.  THE PRICE YOU PAY IS THE PRICE EVERYONE PAYS.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU'RE TOLD TO HIT THE BRICKS--VERY POLITELY, BUT YOU'RE TOLD.

Judi had a special package that she was saving for us.  It was an L-100 with a bunch of extras that didn't cost extra.  Don't ask me why they did this--I really don't care.  They did it and I loved it.  It included a spoiler (which I'll certainly need at 55mph), aluminum alloy wheels, in-dash CD player, power doors, windows, door locks and an eight-speaker stereo system that will blow the boys in the 'hood right out of their minds.

Ours was exactly the color we wanted:  deep bergundy with medium gray upholstery.  The steering wheel tilts up out of the way so you don't hit your upper thigh on it.  It has automatic headlights which The Bride thought was just great.  Me, too.  You never touch the headlight switch.  It's controlled by a light-sensitive sensor on the dashboard.  When the light falls below a certain level for a certain length of time, the headlights go on.  When you turn off the ignition, they go out.  Neat.

It has not only the requisite front air bags, but side ones, as well. They are located up over the center post between the doors.  The doors automatically lock as soon as you put the car in gear.  If you need to let someone out without turning off the engine, just stop and push the button conveniently located on the door next to your elbow.  ABS brakes were a novelty to me and I love them.  They work exactly as advertised.

The controls for the power windows are located on the console, around the shift lever, positioned as the doors they control.  The driver's control has an Auto feature, as well as an incremental one.  The other controls are so self-evident and easy to read that they really didn't need to write about them in the owner's manual, which is very extensive and easy to read.

So we got into it and drove it.  I behind the wheel, Judi in the front seat and The Bride in back.  It was so quiet when it cranked over that I couldn't believe it was running.  It took off very smoothly with more power than I was used to, since the SL1 was not as powerful.  We went up onto the Expressway (freeway for those of you from the Left Coast) and blended into traffic so easily that I couldn't believe the power of this four-cylinder engine.  

Visibility was marvelous.  The side mirrors all but did away with blind spots.  The windshield and rear window were high and broad enough so you could see everywhere with ease. The radio antenna was on the rear so it didn't get into your line of vision.

Seats are so comfortable and adjustable that you'll have no trouble finding your own personal positions.  Headrests are adjustable to accommodate your own height.  Also adjustable are the points on the door pillars where the seat belts are anchored.  This way you can adjust them so they don't cut into your neck.

The seats go back far enough to accommodate Michael Jordan and they don't cramp the people in back.  In the SL-1 I had the seat all the way back and I'm only 5'8".  This is not necessary now.

All the controls are placed for easy access by the driver.  A very nice, thoughtful piece of engineering.  There's a power outlet in the back seat, too.  It used to be called a cigarette lighter but now it has no lighter and comes with a cap over it.  Since fewer and fewer people smoke nowadays, they've put that little piece of equipment to better use.  Same thing in the front.  If you want to plug in your laptop or your cell phone, it's right there.

The suspension system is so well designed that it minimizes most of the lumps and bumps you encounter.  Each day I cross the bridge known as The Forest Hills Overpass that runs between Mattapan and Jamaica Plain.  It has (and I've counted every single one as I thumped over them) 21 seams connecting the parts of the bridge.  Now it's like they weren't even there.  

If I need quick response, either from the engine or from the steering, it's there to the point where I don't even have to think about it anymore.  The car seems to read my mind and react automatically and immediately to any situation I may encounter.

In short, the car is attractive, comfortable, economical, extremely responsive and a delight to drive.  Even The Bride, who only wants cars so small you put them on instead of getting into them said she loved this one from the first time she drove it.

During the demo ride on the expressway I asked her if she wanted to try it.  "Nope!", she yipped.  "But you might want to..."  "Nope!"

We got off onto the streets and I asked her again.  "Nope!"  "Honey, you'll like it so much."  "Nope!  When it's time, I'll drive it.  Now leave me alone."  I left her alone.

When we took delivery I again asked, "Would you like to be the first and drive it home?"  "I said, 'no' and I meant 'no'.  You drive."

Later that afternoon she walked up to the door with her keys in her hand and said in a very nonchalant voice, "Well, I think I'll go to Walmart for a bit."  And she left.

I know what she did:  she first drove around the neighborhood for a bit, then went out onto one of the larger streets, then went to Walmart.  She came back and couldn't praise the car enough.  I'm so glad. 

My close friend picked up an L-300 the same day.  Same shell, same interior, but his has a V-6 engine, a moon/sun roof (he's explained the difference but it makes no sense to me) and a 6-CD player (mine holds only one at a time.  Well, how many can you listen to at once?)  He's as in love with his as I am with mine.  I'm already making plans for the next one.
