                I have loved Jettas since I was in high school and decided to purchase one after I graduated from college.  So I did.  I found a gorgeous silver 1998 GT.  I feel in love.  I had it for 5 lovely days, put about 300 miles on it and WHAM it was gone before I knew it.  

    I was driving down Commonwealth Avenue in Boston when some moron completely blew a red light and nailed me going about 35mph.  I had been T-Boned as the police officers called it.  

    I was fine besides a few abrasions from the seatbelt and of course back and neck pain a couple days later.  The car held up like a fort.  It was unfortunately totaled due to the amount of damage done to the frame, but after I got over the fact that my new Jetta was gone, I was thankful to be alive.  

    I have driven Hyundai's for the past six years and am pretty sure that I would have been seriously injured had I been in that car.  Thank God I wasn't those cars are like tin-foil.  So two weeks after I got my settlement check I went and bought a 1999 1/2 Black GLS.  I love it.  It is sturdy and a nice ride.  I couldn't be happier, although I wish I had my silver 98' GT back.  I loved it.  :(<br><br>
