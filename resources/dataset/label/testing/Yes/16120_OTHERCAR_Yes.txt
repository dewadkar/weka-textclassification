            My fiancee' and I have two small children(18 months and 4 yrs) we reside in Michigan and are familiar with harsh adverse weather conditions. With this in mind we set off on an SUV hunt first choice Ford Explorer (very bad choice) second was JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE, I wish it was my first choice I could have saved time and disappointment. You cannot find a better riding/handling SUV in this price range ($26,000 to $36,000). Chrysler has outdone themselves on the R&amp;D dept. with this vehicle. The choice for us was country suspension ( Raises vehicle aprox.2&quot;) V-8 with tow package. Our Dealer (Five star Pat Abiney Plymouth Chrysler) has bent over backwards with followup calls on our purchase and if there was anything that they could do for us!! after owning this vehicle my choice again in two years when I trade my car (Buick Park Ave. Ultra) it will also be for a chrysler product.And last but not least in the words of my Fiancee' &quot;THE MORE I DRIVE THE JEEP, THE MORE I FALL IN LOVE WITH IT&quot;.
My daughter also loves it due to the fact she can see all around while sitting in her carseat. Our plans for next year now include trail riding out west, I can hardly wait to put it to the test.<br><br>
