               As a high school graduate, I was eager to hit the road in my very own car.  My parents were adamant, however, that my first car be a Volvo.  They trusted the company due to its high safety standards.  At first I protested, thinking that a Volvo was a family car and not in keeping with my youthful lifestyle, but I was mistaken.  I have owned my S70 for three years now and love it.  I purchased a base model sedan in red (I figured I could at least LOOK youthful in a red car). I have had no problems with this car whatsoever.  I have driven it in all kinds of conditions in New England - rain storms, icy roads, thick snow, and baking heat and the S70 has performed magnificently.
   The interior of the S70 is spacious and comfortable. There is lots of leg and headroom (I'm 6'2&quot; and fit fine) in both the back and front seats.  The trunk is cavernous and there's plenty of room for all of my stuff when I travel to and from college in the fall and spring.  The instruments and buttons on the dashboard are well laid out and intuitively placed, an extra saftey feature which allows you to keep your eyes on the road.
    The Volvo also performs well.  The handling is excellent and the steering responsive.  Even in the most adverse conditions, I have never felt like I have lost control of the vehicle. My biggest complaint with the car however, is that the base model engine doesn't provide quite enough umph to accelerate such a heavy car (that steel saftey cage really adds some weight).  I would recommend the turbo model to those considering purchasing this car.
   Overall, this has been a great car and any snide comments I've received from my &quot;cool&quot; peers have quickly been silenced as soon as I take them for a ride.  It's safe, quiet, a smooth ride, roomy, and joy to drive.
