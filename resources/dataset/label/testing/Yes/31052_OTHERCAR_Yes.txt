            	Since the Northeast's winters aren't very friendly, I wanted a vehicle that would be reliable and able to handle efficiently in snowy weather.  So, after a little shopping around, I made the brilliant decision of buying a 1991 Suzuki Sidekick.  It is now the year 2000, I have 109,000 miles on it and it is still running like a charm.  
	One of the best things about this SUV is that I can manuever it into those tight spots in the city, whereas the bigger SUV's (virtually all of them) can't.  Also, I get very good gas mileage on the open highway and in the city.  On the other hand, some bigger SUV's probably hog a lot more gas.  
	The Suzuki Sidekick is a very smooth riding vehicle despite the fact that it is already approaching its 10 year mark.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is considering making a SUV purchase.  You won't be disappointed, as this vehicle is the ultimate four-wheel drive to own.
