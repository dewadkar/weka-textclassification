            I purchased a 2001 Ford Escape XLT, loaded it up the wazoo... had ALL the options!  Only thing I didn't opt for was the "No Boundaries Rack System," which would've delayed the construction of the car another month or two.  By in all, I am very satisfy with it thusfar... with one exception... when driving, the car pulled to the left and had to be brought in for an alignment (of course covered by warranty, but then why is a new car out of alignment???)

PROS:

Engine is punchy and adequate for cutting lanes without breaking a sweat.  The V-6 is a must, the four cylinder is a dud.  Interior space is amazing for a compact SUV!  Front and rear seats are comfortable even for a 6 ft+.  6-way driver power seats (avail. in leather package) are great b/c it has height adjustment which is critical for drivers of different heights.  Tailgate opens upward (I find the sideway ones annoying) and even the glass opens separately if desired.  Plenty of cubby holes to store junk, there's even a stow-away tray under the front passenger's seat (avail in leather package.)  I opted for the 7 speaker 6-CD changer audio system.  For a stock audio system, it's excellent!  It rides well, kinda feels like something between a car and a mid-size SUV.  Brakes are amazing!.... stops much better than all other SUVs!  It's also perfect length for parking in the city.  Here in NYC spaces are hard to come by, and this truck has not problems fitting spaces.  It is only 173" long, even shorter than a CRV! (but looks and feels alot bigger.)  I've been averaging 17 MPG in the city, just ok for a V-6, but excellent for and an SUV.  Trailer hitch is great, can tow up to 3500lbs.  For those cyclists, I believe you can buy a bike rack that attaches to the trailer hitch and viola!


CONS:

Steering column shifter blocks the rear defrost & hazzard buttons!  Hope they change the shifter in future models b/c it's very annoying!  I still have trouble finding the ignition key hole, it's in an awkward place!  Supposedly it's not a true 4X4 b/c it doesn't have a low gear transfer case, it only has a high gear transfer case.  It's better than the AWD systems in the CRV's b/c there is a 50/50 (front/rear) torque distribution when you turn on the 4x4 switch.  I haven't had the opportunity to test out the 4WD, but I'm sure it's adequate for the snow and mild offroading in dirt and mud.  Just can't climb rocks or mountains with it; now is that so bad?  Road noise is noticeable on certain pavements, but then again, I'm not driving a Mercedes.  Wind noise is also noticeable at higher speeds, but it's really not that bad... just turn up the radio.


FINAL WORDS:

The Escape has to prove it's reliability.  It's been plagued with a few recalls in the first few batches of production vehicles.  Supposedly, Ford got it's act together and immediately attended to all the problems.
