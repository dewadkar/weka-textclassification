            I LOVE the Mustang.  It's sporty and a real eye-catcher.  I own a 1999 convertible (the basic car-not GT-with lots of upgrades).  I chose this vehicle because of the options and how great it looks on the road.  It also has a great history.  One of the best parts of buying it was getting a package a few weeks later with a commemorative key chain, cd case, 3 classic cds, and a Mustang collector's book.  I might have gotten this because it was the 35th anniversary in 1999, but it proves to me that Ford is genuinely concerned about doing the extra &quot;little things&quot; to make their cars, and their company, very customer-oriented.  I've had the opportunity to fill out feedback surveys about what I like and don't like about the car.    
The car handles great, and the pick-up and speed are great.  I have a 5-speed, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  You can get a real feel for the car and for the road, and you are in total control.  The gas mileage is pretty good for a sports car, and for all you get, the price is definitely worth giving it a second look.  I like also how the convertible top is automatic, and the back window is glass, not plastic, so it will last longer.   
Cruise down the road playing the Ford classic cd's from the 60's, 70's, and 80's...can't beat that.
Things I wish I had checked out:  There are three drawbacks for the car...First are the drink holders.  The holders are not very deep, so when you turn even a small corner, the drink spills.  It's also right next to the stick and you can't shift with the drink there.  They should have reversed the drink holder with the button to pull the top back.  My solution:  clean out the compartment between the seats and put the drinks in there.  Second, the trunk space.  There's not much of it.  It's big enough to put a golf bag, side-to-side, but the depth isn't much, either.  It's hard to put anything more than a few duffel bags back there.  And third, while this seems kinda stupid, the glove box is difficult to close, even with the small blue car manual they give you.  I find it slightly annoying that I can't close the box with a manual they give you, inside.
This car is definitely worth it.  You get style, quality, and a great price all rolled into one.<br><br>
