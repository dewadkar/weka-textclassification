            It really is a shame that GM has decided to dissolve Oldsmobile, because they were one of the few divisions producing quality cars. Too bad most young professionals were scared off by the name "Oldsmobile" in spite of all the ads promising that this car was not their father's. 

My Intrigue is a fantastic car, with a torque-y engine that provides some muscle from a standstill and the ponies (205hp) to allow you to pass easily at highway speeds - and beyond.

The subdued styling hide the fact that this is the same car as Pontiac's Grand Prix, just with new skin. The low coefficient of drag also make for a small target for RADAR, and chances are Mr. Fuzz will often assume that your Oldsmobile is traveling more conservatively than it really is anyway.

I like the ignition key switch being mounted flat on the dash face, instead of on the steering wheel column, as in most other GMs. Just another piece to make it a unique vehicle. The steering wheel-mounted radio control and cruise control buttons are intuitively placed, and help to keep your eyes on the road while you surf the radio dial and/or change your cruising speed.

Likewise, the automatic temperature control unit allows you to pick the temp that you want and forget about it. The HVAC will adjust itself as needed to keep the temperature - just like home. "Set it and forget it" isn't just for Ron Popeil.

Although Oldsmobile is not going to exist in a few years, they are still producing more Intrigues in the interim. Buy one if you plan to drive for several years. If not, buy a used one and enjoy a well built, sporty sedan at the slightly lower cost that a dying nameplate brings to the used car market.
