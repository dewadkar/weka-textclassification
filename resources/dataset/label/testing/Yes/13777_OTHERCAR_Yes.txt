                 I bought my 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 in May of 1999.  At the time, I was leary about going from a sports vehicle to &quot;big&quot; truck, but it was a piece of cake.  I opted for the quad cab, and with the 4 doors and back seat, it is just like driving a car.  It handles very well in all conditions.  Not to mention how many stares I get being a tiny woman driving a big truck. 

I feel very safe for me and my passengers, as it comes with dual air-bags with the option to turn the passenger bag off. 

 Gas mileage is not that great. I get about 14 miles to the gallon, but I have taken it on a long trip and it went up to 17 miles to the gallon.  I have also pulled a ski boat behind it, and you couldn't even tell it was back there. I didn't lose gas mileage while pulling either. 

 As of right now, I have had my Dodge Ram for 8 months, and have never had any problems with it, and it has never had to go to the shop.  I love it, and definately recommend it to anyone!!<br><br>
