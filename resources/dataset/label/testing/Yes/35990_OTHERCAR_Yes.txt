I bought my 92 Subaru SVX a year ago at an auction and have never been disappointed with this beautiful car, except when I needed to get new tires, because the prices for those tires were nearly the price of a new Geo Metro. To be honest � I love this car. This is the 5th car that I have owned and the Subaru SVX is the car for people who don�t like a cheap ride. It has split windows, which give this car its unusual style. Some people don�t like them, but I receive a lot of compliments from other people. It has a 3.3l, H-6cyl engine and pumps about 230-240hp. The top speed that I tried, was 140mp, and I have to say that it is a dead quiet ride; it doesn't even make the noise that Acura TL makes at 100 mph.

I recommend this slick car for everybody. Too bad that Subaru doesn't make them any more. It would be the best sports car of the millennium.
You�re never going to believe me until you try it yourself� Try and you won't regret it� <br><br>
