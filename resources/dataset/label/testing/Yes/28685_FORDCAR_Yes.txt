            We purchased our first Ford Van in 1986, traded up to a Ford 250 Van in 1987 to pull an RV. It worked fine, we still have the &quot;87&quot;.  It is our workhorse utility vehicle.  It just keep running. Recently purchased a 2000 150 Chateau for main vehicle.  We are in our seventies and we thought that the misses would have trouble handling the van, traded in an Expedition on the new van.  She is very comfortable and secure driving the new van. I would hesitate to say we love the vehicle, but we do have strong emotional ties to it.  We refer to the van as our covered pickup truck. Who buy this type of vehicle?  Need and utility should be the reason one purchases a vehicle and this van is the one for us.<br><br>
