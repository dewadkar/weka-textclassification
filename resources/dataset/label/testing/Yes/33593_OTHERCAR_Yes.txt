            I have had my 1999 C280 Sport for over a year now and I have few regrets.  This is my 14th car and is by far my favorite.  This year, they have redesigned the C-class and in my humble opinion, my car looks much better!  I have the black on black mode, have upgraded the rims to 17&quot; sport rims and have tinted the windows.  Here are a few observations about my car:

Pros:

* The fit and finish are what you would expect from Mercedes.  There has been a couple of rattles with the carbon-fiber dash in the past, but all have been fixed by the dealer.

* Again, the styling of the car is very nice.  Not gaudy enough to look like a pimp, but nice enough to get my car parked up front when valeted.

* The car handles very well.  At high speeds, it is as solid as a rock.  Around town, the suspension is not to rough.

* Especially at freeway speeds, the car accelerates very nicely.  And, unlike the C230 Kompressor, it is very smooth. (I could definitely tell the C230 was a 4 cylinder.)

CONS:

*  Acceleration from a dead stop is delayed at times (from about 0-20)

*  The CD changer costs about $1000!!!! and cannot be bought elsewhere!

*  I HATE THE SPEED SENSITIVE STEREO.  With the windows up, the car is so quite, the stereo doesn't need to be compensated. The only way this feature would be useful is if I drove with the windows down. Wish I could turn this feature off!

* I have had a few nickel and dime problems; ie. Window regulator fixed twice and gas gauge shows empty when full sometimes (this is a common problem esp. with CA gasoline).  These problems though were fixed by the dealer A.S.A.P.

Overall, it is a great car and would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
