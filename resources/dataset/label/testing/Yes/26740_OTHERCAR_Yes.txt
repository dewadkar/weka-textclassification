            This camera hits the spot!! I read all the reviews prior to purchasing, I would say it's even better than what I read. I have found that using the HQ setting is good for most useses. If you know that will need to make a photo of a particular shot, move to the SHQ mode (lowest SHQ). I have a Mac and I was able ro do some really neat stuff by pluging the camera directing into the RCA Jack in the rear. I made a short movie and and was able to download pictures at lighting fast speeds (137k files) but they are not very clear. I got a FlashPath which is bit buggy on Macs so you will want to go to Smartdisk.com and update to the latest Rev. The only thing that I am not happy with is that the thumb nail pictures are so compressed (viewing on the computer only) that they look really blurry.<br><br>
