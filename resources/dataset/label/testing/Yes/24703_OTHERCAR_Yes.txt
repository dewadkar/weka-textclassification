            I Purchased my 1999' Grand Cherokee Laredo 2 Wheel Drive, in March of 1999.
Overall it has been a great SUV, I currently have 24,000 miles on the Grand Cherokee, and only had it in service for a rough idling problem, that should have been corrected normally pretty easily, but due to poor mechanics at the Jeep dealership where I had purchased it. The problem was with a water / moister leaking onto a electrical contact underneath the engine, which damaged a engine regulating sensor. It took over 3 visits to get this repair resolved at the Jeep Dealer. The Grand Cherokee 4.0 liter V6 engine is a great durable engine, but next time I will purchase the V8 version for a little more horse power, and I probably will purchase the 4X4 option as well. The &quot;Laredo Version&quot; is a much better bargain than the &quot;Limited&quot; version the over priced cost of a few added touches is not worth the added $5,000.00 to $10,000.00. You get the bulk of the &quot;Goodies&quot;
with the &quot;Laredo&quot; version without going broke, making the payments.
Even though this is a 2 wheel drive version it is great in the Indiana winters, and handles very well overall in all weather conditions.I usually purchase GM products, but the SUV's that they offered at the time looked and performed like a older 5 to 10 year design of the past. After
all the Jeep has worked to keep a very good reputation for great workmanship and performance over the past 60 years, in peace time as well as war time reliability.<br><br>
