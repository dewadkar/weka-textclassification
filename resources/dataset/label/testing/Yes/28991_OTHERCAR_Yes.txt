            This review is on my Electric Blue EX 4WD model 2000 CRV. I bought this vehicle new and it now has approx 60,000 miles so I will focus more on how the vehicle has done over the last 60,000 miles rather than reviewing it as a new vehicle. The additions made to this vehicle were a K&N Air Filter, Window Tint, Honda Pinstripe, Nose Bra, Sun Roof, Mud Guards, Door Mounted Tweeter Speakers and Full Leather.

A little about the Leather and Sunroof upgrades, which were done aftermarket, but through our dealer when the vehicle was purchased. These additions made a world of difference as far as the look and feel of the vehicle. The CRV went from bland, how I felt when I first test-drove a CRV, to very nice both inside and out. If you have a good dealer then I would recommend letting them use their own sources rather than getting the leather factory installed. Honda leather is normally &#147trimmed&#148, while ours is &#147full&#148 leather. The overall cost was actually better than Honda&#146s and the look is incredible.

The exterior is still in great shape. The paint and all the surface attachments look extremely good. We have used Liqui Tech products on the exterior of the vehicle from the beginning with no issues. The Mud Guards have really helped the sides stay nice. The black molded portions on the sides of the exterior will discolor slightly after washing and waxing, but can easily be &#147restored&#148 with a good armor all type product. I have even mixed a tiny bit of WD-40 into the mix and it seems to really help.

Overall the interior has held up very well also. There have been no problems with anything breaking or excessive wear anywhere in the vehicle. That includes that Leather and Sunroof.

Mechanically the vehicle has been solid. I cannot really report any serious mechanical failures or issues. The engine and transmission still run smooth at a city/hwy average of 25mpg. Oil burning is still as new. I have never had to add a quart of oil between changes.

Overall the 2000 CRV has been a stellar performer for its 60,000 miles. The engine performance is not up to the same specs as the current generation, but by no means is it a dog. I have never felt unsafe in this vehicle zipping around town or on the Interstate. The 4WD feature adds a nice bit of stability on ice, snow or wet roads when it has to activate. Overall the CRV has been a joy to drive. Over the years people have continually commented on how much room there is inside. One interesting note is that the driver seat actually sits a little higher than the passenger seat. The Rear Hatch design, which some people wondered about and is now different on current models, has never been an issue. I never knew then what the problem was with the design and I don&#146t know after 60,000 miles.
 
Nothing really unique to look out for on these when they are used other than your normal checks when dealing with used cars. There is plenty of Aftermarket stuff for these models. Just do a search on the Internet for Honda CRV as there is an active owner group out there.

A word or two about maintenance to give you an idea of how this vehicle was kept up. I wash and clean the vehicle regularly and wax once a year. Once or twice a year the leather gets a treatment. I pretty much do all Honda recommended maintenance intervals except oil, which I do every 7500 miles instead of the 3750 miles.

Let me make this last comment about picking a vehicle like the Honda CRV, new or used. Please compare Apples to Apples and be honest with yourself. Don&#146t go look at a $35,000 Durango or Tahoe with a powerful gas guzzling V8 and compare it to a $21,000 CRV or Tracker with a fuel-efficient 4-cylinder and then complain the 4-cylinder is underpowered.
