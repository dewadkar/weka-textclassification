            Outstanding alternative to either low mpg gas vehicles or sluggish, overly complex, hybrids.  Solid German engineering that has taken diesel technology to a new level of performance.  Bought my first one a year ago and have loved every mile of driving.  Rated at 50mpg with a manual and 45 with an automatic.  My first road trip was a 400 mile run with the cruise set at 78mph and the A/C pumping full.  I got 42 MPG on that run with the automatic! and still had over a quarter of a tank left to go.  I am averaging around 3 CENTS per mile to run this car.

A real charmer.  Sounds like it is going to be noisy on the inside, but sound insulation is excellent.  At highway cruising, the engine has so much torque that it lopes along, using less RPM than a gas engine, so less noise.

With the automatic, I can cruise at 65 and it NEVER downshifts to climb a hill.  Its a mountain-goat.

Not all dealers have competent service so do some investigating through www.tdiclub.com  They are an excellent source for information.

It requires a 'mind shift' to own.  You don't have to sweat finding fuel and you'll be looking for rest areas, not fuel pumps when on the highway since it gets over 600 miles on a 14 gallon tank.  To get the absolute most out of your car and ensure a service life of over 300,000 miles, you should be using premium diesel oils, but these are now synthetic and have a 10,000 mile service interval.
