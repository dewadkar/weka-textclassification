            First of all let me say that I wasn't sure about the morality of a person who sells a brand of vehicle writing a review on that brand. But then I considered this little tidbit of information. I also sell other vehicles and I am not writing a review of those so maybe that will alleviate some of the possible distrust that someone reading this might have.
I recently changed jobs and became a member of the sales force at Royal on the Eastside in Bloomington, In. I have been there for about 2 months now and in that time period I have sold more Subaru than any other brand.
I have found that my Subaru customers are well informed, highly educated, and completely knowledgeable in this product. They know all about the dependability and safety of the Subaru line of vehicles. Subaru carries All Wheel Drive on all of its vehicles including their version of a sports car.
That's right I said sports car. Because I firmly believe that the Impreza RS Sedan 2.5 is a sports car. It has the look, the feel, and the power even though it is only a 4 cylinder engined car. You must remember, however, that the Subaru have a different style of engine than most other cars. The horizontally opposed engine give them a lower center of gravity and also weighs less than most other engines. This allows for the greater handling and speed due to the lighter weight. 
The suspension is also designed extremely well with maintaining the line through a curve of great importance. The Impreza also has very little body lean or roll due to the suspension and the low center of gravity.
Have you seen the Impreza RS? The look is very sporty. It has a spoiler on the back, breather coming through the hood, and the car just simply looks powerful!
Ok, I know this all sounds like a sales pitch but consider this, I can make more money selling the higher priced cars and yet I am reviewing Subaru. But don't take my word for it, ask someone who owns one. I have sold them to a college student, a teacher, and I have an appointment this week to deliver 1 to a couple of college professors. Seems to me that these folks know what's worth their time and money.<br><br>
