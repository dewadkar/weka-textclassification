            I have read some of the complaints people have about the voyager....I have always had a small car and it was always a pain in the butt..I have owned a vw, pontiac, ford, mazda and many more....and the plymouth I now own has been by far the most reliable vehicle I have purchased...It has only had some minor stuff here and there...and nothing so far wrong w/the transmission..(crossing my fingers)..I have, however, experienced problems w/the overdrive transmissions that chrysler makes..I have learned some tricks to my specific van...like for instance...if the cruise control seems to not stick on all the time..--when wanted to stay on--check the air filter...if the engine is not getting enough air the cruise control doesn't work properly..and if you are trying to change plugs..it is easier to put the van on some high ramps...and change them that way..
I have used my van to haul things w/..and it has been great..I have the capabilities of either attaching a trailer on the back or attaching things onto the luggage rack I have on top...I used it to go from western PA to Chicago, IL and back....and had a very enjoyable trip..
There is only a couple things I would like to complain about..first off, do the mechanics and the auto makers have an agreement to make it as hard as possible for "the common joe" to work on their own van??? for example the maintenance required light..is only a dummy light for you to check things and do routine maintenance..but you cannot shut this off by yourself..only a mechanic has the special tool..and how they have the engine under the hood..it makes it very difficult to change for example ..plugs..and to fix my dome light is probably going to take me a wiring schematic to figure it out...oh well..
