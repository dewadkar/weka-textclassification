                      My husband and I have bought a Dodge Ram.  Are Ram is supplied with all the additives like Magnum power, 4X4 guts, Quad cab, and even four doors.  This is the first four door pickup we have ever had.  I ask the sale person why four doors?  He said &quot;For wide open, easy access to the roomy, even more ergonomic interior, and the big comfortable back seat.  For easier loading and unloading of tools, cargo, people or whatever else you might want to take along for the ride.  And just because we think it's a darn good idea&quot;.  It rides great on road and off road.   <br><br>
