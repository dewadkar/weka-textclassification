                What is the most important thing you look for when buying a vehicle? Looks? Safety? Dependability? Price? I have found all of this in one car. Before, I had to choose between what I wanted or needed. When I went car shopping this time, I had a list of requirements that I gave to the salesman. &quot;I can't afford much, I don't want a mini van, I have 4 kids, so I have to have enough room for them and groceries for 6 people , I hate to pay Insurance companies too much, I work from my car, but most of all, I want something that looks great!&quot;
    The Plymouth Breeze had all of that, in a car that doesn't come close to looking like the school bus that is usually required to haul that many kids. I have finally found the middle ground between what I wanted and what I needed. It handles great in the winter with it's front wheel drive, and it's roomy enough for the kids, groceries and my office on the road. It looks very professional when I am on business, and sporty when I'm at the ball diamonds. It doesn't break me up on gas or insurance, and my 16 year old is always wanting to borrow it because her friends think its cool. By the way, that's the only thing I hate about it! 
    For the first time I have found a car that fits my life so completely, that I am bothered by the fact that it won't last forever.
Happy Motoring!
