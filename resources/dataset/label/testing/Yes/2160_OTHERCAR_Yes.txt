            I absollutly loved my 1994 Rodeo.  We bought it brand new off the lot as a left over after shopping around for every other SUV. We drove everything, Chevy Blazer, Jeep Cherokee, Ford Explorer....  And Dollar for Dollar the Isuzu was the least expensive and the Roomiest of them all. I am 6' tall and I can adjust my drivers chair to exactly where I want it, then jump in behind myself in the back seat and sit comfortably without my legs being jammed up against the seat. It also came with lots of Cargo room. So if you have a family, or are planning to have one in the future, I would say buy one of these babies!!! 
The stock V-6 with automatic transmission was a bit underpowered but It still managed to pull my Chrysler Sebring Coupe from Maine to California no problem. The only thing I would have liked to see on the model was a shift on the fly 4-wheel drive. So for that being the only think I DIDN'T like about it... I would say that I LOVED it!!!  I would definatly buy another one and may yet in the near future.<br><br>
