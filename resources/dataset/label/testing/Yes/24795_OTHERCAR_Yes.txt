            I have one word to say. AMAZING! This car feels agile and sporty, just like every other BMW, while having the interior space of a yacht. 
First, lets talk about the exterior. Most people are split on this. I for one love it. To me, it looks aggressive and understated at the same time. When you look back at it through your rear view mirror, it looks wide, aggressive and menacing, while not going all out like some other cars. I like the clear blinker lenses and jewel rear tail lights, makes it look much more modern. 
Next, the interior. I find that everything used in the interior, including the plastics, leathers, and woods were of the best quality. They have a luxurious and kind of an important feel to them. I love the transmission. It has an adaptive learning ability, meaning that if you are just cruising around town, it will stay in a higher gear to keep it quieter. However, floor the throttle and it will immediately drop down one or even two gears for more performance oriented driving. Unfortunately, BMW doesn't offer the Steptronic transmission which is on the 750iL and 740i Sport. The Steptronic is similar to the normal transmission in that it has a normal drive mode with the adaptive learning ability, and a sport mode. However it also has a manually shifting feature, in which you tap the gear lever forward or backward to manually change gears. Anyway, back to the rest of the interior. I selected the Active Comfort seats, which sort massage your body at precise intervals. Very nice feature, reduces fatigue a ton. In the rear, there is a ton of leg room. The rear seats were also heated as a result of the cold weather package. They also get their own climate control in the back standard. 
The climate control is excellent. Front passengers can adjust for their own temperature and fan speed separately. 
Now onto some of the bad parts of this car. If you buy this car, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE OWNERS MANUAL. Trying to operate the dash without reading it will get you into a load of trouble. Second, the sound system was a bit of a letdown. Its not bad by any account, however having 440 watts pushed through 14 speakers along with digital sound processing should have given much better sound. Its not like your not going to get the car because the sound isn't good, but I just expected a little better.
That's pretty much it. Not a bad car at all.
