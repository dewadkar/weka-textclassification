            In my other review I talk about how much I enjoy this vehicle, But it does have a problem, chances are if you own a 1999 or early production 2000 Alero, Grand AM and/or Malibu, you might also have this problem.

You will notice the problem when you lightly apply the brakes, the car will jerk as it slows down. A common problem when your disc brake rotors warp and that is exactly what is happening.

The good news is that the boys at GM are aware of this problem and have a repair, they have a replacement rotor that should hold up better. My dealer is going to do the GM prescribed repair, which involves replacing the rotors and pads.

I will have a follow up after the repair is done and car gets some mileage on it. By the way this problem started showing up after the car ONLY HAD a couple of thousand miles on it. (less than 3500)

UPDATE: Due the large number of vehicles that are involved, the replacement rotors probably will not be in stock. As a result your dealer may turn the rotors to get you by, like they did I my car. The good news is that my dealer insisted that they be replaced and got my name on a waiting list for the rotors. They will be replaced along with the pads early Sept 00. I will follow-up with another update.

2nd UPDATE: In September my dealer replaced the front pads and rotors with a brand new style rotor. According to my service rep this was the very first time that this style rotor had been received from GM. Which is probably bad news for those of you that had them replaced earlier. In fact a co-worker with a Chevy Malibu with the same rotor problem has already had the replacement rotors warp, they were the previous style.

The brakes with this new style rotor so far work excellent.<br><br>
