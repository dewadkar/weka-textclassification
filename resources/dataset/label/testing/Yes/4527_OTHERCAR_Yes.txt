            I have owned a Finepix 6800 for a year. I sold it and "upgraded" to the F601 for a few reasons... its tighter, smaller body and its 640x480 (VGA) video with sound.

I've heavily researched every camera and tried out several, including Canon (S30, S230, G2) and Olympus models (4040, 5050).

I'm a half-serious amateur photographer but I find most of my shots are of travel and family. Occasionally I take the time to do some more creative still life and landscape shots. And once in a while I'll use it for work (I'm a designer). The F601, for a point and shoot, does an excellent (!) job of outdoor shots. I've printed and framed 8x10's at not even the highest resolution.

While I think a true "enthusiast" wants a larger camera with external flash, etc... I really think this almost fits that category, especially if you want a take-anywhere camera.

I like the F601 because I can slip it in  shirt or coat pocket. I don't want to have anything bulkier. I considered the bulkier cameras like G2 and 5050. But I knew I'd hesitate to take them with me. While the F601 doesn't have their lens size and optional features, it has manual controls like shutter and aperature priority if you want it.

My experience has reflected what the major review sites found. There are very few chromatic aberratons (purple fringing) and the images are a pleasing sharpness. Like most compacts, there is some barrel role at full wide angle. No noticeable distortion at telephoto. One subtle negative is in flesh tones when using a flash under incandescent lighting &#150 there is a slight warm cast and skin looks a little "peachy". I don't know how this compares to other cameras.

Where the F601 (and the Fuji S602 and Canon S230) are unique is their ability to shoot 640x480 full-frame video. I didn't want to spend $1,000 on a dv camera and have an extra bag to carry around. While it's only 15 fps and is a little grainy, it's the best video around on a digital still camera.

I like the vertical format of the body. I have large hands and it's comfortable. And I love the docking cradle. I just leave the camera there all the time. Easy transfer, easy charging. But you don't have to use the cradle, which is also nice (mine came included in the price of the camera - $699 Canadian)

The menu system is about as user-friendly as most I've tried. I'd rather have the LCD and dials of a larger camera but I understand the compromises of a small camera body. The menu navigation button that also serves as the zoom control can be really handy and also sometimes a little tricky. But it's just a matter of getting used to it.

Finepix Viewer software is average. But sufficient for organizing photos. I do all my image manipulation in Photoshop. Video Impression is bothersome.

The battery life is quite good for a small battery. I was shooting family throughout the day for about four days over Christmas and it still had juice.

Another feature I've used quite a bit is the audio recording. I've done interviews for work (I'm also a writer) and it works great as a "tape" recorder.

As far as digital cameras go (which all have that annoying shutter-lag problem and extensive menus to navigate) this is a winner. It's quite fast in all areas and nice to carry around. I sold all my film equipment a year ago and haven't looked back. Digital is just too much fun.
