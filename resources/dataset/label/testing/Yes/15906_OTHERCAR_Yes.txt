            I finally did it.  I broke down and went out and bought a new car this week after getting sick and tired of my Pontiac 2000 SE breaking down all the time.  (for a review of that car, see my profile page)

The car I bought?  Yes, a brand, spanking-new, Mercury Sable 2000.

Before I decided on this car, I'd test drove about five others, including my dream car, a red Mustang convertible, a Chrysler Concord, a Dodge somthing-or-other that I couldn't see over the dash in (I'm short), a Ford Taurus, and a Hyundai.  

Now, if I didn't live in Maine, I probably wouldn't have even hesitated about the Mustang since I've been drooling over these cars ever since I learned to drive.  My ultimate car, which I swear to own someday, is a Stingray....ah, yes, what a dreamer I am... what can I say?

But the other day, after test-driving all these other cars, I decided upon this New 2000 Mercury Sable, four door, GS, dual-air-bag, beautiful sedan.  In my favorite color.  Metallic Forest Green.

Oh, sure, many people pick out their cars merely by color, but not me... oh no, I didn't squeal when I saw the beautiful color of green...oh no...uh uh...then I looked at the sticker, saw the price and said, &quot;Hey, this puppy is a lot cheaper than the other ones I was looking at!&quot;  Then, I searched the sticker for the other four essential &quot;Must-haves&quot; when picking out a car for myself.  As the ex-wife of a sports car driver, I had it ingrained inside me that I did not want any car that doesn't at least have 6 cylinders, air bags, cloth interior, and rack and pinion steering.  Luckily, this beautiful green car had them all.  

For those who aren't familiar with the term &quot;rack and pinion&quot; it merely means that there isn't any &quot;play&quot; in the steering wheel ... when you turn the steering wheel, it turns the tires, they hug the road much better, thus safer....OK -- for those of you who are car whizzes, please don't give this lady a sigh of disgust... this explanation is merely my way of describing it.  I'm not an expert, nor do I claim to be, I'm merely a woman who hates having the steering wheel float around while I'm driving.

The new style of the Mercurys this year are tremendous.  I knew someone who had a 1997 Sable and the style is much different.  I, personally, like this 2000 style much better.  The front hood/headlights are much classier in design than the old types.  Although the back window is more angled than earlier years, and this may be a con to some people, I'm not sure.

As a short person, I only have two cons to this car out of everything I've seen so far (I've only owned the car for three days, so expect another epinion within a few months to let you know how it has performed) -- one problem, is the high head rest on the driver's side seat.  If you're short, you will be unable to see behind you while reversing.  Of course, this top headrest is removable, so I was quite happy about that, and have done so when I've had to reverse out of my rather long, narrow driveway.  The other con about this car is the inability to see the end of the front hood.  HOWEVER, the seats are controlled electronically, and this I consider a major plus, because after maneuvering the driver's seat up and forward, I'm able to sit comfortably higher than in most other cars.  (If you're short, by the way, don't even bother trying out the Chrysler Concord... I couldn't see the hood from that driver's seat no matter what I did).

If you need a nice, safe family car, I suggest at least trying this car out.  Mercury Sables have the same engine design as the Taurus, but the Sable is considered &quot;higher end&quot; as far as price and style.  At around $19,900, this four door sedan is heavy, great to drive, and seems reliable.  I will update this opnion when I've driven the car for a few months, however, to give you an idea of upkeep.  Or you can email me to find out if I've had any severe trouble with it since buying it.
