            I recently purchased a used 1995 Carrera2.  The car is as solid as the new cars in the dealership and it cost considerably less.  The body style of the 95-98 Carrera appeals more to me because I find the new Boxster and new 911 fronts to be so similar that they blend together in the road.  The car is air cooled just like Ferdinand wanted it.  The car rumbles, roars and screams as the tach passes 4000 rpm.  The handling is legendary, but takes a smart driver as you can still get the tail loose, unlike the over assisted, over controlled new Carrera's.  The new car is more like a Lexus SC400.  I recommend this vehicle to anybody that can afford it.  When you compare a used Porsche's price, handling, styling, and performance to newer vehicles it becomes clear that the 1995-1998 Carrera's are an excellent all around value.<br><br>
