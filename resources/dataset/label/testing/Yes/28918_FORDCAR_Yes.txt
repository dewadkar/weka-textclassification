             In my opinion this vehicle is safe and loads of fun to drive.I use it for many of things in my daily routine such as hauling my boat around from the different rivers in the area i live. Me and my wife (to be) use this vehicle every day. I drive to and from work every day which miles wise is about 100 miles a day and it always seems to get me were I need to be.
 
 With the v-8 engine I have lot's of power under the hood and that help a lot when pulling your trailer up steep hills. I have not yet got the opportunity to drive this new vehicle in the snow but it is just a matter of time tell i can. See I have the 1999 Ford Explorer with all wheel drive and towing package. This vehicle comes with many of options all included in the price of the vehicle such as the mirrors dimming and the compass control on the rear view mirror it will also alert you if driving conditions are icy,I have a c-d player and a six disk changer in the console with excellent sound. This all comes alarmed with keyless entry for those times you may lock your keys in the car. You can drive this vehicle in comfort with the leather seats and sun roof for those nights you just want to sit back and watch the stars.
