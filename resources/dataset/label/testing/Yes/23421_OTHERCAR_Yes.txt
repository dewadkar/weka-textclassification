            Olds has a problem! How do you tell the world you�ve (finally) built a world-class automobile? It�s an image thing. By reputation, Olds couldn�t have done this. The over sixty (I had to say that since I�m over 50) set probably can�t appreciate this car�s true nature.

Actually, this division has been marching to a new drummer for some time. My �92 and �95 Olds 88 LSS�s appear to have been just the beginning of much more solid engineering to come from Lansing (if it wasn�t for CAF�, we might have had an 88 class car).

The 2000 Intrigue has slightly above common styling. The interior rates with any car in its class � all have a few shortcomings. But you�ll have to step up a class or two to avoid these issues. Don�t misunderstand this to mean that the interior of the Intrigue is a phony. Some issues were very creative. How many cars have you seen with removable ashtrays!
For the driver, everything needed is nearby and simple. The controls, while pretty much GM standard issue, are very useful. The dash and instrumentation rate very highly � most of the car�s special features are accessible without complex computer knowledge.

Now, we get to the good part. Until this Intrigue, I have only driven overhead camshaft cars one time. I didn�t appreciate the difference. GM and Olds are making a bold statement hear � the beginning of the end for cast iron block perhaps! Never mind that. Get behind the wheel, get some open highway in front of you and do what feels natural. If it isn�t instant love, have your pulse checked!

However, I do have two complaints. 1) Why did Olds take so long to build this car? 2) I�m going to lose this car to my wife in a few months (she wants it now, but I�m resisting). She is the toughest critic I know and she likes it. No, she loves it! The first time I�ve heard this since her beloved �72 Impala slid out of our driveway for the last time.
