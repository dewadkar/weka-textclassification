            My parents bought the Mercedes-Benz C-280 sudan in 1996, and at the time it seemed like a very great car at a good price. I mean, with a strong engine (2,799-cc SOHC 18-valve V-6, high-pressure die-cast alloy cylinder block, alloy heads), net power of about 194 hp @ 5,800 rpm, a Magnesium 2-stage resonance intake system, excellent exterior and transmission all for a base price of about $35,000, who wouldn't? The first drive back home from the auto dealer was the greatest experience of all. It felt like the engine was calling my name with its nice, enticing roar, and the new smell of new car just got to me. The handling was great, the steering was awesome and even the steering wheel felt good! This was in 96.

Now it is the year 2000. It has been 4 years since my parents purchased their C-class, and now i am starting to rethink their decision. Ever since the second year, the car has been having many &quot;technical difficulties.&quot; The brakes started to screech whenever it came to a stop, 
and the interior became very incomfortable as time passed on (probably because I grew a few inches then). My parents had to take the car to the shop a few times in ONE year, and it took many repairs. But the car has a lot of mileage on it, and it is still a strong engine on the road. With $35,000, not a bad deal, but I suggest you save your money.
