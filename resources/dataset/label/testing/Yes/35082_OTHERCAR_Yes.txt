            We bought this vehicle used a bit over a year ago and it's still running strong!
The body seems to be pretty well made.  We've got the loaded version and it has tinted windows and of course, the luggage rack on top.  It's white and is now beginning to show signs of paint chipping off....but hey, the thing is 9 years old now.
The van has been tremendously reliable for my family.  My wife is the primary driver.
Everybody told me to "stay away from mini-vans", but we didn't have many options since we have 3 kids.  I've been nothing but pleased with the vehicle and I really enjoy driving it more than any other car we've had (Honda Accord, Honda Civic, Dodge Colt).
The van is really nice on the inside and I wouldn't trade those tinted windows for anything!!!  They really keep the temperature down in the van.
We have plenty of luggage room in the back since it's the "grand" caravan.  We have no problems fitting all our luggage in the back for long vacations.  All three kids seat comfortably and the captain's chairs in the middle are great for adults.  The seats are a bit heavy to remove, but I can remove them by myself.
I also have a tow package on the back of our van.  I've been able to tow trailers loaded with furniture with no trouble.  However, unlike many big trucks, you do feel the trailer tug every once in a while.
The v6 engine is strong and has good pickup.  We get pretty decent gas mil. (in my opinion) for a van.  We get about 20 miles to the gallon on the open road.
Lastly, the van is extremely comfortable!  You just can't beat captain chairs!  The driver's seat on our loaded version is completely electronically adjustable in all sorts of ways.  We also have the digital readout on the ceiling that tells you your mpg, temperature, etc.
