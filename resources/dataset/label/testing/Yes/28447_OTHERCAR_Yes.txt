            I bought my Toyota Avalon because my husband loves big cars.  I have always driven small cars, i.e. Honda Accord, and my husband complained about &quot;feeling cramped with no room&quot;.  We have two children so if we ever went on a &quot;road trip&quot; we always borrowed my inlaws Buick.  So, when I saw this Avalon, I just test drove it to make my husband happy.  WELL... I absolutely LOVE MY AVALON.  It is nice, roomy, comfortable, inexpensive on gas, low maintenance, and so much fun to drive.  I can't believe that my husband and I actually agree on a vehicle.  It doesn't handle like a big car, but it is nice and roomy.  I don't necessarily enjoy the large payment that came with my car, but it all measures out because I enjoy it so much.  What I really enjoy about the Avalon is that is doesn't remind you of a &quot;family car&quot; or a &quot;singles&quot; car.  This car suits all ages, from twenty to sixty.   <br><br>
