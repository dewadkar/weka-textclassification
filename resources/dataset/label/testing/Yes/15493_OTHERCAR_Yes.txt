            The Digital Mavica is a great camera.

The Zoom is superb, it is the best zoom I have found on any digital camera that is a fixed lense (aka, you cant change lesses).

Just the fact that it uses disks is great.  Everyone has hunderds of disks laying around, theres hundreds of rolls of film.  And if you dont have any disks, just wait a month till AOL and the rest of the ISP's send out thier programs (other wise disks are like 50 for $10)

The amount of pictures that can be stored on a disk in normal quality, 640x480 is about 20.  Now, the normal quality is really nice, and 640x480 is close to a full page picture, so you shrink it down and send it, print it, what have you in even better quality

It can go up to 1024x768 with high quality and still get several picture on the disk.

An added bonus is that it has video capability.<br><br>
