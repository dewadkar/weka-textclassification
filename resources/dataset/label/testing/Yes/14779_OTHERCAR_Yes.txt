            I just bought a used 1997 Mercury Mountaineer.  I don't know how I lived without all the cargo space!  It has every feature imaginable.  The only drawback I see is that it sits too low. These vehicles need to be higher off the ground and have 16&quot; tires.  Inside it seems like you are driving a station wagon it is so low.  I had a truck and wanted an enclosed back.  This is nothing like a truck.  I wish I had my truck back and just cut off the back and enclosed it.  The covered space is definitely an advantage.  There needs to be vehicle developed that is a truck with an enclosed back that you can move around in.  The Mountaineer is not it.<br><br>
