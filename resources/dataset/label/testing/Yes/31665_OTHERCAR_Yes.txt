            This is our second Chevrolet Conversion Van we have owned within the past six years. The first was a 1992 low top that had many mechanical problems. These problems I contribute to inept mechanics that could not fix a bike if given the opportunity. Our love for the large size van also brought along a few expensive issues we had to deal with.  First there was the extremely bad gas mileage because of the size of the engine, a 350 cu.in V8, which was a necessity with such a large vehicle.  Then there was the expense for replacement tires.  The tires recommended was a large truck style tire when replaced cost well over $100. each.

After experiencing those mechanical problems with the 1992 Van we decided to make a drastic mistake and sacrifice the comfort of a full size conversion van, so we purchased a minivan with a record for mechanical reliability. After just one year of driving around the country in an extremely reliable vehicle, but an incredibly uncomfortable minivan, we decided to give Chevrolet another chance. 

Our decision to make this change back to the large conversion van has not been regretted since February of 1999, when we purchased a Chevrolet, 1500 Express, and high-top Mark III Conversion Van. We are now very happy with the comfort of a large van, once again. This van comes with all leather seats including the couch for a rear seat, that electronically folds down to a queen size bed.  The two middle Captain�s chair style seats can be removed if the extra room is needed. The luxury of our large conversion van far outweighs the minivan's lack of amenities. We have a TV and VCR located above the rear seats in the upper part of the high-top extension. There is a separate stereo system with headphones located in the rear side panel for passengers sitting in the rear, if they would prefer different music other then what is playing on the CD or Stereo in the front passenger seating area.  Located inside the upper part of the high-top extension are many storage compartments.  These come in extremely handy on long trips.  

We enjoy the electric power windows, heated side-view mirrors that will melt any ice during the winter months to keep a view of the road on each side of you unobstructed. The power front driver�s seat comes in very handy when my wife and I change driving positions so often.  The alloy aluminum wheels were not my first choice, but it was included in a deal I could not refuse. 

One word to the wise, make sure you purchase the larger engine size, it gives you the power you need when you need it and the overall gas mileage is not too different between the large and smaller engines.

The handling for this large Chevrolet conversion van is extremely smooth and performs incredibly well under quick decision changes in the road conditions.  A 4 speed with overdrive automatic transmission helps with the overall gas mileage on extended long non-stop highways.  

In conclusion, we are extremely satisfied with our 99 Chevrolet Conversion Van and if you are leaning towards buying one, take the plunge; you'll never regret your decision.
