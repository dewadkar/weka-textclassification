               The "Blue Deuce" is what my boyfriend calls my Buick Skylark.  I bought it from his step Dad who sells used cars for $1,000.  For that price you just expect the car to run and get you where you need to go.  That is all that I expected.  It is a Custom made car.  
  
  For being as old as it is it does run really well.  I needed a cheap car that could get me back and forth to school a few times, but most of all I needed it so that I could get a job.  I needed the transportation up here at school.  The first week I had it, it ran fine.  It then started to just shut off when I was driving it.  I did not know what was wrong.  I had my boyfriend look at it and he decided that it was the muffler.  He got that replaced and it runs good again.  It has gotten me back and forth from school to home 2 times so far, that is about 320 miles.  And it has not given me any problems.

   I really love that it has the front wheel drive.  I live in Michigan and that really helps in the snow.  I have not got stuck with it yet.  If you need something cheap that will get you where you need to go, then find one of these cars.  It is an oldy but a goody too!!
