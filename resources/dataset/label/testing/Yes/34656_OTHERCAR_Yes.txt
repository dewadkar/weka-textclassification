            This is a great car, for familes with small kids..or even tennagers. This van seats six people comfortably in it's seats...but seven people a little tightly packed. The great thing about this vehilce is the automatic door feature. You can open the door from three seperate places...the back, the keyless door remote, or even up front in the drivers reach. The driver also as the abblitity to turn the automatic feature off. The Montana does guzzle gas..It does get poor gas mileage. But is worth it..for the roominess. The seats come out with great ease. But when you do get them out they are very heavy. I think this minivan is a very good buy and great for any family..<br><br>
