            If you are looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable 4-door vehicle that seats up to 5 persons, this is the car for you.  If you occasionally need to have 6 persons in the vehicle, don't read further!

I had the inclination to purchase an Impala last October.  Of course, I took test drives at a couple of Chevy dealerships.  The 2000 Impala was as comfortable as the 1999 Toyota Avalon I drove, and rode more smoothly than the 2000 Toyota Camry &amp; the 2000 Saturn.


The cars tested had stupendous acceleration from a dead stop.  It handled wonderfully on both wet &amp; dry roads.  The theater seating made the rear seat passengers part of everything going on in the front seats. 

The added &quot;creature comforts&quot; like the heated front seats &amp; side mirrors made me sorry I don't live on Long Island in the winters where I would surely get the full use of them.

The only drawback to this vehicle is the lack of availability of a front leather bench seat.  Chevrolet has printed propaganda (which I had to point out to salespersons in 2 dealerships) stating a leather bench front seat would be available beginning 10/99.  Needless to say, it has yet to materialize.  As I already have a 1994 Mercury Cougar w/bucket seats &amp; the inconvenience of having to take 2 cars even once a year (when there are 6 people going to dinner for example) is enough to make me want a 6 passenger vehicle.<br><br>
