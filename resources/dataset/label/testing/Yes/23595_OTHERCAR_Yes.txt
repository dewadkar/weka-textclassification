            After waiting for almost 2 years for the Japanese market Toyota Altezza to come to America, it finally happened.  Badged as a Lexus, the IS300 came to America with a strong inline 6 directly from the non-turbocharged toyota supra.

  It sounded like a dream come true to me, and it was.  I test drove thsi car 2 weeks ago adn loved it.  It has a firm, yet good riding suspension, and it handles beautifully.

  The 17 inch wheels look gorgeous and come with sticky Bridgestone tires, which are the better of the two offered, Bridgestone and Goodyear.  The interior is full of amenities and looks good also.  It features brushed aluminum and edgy curves along with leather and suede seats.  And oooohhhh the exterior.  In my opinion it is the most beautiful sedan on the market, and the tail lights are very hip.  

   Buy this car over the BMW 330i, and you will gain better resale value and reliability to boot.  The price is thousands less than the Bimmer or even the audi.  The only loss is the fact that the manual is not availible until next year. If you chsoe not to waith though, you have an automanu-matic transmission that is smooth and precise.
