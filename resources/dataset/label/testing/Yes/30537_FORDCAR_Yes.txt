            Although this review may not sound favourable, I have attempted to list everything that has gone wrong since owning this car when new, so that the reader may know what to expect if buying a used one. This model was updated in 1997, so if you get a '96 in good shape you should expect 2 or 3 trouble free years from it before getting the yearly "big fix" expense.

We bought this car to replace two others- my wife's rusted-out '78 Honda and my '79 V8 guzzler (Pontiac). My wife is more comfortable driving a smaller car, and this was about the same size as the Honda. A bit of research led me to the re-designed in '91 (for '92) Escort. I had a feeling this would be a good little car because under the Ford skin lie the mechanicals of a Mazda 323/Protege.

I paid about $12,500 Cdn in Jan '92, which included 4-speed auto, AM/FM cassette, A/C, electric mirrors, and (uniquely) cruise control and NO roof rack. On-the-road price after all the fees and taxes was closer to $16K loonies.

This little car has gone 150,000 Km (that's 90,000+ miles) with very little done to it beyond routine maintenance (oil 3 times a year or 5000Km, tranny flush & rad coolant every 3 years or so) and it runs the same as when it was new. It is used mostly for short trips in town (shopping, school activities, etc) but once a year we pack it to the hilt and take off south to S.Carolina or Florida, plus the odd trip farther north in Ontario.

It starts on the first crank in all types of weather, and has never left us stranded (except my wife couldn't start it one day- trouble came clear at the mechanic's).

The spark plugs and oil filter are within  easy reach for the do-it-yourselfer.

Ignition system is "distributerless" electronic and maintenance free. I replaced the wires after 9 years even though it was probably not necessary.

The headlight bulbs are a little tight to reach but not too difficult. The head and taillight bulbs burnt out after 2 or 3 years but I only had to change one headlamp since. The taillight lenses remove easily. Bulbs do not burn out often, unlike in another review here. Aftermarket bulbs (MotoMaster made by GE) seem to last longer. The originals were Sylvania.

Front disc pads last about 50,000 Km while the rear shoes last about 100K, although the rears should be cleaned and adjusted manually once a year or so, otherwise the brakes become a bit "spongy" (the owner's manual doesn't mention this). Wifey did a 180 degrees with a panic brake on ice a few years back. It's best to keep the rear brakes tight for the winter.

The ride is a little harsh going over bumps, but the car generally handles well. It is a bit noisy at highway speeds. The front seats are comfortable on short runs but need added back support on longer trips. The seatbacks recline almost horizontal if you need to catch some ZZZZ's.

The serpentine belt was replaced at  80K, the timing belt at 120K. The water pump was replaced at that time too, as a precaution against paying the labour twice.

Other parts replaced include...

Body Side Moldings- re-glued after 1 year, under warranty.

Tires- well, that's a given. The originals were Michelins, a rather small 175/70 R13. These were changed to R14s for the '94 model, I believe.

Wiper arms- lost their spring tension after 2 years- replaced under warranty. OK ever since.

Outer tie rod ends- prematurely worn after 30,000 Kms, not covered by warranty. This is a known weak point in these cars. Replace with good quality aftermarket parts, NOT the $16 ones (which wear out like the originals).

Cruise Control- unable to set, after 2 years. Switches in the steering wheel replaced under warranty. No trouble since.

A/C condenser- replaced after 4 years, extended warranty.

Left Rear Door Weatherstrip (Driver's side)- replaced 4 times, twice under warranty, once for $90, the next time I refused to pay! This time the dealer glued it on with Goop or something and it's been OK for 4 years. This is the only part of the car that never fit right, yet Ford never admitted to a problem.

Rear springs- cracked at the bottom coil, replaced this year. Probably from the annual overloaded trip down south.

Fuel filter- a $10 part, but what a lot of work to replace. It's against the firewall with a lot of stuff in the way.

Spark plugs- every 2-3 years. Good for 50K Km but if you leave them in that long they are difficult to remove.

Exhaust system- The pipes lasted 8 years, but then the whole thing was replaced after 10 years. $400!! Wow. Bet the new one won't last that long!

Rad- after 9 years

Other annoyances- 

"Buzzing" sounds from the exhaust system after 4 or 5 years. Eliminated by removing or clamping various shrouds that tended to rust off. The rest of the exhaust is (was)stainless steel and lasts 9-10 years as I mentioned previously.

"Check coolant" light comes on intermittently for no apparent reason. Not worth fixing. Probably a bad sensor.

Wiring to rear liftgate- developed a short where the body meets the gate after about 7 years- causing rear wiper not to work, and other electrical malfunctions. Re-spliced OK.

Struts holding the liftgate up- weak in cold weather, after 8 years. Not worth fixing. I keep a small vise-grip handy.

Key warning beeper- Beeps for no reason with the door open and the key out, after 8 years. Just an annoyance, but like the boy who cried wolf it's easy to leave the lights on. By the way, the ignition switch eats keys (files them down). I make a new copy once a year or so.

Highway acceleration- The 88 hp 1.9 litre EFI 4 cyl makes a lot of noise when you stomp on the accelerator, but doesn't produce much oomph. It's wise to plan well ahead AND click the A/C off when passing on a 2-lane highway. Climbing long steep hills at highway speed can cause the auto-tranny to hunt between 4th and 3rd (sometimes 2nd). In this case, it's best to lock it in 3rd (the "D" without the circle around it).

A/C- Lately it doesn't like to come on when the weather is extremely hot. Has a mind of its own. Will be expensive to service since it uses R12.
UPDATE- Aug 28, 2002- My mechanic replaced the A/C relay, a $22 part, and it's been fine ever since. It was replaced as suspect only, because the darn thing would NOT fail while the mechanic was looking! Still a mind of its own.

It sounds like I'm really dissing the poor little car, but it ran almost trouble-free until it was 8 years old. Now it's $400 here, $300 there, but this happens to every old car. I suppose next will be the alternator and/or starter.
