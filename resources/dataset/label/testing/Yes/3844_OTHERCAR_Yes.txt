            When I searched for a used car last year, I never expected that this car would come my way.  I had set a budget of $4,500 and found myself hard-pressed to find a car that fit that budget without compromising in some other area (age, mileage, size, styling).

In fact, I was still stinging over a deal that fell through on a Geo Prizm (a great car in its own right) when along came an ad in the paper for a '93 Olds Achieva.  With just 65,700 miles on it and things like alloy wheels and anti-lock brakes, I was amazed that the seller wanted just $4,100 for it.  I figured (per a check on the www.edmunds.com web site) that it was worth over $5,000, easily.  The seller told me that he was going for a quick sale because his wife would not let him drive his new '99 Olds Alero coupe until he sold the Achieva.

The day I bought it, it felt more like I made a grand rather than spending over 4 grand.  14 months later, it has only needed the requisite oil changes, and a battery replacement (it had the original Delco battery in it when I bought it).

I used to have a prejudice against American-engineered cars (my dad was among the many who migrated to the Japanese in the '70s and '80s), but Olds has changed my mind.  One possible reason is that around the time my Achieva was built, Olds GM John Rock had repositioned the struggling division as a Saturn-like import fighter.  And it must have impressed its previous owner; after all, he did get another Olds.

In terms of performance and comfort, I really can't comment much because the Olds offered a VAST improvement over the Ford Festiva I had before it, which felt like driving a cardboard box.  Consumer Reports once called it &quot;an uninspired rental car,&quot; but the Quad 4's acceleration on the freeway never ceases to impress me.  I have no complaint with the interior at all.  And it's so smooth when driven between 40 and 50 MPH.

I like the clean styling and straight lines of the Achieva.  If you like more slippery styling, look elsewhere.  :)

I have read a few comments that mention the head gasket problem.  From what I have gathered from previous research, the original (OEM) head gaskets in the Quad 4 engines are crappy and I am simultaneously ticked off and not surprised that GM did not offer to fix this problem for free (or at a substantial discount, even).  (Apparently, the replacement head gaskets come from a different supplier and do not leak.)  It just so happens that my Olds has a Quad 4 engine.  (At the price I bought it for, I figure that I can earmark several hundred dollars for this.)

I have also read about the &quot;check oil&quot; light.  It's a defect in the circuitry in the dashboard that is doing this (provided that you have checked the oil and it isn't abnormally low).<br><br>
