            When my husband and I went &quot;new&quot; car shopping, we were really looking for a new second hand car.  I'm so glad we both decided on the Pontiac Montana.

We rented a Pontiac TransPort while on vacation in Sept., 1998.  We liked it so much that we said when we're in the market for a new vehicle this is the one we want.  Little did we know that would be less than a week later.

The dealer showed us their used cars/vans.  Why pay $25K for someone else's memories.  My husband then asked about the Transport.  The dealer said the Montana was the replacement for the Transport.  This vehicle is wonderful.

Where do I begin,  well the auto sliding door is a must for parents.  A click of the button and the door slides open for your percious bundles.  The dual control A/C and heating units are marvelous, their are 18 cup holds, the sets fold down easily, there is a cargo net, electric outlet, self sealing tires.  I could go on and on.

Test drive it today!<br><br>
