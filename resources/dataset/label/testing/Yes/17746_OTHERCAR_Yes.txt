            I really like my 2000 Saturn SL.  Its reliable, gets great gas mileage (40 mpg), and looks nice (when I wash it).  I bought my 2000 used from the local dealer with 13,000 miles on it -- in virtually every way, it was a brand new car.

It is configured strangely, however.  This one is a manual transmission, WITHOUT power steering, only an AM/FM radio, and tilt steering and AC.  From what I've been able to find out, whoever purchased this car originally had to tell them specifically to downgrade the radio but do add tilt steering and AC.  Strange.  And, yes, a front-wheel drive, manual transmission with no power steering can be a chore to drive ... 

I've only had one non-routine problem with this car ... when I got it, there was a lot of wind noise on the driver's side.  So, when I took it in for my first oil change, I mentioned it, and they fixed it under warranty (replaced door seal).

My dealer offers a lifetime oil change, which I bought, so its in there every 3000 miles.  And, yes, they take the opportunity to try to sell me high priced unnecessary maintenance (I've never heard of anyone draining, flushing and refilling the brake lines with new fluid -- and why that would be necessary at 30K, when the thing hasn't even gone through a set of pads, I don't know).  I do maintain it well, but I do most of the work myself (another great feature of a Saturn -- you can still work in it!).  It is helpful to me to have the dealer point out stuff that ought to be done at oil change time, however.

There are things that are less than perfect about the Saturn ... but I view these more at the level of picky details.  First, the heater takes a long time to heat up.  On the flip side, in summer, it is a very cool car to drive -- often, having the vents open is enough, and I don't need AC.  The seat is not impressively comfortable, but its okay.  I do drive a lot, which probably makes me pickier about the seat.  And, the driver side arm rest is starting to crack -- again, I do drive a lot.

This Saturn is actually my fourth.  The first one is a 95 SL1 that I bought from the local deal with 95,000 miles on it.  My daughter is now driving it and its over 130,000 miles.  Its been a great car -- its only needed an exhaust system, brakes and an EGR valve since I've had it.  The second one was a 93 SC2 -- not such a good car.  I bought it (cheap) from a private party with about 115,000 on it.  Within 10,000 the head cracked and the car was toast.  You get what you pay for, I guess ... 

The final Saturn I've had was a 94 SL2 for teenage daughter #2.  I bought that one (cheap) from a questionable used car dealer.  It needed an alternator right away, but otherwise was mechanically solid (it used a little oil, too).  However, another driver ran a stop sign and my daughter t-boned them at 45 mph.  The car was totaled, but my daughter and a friend had only minor injuries.  And that's the number one reason I love Saturns.
