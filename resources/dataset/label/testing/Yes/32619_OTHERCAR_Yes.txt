            If you read my other reviews, you will see that my last vehicle was a Ford Explorer Sport.  I loved it but hated the ride.  It was time to finally upgrade to a 4 door and things were starting to break on the explorer.  After looking around, the only that I found that I liked was the GX 470.    It was expensive, but it was worth it!  Most everything is standard other than the navigation system, which we got and the rear DVD player, which we did not.

This being my first luxury vehicle, I was impressed with the interior and all the extras.  The leather was nice and the seat warmers are wonderful.  All the little gadgets such as the side mirrors that tilt down when you are in reverse.  The telescoping steering wheel makes is much easier to get into a comfortable position while driving.  It is very well insulated, for I am always hot in the vehicle even when it is cold outside.

The ride in this vehicle is so smooth that it seems like you are floating above the pavement.  The faster you go, the smoother the ride.  The comfort and sport settings make the ride more or less bumpy according to your desire.  It definately drives like a car, a fast one.  The pickup on it is great!  I often have to step on the breaks because I excelerated too quickly.

We removed the third row of seats for our dogs to utilize the area, and it is very large.  The rear air keeps them cool on hot days.  The swing out door is not the greatest.  I wish it opened up.

The exterior was is very classy.  I already have a door ding and was surprised at how easily the paint came off, that did not impress me.  I'm not fond of the tires.  MY Explorer had deep treads and were sporty looking.  These tires look like car tires.  I'd rather it look more sporty.

The gas mileage is better than expected.  The sticker said 15/18.  I got 22 on the highway and I get 18 around town with a little bit of distance driving.  My explorer never got even 20mpg so I'm happy that a taller, heavier, 8-cyclinder, all wheel drive vehicle does so well.
