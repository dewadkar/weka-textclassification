            I used to take horrible pictures.  2 month after using the G1, I learned a lot about photography and start to produce good pictures.  Friends start to ask me for pictures for their desktop wallpaper.

Unlike other digicams, G1 is designed for people who are interested in photography.  It has decent snap shot capability, but where it truely shines is when you turn to the manual or semi-manual mode, where you start to control your light, depth of field and so on.  The product page on E-Opinion catergorizes G1 as a "Point & Shoot" (P&S) camera.  That is not correct.  This one is a true "Prosumer" camera.

It gets even better when you purchase the lens adapters (I recommend the Lensmate).  The fun game of playing with different filters begins here.  I have not started this yet but really looking forward to it.

The product page of this site also says G1 has no flash.  That is wrong, too.  The built-in flash is very decent.  G1 also has a hot-shoe to connect to an external flash.  The benefit of external is more power, better control, and it is a sure cure of red-eyes.

I have to comment on the body of the G1.  Some people don't like it because it look "plain".  However to me it is one of the good things.  G1 is not flashy and doesn't attract attention (as well as thieves).  The rotating LCD screen has the same benefit of the split body design of Nikon 9xx, only better because it is more flexible.

The battery is simply awesome on the G1.  The proprietary battery cost more, but lasts a full 2.5 hours.  If you buy the AC Delco battery designed for the G1, you can get 3 hours from it.  I can't imagine how people can enjoy photography when they have to change battery every 30-40 min, as in most other digicams.

The G1 takes excellent pictures.  I bought it to take pictures of my new born daughter.  It handled that task with ease: just remember to turn on the macro mode since the infant is so tiny and the camera is usually very close to her.  For those pictures, I can make 8x10 prints easily.  If I use some special software, I can make posters from my pictures.

However I heard people complaining G1's auto mode.  There are also complains on its auto-focusing capability.  I have no experience on the full auto-mode since I think I am beyond that.  My experience on the auto-focusing is that it is as good as most P&S cameras, but don't expect the sophisticated systems found on professional SLR cameras.  After all, you only pay ~$800 for it, which is the price for only the body of a pro-SLR.

I personally don't like the RAW mode.  I don't see difference in picture quality.  However you do get to play with the white balance after you have taken the shot, a big advantage for difficult light situations.  The RAW mode is painful to use.  You can't see the full resolution picture on the camera, therefore you don't know if your picture is sharp until you go home and work on a computer--that is too late!!

<b>Update</b>
Canon just announced G2, a 4MP camera that is much like the G1, only improved.  Although the specs are not good enough for me to dump my G1, it is definitely better.  If you are buying a camera, consider the G2 as a good candidate.  However it won't be available until Sept., 2001.
