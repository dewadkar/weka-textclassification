            It has been our family's dream to get a Mercedes for the past twenty years.  Finally we went to the dealership, and were looking solely at the C-Class, because it was the closest to anything comparable to our price range.  My wife and I test drove it, and were satisfied...how could we not be after driving a 1990 DX Accord for the past 10 years, (which is also a great car...but lets get back to luxury!).  

So we're about ready to go sign the papers when I get a sudden instinct on test driving the e-class.  I knew from the second I sat into it we were going to buy it.  At first my wife despised me for wanting to buy it because this car was primarily going to be for her, and she was concerned about driving such a big car.  ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!  It may seem very large but driving it makes you feel as if you have control over the whole vehicle.  I'm no big car guy, but one thing I can tell you is you will never be struggling to pass the car next to you.  The power on it is astonishing...sometimes even a little more than unsafe.  

There are a few inconveniences on it also:  The emergency brake is initiated by pressing down on the pedal as opposed to pulling it up.  Also, the cruise control is directly above the blinker switch and on numerous occasions have began to speed up having accidentally hit the cruise control.  One other little disadvantage is that if you want to roll up your windows and sunroof from the outside, you must stand directly in front of the driver door for the remote to work.  Other than that, this car is amazing, and highly<br><br>
