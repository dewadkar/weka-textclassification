            Some time ago I test drove a standard, 200 horsepower A6 and was not impressed.  This car, largely because of the lack of power, was not a fun car to drive.  Audi seems to have recognized this problem.  For 2000, they have added two engines to the A6 line-up: a turbo version of the regular six, good for 250 horsepower, and the eight from the A8, good for 300.  The turbo is also available with a 6-speed manual.  Intrigued, I did the only logical thing: I drove all three cars.  This review covers the 4.2.  Two others cover the other two cars.

(Next two paragraphs also in 2.7T auto review.)

For my comments on the styling and interior features of the A6, see my review of the base car.  In sum, I find the unique styling appealing, if a bit round and bulky from some angles.  I believe Audi has the best designed interiors of any German automaker.  

One thing I would add is that the seats could be more supportive.  They are so firm you tend to sit on them rather than in them, and the side bolstering is rather weak.  Maybe the sport seats, not in any of the cars I drove, fix this problem.  This problem also seemed reduced with the Ambiance &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  The leather of this trim set is softer, allowing you to sink into the seat a little.  Though I prefer the appearance of the other trim packages, with their highly textured leathers, this one is the most comfortable.

I found the six a bit unrefined, so looked forward to the eight.  Results in this department were mixed.  The 4.2 is definitely smoother, quieter, and better sounding than the 2.7, but is still not quite where I'd want it.  It's on par with the BMW eight, but not the Lexus eight, in this department.  Think slightly mechanical, with none of the burble of American eights, but none of the intoxicating sounds a Lexus eight is capable of either.

Audi states that the acceleration of this engine is about the same as the 2.7 auto.  Where did the 50 extra horsepower go?  I'd guess extra weight, taller gearing, and a higher torque peak.  While the 2.7T thrusts you back into the seat immediately, the 4.2 takes a bit more time building up momentum.  It's probably quicker at high speeds, but this is America, not the Autobahn.

The transmission in the 4.2 also responds less quickly than that in the 2.7.  I'd guess that fuel economy is the reason.  Both cars are rated 17/24 by the EPA.  Audi had to do something to the 4.2 to get it to match the 2.7 here.  Something like taller gearing and a lazier tranny.  Both take something away from the driving experience.

I drove a car with the $750 big tire option--255/45-17's to be precise.  The fenders are flared wider to clear these puppies.  And they look nice.  What do the extra 40mm's do on the road?  Well, this sucker sticks.  I carved up a church parking lot pretty well, probably going through at least $25 of pricey rubber, and it never quite came unglued no matter what I did with the throttle and steering.  But then the 215's on the 2.7 did nearly as well.  So I'd say that in anything approaching normal driving the 215's are sufficient--not a reason to dis the 2.7, anyway.

The 4.2 has more shock damping, it sits 0.4 inches lower, the track is 1.4 inches wider, and it's a couple hundred pounds heavier.  As a result, the ride in the 4.2 is a bit more composed, despite the lower profile tires.  Ditto for the handling.  This car lacks the tippiness I perceived in the 2.7.  So in the area of ride and handling the 4.2 is the best A6.

Audi is clearly aiming the 4.2 at a higher price bracket.  The tilt and telescope feature is power, while it is manual on the other A6's. And the rear seat is a different design, with quasi-buckets carved out for the two outboard passengers and no center headrest.  Better for two back there, worse for three.  For the German exec car market, where the owner rides in back?

This is easily the most luxurious A6.  But it still lacks the luxury feel of a Lexus somehow.  It doesn't have the liquid moves of an LS400, or even a GS400, perhaps because it wasn't meant to.  But if you want a more mechanical feeling car, and don't desire the ultimate in refinement, then why not go with the 2.7 and save a few bucks?

The 2.7 is more fun, nearly as refined, and over $6k less, even after adjusting for equipment.  So if you want an A6, I'd say to go there.<br><br>
