            The Jeep might not be mine totally, but it is my daily driver.  I am attending college and I drive a 99 cherokee sport.  I don't drive much around the campus but i put about 800 miles on it when i go home for a weekend. The gas milage is what it should be for an engine that size, and I get about 320 miles a tank on the highway, but that's going 80 mph the whole time. I love driving, and this is a fun car to drive.  With a 4.0 litre V-6 engine, this car has enough power to do some nice fish tails and peeling out, the response time is excellent.  I would also like to mention it's off-road potential,and it is great when winter rolls around and the four-wheel drive is engaged.  The only problems that I really don't like are the windsheild wiper(they just barely move any sort of percipitation from the windshield), the headlights(the low beams are way too low), and how it is tough to turn sharp even when i'm moving slow, it feels like the tires are going to pop off.  Other then tose few problems I would recommend buying or leasing one of these,  it has 45,000 miles on it and other then an oil change every 3000, and new brakes there have been no major problems.<br><br>
