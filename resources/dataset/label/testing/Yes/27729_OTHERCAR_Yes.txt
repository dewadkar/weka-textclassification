                 I started looking for a digital camera after I discovered the one included in my Panasonic PV-L750 camcorder had terrible resolution (only 640x480).  I zeroed in on the S-100 Elph at first because it is so compact compared to other cameras and I don't have a lot of spare room in my diaper bag.  This camera is the answer to my space prayers and my image quality prayers.  
     With 2.1 megapixels, the camera produces superb images.  I took the same series of pictures with my Elph that I had taken with my camcorder and there was no contest.  The images from the Elph were sharp, and if I used the Superfine setting, there were no pixel dots in the printed image at all.  You will see a few in the Fine/Large setting and lots in the Fine/Small setting.  The disadvantage to the Superfine setting is that it eats a lot of the space on the 8mb CF card included with the camera.  Since I intend to do mostly portrait photography, I bought another CF card right off the bat (and so should everyone who purchases this camera-at the very least, get a 16-meg card).
    The battery life for this camera could be better, but that's the trade-off for the compactness of the camera.  A good bet would be to buy an extra battery and have one charging at all times.  I've found that a full charge only lasts about half an hour with continuous use.  
     The tiny LCD screen is another disadvantage; again, it's a trade-off on the size.  The Elph does have a nifty zoom feature, however, so you can zoom in on a specific section of an image.
     I've found that the red-eye flash setting doesn't work well with infants-it is good for adults who can follow directions!  Otherwise, I have no problem with the flash system.  I do recommend that for indoor shots one should set the white balance to tungsten for brighter images.
     This camera also has a great Auto-play feature.  By selecting this option, you can view all the images on the CF card in a three-second rotation, so you know right away which images to delete.
     The zoom function of the Elph is great; don't use the digital zoom greater than two-power or you'll have a really grainy image.
     The Stitch Assist mode is great if you take landscape pictures.  You can merge two overlapping images to get a panoramic picture.  It also makes for an interesting full-length image of a person.
     The Elph is very user-friendly.  The commands execute quickly and easily.  The software included was also very easy to navigate.  One warning-if you don't have a USB port on your computer, you'll have to get a compact flash card reader because you only get a USB cable in the package. 
     Overall, I think the Elph is a wonderful product despite the few flaws.  It is pricey compared to other 2.1 megapixel cameras, but the images it produces silenced my objection!
