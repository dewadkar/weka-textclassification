            The Sony MVC family is a great concept and fills a needed place in the market.  For most of us family photographers, it's near perfect.  Carrying around some floppy disks in a camera bag is easy and cheap, and being able to record a short video is great too.

The downside is the picture quality.  It's perfect for posting to the web or emailing.  And for many printing needs it does the trick.  But if you're looking for high-resolution images, it's just not quite there.

I use the camera at work.  My company bought one for pictures to use in proposals, and for many of them, we can doctor the pix well enough in PhotoShop or PhotoPaint.  But occasionally we have to go to a slightly smaller image size than we really want to get the necessary quality.

If you're looking for a versatile family camera, this is a great choice (I won't go into all the features, since they're covered pretty well in other epinions.)  But for professional work, you have to look elsewhere.<br><br>
