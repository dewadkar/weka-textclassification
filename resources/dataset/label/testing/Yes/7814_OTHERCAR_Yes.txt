            My husband's first car out of grad school was the Saturn SC2, red, in 1994. He picked me up in it for our first date and I was impressed with the car (it's the car I wanted to buy but couldn't afford). We had a lot of sentimental attachment to it but had to sell it in 1998.

When our first child came along, we had the Saturn and a Geo Prizm. The Prizm's battery died and our child became very ill so we proceeded to pack us 3 in the Saturn. Well, with our long legs and the infant car seat, we couldn't all fit! After that incident, we decided to look for another car.

We found a buyer eventually but it wasn't easy to sell. Even the car dealers didn't want it because they had other ones on their lot that they couldn't sell (the car had very low mileage and was in mint condition). We wound up getting an OK price for it, but not at all what we should have. We tried to sell it for about 4.5 months (ads, etc.).  

One huge complaint we had with Saturn was how they dealt with the one problem we had with the car. As you probably know, Saturn markets itself as a company &quot;big&quot; on customer service. We REPEATEDLY did not find this to be the case with our problem. The problem was that the driver's side window leaked a lot. With the design of the car and the size of the window, the driver would get drenched if it was raining or in a car wash. We went to 3 different Saturn dealers numerous times to get the problem fixed. Each time, the problem came back quickly. We even wrote Saturn headquarters telling them of our disappointment and we heard NO response. The dealers would promise, &quot;This time it'll work&quot;, but it never did. The last dealer we went to said that this was a common problem in certain models and was honest with us that they don't know how to fix it. Though it seems like a minor problem, we wanted to get rid of the Saturn for a while because of it. If you live in an area where it rains a lot, can you imagine going to work drenched or trying to wipe up the incoming water while driving? It was ridiculous.

I would think they've resolved that problem but we were extremely disappointed with a company that claims and advertises one thing but delivers another. Overall, it was a reliable car though and got good gas mileage. I would recommend it for a single person who doesn't foresee getting married in the near future. <br><br>
