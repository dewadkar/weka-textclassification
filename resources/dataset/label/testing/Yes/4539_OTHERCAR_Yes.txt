            I paid around $50 including shipping for this camera on eBay and am happy with the purchase.  The photo quality is what I would expect out of a VGA camera, having used them before.  The product advertising is misleading in that this camera does not take true 1.3 MP photos and is for all intents and purposes an outdoor camera (since it does not have a flash).  However, I was able to get some decent indoor shots under bright fluorescent lighting or streaming sunlight.  

While the photos are not of a resolution for the photo enthusiast, with good lighting you can get photos that are fine for e-mail and internet.  Outdoors, it even does well in overcast, rainy conditions, especially if you are within a few feet of your subject.  You can also take photos from a distance if you don't mind a less detailed look.  The color of photos taken outdoors either close-up or at a distance is quite good.

The best features of the camera are its portability, ease of use, quick save time (you can take photos close together), and battery capacity and life.  It's a true pocket camera that is slim, lightweight, and perfect for whipping out for impromptu shots.
