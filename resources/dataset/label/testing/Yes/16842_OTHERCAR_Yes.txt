            I had a Dodge Caravan, in fact it was my pride and joy. I didn't think I'd part with it for any reason at all. Then one day I found myself driving a Lumina along a country road and I was totally absorbed by the experience. The Lumina was fast, very responsive and it went exactly where I pointed it. It was great fun to drive, had plenty of power and it was comfortable and quiet - almost unreal to be rushing through the countryside in almost total silence. I was so impressed that my wife bought it! It was a 1994 model and it really was excellent.

So excellent that the Caravan wasn't really enough anymore, so we went out to see if we could find another Lumina, and if it would be good enough to take the Caravan's place. I drove 5. A couple of Pontiac Trans Sports and three Chevy Luminas ranging from 1992 to 1996 models and they were all good. In fact they all felt pretty much the same, but the 3.4L engine in the 1996 model was smooth and delivered power exactly when asked. 

I threw it round a test circuit to see what it was like and it was very good indeed. It felt direct and precise in ways that most cars simply don't. And it didn't feel at all like a minivan... or look much like one either. By the time I'd been behind the wheel for 30 minutes I was hooked. Actually it didn't take anything like that long, but I knew I didn't want to hand the keys back. My wife just asked 'yes or no?' and even though it meant giving up my Caravan, I had no doubt at all.

So what do I like about this oddly styled aerodynamic brick? Almost everything. It gives the most involving driving I have had in years. And it's comfortable too. The seats are a little hard, but then I prefer that anyway, and they support you laterally and keep you solidly located. The ride is firm but comfortable and the noise levels are so low that aside from wind above 60mph, it's sometimes difficult to believe you're moving and the engine's on. 

The Lumina may not be the best thing for everyone, but if you're in the market for a decent car that drives fast and precisely, or you need something that can carry a bunch of people or a load of stuff, go and find a Lumina, a Pontiac Transport or an Olds Silhouette and take it for a drive. If it puts a smile on your face like it did on mine, you'll thank me. This is just an excellent way to get around, and when you think you can take half a scout troupe or Auntie's grandfather clock and half her living room with you, you realize it's also a very versatile vehicle.

It isn't without it's faults. Mostly plastic trim that rattles and sometimes it's too complex and clever for it's own good, but so what. A car is all about getting from one place to another in comfort and with minimum fuss. A Plymouth Reliant can do that. But what it can't do is put a smile the size of the Cheshire Cat's on your face while it does it. A Lumina can. My Lumina did.
