            I got this camera for use as a general camera. I love it because you never have to pay for film, or developing. You can also delete pictures that you do not like, as well as preview them immediately after taking them. It is a very easy camera to use, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. 

I have even started using it as a small business tool. I sometimes sell items on Ebay, and this makes it very easy for the buyer to see what I have to offer, and helps me sell my items faster. Please look and see my pictures, if I have anything for sale it is under the name &quot;Smokemunky&quot; at E-bay.com.

This camera definitely blows its competition away as far as I am concerned. I would recommend this product to anyone in a heartbeat.
