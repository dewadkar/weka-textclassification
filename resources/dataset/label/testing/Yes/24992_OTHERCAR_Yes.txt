            When looking for a car that is affordable, safe, and reliable, look no further than the Chevy Lumina.  The Chevy Lumina has been rated as one of the safest automobiles by insurance companies and by various independent testing labs.  The Chevy 3.1 engine is one of the best engines in production today.  The Lumina has also received high marks in terms of safety.  In the offset collision, which is one of the most common and deadliest of crashes, Lumina rated near the top in all class types of vehicles. I personally own two Luminas', and they are both approaching 200,000 miles each.  They are comfortable to drive, great acceleration, and get good gas mileage.  The lumina, like any type of vehicle has some minor pit falls.  The alternators seem to fail early in the Lumina, and the rear calipers have a steel bushing that seems to stick in most of these vehicles.  However, these problems are minor, as my repair bills on my Lumina's have been minimal.  With regular maintanance, your Lumina will last for a very long time, and I highly recommend this vehicle.<br><br>
