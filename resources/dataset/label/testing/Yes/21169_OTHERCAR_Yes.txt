            Even thought the GS series lexus has not changed it self in the past 3 years it still is one of the top luxury sports cars available today.  In the GS models, you will discover the usual Lexus strengths of superb fit and finish, extremely smooth mechanical systems, and quiet, well-damped interiors. Anyone would also appreciate the excellent packaging, the roomy trunk, and the full range of well-thought-out luxury features.
But unlike other Lexus sedans, the rear-drive GS models are blessed with grippier tires, firmer suspension calibrations, more immediate steering, and hard-wired communication between the chassis and the driver. Whether the pavement is smooth or broken, arrayed in sweeping curves or tight switchbacks, as flat as a pancake or more undulating than a roller coaster, the GS models remain poised and unflustered.
Anyone would certainly enjoy the 300 hp and the steering-mounted shifter buttons of the GS400 when driving for enjoyment. But the GS300 is also impressively quick -- and perhaps it's even better balanced. Both GS models deliver an outstanding blend of indulgence, utility, and driving excitement.
