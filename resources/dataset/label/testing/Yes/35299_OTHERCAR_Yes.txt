            I have had my 96 chevy Corsica since 1997, when I bought the vehicle it only had 33,000 mile on it two years later the car now has 96,000 mile and a load more dents.The car has lived through 2 accidents, missed oil changes and the most I have ever had to do to the car is replace the brake pants. The engine is still perfect even with the wear and tear that I have put it through. I have driven the car in NYC, New Hampshire and I have driven it half way across the country and I have always felt secure that my car would make it where I need to go. The car is also very child friendly , as well as being safe. With automatic windows and doors that lock as soon as you put the car in gear. The highlights go on automatically with light censors and if they don't you know right away you have a break problem.<br><br>
