            I just recently bought a 1994 Ford Probe GT with 40,200 original miles. It has every option that a GT can have. It is equipped with a drivers power seat, power windows and door locks,sunroof, fog lights, V6 24 valve engine,factory cd player, and many other things. Its color is is extremely funky and tough to describe, but it changes from metallic blue to metallic purple to metallic grey. I bought this vehicle because I needed a reliable car to drive back and forth everyday to college which is about 50 miles a day just to go to school. It gives me a extremely smooth ride and has an awesome pickup for a V6. This car has more pickup then my 1987 old chevy camaro I used for my trade in. My first impression of the car made me interested in because of the way it look and the deal I was getting it for a bargain price. I have only had the car for two weeks, but I know for sure this is going to be the best car I have bought. I would recommend any college student to buy this type of car as a reliable affordable type of transportation, but also a nice sporty type of car to go cruising around to pick up the girls.LOL.I wouldn't recommend this car to an elderly couple. Well email me with any questions.<br><br>
