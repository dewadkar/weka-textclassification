            Overall, I highly recommend this vehicle for those looking for a dependable car, &quot;non-flashy&quot; car.  I bought this vehicle used in 1991 with 19,000 miles for $8000.  It has paid for itself many times.  What I love most about the car is its dependability.  The car currently has 160,000 miles and it has never broken down on me.  

I bought the car in Florida have taken it overseas (to Puerto Rico) where the roads are generally in worse condition and the car performed flawlessly (although I went through tires rather quickly).  I returned to the U.S. mainland with the car and have made many trips up and down the East Coast as far North as Rhode Island and the car has performed and kept up.  

For maintenance I perform simple maintenance on the car (i.e., fluid/filter changes, battery changes, brake pads, etc.).  What I like least about the car is that its very poor with respect to power.  The 1.6 liter single injector just doesn't make for a speed demon.  However, as previously mentioned, it more than makes up for this deficiency in reliability.<br><br>
