            I bought my first Honda in 1994.  I was young and stupid, and didn't do any research into buying a new car, but God was leading me by the hand.  I ended up with a brand-new 1994 Civic DX.  At this time the car came standard with A/C and a cassette deck.  The A/C went out pretty quickly, and I had to have it fixed a couple of times before it worked to it's full potential.  I wasn't too crazy about the unibody; one dent and virtually the entire body would have to be replaced.
I now own a 1997 Civic EX, and couldn't be more thrilled.  I bought it brand new, and it has run like a dream.  I am horrible about getting my oil changes, and went a year without one (I know- I'm stupid!).  My point is, I didn't notice any difference in the performance until after a year of driving with the same oil.  The only problems I have had are the windshield washer pump, the driver's side electric window motor, and the driver's side floor mat.  A recall was put out on the floor mat, and they attached an eyelet to hook the mat over.  I haven't had a problem with the mat since then.  When I took the car in for the window motor, they had about twelve other cars with the same problem.  And the windshield washer pump won't spray the fluid onto the windshield; it just kind of dribbles (unless I'm doing about eighty mph).  When I took it into the shop for that, it worked fine (imagine that!).
Other than those three things, I love my car.  Mine is a five-speed, four-cyl., but it gets around like a V-6.  It is sporty and sleek, with room to seat four comfortably (five is pushing it).  The trunk is enormous.  I also have the Honda Care auto plan, and it has been a big help.  For ten dollars a month, it covers all your scheduled oil changes, flat tires, tow charges, etc.  It is a great plan.  There are so many disposable cars on the road these days (i.e. Neon's), and the Honda Civic really stands out in the crowd.  It is great on gas--I spend about ten dollars every two weeks when I am just driving around town.
A Honda is a well-built auto; this is evident when you still see 1970's models on the roads.  This is a great first car, a great second for a family, and great for single people like myself.<br><br>
