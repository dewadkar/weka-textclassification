            Very good camera, especially for the money.  Many features, yet easily understood and used by beginners.  Excellent battery life, use the flip-open photocell for outdoors.  Some washout of LCD in bright sun, but that is just part of the game.  Could have higher focal zoom (3x), but takes excellent pictures.  Panorama feature and macro features very good, easy to use.  Can delete individual or groups of photos just by switching to View mode.  Wonderful camera, my first digital.  I'm extremely happy with it, and with the customer service from Epson!  Flash memory is reasonably cheap, and in lowest resolution you get over 400 photos on a 30 Mb card.  Lowest resolution gives super quality, have only used higher resolutions for portraits and macro shots of flowers.<br><br>
