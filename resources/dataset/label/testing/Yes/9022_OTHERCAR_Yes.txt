            We bought the KIA with everything but the leather package and overall are very pleased.

For an SUV the Sportage gets great gas mileage.  We average around 22 miles per gallon.  The 4-wheel drive is a must living in Michigan.  I feel very safe driving it in icy/snowy conditions.  KIA has a great warranty system, I highly recommend you go to their website (www.kia.com) and read about it before making a decision.  They also provide 24-hr roadside assistance.  Thankfully I can't rate that as we've never needed to use it.

We found that the Sportage compared to other mid-sized SUV's has more leg room in the front seats.  It's a little cramped in the back but the kids have plenty of room and 2 adults can still manage nicely.  The cargo area is very roomy but would be nicer with a cargo net to hold it in when you open the top lifting hatch.  

That said the one thing we really don't like about the Sportage is the hatch.  There are too many steps involved in opening and closing which makes it almost impossible to do it by yourself with your hands full.  The tire swings out to the left, then you have to use the key to open the top lifting hatch.  Just a few too many steps, the real fun starts when you reverse the steps as you have to push the release button on the tire and pull it toward the car at the same time, ugh!

There's also a seal problem with the windows in the back but we've been told it can be fixed, we just haven't taken it in yet.

Overall it's a great car and very reliable.  The price makes it that much better.
