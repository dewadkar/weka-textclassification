            I purchased my Mercedes M320 in April 2001.  I went from the Lincoln Navigator to this much smaller suv.  One of my first observations was the tremendous improvement in the handling.  I really felt like I had control that none of my previous vehicles afforded me.  

<b>INTERIOR</b>
I drive a black with black interior.  One of the fallacies is that the mclass has real leather interior.  It doesn't.  The interior smells like leather, looks like leather, and feels like leather.  It is an incredible imposter and as far as I am concerned just as good.  It has worn extremely well and looks brand new.  

The seats are incredibly comfortable even when I'm in the car for many hours a day.  I have power seats and can adjust to any position with a simple push of a button. 

 We purchased the extra third row jump seats for the times when we are carpooling.  These are very inconvenient and when in use provide very little storage room in the rear.  There is almost no leg room at all.  

<b>HANDLING</b>
This car hugs the road.  I drive with confidence because of the incredible response and handling.  It feels like the road and I are one.  When I drive other cars it takes a serious adjustment to the play in steering or the loose way the tires seem to *grip*.

<b>BRAKES</b>
The brakes on this car are firm and dependable. Even in the most torrential Florida rain I have not experienced any hydroplaning and slamming on brakes due to sudden emergencies has brought me to a quick and safe stop.  

<b>BUTTONS AND CONTROLS</b>
All of the controls are convenient to use and within my arms reach. The placement of the cd player is really inconvenient.   To change cds you must stop the car, open the hatchback, and unscrew the outside part.  This is much too involved for me.  To play the cd is easy however.  You just hit a number on the pad for the cd and then push the knob one way or the other for the track.

The air conditioning, cruise control, power doors, power seats, sunroof, operations are very comfortable to access.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
Our car has the integrated phone system which is well worth the extra dollars.  My phone plugs into the console and I can have a conversation without picking up the handset at all.  The reception is clear.  The directory of stored numbers shows up on a small tv screen or I can dial right on the dial pad next to it which is convenient to reach.  This has kept me able to drive safely and conduct business at the same time.

There is also the option available for a navigation system.  I didn't buy it but I hear it is a valuable tool for people who drive long distances to unfamiliar places.  

The bose stereo system is wonderful.  I am not an electronics expert but this is the best sound system I own including my residence.  The cassette is hidden behind the tv screen.  I dislike that the cd changer is all the way in the back where the spare tire is.  I find this incredibly inconvenient and will sometimes keep the same 6 cds in for months because of the hassle of changing them.

I like the garage door opener which cannot be activated if the car is off.  This prevents someone from breaking into your car and then capable of opening your garage door for access to your house.

The key flips down into a base so it doesn't actually look like a key at all.  You can open and lock your car from the key.  You can also activate the alarm and use it as a panic button.  

<b>WHY I AM SELLING</b>
Other than storage and seating capacity I have been very happy with my Mercedes ML320.  I am in the process of selling right now only because I need more space.  I am finally making the move to a minivan.  I am mentally preparing myself for the difference in quality and maneuverability in exchange for a car that seats 7.  When my children are grown I intend to purchase another Mercedes suv....for now I'm giving in and becoming another mini van driving mom.  If there is anyone interested I'm selling my car for $29,000 which is 3,500 below NADA.
