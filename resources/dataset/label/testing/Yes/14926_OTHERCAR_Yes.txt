            This camera is the greatest thing I have ever received.It takes great pictures and puts them right on a floppy disk which means there is no messing around with chips and downloading to the computer before seeing your pictures.  You can easily erase and edit your pictures and publish them on the internet.  My family loves having the pictures sent to them and they are good enough quality to print out on photographic paper.  The pictures are of great quality and the camera is very easy to use and understand.<br><br>
