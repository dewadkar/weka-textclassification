            We, my husband and I, bought this particular vehicle for several reasons.  Number one: We needed a four wheel drive vehicle because of our winter weather.  Number two: We needed a vehicle I could get in and out of easily because I suffer from Parkinson's Disease.  Number three: We needed a roomy vehicle so that we could travel comfortably on our trips from Missouri to Louisiana to see our kids.  Number four: We needed the room, not only the two of us, but so my mother-in-law and father-in-law would ride comfortably when we bring them up here to visit for a few weeks each year.

I love the looks of the Chevy Suburban! Ours is Emerald Green and has a rack on top and is so sleek looking. 

I also love the way it drives and the way I can see out of it easily.  It is similar to a van in that respect.  I also like the feeling of safety in a larger vehicle, especially when traveling.  

I love all the fancy equipment that came with it, like the temp gauge and the compass direction, along with the great sounding radio, etc. And I've already appreciated the heating system, which has worked well in our usual cold weather.  I'm sure the A/C works just as well.

The only thing I could possibly hate would be the cost of filling the gas tank because it holds 40 gallons and that would be around $60.00 at today's gas prices.  

But the Chevrolet Suburban isn't our only vehicle.  So, we drive a smaller pickup for everyday things or when it isn't snowing and save the Suburban for special or bad weather trips.  We did the same thing with the Cadillac Sedan Deville, which we owned for 13 years.  In fact we traded it in on this suburban and got an extra $500.00 rebate because we had bought the Cadillac new and kept it so long.

People who can't afford the gas for this vehicle shouldn't buy it or if you prefer a small vehicle you might feel like you were driving an 18 wheeler.  

For those of you who can afford the vehicle and the gas I say GO FOR IT!!!<br><br>
