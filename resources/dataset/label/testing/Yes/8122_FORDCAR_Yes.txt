            I will start off by saying that I have had my Black Explorer Sport for about 2 years now and I love it. I will admit that my brother owns a Ford Dealership up here in Vancouver. The truck is very responsive and has smooth pickup for a SUV. It handles quite tight on the road and in the snow up at Whistler it is very good There is a definite feeling of control when in rainy, snowy or icy weather. The one negative would probably be space in the rear seats and back trunk; therefore, it would be tough to strap your kid in the baby seat in the rear seats. Overall, I enjoy the truck a lot.<br><br>
