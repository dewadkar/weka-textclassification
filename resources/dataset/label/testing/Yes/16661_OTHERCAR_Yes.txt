            We just traded our 2001 Jeep Cherokee Limited for a van, needing space for our growing family.  This was the second new Cherokee we owned and parting with it was not easy.  We owned this vehicle for about 1 1/2 years, covering 18,000 miles, so this review is based on quite a bit of personal experience.  As you may already know, Jeep dropped the Cherokee line and introduced the Jeep Liberty as its smaller four-door SUV.

EQUIPMENT AS REVIEWED:

2001 Jeep Cherokee Limited 4DR
4WD
Steel Blue paint
4.0L inline 6 cylinder engine with automatic transmission

EXTERIOR:

The exterior of Jeep Cherokees did not change much for almost two decades.  It has a timeless appearance that never seems to go out of style.  Both Cherokees that we owned, including the one reviewed here, had some issues with fit and finish.  A close inspection of the exterior revealed that doors were not properly aligned, causing the front door to rub against the rear door during opening and closing.  This caused a small area of paint to wear off.  Looking at the gaps between body panels and doors revealed differences.  I also found a small area of surface rust that was painted over on the roof.

The rear hatch opens high enough so that you will not hit your head on it when it is opened and closes with little effort.  The rear glass is fixed and cannot be opened like with some other SUVs.

The roof rack is function and durable.  Aluminum wheels are optional and were attractive.

INTERIOR:

The instrument panel is well laid out and easily readable.  All interior buttons and switches are backlit to make them easy to find in the dark.  Our Cherokee's power window controls were not lit on the driver's door, but this was quickly corrected with a service visit.

The floor console provided a storage compartment (non-locking) and two cup-holders.  There is one average sized glove compartment also.

Air conditioning is more than adequate and even on the hottest days the setting of "2" (of 4) is more than enough to keep the car cool once it has been cooled off.  Heat and air vents for the rear passengers were small and it takes extra time for the back seat passengers to get comfortable.

The overhead console (optional) is very functional.  It contains a trip computer along with a compass and exterior temperature.  It also has a place to store sunglasses, map lights and garage door opener holder.  The garage door opener is not a Homelink system, but simply a place to velcro your garage door remote so that it is covered by a door and the door presses against the remote when used.

Our had a rear wiper, washer and defroster which are almost a necessity.

The front seats are comfortable, but the rear seats have limited legroom.

The rear cargo area is very spacious and included tie-down hooks to secure loose items.  The rear seats fold down if additional space is needed.  Spare tires are mounted in the cargo area and eat some space, especially if you get the full-size spare (optional).  The jack and tire tools are stored under the rear passenger seat.

PERFORMANCE:

The 4.0L inline 6 cylinder engine produced 195 HP and was very responsive and trouble-free.  The transmission shifted smoothly and is operated with a floor shifter.  The four-wheel drive system is very manual.  With the exception of not having to get out and lock the wheels, it is as manual as they come.  There is no engaging "on the fly" - you have to shift to neutral or park to engage 4WD.  Having said that, it is also very durable and effective.  Jeeps are known for their 4WD performance and the Cherokee is no exception.  While I never took ours off-road, I did have occasion to use it several times in heavy snow and it performed flawlessly.

We did have two complaints with the powertrain.  Compared to our 1998 Cherokee, the 2001 had a loud bass resonance at idle that was very annoying.  Additionally, it seemed to lack power at highway speeds.  Even when driving on hilly interstate roads, the Cherokee would sometimes need to downshift to make it up the hill.  I brought these concerns to our dealer's service department but was told that they were characteristic to the vehicle and not defects.

The ride is firm so bumps are very noticeable.  Cherokees seem to be more akin to Wranglers than Grand Cherokees so you will not find a soft-cushy ride in a Cherokee.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:

Overall, we loved our Cherokees and hated to part with this one, knowing that they would not be manufactured anymore.  They were priced right when new, compared to other SUVs and were very dependable.  While their styling did not change for many years, it did not get outdated either.

We simply outgrew ours and needed a bigger vehicle.  I was glad to see that Jeep's new SUV (Liberty) took a different name, as Jeep allowed itself the opportunity to reintroduce the Cherokee in the future if the market supports it.
