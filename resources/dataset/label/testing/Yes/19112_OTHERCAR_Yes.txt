            I bought a 2001 Monte Carlo SS about 3 weeks ago.  I also have a 1996 Monte Carlo Z34 so I know from personal experience that Chevy has put much more thought into this newer generation Monte Carlo than in the last.  It has a lot of options that you would expect to find on a much more expensive car -heated mirrors, overhead console, electrochromic rear view mirror, standard OnStar, etc.  I have yet to find anything I do not like about it and I love to drive it.  If you like to have a sporty-looking car on the outside but still want comfortable on the inside, I would highly recommend this car, it's a head-turner.  I'll post it if my opinion changes in any way.

Update: 3/31/01-so far so good with almost 7,000 miles on it.  There have only been a few issues we've discovered that are a little annoying, but wouldn't have changed our choice.  My husband gets frustrated when he gets in until he leans the seat back (a little short on head-room).  The passenger seat (not power) slides forward when it's raised forward for someone to get in the back, this is just a little annoying.  I've only had one mechanical problem, a bad foglight bulb, dealership replaced it a few months ago and it's been fine since.  The 3.8 is proving to be a much smoother engine the the 3.4 DOHC in my '96.  I am glad I gave the Monte a second chance after the ordeal with my '96 Z34, this one is proving to be a much better car.
