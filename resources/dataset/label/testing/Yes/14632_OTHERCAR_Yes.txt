                The only car anyone would want to be found dead in.....but would rather be alive to enjoy. Chrysler nows how to make beautiful cars and the 300M is just another masterpiece. The engine is quite and power, the interior is exquisite and roomy, and the over all performance is outstanding. This luxury car will, or already has set a standard for the new millenium. Seeing this car float along on the road makes me drool with such envy.
    I have spent the past 4 days going to the Chrysler dealership looking for a new vehicle because my old chrysler is about to go. on the last day, lookin around for almost an hour with no help from a dealer(maybe because im only 19, and look it) i went to recruit one to help me find a car that i would like. After another hour of the touring the lot, i came across the 300M. It looked just like a diamond surround by coal. Even though the car was a dark hugh. it just screamed luxury at its best. After being told details about the car, i wanted to feel how it drove. So the Dealer and i went for a test drive.
    The drive was incredible. Turning on the engine just felt like turning a key in a door, the engine purred like a sleeping lion. I hit the gas a little to hard when we left the parking lot, but the car responded with ease. I actually felt like i was on a soft pillow made out of leather crusing down the street at 55. Everything about this car was amazing. Top class brake system. 4 doors, gotta have the 4 doors. It was roomy, a hippo definulty could fit inside. the suspension gave with ever bump so i didnt feel the road, or the occasion pothole at all. After a 30 minute drive the dealer felt it was time to go home and close the deal. what he didnt know was that i was already bought. This car, The 300M, was perfect. 
   i didnt see anything wrong at all. but i had 2 things left to check before i wanted to go back. so i asked ray( the dealer) if i could see how the audio system in the car sounded. He just smiled and cranked it up. I was astonished, it sounded better then my car did and i put a $2k sound system in it. i couldnt believe my ears at all. after the song ended he turned down the radio, and i asked for one last thing. "can i check the 0-60 on this baby?"
 I pulled up to a stop sign and waited my turn. Then i mashed the petal to the floor. My head literally almost fell off my shoulder with how fast that 300M got to 60. i really didnt check the secs, but im guessing around 7 or 8. now thats fast.
  i have only one bad thing to say about all of this. After gettin back to the dealership. we went to finalize the deal. Me with 10k in my pocket and high hopes. After about 45 minutes he came back and said i wasnt approved for the rest of the money because of my age and no co signer. I was devistated. So after the whole ordeal of falling in love i had to wait and save up more cash. But believe me, that car will be mine, and yours because you deserve to treat yourself to such a fine automobile.
