            I recently had a chance to take pictures with this digital camera.  My sister was in town and I haven't seen her for about 6 months.  She is into picture taking and brought along with her the Nikon Coolpix 800.  When she told me she paid hundreds for it, I was like WOW.  She replied with a laugh and said the camera was wonderful and it was of quality price and value.  I then was interested and started taking some pictures of my own with it.  I have never used a digital camera before but it was easy to use.  It's not the most attractive camera in the world but it's light in weight which is good.  The camera takes 4 double AA batteries.

The menu for the camera is clear and easy to use.  Switching between modes is simple.  I used the full proof automatic mode while taking most of my pictures with the Nikon Coolpix 800.  I took over 50 different PICS with the camera over the course of a week.  She followed me through some of the settings.  You can manually set the field of depth for the photo.  Deleting unwanted photos is also something I found great with having a digital camera.  You can save around 200 photos with this camera and delete the ones you don't want or simply save the ones you like by downloading them into your computer and print them out.

The photo quality of the pictures are great.  I downloaded the photo's into my computer and printed out some 8x10 on my Cannon printer.  The maximum resolution photos show great detail and look amazing.  I have seen some pictures of my sisters old digital camera as compared to this one.  The Nikon Coolpix 800 picture quality was way better then the other camera.  I took some pictures inside my house and outside.  I noticed that the picture quality stayed same regardless of the lighting.

In conclusion, from my understanding this is a very good camera for its price.  It's easy to use and takes great pictures at high quality.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to buy a digital camera.  My sister is in love with it and after using it myself, I now know that if your looking for a camera you should buy a digital.  Nikon Coolpix 800 is a guilty easy to use camera at a quality price<br><br>
