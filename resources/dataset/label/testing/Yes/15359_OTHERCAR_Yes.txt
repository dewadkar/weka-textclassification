            The Sony Mavica MVC-FD83, when I first saw the Mavica line, I thought it was a strange concept, a camera with a floppy disk for film.  I never thought it would go over well, I just couldn't see a use for it.  Then along came the days of the Internet, everyone wanting a picture, be it online chat rooms or pictures of items you wish to sell online.  Now this camera is starting to make sense, you can take pictures, remove the disk, and put the disk in anyone's computer to upload pictures to the web, edit them, print them out, Oh the possibilities.  You don't need any special cables, you don't need any special programs to see the pictures on a computer, and a floppy drive is pretty standard equipment on most computers, no problems, unless you own a Macintosh.  For this ease of transferability though, you do have to give up one thing, the number of pictures you can take.  Since it only uses a standard floppy disk, at medium resolution, it will only store 5-6 pictures on the disk.  Using the low quality 640X480, you can store more pictures per disk, but because of the low resolution the picture will be grainy, so its best to use the medium resolution of the camera.  Overall this is nice camera, you don't have to worry if there is no USB port on your computer, You don't have to be concerned about special cables, just drop in the disk, and controls on it are easy to understand, without even reading the manual, I knew how to use all of its settings in under 10 minutes.  I would recommend this camera to anyone, just remember to bring some floppies along with you.<br><br>
