            I leased a 1996 BMW 328is manual, deep metallic blue with tan interior, sport kit, alarm, trip computer, and CD player.

Great car and I enjoyed while I had it.  This was my first car out of college and my first manual shifting car.  Manual is the only way to go for a sporty car and I will always own sporty cars with a manual.  I've since had a 1983 Porsche 911sc Cabriolet 5-speed (replaced the BMW, sold seven or eight months later), 1987 Ferrari 328GTS 5-speed (still have, 3 years coming up and non end in sight), and a 2001 Mercedes C-240 6 speed (just got).

The '96 328is was easily the best car available in my price range at the time.  It was a wonderful rear wheel drive car with a really nice level of fit and finish.   

Some silly things I remember that created a really good impression:

BMW Car Club of America - awesome monthly magazine (Roundel) - still a member just to get this!  Great people in the local club - good driver's education events.

Frameless doors with auto lowering windows made for a good fit each time you closed it.  

Great cup holders - there were two with one that was adjustable by removing a ring shaped spacer - so it gripped a 12 oz soda PERFECTLY and with the ring removed you could handle a super size McDonalds cup.  Silly, but true.  ;-)

Trip computer could be hacked and it would tell you to the accuracy of .1 gallons what was left in the tank.

Full size spare.

One touch open, but not close on the sun roof.  One touch up/down on both windows of the coupe.

No memory positions for the seats in the 3 series for that model year. 

Grill slats inside the kidney grill are black, not body color - I think it looks better this way.

When the door is locked and you're inside you pull the handle once and it's unlocked, a second time and it opens.  I liked this a lot.

Reddish orange for the dashboard, radio, and trip computer display was really easy on the eyes at night.

Ah well.  I think this car was an exceptional value at the time and I still prefer the lines of the E36 1996 3 series body over any of the 3 series BMW bodies since then.
