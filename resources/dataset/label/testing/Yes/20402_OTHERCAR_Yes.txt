            I imported a 2001 VW Golf TDi 4Motion to the UK from Germany as my Audi gave up the ghost due to a cracked cylinder head. Sceptical at first that it was too small I soon realised that there was ample room for me and my sports kit.

The model I have is the GT TDi 130 bhp with 4 wheel drive and a 1.9 l diesel engine. It is incredibly gutsy and is capable of 130 mph if necessary, while returning over 40 mpg during normal driving. I have 2 sets of wheels, one with winter tyres which have now negated the need for chains in poor conditions. The 4 wheel drive is on demand and makes the car extremely sure-footed in all conditions. There is an Electronic Stability Programme (ESP), and this can be turned off but doesn't need to be, which adjusts the drive to the wheels that need it most.

The strong engine is quiet and refined but the basic model is quite stark. I have got Recaro Colour Concept leather seats in Black and Yellow with heating, a winter pack with instant de-mist, auto wipers, xenon lights, climate control and cruise control. There is also a satnav system that is run by CD-ROM and is extremely capable.

In short the Golf TDi 4Motion is a vast amount of car for reasonable money. It needs to have as many extras as possible to refine it, but it soon becomes a luxury car in an economy car's clothing. Superb!
