            I bought this camera on a web auction in May 1999 after much research
of many brands of digital cameras.  I got a very good price - more than
$200 less than MSRP.  The thing that sold me on the Sony digital
cameras was the fact that they use floppy disks to store the pictures.
This has turned out to be more than correct thinking.  I am limited
only by the number of floppies that I have with me.  The camera will
also copy an entire floppy disk, so I can make immediate copies of
my pictures for my friends without having to have a PC nearby.  Also,
no cables are needed to connect to your PC - just insert the floppy.
The battery that comes with it is an InfoLithium, which can be charged
at any time with no memory effect.  It also lasts for a couple hundred
photos between charges.  I bought another battery for it that lasts even
longer (NP-F550).
This camera takes very good photos.  Optical zoom is 3X. Many exposure
and photo effects are available through an easy to use menu system.  I
take most of my photos at 1024x768, which is nice.  This setting will
get you about 14 pictures per floppy.  Lower resolutions will put up to
30 photos per disk.  Each photo can include 5 seconds of sound, so you
can annotate them.  It will also do a 1-3 minute MPEG movie per floppy.
I liked this camera so much that I bought another one for the office.<br><br>
