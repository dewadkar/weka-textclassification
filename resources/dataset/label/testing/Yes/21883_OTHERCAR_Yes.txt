            After driving a vast array of cars we decided to purchase(my wife's car) a 2000 BMW 528i Sportwagon with an automatic transmission and the Sport-Premium package. This car would replace a VW Passat VR6 Wagon that had performed admirably and without a single problem. She wanted a luxury car that could still handle our two dogs(retrievers), and for this we needed another wagon. I did a lot of test drives and research leading up to the purchase and after 5 months of ownership we feel incredibly satisfied with our decision. 

Here are some of the other cars we considered:

Mercedes E 320 Wagon: Our 2nd choice. Pros: Smooth ride, very nice fit and finish, excellent motor, extremely spacious in wagon form. Cons: Reserved styling(my wife liked everything else, but hated the styling), not as sporting as the BMW.

Audi A6/A6 Allroad Wagon: Our 3rd choice. Pros: A fine car with a great 2.7T engine, spacious interior, versatile with 4 wheel drive and Allroad clearance. Cons: Steering wasn't as good as BMW or Mercedes, Neither was the handling(especially compared to the BMW) Although the interior is beautiful it just didn't give off the same aura of ultra high end luxury as the BMW and Mercedes.

Volvo V70 XC Wagon: Pros: Powerful engine, spacious, sharp new exterior styling. Cons: Miserable ride and handling(floaty and loose), Steering not so good, not the same level of refinement or luxury as the BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Not even close to the three German cars overall.

Saab 9-5 SE Wagon: Pros: Excellent ride and good handling, nice power, nice styling and overall design. Cons: A big step down in luxury and fit and finish, no storage spots in cabin, a hefty price tag when compared to what the BMW, Mercedes, and Audi deliver.

BMW 740i/il: We considered this car until we decided we had to have a wagon Pros: 8 cyl. power, big car that doesn't feel that big at speed, very spacious interior. Cons: Doesn't come in wagon form, Doesn't feel as easy to command(ex: getting in/out of parking spots)as the 5 series.



I love wagons. They are so versatile. With the seats folded down you can haul most things, and if you have dogs they really pay off. Getting a wagon that looks this good and sacrifices almost nothing in handling and sportiness to the sedan is remarkable.

This car is whisper quiet, which is immensely relaxing. The automatic transmission shifts so smooth you barely notice the shift. The steptronic shifting feature is excellent for mountain driving(we live in Utah)and really works well. Its 2.8L engine provides a very good(for excellent check out the 540i) amount of very smooth power and excellent fuel economy(23.5 mpg in mixed driving). The ride is tight(sport version) yet very smooth and compliant. The braking is superb.

The wood and leather lined interior is well laid out and a extremely relaxing environment. Its design is almost flawless and ALMOST everything works to perfection(see Cons). The xenon headlights really light up the road and the brights are nothing short of stunning. The cruise control with steering wheel controls works better than any other I've tried. The dash lighting is impressive and you feel like you are flying a jet. The Sport package steering wheel is too cool. Seats are comfortable and supportive but beware of the sport package seats if you are a big person since they are pretty narrow in the back/lumbar area. Interior space is good with good leg room and pretty good rear seats as long as you and your passengers are not from the NBA. Cargo area in the wagon is very good and the rear seats fold down completely flat without having to remove the headrest. 

I have to disagree with some others about the sound system. I am a audio enthusiast and have spent a great deal of time and money on my home stereo/theater setup. I know good sound when I hear it! The quality of the upgraded DSP stereo is quite good. Don't expect it to shake the car with bass or remain clean at very high volumes like an expensive aftermarket setup, but if you want quality sound at reasonable volumes it definitely is one of the best(if not the best)stock systems that I have heard.

Overall, this is a great car that is worth every penny. My wife absolutely loves driving it(she drives 20,000+ miles/year). She drives 60% highway/40% city and she says that it makes her job(sales and marketing) so much more pleasant being able to spend time in such a nice car(she says it is the ultimate stress reliever). And when I drive it I am always amazed at how it can transform itself from a sheep to a wolf so effortlessly. Who needs a sports car when you have a BMW wagon??!!<br><br>
