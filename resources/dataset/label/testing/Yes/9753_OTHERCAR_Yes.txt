            Let me start off by saying that this camera is definitely worth every penny you spend.

There are an abudance of features present in the Coolpix 2500. For example, the movie mode, multiple scene selections, swivel lens and optical zoom separate this 2 megapixel camera from its competitors.

The 15 second movie mode is amazing. I have taken so many movies with my camera and watch them over and over again on my computer. Sure, one can argue that the quality may not rival that of a regular video camera. Then again, if someone is going to a party at night or simply going over to their buddy's house for the evening, would they want to always carry their heavy video camera with them? The coolpix 2500 is light enough such that one can carry it wherever they go. 

The multiple scene selection allows one to choose from various pre-configured settings to optimize the quality of their pictures under certain lighting and environmental conditions. 

The swivel lens is obviously an added bonus. Not necessarily a 'feature' of the camera, but rather an element of design, the swivel lens provides the opportunity to take pictures with the camera at different angles. For example, I went to a party and wanted to take a picture of a couple people dancing from about seven feet off the ground. With the average camera, I would have had to simply hold the camera high in the air, not being able to simultaneously view the LCD screen while taking the picture. Yet, the Coolpix 2500 rises to the occassion and allows one to swivel the lens for maximum picture-taking efficiency.

The 3x optical zoom is a great benefit. Not found on most cameras of similar price, the optical zoom allows for undistorted close up shots. A 2x digital zoom also exists, but I would highly recommend ignoring the digital zoom when shopping as this feature is basically the same as taking the picture without zooming and then cropping out the desired portion using photo-editing software.

As for the negative points, the red eye is sometimes a problem. Photo-editing software can be used to rectify this issue. Overall, the camera generates very pleasing pictures.

Also, note that the LCD drains a lot of battery, so be careful not to constantly view the pictures in the screen.

Summing up, this camera truly is an innovative and useful gadget. I would highly recommend purchasing this camera, because it definitey provides the greatest bang for the buck.
