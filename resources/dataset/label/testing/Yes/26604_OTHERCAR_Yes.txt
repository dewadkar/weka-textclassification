            I previously wrecked my car before I went out looking for another which I just so happened to find the love of my life. I bought a used 1988 New Yorker Landau Mark Cross edition. The interior is all wood grain, leather and the seats are wonderful. The car has an awesome sound system that after eleven years can still make people smile. I have 113,000 miles on her and I feel like she could do 113,00 more.She does stall in wet weather , but thatï¿½s no big deal. I feel very safe in this car and I recommend it to everyone. I love driven her on long trips and the engine
does have alotta pep if you treat it right. This car is probably gonna out live me and i can give her to my kids. I also love the computer screen on the top center that gives you alot of necessary
information that you wouldn't expect out of such an old car but she always tends to surprise people. She looks so nice that no one believes her age. I love this car!!!!!<br><br>
