            My new vehicle, a 1994 Acura Vigor, is a pristine beauty I bought because of what I read on Epinions.  Sure, the car had to be in good condition, the price had to be right, and the seller had to be selling, but I flagged the car mentally because of the great reviews I'd read here on the site.  The vehicle was unanimously rated 'great' on this site.  I couldn't be more pleased, with the car or with you Epinions folk.

When I looked elsewhere on the web, I found there were sites dedicated entirely to Vigor owners who spoke (typed) at length about the virtues of their vehicle.  Ok, so I don't plan to go that far, but it does tell me there is quality of construction and pride of ownership, something I doubt I'd find with a Ford Explorer these days or even a Toyota Tundra.  

Why? Because the Vigor is no longer in production.  It was discontinued in 1994.  Furthermore, because they have so few problems, owners tend to drive them to the ground either because they are so dependable or because they want to save them as their Sunday vehicle.  Lastly, the style has stood the test of time--it is still a sharp-looking vehicle. The only reason I got one was the owner had to find something a bit easier for her elderly mother to get into--the seating is a bit low.

<b>Design</b>
This design is classic now.  Sort of a sharper, sleeker design than that of the Legend, BMW has copied it recently in its 740 vehicle. I always appreciate those designs that stand the test of time, like this one and that of the old Saab 900 series.

<b>Performance</b>
This 5-cylinder in-line engine really cooks.  I find it hard to believe it's only 176 horsepower, but that's fine with me.  I'm thrilled with the power.  The suspension is soft like the Legend, and the design serves the vehicle well in cornering and control.  As you get a feel for the timing of the automatic transmission, you can really maximize acceleration.

<b>Details</b>
These are the small things that add up to make a big difference.  While we pretend these don't really matter, they really do add up to make what is a luxury car that is Acura. In this case, the details are very good, with only a few complaints. 

<i>Control Display</i>
The speedometer and tachometer displays are large and very visible, which I appreciate.  These are classic Honda displays in white with the lighting controls in green.  Warning lights are visible yet not overbearing.  Put on your seatbelt or you'll get an annoying light to remind you until you do (don't complain about this, it's the law in most places now).

<i>Heating and Cooling</i>
The heating controls are simple and straightforward, well placed in easy reach of the driver above the stereo at just below shoulder height.  The fan control has great integrated action from left to right, as does the heat control.  I've been very pleased with both the heat output and the air conditioning.  I'm told the coolant for the air is rare now, and will cost a few hundred dollars to replace--not a big deal for me, but something to note.

<i>Windows</i>
This vehicle has noticeably no trim around the window sills.  That is to say that if you lower the windows, you can open the door and get out without any frame impeding your step.  This is a great design feature that makes the Vigor unique among the Acura line.  They've done a good job sealing the windows because of this, as poor seals will whistle at high speeds.  I ran at 85 with near silence in this vehicle.

The rear windows open at a strange angle, presenting a sort of triangle piece when a full down position.  Some people have asked me about that, but it appears to be the norm.  My children appreciate that the windows are low enough for them to peer out when we head out on a road trip.

<i>Radio</i>
The radio was apparently some fancy shmancy thing when it came out, now it is just a darn good sounding thing.  There are speakers in front, back, and on both sides of the light by your head.  The system leans a bit too much toward low bass and high treble, but I've adjusted that to really appreciate the rich bass you get from it.  The factor CD-player is adequate, although to switch to radio you have to 'pause' the cd.  The radio has 12 presets facilitated by a 2nd function key.  All in all, I've been very happy with the radio.

<i>Seats</i>
The leather seats in the GS are very comfortable.  The driver seat has a electronic controls forward, back, up, and down.  The passenger seat has manual controls.  The leather is good quality, with a shared armrest

<i>Visors</i>
The sun visors are stable with good action.  I appreciate the mini-visor above the rearview mirror, as this is usually one spot where the sun peers in when you least expect it.

<i>Cruise Control</i>
Great.  Smooth acceleration and deceleration, easy access via right thumb on the steering wheel.  No complaints.

<i>Steering Wheel</i>
Soft black leather of size slightly smaller than most, which makes gripping it quite nice.  The adjustment runs low, pressing it down toward your lap.  I use it in the upmost position.

<i>Glove Compartment</i>
Deficient in space and a bit difficult to access because of the dash position.  The compartment leans down a bit and isn't quite as wide as I'd like.  There are a few nice sleeves inside for placing registration and insurance cards or what have you.

<i>Trunk</i>
The great hidden bonus of the vehicle.  The trunk is huge.  I fit three tires on rims easily in the trunk when I purchased the vehicle.  You can easily put a set of golf clubs, a workout bag and a briefcase in the trunk.  The spare fits down under the inside cover for easy access.  A lockable latch allows both trunk and gas access.

<i>Room</i>
This is the biggest issue with this vehicle.  I'm 6 foot, and fit just about right in either front seat.  Anyone taller will have issues with legroom and headroom.  My children fit fine in the back seats, but larger passengers will have problems.  The back seats are comfortable, but legroom is very limited.

<i>Paint</i>
They did a great job with the paint.  My vehicle is a teal green color with no chips, rust or fading.  I'm very impressed.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I'm happy to say I'm satisfied with the purchase I made in large part because of the tips I received here on Epinions.  The vehicle has a classy, conservative styling combined with a solid sporty package.  I'll be driving this vehicle happily for at least another 5 years, knock on wood.
