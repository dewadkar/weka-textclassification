            I decided to treat myself to a convertible this year. I have turned up my nose at &quot;American&quot; cars for years now, preferring Volvos and Saabs. I looked long and hard for the perfect convertible and assumed it would be the Saab. At the last moment, I found the Saab to be too small, too spartan and too expensive. I went to a Chrysler dealer in a state of depression and had an unexpectedly good experience. A properly equipped and priced Sebring JXI was materialized in minutes. I bought on impulse and went home to worry. The car is &quot;just&quot; a Chrysler and made in Mexico to boot. It's too flashy for me.

My surprise is that this is one of the best all around cars I have ever owned. After 20,000 + miles, I am still delighted. It has been virtually defect-free and relatively economic to own and run. Performance is great. The top is tight and the body is (still?) quiet, with few rattles and squeaks. The looks and lines have grown on me. I am a proud owner. My vacation and long-weekend habits reflect the fact that I love to drive the car.

The only minuses: I have rear-wheel drum brakes and I am underwhelmed with the stopping power. I should have been specific about disc brakes all around. And I am still not real comfortable with Chrysler service departments. Every time I go in for an oil change, they suggest unnecessary work. Stick to the service recommendations in the manual and you will be fine.

I confess that I wonder about the car's durability. Will it hold up in the years to come? I have no reason to think not. If I get three fun years out of it and can sell for a reasonable price, I will buy another.<br><br>
