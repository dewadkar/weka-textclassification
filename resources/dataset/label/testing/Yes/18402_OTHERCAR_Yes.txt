            My husband bought his 1992 MX-3 nearly four years ago. When I first saw it, I thought &quot;Holy Cow! What a small car. Definitely not meant for a family.&quot;

That statement could not be more true. However...during the summer of last year, my husband traveled 13 hours none stop twice a week to the mines just outside of Elko, Nevada. This little car got excellent gas mileage. He had to stop only once per trip to fill up. And this is with his average speed of approximately 75 mph.

What also should be mentioned is how durable the car is. If you live in Nevada near the mines then you know how terrible those back roads are. Every morning he would drive for an hour down one of the worst roads you could imagine. The twists and turns were no problem for the MX-3.

Of course he preferred to drive an ATV or truck, but since all we have is the MX-3 and a Mini-Van (and that was NOT an option for him) he had no choice but to drive the Mazda.

Even since his trip to the mines, the MX-3 has held up perfectly.
The car was taken in for a tune up and the only problem found was the muffler had been shaken loose. No leaks, no damage underneath, and even more surprising, no damage to the shocks (or struts. not certain which he said it has). And this car was more than put to the test. So if you are considering purchasing a small car for yourself or someone in the family, check out the Mazda MX-3 first. It is compact, but it is built to last.
