            I bought my 1992 Saturn SL before going off to college in the summer of 1992.  I chose the Saturn because it was a fairly good looking car that fit my budget.  The car is a marvel of engineering strength.

I delivered pizza to put myself through college in Starkville, Mississippi.  Over the course of three years I had been hit from behind twice by other motorists and had hit 5 deer head-on.  There were minor damages to repair from two of the deer (which were very inexpensive), but both rear-endings I received required no repairs.  One of the rear-endings totaled the car that struck me, but left only a minor scratch visible on my bumper.

The metal under the bumper bends, but the shell maintains its original shape - it is amazing.  It is a great car for congested traffic areas where minor bumps are common.

The only beefs with the car are that 1)the interior tends to fall apart where it is snapped together after the 100,000 mile mark.  This is inexpensive to repair, but it can be a headache.  And 2) The alternator must be replaced, it cannot be rebuilt.  

I recommend this car as the perfect car for a college-bound student.  <br><br>
