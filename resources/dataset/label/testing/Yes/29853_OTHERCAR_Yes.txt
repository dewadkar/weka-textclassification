            I seriously considered the Acura TSX when I went shopping for a car. I wanted something not too big (like the current model Accords, Altimas and Camrys), was sporty and, most importantly, had a comfortable interior. 

The TSX is similar in size to the BMW 3-series, Benz C-class and Audi A4s with which it competes. The major difference is that you get a lot more for a much cheaper price compared to the German sedans. In Canada, the TSX goes for about $35K, before taxes, options and discounts. 

What you get standard (there are no significant options) is a 200hp front-wheel drive car that has all the luxury amenities like xenon headlights, leather seating surfaces, in-dash 6 CD changer and all the usual safety and convenience functions. With its competitors offering most of those features only as options and only offering AWD in more premium models the TSX easily outscores them in value. 

However, if you look a bit more closely you'll see where the family sedan roots of the TSX as it really an improved, upscale version of the European Accord sedan. The engine and improved suspension are capable but don't really provide that abundance of raw power some people may hope for. I was content with the power, it has enough to be sporty and that's all I wanted. I wasn't as pleased with the suspension; I've always felt Honda/Acura cars to have too stiff suspension set ups even though they do handle well and it's the same with the TSX. Other people prefer it, I didn't and I wasn't about to get something I didn't like for what I was going to spend. Overall, it doesn't drive like the German sport sedans... it's really more of a family sedan that drives and handles very well.

Another place the family sedan roots shows up is in the interior. While I really liked the design and flow of the interior the quality of the parts just wasn't very good. You only get a choice of two interior colours. With the black with silver trim interior it's easy to spot the silver trim is just spray-painted plastic. It looks amateurish almost. Even more annoying is that they use that fake silver plastic trim as the shift gate too. Compare this with the aluminum shift gate that Audi offers and you just won't be happy with it (though you could get a manual transmission and not worry about it). Also, the black plastic isn't of much better quality. With the tan interior you get a much nicer wood trim but you still get a lot of the cheap black plastic. The interior, while nice from afar, just doesn't convey that luxury feeling upon closer inspection.

In the end I chose the Audi A4 with Quattro AWD. Why? I wanted a sense of luxury at this price and the TSX interior didn't cut it though FWD and its lower price was very compelling. Additionally the TSX offers Acura quality which you simply won't get with the German sedans. I feel that the TSX would've been the more practical choice but then sport and near luxury sedans have never been practical (get a Corolla instead). 

Good effort though for Acura and it's nice to see more of a choice in cars of this range.
