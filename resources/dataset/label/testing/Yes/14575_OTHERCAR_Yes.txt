            My brother-in-law has this camera. It is awesome! I went to visit him this weekend and had a blast with it. I took lots of pictures with it.Then I took the best and sent them to family members. This camera is so much fun.And its so easy to use, a kid could. Hey if I could use , anybody can. The colors are so vivid. I thought it was like looking at the real thing. The pictures are so clear. There is no fuzziest,blurs or spots. I thought it would be really hard to put the pictures in the computer, but it wasnt. I was and still am amazed at it. I have already put the word in for my birthday! LOL I would highly recommend it!<br><br>
