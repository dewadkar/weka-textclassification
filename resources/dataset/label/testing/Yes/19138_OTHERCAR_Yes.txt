              My wife and I were all ready in love with our 1992 Mitsubishi Galant VR4. This car had been flawless mechanically and an unbelievable thrill to drive; BUT since starting a family and developed a passion for camping... (with two Beagles to boot), the 4-door Sports-sedan was no longer the correct choice of vehicles. Besides, the car was six years old and had a trunk the size of a swollen breadbox. Nuff Said.

  So off to the dealer for a Sports utility vehicle right?... (minivans were according to my wife...  &quot;yucky&quot; ... so why argue?) Upon arriving at the dealership we happened upon the little jewel in the middle of a sea of 1999 deliveries... A Midnight Black Passat GLS Wagon.. with several unusual options: A Black All-Leather interior with the All-Weather Package (heated mirrors, heated washer nozzles, and best of all up here in New England .. Heated front seats), as well as the luxury package which consists of the power moon-roof and dealer installed Rondo Wheel Package shod with Goodyear Eagles. 

  The Passat shares its chassis with its smaller stable-mate Jetta as well as with the AUDI A4 and A6.. each of which also offers a wagon model dubbed the Avant. The car falls between the two in the size department and offers All-Wheel Drive as an option as opposed to AUDI's standard Viscuous-Coupling system.

  Now keep in mind I had just left a car with every option, All-Wheel Drive, 4-Wheel Independent suspension, All-Wheel Steering, and 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. I was apt to be critical of the performance of a &quot;Station Wagon&quot;. However before even driving it I noted that the full spread of standard amenities abounded.. (power windows and locks with remote, A/C, FOUR airbags, four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, and a superb sound system) This particular car had the 1.8 liter turbo 20 valve engine with 150 horses. At the time the top-of-the-line V6 and Synchro drive wagon was not available for another 6 months. C'est la vie.. lets she what she can do... 

   Both my wife and I prefer a standard transmission but the Tiptronic Automatic is available for those who prefer to not clutch. The car is a surprisingly good performer.. whose best feature is its handling.. smooth responsive and a real pleasure during &quot;need-to-be-nimble&quot; city driving. I found the Bosch-engineered brakes to be exceptionally powerful and only a little bit on the touchy side.. continued driving allowed me to get more used to how much pedal pressure gave the desired result. I have repeatedly obtained 30 miles to the gallon on highway trips with the recommended Super Unleaded.. I have found the difference from the regular grade to higher octane gas is VERY apparent especially when leaving a stop light. And speaking of long trips, the seats are very comfortable and the only thing I would like to see on the car is a power seat package with a muti-user memory. The steering column and driver's seat adjusts nine ways from Sunday and it takes a bit of time to swap one drivers settings back to yours.. 

   Moving to the back.. the cargo area is cavernous with TWO 12 volt electrical jacks in the back and a removable privacy shade to cover the back from prying eyes. The seats are 60/40 split so a car-seat on the skinny side allows plenty of room with the other seat half folded down for those odd shaped things you are bringing back from the campsite. With all this car has to offer, (including 2-years free maintenance under warranty) under the cargo mat is a real treat for a person who appreciates Older cars.... A FULL-SIZE spare tire. All I can say is it is about time we saw these seriously needed objects in the trunks of cars. And finally in the cargo area are two cubbies for stuff, with one particular cubby prewired for a VW/Blaupunkt six disc CD Changer which is controlled by the radio Head Unit.

   All-In-All this vehicle lends itself to almost any lifestyle  that WANTS some style.. the car is actually more attractive than its sibling Sedan, and has more headroom for the rear seats, drives like a BMW and hauls as much stuff as a small SUV.. but get gas mileage like a compact; all with a sharp crisp look that can drive up to a New York Valet with a smirk. Of course don't forget to turn back and look at it as he drives off with it.. chances are he might have as much fun in his 5 minute jaunt as you did getting there...<br><br>
