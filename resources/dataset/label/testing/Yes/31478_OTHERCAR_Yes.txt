            This is my second digital camera. I first purchased an Olympus D-220 and was very pleased with it. However, as prices came down and resolution went up, I decided it was time for a higher resolution camera.

After intensive research, I purchased an Agfa 1280 and have been very pleased with its performance. The shapes are very clear and colors are accurate, for the most part. I say this because about half of the photos I have taken have been slightly yellowish. This, of course, depends on the lighting situation and whether the photo is taken inside or outside.

I have been able to produce 8&quot; x 10&quot; print quality with a combination of slight photo retouching in Adobe Photoshop and printing on my Epson 800. I have actually hung several prints from this camera in my home, and co-workers of mine cannot tell the difference between developed photos and those printed form my computer.

Controls on the camera are very easy to understand and operate. All controls, with the exception of zoom, are al located on the side of the camera and are operated through a single dial. Two modes, Record and Play on the dial take you to the mode you want, and by pressing the scroll button located above the dial, you can access all features in each mode. Using this scroll button, you then choose the feature you want and access the fine tuning aspects of that feature. Whether it's the self-timer, white point adjustment, flash settings, or whatever feature you choose, this camera offers even an experienced photographer a wide range of choices for getting just the right shot.

This is a great choice, whether you're looking for a beginning digital camera, or you have prior experience and are looking for a very reasonably priced camera with a ton of features. Either way, you can't go wrong.
