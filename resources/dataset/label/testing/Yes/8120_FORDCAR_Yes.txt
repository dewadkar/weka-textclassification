                I bought the 96 Ford Explorer Sports Utility Vehicle for my then
teenage daughter. I wanted a car that I thought would be safe, but fun for her to drive. I feel that I made the right choice. Not only was the car big enough for her, but it was comfortable and roomy. The back seats folded down so that if you needed more space to carry things that you could. I brought many items like bikes, televisions and computers home in her car. Also since she was involved in many sports, it was a good car for her to carry he sports gear and friends.
     The nice thing about this car were the luxury's. The electronic windows and electronic driver's seat. Also the electronic mirror's and
rear window windshield wiper blade. There are so many features on the car that I bought and liked them all. My absolute favorite  was the foot room in the back seats. You didn't feel like you were being stuff into the car. There was plenty of space to feel real comfortable.
     This so far has been the best car I have ever owned and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy.<br><br>
