            Where should I start?
I believe this is the best car I've ever purchased.  I say that because it has the most options for the least amount of money, and is quality-made.  The price I listed on this review includes all options and the transportation charge, and still is not bad!
The car handles like a dream.  From the moment I sat down, I felt like I was in a much more expensive car. The interior is roomy and comfortable, yet the seats and dash have the appeal of a sportier car.  What a perfect balance.  I test drove 2 (automatic and standard) on a curvy country road to see how it felt.  The car hugs the curves and is so easy to handle.  Once I drove these, there was no changing my mind.  I had already driven a Chevy Cavalier, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra while shopping.  Those were all great cars but none handled quite like this.  The Saturn felt like it was mine from the instant I started it up.  
I purchased a standard transmission because it was more fun, and turned out to be very easy to drive.  It has a lot of power.  The added security of the Saturn Alarm System is such a blessing; I could never have afforded one in another manufacturer's vehicle.  All of the control knobs and signal lights are placed in convenient locations and are easy to operate.  I have an SL2 model, which has very comfortable seating with lumbar support and height adjustments.  The CD player is wonderful and sounds great.  The details Saturn places in their vehicles makes it feel like the car is tailored to you.  I especially like the interior lights that come on when you unlock the car and slowly dim when you start the ignition.  It is so helpful.
The trunk has a glow-in-the-dark inside release handle, the first I've seen.  It also has a knob that disables the remote trunk release, which I use.  That was not found in some of the other new cars.  These little details are very pleasing.  
In addition, I was able to add a spoiler and alloy wheels, since Saturn's options are more affordable than others.  I tinted the windows and added deflectors after-market. Since then, I've been told by several that I have a "cool car".  And it's not even a coupe!  The car is just downright cute.
I researched all the cars I drove online first, and Saturn is very safe and gets great gas mileage.  I commute 46 miles one-way, and I can say it really does get 36-38 miles a gallon.  My insurance rates, as compared to the other vehicles, is $90-140 less per 6 months with the Saturn as well.
I cannot say enough, not just about the car, but my sales rep and the company itself, as well as the finance department.  I have never been treated with such utmost respect at a car dealership before.  The car, in my color and the options I wanted, was at a dealership in a neighboring state.  I was in no hurry, but my sales rep went on his day off to get it, and had the finance guy call me at work to surprise me and arrange to pick it up.  The car was in my driveway 2 days before I ever would have expected.  I was so pleased, in fact, that I sent my sales rep a thank-you car the day after my purchase, then I emailed Saturn about his superb service.  Saturn was quick and courteous in their response, and has awarded a Distinguished Service Certificate to him on my behalf.  
I sincerely hope that all Saturn customers are as pleased as I am.  
I've owned the car for several months now and find the service technicians to be the nicest anywhere.  Mind you, I've only been in for routine maintenance.
You should at least test drive one soon!
