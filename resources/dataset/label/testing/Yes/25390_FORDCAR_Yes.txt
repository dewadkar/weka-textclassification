            This is the second Taurus wagon we have owned.  The first one we drove until it had 198,000 miles on it.  Yes that's right, 198,000 miles!  The only thing we ever did that that car was put brakes on it.  It was still running good when we traded it in on ANOTHER Taurus wagon.

We have now been driving this one for a year. I love it!  You can fold down the back seats and put the kids' bikes in it.  You can put sport equipment in the back and still have 3 kids in the back seat.  

We will never buy another kind of car I don't think.  We have learned that the Taurus is reliable and safe.  My husband wouldn't think twice about letting me out in this new one at night or even in the old one late at night.  

The only thing I dislike about this car is parking it.  It is a bit big.  But with practice you can learn to park it right without hitting anything.

I would recommend anyone to buy one.  They are perfect for families or for just couples.
