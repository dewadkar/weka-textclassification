When Ford decided to enter the small SUV market, they hit it dead on with the Escape. The 2001 Escape comes standard with a CD player which is really nice, however the standard 4-cylinder engine has much to be desired (so I hear).


Here's what I got:
Escape XLT 4WD
v6 engine
moonroof, 
tinted windows, 
Mach audio system,
side step bars
leather interior.

... everything except the side impact air bags.

So...my opinion.....GREAT! I love it. It was certainly worth the 4 month wait. The Escape has pick-up like a sports car, handles fantastic in the snow, and is comfortable for the passengers too. The heat comes on quickly when it's cold out, and the instrument panel is very stylish, as is the exterior. The Escape corners like a car, and almost ASKS you to put the pedal to the metal!

The interior is very comfortable, although I think Ford should replace the manual driver's lumbar support with an electric control. Also, I'd like a seat heater. Ok, I am a big baby, I know!


Here are the not-so-good things I have observed:

The sun shades are pretty useless, especially when you try to block the sun entering through the side window....you might as well put some sun tan lotion on.

The gear shift is mounted on the steering column. The problem with this is that the shifter gets in the way of switching the radio stations...can you say "accident waiting to happen?"

The front wheels seem to get dirty every week from excessive brake dust. 

The GAS MILEAGE!!! They say 18-24. Uh-uh. How about 15MPG. I get about 250 miles per tank of gas. 

So, when it comes down to it, the 2001 Escape is a kick-butt small SUV, and I would definitely consider leasing another one in 2 years. Most of the problems I have observed are easily overlooked when you are enjoying the rest of the ride, except maybe the MPG. 

Overall, I am very happy with my Escape

(P.S. I just found a website talking about the 2003 Escape HEV, the hybrid gas/electric model. Go to www.escapehev.com )



UPDATE (3/30/01)!!!!!

The New England area was hit by some serious snow storms and I would like to say that my Escape weathered them better than I ever would have imagined. We had FEET of snow and the Escape drove right through it! In fact, I ended up pulling several cars, pickup trucks and vans out of the snow! It was so funny. People were like "you are going to pull my car/truck/whatever with THAT?!!?" And they watched in amazement as I rescued them! Hurray!!
