                 Almost all SUV's these days are so expensive, and worst of all luxurious!! Maybe that is what you are looking for, but not me a High School student at Indian Hill where the roads get rough and the snow often hits i feel like i am invincible. As a teen i know for a fact that the car is very exciting to drive on and off road, and i know that wherever i am safe in my 4x4. 
     Don't tell my mother, but i love to off road every where and i just can not get stuck i added a nice 4 inch lift and new tires and the car looks sweet..and not just sweet but tough! Not only is this car excellent for teens and college students but Jeeps market hits the family too. With a descent amount of room the car provides a simple look and interior design which helps cut down costs from other competing SUV's 
     This Car in my opinion is a great car for a young person to start driving because of the good handling, looks, and price.
