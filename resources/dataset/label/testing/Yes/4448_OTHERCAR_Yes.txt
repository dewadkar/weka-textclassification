            I bought mine in July 96, only 4 colors are available in Canada, so I choose black. I bought it because it looks different than any other import, there are too many Integra already. Besides looks, the car also easily modified, since most performance parts are the same as Honda Accord, which use the same F22B1 engine. Customizing is very important, especially for a 22 year old, individualism is the key. I love its handling, ride quality and the good gas mileage. With a minor modification, my CL average 650km city/700km highway on a tank of gas. The car is fun enough for a short burst of speed when the coffee kicks in and comfortable enough for me to drive from Vancouver, Canada to Seattle, Washington once a week. After 4 years, only minor quality problems, such as rattling passenger seat, noisy fan, a factory recall on some front suspension parts ( Not all CL ), several burned bulbs. It also feels stronger than other imports. Mine only suffered a broken headlight and bumper light after hitting a Suburban which cost the big truck a new front door. At first, Acura targeted the CL for empty nesters, but in reality, there are many 18-25 year old who bought a CL. So if you want luxury without the high maintenance cost, this is the car. <br><br>
