            I currently own a 92 Camry Automatic with a four cylinder engine; bought it in 1998 and have owned for a year now.  It 90,000 miles on it, and I have put another 40,000.  The handling is descent, not as good as the smaller Toyotas.  It accelerates poorly.  It doesn't have anti-lock brakes, but the car decelerates very well.  The car seems to have electrical problems, for example: the lights have been replaced twice, as well as the interior light, and I have had to replace both rear signal lights.  I even had to replace the battery and air conditioning.  I don't know if this a problem with the model, or my individual car.  The spare tire is terrible, and the jack is worse.  I replaced the jack with a hydraulic jack and am about to buy a full size spare.  My car receives considerable abuse, driving in heavy traffic constantly and in very hot weather.  The car has never come close to overheating.  The mileage is excellent, and the engine is easy to work with.<br><br>
