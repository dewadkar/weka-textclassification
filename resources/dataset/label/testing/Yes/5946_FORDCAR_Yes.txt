            SUV's are what they are.  I chuckle at people who write that the Ford Expedition is too big, too bulky and rides too rough.  It's what an SUV is "supposed" to be.  All these things.  If you want to take the scenic tour through the nice paved roads of Martha's Vineyard, there are probably better options than the Ford Expedition.  If you like to haul just about anything under 5000lbs, have people move out of your way to merge onto a highway and do it rather swiftly, this SUV might be a good choice for you.

I leased my Ford Expedition brand new.  It retailed for around $38k and I am buried in my lease for 4 years.  I don't think I would lease again because as much as I enjoy this truck, I don't think I see me driving up to 70,000 miles.  

What is good about the 2001 Ford Expedition are all the things I mentioned in power, performance and dependability.  The little things I like about it are the nice, big leather captain chairs.  I got all the bells and whistles.  A second row of leather captain chairs, an entertainment system for the kids, and 4 wheel drive (on the console.  No, you won't have a limo pull up to you and ask if you have any "grey poupon" but is that what you want?

Their are "little things" about this truck that just flat out bug me.  If you don't fasten your seat belt the chime alarm will not go off.  Remind me once, then shut up.  This thing is so alarming.  I am a fan of seat belts but when you run to the store that is 1 mile away and get chimed at 15 times, it wears on you.  The AC max control has an annoying habit of this 5 second delay before the AC will kick in.  In Texas in august, ANY delay is unwelcome in a car that easily reaches 120 degrees inside.  The keyless entrance pad on the door works when it feels like it.  I hate to carry car keys so I always throw them in the glove box and just punch in my code to enter.  I've had occassions whereby I have entered my code 7 or more times before it opens.  Drives me crazy.  Lastly, the sound system and especially the radio don't appear to be updated in 10 years.  It is the most stock looking bland radio and CD player I've ever seen.  Yes, it was kind of Ford to put a sub-woofer in the back but how about ergonomics?  Asthetics?  That radio is hideous looking.

Tips for outrigging your Expedition.  I also didn't care for the two-tone color that Ford forces you to purchase their Eddie Bauer version in.  I got the Eddie Bauer to get other options that only come with it (i.e. 2nd row captain's chairs).  I disliked the two tone so much that I had the fender flares painted the same color as the truck making it a uniform one-tone color.  Looks MUCH better.  Invert those white letter tires to the solid black side and you have a tough looking truck.  Do yourself a favor and get the 2nd row captain's chairs and NOT the bench seating.  First off, no one enjoys bench seating, it is so uncomfortable.  Throw in the 3rd row of seats and forget trying to climb back there.  The 2nd row captain chairs offer a much more comfortable ride for your passengers and makes getting to the 3rd row a snap.  Also, get heated seats!  I didn't and on cold winter days, those seats feel like dry ice.  Big oversite.

I chose the Expedition over it's rival the GMC Tahoe because the Tahoe looked so much wimpier and smaller compared to the Expedition.  It sits so low to the groud that my Expedition makes it look like a station wagon.  I didn't care for it at all.  If anything, I wish I would have given the new Chevy Suburban a look but I didn't want a vehicle quite that big.  

That's it.  Hope this helps your decision.
