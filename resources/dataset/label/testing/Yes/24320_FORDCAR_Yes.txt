            My wife picked up a 1994 Escort LX a couple of years ago from a friend for the dirt-cheap price of $800.  The car had 136,000 miles on it, and the dealer wouldn't give her friend any more than the $800 as a trade-in.  I have never been a Ford fanatic (my previous experience was limited to a Pinto), so although I liked the price and the car looked good, I figured it was due for the boneyard at any moment.
Two years later, the Escort has 186,000 miles on it and is still running strong.  Total repair bills consist of front brakes ($120.00)  A rear strut is now leaking and will cost about $300.00.  Insurance is minimal.  It's not burning oil.  Gas mileage remains at about 35 per gallon.  In short, we are getting more miles per dollar out of this car than any other car I have ever owned.
My old '89 Subaru GL sedan lost its transmission a few months ago, creating an unexpected financial crisis.  We needed another car quickly, but had very little money and could not afford more payments.  After some intensive comparison shopping, we found - guess what - a 1994 escort wagon.  For $1,750.00 and a new set of tires, I bought a very clean, no rust wagon with 125,000 miles from a local used car dealer.  I have had it checked out mechanically, and it looks like all it will need is a new muffler within six months.  That's it.  Runs great and I'm getting almost 40 miles per gallon.  I couldn't be happier, especially since everything else that I was considering in similar condition was at least twice as much.
From my perspective, the upsides of the '94 escort are 1) the market value has depreciated to the point that they are one of the cheapest cars on the lot, 2) even with relatively high mileage, the engine seems to run well (built by Mazda rather than by Ford, I am told), 3) very inexpensive to drive, maintain and repair, 4) not especially prone to rust, and 5) lots of them around for comparison shopping, parts, etc.
On the downside, Escorts are obviously not a luxury driving experience.  They are noisy.  The turning radius is poor.  They don't shift easily (both are standard transmissions).  The interiors are small and not particularly comfortable.  You aren't going to outrun anyone not driving a Yugo or a moped.  But hey, we're not talking Car & Driver, we're talking get to work and back for the least amount of money.  And in terms of bottom line cost, the '94 Escort is for me the bargain of the used car lot.
