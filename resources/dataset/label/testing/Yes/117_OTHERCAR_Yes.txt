            My husband bought me this Fuji Camera for me.  I buy and sell alot on ebay and with all the photos I had to take, he thought this would be better.  I was leary.  Digital I said.  Sounds complicated.

The camera is lightweight, silver in color and not a lot of buttons or dials to work with.  It comes with softwear to hook it right up to your computer, which we did.

So we started by playing around and you know..it is fun.

The view finder is nice and can act like a video view finder showing everything in front of it even as you move.  I like this feature alot.

It has only two modes for pictures one is normal and then magnified 2x.  It is easy and has an automatic flash and focus abilities.  It has red eye reduction and a little hand to help you with shakiness.

when you go to take your picture you have two lights  red or green.  Of course green is go, and then you click the shutter button and you take the pic, wait maybe 2 seconds and in the view finder is the picture you just took.  Now is the fun part..don't like it...trash it.  Yep, you can get rid of it and do it again.  I like that a lot.  Not that I take bad pics but, hey, we are not all perfect.

After you take your pictures you go to you computer and attach the plug to your camera and go to the program and it is so easy to transfer pictures from the disc, to the puter.  The worst part of this is I use batteries and this stage eats the batteries very fast, so an AC adapter is a must for this.  

I like the camera and very happy my husband thought of me to buy it.  He bought me a lap top two years ago, he now has it at work for his business...check with me in two years to see who has the camera LOL.  Gotta love them, huh ladies.  :-)<br><br>
