            The reason for buying the forester, was to buy a new car for a family with kids and a car that would be good in the mountains and around town.  The Subaru is everything we could want.  It is a five speed with great kick for a 4 cylinder engine.  It's awesome for toting everyone around in.  Really comfortable for road trips.  Dependable (for the months we've had it.  It looks really great.  It drives like a dream, smooth, and clean.  All wheel drive, handles really well.  I recommend this vehicle to anyone.  It would be good for a big family or a couple.  It doesn't matter.<br><br>
