            I recently purchased a Fuji FinePix 2400 camera from www.beachcamera.com.  It was $291.  (If you're going to buy one, be sure to go to http://www.pricescan.com to compare prices and look at pricing trends before you buy!)

The camera comes with some great features: 2.1 megapixel 1600x1200 images, decent software built into the camera and for use on your computer.  The in-camera software takes a little getting used to, but compared to some of the other digital cameras I have used, its pretty good.  The hardest part is working out what the up/down left/right arrows do when interacting with the menus.

It actually comes with paper manuals, which is a plus these days.  The one for the camera itself could be a little better, but overall its easy to understand.  Since this camera has an automatic mode for more casual photographers, you could use it without hardly ever cracking the book.  On the other hand, if you're going to do more serious stuff, such as mess with the white balance or EV Settings, you may need to work a little harder.   There are some cool features that you only uncover after you read up (like the slow sync setting for the flash for nighttime photography).

You definitely need to get NiCad or similar rechargeable batteries--you're going to need them, this thing does use them up kind of fast (especially if you do alot of shooting with the video display turned on).  

You will want to make friends with some of the online photo services so you can upload your pictures for professional prints.  My three favorites are: http://www.shutterfly.com, http://www.snapfish.com and http://www.photoaccess.com.  All three currently offer 20 or more free prints when you sign up, so even if you have a pretty good photo printer, its still worth trying these out too.

My biggest worry with the camera is the fact that everytime you turn it on or off, the optical lens collapses itself in.  I think this will be the "weakest link" in the camera and I am afraid it will break too easily.

July 2002: As much as I love this camera, it has now broken twice in the time that I have had it.  First the lens broke and was repaired under warranty.  Now there's a problem with the camera cutting off randomly.
