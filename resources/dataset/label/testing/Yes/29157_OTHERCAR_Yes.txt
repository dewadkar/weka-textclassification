            Recently I purchased a 99 Plymouth Neon Expresso.  I bought this vehicle b/c my other car was biting the dust.  And we needed something newer and more reliable.  After careful consideration we finally decided on the one we have now.  Forest Green, moon roof, four door, power everything, and already wired for a remote cd changer, which is something we plan on purchasing.  I love this vehicle b/c it has been reliable, it's cute, it's an automatic, everything works well in it, the moonroof, and it's a four door, which makes things alot easier when there is more than just my husband and me in the car.  The only thing I hate about this car, is the small engine.  It doesn't have much for pickup.  I am used to driving a car with a V6 engine in it, and this is not.  To drive this vehicle is great.  In the summer I love to drive with the moonroof open, and the windows down.  Who should buy this vehicle?  Well, if you are a student, or anyone else with a small wallet like we are, then this vehicle is for you.  It's a cheap car that looks and runs great.  It gets me where I need to go without any problems, and if there are, the warrenty I purchased covers most of it.  Who shouldn't buy this car?  Well if you want something with alot of pickup and go, this is not for you.  This is not a car you can drag race down the highway with someone else. It's not a very large car either, but it's safe and reliable.  <br><br>
