            I have been shopping for an SUV for some time, and after driving my 1995 Chevy Blazer for 5 years (a great vehicle but I wanted something new-see the opinion I wrote on this site about the Blazer), I had some high expectations for the new car to live up to.  I just bought a 2000 Black Pathfinder SE (sport model) and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  It's not just because it's a new beautiful car, either.

I had been shopping around and wanted to spend no more than $27,000.  The car that caught my eye the most at first was the Toyota 4 Runner, but they are packaged deals that give you NO room for negotiation, and the 1999 and 2000 cars are being sold at no less than $1500 below sticker (and that's if you're a GREAT negotiator) so plan on spending $31,000+ for a base model.  You'll get MUCH more for your money with a Pathfinder-a better car all around, much safer and less top heavy, and at a lower cost.

So I went into the NISSAN dealership planning to test drive the new Nissan Xterra.  It was a fine vehicle, with the same engine as the Pathfinder, but it rides more like a truck, and has some strange add-ons that didn't particularly appeal to me.  For example the weird luggage rack...something I would want to remove.  Anyway, the souped up Xterra SE with all the options ran $26,700 after I negotiated only $100 off sticker.  Nissan only made about 70,000 of them (new car for Nissan)and they're in much more demand than Nissan originally intended.

Needless to say, I went back and forth between two local Nissan dealers, playing them against eachother, and ended up getting a Black 2000 Pathfinder SE (not the sunroof option, but the SE includes many extras!!  All I need!) for the EXACT same price!  It lists around $31,200, but there are always great incentives (I bought it right before the new year, and got $1750 cash back in incentives).  There's always something going on.  SO DON&quot;T PAY STICKER!  PLAY THE GAME!  IT GETS OLD QUICK, BUT ANYONE CAN DO IT!!!!!

So here I am with a shiny black beautiful safe SUV with MANY extras for $26,700!  All my friends love it and can't believe the deal I got!  Don't let anyone boss you around. Do your research online, find out how much they're REALLY making on the car, and confront them (nicely, of course).  And don't back down.  You CAN get the car of your dreams at a somewhat affordable price!  And THIS ONE'S A BEAUT!!!!!  Rides smoother than anything I could imagine, and I STILL can't find anything I don't like about it!<br><br>
