            I've seen several digital cameras in my time. This has to be the best pick for the all around user. It's not a &quot;super deluxe oh my goodness what kind of camera is this!&quot; But, it's not a &quot;eh, I've had better.&quot; kind of camera either. It's good for the general use by the average individual.

I bought one for my business here a while back and I've had good luck with it. There's a couple of tricks to using it, though. First of all, don't take every picture with the LCD screen on. If you do, you'll burn through battery power after about 4 pictures. You can take pictures just fine using the regular view finder and it'll display the picture  for about a second after you snap the picture. Also, you can fit more pictures by adjusting the resolution and picture size. The higher the resolution and the bigger the picture, the fewer pictures will fit on the camera. I fit about 21 pictures that were optimized for regular sized prints.

The camera is very easy to customize to your individual needs. You can adjust it for a variety of different settings. It also lets you setup scripts to automate certain tasks that you perform regularly. It also comes with several preprogrammed scripts to assist you in setting up your camera.

Coloring and flesh tones come out very nicely. Something that I would expect from Kodak.

I would recommend this product to families and individuals who don't need top of the line products. As far as I'm concerned, this product is great for the money and does exactly what I want it to do. I don't need all the fancy bells and whistles and this doesn't waste my money on them.<br><br>
