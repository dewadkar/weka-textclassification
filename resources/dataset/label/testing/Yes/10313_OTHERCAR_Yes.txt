               In '95, I needed a family car, and I needed to start a credit history, so we decided to lease one.  Altima became the car of choice for its room, power (the most powerful in its class, 2.5 liter 150 hp 4-cylinder engine), and comfort.
   In the 5 years that followed, I abused it tremendously:  took it to Shasta, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, all the way through California and Oregon; camping, skiing, - you name it.  The only serious reason to take it to the shop has been to change oil and - once - to replace a dash fan resistor under warranty.
   It is not a sports car, but the 5-speed handles like one, especially when I get into it from my Subaru Outback.
   Good design in and out; a little bit too wide amplitude of the gear shifter, feels almost like a pickup truck, especially for someone with short arms.<br><br>
