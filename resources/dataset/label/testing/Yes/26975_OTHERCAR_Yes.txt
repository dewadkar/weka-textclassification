            My Skylark and I have been together for almost six years now, and I've never been more satisfied with a car.

After test driving similar cars and feeling like my face was in the windshield, I fell in love with the roomy-feeling interior.  The ride was smooth, too, especially for a car its size. 

The anti-lock brakes have been a life saver (probably literally) several times.  It is easily maneuverable, and can fly when appropriate.  The most angry I've ever been at the car was when the battery died while I was out of town, but I suppose that's not the car's fault.

There's an amazing amount of room in the trunk, so it's great for vacations.  The seat backs recline and the angle of the seat itself can be changed.  Personally, I love taking it on trips of six hours or so.  Eight hours or more get a little uncomfortable in my opinion.  (But, hey, it's a lot cheaper than a Town Car!)

The doors automatically lock when the car is put into gear, and unlock when the car is turned off.  I like that safety feature, but it irritates people like my Dad who like to jump out of the car before I've completely stopped.  

My last car was larger, so I'm now stopping at the gas station twice a month instead of twice a week.  I still get compliments on the way it looks, too.  If the last six years are any indication of the future, it wouldn't surprise me if I kept this car fifteen years or so.  I highly recommend it.
