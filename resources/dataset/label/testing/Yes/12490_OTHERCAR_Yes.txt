            In May of 2000, my parents surprised me when they gave me my sister's 1995 Chevy Beretta. It is red and has a V-6 engine. I previously had a 1991 GMC Sonoma so I was very pleased to get a car. My Beretta is in perfect condition and I have never had any problems with it at all, maybe because we take very good care of vehicles in my family. When I drive down the road I always see Beretta's that look horrible... paint peeling off,etc. Being in college now, this is a great car for me. It gets great gas mileage; I fill the tank every 315 miles. It doesn't have the best looks though. It comes with 3 cup holders which is great when you drive your friends everywhere. When I drive on the interstate I notice much more road noise. When you hit 85 or so it gets a little louder. This car has the potential of exceeding great speed. I have only hit 115mph (don't tell mom), but I believe this car can go well over that.
The backseats don't leave much room for your legs, which is a minus, but there is plenty of room in the front and lots of 'storage compartments' and other little gadgets. We paid my sister $5000 for the car and it only had 60000 miles on it. It now has a little over 87000. Of course we've put new tires on it once or twice, but that has nothing to do with the car itself. Overall, it is a great car if you buy it in good condition, which is rare to find these days. It's exterior is not that great for a college student, personally I can't wait to afford a new vehicle. But, for now, this will do!
