            I bought the Chevrolet Cavalier because I wanted a small, reliable, and affordable car. It has met my expectations in all cases. I really like the design, because it has a sporty look, and I like the fact that it is more reliable on the road than some of the other small cars I've owned. While it's perfect for me at 5'7&quot; tall, I've known some of my 6'+ friends to complain about it being too small for their comfort. The car handles well, including a sense of safety in winter driving. By keeping up with scheduled maintenance, I've had almost no problems. The only repair I've had to do is to have the resistor on the heater fan replaced. If you're looking for a small, affordable, reliable car, I would recommend it. If you're looking for lots of leg room, check for a bigger model.
