            Ok ok, so it's not my car. But my friend just turned 17, and got his first car: a 1990 Accord EX Coupe. You might be thinking, &quot;Ok, 1990? That's kind of old for a car.&quot; Let me tell you - this car must've been awesome back in the day, because even now (with 140,000 miles) it's a very comfortable, quiet, smooth ride.

First off, the design quality. Honda does it again (only ten years ago) with comfortable, supportive seats, easy to use instruments, and a relatively roomy backseat. The front seats are particularly comfortable. They feel firm, but not hard. The cloth interior is very smooth and easy to sit on, as opposed to my other friend's Mustang, whose cloth is hard and almost brush like. Even the backseat is comfortable! (although a tad cramped)

Second, even after 140,000 miles, the car still feels exceptionally responsive and strong. I'm not totally sure, but I think it's a 4 cylinder engine. It provides adequate acceleration, and is pretty quiet, except at higher speeds. (60+) The automatic transmission felt accurate and quick, however I'm pretty sure that it robs the car of some of its power. But it was all he could get since he doesn't know how to drive a stick. :)

The trunk was well designed too. I bet that sounds dumb, but it's true - the opening is large enough to fit things that are large, and the trunk itself will hold a lot of cargo. Plus, there's enough room to put, say, a couple 12&quot; subs back there and an amp. This is a must have for any teenage driver.

Standard equipment (I'm guessing, not totally sure about all this) for his EX model - Alloy wheels, (14&quot; or 15&quot;) Power everything, cruise, tilt wheel, A/C, ABS, and I'm not totally sure, but I believe the sunroof was either optional, or an aftermarket one installed by the previous owner.

Would I recommend this car? Yes. Number one, it's a Honda. Number two, Hondas last until around 200,000+ miles. And he got it for $4500. That's a pretty good deal, especially in the Seattle area where Hondas are particularly expensive, due to the popularity.<br><br>
