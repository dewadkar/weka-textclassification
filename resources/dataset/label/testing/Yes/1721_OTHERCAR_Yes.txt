            My father owns a Volvo 850, ('96 model), and it drives great and is very comfortable. This station wagon is one of the few luxury wagons out on the market and comes in a variety of packages. We personally own the luxury package, and it is wonderful and loaded with plenty of amenities. This vehicle makes a wonderful family car, I and I would highly recommend it for the family who likes to take those vacations. Overall, two thumbs up!<br><br>
