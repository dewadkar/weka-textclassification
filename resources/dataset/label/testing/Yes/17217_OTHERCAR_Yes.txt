            I do solemnly swear that the 1991 Mercury Capri will someday be a collectors item.  Probably someday soon.  There were only a limited number of these cars made, and they break down fairly regularly, so I assume they are even more rare today than when they were first put on the market.

On the good side, these small, sleek, unique, and usually convertible, little cars are a visual treat and a rare find.  There is nothing more rewarding than cruising along, looking &quot;cool&quot; and enjoying the clear summer sky with the top down on a warm day.  It just makes you happy to be alive.  Not even the fact that there is a strange bumping sound coming from somewhere near your back right tire can get you down.  In addition, it gets extremely good gas mileage, which is VERY nice when gas prices seem to double every other month or so.  

As for seating, it has a nice little back seat that comfortably fits two or three small children and (uncomfortably) fits two adults.  This is a good thing, though.  It is the perfect excuse to not have to give rides to people you don't like (&quot;Ooh...sorry about that, my car's just too small...&quot;), while at the same time allowing you enough room to take the two extra people if you <i>really</i> need to, or really like them (and they don't mind getting very close to one another in the back seat ;-).

If you're a speed junkie, let me warn you though, this car is NOT fast.  It's a pretty mild mannered little thing.  The acceleration is zero to sixty in about as many minutes.  This can be a good thing though, if it's a first car, or if you have a tendency to otherwise crash into things (like I do).  The delayed acceleration has kept me from having any accidents in this car, whereas the truck that I had before this car, I regularly rammed into parked vehicles and other non-moving obstacles because I'm a little bit heavy-footed.

However, there is a dark side to this fun little ride.  The repairs.  The repairs.  The repairs.  If you plan on owning one of these cars, and driving it around, budget out around $500-$1,000/year for repairs and maintenance.  

I've owned my Capri since 1995, and it seems to break down regularly, about once every three months or so.  Well, <i>break down</i> is probably an exaggeration.  Technically, it has only <i>broken down</i> about three times.  Once the automatic transmission went out ($1,500 to repair..but I think I kind of got a bad deal by taking it to a Ford dealership.  It seems like they always charge more there for the &quot;privilege&quot; of having &quot;manufacturer's parts&quot;.)  The transmission seemed to be having the same exact problem about a year later, but I took it to an Aamco (they specialize in trasmission repair) instead, and the repair only cost $230.  The car didn't actually BREAK down, but it was planning on it.  It just kept running slower and slower and getting less and less acceleration.  Turns out there was some gadget (yes, that is the technical term for any car part that I imagine to be small and have no other useful information about) slipping out, and the transmission shop had to plug it back in and everything was fine.

Then, once around the same time as the first transmission repair, the wheel bearings went bad.  They were making a really bad grinding, scraping noise.  I don't know how much that would have cost to fix because it was covered by the dealership.

The brakes have needed a $400 repair job, and various other small but mandatory repairs have needed to be made.  Usually, any time I bring it into the shop, I can count on it costing at least $100, and usually between $200 and $300.  Occassionally it can take a long time to get the parts because the car is rare and needs parts that are specifically made for it, which most mechanics will have to special order.

However, although it <i>does</i> seem to break down a lot, I think that ALL cars break down.  It's all about how <i>good</i> you look driving around in it (when it's working), and whether or not you're willing to pay the price. ;-)<br><br>
