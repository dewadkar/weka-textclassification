            This Olympus is an excellent camera for the money.  I picked mine up for just under $300, and would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a simple point and shoot digital camera.

The unit is not exactly �pocket sized� in the same way as my old 35mm Olympus Mu was, but it does fit comfortably into cargo pants pockets and is comfortable to hold.

It has far more features than I�ve bothered to discover as I use it as a basic camera, either for social pictures, or at work if I need to take a quick photo of a venue.  Using the camera is really easy, and in taking pictures there is really no difference from a 35mm unit.  There are options for close up, action, automatic or manual flash, along with red eye reduction.

In ordinary usage the memory card holds 30 pictures, but you can improve the resolution of your photos by switching to 9, or just four pictures per memory card.  I have no idea what 1.3 million pixels would look like, but the basic resolution is fine for me.

I have been using the same SmartMedia 2MB memory card for six months with no deterioration.  The thirty shots do last much longer than a 36 exposure film because the unit includes a small viewing screen that allows you to decide whether or not you want to delete a shot, so you can ditch any substandard pictures straight away.  The unit even has a neat little finger guide to make sure you don�t take pictures to your thumb.

You can also use the small viewing window as a view finder, but do remember that this will drain your batteries very quickly.  The money you save on film and developing with this camera is balanced by the way it eats batteries.  It takes 4 AA type batteries and I get through a set every couple of weeks.

Downloading your images is really easy as the camera comes with its own software.  This also allows you to tidy up your pictures and store them.  The best thing about any digital camera is that you can get home and get your pictures out to friends and family almost immediately either by e-mail or by publishing them on the web.  This makes it great for parents, or parents to be, along with people who have wide spread friends and family.  This unit saves all your photos in a web ready jpeg format, so you don�t need to be a techie.

Overall I recommend this Olympus as a great first digital camera for anyone.  However, as functional as this camera is for special events I prefer to take a 35mm camera along too.  The quality of photos is better and nobody wants to keep a memory card of their loved ones in their wallet!
