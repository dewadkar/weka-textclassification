            I am a single, middle aged male. At times I may need to haul people and other times cargo. Being disabled, anything I may want to haul that would require a fullsized truck would be too much for me to handle. Better to pay rare delivery charges and save the $15,000 more a totally equipped Ram with diesel lists for.

Having had a full sized Ram Extended cab and a Chevy crew cab dually, for me both were overkill. The Nissan crew cab is exactly suited for my all around needs and is significantly less expensive in purchase price and maintenance. I am not planning to go doing death defying four wheeling or go only a Humvee would go either. Having bought one totally decked out, there just isn't much much to spend on aftermarket additions with the possible exception of Vent guards.

Insurance is much cheaper than either my Ram or Chevy were. Gas mileage is also better and seemed to increase after the 1,000 mile break in was over.

The truck is easy to handle and, being smaller than I was used to, it's easy to speed in it and things happen sooner than expected. It handles high winds as well as could be expected for a truck, but not the battle I've had in a full sized van.<br><br>
