            I had drooled over the 350's ever since they came out, but never thought that I would have one seeing as they were a two seater, and I had a young daughter, and 3 people can't fit in two seats.

Anyhow, as I had opened up a new business it came absolutely imperative for me to have a new vehicle, AND especially since my husband wasn't about to let me drive off into the sunset.... or to a business meeting with his other woman - a 97 Nissan Maxima, the need was justified.

We started shopping, nothing really appealed to me in our very limited price range, we had wanted something in the 24K mark, but ended up getting talked into a 28K deal and a black on black RX-8.  To make a short story shorter, I ended up trading it in after 1 month for a 2003 350Z Enthusiast model with 500 miles.

Silverstone, grey cloth interior, as soon as I stepped inside this beauty, I realized I had come home.  It's as if the car fit like a glove.  He was nothing like the RX-8 which made me feel more awkward than at peace...and I realized, despite the two seats, I had made a beautiful decision.

The car turns heads wherever we go, and not that I bought the car just for looks, people never get sick of seeing a 350.

Acceleration is nifty, the throttle responsive, and the handling is something you'll only dream of in a Sedan.
Another wonderful thing, and even as a woman I can appreciate the exhaust.  The sound is aaahh, some kind of wonderful.  It's a true sports car symphony, yet with it's price tag you'll wonder how Nissan pulled it off.  Infact the engine is based off a similar Maxima engine, and with the longivity of our car, I'll be racing this thing when I'm 60!

The interior is where the 350 is a little lacking in my opinion.  The interior pieces, such as the sunglasses holder, the cup tray are all, well, cheaply made.  Mine has already broken and won't stay shut properly, but it's a small trade off for the driving experience.  Nice smooth gauges everywhere, beautiful ergonomic dash - these are the strong parts.  Now, the door handles are a little on the cheap side as are the window buttons, and I hate that about the car, so much I am looking for aftermarket replacements.  But again, the driving experience far outweighs these small errors in design.

The exterior is beautiful and sleek, the paint is glossy and shiny.  I really wanted a blue one, but as I got mine on dealers terms (read, I was able to trade my RX-8 clean and clear for the 350z with some side cash for mods) I didn't have much choice.
I personally hate the chrome doorhandles, they're also on the cheap side.  The back end of the car is gorgeous, I love the way it's sleek design flows over the whole car.  The headlights are beautiful and crisp, but I am thinking about changing out my sidemarkers for clears.
The engine bay is beautiful, atleast in my opinion, and at the track you can pop your hood with pride, even though it's stock.

Now, as this car accelerates quickly, you're often going over the speed limit without realizing it.  The first few weeks I noticed I was really guzzling the gas, but after reviewing my speed for a week, I realized that going 80 is going to chew through more gas than going 65 ot 70.  Just that extra 10 miles per hour will really make a dent in your pocket.  Word from experience, watch your speed if you don't want to be constantly filling it up.

There really isn't anything extraordinarily negative I can say about the car.  Only I wish there was more cargo space - but, that's what we have the Maxima for.  So while I have my sports car, my husband and "his other lady" are toting around the kid and groceries, while I'm out cutting the curves!
What can I say, I love my 350Z !!  Test drive one, my reivew does no justice to the actual experience of hopping in it, starting it up and driving it home!
