            I don't think that I had many reasons why I actually purchased this vehicle besides its low price. I bought my 1992 MX-3 GS for $3,500 from its first owner. At the time it had 96,000 with all the maintenance records. And that's what you want to look for when you buy a used car. First talk to the cars owner, and then test drive the vehicle. If you have any debuts about the owners &quot;story&quot; about this car, you are most likely right. Everybody knows when someone tries to sell you a lemon. A first owner vehicle with all records plus printout from &quot;carfax.com&quot; should do the job.
Moving on. My MX-3 is an incredibly reliable car. No matter if its 45 or 105 degrees outside, this car will start and heat up or cool off in matter of seconds! Its a great gas mileage car as well. However if you are an everyday highway driver you won't like it as much, due to its high rpm engine (its quite loud in its 80-90mph speeds). But if you are looking for summer/winter to work/school vehicle, this is it. It isn't a car for more than two people and a kid. It's little tight on the back seat (but comfortable for kids). 
The MX-3 with a 1.8 V6 is a great car. It has way enough power for its size. If you like cars like I do, you will love its engine sound! It has a deep sound of a race car. It will handle very well through all kinds of curves and corners.
You should buy this car only if you like small size vehicles with power, and only if you will use it for your self or occasionally for extra one/two people with you (not for long trips thought). I can imagine taking it for 1000+ trip only by my self or with one extra person comfortably.
I cannot think of any more reasons why you should or shouldn't buy this car, but if you have any questions about this vehicle, I will be more than glad to answer them for you :) (PaulSchab@aol.com)
