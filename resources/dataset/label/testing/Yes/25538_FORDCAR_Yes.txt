            <b>I THOUGHT I WANTED A FORD ESCAPE</b>
Being somewhat of an environmentalist it was important for me to purchase a vehicle that got good gas mileage. As such, I went to the dealership thinking the new Ford Escape would be just the ticket.  However, when I sat inside and felt the limited padding and rather cheapish materials I knew I just couldn't live with it. Then I spied it across the lot, the new Explorer Sport Trac. It was like no vehicle I had ever seen.  Was it an SUV or a truck...I didn't care.  Once I sat in it I was hooked and all thoughts of good gas mileage somehow dropped from my priority list.

<b>EXTERIOR: 10</b>
For me, the exterior rates a clear ten! It is truly innovative. Not just a truck with four doors and not just a SUV with a glued on bed. Nope. This puppy was REALLY well thought out. I love how the four doors mold in an elliptic form, how it utilizes curves and angles. Very sexy. I also love how the bed is likewise curved and raised.  And who thought of the recycled, nearly bullet and scratch proof bed. I also like the tonneau cover, although a bit pricey it is absolutely fantastic. Unlike traditional tonneau's this one hinges in the middle, can be locked tight, is easily lifted on or off with just one person (without need of steroids) and is strong enough to jump on. It's like having a bed and a huge watertight trunk at the same time!

<b>INTERIOR: 10</b>
The interior I also rated a ten. It too is truly innovative. My favs are the stylish use of upholstery materials. Very handsome and a great alternative for those of us that are opposed to leather. The white-faced instruments are also appealing without being garish. The softpak removable storage holder, berber on rubber floor mats and rear electric window are nifty beyond compare. The CD player offers good but not great sound, not bad for standard fare. And the seats are...well, I could live in them. I also like how the rear seats fold down nearly flat but still are fairly plush. And this rig truly seats five people, with legroom to spare.

<b>RIDE & HANDLING: 7</b>
Prior to the Sport Trac I owned a truck, so I'm used to a fairly stiff ride. All things considered the ride and handling rate about a seven. It is certainly comfy, a far more plush and quiet ride than my old Ford Ranger. Even my Grandmother gave it two thumbs up. Still, when pushed hard in corners it shows nearly all of it's two-ton plus weight, keeling over more than I prefer. I also have minor complaints regarding slight wind/road noise at speeds over 60mph and some minor rattles coming from within the dash area. And the Firestone tires...I can't wait to buy another brand.

<b>ENGINE: 8</b>
The 4.0L V6 runs well and has plenty of power. Again, not being a car enthusiast I'm happy with anything that does 0-60 in less than a minute, so 8.8 seconds is pretty good in my book. I even burned a little rubber at the grocery store (must have been reminiscing about my younger years). The gas mileage is, however, a shocker to me. I know all you Jeep Grand Cherokee owners are used to it, but 15mpg in pure city driving and 20mpg on the highway is something I'm just not used to. One consolation, I was pleased the Sport Trac is rated LEV (low emission vehicle)...so I guess my sense of environmentalism is still marginally intact.

<b>FIT & FINISH: 8</b>
Overall I'm pleased with the fit and finish of the Sport Trac. Most things fit well and are well manufactured. The door shut very solidly (unlike the Ford Escape), the tailgate works smoothly and the body panels inside and out are, for the most part, well fitted.  Of course once one buys a new vehicle there is always room for improvement (unless it's a Lexus). For example, my hood needed repainting due to an obvious factory blemish. The gas-door was not aligned perfectly, causing it to rub the paint when opening and closing. And I had some squeaks and clicks coming from the front suspension going over small bumps in the road.

<b>VALUE: 10</b>
Dang, I got such a GREAT price on this vehicle that I can't help but rate it a ten. The sticker price was over $28,000 (not counting dealer markup which made it even higher) but I picked it up for a tad over $23,000. Even without the great price it is still a great value. Name another vehicle that you can take five people up skiing without being cramped, carry muddy mountain bikes along dusty trails, haul gravel without scratching the bed, roll down the back window to scruff your dog's head (actually my dog sits inside) and still turn heads when you drive in downtown traffic?

<b>SUMMARY</b>
After three months of ownership the Explorer Sport Trac is everything I hoped it would be...excluding the mileage thing. It's Awesome Dawson, a Great Mate, Super Duper, Free & Easy and as FUN, FUN, FUN as it gets!
