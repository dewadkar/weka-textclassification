            After four years of driving a sports car, I had a hard time finding a family car with the power that I was used to.  Until I found the LHS, that is.  With 253 HP, it has a lot more pep than most other cars its size and price.  The fuel economy is decent (19 city, 26 highway), and the standard features are impressive.  It only has a few options available--everything else is standard.  It comes standard with AM/FM/CD/Tape.  It has two separate memories for the seats, side mirrors, and radio settings.  The seats are leather, and the front seats have built-in heaters.  It has climate control, so you just set it to the temperature you want and it adjusts the A/C, heater, and fan controls to maintain the temperature.  We've taken it out of town twice on trips, and it has been a joy to drive!  It only came with a 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty, but we haven't had any problems with it.

UPDATE - ONE YEAR LATER

We've had the car for a year (and 25,000 miles), and we're still as much in love with it as we were in the beginning.  It's incredibly comfortable to drive, especially on long trips.

The only minor problem we had with it was that the power steering hose came loose, draining the power steering fluid into a puddle at the gas station.  The dealership replaced the pump and had us back on the road in less than a day, at no cost to us.

UPDATE - THREE YEARS LATER

We've had the car for over three years (and 55,000 miles), and it's still a great car.  We haven't had any other problems with it.

Chrysler has moved the LHS into the Concorde line in the last couple years.  What they now call the "Chrysler Concorde Limited" is basically the same car as the LHS.
