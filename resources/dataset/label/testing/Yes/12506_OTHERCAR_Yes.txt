            Bought this car used its a 1998 conti loaded.  I paid about $15K for it, it had allot of highway miles 80,000. It was a good deal cause Edmunds rated this car at $20k.  This was a company car, it looks like its show room new.  I love the power but I wish it had about 15 more Horse power which they changed in 1999 :(.  it's a nice ride, however you can tell it's a ford.  I hate the way the doors close very 80's like thunk.  It seems they also weigh a ton as well. They always close on my legs when I park on the street.  I hate that about the car, doors should not close on you, nor make a loud thump when closed.  By comparison by brothers Explorers doors make a nice ka-shunk sound like import cars. The leater on the car seems cheap as well it cracks fast, and the seats have no side bolster for support.  I think the tranny shifts too fast around 10 mph.  I needs to fix the brakes and stabilizer control links, cause the car made all kinds of weird noises in the front.  thank God it wasent the air struts $300 a pop.  I also got a full tune up and serpinetine belt changed.  Now the car runs nice, however there is a weird noise from the engine.  It sounds like its revving without me giving gas, when I look at the rpm's though they are not moving?? other than these few setbacks I love the car.  I raced a friend of mine in his new 325 Bmw wich is a stick shift with only 6k miles and I beat him by 2 car lenghts off the light :) JBL is nice. Leave the settings on firm and high steering effort. Handles nice for a big boat. Awesome trunk space, however the back room is not as good as I thaught it would be for a big car? I love the front new wraparound headlights with the chrome grill. over all this car gets a B. Hope this helps.<br><br>
