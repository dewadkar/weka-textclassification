            We bought our 97 STS in July, 1999, just before we went on vacation.  I had wanted a larger car for some time since I was not comfortable on long trips in our Honda Accord.  When we saw this car at the dealer, my wife and I bought it and drove it home the same day.  We have the Mulberry Red with matching interior, one of the prettiest colors in the Cadillac line, we think.  

The car has live up to our expectations.  We have taken two long trips, one a thousand miles and one two thousand miles.  The comfort of the ride is everything we expected and wanted.  Usually after a trip, I have a headache from the tension of driving.  Not on these trips!  My wife and I commented several times about how comfortable it was.  The power seats and automatic temperature features are features that add to the pleasure of driving.  The ride is smooth, with just the right amount of stiffness to make handling easy.  On the open road we averaged over 25 mpg with an average speed of 60 mph.  There is plenty of power to handle any situation without straining the engine.

There are only two things at the present time that we have found that we do not like.  One is that there is some wind noise around the doors when we are on the open road.  It is not bad but still I did not expect any noise from a Cadillac.  The second has to do with the CD player.  We had the dealer add one when we bought the car.  It does not have the shuffle feature.  There has to be an added button on the dash for this feature to work.  I can't believe that Cadillac would make a luxury car of this caliber and not have this feature.  <br><br>
