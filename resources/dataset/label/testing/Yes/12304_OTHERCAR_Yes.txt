            	Okay, I admit it. I never outgrew sports cars. I have owned fast cars all my life. My first car was a bright red, brand-new, 1965 Pontiac GTO. Zero to sixty in under 6! You know. Since then I have moved from Triumphs to the famous 240Z. Along the way was a Toyota wagon and a bright red MR2. Needless to say that bright red 2000 Eclipse GT was an irresistible force when I spotted it in front of our local Mitsubishi dealer. This car is truly beautiful. It just looks fast. 
	A test drive confirmed that this car performs the way it looks-really fast!  It was my first 5-speed after nearly three years of a Toyota Camry wagon and a Nissan Pathfinder, so I will admit my sports car senses weren't as finely tuned as they might have been. But a few minutes in the Eclipse brought back a flood of wonderful memories. Needless to say, I signed on the dotted line and began a 28,000 mile adventure with my new, red toy.
	Many people have written about the 2000 Eclipse. Many of them mourn the loss of the older, less-refined model that was the delight of the teenage set. The old Eclipse was smaller, a little faster, rougher, noisy, and not appealing to the over-30 set. Mitsubishi set out to attract the older, better-heeled empty-nesters who could now afford to return to the classic coupes of their youth. This new version lives up to that market. It's a bit wider, quieter, and much more comfortable for those over-40 bodies. Is this a bad thing? Not to me. The car still behaves like a true sports car.
	On the road, the Eclipse is a bit rough around the edges, but refined enough to be tolerable to an older driver like me. Acceleration is very good as you would expect in a light car powered by a snappy 206 horse V6. Steering is not as tight as it should be, the wheel lacks solid road feel and the car tends to float around tight turns. All that said, the Eclipse stays on its track without complaint even when pushed around those tight two-lane highway turns. The engine makes a nice growl when pushed and power doesn't fall off until the really high revs. I frequently go from a standing start to 55 before leaving second gear. The car is plain fun to drive.
	Amenities are pretty good too. The radio has great sound with satisfying bass and truly crystal clear highs. The CD player is great, never skipped once! My car also came with a cassette deck as well. I have to confess I never tried it. The air conditioning provides enough cooling to make the cabin comfortable on even the hottest days. The moon roof (part of the &quot;fun and sun&quot; package) is large and operates well with the control located on the roof above the mirror. The cabin is attractive, but not overly luxurious. You won't mistake the Eclipse for a Porsche on the inside. 
	My commute is 150 miles a day so I get to spend a lot of time behind the wheel. So you may find that this review is not quite like the others which are usually written within days of purchase. I have to say that while this is a cool, very hot little car, it doesn't really hold up well when used day in and day out for the long commute. What's wrong with it?
	For one thing, even though this is a refined version of the old Eclipse, it still has some rough edges that start to wear on a drive of more than a half-hour or so. The driver's seat is a bit less than comfortable to me. The crude lumbar support Mitsubishi built in, hits a bit high on my back. The seat itself &quot;feels&quot; like it is not solid inside. Whenever I stop suddenly, something under my butt seems to move. I don't feel solidly held in place the way I should in a sports car. 
	The 5-speed shifter is sloppy and the distance between the gears is a bit long for me. The clutch is heavy and lacks the quick engagement I would like. Stop and go traffic with a standard shift is annoying under any conditions, but with the heavy truck-like clutch on the Eclipse, it is pure pain. 
	The cabin is noisy. Wind noise comes in from the hatchback and if you don't reseat the windows after opening the doors, the noise level goes up even more. On the plus side, the 4-wheel disk brakes are great. I have not been able to make the fade even under really hard driving conditions. The 17&quot; low-profile tires give the car good ground holding ability, though it is still easy to spin the front wheels on a standing start. The car handles well on wet roads, and has the same helplessness as other front-heavy cars on ice.
	There is noticeable torque steer on hard acceleration. This unpleasant quality along with the sloppy clutch and shifter takes a lot of pleasure out of driving. You could say that I am just too old for a car like this, but I don't think so. I think Mitsubishi is on the way to building a true sports coupe, but has a way to go before it is refined enough for a dyed-in-the-wool sports car driver. The old Eclipse was aimed at the power-hungry, flashy-body loving youth market. This version, if it is to be successful, has to gain considerable refinement to build loyal customers out of people like me.
	I have just traded the Eclipse for an Acura 3.2 CL type S. True there is over $10,000 US between the two vehicles, but just for the record, the Acura is faster, turns better, and is much  more comfortable than the Eclipse. Too bad it doesn't have that sexy red body. Oh well.
