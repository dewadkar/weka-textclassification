            We puchased a 1996 E350 Ford Econoline 15 passenger van to haul around our kids and their soccer/swim/Little League/Pop Warner football teams. The van has been excellent with the exceptions below. 

Love:  power to pull our heavy horse trailer; lots of room; great CD sound system; lots of air conditioning and heat especially in the rear.

Hate: no handle assists to get into vehicle; paint peeled off to primer; have gone through four sets of front tires due to unnatural wearing on outside of times (dealer unable to determine cause); brakes needed replacing at 74,000 miles; bolts were missing on some motor mounts when new; rear door stops(to keep door from going all the way open) fell off; had extended warranty which covered problems with heater, CD player, other mechanical problems. Very poor gas mileage (big engine).

Anyone who pulls a trailer and needs lots of room/seats should consider this vehicle. If you are worried about economy and do not plan on towing heavy trailers, get the smaller engine.<br><br>
