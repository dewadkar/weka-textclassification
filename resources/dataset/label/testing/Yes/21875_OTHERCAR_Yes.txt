            I'm still just as fond of my Outback after all these miles as I was from the start.  My first trip in it included a torrential downpour in Pueblo, CO and shortly after it took me through a blizzard in the Rocky Mountains.

At its 90,000 mile checkup it was pronounced to be in excellent condition. This car had endured not only all kinds of rough weather but muddy dirt roads, rocky roads, on steep inclines, sharp curves, slick roads and about any kind of conditions possible.  It performed well in every kind of condition to which it's been subjected,and the body is still tight. 
It has these little plastic covers at the base of the seats that came off and won't stay on but otherwise it has been a reliable car and a pleasure to drive.  The only reason I will replace it is to get one with more cargo space, but I would still want a Subaru.<br><br>
