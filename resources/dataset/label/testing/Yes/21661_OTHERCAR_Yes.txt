            Back in September of this year, I went to CarMax not expecting to find a luxury-level vehicle. I was surprised to find this car there, and at a good price as well. After researching for the better part of a weekend I went back and test drove it, and fell in love with the car. 

I'm tall (6'4&quot;), so it's tough to find a vehicle for me that fits. Usually, I will fit in a car but can't see too far above me, which is a pain at traffic lights that I'm in the front at. But this vehicle has excellent vision.

It also has all the luxuries I wanted, and more. The in-dash CD player is more than adequate for my needs (I don't believe in multiple-disc changers in cars, which are only good for very long drives), and the Bose/Mazda factory system in the car sounds great. The leather interior is spacious and comfortable, with power everything (windows, locks, and seats). The A/C and the heaters work very well, and the front seats even come with heaters which have been a nice touch lately!

We paid about $16,000 for the car, which was a good price based on the range and devaluation of the vehicle, so we purchased it without further ado. 

Getting a child into and out of a back seat baby seat is slightly difficult (mainly because of my height), but to be expected for a four-door car. Otherwise, the only other problem was the catalytic converter going south on me about a month ago, but it was fixed under warranty in one day, costing me nothing.

Overall, I've enjoyed this car and would consider buying a newer one when I'm ready for a change.<br><br>
