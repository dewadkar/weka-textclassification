            Hyundai has a reputation for building low budget, low quality, throwaway cars. This bad rep was earned primarily with their first generation ('86-'89) Excel, which was extremely trouble prone. Even though second generation Excels (of which I owned 2, both very reliable...) were much improved, the image is hard to shake. 

Of course once people who owned the cars thought of them as cheap rubbish, they did not think it worth their while to splurge on luxuries like regular maintenance. Current Hyundai models are rather reliable, as also evidenced by the 5 year/60000 mile bumper-to-bumper and 10 year/100000 mile powertrain warranty.

The Elantra was introduced in 1992 as a mid-level model between the Excel and the &quot;flagship&quot; Sonata. Over the years its engine displacement grew from 1.6 to 1.8, then from 1.8 to 2.0 liters. The current engine is fairly powerful for a compact car, putting out 140 hp. The car itself is solidly built, handling is predictable and sporty if somewhat stiff. The automatic is a bit sluggish off the line, but once underway it has respectable acceleration. Road holding is enhanced by standard 14&quot; wheels and tires. Road noise comes from the relatively wide tires primarily, although the engine can sound decidedly &quot;throaty&quot; when pushed hard.

Interior space is limited, and thus not very comfortable for those taller than 6' or so. The quality of materials, operation of switches, interior details etc. are far better than those on domestic compact cars, although they are still slightly inferior to Japanese competitors. The level of standard equipment is comprehensive, from air conditioning to tilt steering to power windows to tachometer, every major item usually thought of as an &quot;option&quot; is included. One area of slight disappointment is the finish of the trunk, where the carpeting looks very low-budget. The body design is slightly sporty and decidedly modern, and with its distinctively shaped lights, is a pretty cool sight in the dark too. With the car's price as low as it is, and one of the best warranties anywhere, this car is definitely an excellent buy.<br><br>
