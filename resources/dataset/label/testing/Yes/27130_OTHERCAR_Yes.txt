            This last year I traded a Chevrolet Lumina minivan for my 99 GMC Safari minivan. It was the best thing I have done in a long time. We take a lot of long trips and my legs would get very tired. Then my feet would swell in my new Safari I do not have this problem. The seats in the van are comfortable no matter where you are sitting. 

I have room for my family and dogs to travel with us and no one is crowded. There is also ample room for hauling things, the seats remove easily to allow this to happen.

My elderly mother travels with us and she was having problems getting into the van because it is higher than other minivans but we put running boards on it and made it much easier for her to get into the van. I like the fact that the van is higher, it helps with being able to see more of the traffic since we are higher.

We do not get as good as gas mileage in this van as in the Lumina but the other comforts are well worth not getting as good of gas mileage.
