            We bought this truck used about 6 years ago.  Back then it was in great shape, as it still is now.  

Our truck is a candy apple red, with grey interior, automatic 4-wheel drive (which helps in the snow!). 

Let me think about the history of this truck... other than normal maintenance costs (such as oil, etc), this truck has had very few problems considering it is now officially 11 years old, with nearly 200,000 kms on it.  Problem with the brakes once - break pads had to be replaced, muffler too, but that's to be expected.  Other than that, the only work done on this truck has been body work since it was starting to rust (to be expected from all the salt that gets put on the roads here).  

This truck is great because it is really reliable.  When I went to university, I had a two hour drive to get to where I was moving to, and I took countless loads back and forth in this truck.  Those trips weren't easy on gas, especially hauling a load, but in the long run it was cheaper than renting a moving truck.  

It isn't too big, in fact it is narrower than our car, and Intrepid.  I realized this when we built our garage; it's a breeze to park the truck in there, but when it comes to the car, it's a bit of a squeeze!  It's also easier to park than the car - not what you would expect.

It takes turns good, but you have to be careful that you're not going to fast.  This is a tall truck and the high center of gravity increases the chances of rolling.

The 4-wheel drive is great in the snow, especially for making a trail through the end of the driveway after the plow has filled it full of snow again.  We only got the truck stuck like this once, and that was after we were hit by a real bad snow storm; the pile of snow we were trying to get over was about three feet high.  On ice, it's rather iffy, and I'm more comfortable in the car when the roads are slippery.  The 4-wheel drive just makes the roads seem even more slippery, so cut back to 2-wheel drive if you have to drive on ice.

The two back seats are also convenient, but not very comfortable on long trips (take it from someone who has been there).  The back seats are also a great storage area, for a few groceries, or just some small items that can't get wet (in case it's raining).  It's also a great spot to put your dog!

If you are looking for an older reliable truck for a good price, this is the truck for you!  We've been told that these trucks are easily good for 400,000 kms if not driven off road, that means we are only halfway there!

And I just love driving this truck, I really like it and I am <i>not</i> a truck person!  


Happy Driving!
