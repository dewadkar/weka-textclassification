            I can not say enough good things about what Mustang maker's have done with the new 1999 35th anniversary Mustang.  In my opinion it is as hot as ever with it's new sleek design (with styling cues from the 94-99 Mustang which were highly acclaimed) and its newly increased power (up to 190 horsepower for the 3.8 liter six cylinder and 260 for the 4.6 liter eight cylinder) will get you where you need to go fast and in unmatched style.  Some have said this futuristic design is too far off from the old days of the original Mustang, and I'll agree that when I first saw the first 35th anniversary 'stang pass me on the road I was a little surprised with the new body but this new design simply increases horsepower (with new functional Ram Air Hood) and makes it even more fun than the previous Mustangs.  So the new 'stang is not just for Mustang lovers anymore, it is also for people who want a fun, sporty, and fast car.<br><br>
