            This is my first and will be my only review of a vehicle on this website.  Why?  Because I have a job, do not fancy myself to be an automotive journalist, and most importantly THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE THAT I OWN.  

The strengths of the Tahoe are myriad.  Very versatile in terms of passengers, cargo, or both.  The previous review, is, I believe inaccurate in assessing the cargo capacity of this vehicle.  It moves a lot of gear in my opinion.  Check it out at the dealer and see for yourself.  With the third-row installed, cargo space is pretty weak, but uninstall it and fold down the second row seats, and you have a lot of space to work with.  I drive with the third-row out and the second row in its normal position, and find that it has more than enough room for everyday needs.

Handling is excellent for a vehicle of this size.  I have driven several hundred miles in a 2002 Suburban I can say that the Tahoe is far easier to handle in tight spots.  Visibility up close to the vehicle could be better.  Off road ride is confidence-inspiring.  What can I say--don't buy this vehicle if you are interested in weaving in and out of traffic with the Honda Civics.  However, if you are used to driving trucks/large SUV's, you will love the Tahoe's handling.


Power is awesome from the 5300 Vortec, and adequate for most with the 4800 (friend has one).  Acceleration is again, more than adequate for a vehicle of this class.  I consistently take comfort in that fact--merging and getting out of bad situations on the highway are a snap.  Towing my 4000lb boat/trailer has been a dream in the Tahoe--almost too smooth.

The transmission is good--I am not qualified to rate it against sportier trannies, but it does very well with the 5300 Vortec.  Tow/haul mode makes towing a little easier on the transmission, or so I have read.  This is a tourqey vehicle and a heavy foot off the line is not the best plan, especially when unladen--you will scare yourself and those around you--remember your manners when driving large trucks; there are a lot of drivers in smaller vehicles out there who will really appreciate your taking things nice and smooth!

Tires are fine for now, but I will probably replace them with better off road tires at some point.  The Z71 trim level comes with bigger wheels and beefier off road appointments.  Believe it or not, some people actually DO take their $40,000 leather appointed SUVs off-road--I am one of them.  For that reason, I may upgrade the tires later.  The relatively low noise level (for a truck, mind you!) will suffer with the addition, or so I am told by a 2001 Tahoe owner...

Mileage is a CON, but only if you are hoping for car-like gas mileage.  The onboard computer tells me that I have averaged 14.6 MPG over the first 1000 miles.  I'll take it, given the size, power, and performance of the vehicle.  This is not a Geo Metro.  It is a full sized Chevy.  I was prepared to pay more at the pump, and I am willing to accept that given my needs and preferences.  This is something you must consider when shopping for a full-size SUV.  If hauling a family is your only concern, and you can get by with light-duty towing and zero off-road use, by all means consider a minivan.  In fact, I would not buy the Tahoe if you are primarily interested in commuting in a "tough" vehicle--it costs too much.  Really think about this prior to purchase!  However, if you can make use of it, go for it.

Overall quality is very good, if not excellent.  I love the leather and the Bose stereo--really makes it a classy truck that can get muddy and go out to dinner all in the same day.
GM fans will love the new gadgets and features included this year, such as the powerfold mirrors and the steering wheel-mounted controls for stereo, trip computer, etc.  I would say, however, that GM does not build to the quality of some of the foreign makers--I expect a few rattles and squeaks as she loosens up--I do not like this, but it has been my experience with GM (and Ford, for that matter)....


I wanted to address the negative review previously posted to this site...[rant deleted by popular demand]....


In sum, IF you are looking for a go-anywhere, take-anything and just about anyone you want with you vehicle that will be a pleasure to drive on road and off, this may be the vehicle for you. It is not cheap, and it is not "green".  However, for me, and many others, it is an excellent choice in today's market.  Hopefully the mileage and emissions will be improved in the coming years (all indications are that will happen...)

Good luck, and, if you'll excuse the pun, your mileage may vary......
