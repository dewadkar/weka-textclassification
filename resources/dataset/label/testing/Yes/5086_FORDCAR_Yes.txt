            The Taurus is a great car, yet, it's too small for my tastes. Why? Well, i'm a 6' 255lbs. muscular guy who has trouble finding cars he can fit in. This is on my list of cars I can fit in, but be very uncomfortable. My family owns one, and i'm always uncomfortable due to the small size. It's great for a small family with 3 normal sized kids, but with my family being 2 kids over both 6' and 250lbs, it's hard. We bought this car used, and it's a great car. There are many features and it's not that bad, but still, too small for my tastes. I sit up front, move the seat all the way back, and still feel a little cramped. Don't know why, but I do. So this is what I suggest to Ford, make the Taurus bigger! <br><br>
