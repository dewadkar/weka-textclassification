            My husband and I decided to buy our Sony Mavica this time last year in Japan -- the prices there were much cheaper than our (then) home country. Many of the newer mavica models were not available then.  Many people thought we were foolish, telling us that the price would come down if only we waited. But during this year we have taken more than 200 disks worth of pictures.  With the settings we use we usually get one long mpeg (moving picture which can be viewed on the computer), or 6-20 pictures.  The number of pictures varies greatly according to how many colours in the picture and more importantly, what quality you use.  I know that we would have taken many fewer pictures of our travels, family and friends if we only had a 35mm camera.

Five disadvantages I have found are that 

*I haven't yet found any filters or lenses to fit this in my local camera shops -- you can buy lenses from Sony for extra money. 

*It doesn't come with a case, you have to buy one separately

*There are times when a viewfinder as well as a screen would be useful -- high and low light levels mostly

*I have not found a way of connecting it directly to the computer so that you can take continuous shots that auto upload.

*it is bulkier and heavier than most other digicams

The Advantages, there are many

*It is very simple to use. My 3 1/2 year old takes GREAT pictures with it. Strangers and family find it very easy to use when we ask them to take pictures of us.

*uploading is even simpler, stick a disk in the disk drive and open internet explorer to view them. The menu has already been created by the camera, you just point and click with your mouse. 

*no need to upload special software (an internet browser is on most computers) or install leads. View your pictures on almost any P.C -- good for if you are away visiting or you use more than one computer.

*disks are cheap and very easy to get ahold of.  We buy 100 at a time and are on our 3rd box. We ran out just before taking a helicopter trip and the helicopter office sold us some at cost price. They had no film, so if it had been our regular camera or a digi camera then we would have been stuck.  You do not have to empty your camera's memory, or download the pictures before taking more, just slip an extra disk in.

*you can copy from one disk to another using just the camera.  Your sister liked that photo? Give her a copy right then and there!

*we just love the movie feature. They are low quality, but so easy to take and then send by email.  For Mothers DAY, my son and I wished my mother a Happy Mothers day and then sent the greeting online.  She received it a few minutes after it was taken.

If I were to buy one now, I would definitely buy another Mavica, if I could afford it I might upgrade to one of the ones with a greater zoom and more pixels, but despite that I would happily buy mine again today.  Overall, a pleasure to use and one that resulted in me giving away one of my regular film cameras because they are now so rarely used. 

Finally, I have never met a Mavica owner who didn't love their camera, I have seen them recommend them to strangers in stores.<br><br>
