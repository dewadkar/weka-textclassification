            The new Celica is positively awesome! First off is the looks, the car looks sooo good. Second is the Engine at least in the GT-S with 185hp out of a 1.8 liter is awesome. The 6 spd tranny is even sweeter. I have never driven such a nice tranny. The car handles great, and it's main competitor is the Acura Integra GS-R. The GS-R has been on top of it's class for some time, but there is a new leader erupting. It out handles, out accelerates and looks much meaner than the Integra. Reliability will be equal between the two cars which have superior reliability over any domestic car. This may be the only car out right now that I would give up my Eclipse for. I love it.<br><br>
