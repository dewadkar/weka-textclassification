            I have had our Intrepid now for over 4 years and I love it.  This by far the best vehicle we have purchased.  We were introduced to it by family members and we took theirs for a test drive and fell in love so within a month we started shopping around for one.  I like all of the different options to look for. First there is the standard and is it XE,  For our budget we choose the standard.  We had the option of 3.2 L engine or 3.5 L engine so we went with the bigger engine. That was my husbands choice he feels you got to have power.  We also have the built in child seat and I love that.  Both my children used it and the one still does. They both liked it for the fact that they don't fell confined like a regular car seat.  
  We do a lot of traveling since our closest relative is 9 hours away.  So I am pleased to have a car where there is enough room in the back seat for an adult.  I can sit right behind my husband and have plenty of very comfortable leg room .  You don't feel all cramped up in the back like so many cars out in this world.
  I am very satisfied with the gas milage that I get I usually get around 30 miles to the gallon on the highway and about 26 or so in town.  I fell with as big of engine it that is great gas milage.
  Besides the normal maintenance of routine oil changes and tires, we have had the car in once for service and that was for a water pump this last fall. I don't fell that is bad at all since we have over 95K on now and plan to keep it for as long as we can.
   I really suggest the next time you're in the market to buy a car to really consider the Dodge Intrepid.  It is a great all around safe and comfortable and great buy for the money!!!<br><br>
