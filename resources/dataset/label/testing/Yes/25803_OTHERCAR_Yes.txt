            If you are looking for a reliable sport utility vehicle, this is an option for you. If you are looking for an affordable sport utility vehicle with the ability to add lots of options, this is for you.


What do I love about the Amigo:

The size is one thing I love. Its smaller size makes this a great vehicle to drive in the city. The gas mileage is much better than most other sport utility vehicles also. The style is another thing I love. Its sleek, body design tends to catch people's eyes. 


What do I hate about the Amigo:

Since it is a smaller sport utility vehicle, there is not as much cargo space. The ride is a little bit more rough than the normal however this allows you to feel the road.


Who should(n't) buy this car:

This is definitely not a family vehicle. Its design and advertising is geared toward the younger generation. Single people. Now just because I said "the younger generation", that doesn't mean people over 40 shouldn't buy this. This is the Jeep Wrangler of Generation X.
