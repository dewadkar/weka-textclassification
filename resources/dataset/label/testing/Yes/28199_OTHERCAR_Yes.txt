            I have deleted my previous review on my 1999 Dodge Durango and rewritten it.

I bought a Dodge Durango in the summer of 1999. I was looking at Explorers, Blazers, and Durangos.  I chose the Durango because of the third seat, I have 2 kids and frequently take others along on trips. 
Extra space is very important when you take several adults and kids on long rides.  We have a campground lot about 2 hours away and also have family an hour and a half away.  It is really nice to be able to invite friends and not have to take 2 vehicles.  

The handling is the best I have ever driven.  It gives the space of a mini-van, the drive of a nice car, and the safety of a truck.  Turns are smooth and sharp.  I can park my Durango in the tightest of parking spaces without having any problem.  The suspension is comfortable, not clumsy like other 4 wheel drive SUVs that I have driven.  In the year that I have owned my Durango, I have had 2 friends drive my truck and then went out and bought Durangos also.

I am very impressed with my Durango. It is very easy to engage the four-wheel-drive and handles very well in rain, sleet, and snow. The dark tinted windows help keep the sun off the kids in the back as well. My Durango has every option available. The radio controls on the steering wheel are very convenient and the CD player sounds great. The leather seats are soft and comfortable, not stiff like others I have driven. 

All of the controls are within easy reach to the driver.  The back seats have a/c with separate controls and vents so the passengers in the back get the same comfort as being in the front.  Both back seats fold up to make one large cargo area.
 
The interior is well built.  My kids climb back and forth across the seats and into the cargo area in the back and I still don't have any signs of wear on the interior.

I have had my Durango for a year now without any trips to the shop.  Nothing has broken, no squeaks or squeals.  You do need to have the tires rotated with every oil change or the tires will cup and wear unevenly.  I have seen that happen on a friends Durango and the dealer said it is very common with all Dodge trucks.
  
Even without the extra options, you can't beat this SUV.  One of my friends bought the standard package and is just as pleased with the performance as I am. 

 The only downfall that I have found has been the gas mileage (only about 14 miles per gallon).
