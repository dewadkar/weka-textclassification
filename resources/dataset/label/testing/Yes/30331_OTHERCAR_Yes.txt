            My family owns two Acura Legends.  One is mine, its is a 1990 Legend that has around 130,000 miles on it.  The car still runs like a dream.  It never stalls or overheats and it is easy to depend upon for long journeys.  I have taken my Legend up the entire East Coast and back down again without a hitch.  It it a great car for teenagers learning to drive.  It is a smooth ride with strong breaks and a fast engine.  The leather seats are soft enough to sleep on. The car seats five people comfortable and the trunk space is amazing.  The car gets great mileage as well.<br><br>
