            I have had my '99 Mitsubishi Galant GTZ for just over a year. I'm still in love with this car. It's a head turner in an Accord/ Camry world and never disappoints me when I need it to GO. You punch the accelerator and this car responds without hesitation. Obviously the GTZ is the sports edition and has some little extras like sports-tuned suspension. The interior is very good and the comfort is the best I have ever had. I recommended this car to a friend shortly after I bought mine, and she bought one that is identical and loves it also. My only complaint is the keyless entry does not have a trunk popper. But other than that, I have been extremely pleased with this car. You cannot get another Japanese made vehicle this loaded for this much money. The GTZ only has a couple of options, like wheel locks, cd player, and trunk mat, EVERYTHING else is standard on this car. My Mom had '89 Galant and a '92 Diamante and never had any trouble with either of them. Toyota and Honda are good cars, but they are just too proud of them. And another advantage to this GTZ model is you won't see yourself on every street corner. It's a limited production 1,500 a year, and is only available in white, red and black. So you have a 1/500 car for any given production model year. <br><br>
