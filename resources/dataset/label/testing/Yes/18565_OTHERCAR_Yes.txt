            When I was looking for a digital camera I only wanted one with features that were competitive with my 35mm single lens reflex camera. 

* Good zoom capability

* The ability to take multiple photographs in a short time span (my SLR does 1 every 1/2 second)

* Complete aperture and shutter speed control

* The ability to be completely automatic, when needed

The QV-8000SX has all this and much more. It has an 8x zoom (better than any other camera I looked at) with 2x and 4x digital zoom, can take up to 5 pictures in row less than 1/2 second apart and has complete control over the aperture and shutter speed. It also has several other features I can't do without:

* A portrait setting that automatically decreases the depth of field

* A landscape setting that sets the depth of field to infinity

* A panorama setting that allows you to stitch up to nine pictures together to form asingle panorama photo (software is included).

* A lens that swivles

* A USB connection

It uses SmartMedia cards (an 8MB card is included) and can store pictures in either 640 x 480 or 1280 x 760 resolutions in up to 3 JPEG compression settings. Using a 48MB card at the highest resolution and least compression I can store about 90 pictures. At the lowest resolution I can store more than 400!

The only down side is that the only way to see the image you are photographing is the display on the back of the camera which washes out somewhat in direct sunlight (hint removing your sunglasses makes it easier to see the image). Also, since it has no eyepiece you cannot hold the camera up to your face to steady it.

I have already recommended it to one friend who is as satisfied as I am. If you are looking to replace your bulky SLR with multiple lenses with a lightweight digital camera, you should definitely consider this one.<br><br>
