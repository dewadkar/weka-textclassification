            After owning this car one year now I have had no problems at all.  The engine at 24,000 miles is still as quiet as the first day I drove it and the interior is holding up beautifully.  

What I notice most about the Camry is that every part of the car I inspect is high quality and durable. It's like everything built into the car is tight and going to stay that way for the long haul.  Also, we got the LE-V6 model which has a top notch engine that is powerful, durable, and whisper quiet. 

I purchased the model with the fabric seats, which are comfortable and built to last.  The controls are typical Toyota ergonomic with big buttons within easy reach.  Camry is plenty roomy for four medium sized adults.  As a six footer plus some I have a problem with the center console between the front seats that intrudes into my leg room.  Still, I found so many positives I overlooked it.

The drive is really quite smooth and quiet.  It is fun to punch the V6 and really responds for passing situations. The automatic transmission is seamless.  Cornering is adequate but I do find myself slowing down more in them than with my Honda Civic.  The ABS brakes are excellent.  It is true about Camry that road feel is lacking at high speeds but it can respond quickly for sudden lane changes and avoidance situations.  

I have a one year old daughter and I feel comfortable knowing that she is in the Camry.  For families who are not ready to jump to the minivan yet it may be the finest V6 family sedan available under $25,000.<br><br>
