                 I bought this car because it was small, and cute. I know that was a dumb reason to buy it , however , i feel now I made a good choice.
 The car is a small 4 door , yet it is roomy enough for four adults.
Mine came with a sunroof and CD player(Sony brand). I purchased the car new. I was impressed with the gas mileage (28-38mpg).I have the automatic transmission, yet I get to play with it on the floor.It has a button that you push for economy driving , and one for in town driving, if you figure that out then your gas mileage is terrific.It took me a while to figure that out , even though the car came with a manual and a cassette tape explaining the car. 
     I love my car, I get in and go as I please. I have never had any trouble with it,I can`t say enough about the quality of the motor.I have already put 60,000 miles on it and still, haven`t had to replace a thing. Brakes are starting to wear, I did replace the tires prior to vacation this year, just to be safe. 
     It is comfortable for someone my size, but not for a large person. I have a medium frame and 5`7. My husband is 6` and fits ok, in front, the back seat isn`t too comfortable, not enough padding in the seats, however there is leg room, for two.<br><br>
