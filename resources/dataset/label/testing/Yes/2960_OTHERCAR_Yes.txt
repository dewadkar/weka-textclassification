               First off, do not purchase this vehicle if you are looking for a replacement for a car.  It just does not work out.  Second of all, if you do not want to be at the gas pumps at least once a week, do not purchase it.  

   The Lincoln Navigator is great for what its mission is: comfortable transport for 7 people on or off road in style.  It is very luxurious inside with such features as rear captains chairs with a console, rear air conditiong, wood trim, and a rocking stereo. 

   On the outside it pleases too.  You know when this thing is coming through, it has SO much chrome on it.  The 4x4 Navigator is very capable in adverse conditions and for the occasional offroad venture.  However if you plan to offroad a bit and need winter traction, I reccomending replacing the stock tires with more useful All-terrain tires such as BF Goodrich All-Terrain's like I did.  On road handlnig was also improved with that switch.

Handling, as it comes as no surprise, is bad.  This is a truck, and a big one.  But for a big truck, it is pretty good.  That bad handling pays off with a super smooth ride, excellent payload, and a great towing capacity.  

All in all though, I love my real life Tonka truck :).
