            I have many friends who can't parallel park. Don't ask me how you get a driver's license without mastering the technique, I have no clue. But nevertheless, when they come to visit me on campus they just leave their cars in any old random spot and often beg me to move them to a legal space. It was during one of these freebie valet parking jobs that I got a little experience with my friend's '91 talon.(Please don't tell on me, I took my time finding a spot and had a nice leisurely, and sometimes not so leisurely drive, around campus.)

From the outside this car has always looked good to me. I like the sinister looking head lights and I like the swoopiness. My two main complaints about the styling are the ugly rims and the bulge on the right side of the hood that always seems to scream at me, "You'd be having so much fun if you'd just inserted turbo here, but you were too cheap or wimpy, so just live with this reminder for the rest of your life." They ought to put a flat hood on the non turbo models. In general, I never like it when a car has obvious reminders that there's options you skimped out on.

The interior is to me a lesson in functionality and good ergonomics, but also one in how good larger, more spacious cars can be. My first thought upon sliding into the driver's seat? "Ouch!" A 5 foot 100 pound female had been there before me. Adjusting the seat is fairly simple, with the customary controls for changing the distance from the wheel underneath the front of the bottom cushion and the lever for adjusting seat angle at the side. There was a good range of adjustment and I was easily able to find a comfortable driving position. The seats were some of the better ones I've seen in modern cars. Finally, some real lateral and lumbar support!!! In most cars I find my back is unsupported right at the base of my spine, causing pain there after just a few hours of driving. I felt like I could cruise all day in this car. Lateral, lumbar, and thigh support were all more than acceptable to me. Manually adjustable driver's lumbar support was welcome. The automatic seatbelts were not. I forgot and nearly choked myself when I tried to open the door and get out too fast. I've always hated the damn things on any car. And the driver's and passenger's lap belt handles were positioned not just to the side, but behind the seats, requiring a very awkward, painful reach back to grab a hold and pull them out. It's actually easier for rearseat passengers to hand the lap belts to those in front.

All gauges and climate controls were big, fat, clearly marked, and worked simply. I cannot comment on the radio, as it was after market. I thought the center console was too big and intrusive, turning what could have been a pleasantly intimate 'small car' feeling into a claustrophobic one. It was integrated into one unit that went from the dashboard almost to the rear seat and included the part of the dash housing the radio and climate controls, as well as the armrest areaw between the driver and front passenger. The portion between the seats got in my way and impeded my arm movement more than it helped me. I liked the way controls were tilted towards the driver and within easy reach though.

Upon startup there was no hesitation and the 4 cylender engine ran smoothly. I've been in a couple Talons and some examples of its twin, the Plymouth Lazer, all with over a hundred thousand miles on their engines, and they always seem to run smoothly for their age. The only problems I have seen are occasional coolant leaks and squeaks and rattles.

Noise levels at speed are OK. There is a small amount of wind noise. The coarse engine sounds at higher rpm's were most annoying to me. 

I didn't like low riding feeling in this car. It wouldn't have been so bad if everything in the car was low, but the driver sits low with that 'in a bath tub' type feeling, while the shifter and emergency brake were perched rather high on that bulky, intrusive center console, making me feel like I had to reach up to operate them when I prefer to be able to just let my hands fall on them naturally from the wheel. 

I have also been in the back seat. An experience I still don't like to discuss to this day, except maybe with my therapist. The steeply sloped rear hatch forces taller passengers to bend their heads forward. Legroom is also minimal, and that center console unit stretches all the way back to the rear and cuts down on rear legroom.(That thing's all over the place, isn't it?) the ideal is to have one rear seat passenger who can stretch their legs to the side. With two you should keep trips short. Or even better, save the rear seat for the small of stature or for storage.

The rear trunk area holds plenty of groceries, but more than a few day's luggage will end up piling high enough to block rearward vision.

Acceleration was anemic, another reminder that things would be more fun if that hood bulge actually housed a turbo. I wasn't impressed by low end, mid range, or high speed passing power. The engine pulled, but usually without much urgency.

Ride was OK. It was supple enough that it would take quite a bit for it to be jarring, but creaks and rattles resound in the cabin when riding over bumps. I could hear road irregularities more annoyingly than I could feel them. Handling was good, as should be expected for such a low slung car. The bigger tires gripped well, and it was fairly agile. The weak point in this package that moves it from sports car to sporty coupe status is the engine. Economy and sport modes in the transmission didn't help much. The sport mode allows the engine to rev higher before up-shifting for more power, but if there is no real power in the upper rpm ranges it makes little difference.

Overall I give it a B-minus. A nice, reliable coupe with a sporty image but lacking in sporty substance. If you go for that type of thing and want a fairly comfy, reliable and sporty looking car but don't need barn-storming capabilities, go for it. If I'm ever in the market, I'll hold out for the TSI model that has something underneath that hood bulge other than empty space.
