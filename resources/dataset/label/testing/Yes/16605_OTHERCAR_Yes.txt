            My wife and I have owned a Mitsubishi 3000 GT since 1995. This car is flat out quick even without the VR option. The acceleration is superior to nearly any other $30,000 automobile and the handling is very tight even after 4 and 1/2 years of driving.
    The gas mileage is less than one would expect for a small car with a six-cylinder engine but at least you can feel what the gas is doing.  The back seats are essentially useless for transporting people but are reasonable for packages.
     The factory supplied tires are performance based for incredible handling but to replace them be ready to shell out $600.00 to $1,000.00 about every 25,000 miles.
     We bought this vehicle to be a good looking performance based sports car and that is exactly what it is. I would not recommend this for anyone with a family since it is strictly for one or two persons.  I also would be cautious about considering this auto for a young driver because it simply is too powerful.
     Lastly you can feel the road as you would expect in a sports car and the extra power switch feature makes passing a zip. I honestly do not have any major cons to list about this auto after more than 4 years.<br><br>
