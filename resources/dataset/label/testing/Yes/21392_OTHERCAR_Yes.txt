                 Over the past 8 months, I have been driving a 1999 Camry LE with the I-4 engine.  My overall opinion of the car is that it is a reliable and conservative car that was built to provide a family-oriented mid-size sedan for a price under $20,000.  Toyota was very successful in designing a car for the above-mentioned use.  What they were not successful in designing was a sedan that would be the head of it's class in anything but reliability which I find very unfortunate.
     With the I-4 engine, the car averages approximately 23mpg for my use.  The layout of the controls is very simple and provides the occupants with many different options without overwhelming the view around the dashboard and on the center console.  The car is built fairly solid for a car priced under $20,000 and the steering is fairly comfortable.  The space inside the Camry is ample and is very comfortable even when the car is filled with 5 average-sized adults.  Trunk space is also fairly good.  The styling is simple, following the character of the car as a reliable average sedan.
     Although the Camry has all of these good points, it also has it's bad points.  The I-4 engine is adequate for normal driving and highway driving.  The pick up is zippy but the overall power of the engine causes the car to feel heavy at high speeds and unresponsive when needed.  There is a 6-cylinder engine that is provided and I do not have first-hand knowledge of the drive with that engine so you may want to check into that.  A drive through the city at lower speeds provides for a quiet ride that is a little more stiff than I enjoy.  I actually have a radar detector mounted on my front window that falls off every once in awhile because of the stiff ride.  On the highway, the ride smooths out but the internal noise is relatively loud.
     Overall, I would recommend the Camry (at least with the I-4 engine) for a more conservative, non-high mileage driver.  For the price, the Camry will provide unsurpassed reliability and value but for any true car and driving aficionados, the Camry provides no thrills and an average drive.
