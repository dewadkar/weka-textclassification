            Review by Irvin Pribadi 
Photography hobbyist. 

Assuming you've read the specs about this camera, here's my personal perspective as a common photography hobbyist. The good stuff first. The A40 surprised me in its ability to produce very good images especially in low light scenes. I can say that the A40 rivals Canon's S-series when it comes to low light photo quality!
Saturation and tones were superb and pretty accurate, but I also do think the A40's images could of been sharper and more crisp. I guess the autofocus and optics could use an improvement here. 

MANUAL MODE
One feature that the A40 boasts over the A20 and other 2MP cameras is the manual setting feature. This is especially needed when doing tricky shots, e.g. at night. Having this feature was one of my main reasons for choosing this camera over the Nikon CoolPix 2500 that was priced $25 more. 

It would of been nice if there was a way to view detailed settings used by the auto and program mode from previous shots. This would of been a good guide for me in manual mode as I found the LCD to be deceptive sometimes. Also want to note that the LCD, being hard to see during bright outdoor use, does not have any brightness settings. This lack of brightness is common among digital cameras. The LCD screen is easily scratched too! I just did with mine!

NAVIGATION AND MENUS
The camera lacks a navigation jog like some other cameras have. Navigation of menus are done by using for buttons below the LCD screen. It would take you a while to get used to the navigation buttons.

The camera mode dial to the right of the LCD screen could of been better. The dial became sticky and hard to turn when the camera was exposed to warm temperatures (90 degrees above). This should be an issue if you live in someplace cool.

BATTERY LIFE
A good thing is that being powered by AA batteries, you can get your A40 some good high capacity rechargables like I did. I bought the Powerex 1800 NiMH's and they lasted for more than 5 hours doing 200+ shots! That's more than enough juice for all day long shooting and uploading them when you're done. Battery life was a major consideration for me, as I knew Canon's S-series/IXUS would run out of life in less than 2 hours. One thing to note is that the low battery indicator is not very helpful; as soon as it goes off you only have a couple of minutes left to go!

3X OPTICAL ZOOM
The 3x optical zoom came in very handy. Wide view for those cramp indoor shots and zoomed view for those outdoor shots where you cannot always get close enough. Zoom capability in a way offers you a method to frame the shot to the right size. The camera goes up to 7.5x with digital zoom, but digital zoom brings down the image quality. I think 3x (105mm equiv.) optical zoom for a camera is good enough, anything below that is just not very useful.

MOVIE MODE WITH AUDIO
Another nifty feature is its movie mode. I could say that the A40 does not have the best movie image quality compared to its competitors, nevertheless it is still useful and a fun feature to have. Another draw back is that there is no audio during play back on the camera unlike Canon's G or S-series and the A40's zoom and exposure settings is locked during recording. 

GOOD SOFTWARE
One odd fact I found about the software is that it does not allow file uploads other than images. I know that Canon's S-series would allow this, making it sort of like a handy dandy CF card reader/writer. I'm still investigating about this as I'm sure that it's a software thing, not the camera's inability. Other than that the software is just sweet.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
All in all, I think this is a great camera considering its price. Please review and compare the A40's specs before buying. Here are a few things I recommend when buying the A40: Go get good rechargable batteries with a rapid charger. Go get a larger CF card (64MB or more). Go get a tripod for slow shutter/low light shots. All this came to about $100 for me.
