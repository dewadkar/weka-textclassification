            I had been looking for a car for the past year, going between an Alero and a Cougar, I decided to go with the Alero. For the price you could not beat it, the sporty look, the comfort and much more...I got the Alero GLS, with having a four year old I needed something that was roomy yet sporty, so with the two door, I have both.. With all that is standard in this car, you really had everything you needed, without adding extras. I would recommend this car to anyone, with a family or without. The best thing I have found with the car is the gas mileage, I thought with the V-6 that it would suck down fuel but I was wrong...great gas mileage!!!<br><br>
