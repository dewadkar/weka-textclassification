            I have found that the Dodge Ram 1500 Pick-up Truck is a powerful (with the V-8 engine) to be very powerful even when towing a load. It is very comfortable inside, full of power equipment (windows &amp; mirrors), air conditioning, AM/FM, Cassette &amp; CD player. It has plenty of room for up to six people, or with bucket seats 5 people. Handles like a car &amp; everything is convenient to the driver &amp; front passenger. Loaded with cruise, tilt wheel &amp; large rear bed it can be used as a family car as well as a heavy duty truck, it is that easy to drive &amp; has a comfortable ride. To complete the package you may add alloy wheels &amp; leather interior. It comes in either automatic or 5-speed manual transmission in either 2wd or 4wd, so you get a stylish, comfortable, powerful truck that is easy to use for your family of for work.<br><br>
