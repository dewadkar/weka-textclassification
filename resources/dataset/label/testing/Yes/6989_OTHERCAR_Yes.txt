            This review is more of a story than anything else.  The story of a young man and his first car.

I still remember the day this car was brought to my parents' home.  My father was in the market for a commuter sedan that could hold our entire family of six, and could be obtained on a budget.  As memory serves, this was my father's first brand-new car purchase, and I was nothing but a snotty ten-year-old who had decided that he knew everything about cars after one year of subscribing to <i>Motor Trend</i>.  In addition, I had a minimal conception of the fact that my dad couldn't just write a check for whatever car he liked.  So I was a bit befuddled by the choice of the boxy <b>1992 Dodge Spirit</b>, sans V-6 or supercharger, but it was nonetheless an exciting few weeks of test driving and my incessant nagging.

Looking back, and having inherited the vehicle for several years of my own use, I understand this decision.  Although the car was not always top-notch on raw power or absolute reliability, it fit its bill quite well: a fuel-efficient, lightweight commuter car with an ample helping of interior space.  By the time I gained control of the car, nine years later, it continued to fit the bill of a slightly worn out, fuel efficient college student's car.  And after eleven years and 137,000 miles, this car has taken its last road trip.  That's not exactly a record matching the Camry or even its more appropriate competitor, the Taurus, but for the price, it had a pretty good run of things.

<b>The Power</b>
Dealing with the 4-cylinder, baseline Spirit didn't exactly lend itself to souped-up street racing, but it got the job done surprisingly well.  Though the acceleration was hardly head-jerking, there was always adequate power in reserve for highways and on-ramps.  This was aided most greatly by the car's light weight -- around 1800 pounds.  Things would always get a little rougher when I was transporting my entire college dorm room home, but there was never any fear that I would be rear-ended by any bozos flying down the right lane.  And one of the greatest advantages to this car was one that I did not fully appreciate until I was a college student on a budget -- fuel efficiency.  The Spirit held around 30 mpg on lengthy highway trips, and kept at 20 in the city -- not bad for a midsized passenger car that offers no complaints running on economy fuel.

<b>The Interior</b>
Though the Spirit was available with all sorts of appointments in the upgraded model, ours was deliberately purchased with the basics only -- A/C, automatic transmission, power steering, a front bench seat (for the purposes of accomodating six in slight discomfort) and AM/FM/Cassette stereo on tinny little speakers.  Power <i>anything</i> was not included or expected on our budget, and not especially needed for a small-budget college student.  Still, the interior was impressive -- the backseat was genuinely comfortable for adults (even my lanky 6'4" self), the front seats were comfortable on 500-mile road trips, and the trunk and passenger space were accomodating enough to move my every earthly possession from school to home on several occassions.

<b>Maintenance</b>
Maintaining the Spirit was about what you'd expect from a baseline domestic model, only a bit better.  For the first years of this car's life, I can recall no major malfunctions that required anything but standard visits to the dealership.  Of course, what this meant was, as expected, I inherited the end-of-the-road troubles that marked this car's lifespan.  To be honest, it was a collection of small and large issues that contributed to the car's demise after some of its Japanese competitors are still chugging along.  The cable connecting the transmission lever to the engine snapped.  The oil tank developed a leak.  The four-way flashers completely ceased to work, even while the turn signals functioned individually.  The trunk developed a fairly serious leak, as did one of the headlights.  The interior driver's door handle came half disconnected.  The stereo ceased to work entirely (a broken power knob that required the whole unit's replacement).  And the nail in the car's coffin was a cracked head gasket, which had coolant dripping into the cylinder -- that, combined with a cracked windshield, put the estimated cost of all repairs above the value of the eleven-year-old econobox.

As stated, these sorts of accumulating costs are not entirely unexpected from a domestic car with this much age, wear and tear, but anyone considering an older Spirit as a stopgap purchase today may do well to consider them as a long-term factor.


<b>The Verdict</b>
I hardly expect many earnest car buyers today to be considering a <b>1992 Dodge Spirit</b> -- instead, this review is mainly a bit of a tribute.  Considering the car's economic price and peripheral costs, it made an excellent buy for the early-90s commuter on a budget.  This car has taken me personally through dozens of 90-mile trips from home to school, and on road trips spanning Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Atlanta and Montreal, among others.  It did so with minimal complaint, only showing its age at the time when it should have done so.  Now, the car is far from perfect -- for a marginal price increase (if one could afford it), one could own a Camry that would have a good five years left on its life.  But looking for something a bit more modest, the Spirit has worked as an ideal compromise.  The maintenance and powertrain show their domestic stripes after a few years, but most buyers are likely aware of this factor in considering a purchase.

So, to the 1992 Spirit, I salute you.  It's been a fun few years, and even now, as I toodle around in my faster, more luxurious 2000 Mazda 626, I miss you, in an odd way.  I learned to drive, in your driver's seat, in a set of sessions that were no doubt harrowing to my father.  I treated you to the years of my college life, where I likely put you through efforts you were never built to meet.  I don't care whose shores you were built on -- it was fun while it lasted.

My God, that was hokey.
