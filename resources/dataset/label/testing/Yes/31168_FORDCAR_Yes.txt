                Well what can I say if you are gonna go Ford go all out and get a Cobra Mustang preferably 98 or below because 99's suck!!!  I mean the body of all the 99 mustang's look like crap!!!  The 98 cobra comes stock with the mach 460 audio sound system which goes perfect with this car.  It also comes with 17 inch tires and a 4.6L engine with the ensignia of the people who put the engine together piece by ever loving piece.  My friends 98 Cobra came with the stock alligator hood.  It was cainary yellow with a black convertable top and the license plate venom 98 which suites this car perfectly.  This car has burned every continder on the streets from fellow 5.0's to its rival the Camaro.  This car is so powerful that the slightest tap on the accelerator and you reve up to 2,000 rpm's with the engine redlining at 6,500 rpm before cutting off for safety reasons.  The Cobra Mustang also has a place in the glove compartment for a Mod Chip that will disable the engine cutting off and give the car a little performance boost.  The car cost a little over $32,000 with no packages.  <br><br>
