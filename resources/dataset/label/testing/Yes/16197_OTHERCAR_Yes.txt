            Hi all,
Have been driving the Sienna ('99 XLE) for a year after selling '96 Grand Caravan ES. Loved everything about the Caravan except the leaking transmission and crankcase.

If only I could put the Dodge looks and features on the ultra-reliable Toyota.

Here is where the Toyo falls short (in no particular order):
- Ugly
- 6-way power seats (instead of 8-way like the Dodge). Very short people won't be able to drive this van.
- Dry Cleaning hook on wrong (passenger) side of van
- Front seat cup holders preclude optimum use of the space between seats
- Rear (way back) seat doesn't fold flat 
- Radio too low on console, if not for the steering wheel controls, it would be dangerous to use while driving.
- Lack of side-to-side controls for heat/cool. This is huge if you travel a lot. You should be able to cool the sunny side without freezing the shady side.
- Lack of compass, thermometer, trip computer (This is top o'the line XLE!)
- Fifteen inch tires. All vans should be 16 inch.
- Did I mention that it is ugly ! 

On the upside, I expect great reliability. The split rear seats are easy to manuever/remove. The van drives like a dream, plenty of power even when fully loaded.  The mid-cabin seats adjust (forward/back) to accommodate longer legs.
