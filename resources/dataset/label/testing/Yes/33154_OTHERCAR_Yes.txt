            Last week I set out to buy my wife a new Ford Contour, mainly due to the $2000 rebate on the 1999 model. After driving the V6 and trying the back seat, we made an offer on a car the dealer had in stock. We were informed that the offer was not adequate and a counter offer was made to us. 

I suggested to my wife that we look further before we made our final decision. Am I ever glad we did!  

On our way to another Ford dealer, we had to pass a Chevrolet dealer and I stopped in just to see what they had that was in the Contour's class. What we found was the new 2000 Chevy Malibu LS. My wife was initially not all that interested, but as I looked at the window sticker it was evident that the car was very well equipped and included several features that the Contour lacked. Most notably: anti-lock brakes, daytime running lights, AM/FM/CD &amp; Cassette player and folding rear seats.

The interior was very plush looking compared to the Contour that we had just made an offer on and it was evident that the back seat had more leg room and that the trunk was larger.

A test drive was certainly in order, and once on the road we were both convinced that the V6 Malibu had more low RPM torque than the Ford and it lacked the tire noise that we experienced in the other car. The ride was smoother and the seats were very comfortable.

When we returned to the dealership, I asked my wife for her opinion and she said &quot;Let's buy this one&quot;. Needless to say, our new Malibu is now parked in the garage next to our 1998 Ford Expedition. 

I know that this story is not very technical, but I want the reader to know that the product quality and features of the new Chevy Malibu LS caused us to break a long tradition of buying Ford products. 

We recommend this car to anyone looking for a V6 five passenger mid-size 4 door car. The 6 way power driver's seat allows my 6'3&quot; 250 lb. body to get comfortable behind the wheel and there is still enough room for someone to easily fit in the back seat behind me.<br><br>
