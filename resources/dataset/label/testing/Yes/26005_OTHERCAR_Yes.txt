            I have had three Chevy Cavaliers, all purchased used. They have all been excellent and dependable vehicles. The first was an '88 with 105,000 miles. I used it as an on-the-road salesman for almost ten months, driving over 40,000 miles with no serious repairs of any kind.

The second was a rebuild that had 38,000 miles on it. I put over 120,000 miles on it and the tires on the back were the same ones on it when I bought it. The only problem I had with it was blowing a head gasket when I put it in neutral while the cruise control was on ... duhh......

We now have a third one, purchased with 120,000 miles that I am using as a second car. 

These cars seem to go when even the 4-wheel drives are hanging up. I have had them in coal mines, construction sites and places I would not have dreamed of taking other vehicles.

There are only two inconveniences with them. Chevrolet seem incapable of making a small car with windshield wipers that do not freeze up while in use in the winter. GM is also incapable of making AM radios or cassette players that work past 30,000 miles.

Parts and repairs are reasonable, but you cannot do an oil change yourself unless you have a lift because of where the filter is placed.<br><br>
