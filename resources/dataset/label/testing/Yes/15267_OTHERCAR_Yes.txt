            The MVC-FD81 is the second Sony Mavica digital camera we've owned and we continue to be pleased with not only the performance of the camera, but the features that it offers.  

Since the camera is used for both business and personal use, it was imperative that we have the ability to toggle between high quality (memory intensive) and standard quality when taking photos.  The camera is simple to use, even for the beginner.
  
One of the features that we find most handy is the ability to view the photographs or MPEGs on any available computer with no need to install proprietary software on each. We just slide the disk out and view.  It couldn't be more user-friendly. 

A drawback of the camera is that when you are taking pictures without the flash, even if it appears that the lighting is sufficient, your photos are grainy.  The only time I use the camera sans flash is when taking outdoor photos with direct sunlight on the subject.  

With the many program choices, you can use it for portrait shots, action shots, basically any shots you can take with your standard 35mm you can duplicate with the Mavica.  Switching between the different programs is simple.

For the home user, the ability to record short MPEGs is a great feature.  I use it often to capture a quick shot for e-mailing to family or friends.  And the best feature for users who are using it mainly to e-mail photographs is that you can choose to have it take an e-mail sized photograph in addition to the standard photo.  The e-mail sized photo is a small file (usually 8 to 10Kb) and it makes it much simpler to send multiple photos in one mail without the recipient having to wait forever for the attachments to download. 

This is a great camera and without a doubt, our next digital camera purchase will be another product from the Mavica line.<br><br>
