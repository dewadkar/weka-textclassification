            I finally traded in my 2 door Eclipse for this 2 year beauty.  The Altima GLE comes loaded with a great ride at a reasonable price.

The car is a 2.4L 155 hp car that gets 23/31 mpg city/hwy driving (15.9 gal tank).  The GLE comes standard with 16 inch alloy wheels with sports tires P205/55 HR.  Some of the amenities are a 6 speaker CD/Cassette/FMAM stacker radio, leather power seats, keyless entry, wood finish trim, fog lights, front and side airbags.  In addition, the cornering lights aim a strong beam light toward the side you signal, so you can see beyond the front headlights and what you are turning into.  You have 2 cup holders in the middle compartment and 2 cup holders for the rear seats.  A center console has 2 compartments and change holder.  The leather seats and trim are great.  The passenger seat also comes with rear pocket for storage.  The visor has a electronic garage opener as well.  

The trunk is roomy and has a compartment the size of a half gallon milk container with a cargo net for additional storage.  

This car provides a comfortable rides similar to a luxury car.  My best friend has a 2001 LEXUS and this car rides as smooth as the LEXUS.  Although it weighs close to 3000lbs, the engine is powerful enough to pass and accelerate for the average city driver.  There is pickup when you need it.  At 75 mph, you begin to hear outside wind noise but no engine noise at all.  Turning and control is very good.  

The seats are quite comfortable and there is plenty of leg & shoulder room for 4 adults.  The gauges, especially the speedometer and odometer, and controls are easy to read.  Visibility of the road, backing up, and you side view is good.  

My favorite things on the car are the good gas mileage, a built in garage opener in the visor, and the engine stabilizer bar in the engine.  

The things I would change are the radio controls.  They are hard to reach when driving because the gear shift partly blocks your reach.  

Maintenance at the dealer is expensive.  A key cost about $40 to make and another $20 to program.  This is an ignition programmed key so even if you have a duplicate key that you had made at a key shop, it won't start the engine without the computer code.  The maintenance is pretty expensive at the dealer and most independent mechanics do not want to work on the car because of the computer chip.  It does come with a timing chain so you don't have to worry about it breaking while driving.

The car reminds me of Buick luxury, but with a Japanese dependable engine.  I would recommend this to someone who wants a nice car without the flashy outside appearances and the outrageous prices.  

Bottom line:  Best car I have ever owned, fell in love with it the first time I drove it.
