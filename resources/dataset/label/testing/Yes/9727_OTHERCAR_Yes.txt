            I cannot afford to buy any equipment when it just hits the market. I fear that later I would find shortcomings which I wouldn't be able to live with. So when CPU manufacturers came up with 80286, 80386,80486, pentium 1, Pii and Piii, I waited them out each time and after the chips had been tested and tried, I made my decision to buy, of course at reduced prices. Some versions I never bought, but skipped to the next issue.
I looked at the DSC-D770 for a while before making the jump. But I nearly lost. In a flash it was gone, and I could only find one.
I bought my DSC-D770 at COSTCO for $649.00.  I thought it to be a steal. I grew up on Rolleicord and Rolleiflex, Contax Zeiss Ikon and later other popular makes, including Cannon, Minolta and Olympus.
While I have read authoritative people declaring that those who tout the virtues of DIGITAL cameras have a vested interest and that they could never replace the 35-mm, I wonder.
With three film speeds (sensitivities) at the twist of a control, I find it very convenient to work with existing light. Factor in the ability to plus or minus the exposure on any one of those sensitivities, the camera is very versatile.
The memory stick was only used for testing in my case.  The 8-mb capacity was like buying a new car with one gallon of petrol in the tank. Therefore I moved to PCMCIA compact flash card adapters and 32-mb, 48-mb, 64 mb, 128-mb, and when the price went down, 256-mb compact flash cards.
When I go on vacation, I have no reason to take my laptop along for transferring pictures so that I have the capacity to take more. Five CF cards take up less room than one roll of 35-mm film.
By now you might be wondering what do I know about photography. Well I will invite you to see some of my work shortly.  For now, let me say, I was raised on Rollei's, of which I used every format until the Rollei 35 which I never had.  For 35-mm I used Contax and Zeiss Ikon.
Today I own a Canon Rebel 2000 and an Olympus OM77 AF, both with interchangeable lenses. The last two vacations were without 35-mm, just with the DSC-D770.
There are two short commings I find with the DSC-D770: The lack of inchangeable lenses is the first.  I recognize this short coming and have resigned myself to it, using its optical zoom and supplimentary lenses to make up for it.
The other shortcoming is that while I can take up to one thousand one hundred and fifteen photographs at Medium resolution on my 256-MB CF card, when I use Super Quality @ a picture size of 1344*1024, the camera freezes between 36 and 48 pictures. By freeze I mean that it does not write to the CF card, neither can it be powered down with the power switch.  The last picture gets lost and the only way to power down is by removing the power supply.
Please note that I believe, but cannot prove it, that the deficiency is in the ability to write more than the abovementioned number of files at the super resolution, on the card.  It might be a shortcoming of the CARD, but I am not qualified to say definitively which it is.
Meanwhile, I am very happy to use the camera in the High resolution mode at 1344*1024 pix size.
Well I have run off my mouth and now you want me to put my pictures where my mouth is, view seven pages of my work by visiting my website at the address below. Use the communication bar on page 6 to join me and chat about the camera, or teach me some things, I am a willing learner; or email me, using the appropriate button on page 6 and tell me what you think about the shots.
OH, by the way, I used Adobe Photoshop Elements to process the photos.  Enjoy the camera and I understand that there is only one available, buy it before I do. I can't afford it now, however.
