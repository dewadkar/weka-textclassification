            I bought this car used with only 3,000 miles on it, back in 1994.  I bought the car because I really needed a new one, and since I'm a small person this small car was attractive, sporty, and it suited me just fine.

I paid $9,000 for the car at that time, and I feel that I've gotten my moneys worth since it's still up and running as good as ever.  I've had no real problems with the car other than your usual maintenance.  And that, I didn't really consider to be a problem.

Last month was the only time I've had to have a major repair done.  I had to have a new alternator installed, and even that could happen to any car.

My car has 57,000 on it now and it's a 1993.  As you can tell I don't have to travel to much for my job.  

The car itself handles well, it's small so it fits in small places.  Considering it's a sports car, you might be surprised to find out that it handles great in the snow.  Living in NY, we get a lot of that fluffy white stuff.  

If you are interested in a small compact care that is good reliable transportation then I would recommend this car.  I get great gas mileage, and I can't really say I've ever had any complaints about it.

Summer time is great when you can take the T-tops out and just go for a joy ride.  

I don't think I could have asked for a better car, or a better deal.<br><br>
