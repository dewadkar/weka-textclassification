            Something is strange about me having a new car.  Growing up, my parents always bought their cars used, new cars being the toys of the elite of the middle class, something my family was not going to attain.  But after years of Buick Roulette and a lemon of a Toyota, I decided that there was one feature that I found very attractive in a car-- a warranty.

I only test drove one car and I was in love.  The gen-x as hell sales guy I had tried to get me to look at Mazdas as well, but I would not budge.  This sleek black car with a double white pinstripe and windows with the slightest tint was all that I could want, and the price was perfect.

It didn't take me long before I knew the perfect name for my car-- Porthos.  The wild one of the Three Musketeers, Porthos is the symbol of fun, of freedom, of high adventure on the open road.  There is no one more cavalier than Porthos.

Adventure calls me and my Porthos, and why not answer?  With good gas mileage and room for 3 friends and a car seat, there's nothing holding me back.  The trunk is large enough for me to carry all the miscellaneous cr<i></i>ap I want--clothes, books, toys, skateboard--plus whatever I else need to haul.  When I don't have my son with me, I can pull down the seat quickly and easily for extra hauling room.  

The car has best been described as &quot;zippy.&quot;  I have no problems with passing and merging, and drive up and down the curvy hills of Cincinnati with no hesitation.  The handling is beautiful and the standard transmission is so intuitive that I have only rarely stalled it, even when I was getting used to it.

Porthos is vain but cheap, as is my car.  Even the lowest model had tons of features, including anti-lock breaks, a AM/FM Cassette player, rear window defroster, and air-conditioning that kicks in quickly after starting the car.  The dark gray interior goes perfectly with the shiny black paint job.  The seats, even the back seat, are quite comfortable.

Luckily, my Porthos is only loud and obnoxious when I want him to be, unlike the Porthos of literature.  I have never turned the stereo up all the way, it goes so loud.  Even at the loudest I could pain myself to try, the sound did not distort.  The controls are somewhat intuitive, and are set apart enough that once you get used to where the buttons are, you don't have to look down to change the radio station or press rewind.  The sound quality is better than that of my Toyota's high-end Blau Punkt.

Most of all, Porthos always has a woman in mind.  The first time I sat in my car, I said, &quot;My god, everything is my size!&quot;  The steering wheel is smaller and set back toward the dash so that no matter how far I have to put the seat up, I don't feel like my chin is on the air bag.  The stick is &quot;low throw&quot; meaning I don't have to move far out of my reach to shift, even to 5th gear.  The seat-belt can be adjusted to three heights so that I can have it rest on my shoulder instead of around my neck.  I'm not a very small woman, but even my sister who is inches shorter than me commented that she can reach everything comfortably before asking if I'd trade her cars.  

Whether retrieving diamond studs to save the Queen's honor, or simply driving to work, I actually look forward to driving in my Cavalier.  Even rush hour is not a big deal when I have the style and comfort of my Porthos surrounding me.<br><br>
