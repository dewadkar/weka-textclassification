            I bought my 2000 Altima GXE in March of this year. I waited to get a good feel for this car before I was comfortable enough to give my epinion. So here it is. (Warning. I'm not a car enthusiast, so this is far from a professional review.  To me, cars are for transportation.  I don't get excited by the bells and whistles.  I do think that gives me an advantage when shopping.  I will not impulse buy a car.  You can be sure if I bought it, it's a good value for the dollar.) 

I needed to replace my 1990 Sentra when baby #3 came along. Due to the condition of the Sentra, I had been investigating smaller cars the previous spring and was waiting for the fall to purchase. I had settled on a Honda Civic when along came baby Rachel and any thoughts of a compact car pretty much vanished (so did any thoughts of sleeping late on weekends, but that's another review). I did all the requisite research, as I always do, comparing cars on Web sites and reading consumer magazine reviews and settled on the Altima as an affordable car with the potential to be mechanically sound and reliable. And it had the ability to tote the five of us should the need arise. (I use the car by myself 90% of the time for commuting).

For under $16,000 (including rebates and trade in of the Sentra, which I would have paid them to take) I got a car with a pretty peppy 4-cylinder automatic, power everything, CD-tape-AM/FM stereo system, 16-inch alloy wheels and 3.9% financing to boot.  In short, the best part about this car is the value.  You get a lot of car for the money and it's likely to give you little trouble.  I certainly haven't had any with mine to this point.

The Altima drives smoothly and fairly quietly.  And the pickup is pretty good.

The only drawbacks I'd mention are:

1) less than stellar fuel efficiency

2) not a great turning radius

3) the oil filter is hard to get to if you want to change your own oil.  And the low front end makes it impossible to get it up on your standard driveway ramps without scratching up the front end.

Good, reliable transportation, with a few of the niceties, for not much money. If that's what you're looking for, enjoy!<br><br>
