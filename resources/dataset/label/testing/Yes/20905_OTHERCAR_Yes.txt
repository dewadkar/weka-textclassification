            Last year (2000) in early summer, I had just gotten off some bad experiences with older cars, and my wife and I were down to sharing one vehicle.  It was time for a newer vehicle with a warranty, and my income was enough to justify a car payment.  I looked at a wide variety of vehicles under $20k, when we came across a dealer with 2 Cruisers in the showroom.  My wife and I loved it, and I realized that since I commute by public transportation, the wait for the car didn't rule it out.  So I put in the order, at $2500 over MSRP, and was supposed to wait for about 8 months!  At the time, I thought I might have to relocate to the republik of Kalifornia, so I asked if I could order it with 50-state emissions equipment.  They didn't know, and the call-back I got was from a different dealer, 5-star rated no less.  It turns out this other dealer was way better, and a friend of mine gave glowing reports of service when he bought a minivan there.  Not only that, but they could sell me the car for only about $80 more, and get it to me in half the time!  Their markup was $3000, but somehow the other dealer had padded the sale price.  Needless to say, I switched my order to them.

Jump to now: I'm driving the base package model in black, with only the sunroof group and auto transmission as options.  They all have power windows, but power locks are part of an expensive security/keyless entry package that I didn't want, so I have installed a nice aftermarket car alarm and power door lock kit.  I not only pay less, but have the ability to automatically roll up all windows when arming the alarm... very handy, wish they all did that.

The car is obviously gorgeous, and it's quite versatile and practical to boot: the rear seats come out or fold up, leaving lots of space to haul things.  I just recently stacked a bunch of furniture from Ikea in there, and still got decent highway mileage.  But the mileage isn't spectacular: you rarely break 21 MPG.  I've only just put 6000 miles on it, since I don't commute in the thing and own a motorcycle now.  The automatic transmission was probably not the best choice.  I figured since it had a hefty-sized 4-cylinder motor, it would do better than most compacts with an automatic, but its weight works against that theory.  It's not bad at all, but every time it downshifts to maintain speed on a hill I remember why I usually don't like automatic transmissions.  But most people don't like driving a clutch, especially in rush hour, so if you like autos, this one is fine.  Just pop it down into 3rd when you hit a hill on the highway.  Handling is adequate, but under a hard turn (even a cloverleaf ramp) you can tell it ain't no Honda.  It's noticeably top-heavy for a passenger car, but far from scary in the turns like an SUV.  And it rides so much more smoothly, of course!

All in all, it's a great car for the money; very pleasant to drive, great looking, and well built.  No real complaints except for the high car payment and insurance rates I didn't used to have. ;-)  I think I'll sell it in another year, just to avoid paying for a car with no more warranty.  The novelty is wearing off, too, so it's not as unique on the road as it was when I got it!
