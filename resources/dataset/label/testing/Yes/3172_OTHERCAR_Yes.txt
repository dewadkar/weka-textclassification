            I always liked the look of the Camaro. And I wanted to buy this car. And when it got to the time to buy a new car, I went to see a Camaro.

I like wide cars and the Camaro is wide. Its got a nice front end though I didn't care that much for the back end. And for the price it is a lot of car. The  car is quick and still turns heads. 
Although the Camaro doesn't cost much, its maintenance cost is pretty high. First of all its V-8 guzzles a lot of gas, especially during rough driving. Insurance is pretty high. Plus when replacement time comes, new parts cost more as they are usually performance parts. A set of new tires costs anywhere from $750.00 to $1,000 if your car came originally with performance tires.

It is a dangerous car though. It is very easy to lose control in snow, rain and loose gravel. Though its a fun car it should be taken soberly and one should be tempted into recklessness.<br><br>
