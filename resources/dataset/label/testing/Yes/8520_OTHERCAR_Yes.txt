              I have had my 2001 Ram 1500 2wd quad cab V8 (318) for 16 months now and still love it. I purchased the Dodge new for cheaper (16,450) and got more truck than the others could offer. I previously owned a Nissan Frontier, so I checked with them and there 4 door Pickup was about 18,999 to start . The Dodge truly is a work truck built tough, heavy doors and tailgate unlike the imports. I do not like the air filter set up it is difficult to change the filter out other than that I love it  still. I have had excellent service with the truck and only one repair on the AC when I first bought it . The AC compressor was defective and leaked from the factory fixed the next day and no more problems. I have a Chevrolet Silverado at work that is the same year etc, but it is more like a car. The Dodge has a taller more truck like stance, a more raspy exhaust sound, and the center console flips up and down ! The Chevrolet is stationary unless you pay extra .Also the Dodge sets up level where the other trucks seem to dip lower toward's the front . The Dodge looks very retro and also revives the old with the new and looks 18 wheeler tough and Solid . Well I still like my truck and have no problems to date with anything , but the new Dodge body style has caught my eye ! The wife trys to keep me away from the Dodge dealers so far so good . I hear the new Pickup is a total redesign again and has some real improvements . It should be a fantastic truck if it redefines the truck standards again.
