                I purchased a &quot;Kodak DC 210 Plus&quot; camera at the beginning of September, to be used on a  trip to Mexico I was taking. The camera worked beautifully from the get go. The pictures were clear and sharp, and the ease of use was excellent. The one true complaint I have with the camera is that the zoom is only a two to one . The camera eats batteries while viewing pics on the screen at the back of the camera, but with the included adapter, this problem is negligible at best.

    The camera was perfect, until I went to Universal studios in Orlando at the end of October. At that point, it suddenly stopped working all together. I sent it back to Kodak, they in turn sent me a replacement camera, that took only pitch black pictures. I sent it back to them, they returned the same camera to me, saying it was fine. It wasn't. I sent it back once more. They claimed they could still find nothing wrong with it. I finally e-mailed them several pictures from the camera, and at that point, they finally sent me another camera.

    Now, I'm leery of the camera. Which is a shame, because I like it very much. The pictures it takes are great. But to be honest, I'm not so sure about the workmanship and quality of the camera itself. I had a bad experience with a four hundred dollar piece of equipment, and it's not one I'd care to go through again.<br><br>
