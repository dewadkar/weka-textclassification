            The new 3-series sedans and coupes are all that BMW lovers expected them to be.  They handle better then any other car in it's class and has good power to back it up.  But one aspect which I think the new 3-series isn't better then the old models, is that it looks too much like a shrunk 5-series.  I'm only 22 and my '97 328i is my love.  I think is new look is too elegant looking.  The 3-series car should be geared towards a younger market but this car looks like my dad would drive it.  I personally don't think that the new 3-series is MEAN-LOOKING enough.  I old model 3-series was a car lovers' dream.  Cool and mean looking with the added luxury of BMW.  That's what I've expected from bimmers but this one looks too sissy.
Performance side everything is up to par with BMW standards.  Smooth revving in-line 6 with ample horse power.  I just can't wait to see how they are going to make the new M3 look.  A powerful sissy-looking car.  They have got to toughen up the look!<br><br>
