            While car shopping a few months back I was enticed to the Nissan lot because of great pricing and interest rates on the Maxima. However, once on the lot my eyes were quickly diverted to the Xterra. It's rugged good looks were impressive. After a quick test drive, I was sold and soon driving off with one. The rear seat is probably the Xterra's best feature. It is like sitting in a stadium or theater. The rear seat is a few inches higher than the front as to give the rear passengers more comfort and a view of the road through the windshield.  Although offered in both 2 or 4 wheel drive I opted for the 2 wheel drive model, mainly because I don't have much opportunity in San Diego to use 4 wheel drive.  Option's in my Xterra include, air, CD player, cruise control, trailer hitch, roof racks and brush guards. One of the main reasons I purchased the Xterra over other SUV's is that it is built on a frame design instead of a pan construction. While it might make for a ride similar to a truck, I feel that it is superior in strength and durability. The drawback with this type of construction is the extra weight that comes with it - over 3500 lbs. In order to move this vehicle, Nissan coupled a 170 hp. V6 motor with a 4 speed automatic transmission. A 5 speed manual is offered.  This combination works great for around town driving. But, after driving it on a few long trips, especially on steep hills, I feel that either a little more power or a different gear ratio is in order. The Xterra seems to work a little too hard. Clicking out of overdrive via a switch on the gear shift made it better, but I pay for it with a lower gas mileage. Around town you can expect to get 17 mpg while on the highway it is 19 mpg. If you are real conservative with the accelerator, 20 mpg is attainable. For an SUV, especially a lower priced one like the Xterra it is a very comfortable ride. There is a little wind noise that seeps in around the door seals, but not annoying. The Xterra is equipped with front discs and rear drums. I think Nissan would have better served this vehicle with a 4 wheel disc system instead. While there is no problem stopping, it feels to me as if the front discs are being asked to work to hard to stop this fairly heavy SUV. Approaching 15,000 miles in 4 months it seems like my family is never out of the Xterra. Other than regular oil changes, the Xterra has been in the shop for just one repair, the gas gauge. The problem was that it wouldn't read full when it was. Nissan promptly corrected this and we have had no problem with it since.  Driving the Xterra can be lots of fun, you just have to remember that it is an SUV when it comes to cornering. The SUV tends to understeer a little, meaning the tires will squeal if are going to fast or to sharp of a turn.  The Xterra is a great entry level price SUV and would serve most people well. In fact, after purchasing mine, my parents liked so much they bought one too.  However, if you're looking to tow a trailer or boat, maybe a SUV with a little more under the hood would be a better choice. <br><br>
