            I bought a 2002 Eclipse because I had a 1992 V4 RS that I had to get rid of due to the birth of my daughter. Now that she no longer requires attention while I'm having to manually shift gears, I have me another one.  I found the V6 GT to be A LOT tighter than the 1992 I had.  My husband and I recently went on an 1,100 mile trip in the car to far West Texas.  We found ourselves repeatedly dodging deer, raccoons, jackrabbits, lizards and any other critter that happened on the road.  The Eclipse hugged the curves, stayed on the road and responded quickly and this was at speeds of 80-90 miles per hour.  It is also quite a bit quieter with very little road noise or engine noise.  The clutch and gear shift is soft and quick.  I don't have any problems with grinding, while shifting, when I skip a gear. The sound system is nice.  My daughters car seat fits nicely in the back and I don't have problems getting her out.  I can fit more stuff in my Eclipse than I can in my Stratus.  I would recommend this car for a responsible, mature driver.  I would not recommend it for a teenager.  The car will flat get away from you given the chance.
