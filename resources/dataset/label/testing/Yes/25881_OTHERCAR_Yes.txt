            For several years the auto market has been dominated by the Sport Utility Vehicle AKA SUV. Nearly everyone has, wants, or is looking to purchase one of these rugged, yet comfortable machines. My family recently purchased a 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport with all the options. This shiny red beauty comes fully equipped with CD, Cassette, Air, Rear Window Defrost, Rear Window Wipers, Keyless Entry, Luggage Rack, and more. My father worked for Dodge/Chrysler for over 30 years, so was fortunate to receive a nearly 6,000 dollar discount on this beautiful beast. The Jeep Cherokee doesn't have a ton of leg room, but it does have a lot of cargo space, and is fairly luxious. Who can beat the overall look of it, though. It looks as if it belongs in an African Safari. That is what won me over. Its unique square-shaped body style and easy handing make this a true winner. Chrysler does it again.<br><br>
