            WWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW, is how I begin my first test drive of a Sebring,this car is St Valentine all wrapped up in two doors.
For years I sat and watched the Sebring go by wishing and hoping and praying for a miracle to maybe one day own one of these beauties.
Well my day came in January 1999, I sat in my princess, the smell of the leather, the ease of the controls. Just everything about this car appealed, its looks, its handling and comfort. Although a little sluggish with pickup, especially with a V6. All the other features made up for that one little imperfection. That I'm sure Chrysler will fix in the up and coming models.
I can honestly say, people will go out of their way to say nice car, men will whistle at your car instead of you, when you own one of these beauties. OOOhhhhhhh its no ego boost, I know but it feels nice that people admire your taste in a car.
This car appeals to the young and old, its roomy, great stereo and very comfortable.
I truly think that Chrysler, after the bumble on the Le Baron, has made up for that blunder and then some.

On the whole I LOVE this car, would recommend it to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Happy Sebringing XXXXXXX.
