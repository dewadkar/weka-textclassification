            Going to a Saturn dealership was a very good experience.  What was that?  Someone actually had a GOOD experience at a car dealership?  I've been to so many, I was pretty much jaded.
The SL2 caught my eye because of it's roominess.  The four doors makes it easier for passengers to get into.  I love the 60/40 seats, it can hold skies, bikes and groceries without a problem.  The trunk is at a good height, so there's no dangerous bending or leaning.  Another convenience?  One key opens everything!  It can be a real pain fumbling for your trunk keys, then your engine keys etc. The side panels are made of plastic, no rust!!  It also bounces back when hit with a supermarket grocery cart! 
The SL2, in my opinion, is nicer than the SL1 because the bumpers match the rest of the exterior color.  
The ride was very comfortable and quiet.
What I didn't like about my Saturn is that the doors did not have a rain ridge.  I'm not sure what it's really called, but all it is a plastic edge that catches the rain and prevents it from going into the inside of the car.  I had a '93, so it wasn't available then, but in the newer models, it's a given.  You don't realize how handy that is until you get stuck in a rainstorm!
The only other thing I did not like about it was the pickup.  I had an automatic, and the pickup left much to be desired.
Who should drive this?  Students (affordability), parents (safety), basically anyone.  There's also a two door version available for those who want a more sportier look.
