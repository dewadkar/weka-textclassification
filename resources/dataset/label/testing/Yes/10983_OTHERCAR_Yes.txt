            I bought this truck because my 1978 Ford f150 was getting a little frayed around the edges, I bought the Ford f150 new in September 1977 and it was a great truck.
So I was needing a new truck but, I wanted to pay cash for it. I only had a little over 8,000.00 in the bank so I was looking for a smaller truck.
When I found out that the Mazda was made in a Ford truck plant in NJ, I wanted to check it out.
To make a long story short, I found a plain jane, Red one with no extras and bought it, for 8,000.00 cash.
I have been very happy with this truck (but I do miss my bigger one). This truck is easy to drive. Goes a long way on a tank of gas.
It is a lot rougher than the the bigger truck. But I think more fun to drive, and cheeper too.
p/s
    This truck is Fire engine Red on the outside and Grey on the inside. It has rear wheel antilock brakes. 4 speed w/overdrive on the floor. 16 gal. gas tank, and I get 400 to 450 miles before gassing up. It has gauges for engine temperature, oil pressure, fuel, and battery. 2.3 liter engine. Uses unleaded gas. Variable interval wipers. locking glove box. no ac, no radio. does have a heater tho. It came with a real spare tire, jack and hood release.
     All in all its a pretty good truck. Out on the highway at highway speeds when I come to a real hill, must shift down into 4th gear.
 Well thats all I can think of now, but will update if I do.
