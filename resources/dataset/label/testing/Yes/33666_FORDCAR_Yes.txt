                 When I decided to attend a college two hours away my parents decided I had to have a new car.  After much searching and many sighs we came across the Ford Escort.  Let me just describe to you what a life saver this car has been for me, sometimes literally.  
     First, it has tremendous storage space and passenger room which is perfect for all the moving around and luggage I have to take home with me every weekend.  I have been able to fit an entire dorm room's worth of belongings into that little car with no problems.  I love the fact that I can get it all in one trip.
     Second, it is good on gas mileage which is a big help considering that I make the two-hour trip twice a week and that, as a college student, I am low on funds.  Another good thing about the gas is that it only take about $15 to fill the tank up from empty.  Thank you, Ford!
     Lastly, and most importantly in my opinion, is that the steel construction of the car makes safety simple.  I have been rear-ended, side-swiped and even hit a deer and ended up in a pond.  Through it all that little car held up so well that in all but the last case there was practically no damage done to the car and none to myself or passengers. When the deer incident occurred we were unable to salvage the car due to water damage but had been so impressed by the way that the car had protected me that we replaced it with yet another Ford Escort.
     So, if you're looking for a reliable, affordable family or college car, I sincerely reccomend taking this one for a test drive.<br><br>
