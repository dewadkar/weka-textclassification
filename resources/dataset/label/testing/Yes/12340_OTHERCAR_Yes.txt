               I did not buy this vehicle.  I have friend who is in my church who has recently bought this magnificent vehicle.  First the color he has is black.  That is a really good color for it.  Well, inside he has genuine leather seats which you could sink into.  He has a deluxe cd player in it.  When it plays the sound surrounds you and it sound so live.  This car can change from a stick shift to an automatic!  It is so cool.  You friend has recently up graded his speaker to two 15's.  Not to say that the speakers that come with it are bad or anything, he just likes really loud music!  Well I'm only 14 so he hasn't let me drive it yet, but I've seen him drive it, and I've rode in it before.  Let me tell you this car has got to be the quietest car ever.  It cranks then it sounds like it isn't even on!  This car has the top speed of about 140 mph.  My friend, so far has only gotten it up too 100mph, but he could have went a whole lot faster.
   I think anyone who like the sporty type cars and to show off cause it deserves to be shown off.  It is not really a family car.  It only has 2 doors.
