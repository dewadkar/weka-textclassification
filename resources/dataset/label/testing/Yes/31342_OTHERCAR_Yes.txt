            I fell in love with this car when I was living in Europe, and could not wait until I could afford to buy one. If you like to DRIVE your cars, as opposed to piloting a barge, you should check out this car.  If you feel that spending anything over $20,000 on a car entitles you to good handling, solid performance, high quality fit and finish, and an interior that does not look like a plastic toy, as I do, then you should really check out this car. I have driven everything from Bimmers and Alfa Romeos to an Isuzu I Mark diesel I had in college that lasted 185,000 miles before it got too damned ugly and slow, and I had to put it out of my misery. This car comes the closest to perfection of any of them.

It looks great. It is a modern design classic. No silly body cladding. No giant boy-racer wings. It is a clean, honest design. This car is what it looks like - a serious sports sedan. The exterior has a lithe, feline quality, like a cat poised to jump. Elegant with a touch of aggression.

Inside you will find what I think is one of the best interiors around. Like the exterior, the lines are fluid and graceful.  There is just enough real wood to make the car understatedly classy. The red dashboard illumination works well and looks good, I think. There are certainly some quirks, as other here mention. The cup holders on my 1996 2.8 quattro must have been designed by the Dry Cleaners Association - the only thing they are good for is spilling coffee on you.  The climate control works well but is not exactly intuitive. It is the one bit of gee-whiz electronic foolishness on this car.  The seats, though firm, are easily adjustable, hold you firmly in their grip, and are comfortable on long trips.  I have a friend who was an engineer for SAAB who always checks out the feel of all the buttons and switches on every car he rides in. He loves these. They all have the right stuff. The action is smooth, solid. The turn signal clicks into position with authority.  The buttons snap into place with just the right amount of resistance to let you know they will be with you for a long time, quietly going about their business. The materials for everything are first rate. Spend 20 grand on a Taurus or a Chrysler, or even more for the new Lincoln LS, and you can't help but feel ripped off just sitting in your seat looking at all the cheap hardware. The Audi exudes quality.

Then start the car and drive. The clutch is a little funny at first, engaging high. But it is smooth and easy to master.  The short shifter seems to magically leap into gear with conviction.  The old 12 valve V6 engine could do with a little more oomph. The VW VR6 of the same vintage seems more eager. But it is still plenty fast. 0-60 in about 8 seconds. And it likes to rev, passing wonderfully on the highway once you hit about 4000 RPM. With quattro, the car feels completely in control of whatever situation you throw it into - although you still need good snow tires if you get much of that stuff. The brakes grab hard. The suspension holds tight through the curves but also, magically, seems to provide a very comfortable ride. I can't think of a car that I have driven that was so good at so many things.  I bought this car used with the Audi Assured program about six months ago, and still love to just take it out for a spin. I volunteer to run errands with it all the time, just for the joy of driving it. It is almost four years old now, and it is still as solid and rattle-free as the new 2000s I tested. 

The back seat IS small, as some have suggested. But I have driven 4 six footers long distances with no complaints.  And the trunk is large, and has handled a lot of trips to Home Depot, thanks to the fold down seats.

This car is a jewel. It epitomizes what a sports sedan should be. It could be faster, certainly: You'll have no problem telling which model Bimmer just passed you coming off that stop light, if you are into that sort of thing. Especially if you have the Tiptronic. But if you really like driving, you wouldn't think of having an automatic anyway, right? It could be bigger. This is not the point. The A4 is not sports car. Nor is it a limousine. Itï¿½s a small sedan that will carry four people in high and lively style. If this is what you want, you should really consider this car. It's not exactly cheap, but it is a bargain. You can spend a certain amount of money and get a Maxima, a Camry, or a new Jetta VR6. I looked at all of them. Or, for the same money or less, you can get an Audi Assured A4 and still have a few years of factory warranty.  If you don't mind spending the additional money, go ahead and get a new one. Either way, I am sure you will not regret it.
