            First off, if you've read any of my other reviews, my previous car was a 93 Mustang.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  After getting into an accident last winter and completely demolishing my little car I decided that I needed to choose something bigger, and a little more bad@ss.  For one I would feel safer, and another reason is that I live in snow-ridden Syracuse.  After shopping around the used car lots (I am a poor college student), I fell in love with a 5-speed, 2-door, baby blue Jeep Cherokee pioneer.

I must admit it was the best purchase of my life!  I've had her for almost 6 months now and let me tell you, this car can go anywhere.  From driving through shallow streams to ripping around a dusty path it has seen some sights.  I have taken it on many road trips because of all the concerts I try to attend, and I average about 18 or 19 miles per gallon.  I feel that is not too shabby.  Another advantage that is pretty obvious if you have ever driven a jeep is the incredible turning radius.  It is a little rough to maneuver up the steep city hills, but not the Jeeps fault, that is just the downfall to being a standard driver.

Whenever I'm driving down the road I feel no shame being stopped at a red light next to a 99 Jeep Cherokee because they all look the same!!  When asking what year mine is, I usually respond with &quot;what do you think&quot;, and the answers I get are usually 95 or 96.  I definitely recommend a Jeep for anyone, with any kind of lifestyle, driving anywhere.  Of course a 4-door is always key if you get the opportunity, but I have no shame in my 2-door.  Not to mention, the comfy seats and perfect steering wheel alignment.  Finally I will note on the outstanding life span of these crazy vehicles.  I am up to 100,000 miles and still going strong.  Friends of mine who have owned jeeps have gone up to or over 200,000.  My baby will be around for a while!!
