              I've read some of the press about the lack of power and poor ride and seating position and I'm glad I bought it before I read these few reports. 
  I'm not a small person so room and seating is a issue. I've used this vehicle for 2 years as our vacation ride and I felt no more fatigued than when I drove our "luxury sedan". The power is good . I often travel to the mountains and I don't find myself having difficulty pulling hills on interstates at speed or passing. The gas mileage I get ranges from 17mpg in the city to as high as 19mpg on the road. 
  The rear seat is small but I don't carry adults in the rear seat often and It's not really that bad back there. There's plenty of room for a child seat and loading and unloading a child from a seat in the center position isn't  difficult.
  I recommend buying the bed extender it is useful for keeping items from sliding in the bed when the tailgate is up as well as extending the bed length with the tailgate down.
  The SE's audio system with a CD and Tape player sounds very good and includes separate tweeters. 
  The factory roof rack is almost useless to me. It's weight capacity is too low (125 lbs.) and it is too narrow and a little to short. I have canoes and kayaks that I carry that are 14 feet and longer. I added a Yakima rack adapter to the factory rack and adapted a Yakima rack system to a riser coming from my receiver tube on my tow hitch. It would be better to not have the factory rack and use a strictly aftermarket rack application.
