            Written in April 2001 Review of Trans Am:
(look lower for the Firebird I actually bought a month later)

I'm out test driving different sports cars and decide to drop by the Pontiac dealer because I'm in the area and I know they have a sports car. On the lot there are a number of sleek Firebirds and Trans Ams, bringing back memories of testosterone filled techno-lust from my teen years. Always wanted a Trans Am when I was a kid, what better car for a mid life crisis.

But I am leaning toward an import. A "real" sports car with a much narrower wheel base.  The Trans Am is <I>wide</I>.

I decide to drive it taking my 8 year old son with me. He test drives the back seat and loves it. Also says the car is great because it has enough cup holders.  Others have complained about the back seat being too small, but Micah said it was OK, and he hated the back seat of the 3000GT and Eclipse I drove later.  Those cars really have not back seat.

Other what I called "real" sports cars I've driven have been too short. Had too little head room for my 6'1" frame. The TA has plenty of room.

So I took it for a test drive. The first thing you notice is how hard it is to see out your mirrors. The side flare takes up half your side mirrors. The spoiler limits your back view.

Interior layout was nice.

Getting on the highway I found it was driving faster than I thought. Also when you punch it it goes. Now.

The base Firebird engine has more horses than the Porshe Boxster, though obviously in a bigger car.

When I left the lot I was against it. But now I'm reconsidering it. I need the head room and my kids need the back seat.

Saw an add in the paper for a 2000 Firebird at a local Pontiac dealer for $14000. This was a really good price and I went to look at it. Turns out the is their loss leader, the idea being you'll come look at it and buy something else. They won't give you this price on but the one car. I couldn't get the exact same car in white, I had to take the red for that price.

So I took the red.

I love this car. It is gorgeous. I get more comments on how pretty the car is than I've ever heard on another car. It had umph.

The Firebird has no spoiler in the back, so seeing out the back is much easier.

I wish the base had power locks and windows, but I can live with out them for the price.
