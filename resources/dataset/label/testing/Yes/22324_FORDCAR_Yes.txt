                    I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.

       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

     The Ford Expedition is a case of the Ford Motor Company FINALLY heading in the proper direction. Based on the re-designed explorer suspension, but on a grander scale, the Expedition has proved to me from underneath that it means business.

     The old explorer chassis was based on the front ends of old, twin I-Beans and coil springs,(can you say 1960's ?) Ford decided enough was enough and gave their front suspension a complete overhaul and nailed it. Now underneath it sports a more modern and reasonable SLA suspension. Upper and lower control arms, and not coil springs, but torsion bars.

    What this means for you is a more predictable steering feel and a much more comfortable ride. Though it is still technically a &quot;truck&quot; it will just feel like a really huge car, and command more respect than any grocery getter.

    Though nothing parts wise in the front end is greasable from the factory Ford must have done their homework again, because I don't see an unbalanced number of these as of yet returning to the shop for steering/ suspension parts replacement due to premature wear out.

    The springing of this front end I especially like because of the afore mentioned torsion bars. What this simply is, is instead of coil springs between the control arms, it is a longitudinally mounted round bar of extremely heavy duty spring steel. It mounts to the frame on one end and into the control arm on the other end. as the &quot;spring&quot; weakens, like every single one will do, it simply requires a turn of a bold to &quot;re-energize&quot; the bar.  Add some tension and the ride height is back to factory spec.

    They also did their homework on alignment capabilities. In times of old, you needed special kits to align any Ford front end, from lack of factory adjustment, but with the Expedition, you have a slotted upper control arm system and alignment cams to dial it into factory settings. One caveat here though. Some of the front ends come with different cam systems, 3 in all, so yours may not be completely adjustable and may still see a need to replace this with a more adjustable set. I have even seen a couple with no cams at all, but just a straight bolt which allows no adjustment.

    The expedition also comes with a very impressive Anti sway bar system. Most vehicles sport just enough to get by, unless it is some kind of sport option, but the Expedition has a massive set of bars, which keep things leveled out in cornering.

    All in all the Expedition looks Ford tough underneath, truly not just like the jingle. This is one Ford that does not come under the category of &quot;Fix Or Repair Daily&quot;. It will get the job done right, and will give you some satisfaction and piece of mind.<br><br>
