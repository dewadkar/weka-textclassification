            OK, I may be a little late in the game at reviewing this car, but I felt that I needed to share my experiences with this car as I'm the proud new owner of my first convertible.  I picked up my Champagne Pearl Sebring Convertible on August 23rd and have not regretted it ever since.  But before I continue, allow me to provide a little history.....

My first car ever was a used 1977 Chrysler Newport that I purchased from my high school football coach back in 1986.  I was 16 at the time.  That beast of a vehicle will always hold a special place in my heart as I did everything in that car. It was the car that everyone in H.S. piled into to go to lunch, to team practices and just about everything else.  It was the car that in the Winter, it plowed right along while many others would get stuck in those Upstate NY blizzards.  Truly a worthy piece of machinery.

Or course, I did have my dream car back then.  For whatever reason, I had always wanted a convertible Chrysler LeBaron Turbo.  Always loved the look of the styling and wanted a convertible.  Sadly, after the Newport, I went with 2 other American vehicles (Pontiac Grand AM and Grand Prix) and lost all desire to want an American made car ever again.  

Fast forward to February 2003.  I decide to try an American made car once again.  I was really looking for a Pontiac Vibe as it was a really neat idea at the time and I loved the styling and the features.  Luckily, and I say it as such, I didn't get the interest rate I wanted and decided to stick with my trusty 1991 Honda CRX with over 180k miles on it.  

Now, I know this is getting lengthy, but I'm coming to the my review very soon.  On August 9th, I went to my local Chrysler-Jeep dealer as I had received pre-approved financing (at a great rate) from my finance company. I drove off the lot with a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder.  I thought I was set and I had my convertible finally.  Needless to say, my finance company didn't finance that model of vehicle (along with several others), so I returned that car after 2 weeks and got my 2001 Sebring convertible.

I have NOT looked back ever since. If I get one more person telling me how nice this car looks or how sweet my new 'ride' is, I don't know what I'll do.  This past weekend, I was at a Chrysler dealership picking up some floor mats that I had ordered.  I had my car sitting in the lot with the top down, freshly detailed not even 15 minutes prior to that.  I come out to my car to find a guy looking at it.  He complimented me on the vehicle and mentioned how he was actually trying to buy it before one of the salesman explained that it was a customer car.  What better compliment can I receive?

This car is everything I would have hope my LeBaron dream car would have been and oh so much more.  I'm a 34 year old male and for the first time, I feel like a true adult when driving such a refined automobile that turns so many heads.  The car has beautiful styling and is so much more road friendly than the Spyder that I owned for 2 weeks.  Everything from the back seat room to the stereo to the powered top itself is such an improvement on the Mitsu convertible.  This is truly (in my honest opinion) probably the best made convertible on the market today.

The 200hp V6 2.7l engine is MORE than capable here on the Florida highways.  Merging onto the highways here that are mixed between locals and tourists, I can get on and slide right into traffic.  Some people worry about the rear vision.  Yes, it is somewhat limited, but not as bad as it was in the Spyder and heck, I'm in Florida.  My top will be down most of the year (except for those 2 weeks of cold weather in February!)  No complaints here on the vision.

The drive has to be one of the smoothest I've ever had in a vehicle.  I've had the opportunity to drive plenty of cars here as I was a valet at one of the popular resorts here, but I must say the ride in my Sebring rates up there with cars costing twice as much.  Smooth and comfortable on the long 30 mile drives to and from work, yet nimble enough on the corners in my winding neighborhood.  I have the LX, which is apparently the base model, but other than fog lights, the superior leather interior, and the trip computer, I have everything else including the 4 wheel anti-locking disc brakes, which I'm sure contributes to the smooth braking.  

Honestly, I have come to depend on the reviewers here on Epinions.com and I read the Spyder reviews AFTER buying the vehicle and was somewhat disappointed, but read the reviews on the Sebring PRIOR to having to turn in my Mitsu.  Let me say that I was more than impressed by the raves the Sebring received and wholeheartedly back up every praise thrown its' way.  I love this car and have no regrets (other than  I waited this long to buy one!!)
