            I have used a Minolta SLR 35mm camera for years, so I guess I was pre-disposed to the brand name, but I entered the digicam world with reservations.  I am a techie by disposition and trade and I have no fear of the digital world, but I was convinced that no digicam available today could compete with 35mm analog film.  I was wrong.

This camera goes way beyond my expectations (I received it as a gift) and should have the 35mm world (especially those overpriced film developing labs) worried for their future.

The "point and shoot" (auto mode) feature makes this camera a no brainer for those who don't want to experience any learning curve, but I get some inconsistent results.  Certain times, for example, if I take a photo in auto mode at night in my living room, I may get a picture with a yellowish tint; a few minutes later, the picture may be fine.  I'm not sure what's causing this;  it could be the processor is making some assumptions due to the angle of the shot and its relative position to ambient room light from one shot to the next -- I don't know.  However, inconsistency is a common problem in amateur 35mm analog photography as well.

Lately, I've been experimenting with the manual mode options and I am delighted with the results (both quality and consistency).  This is an incredibly feature-rich camera!  I have been able to do things with this camera by experimenting for a few minutes that took me years to learn using a 35mm SLR.  I even took a picture of rain running down a window from inside my office on a cloudy day under fluorescent lights and it turned out beautifully!

This camera is well worth the $450 price tag.  I can't recommend it highly enough, despite the inconsistencies in auto mode.  I'm not egomaniacal enough to think my auto mode problems couldn't be something I'm doing wrong.
