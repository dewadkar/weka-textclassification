            I traded in my 96 Honda Civic for a 1999 Honda Accord. I love this car! After the birth of my son, my husband and I realized our Civic was getting kind of cramped with all our baby equipment. We knew we needed something a little larger but we weren't ready to go SUV yet. ( The Expedition will come next year!) We decided not to stray from Honda.The Accord was the perfect answer. From the moment I sat in this car, I knew I loved it. The seats were roomy and comfortable, the stereo was premium (very important to me because I like to play it loud), and best of all, the back seat was large enough for my son, his gigantic car seat and his menagerie of stuffed animals that seem to follow us everywhere we go. I have had the Accord for about 7 months now and aside from getting the oil changed and tires rotated, it has never been in the shop. It runs as good as the first day I bought it. We went for the EX version but there are two other models for you to choose from, the LX and DX. Our EX is an Automatic with power everything as well as a 6 disk CD Changer, a moonroof and leather seats. I highly recommend the Honda Accord for anyone who likes to drive in cool, comfortable style. <br><br>
