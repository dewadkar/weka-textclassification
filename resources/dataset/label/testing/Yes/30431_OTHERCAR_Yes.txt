              This is a good car for families with small children or for young first time  carbuyers. It's compact enough to fit tight spaces but big enough inside to hold 4 in reasonable comfort, and five can even survive for short trips. Our 97 CE has gone 60,000 miles without any problems that my and my fathers' leadfooted, aggressive driving did not cause. Cost of maintenance and upkeep is extremely low, and fuel economy is great. But it is an import car so if anything does go seriously wrong, parts can get expensive. That new clutch cost us almost 1000 dolars.
 But the likelihood of costly repairs with this car is very low. 

 Handling is safe and competent, but no more. Don't expect it to be fun like a Protege or Neon. The tires squeal pretty early in hard corners, but the body doesn't roll much and it's very agile. But expect it to trump both competitors in quality. No rattles to speak of, and nothing has fallen off. The four banger makes only 105 hp and 117 pounds of torque, and for those of you who dont know what that means, those numbers aren't impressive. Power does not come as soon as you put your foot on it. This engine builds steam very slowly from low rpm's. Floor it, the car starts off slow and then the revs start to build, so it's pulling hard enough to get you in and out of traffic in the upper rpm ranges. Unforunately I can't give you exact optimum rpms for power because Toyota for some reason did not see fit to put a tachometer in this car, something I find inexcusable in a car with a manual transmission.
  
    But as with any car, you can make every one of those horsies work it's ass of with a 5 spd manual. Automatics in economy cars upshift before the engine revs high enough to make real power and are slow to downshift, and even once they have downshifted there still isn't much there. But with a stickshift, this car's acceration is elevated from anemic to pretty darn perky. One thing I love about it that I can't say about the Ranger, I can actually feel the engine pull in 5th gear!!! Don't get me wrong, the speedo doesn't move in leaps and bounds but it can pick up speed without me having to downshift constantly on the highway and wear the clutch more.

  For putting on sudden bursts of speed you'll need a lower gear(and maybe a more flexible definition of what 'sudden' means.) But  if there's noone coming behind you soon in the fast lane and you have maybe 7-8 seconds or so you'll make it from 60-75 in fair time without downshifting. I guess it's the gearing.
 
  I've chirped the tires quite a few times myself.But the shifter is not very satisfying. It's loose and rubbery, with too much free play in the gears. It moves through the gears very smoothly, it's just not tight enough.
 
   Braking is OK but not great, stops are well controlled but long.
Ride is pretty good. It takes the small bumps well but the suspension clunks solidly over the big ones. When the bumps come pretty far apart ou hear them more than feel them, with just a soft 'womp' every now and then. When they come close together is when the car is easily upset. You can hear a little tire groan, a little wind noise, and a little enine wine, not enough of each to really be annoying but combined it can get tiresome when you've been driging for awhile.
 
  On interior space, the front passengers can be a little cramped so those in the rear have more space, or vice versa, but one way or the other if it's all average sized adults someone will end up a little uncomfortable. The rearseat can hold two adults or three small children. I'm not too fond of the front buckets, which don't offer much lumbar support. A small folding armrest would be nice. 
 
   There isn't much wind noise at highway speed, but the small engine has to work hard to keep it at speed so you hear some engine whine, but not an intolerable amount. The trunk holds a suprising amount for a compact. It's swallowed everything we've ever needed it to for long trips.

  One major annoyance is that both power side view mirrors cannot be controlled from the driver's seat. The switch for the driver's mirror is on that B pillar and the switch for the passenger side mirror is on the passenger side B-pillar, so you have to stretch from the driver's seat to adjust the passenger side mirror. No adjusting these things on the fly. Have them set before you get going. Kind of defeats much of the purpose of power mirrors, don't you think? You might as well save the money and get manually adjusted ones.  The front door armrests should be just a little bit higher.
  
   Toyota stereos, espcial in pre 98 corollas, have never been exceptional. If you want really high quality sound do what my family did. Get the cheapest sound system from the factory then upgrade later. 
The best thing about the car is its quality, reliability, and overall refinement. One bad point: toyota dealers in general can be asswholes to deal with whether it's buying or servicing.

Update!!!!
5/25/00
  This car has been almost mechanically flawless aside from the excessive wear and tear caused by the agressive driving habbits of the men in our family. A new clutch at 56,000 miles set us back 1200 dollars. We've also had one brake job. That is about all this car has needed outside of routine maintenance. One thing I'll say for this car and imports in general is that they're pretty reliable but when things do go wrong parts can set you back quite a bit.
 
   The interior has held up well. The manual shifter has become looser and more rubbery with time. Toyota shifters could definitely use improvement. They feel loose and jiggely from the factory and only get worse with time. Other than that everything is fine. This car has been Colorado once, on several two hour drives to Maryland, to New York, to the Poconos, and has never once hesitated to do what it was asked, though we have the dubious distinction of having had a breakdown on every single vacation we took with our other cars. It's kind of refreshing to know we'll get there without trouble this time around.
 
   The finish is fine, as one would expect for only 3 years, and I assume it will be fine for quite some time, as Toyota finishes tend to be very durable. The shine is just not as deep as in some other cars. 
 
  The tires have also been replaced, again due to our road racer delusions. We had to give up the Goodyear Invicta's, which were no longer made. The new ones seem to make a little more noise. It escapes me at the moment what brand they are, I think other Goodyears.
  
  The power windows and locks are still functioning properly, which goes to show my parents the expense was worth the convenience despite their worries that too many power accessories means more will break.
  
  The steering is also a little too light and jittery at high speeds, it could use some more weight. And of course fuel economy is a plus. I haven't looked at range yet but it's only 15$ for a fillup and it only needs gas every 10-15 days. Gas crisis? What gas crisis?
