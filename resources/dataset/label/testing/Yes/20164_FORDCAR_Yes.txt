            As always when I open the doors all the snow or rain ends up on the seats. Could the designers not prevent this? I love the power of the motor but it is noisy. I had a 98 Windstar which took a long time to warm up- Dealer said it was because of extra cooling capacity. They now say the 2000 does not warm up, as we would like because ,as it is tipical of all Vans and no thermostat is available to help. So I put a 10 cent peice of cardboard infront of the rad. and it works........The spare tire carier is hard to use as the Jack handle which is required to lower the tire hits the inside of the van and marks it. I find too that a sparkplug change is yery very costly and a transmition tune up at 60000km will cost me about  $100.00. This is OK but my whole purchase of a new van, with lesser options, was based on the fact I would have no maintence!!!!!11<br><br>
