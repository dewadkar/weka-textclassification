            This camera is crazy.  I had been looking for reviews on this thing and they are impossible to find, so here is my review.  I purchased mine at radio shack and it was the only one they had in stock.  I dont think however that they were suppose to sell that unit, but whatever.  
Put simply, this camera is amazing.  The picture quality is excellent and the software that accompanies the camera is excellent too.  The sepia and monochrome pictures are fun to play with and the red eye setting is fantastic. With a 256MB card I can take 150 of the best setting shots, on the worst setting I can take 2500.  Of the 400+ shots I have taken, only 2 have been blurry, but this was because i had the camera set to light bulb setting and I was taking pictues in a Flourescent light setting, so watch out,  other than that none have been blurry and all have come out great.  The 4x's digital zoom is ony good if you have the highest quality settings, then the pictures are fine.  With lower setting, the pics become very grainy.  
The startup time of this camer from power on till time the shot is ready is under a second. 
The menus are so easy to understand, the lcd is huge and is fun to show all your friends at the bars.  The videos are pretty pixilated though, but the sound capabilities make up for it, you can get the general ideas.  
The metal casing is hella sturdy.  I dropped the camera the second day I had it onto a cement floor in a hotdog shop one night when i was drunk and the thing did not even get scratched.  
The batteries last very very very long compared to my old FujiFinepix 2650 which is not a cool camera. 
The best thing about this camera is the bar ability.  I have so many random shot of my friends and with this camera, they are willing to stop and pose for the camera.  Plus, when you pull it out of your pocket, its a conversation starter.  Go get one of these things. 

Some additional info from me to you:

You can purchase one at www.nightowlcamera.com for $227 and get a 256 mb card for $65 off ebay.
