            When my husband and 2.5-yr-old son were t-boned in our 4-Runner last January, we had to buy a new vehicle.

We were very happy with the way the 4-Runner held up in the accident (no injuries, even though it was totalled), and since we know a great Toyota mechanic, we pretty much limited our options to Toyota right away. Also, even though we had been thinking about trading the 4-Runner for a Corrolla or other normal-size car, the accident taught us that being higher off the ground was a big safety plus (if DH had been driving my Corrolla instead, he would have been killed because the other vehicle would have hit him in the side and shoulder instead of at the floor-board level). 

We were impressed with the Highlander right away. It really feels more like a car than a truck -- in fact, when we first bought it, we had trouble not speeding on the Interstate because the thing is so smooth, you don't even realize you're going 80 mph. The passenger area is roomier than the 4-Runner and quite comfortable. Big plus is the back seat -- with one toddler and a baby on the way, we needed more room for carseats, and the Highlander is made to accommodate them. Tether system is standard, too. We also like the size of the cargo bay, even though it is a little smaller than the 4-Runner.

This thing is loaded with safety features that we can really appreciate. I always feel safe in this vehicle, and I believe my kids will be, too, even in a serious accident like my husband went through last January.

The only disappointment was that we wanted one with a charcoal interior, but we couldn't wait long enough to get one due to the insurance settlement thing. Still happy with the basic package we got, even if the interior is buff-colored and shows more dirt.
