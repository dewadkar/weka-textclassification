               I bought my 95' Avenger with only 15,000 miles on it from a 90 year old family friend.  She sure knew good cars because this Emerald Green beauty is exactly what I like in a car.  It only has the four cyl. but it is responsive and quick to react when flogged.  The handling is point and shoot spot-on, and dosen't require those tiny steering corrections to maintain center lane.  I love the comfy seats, seating position, dash design, and general driver's environment.  
   For all of those people that complain that the interior is cramped..i don't know whats up. It has the biggest sport coupe interior next to the Monte Carlo.  And has plenty of leg room for everyone.  I've had a 6'1&quot; friend in back repeatedly and he says its very comfortable.  
  I've gotten the car to 120mph before, and 0-60 will come in about 8.5 to 9.0 seconds flat-when pushed. Acceleration should be better for a car that is trying to be a sport coupe, but remember that it's the 4 cyl from the Neon.
  A wonderful car which has proved reliable as well. I would deffinately recommend it to others. I also get 25 mpg city and 35 highway. I wouldn't mind the new Status R/T Coupe but as long as I have the Avenger I'll be happy.  <br><br>
