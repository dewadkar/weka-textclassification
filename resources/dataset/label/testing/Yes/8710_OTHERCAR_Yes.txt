            I Have a 92 Honda Accord Coupe, this baby is the sweetest thing for the money talk about reliability. I have had the car since High School, and people still ask me if the car is new. I tell them its almost 8 years old. They just can't believe it. I did have an 88 Honda accord I loved that too, but I wanted new. Big mistake! but I did go back, to stay back. I will probably never sell this car. What I love about this car is my sunroof stick shift and low center of gravity for control on the road. I even find the car to be the best in snow conditions. with its front wheel drive and down shift capabilities it makes safe. I just love it<br><br>
