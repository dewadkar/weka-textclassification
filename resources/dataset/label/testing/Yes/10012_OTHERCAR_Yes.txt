            The car has been very good to me. I bought it brand new with 9 miles.  My friends liked it and were impressed that I was paying more than they thought I was for it.  I do plenty of traveling so I made sure the car was loaded.  I have done some cosmetic upgrades to it also so it looks like it is much more expensive than it is.  (Now if I can just find suitable fog lights)  The car now has over 18,000 miles and it still performs excellent.  Only problems I have had with the car is that the battery just died suddenly at 15,000 miles.  Also, the power door locks seemed to have a mind of their own when they opened and closed by themselves. Strange. The problem was remedied quickly.  The tires are pathetic.  If you take a turn a little fast they squeal and even when you take off a little fast they squeal.  I fixed that by purchasing some YOKOHAMA tires.  BIG difference! Now the car handles beautifully. The REAL problems I have had is with this new dealership that I take my Sephia to for service.  The place I bought it from in SC treated me very well though they took a little long with the service time in changing the oil, etc but other than that they were very nice and saw that my car was services properly.  HOWEVER in TX this dealership is RUDE.  I guess they think that people who buy inexpensive KIA's are not that important since they sell VW and Chevys also.  I beg to differ just to get my battery replaced the service dept gave me the third degree.  I guess they knew that I was getting ticked so they suddenly started treating me with respect but you could tell it was a front.  Only 2 guys at the place were genuine towards me.  How they can work at this place is beyond me.  I WILL be finding another KIA dealership to service my car before the next oil change.  I refuse to let those people touch my vehicle.As for the car itself it is holding up well and i would recommend a 5-speed LS to anyone who has a tight budget.  If you got extra money to spend get a CIVIC or a FOCUS.  I have heard 50/50 good and bad about KIAs. I took a chance since most of my close friends had no major complaints.  Mine has so far proved to be a good, reliable car.  Everything works excellent now and you can see the quality improvements that KIA has made. I hope they keep it up.  I just might purchase the Optima when this one gets high mileage. My KIA has been great despite a few glitches. But what do you expect from a low cost vehicle? You can't expect LEXUS quality. I hope my Sephia stays that way for quite some time.
