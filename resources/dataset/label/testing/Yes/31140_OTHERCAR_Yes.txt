            Ok so I don't own a BMW 740 IL, my dad does.  But I've driven it more than enough to know that I LOVE THIS CAR!!!  This car is just amazing.  You want luxury then this is the car to get.  I don't even know where to begin.  Performance wise this car is amazing.  With a strong engine, you'll go from 0-60 in no time.  A little step on the gas and you'll be zooming past everyone.  The engine is smooth and silent.  You feel like you're going 40 mph on the highway then when you take a look you're actually going 70.  The car handles beautifully.  Turning is smooth.  
The 740 IL is very long.  There is plenty of room in the back.  Move the passenger and driver seat back all the way, don't worry, plenty of leg room in the back.  This car is loaded with options.  The stereo offers great sound and you can get a disc changer.  Seat heaters and steering wheel heater.  Lets see, what else?  Its hard to say what this car is all about.  You have to see it for yourself.  
I have no gripes at all about this car.  If you want me to be picky then I guess the cup holders could've been a bit sturdier and bigger.  Being a fast food eater, the cups seem to be too big for the cup holder but oh well, this car rules.
If you want luxury and have loads of cash on you then go for this.  My dad has had this car for almost 2 years and nothing has gone wrong at all with the car.  Hmmm....not too sure about the price of this car although I know it's expensive.  I think it's about $60,000 fully loaded.
