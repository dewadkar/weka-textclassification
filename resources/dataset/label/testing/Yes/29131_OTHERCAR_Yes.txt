            okay this camera is great, no great doesn't even describe it
the resolution isn't the greatest but that camera still takes
beautiful pictures none the less, the zoom is about average 
it does the job and does it nicely. i go out every weekend 
and shoot pictures of parties. i take this camera with and
it takes quite a bit of punishment, but still it keeps 
shooting. with let's say a 16mb flash card you can shoot 
photo's for days. plenty of options for your flash and
also for your picture quality, you can lower your picture
quality a bit not much just a bit and shoot more photo's.
the rate of speed it has is about 2-4 seconds between photo's
depending upon the photo. i would recommend this for a few
different reasons, if you take a lot of pictures in you 
daily life then this camera is wonderful also if you
want to get past the cost of developing film. and its also
great for travel in two senses of the word. one being if you
travel and two being the pictures traveling across the net
to your friends and family. it makes photography easier,
cheaper and just plain more fun! the camera has a nice lcd
preview screen for your pictures you can also delete photo's 
on the camera if the shot didn't come out.

i am very pleased with the performance of this camera and
i am now a kodak person for life.
if i remember correctly the camera retails for 435$ 
but well worth it if you use a camera. you'll make
your money back in processing.

facts:It has megapixel picture resolution 
2X optical plus 2X digital zoom lens 
enough detail for photo-realistic 5&quot; x 7&quot; pictures  
multi-picture burst capture, time lapse, and audio recording.<br><br>
