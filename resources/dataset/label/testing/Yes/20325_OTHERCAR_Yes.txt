            We�ve had our Corolla since September of �95 and we�ve never had any real problems with it.  Maintenance has been a bit costly, but name a car that isn�t costly to maintain.

We�ve been up and down Florida from Miami to Orlando, and from Homestead to Ocala, several times in the past few years without any problems.  We currently have about 91,000 miles on the odometer and still no major work has been done.  

We would like to get a new midsize vehicle, but it�s not because we are unhappy with the Corolla, but because we are growing as a family so fast that we are outgrowing the car.  We have 3 car seats in the back now and don�t know what we�ll do if Mary has another baby.

 The Corolla has decent gas mileage, though I expected more from a car that size.  But pickup leaves much to be desired, but what do you want from a little car with a little engine.  New Corolla boasts power though!!

Overall it�s a great family car for a small family of four.  Add one more and it begins to get cramped.
