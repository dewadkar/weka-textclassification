            Drives like a large automobile Very comfortable for our family of four adults.  A little difficult for my wife, who is petite in size, to drive.Mainly she is uncomfortable with the size of the vehicle.  She loves driving it on the highway.  Cadillac comfort with the ability to carry bigger items in the rear.  The electric four wheel drive pops in and out on command very nicely. Serious music buffs probably would want to upgrade the CD player to an aftermarket model. But, for most of us listeners, the factory model is sufficient. All around a very nice and useful vehicle.
