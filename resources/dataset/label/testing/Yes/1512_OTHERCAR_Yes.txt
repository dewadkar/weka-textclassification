            In 1996 my wife needed a newer car to replace her beat up old rust bucket.  We went looking around at several dealers.  We ended up at Saturn.  I had heard many good things about this Different Kind of Car, and even more about the Different Kind of Company.  After looking at the GM Clones in the Entry Level Mid Size/ Compact (Pontiac Grand Am, Buick Skylark, Olds Achevia (at the time)) my wife was tired of looking at the same old same old, and was even more tired of the Sales People.

She suggested Looking at a Honda but the price of a Civic was simply too high for what we wanted to pay for a commuter car.  Saturn then came to mind.

The difference was amazing.  We were able to browse the lot without a bunch of hungry sharks circling around waiting for the kill, when I needed to have questions answered everybody was willing, able and friendly on top of that.

In a nutshell the reason we purchased the Saturn was because they had a good track record for quality, the price was right and the sales people really made us feel good.

After putting 30,000 miles on the car I have some praise and a few gripes.  Nothing Earth shattering in either direction. 
 First the Pros
- Fun to drive The car is tossable and handles very well
- Reliable this car has had zero problems after 30,000 miles of mostly in town use
- Two Words.  Plastic Panels.  The Doors and fenders have stayed dent and scratch free
- Resale Value. After 30,000 miles and 4 years the car is still worth $10,000
- Fuel Economy.  We get 30 MPG IN TOWN with this car.  
Now the Cons
- lack luster engine, the SOHC 1.9 may be fine mated to a manual transmission but the Automatic sucks the life and power right out of it.  It is noisy, and rough not refined.
- Cheap interior.  The Seat Fabric and Plastic used in this car are� well cheap
- Small back seat.  I know it is a small car but really the back seat is unusable for all but the smallest adult or children.

This car has been a great second car.  It works well as a daily commuter and is more fun to drive than it looks.  The biggest problems I have are the cheap materials used inside the car and the weak and unrefined engine.  The car shakes and vibrates almost violently while idling at a stop light.  The redeeming features of this car are its reliability, low cost of ownership, and the plastic panels.  This car is ding proof and able to look good even with a minimal amount of actually paint care.

Driving the car is fun, once you get it going.  The suspension is well sprung, well damped and is wonderfully advanced for a car of this class.   Saturn really did a great job setting up this car for the back roads.  The steering feel is commniciatve but slightly disconnected.  The wheel is a little thin for my taste and the steering can feel slightly over boosted.  There is the slightest hint of understeer in moderate to hard corners while in normal driving the car is quite neutral.  Trust me, you won�t win any stop light battles with the 1.9 SOHC ATX but with this car you also won�t feel the hit of rising gas prices either.

This car should be reserved for either the second car in a family or the primary car for any  single person who doesn�t need to cart more than one other adult around.  Even at $10,000 used for a 1996 SL1 it is a bargain.  The car is simply reliable,  easy to work on for the normal maintenance and the cost of ownership is remarkably low.  It isn�t very comfortable on trips of more than 1 hour in length but is great for around town.  If you have a short to mid distance commute and need reliable and inexpensive transportation this car is more than basic but not more than you need.
