            We bought a 1987 Chrysler NYer FWD to replace an ancient 1984 Dodge 600 (that had 187000 miles). We liked the 600 and were looking for a similar Chrysler product. Actually the two are siblings differing in trim, equipment and engine. We bought it in 1997 for 5800 (very high, but you have to see it).

The car is mid sized, and very luxurious. It has 70,000 miles on it. the interior is grey velour and very comfortable. The climate control A/C works very well, cooling the inside quickly. The car has all options except for a sunroof. The AM/FM cassette system is adequate. The digital instruments are informative and the Voice Alert is a nice touch (you either love it or hate it, you can mute it if you want.)There are a lot of convenience items like vanity mirrors, rear seat head rests, seat recliners, reading lamps and storage pockets. Over all, the interior is typical American Luxury, a living room on wheels, but with an informative dash and good visibility (even astern with the &quot;mail slot rear window&quot;)and driving position. It is easy to take a long trip and feel comfortable.

The body and paint have held up well, the silver paint, lustrous and shiny ( the previous owner took good care of the car). All of the power features work. Body parts and soft trim items are fairly easy to find and repairs are within reason. (we had to purchase a tail lamp lens on the internet, because of an &quot;idiot&quot; in a SUV.)

Mechanically, we have had few problems. The only repairs we have done have been a leaky oil pressure regulator($100), battery, power steering pump($200), and exhaust system. There have been a few other minor repairs (what do you expect from a 13 year old car?) that have been very inexpensive. Our previous Dodge 600, a mechanical relative, was very reliable giving us 178,000 miles of trouble free motoring (it even had the original transmission--the only major repair we had was a timing belt at 100,000. So far this car is meeting that criteria.

 The 2.5 litre FI engine is fairly smooth and provides sufficient power for passing and merging. The softly sprung chassis yields safe and predictable handling and a pillow soft ride. This is boulevard cruiser, not a road racer. Gas mileage is very good, better than other luxury cars. Its medium size means that you wont have trouble parking it, has room for four with comfort and a useful shaped deep trunk. 

The only down part is that the electronic A/C switch had to be replaced and the silver vinyl &quot;landau&quot; top is very fragile. (I have seen others with this roof badly deteriorated.)

This is an excellent car if you are looking for a car that doesn't cost much and want a lot of features. In this day and age, it has a traditional, classic look in contrast to the blobs and potatoes people drive today. 

You can still find them in used car lots with low mileage and in great shape. They were popular with mature drivers who rarely flog their cars. My suggestions if you select one, is to get a COMPLETE mechanical check before you buy and change the oil often (1500-2000 miles). Based on our previous experiences with the &quot;E&quot; family of Chryslers, you get a really reliable car, provided you find a good one.<br><br>
