             Hi my name is Michelle , I am a 22 female from N.C. i have owned Saab's for the last past 3 years . In the last three years i have owned two Saab's . <br> The First Saab i had bought was a 85 Saab 900 turbo i bought it used. I at first had bought the car because of the safety factors  . Everything worked and i had nothing fixed on it until i felt that my transmission was going a year latter. I had then found out for a automatic transmission for that car was way out of my league . <br><br> I then decided to give Saab's another chance but this time i bought a 92 Saab used but a stick shift , The car is great, again i have had no problems with anything major and no oil leaks which Saab's are known for. <br><br><br> I definitely recommend this vehicle . First the vehicle is both great for safety aspects but also the roominess this vehicle does have . I would recommend this car for people who have family's of 4 or less no more then 4 or 5 people can fit in the car at one time  . <br><br> There are some things that u may want to consider before buying a Saab . First, the cost is very expensive for a used Saab i bought it for  8,000 dollars and it had 120,000 thousand miles on it . Second is the price of parts when need to get fixed are expensive and are hard to find some parts . <br><br> In all though i do recommend this car to one who has the money and loves a great car which is not only great to drive but last at least 150,000 miles . <br><br> My Saab has already 140,000 miles on it and is doing great no problems what so ever . I have owned this car for a year  <br><br><br>
