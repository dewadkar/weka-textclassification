            I have owned my 2000 Golf GLS 4-Dr for 4 mos. I have the automatic, I LOVE this car! It has great styling (even though the platform is 25 years old)and the engine, brakes, suspension, and quality reek of a much more 
expensive car. (A friend of mine has the Mercedes 300 and I like my car better) I have only had 1 trip back to the dealer, and the service was great, and a free loaner! It turned out to be a loose connector, my auto
transmission would not go into 4th gear. I have been averaging 28 mpg, and I get many compliments on the car. I love the silver paint and the fit and 
finish of the interior and exterior. It is really a quality car! 

My complaints would be 1) Back seat a bit tight. 2) Black seat cloth picks up lint. 3)Engine rpm at bit high at 60 mph, (3200). 4)Heat a/c controls are hard to see. 

Otherwise, it is a blast, and easy to operate, own, park, travel in, carry things in, you name it!  It has a comfortable ride with a touch of sport feel and handling, I absolutely made a good choice, I drove the Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, and the Hyundai Sonata, even a Beetle! The Golf won hands down!<br><br>
