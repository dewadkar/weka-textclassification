            I bought the Nissan Quest 1997 XE van brand new. I believe in taking care of the cars I own. Oil changes every 3,000 miles. Had a Nissan Sentra that went 230,000 miles, before I gave it (still running great) to the Salvation Army. I bought the Quest thinking I could get similiar reliability. So far it has been reliable (50,0000 trouble-free miles), but I sure do miss the space and ergonomics of the Dodge Caravan.

I rented a Caravan in Florida while on vacation, and really liked the space and ergonomics. It is sad they have such terrible reliability reputations. BUT if I had it to do all over again I would probably buy a Caravan and then sell it just before the warranty ran out.

The Nissan is a really smooth driving van... mostly I think because it is the size of a medium car. I have grown concerned over what would happen in an accident. I just don't think the Quest has enough metal between my family and the road.

The V6 engine is the same as in the Maxima. The engine and transmission have a proven reliablity record....Consumer reports has shown Quest owners report far fewer enigne/transmission problems than the Caravan. Both the engine and the transmission have so far been silky smooth. The engine provides good power, but hills often require pushing the overdrive "OFF" button to give a boost...

The seats are nicely configured. You can slide the rear seat (3 seat) up to the second seat to free up "trunk" room. No lifting required, unless you want to remove the second seat, so you can slide the third seat up to the front seats.

The body hardware (belts, knobs, handles) are very cheap and I have had them break off in my hand.

The radio is a pain to operate. The controls are poorly laid out.

I hate the vent controls. They are also poorly designed. And the fans sometimes whine....

My biggest beef is that the driver is cramped. I am 5 feet 11 inches tall and have just barely enough room. Long trips are a pain. If only there was another inch or two room between me and the steering wheel.

I do like the firmness of the seats. I have a bad back, and the Quest seats were the only ones that supported my lower back to the degree I needed. 

The carpet is very thin and cheap.

The air conditioning was good.

I go back and forth. According to Consumer Reports, you have a 33% chance of having an engine/transmission problem with the Dodge Caravan... on the other hand, you can have a very reliable Nissan Quest (non-1996 year), BUT it is small and maybe not as crash safe as the Caravan...
