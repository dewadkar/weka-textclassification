            I was driving an Explorer Sport the night of December 3rd, 1999.  Well we were coming home from dinner and 3 deer ran out on to the roadway from the field on the drivers side of the vehicle.  

I tried to stop but could not do it in time and I struck a small doe.  The damage to the explorer was not bad because of the height of the vehicle.  I hit the deer with the drivers front corner of the SUV and it bounced off and then hit the drvs side quater panel and the door.  If we would have been in a car the deer would have been flipped up onto the hood and possably into the windshield.

A SUV is a safer vehicle to drive then the normal car.  Although deer are unpredictable and can come out of anywhere at any time.  Be safe and add the deer whistle to your car or truck.<br><br>
