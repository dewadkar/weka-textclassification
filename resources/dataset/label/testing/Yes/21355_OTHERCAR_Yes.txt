            I bought a 1999 Camry LE because it is one of the few offered with a 5-spd manual transmission AND a six cylinder engine.  I love the power and speed it has for a car that kinda looks like a family car.  I can hang with a Pontiac Grand Prix, and beat up on the smaller Grand Am.  Yet I have four doors if I want to go out on the town and take another couple...

This vehicle is perfect for anyone like me who wanted a sports car, but had to be more practical.  While it was relatively expensive compared to many smaller cars, I have the V-6 and a sunroof, CD &amp; cassete player and power drivers seat at a pre-tax price of $21,357.  I know I won't be pulling my hair out driving it since I can drive it like a sports car (although it is tough on the tires) but when the kids (or neighbors) come along they actually fit!

If you just graduated from college and can afford this car, it is a much better choice than a two seater or two door.  It handles good in the snow and rain, and all around I love it.  The only down side is that statistics show that in a few years, it will be stolen quite often... but hey, can't live in fear of that.

Only problem so far is the emergency brake light comes on sometimes when the brake isn't actually on...<br><br>
