              This is a GREAT camera.  I thought it was ugly at first, but once I started taking pictures with it I fell in love with it. I use this camera almost everyday taking passport photos, and here is what I think about the camera. 

Pros:

  It gives out less red eye to its subjects than it's older brother, the coolpix 950 (which is why I use it for the portraits).
  It is inexpensive, but offers the same photo quality as the coolpix 950.
  It prints 8x10's that look VERY close to regular 35mm enlargements.
  4x6 prints look BETTER than normal 35mm prints (in my opinion)
  Small, lightweight, durable
  Apeture priority: Enables you to manually set the field of depth
  Shutter priority: Enables you to manually set the speed
  ISO 80, 160, and 320 equiv.
  
Cons:

   There is a medium to long wait in between shots (fine resolution setting, high compression).  
   You can only fit 1 ultra high quality TIFF photo on the memory card
   The compact flash door is located on the bottom, so I have to take the camera off of the tripod to get the compact flash card out! very annoying!
   It has 2x zoom, vs the 3x zoom of the coolpix 950.
   It is not the coolest looking camera (but has its own kind of luster)
   
Overall:

  Would I buy it? If I was on a budget and I got a deal on it, then yes.  The photos are the highest quality you will find in a 2 megapixel camera. If you need, above all, high quality images, but are on a budget, then this is your camera. The coolpix 990 is so much more tempting, if you can afford the $400 more. <br><br>
