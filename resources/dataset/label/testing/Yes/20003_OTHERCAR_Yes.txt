            I have driven Lexus ES 300 so many times. This car is a very good car available with lots of luxury at a very resonable price. You can enjoy the luxury of Lexus at low cost. If we don't consider the luxury, Toyota Camry is almost the same car as Lexus EX 300. This year I had two options available with me; Lexus ES 300 and Toyota Camry. I bought Lexus ES 300. I really enjoy my car. But I would like to make a comparision between Lexus ES 300 and Toyota Camry. The model is almost the same. Ride of both the cars are equally smooth and noise free. But Toyota Camry has more interior and trunk space. Camry is available in single tone as well as two tone colors. Camry with two tone colors is exectly similar to Lexus ES 300. If a buyer is not concerned about the brand name and luxury, I would suggest to buy Toyota Camry XLE V6 with Leather interior. It will almost nearer to Lexus ES 300 model and save atleast $6000. But if the buyer is looking for luxury at a low price, according to my opinion Lexus ES 300 is the best car to buy.<br><br>
