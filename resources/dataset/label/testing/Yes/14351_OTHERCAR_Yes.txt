  I just recently bought the new 2000 Altima and I love it more than any other car I have ever had. I am paying just under 400 dollars a month for 36 months to buy the Altima with all leather seats, sun roof, 4x anti lock brakes, all power windows, power seats, tape/cd/radio, wood paneling, and chrome wheels. I love my new car more than life itself.
  The cars four cylinder engine can get your car moving form 0-60 miles per hour in about 9.6 seconds. The Altima is a four door beast with a trunk that can fit about 5 people(or about 7+ golf bags). The Altima also has a oversized opening to the trunk so you can fit large objects into it. If you are taking one of those trips to Home Depot to pick up long 2x4's the back seat folds down and the trunk opens up to the back seat.
  The automatic transmission is extremely smooth and responsive yet you can feel the car shift and you always have an idea for what gear your in. An extra plus is the keyless entry(if you have never had this, it's great). The key opens up the driver door, all doors, the trunk, and a theft deterrent system that also locks the doors. Last but not least there are several compartements to put your random stuff, a special place designed for glasses, and a programmable garage door opener built in. By this car and I guarantee you will love it.

P.S. If you live in the Connecticut area go to Wagner Nissan and ask for Russ.........he is the best!.
