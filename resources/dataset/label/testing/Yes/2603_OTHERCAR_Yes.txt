            OK - So I had a used 1994 SAAB 900 SE,v6,4 door. I was in a pretty bad accident where someone had hit me from behind on the highway damaging the whole back end and the engine in the front. While my car was in the shop and I decided to look around for another vehicle knowing that the SAAB would never drive the same. I decided to get a Maxima SE. Why you might ask, let me tell you.

First of all I wanted something that was somewhat comparable to the 900 but didn't want to buy another used car. I did some research through consumer magazines and asked around about the Maxima.  The thing that sold me first of all was it's great reputation for speed, handling, engine and overall resale value. The Maxima has a 190 horsepower engine that really moves ( unless your looking at the new 2000 + with 220 horsepower, even faster ). I got the standard 5 speed stick shift . The base Maxima alone handles pretty well but the SE is even better. The SE also looks better on the outside in my opinion. The whiteface gauges look cool too. I got the security and convenience package with the sunroof, power everything and other gadgets. I had leather installed separately because I didn't need all the gadgets that the Nissan leather package offered. It has everything I want without all the extras I don't  want that came with the SAAB. So the brake lights look strange but that's ok because the rest of the car looks pretty snazzy. The seats are a bit uncomfortable I'll admit ( especially compared to the anti whiplash high sculpted seats in my SAAB - which obviously came in handy for me ). 

Overall I have been happy with my decision to  lease the Maxima. I know that if I decide to finance the car at the end of the lease then sell it I will get a good price for it because of it's past rep. But I think I'll hold onto it when the lease is up. I suggest you look into buying or leasing one.  <br><br>
