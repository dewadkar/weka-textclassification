                  I've owned my Jeep Cherokee SE since I bought it new in 1996. Now I am looking into buying another for my wife. I have found this vehicle to be very reliable; only one trip to the dealer for a minor computer glitch,(since 1996!).
      The engine has plenty of power and the four wheel drive system couldn't be any simpler; shift into four high at speeds up to 55 mph.
We live on a very steep hill in New England and have never had a problem in the snow...I actually go looking for tough hills in the snow just to see what it can do! I Have yet to get stuck.
      The gas mileage is not the greatest. I average about 17 mpg...not bad, but it would be nice to get a bit more.
      As far as leg room is concerned, the front is good, but the rear seats can get a little cramped if the front passenger and/or driver needs to slide the seats all the way back.
      There is a fair amount of cargo space in the rear, although we use a roof cargo carrier on road trips. Also the spare tire is stored in the rear cargo area, taking up some space, but making it very convenient if it is needed.
      In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Jeep Cherokee, although my next one will probably be the Sport model(power options,etc.)It costs a bit more, but probably worth it!<br><br>
