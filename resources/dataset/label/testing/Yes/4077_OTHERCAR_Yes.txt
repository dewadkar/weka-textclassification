            With the birth of our third child we needed a bigger vehicle (we had a 1996 Ford Taurus before)but I was not looking forward to driving a minivan. I have heard bad things about the way they drive but thankfully this one feels almost like driving a car! Which is nice since we live in a valley and have to drive up many curvy roads.
It handles very nicely on the curves.

Our van also has the automatic sliding door which comes in handy when you have a two year old in one hand and a baby in the other. We have had some problems with it however. Occasionally the door will open back up on it's own. We took it in to the dealer and they said there was nothing wrong with it and that it just needed to be cleaned. So now when we notice the door opening back up we wipe off the sensors and it seems to work alright after that for a while. We live on a gravel road so maybe that is part of the problem.

As far as gas mileage we were not expecting it to be very economical but so far we get about18-20 in town  and up to 30 on the highway which I think is pretty good for a van.

Not only has this van come in handy for transporting the kids it is also great for hauling around other things. (Since my husband doesn't have a truck he uses my van like one and I haven't heard any complaints from him yet.) We even used it to haul the new carpet for our basement.
The back seats fold up with just a tug on a little loop. It is a little harder too put them back down but over all it is fairly easy. It would be nicer if they folded under into the floor.

Over all the Chevy Venture has been a pleasure to drive. And I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a van but doesn't want to feel like they are driving one.
