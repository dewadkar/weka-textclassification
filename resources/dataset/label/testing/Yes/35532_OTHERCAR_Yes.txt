            I've always be pleased with the Kodak line of digital cameras as you can really tell that Kodak has given some serious though to just how many bells an whistles a real person needs.

The new series of camera from kodak continue this trend.  The DX3900 is very simple to use even without the manual.  

The camera has a 3.1 MP chip, 2x optical, 3x digital zoom.  Unlike some of the other models in this line the 3900 does not have any internal storage, it has to use a compact flash card.  Also is doesn't have a movie mode, though from what I've experienced on other cameras you aren't losing much by not having this feature.

There is a limited ability to adjust ISO and exposure compensation but given the intent of the camera its not surprising it isn't feature loaded.

The images are very good overall, a little dark indoors with the flash but outside in the sun they look great.  Blue skies especially come through nicely.

The menu system is very easy to navigate and pretty intuitive.  The menus change depending on the mode the camera is easy so sometimes you might get confused as to why you can't find a particular option.

The only "problem" I've had is that the autofocus is sometimes a little to slow to respond sometimes resulting in a blurry picture when you might be trying to snap a quick shot.

Given the choice between the DX3900 and something like the Olympus 3000 or Nikon CoolPix 990 I'd pick the kodak and not just for price reasons.  It is because I know everyone in our house can use the Kodak just by picking it up and pushing the button.  We have a Coolpix at work and its a hassle to use for just basic shots.

The optional docking station is not really necessary, unless you want the option for using rechargable batteries (which seem rather expensive I must say).  It is convenient but I'd rather use a compact flash reader.

Incidentally the firmware on the camera is upgradeable so check for updates at the kodak website.

The software that comes with the camera is pretty rudimentary but offers easy to use basic tweaking/editing options.
