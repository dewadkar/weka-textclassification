            I bought this vehicle because it was a good price and had all the features I needed. I bought it is 1998 and have yet to have any trouble with it at all. It is roomy enough for the kids but still small enough so that I don't feel like I am driving a boat. It has an excellent stereo and air conditioning, adjustable seats and it handles great. Three carseats fit in the back with a roomy trunk for strollers. Handles great in the snow with it's Extended Traction System. 
My Grand Am goes everywhere I want it to go and hasnt complained once!<br><br>
