            We purchased our Chevy Cavalier after our previous automobile quit, on the first day of class. I shopped around many dealers the following two weeks, and finally our Chevy dealer recommended the Cavalier. It was not as sporty as some of the other automobiles I had driven, but let me tell you...it was the best choice I ever made. We initially loved the purchase price and the fact that a national lender would accept us. Two days later, we took our new prize on a test drive, 320 miles up to the mountains. She drove like a dream and got excellent gas mileage! 

We selected a four door model, which our teenager loved. The back seat has more leg room than I have ever seen in a mid-sized car! I chose to sleep on the return trip, and actually slept comfortably most of the way. The back seat is much more comfortable than many automobiles. 

The gas mileage is great! We average 35-40 miles per gallon on the highway, with virtually no ongoing maintenance...other than oil changes, etc. Today, we replaced the brake shoes and spent a mere $19.00 for the set! It was wonderful! The Cavalier has excellent &quot;pick-up&quot; from stops and in passing gear! You feel like you are in a Indy Sports Car!

Our payments are low, which is a major factor since we also just purchased a new home. It has a sleek style, looking sharp running down the road! I highly recommend this car to anyone who travels often, is on the basic American budget, or who has a student needing a dependable car!!! We have never been happier with an automobile, and are planning to trade it in on a newer model next year!!

Searching for a new car?  Chose a Chevy Cavalier!!
