            I received this camera as a gift.  I had been wanting a digital camera for some time but I could not find my way through the maze of pixels and options.  I have talked to friends, searched on ZDnet and other helpful websites.  The decision-making was the hardest part.  The surprise gift made the choice a lot easier.  After using this camera at a wedding I feel comfortable recommending it as a great place to start.
	I love gadgets and love researching them as many of my gender does.  There are so many cameras in this new market I found it hard to start looking.  How many pixels do you need is the first question to answer.  2.2 do a mighty fine job as it turns out.  This camera has options for full and half resolution.  Within these 2 levels there are an additional 3 levels of resolution.  In my first few minutes with the camera I could see the difference on the LCD screen.  With an 8MB Smartmedia card to start with, I chose the middle of the road, on both levels, to start.  It has a great balance of clarity and storage.  Once the wedding began I used the higher resolution settings and the pictures came out awesome.  Of course the batteries had already been changed once.
	Having battery options is another very nice feature of this camera.  Since it flies through the juice, being able to use disposable or rechargeable batteries is a great option.  I have a rechargeable battery kit now and will try to use this as the greenest solution whenever possible.
	To be honest, I don�t like to read really long reviews on Epinions so - I will summarize below.
	
	The features of this camera I think are great are this;
1.	Smartmedia card storage � It is easy to use and small.
2.	USB cable interface � I know USB 2 is faster but this was still pretty fast for what I need.
3.	Uses regular AA batteries in either the alkaline or rechargeable format.  You can always find AA batteries in a pinch.  Try finding a photo specialized battery when you need one!
4.	LCD screen- you can review your pictures right away.
5.	Perfect resolution (2.2 mega pixel) options for a weekend/vacation photographer. My kids look great in the pictures!
6.	You can watch the pictures on the TV with the other cables included.  Pretty neat I thought.
7.	Power cord available to charge batteries in the camera.
8.	Easy to download pictures to the photo album software.
9.	Compact size.


Things I thought could be better;
1.	Battery consumption seems ferocious.  I barely made it through a single 8MB card before I ran out.
2.	The LCD viewfinder is worthless for taking pictures at night.  It works fine for viewing pictures anytime.
3.	The pixel/resolution icons didn�t� make sense at first.  This from someone who does not like to use the instructions unless under duress.  Once I figured it out it makes a lot more sense.
4.	It is hard to see through the standard viewer if you have a moderate sized nose.  This aspect is inevitable when you go with a compact size.  I can overlook it.
5.	The software included could be a bit easier to use.  I can�t imagine my techno-phobic mother trying to figure out how to use the computer connection and software for this.
6.	You have to get used to the delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken.  I got quite a few shots of the scene I moved my hands to not the scene I intended. Once you get the delay figured out it is really no big deal.
7.	There is no sound or movie option.  There is a multi shot feature that makes a quasi movie.  

Overall this is a winner of a package for my first camera.  I am sure I will want more in the future.  By then I think I will be better able to afford all those cool features.  For a simple high quality camera I like this one.
