            I am the youngest of 4 children and I grew up in a &quot;mini-van&quot; family.  I always said that I would never buy a mini-van...well times have changed.  My wife and I had our first child and we realized that our SUV was no longer practical.  We had heard many good things about the Olds Silhouette so we decided to test drive one.  From the time we got in the car we were in love.  We left the lot that day in our new family vehicle.

The Olds Silhouette is very spacious.  There is seating for 7 people in our particular van.  I might add that these 7 can fit comfortably.  Another option that we really love and find extremely helpful is the automatic sliding back door.  This allows to open the door with our keyless entry system before getting to the car.  When you are carrying around a 9 lb. baby it is nice not having to worry about opening a car door.  I believe that the Silhouette has several good, yet practical, options.  Some of those include rear heating which allows passengers in the rear to control their own temperature.  Other options are the self-leveling, driver and passenger air-bags, an air pump located in the back of the car, the overhead console, and the great gas mileage.  The only item I would like to see improved is the padding in the seat.  I feel their could be more there for the driver and passengers.

Driving this vehicle is quite enjoyable.  The car is very powerful, yet is smooth to ride in.  All of the controls that the driver needs to get to are easily accessible, taking away some of the dangers of driving.  

I feel that this vehicle is not only a family vehicle but one that anyone in need of space could benefit from.  If you have kids, pets, or a business that works from your car the Olds Silhouette is the one for you.  If you are thinking about buying any type of vehicle, give this one a chance and I can guarantee you will enjoy the ride.<br><br>
