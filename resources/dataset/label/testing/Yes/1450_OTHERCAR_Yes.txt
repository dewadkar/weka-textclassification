            The Yashica's KC 600 digital camera is the best choice for any first digital camera purchase.  It is small, light weight, comfortable to carry, and is simple to use.  This camera resembles point-and-shoot cameras because it includes a manual viewfinder for you look through while taking pictures.  This is an extremely nice feature if you are one that likes to conserve battery life on the four AA batteries that the camera requires.  And believe me, you want to conserve energy because the batteries go quick on this contraption.  

<b>Description</b>

The camera has a fixed-focus 6.5mm lens and a 1.8-inch LCD screen for shooting and viewing photos. Features include a  self-timer, built-in flash with red-eye reduction, electronic exposure indicator (a sound tells you when you snapped a photo), and the ability to toggle through each picture and erase what you do not want.  It also is shipped standard with a 2MB flash card device that can hold 12 fine resolution photos, 37 standard photos at 640 by 480 resolution, or up to 80 photos at lower resolution.  It also has a 1.8 inch LCD for quick review of your pictures, a video cable for viewing photos on a TV set, as well as a PC Card adapter for notebook PCs. 

<b>Use</b>

One feature that I immensely enjoy is the simplicity of the camera�s controls and their operation.  There are three buttons and one dial on the entire camera.  One button is dedicated for snapping the picture, and the other two buttons are used for picture navigation only.  The dial is utilized for setting your options camera.  That�s it.  Every button has one use, and only one use.  So simple and so easy. 

<b>Picture Quality</b>

For a simple tool, the picture quality is excellent.  Shadows are at a minimum and it definitely eliminates red-eye.  It has a maximum resolution of 1.2 megapixels (fine resolution). Of course, you will want to stick with the fine resolution top get the best possible photos.

<b>Software</b>

The software for the program is also simple and easy.  You will not have to set any TWAIN 32 drivers to make it work either.  Upon loading, the software program gives you a cute menu screen that gives you the ability to �GET PHOTOS FROM YASHICA CAMERA.�  Once you click on it, the software lets you view your photos and download them from your camera via a serial cable.

The software lets you reduce red-eye, rotate and crop pictures, and has the ability to make greeting cards and fancy e-mails.  It is a simple program with few options that I would classify more so as a functional means to get your photos on your computer rather than a great graphics/picture program.  That is why I use Photoshop 5.0 still to edit my pictures.  I recommend you do the same.
    
<b>Cost</b>

Cheap.  I got this item in an auction for $200 1.5 years ago.  I gander that you can get it cheaper than that today..

I recommend this camera for beginners and generic family use.  Especially if you are just using it to put photos on the web.  This camera is not for people with publications and/or a need for high resolution graphics.
