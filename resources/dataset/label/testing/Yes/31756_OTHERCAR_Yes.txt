            I must agree with some that the BMW is pricier than other cars that offer more in the way of luxuries. However one has to remember that the 3 series is at the bottom of a high class of cars, a class in which you pay for the name BMW, the reliability its reputation has proved and the peace of mind knowing that virtually nothing will go wrong with this car, and if it does, BMW is VERY good about customer service. Several dealers in the Southern California area offer complimentary flat-bed pick-up for servicing as well as a nice loaner.

Just to answer to some of the criticism, the base model may not be a dream car, but at 26K, what did you expect? I think 32K is an EXTREMELY reasonable price to pay for a 4-door, automatic, CD, leather interior, moonroof-equipped car, especially a BMW. The stereo system is exceptional, and controls on the steering wheel for cruise control AND the stereo/CD make driving safe and convenient. The windows and sunroof can be opened even while the driver is 60 feet away just using the remote key. If one window is left open after everyone has exited the car, the driver doesn't have to get back in, start the ignition and close the window - it can be done from outside also using the key. The key also has a microchip so it absolutely can not be hot-wired or stolen without the key. A thief would have to tow it away. The car has other options that can be personalized to several drivers such as temperature, seat and mirror positions, automatic door-locks after a certain speed has been reached, automatic headlights, etc. The car recognizes the driver by which key is being used, and all this can be customized for free. The car is pre-wired for CD-changer, car phone connection through the speakers. (Does the Lexus GS have these options? I'm afraid not.) Starting from the new model 99s, the back seat is much roomier than previous models. Going from an SUV to a beemer, I don't feel any sacrifice in space either in the cabin or in the trunk. True the car only has 170hp, but it drives better the new Jag. The size is perfect so it's almost likes a sports car while giving you the ride of the luxury car.

Now I also have some gripes that someone would only notice after driving the car for several months. Others might not find these as important, and they would definitely not keep me from recommending the car or even buying it all over again, but BMW should hear about these and I have contacted them. The vanity mirrors don't have lights which is a little inconvenient because then one has to turn on the cabin lights. The cabin lights illuminate the entire car and there is now way to control what portion of the car is lit, so back seat readers will be a little upset. Also, lighting the car makes it difficult to drive at night. The car did not come with carpets to protect the carpet on the base of the car. BMW also programmed the car so only the $700 BMW CD-changer is compatible. There is no way to control which speakers music plays from (this might bother some of us who want the music to play for the kids while we're on the phone in the front).

Overall, the car handles beautifully and I am extremely happy with it. I have not had a single problem in the year I've owned it, and BMW truly treats you like family. The car comes with three years free servicing and free nationwide emergency roadside assistance, and they get there quicker than AAA. Their customer service is EXCEPTIONAL, and I recommend this car to anyone who believes in safety, dependability, and luxury at a reasonable price.
