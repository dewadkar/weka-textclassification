            I purchased my 2000 Ford Taurus SE Wagon in January of 2001. A left over model with all the options and the little Vulcan engine. 

I pride myself in knowing alot about cars and I see some other opinions here I don't agree with so I will comment on these also. For example why would you listen to anyone that starts off by saying "I've never liked Fords". How can anyone with that attitude provide an unbiased opinion.

The 12 valve engine vs 24 valve engine. Everyone wants to have the 24 valve engine because it produces 200hp. I also has produced the most problems, and has the most recalls. The little Vulcan with its modest 155hp is by far the best engine for a number of reasons. It is the most reliable, and it can also be boosted to higher performance with little effort. For example.. for you hobby types... did you know you can buy a super charger from Ford for the Vulcan engine? Yup.. look under the Ford Probe with the same engine. 

However, if you simply want to get a few more pony's out of your Vulcan you can simply drill a few 1" holes in the bottom of your air box, swap your OEM filter for a K&N air filter, and then swap out your OEM spark plugs for Bosch Platinum +4's. You'll feel the difference right away and you'll beat every Dodge Intrepid (or Taurus 24 valve) you come across. 

When your muffler falls off a few years later you can ask your friendly muffler shop to stick on the duals from an SHO with a size adaptor on the main pipe.. and there's yet another jump in hp. It's all that easy. 

By the way I also get 32 mpg (Imperial gallon) overall along with good performance.

Yes... Ford needs to smarten up on some issues. The rear wiper is one. It's too small and at an odd angle to allow the rear window to open as it does. Also the rear washer squirts out above the wiper rendering it almost usless. BUT.. if you charge the wiper to a larger one, that doesn't hit the rear latch handle, and add a small hose to the blade attached to the washer with a screw in nipple you solve both problems. 

The Taurus is an average car.. but it came in high on the NHTSA and the IIHS crash tests. It is also the number three car for not rolling over easily. It's a very safe car and a very comfortable and reliable car. It is recommended by the Consumer Reports where many others are not.

Mine came with the rear facing third row seats, rear cover and the Mach stereo package. The stereo is one of the best I've ever had. The vehicle is also capable of carrying 1100 pounds. Not many can match that.

I now have over 70,000 kms on this vehicle and I haven't had one single thing go wrong with it. The worst thing I can say about it is that I'm not impressed with the tires, but I have now replaced them so we'll see. 

I think my Taurus is one of the best cars I've ever owned and I've had many.
