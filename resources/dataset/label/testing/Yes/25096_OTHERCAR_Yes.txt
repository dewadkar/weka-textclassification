            I bought my Trail Blazer new in March of 2002.  Overall, I like the vehicle...it is comfortable to ride in/drive and has room to carry most of what I want to haul.  I get good gas mileage with mine--between 19 and 21 mpg all the time (even got 22+ on a long trip)--and LOVE the way it looks!  I have the forest green color--very rich looking!  I'm not a car buff and don't know a lot of the jargon so this will just be an explanation of what I've had happen since I bought my Trail Blazer.  It's still under warranty with only 16,000 miles on it (August, 2003).

I have several complaints with the vehicle.  The 1st one is that the back seats (I have the 5 passenger model) don't lay flat when I lay them down.  It doesn't make sense to me at all!  If I want to haul something long, I have to make sure that it isn't so tall that it will rub against the ceiling when it is pushed in all the way. I couldn't take  several pieces of furniture to my daughter because of this problem.  Also had to be careful hauling 12" x 12" concrete patio blocks--had to put enough blankets down to make a flat surface so they wouldn't crack on the way home from the lumber yard. 

Another complaint I have is that the doors on my vehicle have locked all by themselves when we've just gotten out.  Once, I was at the post office and came out to find I was locked out (I'd left the keys in the ignition--we live in a very small town).  All of the doors were locked (I had to call home to get someone to bring the other set of keys so I could drive home.)  Another time my husband got out and, again, left the keys in the ignition and he was locked out.  Only this time, just the driver's door locked and he was able to climb in from the passenger side.  NOT A GOOD THING!!!  The vehicle can be running or turned off--doesn't seem to matter.  Now I have a "break away" keychain and the door fob is on a part that I can detach and take with me.  Took the car to the dealer but they could find no problem.

A third problem (and a real BIGGEE!!!!)--the 4-wheel drive wouldn't engage.  In fact, there were no lights indicating there was even this option available when this happened.  I don't know how long the car had been this way as it wasn't my practice to check to see if the yellow light above 2WD was lit when I started the car---I DO IT EVERY TIME NOW!!!!  I was driving on some unfamiliar roads and attempted to turn around in a small driveway.  It had rained recently and I didn't see the water/mud just beyond the edge of the road.  I sunk in and, when I tried to activate the 4-wheel drive option, got nothing.  Ended up walking over a mile in the rain with my grandson to find help.  I was not happy!  The main reason I got an SUV instead of another van was to have the 4-wheel drive capability.  I took the car into the dealer and was told they had to pull all the fuses and reset the computer. They also told me they found a "bulletin" concerning this problem. 

Another few minor items:  After owning the car for about a month, I found a small ball bearing and 2 small rubber "bumpers" on the floor behind the driver's seat.  When I took the car in for the 1st oil change, I also asked them to put these parts back where they belonged. When I picked the car up I was told that they didn't put the parts in because they didn't know where they were supposed to go.  ????????????????????????

Another thing I find annoying is that the rear seat belts LOCK in place when they are fastened and the only way to get them to unlock is to allow some of the belt to go back into the holder.  But, if you do allow more of the belt to go back into the holder, you can't get it to come out again unless you allow ALL of the seat belt to go back into the holder!!!  I have my grandson's car seat behind the passenger seat.  Anyone who has used a child's car seat knows that to get it truly tight you must actually climb into the car seat and push down with all your might to tighten up the seat belt as tightly as possible.  Then you must install the metal "clip" that keeps the seat belt from moving on its own.  It is not an easy job, to say the least.  If I need to remove the car seat for some reason, it is IMPOSSIBLE to keep the metal clip on the seat belt so all I'd have to do is fasten the belt when I put the car seat back in the car because the seat belts in the Trail Blazer LOCK in the position in which they are used. When I disconnect the seat belt, to take out the car seat, it automatically starts going back inside the holder but won't come out again to the place it was before.  This means that I must allow ALL OF THE SEAT BELT to go back into the holder before I can pull it out again.  I must remove the metal clip and start from the beginning.  (I have solved the problem by pinning  the seat belt together at the ceiling--where it comes through the guide--with 2 large safety pins.  Now the seat belt can't go back in the holder at all and I can leave the metal clip on it and just reconnect the belt when I put the car seat back in.)
