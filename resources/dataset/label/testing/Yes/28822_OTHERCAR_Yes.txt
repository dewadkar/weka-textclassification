            We bought our Kodak Digital camera just about 5 months ago right before a trip to the Grand Canyon.  It was great fun to use at the Grand Canyon but I noticed a couple of problems right away.

The first problem was where the back screen is located. It is in a strange place and your nose gets pushed up against it making a smudge.The next problem was batteries. It eats batteries. You are forced to buy a battery recharger or you will end up owning Duracell. But we love being able to look at our photos and discarding the ones that didn't work out immediately. 

Now I ended up buying a second Card I found that Wal-Mart had the best prices at the time. Shop around because this is a big difference in prices on the cards.

The worse thing is downloading to my computer. I don't know which is to blame here the camera or my computer.  Now it may be the software program. But it takes forever to download the photos from the camera to the computer.

Now I realize that I have written a bunch of complaints about the camera. But I do enjoy it.  It is lightweight. You can discard the photos immediately and we have fun with it. One of my favorite pictures is of my new nephew in a swing. I took the photo as he was swinging. It is a great starter digital. I would recommend it for someone just starting out.  <br><br>
