            This is the best vehicle that I have ever owned.  It has the perfect combination of durability, value and good looks.  I bought my Honda Accord in 1992 and have since put over 130,000 miles on it.  This amount of miles is a stretch for any car regardless of price, but my Accord has made it through with VERY minimal maintenace and repair needed.  So far my biggest repair has been a new muffler and set of tires.  This car defines the words durable and reliable.  

Driving the car is fantastic.  It is low to the ground and extremely fast making for exciting driving anywhere.  I got mine with every available option and they are worth every penny.  The automatic moon roof is especially nice in the summer months.

I have even taken this car off road on a 2 track sandy road and it handled great.  My only complaint is that it does not do so well in the snow.  

Overall I would reccomend getting a used Accord over a new one.  The new ones are very expensive and the used cars will last almost as long for a much lower price.   <br><br>
