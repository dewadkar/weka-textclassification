            I bought my Chevrolet Silverado 1500 back in 1991. It was a very reasonable price for the quality of the truck.  It was built to last.  It had 2 miles on it when I bought it. Currently, 9 years later, it has 78,500 miles on it.  It hasn't been driven to often.  I have not had any major repairs done on it.  just the usual oil changes every 3,000 miles, brakes replaced twice, transmission fluid changes every 25,000 miles, regular tune-ups, and new tires.  It has been washed every week, and waxed every other week.  It is a very clean vehicle.  
It is a regular cab truck with two wheel drive. I lived in the city and didn't really need something to drive in dirt. It has a 4.3 Liter, V-6 engine in it. It has a little bit of power to it. Typical V-6.  There has been no mechanical problems with it so far. It has been a very reliable truck, in all kinds of weather.  It rides very comfortable for a truck. It has had good gas mileage since day 1.  It still gets about 19 MPG in the city and 24MPG on the highway. That is really good. It came from the factory pretty much how I wanted it.  The only add ons I put on it was a cd player, and a camper-shell.  Other than that it is original. 
I really like Chevrolet pickup trucks, not only because they are built to last, but because they look really nice both inside and outside.
If you are looking for a awesome truck to get, then I would recommend a Chevrolet Silverado 1500.
