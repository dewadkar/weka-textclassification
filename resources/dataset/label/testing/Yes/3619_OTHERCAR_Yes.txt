            After shopping the market for six months, looking at sport sedans, we settled on the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP.  We were first attracted to the sporty lines, but once we got in the drivers seat, we were sold.  The GTP comes fully loaded with power everything, moon roof, leather seats, heads up display and 3800 supercharged engine.  The only additional option on our car was the Bose stereo system.

We have owned the GTP for two months now and have been very impressed with the performance and handling.  There has been no rattles, shakes or mechanical problem.  It has had problems with the Bose sound system every since purchase.  The dealer has tried to fix it 3 times now and just keeps creating new problems.  Unfortunately, engine mechanics don't know much about high end audio electronics on top of their hearing being shot.  The latest problem they created, a high pitch squeal coming from one of the rear speakers, the service department can't even hear.  We took it to a stereo shop and they could hear it, but if they touched the car it would void the warranty.  The Pontiac dealer refuses to subcontract the work out, so were giving them one more shot, then we're going to the Pontiac regional office.

If you don't know what the heads up display is, you will have to test drive a car with it.  I can bet you will love it.  All vital information is projected onto the lower portion of the windshield, right in front of the driver.  You don't have to take your eyes off the road to see your speed or change radio stations.  Once you have this feature, you'll never want to give it up.

The leather seats are very comfortable and you could stay in them for hours on a long road trip.  The drivers side is heated, it would be nice if the passengers side was also.  I'm 6'4&quot; and fit very comfortably in the rear.  To me, that is roomy for a rear seat!

You will never want for more power, this car has plenty.  The car is very stiff and you feel you are in direct contact with the road.

We are very impressed with the car and would highly recommend it, even with the stereo problem, they have been a frustration more than anything else.<br><br>
