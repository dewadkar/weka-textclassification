            The Mitsubishi Mirage is a compact car.  I really like this car.  It's affordable and it's comfortable.  It is an automatic, four door car.  Since I have a step son this was the ideal car for us to have.  There is plenty of room for my step son and still room enough for company.  This car is great on mileage but it isn't a car that goes fast like some of the other Mitsubishi's.

When looking for a car, Mitsubishi was not what I wanted.  In fact, I have always been an Oldsmobile kind of girl.  I like Oldsmobile's because I have yet to have any problems with them.  However, I was on a tight budget when we went looking for a car and we couldn't afford anything too expensive and we did have to think of my fiance's son.  I wanted a four door car because our last car which was a Mercury Cougar which was a two door and very difficult to get a child in.  Even before that we had a Mustang Convertible but of course, due to Cory we had to get rid of it.

So on we went looking for a car and my father suggested I go to a friend of his.  We were not expecting to walk out with a car that day because our Mercury Cougar was a piece of junk and we didn't think we could trade it in.  But we were lucky to find a great salesman.  So we bought the car that day with my absolute favorite thing, an automatic car starter.  I am from Massachusetts so it gets cold so we hate to have to go and warm our cars up.  That was great for us, considering Cory and I occasionally take my brother to school.

We looked at the car and we liked it.  We took a test drive and it ran great and it had everything automatic, which is always a plus for me.

We purchased this car a year ago and have had no problems whatsoever.  This is great small car for a small family.  It's affordable, comfortable, has everything you need and it's great on gas and mileage.

I don't suggest this car for anyone who likes sports cars or anything fast or for anyone who has a big family.
