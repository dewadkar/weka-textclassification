            The Acura vigor is one of the nicest cars I have ever ridden in.  The seats are comfortable, the ride couldn't be any quieter, and it handles like a sports car.  Acceleration is exceptional and before you know it you'll be going 100 on the free-way.  To top it off, the Vigor has an excellent look.  This car is a cross between a luxury car and a sports car giving you the best of both worlds.  For the muscle you get with this car the price is not bad at all.  This car is 8 years old and looks better than some of the cars coming out today.  All around this is the best in its class and will probably be the best and last car you ever own.<br><br>
