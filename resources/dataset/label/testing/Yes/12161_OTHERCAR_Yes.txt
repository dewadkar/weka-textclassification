                 I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a new car. I knew the exact features I wanted; 2 door, 5 speed, V6, moon roof, CD player...basically I wanted it loaded. I started my search. Honda Accord? Too expensive. Chevy Monte Carlo? Not much to offer. Mercury Cougar? Clunky. Several "free" cups of coffee later, I was getting no where. On a whim I paid a visit to my local Dodge dealer, I could not take my eyes off a jet black 2002 Dodge Stratus RT.

     The car had everything I wanted. The salesman asked If I wanted to drive it...well, if I have to. Typically on a test drive I would get around the block and maybe cruise the highway. On this drive we rolled 32 miles! All the while the salesman was going through the various features of the car. It was really a good time.

    The RT version will give you a bit of sticker shock, mine rang in just over $25,000. The SE edition is available with many of the like features, however 5 speed and leather are not available on the SE. 

    The handling is excellent, delivering a great ride. The 17 in. rims stick to the road like glue. The interior is roomy and quiet. The back seat is a little cramped. The dashboard is laid out very functionally, shares the same dash as an Eclipse. The turbo-charged 3.0 V6 packs a very serious punch. I feel many speeding tickets are coming my direction until I learn the ways of the cruise control. All of this is wrapped into a sleek aggressive looking body.

   Overall I am pleased with my choice, I will continue with updates as time goes by. Current mileage, 5200. Stay tuned.
