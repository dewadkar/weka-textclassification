            I've owned 3 Saturns.... My 1994 Saturn was just totalled in a car wreck 2 weeks ago.....  I just purchased Saturn #4.... Of all the cars I could have chosen to replace my 1994 Saturn with, I chose another Saturn.

My daughter and I were t-boned in the passenger side at 47-50 + miles per hour by another vehicle... If we were not in a Saturn I don't think we would have walked away from that crash with nothing more than some bruises, sore muscles, and some scrapes from the shattering glass.

Saturn builds a quality product, not to mention durrable, and practically maintenance/repair free.

If you ever wonder what would be a good car to buy, GET A SATURN, and wonder no more.... Once you buy one, you will know why people who own Saturns keep buying Saturns....<br><br>
