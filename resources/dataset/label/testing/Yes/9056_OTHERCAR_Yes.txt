            I look for engineering excellence in all aspects of my life and I have to tell you about the performance and dependability of the BMW 3-Series! These cars are engineered for high performance and excuse me,EverReady... It is the BMWs that keep going and going and going and going....

I bought my first 325is new in 1987 and proceeded to put 365,511 tough miles on it in 12 years.  I thoroughly enjoyed driving that car.  All I did was change the oil faithfully myself and do normal maintenance on my own.  I live on a farm and our dirt lane is ~1.5 miles long and full of potholes and curves... it performed masterfully summer and winter.  It got 26 to 28 mpg right up until the end.  The interior leather lasted the full twelve years despite lots of kids and abuse.  Only my driver seat started to fray a little on the side nearest the door where I would slide in each time.  The radio and tape player never failed to fill the interior with quality sound for 12 years.  It was gentle on tires and brakes and I only replaced the clutch once.  I have owned Chryslers, Volvos, and Chevys but these manufacturers cannot touch the BMW 3-Series.

It was not until I had worn the engine and the body out that I finally traded it in on my '93 325ic.  This red ragtop is almost identical to my first 325 with the added fun of the convertible top.  It handles great and draws lots of attention as I cruise along.  I got this convertible in March 1999 (used) at a dealership in Wilmington, Delaware for $16,000 with 46,700 miles in immaculate condition.  I now have 80,000 and it has performed just like the first one.... perfectly.  The engine is designed with excellence in mind and in the final analysis these cars are super economical.  I would have gone through at least two new cars to get the performance and longevity that I got from the BMW.  

There is little about these cars that I can cite as a con.  I replaced the muffler once in 12 years never had to replace a wheel bearing or do internal engine repairs.  The BMWs are well worth the small additional cost and if taken care of will serve the owner dependably well past the 300,000 mile milestone. Get a 325is or ic and I guarantee you will love it and sound just like me in a few years.  Happy motoring!
