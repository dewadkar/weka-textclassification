            Without a doubt Toyota makes the best trucks whether it's dependability or styling.  I just came from buying a 1998 Tacoma 4x2 and this is the best two wheel drive truck, period.  At a little over ten thousand it's also the best price.  It's extremely solid feeling and handles well in the corners.  The 2.4 litre four cylinder engine feels as if it has the power of a larger engine.  This truck delivers plenty of top end and torque.  With the power it produces and the way it handles, driving is extremely fun.  As always the ergonomic layout is great.  Everything is within easy reach and simple to operate.  The only thing I have a little problem with is the bench seat.  I'm not a fan of the bench because I'm almost six-two but it's bearable.  Otherwise it's a terrific truck.  It's perfect for someone who doesn't want a high maintenence vehicle.  And when it is time to work on it the engine is spaced out enough to get your hands in and move around.<br><br>
