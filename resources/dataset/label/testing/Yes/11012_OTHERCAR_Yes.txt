            My husband got a &quot;steal&quot; when he was able to purchase this van.  It seems the previous owner was a married man who had a youthful indescretion with someone other than his wife.  When the wife found out, the van had to go, and fast!

Some good points are that you ride high with excellent visability.  The  controls are all easily accessible with comfortable seating.  Also, the extended 7 passenger is really roomy.  And if you take out the back seat, it is huge.  

My only complaint would be that it is not as smooth riding as my Plymouth Voyager, and although it is not a dog, it is not as quick as I would like.  

It has truck like handling, a pulling power.  You are able to pull a jet-ski to whatever else needs to be pulled.  If you like trucks, have a family and need a mini-van, then this would fit your needs perfectly.
