            The BMW Z3 coupe is definitly a great car.  Some don't like the looks, but under that shell is a 240hp inline 6 which is more then enough to move this little sucker.  The engine is taken directly from the previous M3.  Obviously the Z3 coupe is much lighter, therefore pick up speed is much quicker.  This car also handles much better then the Z3 convertible.  This is due to the fact that the body of the Z3 is much more stiffer since it has to compensate for a missing top, although both cars have exactly the same suspension type.  I test drove both cars and I have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for looks, and style (overall coolness) the Z3 convertible would be the way to go.  But if you are a pure performance fanatic then the Z3 coupe would race nicer.  I guess you guys reading this also have to take into consideration of the weather you encounter.  It would not be smart to buy the convertible if you lived in the north where it snows 10 months of the year.  You get the picture.  Both are great cars, but one last remark for those who are on a budget.  BMWs are so expensive to maintain.  My parents have a Benz 400 E-class and I have a BMW but my car costs more to maintain.  Their car cost more to buy.  You figure it!<br><br>
