            Basic Details
When I first opened the box to my fuji 2650, it was like love at first site. It came with its own rechargeable batteries, a usb cord, and the finepix viewer program for my computer. The camera was very easy to use to. When looking for a camera I searched at many stores. None of the camera's that I saw had the simplicity that this one did. If you count the 3 scroll buttons, there are only 6 buttons in all. Very easy to use. It has 2 megapixels, which when I was looking for a camera I was told that is the least amount of megapixels that you want for picture quality reasons. This camera has a 2.5x optical zoom and a 3x digital zoom. You can also take 20 second movie clips. 

Memory
This last spring I went on a trip to London, England, and my camera made it an experience that I'll be able to remember through my albums. The camera came with a 16mb memory card, but I didn't think that was enough. I bought a 128mb memory card just a few weeks before I went on the trip. This made it so easy I would charge its batteries every night, and all I had to do was take pictures. I didn't even use up half of the memory card. For the $80 that I paid for the memory card it wasn't really worth it. You can get different amounts of pictures on your memory card depending on what quality you have the pictures set at. The better the quality of the picture, the less pictures you can put on a memory card.

Picture Quality
It takes great pictures. The only problem with the pictures is when you are moving even a little bit the pictures sometimes turn out blurry. Standing still the pictures turn out excellent. You can change the quality of your pictures too, as I said earlier. Changing the picture quality also effects how far the camera lets you zoom in. The lowest quality setting lets you zoom in farther than the highest setting

Battery Life
This is one thing that comes to mind when dealing with electronics like these. It comes with it own rechargeable batteries, but I would suggest getting energizer rechargeable batteries. You get more life from the energizer battery, and you really won't be able to find any more fuji batteries. The batteries if you do it right will last for about 100-150 pictures. That is if you aren't leaving it on for long periods of time.

Finepix Viewer
This came with the camera and is a program that allows you to view, print, arrange, and (depending on what type of photo editing programs are on your computer) easily drag and drop thumbnails to edit. It was a very easy program to put on my computer too. It only took about 5 minutes. Very easy to work with. 

The 3 Modes
There are three modes on this camera. There is a "shoot" mode (where you take the pictures), a "viewer" mode (where you view you pictures and short movies), and a "movie" mode (where you are able to take 20 second movies). The only problem with the movie mode is that there is no sound, and personally I think the quality sucks. I don't think there is any real reason why the "movie" mode is on the camera. Its not really that helpful. 

Final Thoughts
As my first digital camera this was an excellent choice. Very simple and compact. Needs to have a little bit better zoom, but for the most part this an all around tight digital camera.
