            This easy-to-use compact digital camera doesn't sacrifice image quality or features. The 2.11 megapixel, 1/2 inch CCD achieves dazzling image quality, offering both 1600 x 1200 (UXGA) and 640 x 480 (VGA) pixel sizes. Digital beginners and old timers alike will enjoy the Coolpix 800. 

Fully automatic focus, flash, metering and white balance make it a snap to take great snapshots. The 3-mode metering on spot, center-weight, and matrix yields accurate exposures, plus the macro mode lets you get within 2.8 inches of the subject. Images can be saved in uncompressed TIFF format, which gives you superb resolution but consumes the most memory, or in one of three JPEG compression modes, The supplied 8MB CompactFlash memory card stores up to 200 highly compressed images. Even though the Coolpix 800 is packed with advanced features, it's still easy to use. The LCD panel with adjustable back light shows photos before and after you take them. However, if the LCD washes out in the sunlight, or if you want to conserve battery juice by turning off the LCD, you can preview your shot with the real image optical viewfinder, which features an 85% frame coverage and LED indicators for Focus Ready and Speedlight Ready status. 

The Coolpix 800 runs on four AA batteries (included) or an AC adapter  2.5x digital zoom permits the use of Nikon's optional wide-angle, fish-eye, and telephoto lenses.
