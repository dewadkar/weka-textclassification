            I have a royal blue Saturn SL 1999. It was given to me new. It is a standard. Even though I love my car, there are a few things I would like to change about it. 

I like the way the backs of the back seat will fold down either all together or in two other different ways. That way you can put long things in your car without having to leave your trunk open, going 20 miles an hour hoping it won't fall out.

The trunk is pretty roomy.

I also like the easy access to the jack and spare tire...and for those who need it, very easy instructions on how to change a tire. I had gotten a flat tire in the rain about three weeks ago. I was also in a skirt and was trying to figure out an easy, safe way to do this. I popped the trunk to get the jack...and I was on my way in 5 minutes.

I do not like that it does not have cruise control. It sucks on that 6 hour drive to Houston. Although you can pay more when purchased, to have it installed...wish I had paid just a little more.

Also about traveling, the seats tend not to be very comfortable after a few hours.

I also don't like that the steering wheel will not go up and down more. I always have a hard time getting out when I wear a skirt because the steering wheel doesn't go up further. 

But overall, it is a great little car.<br><br>
