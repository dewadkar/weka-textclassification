            We bought this car last November for my wife. We really love this car. It gets great gas mileage. We bought the GXE model of this car. I believe there are three variations to this car. There is one model over the one we bought. Ours has all the bells and whistles that we wanted. (CD, Remote lock entry). It did not have fog lights. Nissan wanted $500 to put them in. My friend put them in for $20 (plus a lunch) and I bought the lights at an automotive store for about $50. 

The only bad thing and its really not that bad, is the lack of legroom in the back seats. It is very small. So don't let someone who is 6 feet sit in the back unless you are torturing them. 

The sound system is good. Could be a little bit better with better speakers.

The car gets about 35 miles per gallon. The transmission is good, however it is only a four cylinder car so take that into consideration if you live in a hilly environment.

The trunk space is good for a small car. We can fit all of our weekend junk and go visit friends in other towns. That's including a cooler and all of our luggage.
