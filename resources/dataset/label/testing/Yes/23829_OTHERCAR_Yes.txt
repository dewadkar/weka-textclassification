            Before buying a cheap new car, I researched the car magazines.  They told me which cars in this class deserved a look.  The Focus and Echo stood out.  The Echo's roominess, gas mileage, price, and expected reliability were very attractive.  I sat in each, and was impressed by the interior packaging of both.  I am 6'4&quot;, so headroom was a big deal.  I don't care about styling, as a cheap car is a transportation tool only to me, not a rolling sculpture.  I appreciated the fact that the car is offered in a very &quot;basic&quot; version, giving me a chance to spend no more than I wanted for things I don't really need.  Remember, this class of car needs to be cheap, reliable, and functional.  Tenacious road grip, beautiful styling, luxury equipment, a quiet, smooth ride, etc. are unnecessary on a basic car.  The first 20 miles in the car made me very happy I had chosen the Echo.  I love the room inside, and all the storage space.  The trunk is huge for this size car.  I can haul 8 foot lumber and close the trunk, with a few inches to spare between the wood and the dash.  Those fold-down rear seats are great for dog-hauling, too.  I commute 90 miles per day, split evenly between highway and city.  My last full tank of gas returned 40.02 miles per gallon, going 70-85 on the highway, with lots of stop-and-go city driving.  Yes, the interior is fairly noisy at highway speeds, but soundproofing costs money.  Being very light, the car does get moved around a little more (at highway speeds in strong wind) than a heavy one, but that just requires small steering adjustments.  It doesn't bother me at all, and in no way does it feel excessive.  The very high (for a small car) seating position is nice, the car feels like a tiny minivan inside.  I really don't hate, or even dislike, anything about this car at all.  I bought a 2-door, giving very easy access, and a 5-speed, giving better economy and acceleration.  I have no complaints about the handling, steering, braking, transmission, or engine.  In fact, there is no more economical 8.5 second 0-60 mph car out there.  Not even close.  The Neon and Focus ZX3 also do 8.5 seconds, but get about 25 mpg.  I would recommend this car for anyone who has anywhere near the same priorities as me.  The Civic lacks headroom, the Corolla is less roomy and $2500 more, and everything else is less reliable or more expensive.  <br><br>
