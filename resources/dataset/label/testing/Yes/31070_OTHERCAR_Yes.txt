                I test drove a Tundra today. I found some things impressive, somethings that were not, and overall I am not the least bit swayed in my affection for my future truck, the F150.

Engine: I have to give credit where credit is due. The 4.7 liter i-force is one awesome powerplant. It is without a doubt the most sophisticated, smoothest, and quickest revving engine offered in a truck today, though not necessarily the best truck engine, but we'll get to that later. The sports car lover in me loved this engine. I had to floor it to get out of the lot and merge onto the boulevard and I did, with the salesman's encouragement. Now let me remind you that I am used to my Ranger 4 banger, which has enough power to keep me out of trouble but nothing more. I gassed it and in the time it usually takes my Ranger to wind itself out in first gear at about 30 or so mph the Tundra was already at 60. You really have to try it to believe the incredible acceleration on this truck. They say it's the fastest full sized pickup built and once you drive it you will not doubt.  I still am amazed at the memory of sitting there watching the speedo needle leap to 60 so fast I could have sworn I did it in about 5 seconds and thinking to myself that a truck is not supposed to be this quick. At speed all I had to do is downshift and the Tundra leapt forward as that sweet V8 snarled a smooth yet ferocious note.
    I thought to myself, damn, this is how a V8 should sound. At cruise and at light acceleration you could only hear a muted hum but floor it and it snarled and gurgled aggressivley enough to let me know this was not the usual sissy V6 under the hood but never became intrusive or obnoxious. Undoubtedly the best sounding V8 in any truck in my opinion.
     My only problem was it seemed too peaky. You could never go wrong by flooring it but the low rpm torque deficiency made itself known in certain low speed acceleration situations in which if you caught the transmission of guard and didn't get a downshift you were left with little power. That's one thing I liked about the domestics. Even if you dial in half throttle you still get a healthy burst of speed from the high displacement V8's.
   The peakiness of this engine does not make it the best candidate for extremely heavy towing or hauling. It is practically a sports car engine. It'll out drag most competitors but it might be a different story if the smallish high revving V8 is saddled with a very heavy trailer.
Transmission: 
      Always quick to downshift, and it never bumped into gear. The only problem was at times I felt stuck in too high a gear at lower speeds.

Stereo: The one I drove had the in dash 6 CD changer and tape deck. An extremely convinient way to go. Unlimited music options and you don't have to stop the car and pull over to load or change CD's from a cartridge. It's all nice and neat in the dash. Plus, the sound system is more impressive than any I've heard in the competition. Sound was clear, the base was strong, and you could get it plenty loud. Of course I'd still probably add in a  sub and an amp, as good has never been good enough for me.

Interior: This was my major problem. There just wasn't enough space. Maybe the buckets contributed to the sense of claustrophobia, I don't know. But I am not about to spend 23,000$ for a truck when It doesn't even feel like it gives me any more wiggle room than my tiny little Ranger. Toyota needs to open it up a bit. Americans don't like that 'intimate' feeling in trucks. We tend to be large people and like lots of hip, head, and legroom, which were all deficient in the Toyota. It's like they took a compact truck interior and built a full sizer around it.

Ergonomics: If you've driven a Camry or corolla you can figure out the Tundra in no time. Every thing is intuitively placed and marked and within easy reach. The visibility though I thought was not so good due to the headrest design, which seemed to make it difficult to check my blind spots.

Ride: Wasn't the silky smooth luxury car ride I hear Tundra enthusiasts rant about. I could felt some jiggling by the smaller bumps more than I thought it should have been in this 'Luxury car of trucks.' The F150 felt better.

Handling: Felt a bit too soft. Seems like Toyota tried to dial the suspension in for a creamy smooth ride at the expense of flatter cornering but didn't even achieve the ride they were aiming for.

Styling: I like it. Smooth, contemporary, modern looking but not by any means bold or risky like the F series or Ram. I'm starting to notice though that Toyota tends to compensate for the smallishness of its trucks by making them sit a little higher. Not that it annoys me but I think they need to build a real full size truck rather than creating the illusion of one.

Maneuverability: It's smaller than the domestics, and consequently it felt easier to judge and position in tight spots.

Overall 9/10 of the capability of the domestics but much more drivable and a hot rod engine to boot.

  If you want the most capable half ton money can buy look elsewhere, but if you want a full size pickup bed,  need to tow a moderately sized trailer, and/or still want to be able to seat 4 or five in reasonable enough comfort for short to medium trips that they do not walk away vowing never to ride in your backseat again, go for the Tundra.<br><br>
