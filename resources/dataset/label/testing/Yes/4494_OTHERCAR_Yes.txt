            It doesn't seem that long ago that I was scowling at the idea of having to be seen behind the wheel of a minivan, but then came the kids.  

We purchased our 1995 Villager approximately two years ago (it was used when we bought it).  It has a been a joy to drive ever since.  I was afraid that it would be too big for me to maneuver and to judge distance when parking, but that hasn't been the case.  It has the feel of a car, but gives us the room we need for two adults and three children in car seats.  

Because we have small children, I also liked the fact that there is not a passenger side airbag (although I confine them to the back seats at this point).

My only disappointments are with lack of storage space and the time it takes to air condition the back seats in hot weather.  My parents own a newer Ford Windstar that has air vents which lead to the rear seats, so perhaps the newer model Villagers have made this change as well.  The only problem we've incurred is with the sliding side door closing accidently while on inclines.  That is to say, when the van is on any kind of incline the side door has a habit of sliding closed when we intend it to stay open.  We've learned to supervise the kids when they are climbing in and out because the door has almost closed on them.

Overall, I would indeed purchase another Villager, but might look a little closer at all the options.  But for the price we paid, I definitely feel that we made a wise choice on this minivan.
