            I bought a used 1992 Saturn with 79,000 miles in excellent condition at the beginning of 1999 after a horrid accident in my Honda civic. When looking for a car, i perused for one that wouldnt' crush like a tin can, as my Honda so righteously did. Once i test drove the Saturn, i knew this was my sturdy, stick to the ground, vehicle.
I love my Saturn, but there are a few things to look out for. the early design of the Saturn coupe was not thoroughly though out. During the rainy season, forget about rolling down your window. Water will flood in past the weather stripping and douse you. The same goes for the trunk. 
because of the round back of the trunk, one would think, &quot;a lip!&quot; to catch the water and redirect it. No such luck. And forget about using the windshield wipers with your driver window down. The water whips around the corner and into the car.
I've also come across a problem with the motorized seatbelts. Both the passenger and driver side motors have died on me. This a repair (if done by Saturn)will set you back $500 per side!  You can always go the cheap way by making sure that both belts are locked in proper place, and then go in to remove the fuse. This will ensure that your belt doesnt' stop midway and draw attention from the cops.
Even though i've come across these problems, i really do love my car. it handles well, with little to no play in the steering and the ride is smooth! In the rain, and through windy weather conditions, this car is sturdy. I'm secure with the fact that this car will not blow away in harsh wind or send me careening into a bank of a divider wall. Not only that, but the Saturn Coupe has great pick up/power for a 4 cyclinder vehicle. 
A family with a child still in a carseat, would not want this vehicle for practical purposes. The tight squeeze in and out of the backseat will get loathsome. But to all others that want a sporty, practical and safe vehicle, i highly recommend it.
