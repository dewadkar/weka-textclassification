            Digital cameras will become ubiqitious this year.  One thing that shocked me with Kodak is the costumer service.  These people are great!  Digital cameras are not as easy to use as traditional ones, and the super customer service has made me real happy.  

The picture quality for web pages and e-mail is great, but normal pictures take some getting used to.  I have a an HP inkjet and with the special photo paper, pictures look a little computerized.  I think it will work better with a laser printer.  This camera has a ton of features, along with the software, that let's me take some amazing pictures.  The software is a little difficult to use at first, but the amount of things it does makes it worthwhile.  For example, I altered a picture of my son to look like I did a charcoal drawing of him.  You can cut and paste all kinds of things into and out of the pictures.  

I use the recharable batteries and Kodak threw in an extra memory card.  I have had no problems with power or space on the camera for pictures.

Digital cameras are here to stay and the prices will only get better.  With Kodak quality and the great customer service, I would highly recommend the DC 280.<br><br>
