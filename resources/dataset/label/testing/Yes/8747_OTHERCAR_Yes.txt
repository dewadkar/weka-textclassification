            The PDR-M70 3.3 mega-pixel camera from Toshiba is enjoyable to use and provides a flawless output. It is compact and sleek with a curved silver metallic body and built in flash.

The various program modes, including portrait, landscape, action, and night photogrpahy, can be accessed via icons on the side on the LCD preview display. It is also possible to choose shutter-priority or apeture-priority modes. This feature is great for those more advanced photographers who want to take advantage of more than the traditional point-and-shoot mentality. Unfortunately, the 4-way jog button the camera is difficult to use because it is so small and sometime you cant tell if the command registered with the camera.

One really cool feature is the multi-shot mode which snaps 36 low-resolution images at 15 frames per second. The images are saved as one file and you can turn it into a movie on your computer. However, like most 3.3Mega-pixel digital camera, it also has a video recorder capability. Another few features are the light histogram shown when you take a picture to tell you how well the subject is lighted and the LCD backlight. Toshiba provides an image resolution changing feature whereby if you run out of room in high-res pictures, you can resize them all to low-res on the fly in order to keep taking pictures.

Installation of USB was simple and straightforward as was the image editor provided, ImageExpert. Overall, a great camera for the price!
