            This is a family car with some kick!  My family bought a new 1996 Accord and it still runs like new.  It is quite fun to drive, great pickup and it has a VERY reasonable price tag.  It is a well built car and we have had virtually no problems with it at all.  About 60,000 miles on it now and it still performs like it is brand new.  We love our accord, you'll love yours too!

We bought this vehicle because of a friends recommendation.  He happened to be a car salesman for Honda, but we could honestly tell that he BELIEVED in the vehicle, unlike other car salesmen who just sell them.  We have not been disappointed.

What I don't like.  I wish it was a convertible.   Nothing major.  It's an overall very good car.<br><br>
