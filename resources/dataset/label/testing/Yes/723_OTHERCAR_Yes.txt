            I bought my first eclipse in 93 - a year later I heard they were coming out with a convertible and I just had to have one.  I finally traded in my 93 for the 97 GS Spyder.  I love this car in the spring, summer, and fall.  

As far as mechanically... I have 65,000 miles and the only problem I've had is my back passenger window broke when it was about 1/2 way down.  It was covered under the warranty, so no $$ out of my pocket.  

I only have 2 complaints about this car - compared to the interior of my 93 eclipse (which I absolutely loved), the interior of this car is a lot cheaper, more plastic, seats aren't as comfortable and nice, and the interior is not layed out as well.   But if you've never been in a early model eclipse, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that they've skimped on the interior.  

Second complaint -- Who's bright idea was it to put the stereo where you can't eject the CD from the single CD player when you're in 1st, 3rd, or 5th gear!?!?!  MAJOR oversight on the engineers who designed the interior!!  If they would have stuck with the short shifter instead of the cheesy, tall shifter, this would not have been a problem.  (oops was that a 3rd complaint?)

But overall, I Love this car (I'm just not crazy about the interior but I love the way it looks and drives!)<br><br>
