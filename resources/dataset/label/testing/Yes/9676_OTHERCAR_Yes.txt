            This is a great sporty little car.  Easy on the wallet, dependable, low maintenance, and stylish design.  I've had mine for 2 years and I love it! This car is comfortable to drive and maneuvers well.  Gas mileage is a plus.  One tank of gas will last me a week of commutes to work. The downside to this car is it's high back-end.  Visibility is poor when looking behind you. The use of side mirrors remedies this when driving, but you must use caution when backing from a driveway.  Watch out for the tricycle! Fun to drive in town and on the highway..I would recommend this car for the college student to the senior citizen driver.  <br><br>
