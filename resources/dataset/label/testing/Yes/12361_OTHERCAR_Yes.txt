            After driving used vehicles for years we again opted to go this route when we went car shopping.
I find it much cheaper and you are still getting a fairly new car without paying for all that <i>newness</i> hype.

We shopped around for weeks looking at various makes and models (mostly GM vehicles per my fathers orders..hehe)
After 2 hours of test driving different cars I was about to give up because I was sick of the salesman telling me that &quot;<i>This is the perfect car for you!&quot;</i>
I do not trust salesman so it didn't matter what he told me--there was no way on this earth I was going to drive a cramped little car with no power.

On our way out of the car lot I spied this funny looking car way at the end of all the others (I think they were hiding it)so I asked to test drive it also.

As soon as I got in it I knew it was going to be roomy enough for a family of four--my main quest in searching for a car. <i>Airconditioning came in second to leg room.</i>

My car is the GS model and it is perfect. Loaded with everything including <i> heated mirrors!</i>

<b>Some features</b>--
A/C
AM/FM cassette--CD...but I can't find mine (I think the previous owner maybe lost it..lol)
Cruise Control
Tilt Steering
Overdrive
Power windows/mirrors/trunk/locks
Heated mirrors
Child safety locks on back doors

The best thing about this car is the way it drives. It is a very quiet car and handles like nothing I have ever driven before.

The trunk in this car is HUGE. Could easily fit 4 bodies in there if you had to. (kidding of course!)
The back seats have a 60/40 split so you can access the trunk this way also. Great for storing kids toys or great for easy access to that body back there you thought was imobolized but really isn't. (kidding again!)

Overall, this is a great family car because of the room and ability to lock your kids in the backseat with no fear of them jumping out on the highway.

If I do ever buy a <i>new</i> car I would definately consider going to Ford. Please don't tell my father!

Oh...for all the men out there--V6 in it. Means nothing to me but thought I should throw that in there.

*As far as the CD player is concerned...it seems to have disappeared before I bought this car. It would have been nice to have one but I can settle for just listening to the radio.

<i>Yes, I looked in the trunk and it's not in there either.</i> :-D
