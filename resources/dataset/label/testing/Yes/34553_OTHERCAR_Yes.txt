            It's a great SUV for someone who really just needs a tough and rugged way to get around town or make a trip to Home Depot.  It is much wider than any SUV in its class.  The appointments are good, fit is great and the stereo cranks. Fully loaded, there isn't much to want for.  Handles the mild off-road sufficiently, snow/ice no problem at all. Yes it handles.  Good thing is you rarely see another on in your rear view mirror.  This baby is the king of the road.  It is outperformed by nothing in speed, durability, and control.  If I had to buy a 2nd car now, it would be the QX4!!!
