            This is how well I think the Ranger fares with gas mileage and general handling.  I bought this vehicle as my first one, in part because of how it looked and the opinions of others that I had heard or read.

For the size of the vehicle, the size of the tank, and the engine, I feel it does quite well on gas mileage.  Mine has a 16.5 gal. tank.  Although you may fill your tank more often, in the long run you should be spending less than most other trucks on gas.  As would be expected, there will be a mileage difference between different size engines.  But for the most part, I have seen that it does quite well with keeping it's gas requirements down.  I have noticed that a manual transmission will generally burn less than an automatic.

There are a couple handling problems that I have noticed in my own and several other Rangers I have driven.  Granted, this might not be a universal case with the vehicle, but it has surfaced enough times to where I think I should mention it.  The steering seems quite sloppy on these trucks (actually I have noticed this on Ford trucks other than the Ranger series as well).  There is power steering, but it is very loose, and seems to have much play in it when changing directions on the wheel.  I have noticed about an inch of side to side play before the column will turn.  The other thing I think should be mentioned, and once again may not be true for all, is how the suspension fares.  Like any vehicle, it has the basic shock and spring suspension.  But I've noticed that when going over bumps in the road the whole truck seems to take a hard hit.  It will suddenly jar the whole truck.  A good place to notice this is in the dashboard, where I would not recommend installing any kind of CD player for this reason.<br><br>
