            I purchased my 2003 Accord EX-V6 just one month ago.  I've already driven it nearly 2,000 miles, and am very impressed with the Accord's overall quality and performance.

I purchased my redesigned Accord as a replacement for a 2000 Mazda 626.  The differences are remarkable.  My "other car" is a 2002 Passat, so I have a high-quality benchmark for comparison.

The Accord is tight, handles well, and has acceleration that will impress all but the most jaded driver.  The climate control system is excellent, providing good air circulation throughout the vehicle compartment. 

The five speed automatic shifts smoothly under all driving conditions, and the V6 gives very good mileage (30MPH highway and 22 city, on regular, unleaded fuel). 

There is more than adequate trunk, leg, and shoulder room.  The Accord provides good interior storage for maps, sun glasses, cell phones, etc.

I only wish the Accord offered a few "bells and whistles" available on high line vehicles, such as memory seat adjustment and 8-way power passenger seats.
