            We bought a 1995 about 2 years ago second hand and we looked at all the mini vans and this was by far the best one. We like the crash test they did on it saying it is one of the top or is the top of the list for safety! Its comfortable, ours is sporty looking as we got a &quot;Fun&quot; color, its teal and its so pretty and I too always dreamt of a mustang..some day and then 4 children later its the car for us. We have had hardly any trouble with it. We did just have a recall on it for head gasket, but that was fine, it was free!! Runs so nice on the road. Ours is pretty loaded and the dual heat and air is awesome!! We are looking forward to buying the new 2001 when our time is up.  Nothing I hate about it. I just love it. Any family or person who is into sales this van is for you!  I can not say enough about this van.  It gets great gas milege and its roomy and the seats move easily and can come out. Nice storage areas, and so forth! If your looking for a great van..BUY THIS ONE!<br><br>
