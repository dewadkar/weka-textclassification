            Digital cameras are a must for the 'gotta have all the latest toys' folk, and Nikon is a name you can trust.  The Coolpix 800 is a neat (expensive) toy, and a graphically and technically exceptional tool.

The singular drawback (here's where a major expense comes in) is that when using the screen, it eats up batteries at an alarming rate.  After just a few hours of using the display, the four batteries are spent. There's an adapter available, but it took calling camera shops and outlets in two states to find one (Nikon was no help at all), and if you're out and about, there's an obvious shortage of outlets to enable usage of the adapter. (There's also the option of purchasing recharge-able batteries, but they are costly.)

If you're aware of the TOTAL cost up front and are prepared to spend the initial cost of the product and the additional cost to keep it functional, you've got yourself a great digital camera.<br><br>
