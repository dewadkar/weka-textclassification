            I have had this car for a little over 6 months and have loved every second.  It has enough power to really move, even with 4 passengers, but not as much as the Altima or the Accord (V6's).  However, it doesn't hit the pocketbook like the Altima or Accord.  I had a very hard time finding a fully loaded V6 with a manual trans, but it was worth the wait.  Exterior styling is very European and the interior is sleek, but could stand to be better quality of materials.  I have added my own powered amp to the stock subwoofer and it sounds like I thought it should.  Stereo & CD changer are great (now).  Mazda has been great in service and even responded to my complaint about the speaker (I got a $120 in service credit).  I wish it had better controls for the moon roof and a better travel info center (Dist. to empty, MPG, ect).  This car is not the BMW that Mazda aimed for, but I do love this car and would recommend it to anyone looking for the SPORTS sedan, but not looking for the BMW price.
