            My husband and I just got back from a trip to the mainland yesterday.  We flew to Chicago, and rented this car.  We stayed in Chicago for three days, then drove to New Jersey and stayed there for four days.

When my husband called the rental agency, he didn't know what he wanted.  We usually rent trucks, just because we like trucks, but that would have been quite expensive for this trip so he asked for a larger passenger car so we would be safe and comfortable, while saving a little money.  

<b>First look</b>
When we got there, we were given the Mercury Grand Marquis LS.  Upon first glance, it looks large and roomy, and quite classy.  It has that rounded shape that all the newer cars have these days - but not so rounded that it looked weird.  One weird thing we noticed right away was only the drivers side door has a key slot.  You can't open the car from anywhere but there (it also has a keypad, so you don't need a key to open it, but that is also only on the one door).

<b>Getting in</b>
We put our luggage in the truck, which held our two large bags and three smaller ones easily with enough room left over for two bodies.  That trunk was just <b>huge</b>.  We then got in the car and oriented ourselves with all the buttons, seat controls, etc.  It had cruise control, and a decent radio (standard ford-like issue), a compass in the rear-view mirror, automatic windows and side mirrors and door locks, and tons of seat controls.  The seats really did anything you wanted them to.  There were two buttons for each front seat that let them go up, down, forward, backwards, tilted forward or backward, and raised or lowered the seat.  There was also a lumbar button that would crack your back if you filled it with enough air.  

The seats were a light gray cloth, which was comfortable, but probably not good for spills.  Like all cars with two front airbags, there was no way to put anything on the dasboard.  There were two small cupholders that popped out under the radio, with a tiny ashtray and lighter in between.  I couldn't find any cup holders in the back seat.  There was another lighter slot (good for cellphones and whatnot) in the passenger leg area.  The middle arm rest was divided so passenger and driver could each have their own down or up, or both up making room for a third seat (complete with seatbelt).  There was a lot of legroom, especially if you put your seat all the way back.  There was a trunk-open button on the driver's door.

<b>Driving</b>
We started it up, and boy was it quiet.  I couldn't even tell it was on - a lot different from my own Dodge pickup.  When we started driving, all the doors automatically locked - which my husband really didn't like.  If you left them locked, they would unlock as soon as you opened a door, but only the doors that were opened would unlock.  As we got on the expressway, my husband remarked no less than four times how powerful it was.  The ride was quiet, and smooth.

<b>In the City</b>
This car is big ... making it safer and comfortable, but making parallel parking almost impossible.  I only had to do it once, and luckily I had two spaces to put it in - because squeezing it in right downtown would have been a nightmare.  Other than that, it was good for city driving - good stopping and easy starts.  At one point, we had 6 people in the car easily - everyone with a seatbelt - and no one cramped.

<b>Driving across the country</b>
We drove for two full days, and the car was great.  I don't know what it was, but whomever was in the passenger seat fell asleep almost immediately and didn't wake until the car stopped.  We weren't even tired but the ride was very lulling.  There was plenty of room to stretch out, and the driver was even comfortable.  The only thing I didn't like was the steering pulled to the left.  The car was decent on gas - I don't remember us filling up too much.

All in all, I liked this car a lot.  Obviously, we didn't deal with service or maintenance issues, but the brand will tell you plenty about that.  My husband, who has always driven trucks or SUV's, is even considering getting one - and he drives 3000 miles a month.<br><br>
