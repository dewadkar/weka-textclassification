            We looked around for a sports utility vehicle to replace our 2-door Toyota Corolla. Funny how a two-door sports coupe doesn't quite cut it for a family of two adults and two growing children!

We checked out several SUVs and found that the Grand Vitara fit OUR needs. Our needs included: 4-doors, good handling, ease of parking, and enough interior space for two children under 10 years of age.  We also wanted a good value. Being on a limited budget, we limited ourselves to a mini-SUV. Most of what we saw were 4-cylinder models. The Grand Vitara has enough power with a 6-cylinder engine to move on the highway without holding up traffic.

The Grand Vitara is great to drive. Very good handling with excellent forward and side vision. Really easy to parallel park with the driver-controlled side-view mirrors. The drawback to this vehicle is the limited rear-view vision. You will need to use the side mirrors to see the rear view that you can normally see using the rear-view mirror alone in coupes and vans.

Although this car is used for a family, I would say that couples or families of four or less would like this vehicle the best. This is really not a singles car, nor is it meant to haul large amounts of things.  The rear compartment is adequate for grocery shopping, but don't expect to haul the big and long merchandise back from Costco.

Overall, I would recommend the Grand Vitara for the reasons above.<br><br>
