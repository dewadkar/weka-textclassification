            First the bad news.  The breaking system is marginal but adequate.  Now on to the good and there is plenty.  The vehicle can go through snow and mud that I'd be afraid to try on foot.  I do generally drive gently, however, I have in excess of 140,000 on the original set of tires - yes that's 140K - hard to believe but true.  They were only one step above the standard tires and there was one step higher available.  Incidently, they're Goodyear Wrangler GTs.  Gas milage is about 22mpg and in 140K miles has needed nothing except oil changes.  They are not cheap to purchase but well worth it over the long haul - unless you just like a new vehicle on a more regular basis.<br><br>
