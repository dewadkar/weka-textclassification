            I bought the Canon Powershot A5 by mail order back in January 1999 for about $420 (retail in stores at the time was as high as $599). For that price I think it performed well. It is incredibly compact, and quite stylish.

A plus over some other cameras is the rechargeable battery, though the lifetime seems to have shortened a bit as time goes on.

Pictures are very good (not quite megapixel), but often are rather overexposed with flash. Software supplied is very good. Great for our applications, which were to transfer lots of images over the Internet (for house hunting at a distance, and posting baby pics for distant relatives).

I wish I had waited for the zoom model, which is probably now default.

Make sure you have a case for it - it does not deal well with rough handling from my experience.<br><br>
