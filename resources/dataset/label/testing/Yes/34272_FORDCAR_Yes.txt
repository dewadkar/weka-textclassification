            My husband will ONLY drive a Ford F-150!  His first truck was an F-150.  He bought it new in 1977!  He used this truck for his farm needs as well as everyday driving.  This particular truck is still being used today but only as a farm truck.  

A couple of years ago he decided he needed another truck!  He really didn't like driving a car.  We live in the mountains of North Carolina and a four wheel drive vehicle is a must in the winter.  I convinced him to try some of the other trucks.  I had heard so much about the Dodge Ram and I thought that a  test drive would be good.  The whole time he compared the truck to his Ford.  I could see right away that we would not be purchasing the Dodge.  

His older truck had given him many good years and farming is really hard on a truck.  His decision to buy the Ford was totally based on past experience.  Needless to say, the new truck has held up extremely well.  It has not been used as a farm truck though!  It looks too good for that!  There are not a lot of vehicles that are 23 years old and still running much less doing the job that this old truck does, so I feel strongly that if we were purchasing a new truck today, it would again be a Ford F-150.  <br><br>
