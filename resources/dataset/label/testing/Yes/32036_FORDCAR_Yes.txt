            I bought this car used off lease with 18000 miles. The Car is in very good condition. Ford maintained it extremely well. The car is very comfortable to drive. Several of my friends comment that the ride is not that of a truck but of a stiff car. The exceloration for a six cylinder is outstanding even at highway speed. The car has plenty of room for passengers as well as cargo. However, if you have a bunch of kids to tote around a van would be much better. If you have a 4 people family then this is the vehicle for you. Ford does like it's price tag, however you can haggle down to a reasonable price. That would however depend on the dealer. The interior is roomy both front and back. The controls are in a thoughtful place and easy to reach. The Explorer is the smaller of the SUV line. In city traffic the Explorer handles and parks well. Remember that you are driving a truck not a car. The other two SUV's would probably be difficult to park in a crowded parking lot.<br><br>
