            As a designer by profession, I am exposed to upcoming innovative new products that most consumers have yet to see.  So, upon seeing the preliminary concepts of the Pontiac Aztek, my reaction back then was, to say the least, disturbed.  The current model that will be making its way to the public is actually a &quot;toned down&quot; version from the car show concept.  One can't help but react one way or another when first seeing the Aztek. I can only imagine that the vast majority would not favor the exterior appearance and therefore would not care to see much past its skin.  So, with that said, is beauty only skin deep?  In this case, yes.

The following information is based on facts and research rather than on-hands experience.  Thus, if given the opportunity, I would not hesitate to explore and test drive this curious vehicle that seems to be the center of automotive controversy.

On the outside, the Aztek combines steel with durable protective plastic. This, of course, is not new to the automotive industry and is highly favored by most auto/truck manufacturers.  However, to design a vehicle that utilizes these materials that would benefit the overall design appearance is quite difficult to accomplish.  Albeit that it seems Pontiac struggles to stay within the automotive &quot;new and innovative&quot; wars by its history.  The Aztek is no exception.  Although, Pontiac strives to &quot;push the envelope&quot; in design and ideas, they seem to miss the mark on what the majority of the public wants...something that's not only different but what everyone would definitely drool to own.  The Aztek, unfortunately, tries to include key iconic elements in one tight little package that don't seem to work too well together.  The one obvious element that I couldn't get past was from the infamous Pontiac front grill.  One can't help but notice the blatant &quot;in your face&quot; Pontiac grill that's quite over bearing for a short hood.  Small animals beware since it seems to imply large amounts of front air intake for the engine.  I understand that keeping the design elements in a family of products to imply relations from one model to the next is important in a product line for a company.  However, in the case of the Aztek, the grill opening seems to be quite obtrusive and unproportionate to the front face of the vehicle.  Other views of the vehicle, rear and sides, fare in better shape and it seems that Pontiac is aware of this issue since they tend to advertise the Aztek, mostly, in all other views except for the front.

Getting past the exterior shell, however, the Aztek has somewhat of a decent and appealing interior.  This vehicle features quite a few basic luxury amenities such as power locks, windows and mirrors, cruise control, alarm system, air condition, and keyless remote entry.  Beyond that you can get an adjustable cargo net that can be reconfigured in 22 different ways, an overhead console, a driver's information center, dual zone heating and air condition, a roof rack system, am/fm/cd stereo 6-speaker system, a 4-way manual driver's side seat adjuster, front door utility packs, and much more.  

A few of the innovative and different approaches that I thought was clever was the center console that turns into a portable drink cooler, a collapsible sliding cargo rear shelf, and a camping package that includes a tent and a fitted air mattress which utilizes the rear hatch of the Aztek for those who are adventurous towards the outdoors.

Under the hood includes a 3.4 ltr. V-6 4-speed engine that produces good power and acceleration when tackling steep hills and inclines.

In respect, the automotive designers at Pontiac, really tried hard to fill the missing niches that consumers would like to see filled in with all the automotive gadgets and gizmos.  It seems that perhaps they had decided to design starting from the inside and on the way out they ran out of time and budget.  In my opinion, Pontiac deserves a little credit for pushing the envelope for being different and innovative.  The Aztek may prove to be an example of design that's way ahead of it's time.  What may seem disturbing now may actually be hot 10 years from now.  However, sometimes trying to be different, prematurely, in the extreme lengths can be costly and damaging to the reputation of an automotive company.  I must admit that after researching information about this vehicle, I've gotten used to it's appearance and actually grown to appreciate it in a utilitarian (lack of a better word) sort of way.  

I personally would not purchase this vehicle.  But I do admire the people who had the cajones to design and introduce it to the public.  And even more so to those that want to break free from the conservative majority of cookie-cutter vehicles and venture into the land of the small and vastly growing world of diversity and change.<br><br>
