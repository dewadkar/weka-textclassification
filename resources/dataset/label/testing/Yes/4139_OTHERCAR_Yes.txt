            Acura Built one of the best cars out in the market back in 1987 when it introduced the Acura Legend, then in 1991 it redesigned the Legend, not only cosmetics but upgrading the engine size to 3.2 liters.  The sedan version which I personally own, has plenty of power and then some for a luxury car. It is very comfortable and has stylish interior.  Acura in my opinion has the best looking interior of ALL cars out there, better then Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Ferrari, and any car that cost thousands more.  The car is very reliable, having to do only minor work such as changing the tire form wear and tear, changing your oil every three thousand miles, and other minor things.  

Driving this car feels like you own an expensive piece of Japanese hardware.  The luxury of having everything electronic, mirrors, heated mirrors, anti-lock brakes, leather seats, sunroof, cd-changers, premium surround sound, the works.  

I definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone on a lower budget get the Acura Legend 91-95.  It's a beautiful piece of artwork.  Used prices ranges from $7,000 for a high mileaged 91 to $20,000 for an excellent 95 Legend.  Coupe is definitely recommend.<br><br>
