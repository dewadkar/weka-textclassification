            I heard that it was the least expensive car on the market.  The base price with no extras is around $12,000(that was for a 2000).  It is pretty much maintenance free, except for the oil changes.  It runs fantastic, smooth and with power, but I must recommend spending the extra money for duel cams. 

 With only four cylinders, it gets good gas mileage, but if you want to get across the street in a hurry, I would definitely, with no exception, get the duel cams. Driving up the steep mountain on the way to Asheville, it past everyone else up.

It comes with an abundance of drink holders, but if you are a smoker, watch out.  You will have to spend the extra money for an ashtray and cigarette lighter.  What's the world coming to?  It use to be, you could at least use the ashtray to throw your coins in. 

The only cons I have found so far, is that the music system is only so so, (I guess I was spoiled with one of my other cars with six speakers).  I also noticed it was noisy when I had the windows down.  I had given up my Van which was high off the ground, to go into this, and the noise from the street was noticeably louder.
