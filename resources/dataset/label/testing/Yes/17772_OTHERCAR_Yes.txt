            Buy a Saturn!
 It's a great car.
 I have had my Saturn for about 3 years now. The only work done to the vehicle since I purchased it has been regular oil changes. The car is compact enough for easy handling in parking lots and on busy interstates. It handles great and rides comfortably, with roomy front seats. The back seats can be a little crowded for adults, but mine only hold our kids, so it's comfortable and roomy for them as well. 
I have driven on several trips exceeding 500 miles and on a few exceeding 1000 miles, and have never had any real trouble from the vehicle. The only minor problem I have encountered at all is the automatic fastening seatbelt, (from time to time )decides to slide forward and backward as if I were opening and closing the door.(which I'm not of course I'm driving) It can prove to be distracting if your driving. However, if your husband is driving, it can prove to be an amusing site. 
I would highly recommend a Saturn to anyone wishing to purchase a sporty, family sized car, with an affordable price and good gas mileage.  <br><br>
