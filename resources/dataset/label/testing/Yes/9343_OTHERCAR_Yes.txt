            I have spent some real driving time in this car.  Recently, I drove the '99 from Ann Arbor to Traverse City - about 5 hours.  The ride was pretty pleasant.  The power of this model blows previous Lexus models away.  It had much better acceleration than any of the American SUVs.  The amenities are also a differentiator - they are very thoughtful.  The climate control is quick and accurate, and the 6-CDs in dash allowed me to change discs while driving, since I listened to them all. The sound system is superb.

The cargo space was adequate for 4 people and 2 dogs, plus gear.  We didn't use any roof rack space.

My only issue was the driver's leg room, and none of my co-travellers shared my concern.  Also, I would have liked a storage bag for the third row of seats, which we removed.  They were easy to remove, however.<br><br>
