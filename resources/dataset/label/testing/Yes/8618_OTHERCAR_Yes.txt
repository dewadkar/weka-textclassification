            My wife and I had been looking semi-seriously for a 1 or 2-year-old minivan for about 6 months.  Our first choice was a Honda Odyssey, our second was the Toyota Sienna.  After surveying a few local Honda dealers we found they each deal only about one used Odyssey every <b>two years</b>, so we weren't holding on to our hopes for the Honda.

We know of a car dealer owned by a family acquaintance, so we asked him to look for us.  We found the vast majority of available used Honda Odysseys are coming from <i>Canada</i> nowadays, as it is extremely profitable for U.S. dealers to pay top dollar to Canadian dealers and still turn a good profit here in the states due to the extremely favorable exchange rate.  We ended up with a 2001 Odyssey with 15,000 miles.

<b>Be warned:</b> due to the fact that Honda is attempting to maximize profits, Honda VOIDS their 3-year/36,000-mile factory warranty if an Odyssey transfers ownership across the Canadian/U.S. border, or if a U.S. resident/citizen purchases one in Canada and drives it to the U.S.  Our dealer mistakenly told us the factory warranty transferred to us when we bought the van, and then later we found out it didn't.  Our dealer respectably gave us a pro-rata full warranty at their expense so we lucked out.

There is one benefit of getting a Canadian Honda though: running lights come as standard equipment.

<b>The positives:</b>
1. The rear fold-down seat is a great feature.  It folds down flush with the floor and gives you a lot of space.
2. The vehicle has LOTS of space, and room is configured very nicely inside.  The two middle captain seats are unbeatable, and the fold-down rear seat is a great feature.  The captain seats can be removed or reconfigured for different space requirements.
3. This vehicle drives more like a car than a van.  I normally prefer small cars because I like tight handling, and I must say the Odyssey has very tight and responsive steering for a vehicle this size.  The brakes regulate well, and are very nicely "grippy".  The power of the V6 is admirable.  The turning circle seems nicely tight.
4. Reliability, given Honda has worked out the kinks of the 1999 & 2000 models.
5. There is a child car-seat tether anchor under the captain seats, so no extra hardware is required as it is in some other vehicles.
6. I like the looks, even though in the past I've thought of Honda styling being "sterile".

<b>The negatives:</b>
{and I am EXTREMELY picky in this category!}
1. The shifter knob obstructs the view of the stereo controls.  It should be an inch or two shorter.
2. MPG: we're supposed to be getting 20/25MPG, we're making 16MPG mixed driving.
3. The Canadian warranty issue (see above).
4. Mechanical: the engine has a TIMING BELT.  Yes, a TIMING BELT that is supposed to be replaced every 60,000 miles!  Someone said in another review that the van will last them 300,000 miles, well good luck with the expense of having the timing belt replaced FIVE TIMES in that period.  This falls under the category of <b>what are you thinking of Honda!?</b>  A vehicle of this engineering stature should have a timing chain which wouldn't need replacement (like Nissans have used for <i>over 10 years</i>).
5. The price.

<b>Other:</b>
In other reviews, people are mentioning that 5W-20 oil is required (it is recommended).  You could use 5W-30 too, although it wouldn't be as efficient.  I've been getting 5W-20 for over a year now for my Maxima.  Pennzoil makes a 5W-20 that I've been able to find in Pep-Boys.

Do I recommend this vehicle?  Definitely.  Do I think the Toyota Sienna would have been a great choice as well?  Definitely, especially for the lower price.  <b>A hint to all:</b> if you don't care whether you have a fold-down back seat or not, buy the Toyota Sienna.  The Toyota is just as capable a vehicle at a lower price, and a much more available supply.
