            I love Ford vehicles so when my Dad bought his Ford, it made perfect sense for me to drive it.  I loved the feel of it on the road, the smooth drive and the room I had in it.  When at one time, he was involved in a wreck in which a little old lady pulled into him from another lane, it messed my Dad's front end up plus his left hand.  The rest of the truck was left without a scratch, but the front end was smashed in by the tire.  He was taken to the hospital for observing, but an officer was able to drive the truck into a parking area with no problem.  The truck was put into the Ford shop and my Dad was out of no pocket money.  The truck has still been trucking with no problem.  I would highly recommend this truck to anyone wanting a safe vehicle.<br><br>
