            I own a 4-Runner for 8 years.  I wanted to buy another one but they got so expensive that I started looking at other SUV's.  I concluded that no other SUV matches the price/performance punch of the Trooper.  I paid $21,000 + TTL in May of 2000 for a 1999 model.  I rented one in Alaska last year and loved it's on and off road capabilities.  So far I have had no complaint's.  I went on an 8 hour road trip last week and never felt that the seat's were uncomfortable.  It's much more roomier than the 4-Runner and is peppier.  It doesn't handle as well as the 4-Runner, I suspect because it's quite a bit bigger both in size and weight.  My only concern now is the Isuzu reliability vs. Toyota.  I've always felt Toyota/Lexus are the most reliable makes.  Only time will tell.<br><br>
