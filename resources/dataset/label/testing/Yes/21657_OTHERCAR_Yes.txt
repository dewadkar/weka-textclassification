             I bought my '97 Dodge SLT to replace a '96 Dakota that was just to small. I use the truck for work, and family trips. I have the 318 magnum V8 with automatic transmission version. It offers a great blend of power, performance, and fuel economy. 
 I pull a 5x8 enclosed tool trailer during the week, and have never had any trouble keeping up with traffic on the interstate highways that I travel. On weekends the extended cab offers plenty of room to carry my wife and kids out shopping or on trips to visit family.
 Fuel economy is pretty good for a full size truck. I get about 18 mpg on the highway empty and about 12 mpg/highway pulling my trailer. It may sound strange but for some reason this truck gets better gas mileage the faster it is driven. I have gotten as high as 20 mpg at 90 miles per hour.
 This truck is fun and comfortable to drive. Road noise is very minimal in the cab, it seems to have very good padding under the carpet on the floor and is well insulated elsewhere. I am 6'0&quot; tall and find that I have plenty of leg and head room even when wearing a hat. The 60/40 split seats are firm and offer good back and leg support in all the right places. The flip down center console is large and roomy, I am able to store several CD's, insurance papers, invoice books, pens, and a notepad in it. It is also quite comfortable as an arm rest. Driver control locations are well thought out. Buttons for the cruise control and horn are located on the steering wheel and are easy to reach and operate without taking your eyes off the road. It has the standard cigarette lighter in the ashtray, but also includes a 12 volt recepticle on the dash. The CD system sounds great. It has adjustments for fade, balance, treble, and bass so music can be tailored to your tastes. The back seat is fairly big and quite comfortable. It provides enough leg and head room for average adults to ride comfortably on short trips. My kids enjoy it on longer trips because they can have some toys along and still have room to sleep when they get tired. The keyless entry is one option I will insist on for any vehicle that I buy in the future, and the power windows have performed flawlessly.
 If you need the size and power of a full size truck, this one is worth looking at.<br><br>
