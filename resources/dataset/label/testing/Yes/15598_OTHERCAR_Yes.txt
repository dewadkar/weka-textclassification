            I personally don't own this product, it's a tad too pricy for me!  But I do have one at work that was purchased for me to use for our monthly newsletters.  I often bring this home with me to take pictures of the kids or other things I might be doing.  

The things you can do with this camera is amazing.  The thing I like most about it is the ablity to save your pictures directly to disk instead of a memory card that needs to be uploaded into the computer.  While out, if I use up more than one disk, I simply put another in.  With the digital camera I personally own, I would have to find a computer to upload and as we all know...if you don't have a lap top, it's not happening.

There is an option to use the viewfinder or the LCD display.  The LCD can be adjusted to help with light relections and can be turned up so that you can take a picture of yourself.   

Another feature I like is the ability to take 5 second movies. These are great to capture a smile or one of the kids saying good night that we can email to the grandparents.  When my husband was out of town on business, my son made him a goodnight &quot;movie&quot; everynight.

I highly recommend this camera to any one looking to buy a digital camera.  There are many out there that are cheaper, but none will do what this one can.<br><br>
