                  I love the Town Car for its level of comfort and size, but this car is not for everyone. Its styling (used) is reminiscent of late 80's/early 90's American luxo-cruisers and the handling is near non-existant. Here's some more comprehensive details about my experience with the 1990 Town Car:

Reliability: The Town Car is mechanically very reliable. Consumer reports has verified that fact for years. However, the interior of the Town Car has lots of chrome-covered plastic parts that are fading, and hard plastic on the armrests and on the dash in the form of defroster vents that warp in the heat. So, there are fittings that no longer fit together well that create eyesores. The only interior component that needed replacing, however, was the radio which stopped working.

Comfort: Lincoln made sure that the Town Car was comfy. The seats have plenty of padding. In fact, they have too much. If you spend too much time in the seats, your back and your bottom will ache. Otherwise, the ride is wonderful, and the noise level is pretty good. Wind noise is about all I hear when I'm driving the freeway.

Driving: Driving this Lincoln isn't the most exciting thing in the world. The over-use of power steering leaves the driver with no feel of the road, and the soft suspension makes for woozy turns. Emergency handling is pathetic. Also, the Town Car is huge so it's hard to park in tight spots. The rear pillar has a tendancy to create a pretty nasty blind spot, and the side view mirrors are microscopic. The V-8 engine only produces 150 hp, so expect poor acceleration (Even the modern-day 4 cylinders can get up to 150 hp). The gas mileage is pathetic. Expect about 15 mpg in the city and around 20 on the freeway.

Features: The Town Car comes with an abundance of features. The one I drove was the Signature series, and it had automatic climate control, power windows/doorlocks, power seats, lighted vanity mirrors, leather, an electric pull-down trunk, an elctromatic rear-view mirror, heated side mirrors, radio/tape player, and cruise control on the steering wheel. The sound system is decent for a 1990, but nothing compared to the new Lincolns.

This used Lincoln is a good value if you can find one with low miles. Large domestic luxury cars have a tendancy to lose their values fast, so you should be able to pick up a good deal. So, if you appreciate floaty rides, big padded seats, and gadgets galore, put this on your buy list.
