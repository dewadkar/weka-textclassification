            I previously owned a white Chevy S-10 pick up so when it came time to buy a new one, I researched small trucks and I was excited to see that the Chevy s_10 came out on top. I love driving this new truck because it is so smooth. It is so easy to clean and to detail. My gas mileage is in the top miles. It is a good looking truck.  The third door makes loading and unloading so very easy. It is very easy to get add-ons and kits at very reasonable prices.  My truck is now 2 years old and it is still in excellent condition.  It is used for hauling and transporting the children to many events. I have not had any mechanical issues or problems at all. I purchased my truck out of town, but the local dealers take care of you just as if you purchased the vehicle from them. <br><br>
