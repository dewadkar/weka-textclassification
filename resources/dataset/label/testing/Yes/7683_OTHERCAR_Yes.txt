            I don't know why I never looked at Volvos seriously before. Maybe it was their perpetually ugly designs which always managed to look like rolling boxes. Or maybe it was the image I had in my mind that a Volvo customer was always a well-off suburban mom who bore an uncanny resemblance to Hillary Clinton and who had a liberal arts degree in literature from Boston College. Definitely <i>not</i> the kind of car that a ramblin' kinda guy would drive...

My attitude changed this week. On the recommendations of one of my office colleagues who just bought a new S80, I took an afternoon off to test drive a Volvo. 

<b>Design</b>
It seems funny to use the words "design" and "Volvo" in the same sentence. Everybody knows that while Volvo has always hired good engineers for their underlying structures, they've always hired their designers away from Sven's Box and Crate Company. I'm not saying their cars were always <i>ugly</i> but....hmm...wait a sec...yes, as a matter of fact, Volvos <i>were</i> always ugly. I've heard that they did once, back in the 1950s or 60s, design one sporty little car that was almost attractive -- but then they quickly realized the error of their ways and promptly fired that designer and sent their head hunter back to Sven's. The new guy churned out boxes throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Things are a little different with the 2001 model year Volvos. The lines are a bit rounded. Stand at the back of the car and sight down the door line from the back bumper to the front and you'll see how the car sort of bulges a bit in the middle and slopes down the front and rear hoods -- that ain't no straight line, Bunky!  The bumpers actually look curved, not like the designers cut up I-beams from a construction site. Stand at the side of the S60 and take a step back. Notice the smooth curved lines of the passenger compartment. Sure it's not as arc-shaped as the Beetle in those Volkswagen commercials, but the lines are startlingly shifted closer to those used in BMWs or Mercedes.

If you haven't actually seen these cars, you might not believe me, but I'd actually go out on a limb and say that the new Volvos are downright <i>attractive</i> and even -- gasp! -- <i>sporty</i> looking vehicles!

<b>Features and Such...</b>
The car I drove was pretty well equipped at just under $32,000. It had leather interior, power seats with 3 memory settings, automatic transmission with a manual function, dual temperature controls, sunroof, anti-lock brakes, power steering with tilt and telescopic wheel, and six-speaker Dolby pro-logic stereo with AM/FM, cassette, and CD player.

Volvo offers three engines with the S60: a basic 2.4 litre 5 cylinder with 168 horsepower, a turbocharged 2.4 with 197 horsepower, or a supercharged 2.3 litre that kicks out a whopping 247 horsepower. The car I drove had the 2.4T engine (mid range of the three). It also had Volvo's Geartronic automatic transmission with "auto-stick" feature. If you're not familiar with this transmission, it is essentially an automatic that can be shifted like a manual, if you're a driver who prefers the feel of a real stick shift. Similar transmissions are available from BMW, Mercedes, and Acura, so it's not a unique feature.

In keeping with Volvo's reputation as a leader in automotive safety, the S60 includes a lot of safety features that you don't find on most cars. The seats have a built-in whiplash protection feature where in the event of a crash the seats move to lessen sudden neck and head movements that cause whiplash. The passenger compartment is built around the idea of an enclosed steel cage, and there are not only airbags, but side airbags and and an airbag "curtain" that descends down to cover all glass surfaces, preventing not only passengers from being ejected or having their heads come in contact with the glass, but also preventing outside objects from coming into the passenger compartment. The salesman explained a lot of other minor safety features, like outside lighting, but the structure and the airbag system were the points that seemed to best illustrate the company's commitment to driver safety.

The car has a lot of other features that show intelligent design and engineering and dedication to the customer -- things like the air filters, or the radiator that removes ozone from the air. Not things that make me jump up and down, but things that make me think "why doesn't everybody do this?"

<b>A Real Driver's Car</b>
The Volvo S60 really is a <i>fun</i> car to drive. The 197 horsepower turbocharged 2.4 litre 5 cylinder was extremely responsive, and while I doubt I'd ever win a street race with it, it was more ample to get the car up to a 70 mph highway speed before getting run down by that 18-wheeler in my rearview mirror. 

After pulling the car off the freeway and onto a backroad, the salesman who was with me suggested I try slamming on the brakes to simulate a panic-brake situation. I did, fully expecting to hear tires screech. Nope! The car braked very quickly, but the wheels never locked up. 

I tried a couple hard turns to see how tight the turning radius, and I figure it was about a lane and a half. Not bad. 

Any vehicle should feel good when its new, and this one definitely did. Very quiet, and very precise feeling. 

<b>Comfort</b>
The S60 is definitely a comfortable vehicle. More spacious inside than many cars of its class. The instrument panel is spread out with visible gauges and accessible knobs. My one nit is the way so many of the knobs and surfaces look and feel like rather cheesy plastic. I also wish the temperature knobs for the dual climate control included both fahrenheit <I>and</I> celsius. 

I liked the adjustment mechanisms on the front seats with the three-way memory settings, and I like the clean lines of the dashboard. The seats were comfortable, with adjustable lumbar support, and the salesman said they were available with heaters too. Yeah, right, like there's ever been a day here in Texas where somebody would <i>need</i> heated seats...

The back seats seemed a little tight on space, especially when the front seat was back, but the seats have a sort of scooped out design that gives a little extra skoosh of leg room there. You can also fold down part of the back seat to pass through long objects from the trunk into the passenger compartment. 

<b>Stacking the S60 Up Against the Competition</b>
The S60 is frankly, on the low end of the price scale for vehicles that I'm comparing it against. Other vehicles that I've recently test driven include the 2002 Mercedes Benz C240 and a 2002 BMW 330. These vehicles are all different and appeal to slightly different market segments, but they are all european 4-door sedans with roughly comparable performance specs and equipment. I will probably also compare the Acura 3.2TL and maybe one of the Lexus models, but I haven't gotten around to test driving those vehicles yet.

Compared to the Mercedes Benz C240, I feel that the Mercedes is quieter and has a more sophisticated and elegant interior and it has an OnStar-like system standard, but otherwise the Volvo is more powerful by about 30 horsepower, seems to have a roomier interior and trunk, better safety engineering, and better features for the money (for example, a CD player is a $645 option on the Mercedes, but standard on the Volvo). For overall value, the Volvo looks like the better deal.

BMW has always been among my favorite cars in terms of engineering, and after driving both the 330 and the Volvo S60, I prefer the handling and feel of the BMW and I like its instrument cluster better than I like the flatter feeling dashboard of the Volvo. But the Volvo feels roomier and peppier (at least with the 2.4T engine -- I did not test the more powerful optional T5 engine with its 247 horses). 

I'm still in the midst of evaluating cars, so I've got a lot more research to do, but so far, the Volvo S60 is shaping up as the intelligent buy among european sedans in the $30-40K price range. I don't know if I'll buy it or not yet...but it sure surprised me that I liked the vehicle as much I did.
