            After having a love-hate relationship with my Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T (review at <a href="/content_75663838852">http://www.epinions.com/content_75663838852</a>) I decided that it was time to get a car that had good build quality. However, I wasn&#146t willing to give up the performance aspects of the 1.8T engine. This proved to be a dilemma. Where could I find a reasonably priced car that would be as quick and nimble as the Jetta yet not fall apart when I touch it?

Then, one day, while doing research on the web, I came across a $2,000 rebate offer from Mazda for the MazdaSpeed Prot�g� 2003 and 2003.5. Now, my very first car was a Mazda Prot�g� and I knew I liked the car, so I figured, why not? I&#146ll take it for a test drive. Two minutes into the drive I knew I had to have the car.

MazdaSpeed is an aftermarket tuner for Mazda. I&#146ve heard of them before through their sponsorship of SCCA racing (I believe this year the lovely Marinus was behind the wheel of the Tri-Point Motorsports Mazda Prot�g� ES &#150 Rowr!). The MazdaSpeed Prot�g� is the result of excellent racing experience as well as engineer&#146s wish list for what they want in a car. As a limited edition car (only 2750 were brought to the US), it comes fully loaded with everything you might need. There isn&#146t one option available. Not that you would need one. Since this is the first street legal car that MazdaSpeed has build for production since before I was born, they obviously spent a lot of time building a dream package that should more than satisfy any driver. 

Let&#146s start off with the basics: 2.0 liter, 170 hp Garrett turbocharged engine, air-to-air intercooler, 5-speed manual transmission (sorry, no automatic), limited slip differential, stabilizer bar, Tokico dampers, 4 wheel disk ABS, &#147MazdaSpeed&#148 badging and body kit, Racing Hart 17&#148 wheels (extremely lightweight) turning 215/45ZR Bridgestone Potenzas, Mazdaspeed Shift knob and aluminum pedals, and a 450 watt 7-speaker Kenwood CD/MP3 system. Woah. And, with the rebate, it brought the total cost of the car to around 17 grand. To put that into perspective that&#146s in the same neighborhood as a Civic EX.

The interior, although cramped, is very tastefully done. The dashboard and steering wheel have small hints of carbon fiber trim flanked by silver. The doors have a faux-suede that reminds me a lot of the Lexus IS300 interior. The seats are comfortable and provide many adjustments for the driver. Ergonomics are great: all controls are where you would expect them to be. Even the shortened shift knob doesn't feel out of place. The controls on the stereo are a bit small, however, so making adjustments to settings will require you to take your eyes off the road. This task is best left for stoplights or traffic. This is not a car you would haul around 3 year olds in &#150 or even 4 adults. I suggest yourself and one other person who is crazy and brave enough to hang on and shut up!

The ride is just passable as a daily driver. Because you&#146re riding on a heavily modified suspension and low profile tires, you will feel the bumps. There&#146s no way around that. Engine noise is acceptable but not great. The exhaust has a pretty deep, throaty tone that inspires the driver to push the limits of the car. And when you do, you will get a nice turbo whine that, if you&#146re into that sort of thing, will make the hairs on the back of your neck rise. If you&#146re looking for a pristine drive, or even a drive that&#146s comparable to the stock Prot�g�, you should look elsewhere. 

This car has &#147race car&#148 written all over it, so if you don&#146t fall into the target demographic then you should move on to a Toyota Prius review. But if you have the itch for speed but not a lot of cash then you should definitely take a look at this car. To drive it is to love it. I&#146ve taken the car on 90 degree turns at 55/60 mph and I didn&#146t hear a squeal (I did hear the blow-off valve though&#133 man that&#146s such a sweet sound). The best thing is that the stabilizer bar eliminates almost all body roll and the strut tie brace makes the turn in almost instant. It's as if the car is an agile tiger ready to pounce wherever you point it to. 

Yet the gas mileage is holding at a steady 24 MPG. Go figure. I've been driving the car pretty aggressively the past few months and every time I fill up I'm right around 23.9 and 24.2. Since the car is a forced induction vehicle you will need to fill up with premium fuel. California gas stations limit me to 91 octane which, right now, costs about $1.90 / gallon. Apparently, fun doesn't come cheaply.

If I had one gripe about the car it would be the torque steer and bump steer. Since these tires are directional you'll sometimes get a bit of drift to one side or another -- especially if you're driving on the "wonderful" Southern California freeway system. My commute is about an hour and a half every day and so far I haven't had a problem with it, but others may not have as much patience. If you punch the gas in a hurry you'll have to wrestle with the steering wheel a bit to get yourself going straight. But, then again, you'll be hard pressed to find another high torque front wheel drive car that doesn't suffer from the same issue, so it's something I'm willing to live with.

I have two problems so far with the car: the stereo and the turbo. Apparently these are known issues which I hope they're busy developing a fix for. First off, the stereo. Don't get me wrong, I love the head unit and it has plenty of power, but it may have a bit too much power. After one month of use I've already blown out the subwoofer. Since I have 250W pointing directly at a free-air subwoofer, I was able to burn out the coil and possibly tear the paper. I'm in the process of getting a replacement sub but I'll have to wait since they're backordered. Apparently, I'm behind 4 other people in the queue at my local dealership. You would think that in a limited production car such as this they would have tested to see whether the system was capable of blowing the subwoofer, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm planning on getting another subwoofer -- this time in an enclosure -- to alleviate the problem.

Secondly, the turbo, at high revs, causes the entire car to jerk violently. Usually, in second gear, at about 5500 RPM, the engine starts to hesitate as if it wasn't getting enough fuel. A simple fix in the fuel/air mixture should solve this problem. I talked to the service technician at my local Mazda dealership and he told me that there was a flash upgrade available to the ECU, but he hasn't noticed any change in the engine's performance. I'm hoping this is something that can be worked out as well because it's very annoying to have engine jerks (and thus sudden weight redistribution) while taking turns at high engine revs. 

Problems aside, I really enjoy driving this car. To borrow from an old slogan, "It Just Feels Right". This car is no WRX STi or EVO though. It would be a spirited race around the twisties but the MazdaSpeed Prot�g� would eat dust on the straight-aways. That's OK, though; with the extra cash I saved I can go buy a good lunch at the track.
