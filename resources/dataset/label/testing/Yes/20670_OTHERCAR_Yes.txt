            The main reason I bought this truck was the price. I got it used off a repo lot (it only had 28000 miles on it). I wound up with the Cheyenne package with a 5 speed. As far as a work truck goes this one will definitely get the job done. The engine has way more torque than it really needs (I got the 6.5 turbo diesel). I do not recommend the 4.10 rear end unless the truck will be LOADED its whole life. The 4.10 rear end is really overkill with the power this engine puts out. This truck has pulled everything I have put behind it or dug a hole trying. I did have quite a bit of trouble out of the electronic injection pump (I prefer the mechanical pumps on the old 6.2s). But Chevy stuck to their 100k mile warranty and replaced the pump three times and finally got it right. It seems the computers on the early models (mine is a '95) were a bit buggy. right now I have nearly 92k on it and it shows no sign of giving up. With the 4.10 rear end, manual shift and super stiff rear springs, it is a beast to keep rear tires on it. Running around empty like I do most of the time lets the rear tires slip too much and wear the tires out pretty quickly. But the cab is still tight even though I live on rough dirt road (with an even rougher 1/2 mile driveway).
Parts are pretty high since it is a heavy duty p/u with a diesel motor. But keep the filters changed and I believe it will definitely wear out the body on the p/u.
This truck is almost like driving gas burner with all the low end torque it has and the extra punch when the turbo spools up. And with the stiff 3/4 ton suspension, it actually handles pretty good too. Fuel economy is still decent even with the 4.10 gears (I get 14mpg on the low side and 19 on the high end). The lower rear end has the motor turning 2500rpm at 75mph and I think that is a little high (for longevity not just mpg). If I had my druthers I would have an automatic with about a 3.55 rear end. 
Pasture performance is only fair. The stiff springs make for a jouncy ride on all but the smoothest hay meadows and with all the weight on the front end (the thing is like throwing a hammer) if you get into a wet spot you are likely to be there till you get pulled out. The front end sinks in soft ground and the torquey engine just starts turning the rear wheels over. So I guess the only options I really wish I had on this truck would be 4x4, automatic trans., and higher gears for highway travel.
But for solid transportation and plenty of work muscle, you cannot beat it. <br><br>
