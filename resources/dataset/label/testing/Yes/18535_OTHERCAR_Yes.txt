            I recently test drove the CTS because I was skeptical of whether or not this really was the BMW-fighting Cadillac GM tells us it is.  After my initial test drive, I'd say there is no question in my mind that it is.  Buyers also seem to think so.  This fine auto is flying off of dealer lots and showrooms faster than Cadillac can build them.  That is why GM is considering adding another shift to the CTS's state-of-the-art Lansing Grand River plant.  Here are my initial impressions:

*Very well put together
*Clean styling
*Distinct
*Body panels fit well
*Hood and trunk lids fit well
*New Cadillac emblem looks great on this car

The car I test drove was Sterling metallic with a Light Neutral interior.  It had an automatic transmission.  As I got inside the interior, I was looking for something to complain about.  Fortunately for Cadillac, there were only minor gripes.  Here are some of them:

*No storage in rear armrest
*Rear seat Pass-Thru uses ugly trunk lining
*Trunk lining ugly
*A little too much plastic
*Rear headroom a little skimpy

But there were a lot of praises for the interior:

*Clean styling
*High-grade plastics
*Comfortable
*Rear seatbacks accommodate rear A/C vents
*Legroom plentiful
*Ergonomics are superb
*Rear armrest contains built-in cupholders

Here are my driving impressions (1-10):

09--Acceleration
10--Turning radius
09--Brakes
10--Pedal feel
09--Handling
09--Ride
10--Road grip
10--Fun-to-drive factor

Notes:  The automatic transmission was very smooth; CTS-R model soon to be available, it contains a higher-horsepower engine, not that the current V-6 is slow (0-60mph in 6.9 seconds).
