            This is a new age in photography, we can take pictures and review them right on the spot, then we can take those pictures and send them across the world in an instant. Digital technology has brought us these abilities, and the Olympus D-340 R takes these new opportunities and turn's them into reality with amazing clarity and ease of use.
The 340 takes an excellent picture, very comparable to conventional camera's, however, so do tons of other camera's on the market. So what sets this camera apart? Here's what I've found with my experiences.

1. Ease of use: This camera is very self-explaining. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to operate, and still gives some powerful advanced options for the more experienced.

2. Built in flash and excellent LCD display: I have had other Digital camera's in the past, and this surpasses them by far with the LCD display. There is no &quot;choppiness&quot; or blurry pictures with this display. This makes taking pictures of moving objects much easier. A flash is an absolute necessity for a camera, and this has a very nice built in flash with multiple options for easy &quot;night-time&quot; picture taking.

3. Ease of connecting to computer: I personally didn't have any problems with connecting my camera to the computer. It worked seamlessly and without event. Which is always good with these kind of electronics.

4. IT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL CAMERA: This maybe not that important to some people, but it is a huge advantage for me. The small size and portability of the 340 us excellent for a digi-cam. Lugging around a bulky camera just doesn't sound appealing to me. Plus the fact crooks wont be as able to tell the difference between your camera, and a less-expensive &quot;conventional&quot; camera.<br><br>
