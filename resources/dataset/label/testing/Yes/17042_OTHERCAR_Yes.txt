            OKAY OKAY!  Let me get this out there.  I purchased my 98 Dodge Durango on Valentine's day for my wife. It has every option available. She absolutely loves this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone.  Myself on the other hand: Overall this vehicle is the best sport utility on the market.  I'm happy with it's style, power and seating.  What I'm not happy about is it's ride.  They kept promoting this vehicle as smooth ride.  I disagree.  I have a hard time swallowing the $32,000 sticker price for something that rides like my son's Radio Flyer wagon. Our Durango is Amethyst Pearl. Pretty yes, but it scratches way to easily.  I would stay away from dark colors on all Dodges. SO, If ride doesn't matter to you and your shopping for a sport utility, Durango is the one.  It handles nicely and seating/storage option seem limitless. Towing is great. I guess i don't &quot;HATE&quot; this vehicle.  I just think for the price it could ride much nicer.
