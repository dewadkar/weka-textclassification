            I have had this digital camera for about a week now, and I must say, I am quite impressed so far. The camera has met or exceeded all expectations I had for it. The 5 megapixel images are stunning, as far as clarity, color, brightness and realistic photographic imagery go. I like the capability to switch to different modes also (5M, 4.5M, 3.1M, 1.2M, 640x480), so I can shoot in 3:2 mode (which is about 4.5 megapixels). This mode seems best if you're planning on printing out 4x6 photos. Also, the camera is easy to use, and the settings and features are easy to find/change. I pretty much can just point and shoot with everything in auto mode, but I do like the ability to tinker with the program settings and change things around, for different types of shots. I have had excellent results with both outdoor and indoor shots, which is a major improvement over the last digital camera I had. I don't really have any use for the movie mode, as it takes up too much space on my 128MB x 2 memory stick, but it is a neat little feature to have available. I find the voice recording feature useful, for basically explaining each shot, which I later write into the properties of the picture that I save to my hard drive. I also like the ability to hook the camera up to the TV, and run it in slideshow mode. My family gets a kick out of seeing themselves on TV... Overall, I think this is an excellent point and shoot digital camera. To get such a high quality 5MP camera for 350 dollars is amazing to me. I love this camera, and my family does to. I highly recommend it.
