               I am currently halfway into a 3-year lease of a Chevy S-10 pickup. I am very pleased with the vehicle and would even consider buying one. It is a very dependable and fun truck. The only negative about my S-10 is its small size. It can be hard to handle on slick or icy roads. This can of course be taken care of by adding weight to the bed of the truck, but that only works if you actually take the time and energy to actually find the weight and load it up. Which is something I haven't done yet. It gets very good gas mileage and is very dependable. The price is very reasonable. An S-10 is a very good buy for anyone who likes the idea of a truck, but can't afford to buy one of the big ones. <br><br>
