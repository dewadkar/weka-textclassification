            Back in 1995, I had just graduated from college, and was saddled with a 10-year-old car worth about $250 and a Whopper on the open market.  I toyed with the idea of buying the most inexpensive new car I could, to try to avoid the cost of repairs.  One day, my girlfriend (now wife) and I test drove the Ford Aspire...which has since EXpired, and the Geo Metro, which soldiers on today as the Chevrolet Metro, virtually unchanged over the past five years.

We tested the 4-door sedan, with the optional 79-horsepower 4-cylinder motor and optional 13&quot; wheels. The standard engine on the bare-bones hatchback, remember, is a 55-horsepower THREE-cylinder.  These entry-level cars aren't made for speed, but this is dipping down near lawn-tractor numbers.

Anyway, upon entry it becomes clear that the Metro sedan actually has enough room to be comfortable inside, at least for front-seat occupants.  The seats are firm and flat, as are most in the near-$10k price category, but are at least shaped to accept the human anatomy relatively well.  Legroom is abundant, and the dashboard is designed to maximize the feeling of space, rather than intrude into the passenger's space and make them feel claustrophobic.  Also, the tall, narrow body design offers a large greenhouse area, making visibility excellent and letting a lot of outside light into the cabin.

Of course, the abundance of legroom has to come from somewhere, and I started to wonder:  If my legs can go so far under the dash, and the hood is only a couple of feet long...<i>where's the engine?</i>  Well, open the hood and you'll see.  It's just a tiny engine -- 1.3 liters doesn't make for a very large engine block, so only about half of the underhood space is taken up by the drivetrain, the rest is behind the firewall.

Driving the Metro is sort of like playing with a pencil and three Pink Pearl erasers.  The pencil is the shifter, and the erasers are the pedals.  Anyone with large feet is going to have a few problems only pressing one pedal at a time, as the erasers -- er, pedals -- are close together, as well.  The clutch is very light, and easy to modulate, however, and the transmission changes gears easily.  Even reverse was easy to engage, and didn't pop out of gear as the Aspire did.

Actually, we tested the Metro with an ulterior motive, that day.  My girlfriend had never driven a stick shift before, you see, and my clunker had one.  It's sneaky, but I thought that if she was going to tear apart a clutch it'd be better if it weren't mine.  Happily, everything went well.  Very well, in fact -- the Metro is an excellent car for the manual-shift novice.  The clutch is very light and has a wide engagement band, which translates into being very forgiving of an inexperienced or shaky left foot.  After 20 minutes, she was starting on uphill grades like an old hand, and enjoying herself mightily.

On the open road, the Metro easily ran at 60 miles per hour, and felt stable at that speed.  It tracked straight and was undisturbed by expansion joints, though it was buffeted a bit by passing semitrucks.  A concession has to be made to the fact that the Metro only weighs 1,984 lbs, though -- it's a real lightweight, as cars go.  The next car up Chevy's food chain, the Cavalier, weighs 2,617 lbs. -- 700 lbs. more.  The light weight of the Metro has given it the distinction of being the first car ever to be blown off the Mackinac Bridge, in the late 1980's.

The Metro is a new car in its most basic form.  It has a motor, a seat, wheels and a roof, and it pulls in 43 miles per gallon on the highway. (only 34mpg with the automatic)  It doesn't require its occupants to contort themselves into pretzels to drive it, and it doesn't convey the feeling that it's going to leave the roadway under its own volition...unless you're on a 300' tall suspension bridge during a windstorm.  It's easy to drive, it's easy to afford at a $10,610 sticker price for the sedan, ($9,185 for the hatchback) and easy to fill up every other month or so.  

There is a lot of competition to consider in the entry-level market, including the newly restyled Hyundai Accent, the Daewoo Lanos, Dodge Neon, Saturn SL, sister-car Suzuki Swift and Kia Sephia. Many of these competitors offer a higher level of standard features than the Metro.  In the end, though, any purchase comes down to personal preference, and if what you want is basic transportation, or a way out of the used-car repair trap, the Metro just may be your ticket.<br><br>
