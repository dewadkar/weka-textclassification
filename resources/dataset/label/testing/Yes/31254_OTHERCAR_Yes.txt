            When we went car shopping 3 years ago, we never knew we would find such a great car!! We purchased a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am SE. We bought it in 1997, so it was slightly over 2 years old. We've never had any trouble with this car, other than maintenance upkeep. We have 3 children, and it's somewhat of a snug fit, but, we also have 2 kids still in carseats. My older son sits in the middle. 

Ours is a 3.1 litre, 6 cylinder engine. It has great pick-up, and does pretty well on gas. It tends to get more MPG if we put high test gas in, but still does ok with the lower grade.

There's not much that I don't like about my car. The things that I can think of are, the price for a tire for it are a little high. They are high performance tires, so they run about $125 a piece. (Not that I'm a high performance driver!!) But that is what came on ours.The other thing is in the front seat, on the passenger side, the leg room is limited due to the design of center panel. Other than that, I love everything about this car. Its nice to drive, it handles very well in the snow, and I love the anti-lock brakes.

This car is good for a family up to five, but would be ideal for a smaller family. We need to trade to something bigger, but how do you go from a Grand Am to a mini van?? ugh:O)<br><br>
