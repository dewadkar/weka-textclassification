            I was in need of a digital camera for a car show that was on the same day. I needed to have something convenient, portable and somewhat inexpensive. I found the total package when i got this sony mavica FD-73. This camera suited all my photography needs. It has many great 
Features:
1- Index of pictures to see multiple pictures at a time
2- Black and white photographs
3- Sephia photos4
4- Negative photos
5- Ease of use through a 1.44 Mb Floppy Diskette
6- NO upload link to computer
7- Timing function for delayed photographs
8- Different settings for the flash to accomodate surroundings.

Overall this camera is well worth the money, with a 1.5 megapixel picture quality the pictures at a size of 640 x 480 turn out to be pretty clear. I had a few problems with the focusing initially when i first bought the camera. Though after time the focus seemed to be on my side. For high definition quality pictures this may not be the exact camera to get, though for reasonable quality photographs and extreme ease of use. This is the definite camera to get. Also a suggestion would be using those old AOL diskettes you use to receive for free, deleting everything on them and using them diskettes for the camera. This will save you the trouble of having to purchase new diskettes.<br><br>
