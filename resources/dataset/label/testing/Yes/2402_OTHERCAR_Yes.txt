            First, let me say, through some smart shopping, I bought this for $300 at Egghead Auctions. Regular retail is like $700, so I got a huge discount!

The first day I received this camera, I had to go out and play with it. The rechargeable battery seemed to last forever! I took pictures at each of the SIX photo quality settings and I also recorded a one minute "mini-movie" using the full motion MPEG feature.

Then I came back inside to test all of the features. I first had to choose between the serial and USB connections. Because I have a slew of USB perhipherals already (keyboard, ZIP, printer), I chose the serial connection. This serial connection is supposed to be slower than USB, but I have not noticed a significant speed issue. The connection on this camera is much faster than on the Olympus I had before.

The software is incredible. A small program runs in your system tray (if you choose) and shows a "slide show" like preview of all images and movies. You can then double-click any image to look at it in full scale of choose to save it to disk, edit it, etc.

Overall this was a great deal and is a great camera. The one downside is the choice of pixel settings (6 in all). It can get a bit confusing, especially in quick reaction environments like live sports, etc. You always need to make sure you are prepared with the correct setting before snapping that sports shot or you could regret it!
