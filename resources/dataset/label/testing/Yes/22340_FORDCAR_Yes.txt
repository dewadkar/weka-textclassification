            After my son was born my husband and I were on the search for something to replace my 2-door sports car.  Unfortunately we spent six months driving a small SUV before we wised up and traded it in on our Expedition.

There isn't a bad seat in the house.  The driver's seat is comfortable with electronic adjustments and a lumbar support.  Even on long trips the seats are still nice. Three adults sit comfortably in the middle seat and the third is perfect for two adults or three kids.  A nice perk is the "stadium seating" as the seats go farther back they are higher, this way people in the third row have more to look at that the back's of peoples' heads.

When my son was facing backwards in his car-seat it would take a long time for the a/c to circulate enough to cool him off.  This was one of the main reasons we wanted two air conditioning units.  The rear unit can be worked from the front or the back seat and it doesn't take long to cool the entire truck.  There are air vents for every seat.

This truck is so roomy!  I had no idea how much "stuff" we were going to have to pack with us everywhere we went until my son was born.  We can go on a vacation with suitcases, the stroller, ice chests and the playpen and it all fits perfect.  However, if the third seat was folded down you wouldn't have near as much room.

Most of the negatives that I read referred to the gas mileage.  Now my Expedition gets no where near what my Integra got, but look at the size (and safety)difference.  I usually get around 17 mpg, I don't think that's too bad considering it's size and two air conditioners.  The V8 engine has lots of get up and go.  You can pass people easily on the highway and you never have to worry about waiting for a long break in traffic before you pull out.  The Expedition will get you there - and in a hurry!  

There are a lot of nice perks that come with this vehicle.  *One is cup holders galore, the whole family can bring  
  their drinks.  
*The console is huge, there is room for a ton of stuff.  *The doors all have storage plus there is storage in the  
  rear cargo area.  
*There is also a luggage rack, I've never used it since 
  there is so much room inside.  
*The running boards make it easy to get in and out of, 
  especially for kids.  
*The instrument panel is easy to read and everything is 
  easy to reach and operate.
*It's easy to park, more like a car than a truck.

We have had our Expedition one year and I can honestly say that I do not have one negative thing to say about it.  Our parents and grandparents each bought one too and they all love it. It's the perfect vehicle for our family!
