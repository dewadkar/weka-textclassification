            I needed a van capable of towing a 4000 lb boat, and my wife needs dry cargo capacity for her business, and kid hauling ability.  The Safari/Astro are about the only options.  We bought the van and immediately headed to Disneyland, 1500 miles distant on I-5. It's a SLE that's nicely equipped along with well executed factory running boards, and the touring package (R6N) which includes 3.73 gears, locking differential, towing package, dutch doors, and rear-seat heater.  

Having the two bench seats gave my 2 kids lots of space, making the trip much more harmonious than a car.  I took it easy for the first 400 miles, but found I had to travel at about 75 mph to keep from being run over once I hit the returning Thanksgiving holiday traffic south of Sacramento.  Fuel economy at this speed averaged about 18 MPG.  It also took time to get used to the wheel well hump, which really reduces room for your feet.  

Once there, I did an early oil change (1600 mi.) at a local Jiffy Lube.  They did a pretty thorough inspection, and found my coolant reservoir tank was nearly empty, and the ball joints were dry.  The manager also indicated that in his experience, nearly all GM products come to him low on &quot;something&quot;.  In defence of my dealer, the vehicle was brought over from Vancouver the day I took possession, and did not have a chance to inspect the Vancouver dealers PDI.  Make sure your dealer does this inspection - you ARE paying for it after all...

On the way home, we ran into very thick fog through Oregon and Washington, but the high seating position really helped in finding my way.  We pulled a 26 hr all-nighter coming home, and the ability for the kids and co-driver to sleep (belted in) underway was really nice!  Economy at 55 - 60 MPH showed 24 MPG - not bad of a 4300 lb brick! The ability to re-configure the seats gives this van great versatility for cargo or people hauling.

Nitpicks:  There's no separate control for recirculating cabin air, so your stuck sniffing that diesel in a traffic jam.  The A/C runs with the control set to bi-level, impairing economy when you only want heat, and the A/C doesn't run on defrost.  A/C dries the air and really speeds up defrosting.  I wish GM would have put in a separate A/C switch so you could control when you wanted the compressor to run.  The new models have a chrome trim ring on the steel wheels which look nice but make it impossible to easily access the valve stems without adding valve stem extensions.  Make you dealer fork out the extra $3.00 for these. BTW _ don't rely on the &quot;range&quot; readout on the trip computer - go by &quot;fuel used&quot; I came within 1 gallon of running dry by trusting the thing.

Dealer experience:  So far so good.  There's a color mismatch in the hood and the RH mirror had a scrape (delivery damage missed by the first dealership).  On rough roads, there was a annoying buzz from the antilock brake module under the drivers seat (caused by a spring-wrapped brake line coming in contact with the protective shroud)  They quickly scheduled a time to repair the mirror and buzz, and repaint the hood without any hassle.

My last vehicle was a 89 Toyota X-cab truck that was reliable as a brick.  If this van is anywhere near as good, I'll be happy, and probably a bit surprised.  I talked to a lot of people with these vans before buying, and all of them had good things to say.  Even the Jiffy Lube manager indicated his brother-in-law had a '92 with over 250,000 miles on it - and it was still running strong.  Time will tell... <br><br>
