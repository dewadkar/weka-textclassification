            I own a 98 Cherokee sport. I bought it new in late 97. I work for Hertz rent a car so I have a chance to test drive many cars and SUV's. It's part of my job to fit people with the right car/SUV. I had narrowed my choices to the Cherokee or an Explorer sport. 

I had a discount with any Ford car but even with that the cost of both was about the same. I chose the Jeep because of it's on road/off road performance and overall feel was more solid than the Ford. It handles better and is faster than most SUV's in it's class. It also gets slightly better gas mileage. All due to it lighter weight. It has enough room, front and back for 4 adults to sit fairly comfortably but it is not as roomy as Explorer 4 door or some other SUV's. It is not the most quiet but it is not significantly louder either, you don't have to yell to be heard by anyone in the car.

 The biggest downside is it's old design which is why it is priced so low. I think it may add to it's appeal. After over 2 years and 37,000 miles I am satisfied in my choice I can drive my SUV like a sports car, carry lot's of stuff, and still go off road at the drop of a hat and not get stuck in mud or snow. That's not something that any SUV can claim, despite the commercials. I have written reviews on the '95-98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 95-00 Explorer 4 dr 4x4 ,Explorer Sport,'99-00 Isuzu Rodeo. All these cars either are or were in the Hertz rental fleet I drove them all on a daily basis and put them into the shop when needed. Unfortunately the Grand Cherokee and Explorers were in the shop more often than the imports. They all have abilities that stand out more than others. The Explorer has the most room. The Grand Cherokee strongest engines and best balance between comfort,style,and off/on performance. The Izusu is very stylish but did not stand out in any other way. The Subaru is a car with the benefit of 4 wheel drive and great dependability.            <br><br>
