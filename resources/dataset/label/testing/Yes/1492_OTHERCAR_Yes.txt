            My parents leased a Saturn SL2 in 1996 for me as Christmas gift.  At the time, I didn't know much about Saturns, but I really liked the look of it.  I was 19 at the time and it was such a great car to drive 2 hours back and forth to college.  When I got the car I was actually a little nervous because it was a stick shift and I'd never driven a stick before.  I have to say that this was the best car I could have ever learned on.  The standard is such a smooth ride and the clutch is great.  
People think of Saturn's as being small and cheap, but the SL2 was very roomy and could fit plenty of my luggage and other junk in the back seat and the trunk.  After I graduated from college and got married, my husband and I started building a house.  At the time we had no truck, so the SL2 kind of became a truck for us.  We used it to haul landscaping, paint and other house supplies.  It held up extremely well for the conditions it was exposed to.
I also felt very safe in the Saturn.  I got in to one accident while I owned the SL2 and only had hood damage done.  Once it was fixed, you'd never have known I was in an accident.  This would be a great car for any teen or even a family because you'll not only feel safe, but you'll actually be safe.
The SL2 that I had was great for teens because it had a great stereo with an upgraded equalizer and a rear spoiler for that sporty look.  It didn't have any other options besides air, but no power windows or door locks.  Some parents feel those are unnecessary needs for teens.  But, if you did want to add these options, they are definitely available.  
I think my favorite thing about the Saturn SL2 was the gas mileage, which was unbelievable in this car!  I could go at least 2 weeks if not more, before getting gas.  It was amazing, and with gas prices the way they are today, it's even better.
If the Saturn SL2 doesn't appeal to you, I still recommend checking out the other Saturn models because it really is a great car company.  I never had any problems in the 4 years that I had the car and the sales and service folks were great.  They also have &quot;Saturn Nights&quot; every once in a while and anyone who's recently purchase a Saturn whether new or used can attend.  Basically, they have pizza and take you on a tour of the service area and show you how to take car of your new car by fixing a flat tire, check the oil and things like that.  And, they really do announce your name over the loud speaker when you purchase the car, just like in the commercial.  <br><br>
