            The Olympus series are a great set of DigiCams.  I own a D-340 R, which is just a wonderful camera.  I have a college roommate who owns a D-450 Zoom, which is absolutely fabulous as well.  Both of our cameras have superb quality and sharpness, and every camera in the series comes with software to enhance your photos any way you like.  

The D-450 Zoom Cam is an excellent buy because, unlike my D-340 R, this model allows a zoom mode capable of a deep 3x-view zoom with a pixel rate exactly the same as a normal shot.  The accompanying program is amazingly powerful: extremely versatile effects for your pleasure and humor, and digital editing to clean up your shots.

The features of this camera are very easy to use, located right at the top of the camera.  You can use these simple features to narrow in on a certain object, zoom, and enable flash.  You can also delete the pictures on the camera very easily: install the software provided, plug the camera into your computer (a cord is included which is easily attachable to the back of the CPU, whether Mac or IBM), open up your computer's main folder on the desktop, and open &quot;My Camera&quot;.  From there, all you have to do is select a picture, wait 5-10 seconds while the picture loads, make sure it is one you do not want, and hit the delete key.  

Of all the great components and features of this wonderful camera, I must include a few minor inconveniences.  First, there is a slow capture rate for red-eye reduction, even though the picture will still have red eyes (this can be quickly fixed in the included software).  So, if you are planning to take a shot of your adorable puppy, be prepared to take more than one shot before you get a really good one.  

As a second (and last) troubling component of the D-450 Zoom, my friend also asked me to fix his digital viewer (the &quot;TV&quot; in back, which is used instead of the tiny eyeglass in most cameras).  After installing new batteries, it was working again.  Unfortunately, three weeks later, Tyler (my roommate) came back asking what I had done to fix his problem.  Point being, this camera is extremely hungry for battery juice.  It is not very hard to keep replacing the four AA batteries needed to run the camera, but it does become quite cumbersome.  Apparently, there is a battery on the market from, I believe, Duracell Ultra and Energizer, which is much longer-lasting and rechargeable.  Tyler's advice is to get this life-elongated battery, even though it is a whopping $64 or so.
