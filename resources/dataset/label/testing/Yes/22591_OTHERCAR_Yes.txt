            I have now owned my 2000 GTI for about 11 months and I feel that I am qualified to review this automobile.  

The car:

2000 Volkswagen Golf GTI (3 doors)
2.0 Liter, 115 hp @ 5200 rpm, 122 Ft-lb torque @2600 rpm
Beige leather interior/Satin Silver (metallic paint) exterior
Curb weight 2,700 lbs

Let's go for a drive:

I pick up my key; it is a switchblade key with three buttons (Unlock, Lock and open hatch).  A very good design and contrary to some early reports by VW owners, I have not experienced any loose key ring in the open/close mechanism.  This key is identical to the Audi and Mercedes-Benz keys (The Mercedes has a slightly compact version).  In 11 months, the battery still operates, but I have noticed that remote distance is now shortened.  The key has a microchip imbedded in its tip that allows it to be recognised by the Electronic Security Immobilizer in the ignition switch. This switchblade remote is best used with attached keys, other wise it can easily slip from your hands and fall to the ground.

The inside story:

Now that the GTI is unarmed I open the solid door and position my self on the leather Recaro look-alike sports bucket seat (Why did VW give us fake recaros in North America?).  Closing the door, I hear a solid "thump" noise that constantly reminds the owner about the solidity of this interesting car.  The windshield is sloped with a tint towards the top.  The sun visors are stiff on operation and reveal a rectangular mirror upon use.  Interesting that the engineers placed the sun-visor mirror light on the sealing and not by the mirror to reduce glare.  Above the rearview mirror there is a small flap designed to block the sun at this spot.  I don't like it because it does not work (The one in the Audi A4 is larger and does indeed work).  The tweeters are well positioned by each of the side mirrors attachment points and this provides a good stereo imaging to the audio system.   The woofers are intelligently placed along the same vertical line relative to the tweeters and the sound quality of the eight-speaker system is excellent for a factory system when equiped with the 6-CD changer.  The radio is placed too low, but at an angle towards the driver and the heater/AC rotary knobs are below it.  Many VW owners agree that the radio should have been placed on top followed by the climate controls and then the third optional slot.  Forget about the center cup-holders, you don't need them in the GTI in my opinion.  The waste tray is red, lit and covered by a sliding high quality plastic cover.  In fact the all the plastic used in the Golf is high quality as well as the beautifully textured rubber.  One defect in the interior (the only one) is a small air bubble on the top right corner of the windshield. VW do you remember quality control?  No big deal.  Grabbing the thick leather rapped 3-spoked steering wheel is rewarding to the feel with a nice proudly displayed VW logo in the middle (get yours quick, it is being replaced).  This steering wheel telescopes in and out and tilts up and down to suit your perfect position. The 5-speed shifter is leather rapped and very smooth to operate.  The clutch is light and has the tendency to emit a squeaking sound (was lubed).  The brake pedal and the accelerator pedals are placed in such a fashion so as to be able to perform a "heal-toe" type of downshifting.  The seats have good lateral supports, are firm and yet comfortable.  You can adjust the seats to your perfect position up or down using pump action lever on the side, go back and forth and adjust the back angle.  Many of my friends cannot figure out how to tilt the back of the seat, it is a rotary knob you dummy, no not the top one but the lower one.  Indeed very confusing, the top one is for lumbar support, which works well only for short trips.  Sometimes I feel that the side bolsters dig in to my quad area.  The moon roof is excellent and the rotary knob works perfectly.  The standard mats that came with the GTI are not durable and I recommend replacing them with WeatherTech Cannon rubber mats.  Power windows are one-touch up and down and the side mirrors are remote controlled and heated when you have the defogger fan and the rear defogger button on.  The dashboard lights are a striking blue and red, both aesthetic and functional (like looking at an airport runway at night).  The headlights switch is to the left of the steering wheel and is pulled out to operate the fog lights.  The fog lights are not necessary, they don't improve vision by much. Cruise control is built into the signal lever and works well.  Wiper operation is easy and variable speeds can be selected.  Both the gas cover and hatch can be opened from the bottom of the driver's door, a convenient feature.  The back seat folds 60/40 and is higher that the front ones to improve leg space. Take note that the Golf has better head space in the back than the Jetta.  The middle headrest in the back is not necessary.  When sitting in the back seat one is not miserable but not comfortable.  The shorter you are the more comfortable you are.  On the positive side, sitting in the back seat gives you an awesome view of the beautiful dashboard, a somewhat BMW like design and look.  

The exterior story:

The GTI is identical to the base golf but with minor differences such as darkened tail lenses, built-in fog lamps in the headlights and that is it!!!  As I mentioned earlier, the fog lamps don't work that well, don't bother installing them if you have the base model.  I recommend placing aftermarket fog lights low on the bumper.  You may ask why such a minor difference from the regular Golf and the answer to my opinion resides in the philosophy behind this car.  The Golf was designed 25 years ago as a response to the oil shortage in the seventies and the increased demand for fuel-efficient environmental friendly and simple automobiles.  Starting from the 1st generation to the current 4rth generation, the Golf evolved rather than revolved.  This gives history and tradition to the car and keeps it a classy automobile.  The C-pillar is traditional VW Golf and does not change over the years.  The boxy shape evolved into a shape that fits a larger wheelbase over the generations.  The hatch door is functional and allows the GTI to swallow large items at a lower height.  Even the license plate is now on the bumper to keep the back look clean and rattle free upon closing of the hatch.  It is unmistakably Golf and I like it!  The front is aggressive and sloped parallel to the windshield to give the Golf a 0.31 coefficient of drag.  This is very impressive and results in minimal wind noise when compared to the new beetle.  This also allows the car to be more stable at highway speeds.  The Avus wheels are 15 inches in diameter, weight 15 lbs each and are easy to clean.   In summary, the Golf has a very classy yet aggressive exterior.  

The driving:

Driving around in the Golf is very special.  You get the feeling that the car is very solid and extremely tight, yet it is very nimble when driven aggressively.  You definately feel the rigidity of the body structure and because of this potent structural integrity, VW engineers where able to install soft shocks and springs.  It is hard to believe that the base Golf has softer suspension parts than this GTI.  The ride is very smooth and my first impression was that it drove like an E-class MB that my brother owned.  I say the ride is comfortable, but the anti-roll bars in the front and back keep the car together and reduce body role to a minimum.  On exit ramps it is best to attack it on the outside coming in and grab the inside through it.  Very controlled in and out of the ramp and you feel the anti-roll bars working.  The 4 cylinder although has only 115 hp output, pulls strongly on real world driving and you find your self at traffic speed with no problem.  It is smooth and has a solid feel with an exciting raspy sound at the higher engine speeds.  The smoothest normal and effortless acceleration should be done in the following way: 

1st gear rev to 4,000 rpm switch to
2nd gear and rev to 4,000 rpm switch to
3rd gear and rev to 3.200 rpm witch to 
4rth gear and rev to 3,000 rpm and finally 
hit 5 th gear and you are traveling at 60 mph @ 3,000rpm.

This keeps the engine speed around 2,600 rpm where torque is at maximum.

A 6 th gear should have been included in the GTI because at 80 mph the engine is revving @ 3,900 rpm.  However, the engine is smooth and the sound level is bearable.  In Europe the diesel Golfs come standard with 6-speeds and we may see that on our shores.  

At highway speeds the GTI flies.  The faster you go the more the car is pushed down into the ground (very Germanic Benz like character).  The car is quiet, but at speeds above 80 mph things starts to get loud and mileage suffers (30 mpg as opposed to 34 mpg at lower speeds).  

The fastest acceleration is done this way:

1st gear rev to 5,200 rpm switch quickly to
2nd gear and rev to 5,200 rpm switch quickly to
3rd gear and rev to 6,300 rpm switch quickly to 
4rth gear and rev to 6,300 rpm and with a quick diagonal push hit 
5 th gear and you are traveling @ 60 mph in about ~ 9.2 seconds.  

Yes the 2.0 GTI does it in less than 10 seconds if you drive it right.  Overall the engine performance is characterized by linear increase in power, the more gas the faster it goes.  There are no dips in the power band!!!!  This makes this 2.0 liter feel fast as well as the fact that maximum torque is reached early in the power band.

In shopping parking lots the GTI is extremely nimble and the steering is accurate, on-center and somewhat quick with absolutely no play.  You definitely feel the road through the wheel.  This is a real performance car.  The Goodyear Eagle LS tires are horrible (see my review on them) and I am very disappointed with VW for equipping the GTI with them.  At 20,500 miles they are all cupped.  I ordered larger size 205/60 HR15 BFGoodrich Comp T/A HR4 and I assume that handling will improve significantly.  The GTI does not suffer from any understeer.  The 4-wheel anti-lock brakes are excellent and stop the GTI very well all the time.  When driving with the windows down, the muffler is quiet but does not sound serious.  What sounds serious is the horn, it has a very European like sound (hard to describe) and I love it!!  Overall, the handling is very tight and nimble only because the body and chassis are very structurally rigid.  The handling is better than the front-heavy VR6 model and does not suffer from nose-diving.  It is a perfect combination of performance and comfort.  

The VW Golf GTI is an extremely safe small car.  It is fun to drive and has lots of class that cannot be classified.  For serious drivers, the GTI does not provide the maximum output that its chassis and rigid body structure can provide.  It is no surprise that aftermarket parts for the GTI are plenty to choose from.  VW designed a safe, reliable, and extremely fun sports multi-utility car for the average consumer.  This is job well done and I only wish that VW dealers could match the factory's hard work by providing better service.  Luckily, my GTI has been trouble free.  Happy driving fellow Dubs!!!!!

UPDATE...UPDATE....UPDATE...UPDATE

May 20, 2001

Hey everyone, I am impressed by the amount of people that read my review.  Anyway, my 2000 GTI has now 37,000 miles on it and I should let everyone know about its status.  Basically the car is exactly in the same shape as when I bought it.  I don't have anything major to say except the fact that the AirBag light came on about 2,500 miles after the warranty had expired. I took it to my local VW dealer and the service, you guessed it, was horrible.  The VW service guy did not know his left from his right and kept on switching his story mid sentence regarding which side the airbag was faulty (passenger or driver).  I finally was fed up and I told him that he was full of S#@#@ and that I wanted my 70 dollars back.  I had to pay $70 dollars for them to diagnose the problem.  His response was that they don't really know what the problem is and that they need to actually work on the car to figure it out and it might cost about $700 to fix.  I told him that the 70 bucks that I payed was supposed to pay for that diagnosis but alas, nothing was going to change his mind or his manager's mind.  Get this, the manager told me flat out that "It is my fault for buying a VW without getting an extended warranty".  I told him to go to hell and that I would call VW of America to complain about his treatment to me the customer.  I told him again and again that this is a safety issue and should be specially considered eventhough the basic warranty was over.  Anyway, I called VW of America that same day and filed a complaint.  Well, nothing happened, VW did not do anything about it.  So now I am driving with the airbag light on all the time not knowing whether my bags will deploy or not.  Point to the story is that VW service and warranty just plainly sucks and I advise people to either not purchase a VW or purchase an extended warranty.  

The oil burning issue with the 2.0 liter engine has diminished at 37,000 miles, but there is still some oil burning although not as much as when it was new.  The paint job is great and still looks like new (I wax my car every 6 months).  My BF Goodrich Comp T/A 205/60 tires are great and guess what? No cupping (almost 20,000 miles on them).  This compared to the really horrible Goodyear LS tires that came with the car and that cupped at 20,000 miles (see my review on them).  I maintain my beige leather interior using Lexol pH leather cleaner and conditioner.  Very beautiful leather and looks like new.  Everything in the car is still in top shape.  I am changing my own oil these days (15W40), but I don't recommend this job to anyone because of how low the front bumper is on these new VWs.  I use wooden blocks to lift the front end of the car. It is a very messy process.  The air filter is very easy to change on your own.  Forget about the spark plugs, almost impossible to get to them!  Engine coolant has been leak proof and at the same level since the beginning.  AC is running great and everything electrical in the car is working fine.  I had the front signal light go out and I replaced it my self.  The bulb (Sylvania) is $4 at VW but you can get 2 of them (Wagner) for 4 bucks from Track Auto. Changing the orange signal bulb is relatively easy although at first sight it looked kind of difficult.  The most difficult thing about maintenance is the spark plugs.  I don't know how anyone can get to them after removing the engine cover.  Oh, I carefully checked the engine after I removed the useless cover and I detect no oil leaks.  Where is some of the burnt oil going?  A mystery indeed, good thing oil consumtion is droping.

In conclusion, at 37,000 miles minus the air bag light issue, the GTI has been great.  However, I must admit that I miss my 1988 second generation Golf.  At least in that car things were simpler with much better access.  What has happened to VW?  It seems that it is not the "People's Car anymore."  In any case, this will be my car for a long time to come. I am starting Medical school this fall and it will be in the park mode for while. Happy driving!!

Airbag might or might not deploy--- ask VW about that.
