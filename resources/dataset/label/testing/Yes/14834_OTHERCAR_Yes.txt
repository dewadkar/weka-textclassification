            I bought this car, actually leased it because of the price($259) a month and I bought the 2.3 litre engine because of its fuel efficiency.  I love this car because it has never broken down, nothing has ever gone wrong with it in my 2 years of ownership.  One thing I dislike with my small engine is the lack of pickup, but I realize that I gave up power for better gas mileage.  Another small dislike is the way that they have manufactured the locks on the outside of the car.  For some reason they have placed a plastic guard, most likely to keep out water, in the the actually key slot.  This would not be a problem, except for the fact that I have had these plastic guards break and get stuck inside the lock resulting in me having to replace it.  To Mazda's credit they have replaced the locks with no charge to me since it was under warranty.
The 1998 protege provides a smooth ride even at 80mph, I love the way is has a small turning radius, and the factory speaker system is quite impressive as well.
I would recommend this vehicle to college students, young families, travelers because of its relatively low price and its dependability.<br><br>
