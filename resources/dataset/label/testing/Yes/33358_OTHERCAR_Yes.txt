            Wow, I really don't know where to start.  In the past I have given reviews mostly on cars that I did not actually own.  They were either cars of my friends or cars I just happened to know a lot about.  I own a 2000 Jetta and am proud to say I have had nothing but a tremendous experience with this thing.  

<i><b>Da Looks</b></i>
Since it's redesign in 1999, this has been one <i>HOT</i> car!!  Although silver is obviously their most popular and desired color, I chose a black one.  Black and silver are the only ones I would possibly consider.  However, they have every color available for every type of person.  The unique features on the exterior of this car are definitely the look of the front headlights and the squished in look of the trunk.  I am truly amazed by how the silver headlights look on my black car.  It stands out a hundred feet away.  Alloy wheels, front sports seats, foglamps, darkened tail lamp lenses, and a power glass sunroof are all available options.

<i><b>On The Inside...</b></i>
The partial leather package is a must.  Not only do you get leather on all the seats for less than $1000.00, but you also get those extremely luxurious heated seats.  The sounds system is great too.  It comes standard with 8-speaker stereo-cassette player, with the option of adding a 6-cd changer in the trunk.  Speakers are located on the doors of the car.  The seats are extremely comfortable.  A possible disadvantage is that mine at least doesn't have power seat adjustments.  It is extremely irritating to have to turn their crank as opposed to just lifting up a handle like all other modern cars.  Besides that, I really have no complaints about the car.   The back seats having head rests is a definite plus for comfort.  The rear seats also fold down ( all of them ) to allow you to stick extra long stuff in the trunk.

<i><b>The Models�</b></i>
The basic model for the Jetta is the GL.  Some standard features that are included in this model are a full size spare tire, a fully lined trunk with a metal plate to avoid scratching, fully galvanized steel body, lockable 60/40 split folding rear seat, child safety locks on rear doors, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, rack and pinion steering, three point safety belts, heated mirrors, anti-theft alarm system, telescoping steering wheel, power locks, 4 speed windshield wipers, 2.0 liter, 115 Hp 4 cylinder engine, clear lens halogen headlamps, and those ever cool daytime running lights.  The next step up is the GLS model.  This is the one that I chose.  In addition to the features on the GL, upgrading to the GLS gives you cruise control, power windows, power side mirrors w/ defroster and defogger, and a center front armrest.  You also get much nicer wheels than on the GL.  Also, on the GLS you can get 2 packages which are not available on the GL.  One of these is the Luxury Package.  It includes the power sunroof and those nice 15 inch alloy wheels.  This ran me almost $1000.  Once you grab the Luxury package, you can add on the Leather Package for about another $800.  It includes leather seats and steering wheel and heated seats and windshield nozzles.  The heated seats are the <b>ultimate!</b>  Next, is the GLX.  This comes with everything on the basic GLS, plus the leather stuff, wood trimmed interior, 15 inch alloy wheels, anti-theft wheel locks, power sunroof, rear sunshade, fog lamps, rain sensor controlled wipers, trip computer, and a climate control system.  It comes with a 2.8 Liter 174 Hp VR6 engine as well.  Adding the optional sport package gives you 16 inch alloy wheels and front leather sport seats.  They have definitely provided many options for you to choose from.

<b><i>Safety Features�</i></b>
The Jetta is considered one of the safer cars on the road.  One of the most important is the dual side airbags.  This was one of my principal reasons for choosing the Jetta.  Their 4 disc ABS breaks are a must.  The break wear indicator on the dash is also very nifty.  Although I don�t have kids, another nice feature are the child seat tether anchorage points in the rear outboard seating positions, which make installing a child seat more secure and much less worrisome.  Lastly, but certainly not least is that the Jetta is front-wheel drive.  This helps especially where I live because in the snow my mother�s BMW was always useless.

<b><i>Some Cool Stuff�</b></i>
The most intriguing thing to me about this car is by far the key.  Not only is it remote keyless entry, but the key actually pops out of the little box that locks and unlocks the door.  It looks almost like a switchblade�<i>ALMOST!</i>  Going along with the keyless entry is also the fact that on one �beep,� it only opens the driver�s door.  This is for your safety so that someone waiting on the other side of the car can not hop in when you unlock it.  Another cool thing is that the doors automatically lock at 9 miles per hour.  Another great safety feature.   Lights in the back seats that you can switch on are also very convenient!

<b><i>Who�s It For?</b></i>
It is said that the Jetta is a lady�s car.  Sure, the women love the car, but if you�re a guy and you get it, they will love you too.  It is a huge topic of conversation for me.  So, I suggest that guys as well as girls buy this one.  This is recommendable for teens and those in their 20�s though.  Anyone who wants a family car should probably go with the similarly priced Passat that VW also makes.  It�s a fun car, go with it.

<b><i>The Specs�</b></i>
No, I didn�t bust out my tape measure to get all of these.  They are straight from my owner�s manual, in case you care:

<b>Wheelbase: </b> 98.9 inches
<b>Overall Length: </b> 172.3 inches
<b>Width: </b> 68.3 inches
<b>Height: </b> 56.9 inches
<b>Front Head Room: </b> 38.7 inches
<b>Rear Head Room: </b> 37.2 inches
<b>Front Shoulder Room: </b> 53.7 inches
<b>Rear Shoulder Room: </b> 52.9 inches
<b>Front Leg Room: </b> 41.3 inches
<b>Rear Leg Room: </b> 33.3 inches
<b>Cargo Area: </b> 13 cubic feet

	I love my Jetta, and would strongly recommend buying one to anyone who is in the market for a car of this class.  I have no major quarrels with it.  I love the ride and I love the way it looks.  I couldn�t ask for anything better.  Well, I guess I wouldn�t pass up a Lamborghini for it if I had the chance�.
