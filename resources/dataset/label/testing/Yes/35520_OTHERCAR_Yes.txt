It is making new followers out of what used to turn potential buyers off and get on their nerves.  With <b>Kodak 1147164 and the family of Kodak DX</b>, technology is truly serving its purpose.  It's serving people.  It's become relevant to their needs.  It's recording their moments in time and memories.

Once you fall in love with using Kodak Picture Software, you will always want to have the EasyShare system.  It surely makes digital picture taking and sharing simple and easy.
