            I recently bought a 1994 Ford Probe.  After some bargaining (I bought it from a private party), I was able to get the car for $3200.  This was a great deal considering that the car was in great condition and the trade in value is almost $5000.  When I took the car home, I immediately went to get it inspected.  I then learned that I had to pay an additional $1200 for repairs.  I wasn't that discouraged however, because even with the repairs I was still paying less then the trade in value.  My experiences driving the car have been great so far.  I've had it for about a month, and haven't experienced any trouble.  It handles great and has a better turning radius than my dad's car, a 1999 Trans Am.  Rain and snow aren't a problem for me because the car has manual transmission so I control exactly how much power the car gets.  There is tons of trunk space so even when I go back up to college after Winter Break, I can fit all of my stuff in.  Lastly, the engine sounds great.  My friend who really dislikes Fords even complimented me.  The car was a really good deal for me and I recommend it.  However, it must be stated that there is very little space in the back, so it is not the best car for carpooling.
