            Well first off as you can see if you have read the other reviews, it comes highly recommended. Few reviews disagree. As with any electronic equipment these days, they are made of plastic, some parts are a little more fragile, so proper attention must be used when changing batteries and flash cards. With care this is not a problem, remember be gentle. 

This camera has gone on many motorcycle trips with me and never once has it failed to perform. I have owned it 6 weeks and already taken over 600 pics. That is an incredible savings over film, now you can afford to capture many moments you wouldn't traditionally. I would recommend purchasing at least a 64 mb flash card, i have a 128, and will store approx 130 pics at max resolution. More than enough for a several day outing. I use panasonic ni-mh batteries, which provide about 130 pics per pair at 3.1, however using the moving display will cut that down to about 40 pics. The original lithium battery that comes with the camera will take over 240 pics with the display before it dies. The only thing negative i have to say about this camera, is in low light conditions, you need to manually set iso film speed to 400, otherwise your pictures will turn out grainy. I have developed many of my prints, and you cannot tell them traditional film if not better than, shop around and you can find good prices to get them printed. I have several hanging on my wall. 

Some complain about 2x optical zoom not being enough and digital being blurry. Well this is a handheld point and shoot camera being expected to perform like an SLR. 2x is sufficient for most applications, kodak does offer a telephoto lens which screws in the front to increase range. If you plan to go beyond into the digital zoom range you can expect your pics to lose resolution, i personally have my digital zoom turned off, also you need to watch through the moving picture window when using digital zoom. 

As for the docking station, i think it is unecessary as the camera comes with a cord that plugs into the side of the camera and into a usb port, should you not have a usb port you can get an expansion card that fits into a pci slot in your computer for cheap. One fellow points out in here that there is no movie mode, and i would have to agree that it is simply a selling feature, and very unpractical to use even if it did have it. At a typical 10 frames per second, video would be very choppy and have no sound anyways. By leaving this feature out i think it shows kodak is here to make no nonsense product. 

The menu is quite easy to use, i would recommend that you go through the users manual and just familiarize yourself with all the features and how to run the menu. Keep in mind that the operation manual is on cd so you wont be able to read it in the car when you have a question.

 So when you go down to the store to pick this camera up, take the money you would have spent on a docking station, buy some nimh batteries, and a 128mb flash card, and be prepared to be extremely happy with your purchase. Again there is a reason why kodak is the leading company in photography. Prior to buying this camera, i researched several others, going on kodaks name and on many many reviews, and countless hours reviewing the samples and spec sheets, i decided on kodak, and have not once regretted it. I know when i have a good thing. Enjoy

I already wrote that review for futureshops website, but i had a few more things i wanted to add. It would be nice if there was an uncompressed mode but that is very impractical because you would be back down to a few pics on a 128 meg card. I remember 1 fellow saying something about a lot of background noise, and yes there is a fair share of that on occasions. However this only becomes a problem when you look at a 3.1mp picture on you computer at full 1:1 viewing, and how often is that, a 3.1mp pic viewed at 1086 x whatever looks brilliant, and that happens to be the size of most screens, when you get it printed out, on an 8x10 it will look even better than it does on screen.  this product is fully recommended considering what you get for the price. So unless your living in a dream world, you'll be happy with what this camera can do.
