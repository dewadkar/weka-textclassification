            I must first start out by saying that i love the room .I went from a 2 door cavalier to the Grand Voyager. We bought our in Sept of &quot;98&quot; but it was a demo(floor model) and it was a good price and it only had 2600 miles . Ours came with the built in car seats(2 in the middle bench) for children up to 40 lbs, Alarm , tint and other options. Mechanically it has been great. I have yet to take it to the shop for engine problems. 
My problem is that they make cars ,trucks and minivans flimsy anymore. The kids on my block were playing in the street someone throw the ball and it hit my door and there was a big dent. I mean come on now matchbox cars have been thrown out windows, ran over and crashed with less damage. Another thing is that because of my alarm and the auto locking doors there is a sensor in the doors well Lately when i hit bump my light start flashing and the bell for open door goes off, then i hit the break it stops. I feel like i'm in a disco. LOL
I am taking it in to HOPEFULLY have this problem fixed. But i noticed the other day my neighbor who has the same Van ,same year was having the same problem. I mean considering all the possible problems cars have with lemons ect. This isn't really a major problem But i would ask about the doors when i bought one and hopefully it was just the year. 
If you wanted to buy a Plymouth Voyager you will need to go soon because a few months ago i received a letter from the company(Plymouth/Chrysler and Dodge same company) that they are doing away with the Plymouth Lines of Vechicals. Which in opinion stinks because they are all the same Except your the front emblems and Price i mean 5-10 thousand more as you go up the line . All that for somethings that are options on the Voyager But are Standard on a Town and Country. The funniest part about it was when i took the 98 car guide and added up all the option to make it a &quot;Town and Country&quot; It was still cheaper!! <br><br>
