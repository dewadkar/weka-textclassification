            ...and i'd probably buy a third. by doing nothing but changing the oil and rotating the tires, i have never had a problem with either of my gs-r's.  this car is great for expressway driving where you can really let it loose and use the vtec engine where appropriate.  the gas mileage is pretty good for a sports car, and the handling allows for great maneuverability.

i bought this car for the combination of looks, performance, and reliability, and it hasn't let me down yet.  

the only downside about this car is it's handling in the snow. although it is front-wheel drive, the traction is not the greatest in the snow.  i live in the midwest, so this is sometimes a problem.  but that's why my other car is a 4x4.

the other downside of this car is the high insurance cost, due to the number of integras that are turned into low-riders, or otherwise souped up.<br><br>
