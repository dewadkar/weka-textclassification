            I was looking for a no nonsense starter digital camera and found the DX3215 to fit the bill. It gave me the biggest bang for the buck ($299.00 CDN ). Set up was easy and I was ready to go in minutes. I love the fact that it has an optical zoom as well as a digital zoom. Both producing fantastic results even in the " good " mode.

A big plus is that the optical viewfinder closely matches if not right on that of the LCD screen so no compensating is needed. The back panel is nicely laid out and even big fingered people can use the buttons comfortably.

The 8MB internal memory is adequate. (about 20 pics in " best " and about 75 in the " good " mode. I do recommend getting at least a 16MB MMC/SD card though.

The docking cradle was not in stock when I purchased my camera. But I'm sure its as easy to use as Kodak says it is. The supplied USB and video cables make downloading to your PC and viewing on a TV a snap.

Kodak wasn't fooling around when they said not to use alkaline batteries. I did as a test and got about 20 minutes of use before it died on me. Lithium and NiMH rechargeable batteries work best and give long use times. 175 pics on rechargeable's and 350 with lithiums. Less if you use the LCD screen and the flash. Speaking of the flash..Despite what the spec sheet says on this site. It does have a built in flash. And its multi-mode as well.

The software package downloaded and worked perfectly for me. The email portion was a breeze to use. But I wish Kodak had more features in the picture editing area. IE: Adobe Photo-shop features.

I did try to print out pictures on my HP Deskjet 895C. The results were ok when printing the " good " mode pics. But when printing out the " best " mode pics I got very satisfactory results. Colors were good true to life and the sharpness exceptional.

Over all, Kodak has impressed me with a quality camera that is perfect for those wanting to start in digital photography. A BIG THUMBS UP to Kodak on this camera!
