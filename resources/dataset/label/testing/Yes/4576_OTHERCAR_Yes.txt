            We got our Elantra new in 1997. It was a 4DR auto am/fm and AC. It was our first new car.  We test drove it and loved it.  It had nice space inside.  it would fit both of the car seats at the time.  
After we brought it home it started acting up.  It would slip out of gear.  We took it back to the dealer since it was under warrenty.  They fixed the problems.
We drove it all over.  My husband drove it to work everyday.  We took it on family outtings/trips.  I loved it.  It is a great car.  And it really dosnt look like a family car.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  That was one of my husbands biggest issue is that he didnt want a car that looked the the 'type' of family car people think about...like station wagons.
I recommend this car to anyone,students, families, anyone who enjoys a nice looking car and a great price.<br><br>
