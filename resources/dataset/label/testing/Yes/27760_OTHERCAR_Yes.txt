            After hearing about Digital Cameras for the past year or so, I finally decided to ask for one last Christmas.  After some research, I decided on the Canon Supershot S100.  After three months with the camera, <b>I love it!</b>

<b>Small Size</b>
This camera is not the smallest one out there, but packs a huge number of features into a small, sleek case.  This is probably the best part of this camera.  How many other cameras can you take to a dance club and bring onto the dance floor with you?  The only problem with doing that is that strangers will come up to you asking to have their pictures taken so that you can email it to them.

<b>Good pictures</b>
As well as being small, this camera takes excellent pictures.  The lowest resolution is 640x480, good enough for viewing on a computer screen.  The highest resolution is 1600x1200, a resolution that you can use to print pictures at Kinko's, or upload to OFoto.com, photos.yahoo.com, or any other web site.  This ability is the reason I wanted the camera, and has been great!  No more need to try to split my "free" doubles with 3 people!

<b>Picture Capacity</b>
OK, the 8 Mb Compact Flash Card that the camera comes with is basically useless.  For $100 more, I went to Costco and got a 64 Mb chip - at the 640x480 resolution it holds over 380 pictures!!  You can store over 100 pictures.  No more fumbling around for new film.  And then any pictures you don't like you can delete easily - so you get even more.

<b>Sleek Look</b>
Everyone, including me, loves the look of the camera.  Enough said.

<b>Good software</b>
At first, I thought the Zoombrowser EX software the camera came with would get in the way of the camera.  But I realize that I need it more than almost anything else.  Basically like a HUGE scrapbook, you aren't more than a couple of clicks away from any picture.


Now for the cons ...


<b>Incorrect ViewFinder</b>
This, for me, is the most annoying part of the camera.  When you look through the viewfinder, the picture that comes out actually covers more area that you see.  This means that you are constantly moving closer to the picture than you want to.

<b>Small Zoom</b>
I wish you could zoom in more.  The 2x zoom isn't enough.  But for me, because I am usually taking pictures of people, it doesn't really bother me.

<b>No Close-ups</b>
You cannot get any closer than ~2 feet.  Pictures start to get fuzzy after that.  But again, I take pictures of people, not flowers.

<b>Cost</b>
This can be a big one.  To get the best use out of the camera, you need to buy two more peripherals.  I mentioned the 64 Mb Compact Flash.  Add 100 bucks to the cost for that one.  To take advantage of the new 64 Mb card, you'll need to spend another 50 dollars to get another battery because you'll go through one in a couple of hours (but that was at a New Year's Party).

So:
Camera:    $400
64Mb Card: $110
Battery:   $50
----------------
Total:     $560
