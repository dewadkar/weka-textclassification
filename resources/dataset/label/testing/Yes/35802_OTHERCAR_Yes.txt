            I am the least qualified person to write a review about a car, I have gone 12K miles without changing my oil, solved the problem of a rapidly and steadily deflating tire by adding air to it everday for a month, and drove my car until it crawled to a stop on the side of the highway from lack of gas.  Don't even make me admit what the mechanic said my cadalit.. conver...whatever looked like after I finally had to be towed to the shop.
I didn't take care of my car for almost two years, finally, I had to do something about it - I got a boyfriend.  Thankfully, not only did I get a great boyfriend, now fiance, that changes my oil every 3K miles but I had bought a car that could handle two years of abuse.
I bought my Saturn because I would not have to haggle with a salesman.  The gold paint glimmer in the winter's dreary gloom, the sunroof slide opened and closed with a reassuring mechanical purr, and I could control all the windows from a niffty collection of buttons in the center.  These were the things that were important to me.  It really did not seem necessary to worry about the detail or the impact of the fact the car had 98,000 miles on it was only 3 years old.  I bought it.  
As I stated earlier luckily I bought a car that could handle two years of abuse.  In spite of the fact my car had 98,000 miles on it when I bought it and now has 131,000 I've only had one problem.  About 1 year ago I had to get the cataly... conve...whatever replaced.  It was only $275 which everyone tells me is pretty cheap.
My only real dislike is the painted bumpers.  As you can imagine I'm the kind of person that bumps things with her bumpers which means I have cracked and peeling gold paint on various points of my bumpers.
Also my fiance tells me my Saturn burns oil.  I don't know what it is suppose to do with oil but the way he says, &quot;You car BURNS oil&quot; makes me think it isn't suppose to do that.
