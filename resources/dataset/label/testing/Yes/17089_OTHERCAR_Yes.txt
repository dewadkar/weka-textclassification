                 I'd have to say that I wasn't really looking for a SUV when I started my quest for a replacement vehicle. I was retiring a Chevrolet Pickup lease and was looking for something different.  I talked to my salesman at the Mercedes dealership where I had taken a lease on a C280.  The convertible Benz I lusted for was just too much.  The salesman asked if I would be interested in an ML430.  Never being one to turn down a test drive, I agreed to drive one.  What a machine!  
     Before I left, I had leased a 1999 ML430.  The color is called Ebony and when the light is right, it does look black, but in the sun, it is a beautiful blue-black metallic.  
     The real treat is the powertrain; the 268hp 4.3L V-8 is a gem.  It is quick to start, and pulls strongly from about 2500rpm through 6000, at which point the excellent five-speed automatic selects the next gear.  Through clever power management, courtesy of computer controls, the engine power is modulated, even under full throttle, to allow for smooth shifting.  You can hear the engine change speed as the next gear comes in, but the flow of power remains smooth. One of the real trips is the sound the engine makes under full throttle.  You can hear the racing heritage when you stand on the gas pedal. 
     Like my C-class, the seats are absolutely perfect.  Mercedes has always impressed me with what seems to be a hard seat cushion.  However on long trips, that firmness is a real pleasure.  The M has heated front seats, and this is my first experience with such devices.  They work very well.  I'm afraid that when it gets really cold, my wife will take over the M just because of the seats. I would like a power headrest like my C-Class has. 
     The feel of all the controls is something I really enjoy all the switches have a good, solid feel and give good feed back when pushed.  I am curious why Mercedes Benz didn't standardize the controls more between it's SUV and cars. I like the rotary headlight on the dash of my C-class better than twisting the end of the turn signal lever in the M. However, I do like the cup holder on the extreme left side of the dash in the M (where the headlight switch might have been!).  So, it's an acceptable trade off. I could go on.  
     If someone is looking for a very well built SUV with the heart of a tiger and a grip on the road like a four-wheel magnet, this is a must drive.  Its independent suspension coupled with traction control, and ABS (all standard) make it quite a package.  I'm now wishing for deep snow so I can really have some fun! The build quality of my M is every bit as good as that of my C-class.  American workers can build a good German vehicle!<br><br>
