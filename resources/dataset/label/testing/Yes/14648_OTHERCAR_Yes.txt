            Is the Scoupe for you?  Well, to start, I got this car from a friend of mine.  Parents spent around $1500 dollars so far, only had to get a new transmission into it and a paint job.  Still have to get a new back bumper and get the insides of the door painted black.  Also a new tint job, the old job has a bunch of bubbles, I hate that, and it turned purple.  I do have fog lights, there pretty nice, they're yellow and I love them.  I just turn them on when it's dark and when it's light out side, but not scorching sun light.  Know what I mean?  Other features, the brakes a great, they stop me at a decent speed and if I need to can come to a halt, pretty fast.  What more can you ask from a car?  If you got into an accident with this car, than your riding the bumper of the person in front of you.


The ride is pretty nice.  Better than my dad's Grand Am.  It's a 5 speed and I haven't used one for a while.  It didn't take me too long to get use to it.  They replaced the clutch and a bunch of other stuff.  So I didn't have to replace too much in it.  The only thing is that it is pretty small, I have the '91 version.  It's painted black, which seems to show dust a lot more than any other cars, but that is to be expected.  A lot of Construction sites in my area doesn't help.  I haven't been in it long enough to notice any mechanical problems, I did have to replace a couple fuses, but that was due to hooking up the stereo I believe.  So, only time will tell whether or not what kind of car I have to give it.  I might have to wash it often, we have way too much construction going on for a black car.  


A big plus though is that, <b>It's Mine</b>.  :)  The gas mileage is ok, It's almost as good as the Grand Am, it gets me around, have to fill up once a week. That's because I always drive around and it's a small tank.  I love it, it could be the fact that it is mine, and I don't pay for anything on it.  But the other people seem to like it and so do my friend's at that.  Especially my one friend that is always talking about his cars and stuff.  It also meets my need for speed, I'm pretty sure, most of you can see were I'm coming from.  For example, when it's two lanes and both traffic is flowing and here comes the dotted lines.  Then, someone popes up in front of you going 10 under the speed limit.  I'm pretty sure you can guess what happens after that.  :)  Well, that's my review, thanx for stopping by.
