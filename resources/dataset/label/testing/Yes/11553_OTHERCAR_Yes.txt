            Our family purchased a fully loaded '99 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  It was purchased primarily for my use and my husband drives it only occasionally.  I love the rugged look of the Cherokee and it performs very well for a SUV.  It has a somewhat bumpy ride, but not as bad as other SUV's in its class that we test drove.  It handles well on snow, ice and off road.  The interior has all the nice extras such as a CD/cassette stereo system with Infiniti speakers, A/C and a really cool overhead console display for outside temperature, direction, fuel until empty and gas mileage plus two compartments to store sunglasses and garage door opener.  The center console really comes in handy too for CD storage and two sizes of cup holders.  The front seats are comfortable with plenty of leg room, even for tall people.  However, the back seat is a bit narrow with rear doors that seem cut too short.  Getting in and out of the backseat is a bit uncomfortable.  We also found it difficult fitting our infant carseat back there, as it is now, it rests up against the backs of the front seats.  Despite the backseat and rear doors being a bit on the small side, the rear storage area in the back is plenty large enough for whatever you need to store whether its luggage for a trip, strollers and baby equipment or the family dog.  We have a 75 lb. dog who has plenty of leg room back there.  We've had this vehicle for over a year now and it's never had one mechanical problem.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone despite the two drawbacks of the back seat.<br><br>
