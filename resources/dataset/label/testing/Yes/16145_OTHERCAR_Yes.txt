            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best modern SUV on the market.  It has an excellent blend of on road performance with off road prowess that creates an excellent utility vehicle.  Every combination available is great.  My parents own a 1997 2WD I-6 Laredo, and on our last trip up to Mammoth Mountain, we took a little &quot;off road&quot; trip on a light duty trail.  Even with the 2WD, it handled excellently off road.  The 195hp 4.0L 6- cylinder is very powerful, and has alot of torque (230 ft-lbs).  New for this year is a silky 235hp 4.7L V-8 that puts out 295 ft-lbs of torque.  Both of these motors get great gas mileage.  I am a little depressed about the removal of the 5.9L powerplant, especially the 5.9 Limited Edition, the fastest, most powerful SUV on the planet. (This motor is available in the Grand Cherokee's cousin, the Dodge Durango, which I also recommend) The Command Track 4WD system is the best, most advanced 4WD system on the market today.  The Grand Cherokee is available in Laredo or Limited trim, I prefer the Laredo, simply because the plastic bumpers are better for off roading, they don't have paint to scratch.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best SUV on the market today, and is a great compromise between off road performance and on road capabilities<br><br>
