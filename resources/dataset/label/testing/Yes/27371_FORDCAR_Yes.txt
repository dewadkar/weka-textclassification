            I can't believe out test drive of the new 2001 Ford Super Crew F-150! It has the size and power of a full size work horse but one look inside will convince you - this is No ordinary truck. The stylish features include a two-tone dash, extra-plush seating, fashionable grab bars, well appointed easy to read dash, steering wheel controls, matching head rests, a handy center console plus drink containers and pockets in the door panels for extra storage.  Also the roomy back seat could easily seat three adults and the back seats fold 40/60 to allow for lots of extra storage.
The ride was smooth as glass and plenty of pep for the highway. It was easy to handle in traffic and visibility was excellent as well. My husband (a GMC man) is built like a bear and he had too agree this truck has a lot to offer. The towing package also comes with a larger radiator for more efficient cooling while towing. The exterior color I really was drawn to was the new Island Blue.
 The bed is 5'5&quot; but there is an optional bar extension that will give you 7' of hauling space for $195.00.  Great appeal for both the luxury details for the ladies and brute strength for the guys. Plus room for teenagers in the back seats - I recommend it for a terrific family vehicle!  <br><br>
