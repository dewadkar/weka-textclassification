            Ever since I got my license, I wanted a Dodge pickup truck. For awhile I was stuck with my parents 1990 Toyota Corolla, but finally on June 19, 2000, I got my Dodge truck I always wanted. It was a 1993 Dakota 2WD club cab with a Magnum V-6 and standard transmission. I could not be more pleased with it. It was very clean and obvious the previous owner took care of it. It had 100,000 miles on it, which some said was too high for a '93, but with a MOPAR engine, there is plenty of life left in it. 
The truck drives very smooth and straight. Shifting is effortless and it has plenty of pick-up and go. Everything in the cab is placed where it is easy for the driver, and there is plenty of room, even in the back, for a person to sit comfortable. Gas mileage is decent at around 17 or 18 MPG in the city. Plus, there is numerous after market products out there for those who wish for a little more out of the engine.
There is a very big and loyal following for Dodge and MOPAR, so if you purchase this or another Dodge vehicle, you should never be far from someone with insight on how to fix problems, which will not be too often. 
Whatever you chose to purchase, if not a '93 Dakota, you will be pleased with it if it's a Dodge. Dodge make some of the best vehicles around in my opinion and their engine lineup is very impressive. Their engines are some of the strongest, most reliable around. They drive very smooth and straight and are pleasing to the eye, no matter what year and model.
Anyone who is in the market for a truck should consider buying this vehicle. It's small enough to be an ease to drive around town, yet large enough to have plenty of room for passengers and whatever you need to put in the bed. It could be too small to be used as a work truck, but it's not really made for that. I highly recommend this truck to anyone in the market looking for a truck.<br><br>
