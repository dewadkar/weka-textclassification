                 Most people think when they see a 4 or 6 cylinder that is probably not going to be enough enough power. Don't be so quick to classify this car in the same stereo type. It has enough get up and go to get around the mountains that are around where i live. Has excellent gas mileage it has gotten from state to state on less then a half a tank of gas for me. Plus it has a nice sporty look i know my teenage sun likes driving it around much more then my 1993 Camaro Z28. So all in all it is a wonderful car, so i recommend this car to anyone who doesn't have a lot of money cause it is a low priced car that is probably going to last a long time.<br><br>
