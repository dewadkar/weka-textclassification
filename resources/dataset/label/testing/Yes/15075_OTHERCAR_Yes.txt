            I'm definitely an amateur in cameras.  I bought this camera to use on the Internet auctions.  I feel it takes very good close-up pictures and does a better job than my scanner.  I save money on development and time on scanning.  It was very easy to use and I was taking pictures of the hummingbirds on the back porch in no time at all.  You know how fast hummingbirds move and I was able to catch them in flight.

I took this camera on a trip and was happy with pictures taken in good daylight.  When I took the time to make sure all settings were correct and the camera was focused I got pretty good pictures.  Just like any camera, you have to decide what you want to focus on and take a good look at the background.  We visited a Butterfly observatory and I was able to get some incredible pictures.

It was a little strange at first to look at the view screen instead of putting the camera up to your eye but I got use to that.  I loved the idea of being able to just take a bunch of floppies with me so I could take as many pictures as I wanted and looking through the pictures as you go along to see how you are doing.  If you don't like it, just delete it and take another - just that simple.  If you run out of room, no need to carry the computer around with you to download, just run into the nearest store and buy some more floppies.  You can run the pictures in series on the next disk if you are going to have lots of pictures of the same trip, etc., thus being able to keep the floppies in order.

I think I could have gotten clearer distance shots with my 35mm but most of the pictures came out just fine but the close ups were really good.

And the nicest part - when everyone wants copies of the pictures - just email them and you're done.  No running to get more processed.  No more money spent on duplicates.  No more snail mail.  Download the pictures you want to keep and reuse the floppies.  And if Mom just has to have a 5x7, just print it out on your printer.

Can you tell - I love it!  I showed it to my doctors wife and the next time I was in, he gave me a hard time because she went and bought one &lt;grin&gt;.<br><br>
