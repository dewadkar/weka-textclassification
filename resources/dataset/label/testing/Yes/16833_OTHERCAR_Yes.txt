            Over the past few years, I've owned and extensively driven several sports cars that run the gamut from 'almost stock' to wildly modified.  These include import turbo cars, V8's, V12's, supercharged, nitroused, etc!  The Z28 is by far my favorite choice for Bang for the Buck performance.

All of the currently produced Camaros offer a mix of good looks, fun (t-tops are awesome!), and performance (the 200hp V6 rivals the performance of Ford's Mustang GT!).

If it's box-stock performance and reliability you are searching for, look no further than the Chevrolet Camaro Z28.  For around $20k brand new, you'll have a car that rattles off easy low 5 second 0-60's, 13 second range 1/4 mile times, and stops just as good!

However, if you are into modifying your ride for maximum 'performance' - you've also got the right car in mind.  With a few basic and inexpensive modifications to the intake and exhaust of your vehicle, you will own a perfectly reliable 12 second 1/4 mile road car!  For more information on those mods see http://www.ls1.com or email me and I'll point you in the right direction!<br><br>
