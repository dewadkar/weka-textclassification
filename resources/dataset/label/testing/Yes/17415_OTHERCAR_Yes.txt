            I bought my 4Runner new in Feb 1998. <b>I've never regretted my decision.</b> I shopped around looking at, and driving, the Pathfinder, Montero Sport, and Discovery. Driving those vehicles made my choice that much easier. I wanted a versatile vehicle that was comfortable enough for all-day road trips as well as off road excursions, especially in snow. I found exactly what I was looking for. 
I knew that I wanted a 5-speed with a sunroof, nothing else. That was a very tough combination to find as almost every 4Runner comes with a "Value Package" that includes running boards, trailer hitch, and rear wind deflector. I didn't want any of those dealer installed "values" nor an automatic, and after much searching I found just the right rig as a "loss leader" at a local dealer. 
I feel that the 4Runner is one of the best styles in any SUV. Thats why they don't need to change it every 2 years!
It has never required anything other than normal maintenance in 41,000 miles. It drives smoothly compared to all of the other SUVs I tested, but still has a somewhat choppy ride. I wonder why others complain about the ride knowing that they bought a vehicle based on a truck platform? It performs off road flawlessly having only been stuck once when I <i>buried</i> it in a snowbank.
With 41000 miles behind me, I can recommend this vehicle to anyone thinking about a truck-based SUV. I would buy another one immediately if I needed to. It is solid, reliable, and will be with me until the day it draws its last breath (unless I go first).
