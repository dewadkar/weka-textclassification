            The 1999 Corolla is a great car.  It is a great car for students or families because it is reliable and runs great.  The backseats aren't the &quot;roomiest&quot; in the world, but the car has 4 doors so it is roomy enough.  I've only had to put it in the shop once in the year I've had it, because the airbag light kept blinking, but it was under warranty and they fixed it for free, so it was no big problem.  The only bad things are that it doesn't take turns so great, my tires squeak if I go very fast at all, so if you're into turning really fast, you might not enjoy this car as much as others.  Another thing is that for the price, it is only about a medium-attractive car.  I like the way it looks now, but it doesn't stand out so great, I just don't like the shape of it too much, and I feel that in only a few years it won't have aged well as other cars (for example, FIREBIRDS look great now and will look great even when it gets to be an older car).  I have yet to see how the 1999 model will age, but in one year and 7000 miles I've only had that airbag problem.  <br><br>
