            I spent a week with this car in California and it was a rather pleasant experience! I flew out to San Francisco on business and when Avis pointed me the direction of this 1999 Malibu I was like, &quot;What?! No way! This is what I get for a week?!&quot;

Not that I had a bad opinion of the Chevy Malibu, it's that I had no opinion at all and was expecting something more (i.e. Taurus, Intrepid, etc.). But this little car impressed me. I was on a trip that took me from SF to Sacramento to Fresno to Orange County and all over LA within 5 days and this mid-size performed admirably. 

I put 807 miles on the car between city and highway driving and got great gas mileage for the duration. Used 2.25 tanks of gas during the entire time! The car handles well and is fairly comfortable to sit in for long stints on the road. It lacks a little pick-up on inclines (mountain driving) but otherwise is quiet, smooth ride.

The car is a little smaller inside than my Nissan Altima but all the controls are well thought out. One thing that bugged me was the rear windshield seemed a bit high creating a strange blindspot for me in that rear right corner. Maybe it's just me but the first night I had the car I accidentally cut someone off downtown San Francisco because I didn't see them. But once I got used to that, I was able to compensate so I wouldn't have a problem like that again.

Before renting this Malibu for a week, I would've never given this car a thought. But now it's actually a car I'd recommend to someone looking for an affordable car in it's class. Rent one sometime and see for yourself. You too might be impressed!<br><br>
