            I owned a '93 Dodge Caravan, it was paid for. However, I was taking my six year old daughter &amp; her girlfriend out with me to to the store. When, we were broad sided by a woman who ran a red light. It was the most terrifying experience I have ever had to deal with in my life.

 Luckily, we all walked away from the accident with minor injuries and the trauma of the whole experience. My daughter still has nightmares about the event. The impact caused us to do a complete 360 in the middle of the intersection. My car was totaled.

 I just want to say that the impact and damage could of been a lot worse than what it was. We got hit on the side where the gas tank is located. It could of exploded and my daughter could of been seriously hurt. However, due to the stability &amp; dependability no one was seriously hurt. I have sent Dodge a letter and a picture of the car, to let them know that they did a really good job in building and designing the minivan.<br><br>
