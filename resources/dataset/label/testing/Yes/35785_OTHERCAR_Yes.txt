            I have a 1997 Saturn SL1 that we bought used a few months ago. It's a 4-door, 5-speed. We do A LOT of highway driving, and have already put about 8,000 miles on it in just a few months. It gets great mileage and I have never had a major problem with it. Even with a few minor problems, the Saturn dealership has always been very helpful and extremely nice. They paid for our lunch one day so they could fix something small on it while we were eating. When they forgot to give us the key for the armrest and I had to drive back to the dealership to get it, they gave me more money for the inconvenience. They patched my tire for free when they discovered there was a nail in it. 

I love the smooth ride that I get in this car. I love the remote gas tank and trunk releases. The back seat is roomy enough for 2 adults to sit comfortably, without having their knees up their noses. I love the fact that you can adjust the height of the shoulder belts, especially for someone like me who isn't very tall. This way, the belt isn't always cutting into my neck, which is what happens a lot in other cars.

The only things this car doesn't have that I would have liked are power door locks, power windows, remote keyless entry, and I kind of wish it was an automatic (only because it would be easier to tend to my son if I had a hand free sometimes). Also, we have a bit of a hard time getting my son's carseat in the middle rear of the car without it wobbling some. It takes some work, but my husband can eventually get it tight.<br><br>
