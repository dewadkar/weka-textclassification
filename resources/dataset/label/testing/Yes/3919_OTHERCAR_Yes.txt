            Oh, shucks...the pronounced hood and grill fooled me!!!! I wondered why the interior seats were flatter, the dash farther away, and I never saw that much room in the back seat...oh, the seat is smaller. But the stereo sure sounded better than my faithful Dodge. Ok, if you've read this far I'll give you some facts. 

Powertrain, 
Chevy has made available the large vortec V6 along with a venerable 327 and 350 V8's to make your choices easy. I drove my buddy's with the HP 350, yeah the Z71. I was impressed, but again..I thought it was a dodge from a distance. The Z71 accelerated fast enough to surprise a few 4.6L mustangs at the local red light. As far as particulars, this is an opinion....I'm no expert and neither are you. The transmission shifted quickly and before the power curve, I enjoyed that, my faithful Dodge likes to hang out until slightly after the peak of the power curve. (maybe there's less pressure on the shifter plates, might improve the life of the tranny). Anyway, I couldn't tell if it had posi-trac or not, since neither my friend or I got out and watched the tires to see if they both burned rubber. 

Ability
My buddy has a 21 ft Mastercraft ski boat, and if you know anything about ski-boats...it's one heavy mutha! I couldn't even feel the thing behind this truck as we towed it along. Although, my buddy felt it one day when he trusted a co-worker to secure the ball-lock...his co-worker didn't do it right and after the first bump...he felt this mysterious push about 5 or 6 times when he came to a stop. Oh the angst he endured while the Z71 was in the shop getting a new tailgate, and he only had the thing two weeks! (Moral, secure your own trailer ball-lock!!!!)

Adornments
The truck had the CD/Cass/AM-FM stereo that made my ears ring. It was loud, I don't mean amount of noise, I mean a tremendous amount of music and energy came from each speaker location. The seats, yeah, chevy/gmc/caddy they all go for the flat seats that make you feel like your in another state. (maybe thats why their so popular, puts alot of distance between passengers). But, they are also well sprung and with each jounce you thank yourself for securing the seat belt. I'm 6' @ 265, my buddy is 6'3 and 310, we rode well and he loved the truck. He had to, 6.5 yrs away from full ownership, the denial was prevalent. I didn't take time to note what reproductive specimen any of the gauges represent in any of the three. The Chevy still takes on the futuristic 'superflat' gauge pane, looks somewhat tacky, but the decision makers try their best. While the ford's sloped interior makes it hard to orientate yourself to which way is forward. If your concerned about what the air conditioner or power buttons look like to decide what to buy, keep your 73 microbus. It's about buddy appeal and what drives good ole competition, for that I'll always be happy with my Dodge...the best kept secret!

MY OPINION, it looks terribly close to a Dodge, (and so does the new 'nose' on the fords). Can't anyone be original anymore, or is the market just that strong? I appreciated Chevy's try, good one, If I weren't so brand loyal I'd buy one. Here's the kicker in my OPINION VS well any other advisor/lead/whatever....it's a bad-*ss truck, if you like Chevy's and can afford the 34G's...go for it. If your choice is between the Chevy/Ford/Dodge equivalent models, well, here's when it gets sticky. 

Comparisons, 
My buddy has an older brother who drives a 2000 Ford OFFROAD, equipped almost identically except for the paint. The Z71 is champagne, the OFFROAD is burgandy. Leather interiors, CD/CASS/AMFM stereos, I had access to a Dodge attempt at this segment in the SPORT OFFROAD with the same amenities, (white with gray interior). The ford didn't seem to accelerate as quickly as either the Chevy or Dodge. The Ford has lots of low end torque, but flattened out quickly in the power curves. 

The Chevy had a 350, Dodge a 360, the Ford a 351. The Chevy and Dodge look very similar while the Ford looks like an unhappy puppy waiting for a bone. All prices were in the 32-35G range. All had leather. You choose, my opinion is the Dodge for it's long lived, much copied, and muscular looks. All else being within square and cubic inches apart. One thing you can get with the Dodge VS the others...a V10 iron-horse! {Now I wonder how many reviews from nintendo junkies and bookworms will include comments about details...less they forget, its about opinions).  So how 'bout it advisor/leads/whatevers...do I get points for objectivity? (something your opinions lack).
