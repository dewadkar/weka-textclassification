   I read about the RX300 for the first time in the New York times, comparing it with the ML320 of the Mercedes Benz.  It was before I bought my own RX300.  The reporter, a woman, called the RX300 the SUV for a lady.  The vehicle was everything was supposed to be as a SUV, but with  soft, gentle and user-friendly qualities.  The article compared the luxury of the Lexus vehicle versus the expensive but disappointingly  cheap poor quality of the interiors of the ML320.  While the Mercedes machine still keeps some of the truck-like qualities of many big SUVs, the RX300 is always smooth and silent in the street.  It's is probably the most car-like of all the SUVs in the market.
  I think, now that I have been driving one for the last year, it's a very good description of the RX300.  But wait!, I am a man, and it didn't make me very happy to call the RX300 the SUV for a lady, because I liked the same features in the RX300.
  The fact is the RX300 is the perfect SUV for any person that wants a SUV but doesn't need the rough look or the sweaty effort of most big truck-like SUVs to feel OK with himself.  And it's a good deal for your buck.  For all the luxury you can say the bill is between $34,000 to $42,000, which is a lot less than the big trucks you can see around.  The engine, the roadside handling, and the power are exceptional.  The number of gallons-per-mile is better than my previous car, a GS300 (Lexus).  I drive from Manhattan to East Hampton (over 220 miles) most week-ends and the round trip plus the errands to the store (with the NY gas prices!) is never more than $22 or $23. The cargo space is smaller than bigger SUVs, but if you don't work as a mover it's probably enough for all you will buy for your house, from the groceries to the new cabinet. You can see that many manly men will like these qualities in a SUV.
  The only limitation I can tell is that if you want a vehicle to be around mostly in your farm, or to drive in the great outdoors, then you must buy a different SUVs.  The truth is that most people don't need to drive such rugged machine, even if you have the money to buy a Hummer. But truly, it's a limitation to consider here.   <br><br>
