            I wanted an AWD CAR, reasonable size, standard transmission... I was moving from a Ford Explorer and CAR had become key.  Living in New England with an uphill driveway (pretty dumb huh?) A6, V70, or Subaru... those were the choices.  

In January 2001, I walked into the Audi dealer and asked about standard transmissions.  They had dumped standards on the 2.8 for 2001, but luckily had a 2000 A6 leftover.  One drive and I was hooked.  The 2.8 may not be the most powerful engine, but with the 5 speed manual, I could get whatever I wanted out of it.  The car cornered, flew on the highway, and just felt great to drive.  Hit 80 going up a hill on a back road and didn't realize it until I looked down.

I made my best deal, 37K with tons of features... cold weather, high-end stereo, CD changer, moonroof, xenon lights, premium package, side airbags,quattro (of course)...

How could I resist... I went and drove a V70 and bought the audi that afternoon.

I can't stop driving it... in 8 months, I've put 21K on it... I feel awful but I feel great!  I am hooked! 

Here are some of my experiences....

In early February, we had this terrible snow storm here in Massachusetts.  I decided to "test" the AWD on the way home...  I found this old "farm road" that had 12 inches of snow and wasn't plowed.. I drove on it.  The farmer that was plowing his driveway did a double take before waving... couldn't believe I had come up HIS road in this stuff.  The car handled the snow perfectly.

One night, I was on my way home and noticed that I was doing over 100 on the highway... smooth and clean drive.

My boss has a BMW 540i automatic... won't race me on a windy road.... the standard and AWD scare him.

I can throw this car around corners at an unbelievable speed, even though sometimes it feels like I'm riding on the sidewalls of the tires... maybe I'll switch tires later.

Alright... now for the problems....

I hit a pot hole driving at about 60mph with my fancy wheels... cost me $650 for the new wheel and tire... my fault.  But nothing else broke!

The switch controlling the rear windows broke, the drivers side window got stuck in the down position (thank god there was no rain)... it was a clip, rear door trim loosened on a hot day, and bent when it caught on the front door.

My dealer (Wagner Motors in Boylston, MA) must be special (after reading other owner's comments).  When I brought the car in for these problems... and emergency because of the driver side window, they immediately found me a loaner, and fixed everything in one day.  They also did a recall that I had forgotten about!  They treated me like a king!  I felt the same way on oil changes... NOBODY can say they didn't do a good job.  They are GREAT!

Sooo... I'm a happy camper when it comes to the Audi A6 2.8.  After 21K miles, I can't imagine owning anything else.
