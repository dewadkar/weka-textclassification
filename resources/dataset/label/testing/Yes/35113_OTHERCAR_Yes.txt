            We needed a digital camera for construction site photos at work, so knowing I'm a gadget and camera freak, they assigned me to be the buyer of a digital camera.  I found the C-211 at a clearance sale for $135.00!  Here's my opinion:

<b> What You Get - Intro </b>

The Olympus C-211 comes with a large set of multi-lingual instruction manuals, and a quick start guide.  Well written, and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera makers are putting their manual on C.D. disks.  You of course get the C-211 camera, a neck strap and len�s cap, a USB cable for photo downloading, a video cable for viewing photos on a television, a pack of Polaroid 500 film, and an 8 meg Smart Media memory card (as you can guess, you�ll want to buy a larger card, as you�ll only get about 5 images on an 8 meg card at the camera�s fine setting).  A set of AA batteries and software C.D. top off the list of in the box goods.

<b> The Good </b>

In Olympus tradition, photo quality is very good, showing lots of detail and nice (if perhaps a bit subdued) colors.  With a top resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels (2 megapixel), you�ll be able to print excellent 5 x 7 photos, and some pretty nice 8 x 10 photos, too.  On my H.P. printer using photo paper, the photos were great, but using the self-serv lab printer at my local Walgreens, the photos were outstanding.  These self-serve printers can be found at Wal-mart, CVS, and Eckerd drug stores, too.

You can of course, set the camera for a lower 640 x 480 pixel size, and use these photos for email or web pages.  There are two �quality� settings at this lower size, and on screen even they look very nice, with lots of details, though they will not look very good via your printer.  You can however, use the C-211�s built-in Polaroid printer to print even these lower resolution photos with decent results, since the Polaroids are only 2 x 3 inches in size.  I found the Polaroid prints to be decent in quality � I�ve seen better from an inkjet printer of course, but they�re a bit better than prints from an actual Polaroid camera.  In the camera�s settings you can adjust the printed photos contrast and brightness, to some degree.  

Besides the two pixel sizes of photos, you can adjust quality settings as well.  Either standard quality (SQ) for web use, high quality (HQ) for everyday photos, super high quality (SHQ) for prints, and TIFF mode (no compression) for even more detailed larger prints.  Be aware that TIFF prints require tons of space on a memory card, so use sparingly, and only if you really want a good 8 x 10 print.

The lens is a 3 X optical zoom (good), with a digital zoom option, which I avoid as digital zooms always degrade an image�s quality.  The lens is threaded, so you can screw on 35.5mm sized filters, a BIG plus to me, since many digital cameras still do not have this ability without adding awkward adapters to the lens.  I recommend getting a cheap UV filter right off the bat, to protect the main lens.  Your lens cap will still clip on to the front of the filter.  35.5mm is a somewhat awkward size, but you can find them in limited supplies at Ritz Camera stores (only through special order at Wolf Camera, however).

The menu and control buttons are arranged nicely on the back of the camera, next to the color LCD display.  The zoom control is via a toggle type lever that surrounds the control buttons, easily reachable with your thumb.  The menu button scrolls you through the camera�s various settings, including setting up the camera for the 15 second �video� mode (352 pixels in size), photo quality modes, and more.  A larger �Print� button allows you to print the photo you�re viewing on the LCD screen via the built-in printer.  Push it, and poof� out pops a Polaroid that develops fully in about 5 minutes.


<b> The Bad </b>

The C-211 uses 4, AA sized batteries.  Anyone who has used digital cameras before though, knows that off-the-shelf alkaline batteries are eaten like candy by these things, and I found that alkalines have an extremely short life in the C-211.  Since there is no optical viewfinder on this camera, you must rely on the color LCD to be on at all times to compose your photos, and since the LCD is the largest battery draining part of a camera, this contributes to short battery life (15-20 shots, max).  Trying some rechargeable NiMh batteries, my results were a bit better.  Maybe 50 photos using the LCD, zoom,  and flash, on about one-fifth of the shots.  Note you can use a USB memory �Smart Media� card reader to download your photos into the computer instead of the camera�s USB cable, to conserve battery power.  

The LCD is as on most digital cameras, hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight.  There is a flap that opens above for daylight use, that improves visibility somewhat, but just be prepared to �squint� a bit in sunlight, when composing photos.  An anti-glare coating on the LCD�s glass would have helped.  

Size DOES matter when it comes to carrying about a digital camera all day, and here, the C-211 is a whopper.  Roughly 9 inches tall and thick to accommodate the printer, it�s big by any camera�s terms, and the included neck strap is definitely needed.  You will not carry this in one hand all day at the zoo.   I�m not sure I should list this as a �bad� thing, as again, there�s simply no way they could have included a printer without the camera being this size, but if you�re looking for a �carry-around� digital camera, this would be a liability.

<b> Extras </b>

The manual suggests that a 64 meg Smart Media card is the largest size card you can use for this camera, but I have a 128 meg card in ours, and it works fine.  With the camera set at 1600 x 1200 pixels, and �SHQ�, I can take roughly 90 photos with such a large card.  Cards are cheap now, so stock up so you don�t run out of pixel power.

<b> Finals </b>

In terms of digital image quality, I give the C-211 a large �thumbs up�.  The Polaroid prints I give a �decent� grade too in quality; they have muted colors and can be a bit grainy, but again, they�re better than standard Polaroid camera prints usually are.  In terms of size however, I have to say that I would recommend this camera more for �field use� by people in the construction field, police, fire, insurance, or real estate agents, as opposed to the casual snap shooter who wants to carry a camera to outings and gatherings.  For less money, you can still find an Olympus D-490, which is essentially the same camera minus the built-in printer, and is much smaller.

If you do need a printer-camera however, the C-211 is a good one to have.  Look for bargains, too!  Some stores are still trying to get $599 for this thing, and I have seen them on sale for as little as $135.00 (clearance) to $249.00 (occasional Office Max sales), so shop around, and happy snapping!
