            I have owned my '91 Accord for over five years now and have had only one major repair which was justified by the mileage of the car, I had to replace the front coil which could only be done by a dealer, that was $400. Other than that all I have done is changed the brakes. I bought the car for $7000 back in '95 with 120,000 mileage. I bought from a dealer, which I have never done before, but I found this dealer to be honest, they told me it was mostly highway mileage, and by looking at the interior of the car you could see that, you could also tell by the hood of the car, it had a quite a few rock chips that only would come from highway driving in my opinion. The car now stands at 184,000 miles and is still very strong, the engine isn't tired, nor does it show any signs breaking down. It does need an alignment now, but that is all. I have changed the oil faithfully over the past five years, and I expect to for the rest of the cars life. This car has never left me stranded. Honda also has one of the best resale markets in terms of cars, this is a very important aspect of the car, you will find that cars with higher resale values are treated better than others whos resale deteriorates quickly. This, as well as all Hondas, is the best car around!!
