            I purchased this product so I could start taking pictures that have meaning rather than just taking what I could get and being happy with them.  When I bought the camera the direction that came with it were clear, and told me exactly what I needed to know to get started.  This camera is great for people with kids.  How many times have you gone to take a picture of a child and they close their eyes or look the other way.  This camera has an option to delete and retake pictures when they are not what you wanted.  This saves on negative looking pictures that you get back from developing.  This is a great starter digital camera for people who are not very up to date on technology.  I choose this product because you get more for your money and clear pictures.  I have seen other very expensive digital cameras and they really do not have much more to offer besides a empty pocket book.  Polaroid offers great software for this camera also.  <br><br>
