            I have never been very good at taking film in to get it developed. There are probably a couple dozen 35mm rolls lying around the house that are begging to get printed.

With the Kodak DC200 I never have to take a roll of film in again. The LCD display allows the picture to be previewed after each picture is snapped. Deleting bad pictures is a quick 3 step procedure.

The quality of the pictures are superb. At the highest resolution, 14 pictures can be taken on a 4Mb compact flash card. At the lowest resolution, great for email and web pages, over 40 pictures can be stored on the same 4 Mb's.

Using a photo printer like the HP P1000 and Kodak photo paper, professional quality photos can be expected. The only draw-back to the DC200 is the lack of a zoom lens. This is an included feature on the camera models above this.

If you are looking for a digital camera that does not require a degree to operate the Kodak DC200 is the camera to purchase.<br><br>
