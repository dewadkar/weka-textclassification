            We bought our 1999 Chevy Malibu new in July 99.  We had studied cars for about 6-9 months before we bought.  My husband knows alot (a real lot) about cars.  We were looking for an affordable four-door with good gas mileage, comfortable seating, automatic engine.  We tend to stick with GM cars, but we also looked at Corolla's, Taurus's, and Neon's.  

The Corolla gets great gas mileage, and has a great reputation, but the inside area was too small.  We also didn't like the quality of the interior trim and seating.  We looked at the Taurus, which was pretty nice.  But the gas mileage wasn't as good, and I didn't care for the interior design (which they have since changed).  The Neon was much like the Corolla, too small and cheap.

We test drove the Malibu a bunch of times.  It had nice interior space, more roomy than the 1994 Pontiac Grand Am we were currently driving.  We have two small children, and the car seats fit nicely.  We decided to buy, and got a great deal at Quirk Chevy outside of Boston in MA (if you're within 100 miles of that place, check out their prices, it's worth the trip).

We now have 28K miles on it.  The only problem we've had is that the brake rotors wore unevenly.  This is a known problem with this car, and our dealership nearby fixed it under warranty.  Otherwise, the car is fabulous.  Rides great, gets an average 26 MPG with mixed driving, and is peppy enough.  I would definitely recommend the V6 engine.  Stay away from the 4 cylinder.  Chevy is much better known for its quality V6 motors.  In fact the new models only come with V6 engines.  We got the base model with A/C and power locks.  

Overall, it's a great inexpensive family car.  Would definitely buy again.  It doesn't have the splashy looks of say the Grand Am or Pontiac Grand Prix, but it is nice enough.
