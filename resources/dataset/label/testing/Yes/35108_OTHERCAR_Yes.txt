            I received the Olympus Camedia C-211 Zoom camera as a gift from my husband.  I have never owned a digital camera but I am a children's photographer for a private company so I thought how nice it would be to be able to take my own pictures and not have to have the hassle of film.  
My husband saw this camera advertised one night on HSN and watched the demo. He liked it so much he had heard when it was going to be on again and called me into the room.  He said Do you like this camera? After watching how easy it was to print pictures instantly and take pictures I thought this has to be what I was looking for. I was right.  
The camera arrived a few weeks later. It came in a great little box with the software to download the pictures with.
I opened up the box and took the camera out. It came with batteries for the first use.  
I read the manual that accompanied it (you get a manual in French, English, and Spanish) and then wanted to try out my new "toy".  The camera requires 4 AA batteries. (keep some on hand or buy a recharger because you will go through a lot of batteries).  I placed the batteries in the battery case as directed on the inside of the case. Then I proceeded to slide the battery case back into the camera. The slot for the batteries is located at the bottom of the camera on the right hand side. 
The next thing you want to do is remove the Smart Media card from the case and place is the slot located on the opposite side of the camera.  The camera comes with a 8MB smart media card which in the lowest setting allows you to get over 80 pictures and still in good quality.  In the highest setting you will get 5 pictures but I always take my pictures in the lowest setting which is SQ (640x480) and they are just as good as the ones taken in the highest setting.
The camera from HSN also came with some film to try it out for the first time which I thought was awesome.  So I read further in the manual.  
I removed the lenses cap from the front and then turned the circular dial that is located on the back of the camera at the top right to the camera.  (there are a few settings on the dial. The first is Camera for taking pictures, Off for just that, A play button with a rectangle around it for viewing pictures, a Print symbol for printing your digital pictures and a setup button for transferring pictures and changing the settings of your camera.)
Once the dial was turned to camera I was ready to go.  There are a lot of features with this camera but for basic photography you are set to go.  I'll get into the more of those features later.
Zoom Features: 
The button to take the picture is located on the front of the camera. Now If you want to bring the object closer to you or further away (I like close ups) there is another dial located below your LCD screen(it's black in the middle with four arrow like buttons that are black and then you have a circle like button with a lever. To bring the image closer to you you will need to hold the lever down to W and to move it further away just push the lever to T.  The camera has excellent zoom features allowing you to get the best close ups almost like you were at a professional studio.  
The optical zoom is up to 3x the magnification but in combination with the telephoto zoom you can go up to 6x the magnification. Once again allowing you to take great close ups of loved ones or even those objects for auctions on ebay or insurance purposes. 
To use this feature Turn your camera to the record mode which is to the camera picture on your dial and then go back to those silver buttons under the bottom of the LCD screen and press it one time. To cancel you telephoto just hit the button a second time. 

Red-Eye Reduction:
Now that I have told you how easy it is to take your first picture. Let me explain some more features of this camera. 
The camera has red eye reduction which means you won't get those glaring eyes as long as you have this feature on. This is the third silver/gray rectangular button on the camera. You also have an antiflash feature which I haven't gotten to work for me yet. (not saying that it doesn't work just that I haven't figured out how to use that one)
Printing Photos:
After taking my practice photos I wanted to print them out. So I loaded the polaroid 500 film into the camera and was ready to go.  To print pictures turn your dial to the print button and follow the prompts on the screen. With the arrows located near the zoom lever you can zoom in and crop your photos directly on the screen.
The photos that print are of good quality for a Polaroid camera but they are better when you print them on photo paper. 
Software and transferring photos:
The camera comes with Camedia Software to transfer your pictures via your computer. It also comes with a USB cable but it isn't very durable considering mine broke within the first year.  
Hook up your USB cable to your computer. Insert the software into your CD-Rom drive and follow the installation instructions. Once you have the software installed be sure your camera is turned to settings.  Then you double click your camedia icon located on your main desktop or in your programs files.  This will open up the program for you.  Click My Camera which is located at the left handside under your files and then the camera will connect to your computer. You choose the pictures you download and share with your friends and family.
Our family loves receiving these pictures. They take them from their email and have them printed. The print quality is outstanding.  I tried another digital camera before this one which didn't have the same quality this one has and the pictures that I printed were grainy not of this quality. 
I have also hooked this camera up to my VCR with the video cable that comes with it.  I recorded pictures for our family from our trip to the zoo even zoomed in and cropped the pictures directly on the screen.  
The ease of use of this camera is amazing. Even if you never use any of the "special" features you are definitely getting your money's worth. Think of what you spend in purchasing film, developing costs, etc.
Quicktime movies:
The camera also takes excellent quality Quicktime movies which you can play back on your quicktime player but there is no sound.  I have used this feature at Ballgames, taking my children playing outside, etc.
Conclusion:
In conclusion this camera is a great deal, The features are amazing.  The quality of the pictures are excellent and the ease of use is exceptional.  
If you are looking for a great first digital camera try this one you'll be glad you did.
