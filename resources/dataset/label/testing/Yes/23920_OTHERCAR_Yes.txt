            &quot;Piece of garbage&quot; is a rather bold statement. Especially if it's made with absolutely nothing to back that statement up. Let's consider, shall we, exactly what &quot;garbage&quot; implies. That would be something that is thrown away after being used. Something no longer useful for it's original intended purpose. Just because the Audi TT has leather seats like a baseball glove, it's an overall useless machine? I have to heartily disagree. True, the TT does share a lot of components with the new VW Beetle, i.e., the engine, some suspension and brake components, the same designer (VW and Audi are, afterall, the same company and why waste parts or design talent), the TT is, in it's own right, a very capable car and most likely should not be despised just because of the seats. Maybe certain choices for interior/exterior trim are not for everyone, like the baseball glove leather seats (which I personally not wild about), but others may find it the greatest thing since sliced bread. Just because one person doesn't like it, doesn't mean that everyone else should despise it also. 
With that aside, let's get down to brass tacks. The TT is a stylish, nimble little car. It's got a rare quality in today's cookie-cutter sedan world, namely a different shape, that makes it a constant head-turner on the roads. It's just as reliable and safe as the other current Audi products, the A4, A6 and A8, and it's price is competitive with other roadsters on the market from marques like Honda, Toyota, Porsche (sort of) and the like. 
In regard to it's safety, it is true that the factory determined that the TT could experience suspect handling characteristics at extremely high speeds (read that as over 120 mph), but this problem only happened in Europe and could never happen here, assuming, of course, that the speed limit (or common sense) is adhered to. Also, Audi has issued a recall to replace the suspension and install a small, trunk mounted spoiler on 2000 and early 2001 TT's to eliminate this problem. And furthermore, Audi has already incorporated these updates into the manufacture of the car to eliminate the need for future suspension modifications. So much for this being an unsafe car. 
True, the TT is a lot like the new Beetle, but big deal? What car maker today doesn't try to save money by sharing parts with other models? True the TT is not the cheapest little car in the world. Does that make a difference when you can afford it? Audis, as a whole, aren't cheap. Should the TT be a bargain-basement, entry level car for $15,000 dollars? It would be nice, but that is not reality, and considering that the market will tolerate a little car like this for $40,000, who's to say it's too expensive. 
Overall, I have to say that the TT is a great little car. A little underpowered with the 180 HP two-wheel drive version, but a major blast to drive in the 225 HP, Quattro all-wheel drive version. And always a head-turner. Plus, it's got one of the best warranties in the industry, I don't car what Kia or Hyundai say. Three years or 50,000 miles of having everything covered on the car, including all scheduled maintenance and anything else that can wear out, right down to brake pads and wiper blades, sounds like the icing on the proverbial cake to me. All you have to pay for is gas, insurance and tires. 
So, with all that going for the TT, &quot;garbage&quot; probably does not describe the TT. Peace.
