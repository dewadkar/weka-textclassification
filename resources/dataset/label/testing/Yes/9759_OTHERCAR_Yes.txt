            The <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> has become my best friend. My poor Miata ( Mazda ) is lonely in the barn. The <b>Rodeo</b> begs to be used and abused so I give it what it asks for!

I purchased the <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> because I need an all purpose vehicle to transport friends, family and equipment. It comfortably seats five adults and still has room in the back for their belongings. It also is a blessing when I must transport my five, count them, five cats to the vet. It is so much easier to take them in all at once than two at a time in my Miata.

The towing capacity of the <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> is 2500 pounds, so I installed a 1 1/4 inch receiver hitch to attach a game basket to carry my triathlon bike. I have it set up to carry two bikes and an ice chest with room still left in the back for luggage. I do have a roof rack, but have yet to use it. It will carry 200 pounds ( evenly distributed ), but I am only 5' 2&quot; SHORT and can't reach the rack easily. The back window/door combination is perfectly designed. With the rack and bikes attached, you can still get into the back thru the flip up window. With the rack still attached ( but the bikes removed ), you can open the door which swings from right to left. This design makes it so easy to retrieve items in the back of my <b>Rodeo</b>. The split rear bench allows you to carry longer things and still have a back seat passenger.

Performance wise, the <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> excels. The 3.2 liter V 6 with 205 horsepower gives you plenty of responsive power. It has great pickup and still gets me 22 mpg in combined highway/city driving. This is a little better than the average <b>Rodeo</b> because my <b>Rodeo</b> has the 5 speed manual transmission. Although my <b>Rodeo</b> has 2 wheel drive, with my BFG ALL TERRAIN TIRES it performs admirably in light off road duties. The Brakes stop the vehicle with confidence.

I have only had two maintenance problems with my <b>Rodeo</b>. There has been a loose knocking noise in the front passenger side of the vehicle that the dealer &quot;could not duplicate&quot;. It is annoying and I will have it checked again when I do an oil change. The other problem was wet carpet caused by a faulty AC part. This was fixed and the dealer removed and dried the carpet. Even with these two problems, I would never get rid of my <b>Rodeo</b>.

The <b>Isuzu Rodeo</b> is a great utility vehicle for an active lifestyle. It has good looks and great design features. The power windows, power door locks and power windows work flawlessly. The stereo unit sounds good for a factory unit and has a CD unit available. I highly recommend this vehicle to all. I believe the new models come with a 10 year/120,000 mile warranty. That makes the vehicle even better. The warranty tempts me to trade mine in on a new IRONMAN model. But with only 38,000 miles, it is still worth keeping.<br><br>
