                I purchased this product about a year ago through e-bay. At the time it appeared to be the best value available. I particularly like the small size and the availability of getting the pictures into my PC with the media card floppy disk attachment. It has been wonderful with no problems. A year later I am still pleased. There is great availability of the media card at good prices and there is also a handy media reader available for under $60.
   I suggest you get the 16K or 32K card and always have a spare. Skip an 8K- too little storage. Having 2 16s or a 32 should do most everyone fine. I installed the floppy adapter software on my laptop and 2 home computers and keep the disk in my briefcase for quick use. I have used it for business presentations from Guatemala to Chile to here in Arizona.
   Although I paid about $600 at the time, I bet you can get these for under $250 at Auction, or maybe new. It would be a good buy. My only negative is that like most other tech things, you really need to read the manual and practice a bit at first. For me, it was rather easy (not simple) but I hate to read the manuals. Also, I think the battery does not seem to last as long as I'd like. It has never caused a problem but I am very careful to make sure it has had a recent charge. I should probably buy an extra.
    This would be a good buy and a good camera for anyone thinking about digital photography.<br><br>
