            This camera is great for taking general snapshots at events and get togethers.  

It has many features and settings (low light, picture quality...) and a swivel lense to take those hard to get shots.

The color LCD is fantastic on the back, with all functions clearly marked and easy to get to.  

The only problem I have with this camera is the battery life.  You will need 4 new AA's every 60 pictures or so, which can get expensive. I recommend you get 8 rechargeable batteries with a charger.  

I am an avid photographer and use this camera to setup my shots so that I can take the "keepers" with my SLR.  I also use it for family gatherings, taking pictures for the web and letting other people use it when I am using my other camera.
