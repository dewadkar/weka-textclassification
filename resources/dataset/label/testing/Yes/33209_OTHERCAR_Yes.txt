            This is the car James Bond should be driving!  It has got everything needed.  The one problem is the pricing.  It is one of the most expensive road cars out there, but also one of the best.  It has to be the most luxuries cars I have ever drove in my life.  It comes fully equipet with drilled alloy petals,  a button to start the engine, and removable roof panels.  These panels are made of glass but do not fear they block 84% of the sun's harmful rays to protect you from solar radiation.  There is also two colored upholstery!  The wheels are also alloy.  The engin is intercooled,  6.75 litre and V8.  This is perfection on wheels!!  This car can go from 0-60mph in 6.1 seconds and 0-100mph in only 6.4 seconds! 
 It also has integral fog/driving lamps.  The alarm opperations are controlled by the drivers own prefrences!  The body is covered in a hard zinc shell to protect it from rusting and other nature factors!  There is a stone/chip protection on the wheel arch prior to painting.  There ia also a fully powered braking system with four channel electric anti-lock system!  There is also passenger and driver side airbags.  One feature I especially like is the dual side level air conditioning!  Enough with the facts though it is time to talk about my experience.  The car is extremely comfy If I wasn't driving I might have fell asleep even though it was noon!  The car is really quiet and is fully powered machine!  It can reach speeds of 155mph and it is a luxury car not a sports car!  This car turnewd the head of everyone on the road!  I felt like a God I recomend this car for anyone who can afford it,  wants to stand out,  or wants the best road car avalible!  Though it is very pricy.<br><br>
