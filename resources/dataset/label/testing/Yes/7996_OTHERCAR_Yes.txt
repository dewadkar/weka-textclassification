            I bought a 1993 County LWB from a dealer in Texas through EBAY.  The vehicle came to me on a 10 car transport surrounded by a Ferrari Mondial, Mercedes M320, and a Porsche.  So it was definitely in the proper company when it came to me.  This truck is a luxury SUV that spared no amenities.  I went up to the local Land Rover shop and looked at their newest model.  The 2000 Range Rover 4.6 lists for $78,000.  it has color tv's in the headrests! 

Some of the designing &quot;bad ideas&quot; I had to take care of on my rig was that those darn brits decided to paint the wheels the same colour as the body.  This is a bad idea and i had to have Land Rover powdercoat my wheels a nicer silver colour.  That made a big difference to me and the rig.  The other design flaw is a roof rack should be standard.  So I clicked to accessconnect.com and purchased a 50x60 roof rack and that made a nice difference.  Finally I bought a set of JPMFG safari lights and mounted them on my brushbar.  I believe these trucks when naked look a little silly.  If your going to have a Rangie it should have at minimum a Factory OEM brushbar, and the taillight guards.  The roof rack and safari light are personal preference.  

Off road these rigs are the best, depending on what you are comparing them to.  I do not think they will out perform a souped up Toyota Forerunner that has been heavily modified.  But they will out perform almost ALL stock trucks.  Their ramp index is very good.  the 92 is better but the 93 LWB is a 588.  Better than Jeep, Ford, Chevy, Isuzu, Honda, Hummer, Dodge, Nissan, Lexus, Toyota.  The ramp index is a formula that shows how much flexibility your truck has off road.  A good indicator of how much &quot;articulation&quot; the rig has.  the higher the number the more flexibility there is.  

It sucks the fuel down, but even though the manual requests 91 octane, it is not necessary at all. I put in the 89. It has a strong 4.2 litre V8, that can definitely get up and go.  The AC works great, my breaks are better than the Maserati that I had. The ride is very smooth and the rig is quiet.  very very good soundproofing. 

What else can I say, Buy One and you will not regret it!<br><br>
