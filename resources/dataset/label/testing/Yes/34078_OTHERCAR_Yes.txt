            This is my third digital camera and it blows away anything that I have looked at or worked with in the past.  I knew it was time to move up to a megapixel camera so I did quite a bit of homework before deciding on the Olympus 3040.

<b>Over one month later of almost daily use, I can happily state that I am thrilled with this camera.  </b>

<b>Clarity:</b> the photos I have taken are razor sharp and VERY difficult to tell from 35mm.  I print them out on my $129 HP 832C printer and have blown some of them up to 8x10.  I have given 6 pictures as gifts so far and the reaction every time has been "Wow! This is a great photo".  When I tell them it is a digital photo printed on my home computer it usually changes to disbelief.

<b>Connectivity:</b> this camera simply could not be easier to connect.  I keep the included cord attached to one of my USB ports on my computer.  When it is time to download, I plug the other end in the Olympus and turn it on to playback mode.  The computer instantly recognizes it as another harddrive.  I then go into Explorer ("Windows" key [next to "ALT"} and "E" at the same time. I then click and drag the photos/movies to the directory I want on my computer.

<b>Flexibility:</b> I am admittedly not a professional photographer.  I would border on a enthusiastic amateur. I knew a few things about f stops etc but only enough to get me in trouble.  Knowing as much (or as little) as I do, I recognize the wider range of options that this camera is capable.  There are settings and modes on here that you simply will not find with most consumer aimed digital cameras.


<b>THINGS I'VE LEARNED</B>
1) Shop around for the best price.  I used pricescan.com and listed them out by price. Then I went to a few of the reputable sites and did my homework on shipping and handling.  The shipping charge part is important.  One dealer quoted a low ball price but then wanted to charge $44 for shipping!!  I ended up finding a place with free shipping with a low price of $649 total.

2) Buy extra memory.  For very good quality shots use the HQ mode.  You will get about 20 shots on the included 16MB card.  I went on Ebay and bought a 64MB card for $42 which is excellent considering they sell for $160!  I can now take 80 shots on this 16MB card and/or 2.5 minutes of movies.

3) IMPORTANT: If you have a CD-RW (a recordable CD-rom) DO NOT download from the camera directly to it!  You can safely download from the camera to your computer AND THEN transfer those files to the CD-RW.  The reason is that the CD-RW buffers files as it writes and there appears to be a conflict with downloading through USB and writing to the disk at the same time.  I learned this the hard way when about 200 photos were lost because the CD-RW disk had some sort of format error while writing to it.  This is not a problem with the camera, it is a technical limitation to the writing capabilities of the CD-RW.

4) I found an excellent site called shortcourses.com that offers a book and CD specifically for the Olympus 3040.  I have absolutely no affiliation with them other than having ordered this one item.  It is not a manual to teach you the mechanics of the camera. Instead it goes over the various topics of taking many different types of photos and tells you how to obtain the effects with the Olympus.  I learned quite a bit from it.

If you can afford it, you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
