            After my Mustang GT was totaled by a seventeen year old that "saw me but thought she could make it across" a divided highway  (50 miles an hour and I never hit the brakes)  I needed a new car.  The Mustang was fun, but I am 5'10, and the seats were it wasn't meant for anyone over 5'8.  In addition to the height issue, the seats were just flat out uncomfortable. (and after owning a Mustang and an SS I do not know what I was thinking when I bought the Mustang)  The SS is for those of us that enjoy a real sports car.  Mustangs are for people who like a sporty looking car.  There is a huge difference!
 
I sat in the SS and immediately liked the interior room, leather seats and Monsoon audio system.  The view of the stars out the t-tops and I was in love.  T-tops are great because it's like a convertible but not nearly as windy and without the exorbitant insurance rates.  (Less wind is good, when your hair is really long) All this before I ever cranked the engine...   Though I will admit, when I started it up, the murmur of the engine was all I needed.  It corners well, it's powerful and having the all aluminum  LS-1 V-8 engine, it will outrun or intimidate most everything you run across. Though I have noticed, it does tend to irritate the Corvette drivers that they paid 12- 20K more for theirs and they can't outrun you!
