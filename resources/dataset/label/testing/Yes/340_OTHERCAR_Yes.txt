            The Nissan Xterra was recently voted moter trend suv of the year.  There has to be some good reasons for that!
I test drove this vehicle, and came away impressed. At the time of my drive, I was looking for an SUV mainly because I wanted something that had 4 wheel drive, wasn't a &quot;truck&quot;, and was bigger than a car.  That basically left me with an SUV.  

The first thing I noticed about the truck was the tubular roof rack on the top. It really adds a sporty look to the truck.  Nissan needed to mask the otherwise awkward hump at the top of the roof where the rear passengers would be sitting. Another thing was that the rear passengers  sit in stadium seating style because they are sitting on top of the gas tank.And who can forget/not notice that other hump on the back of the truck?  That's for a first-aid kit. What else? Just what you needed, right? It's a gimmick, in my opinion, but gimmicks sell: All in all, though- I think the bump adds to the brawny look and I admire Nissan for their ingenuity.
The Xterra is built on the Frontier pick-up frame- all Nissan did was add a rear cabin. The Xterra shares a lot of characteristics with the Nissan Frontier pick-up, engine, gas tank, dash, suspension, and wheel size- all identical.  If your thinking that they didn't put much thought into the design because its a lot like the Nissan Frontier, hear these facts: Ford Expedition, built on the F-150 frame.  Chevy Blazer, built on an S-series frame... and so on and so on.  This isn't a new thing for Automobile Designers.  Overall, I really like the look of the Xterra. It's easy to see why this has become so popular in a market where looks mean a lot.


You won't see a hint of luxury in any Xterra interiors. That is the way Nissan intended it. The way a REAL SUV was supposed to be! The seats give pretty good support, but it does however, feel like you are sitting ON them after a few hrs. The driver sits high. Five people fit easily, although those in the back do rub hips a little bit. The 6-speaker stereo gives decent bass response. The controls are well laid out, and the air conditioner is powerful.  One thing to watch out for tho is the popup sunroof?  It is designed so, that you need to take out the platic basket on the top before opening the window...which could be a real pain if you have need for the basket, but want the window open..

The Xterra is slow to gain speed, and the V6 should be larger for a vehicle this size. Once you are cruising, however, the Xterra performs pretty well. Passing is relatively drama-free. Its V6 is shared by the Frontier pickup and the Pathfinder. It dishes out 170HP and 200lb-ft torque. As for gas mileage, expect a less-than-adequate 16/19 MPG city/hwy.
It has a rather quiet ride, but excedding 65 mph you can really start to hear the wind hit the tall frame.  It rides like a truck, but is better than most!

Once again, this is a truck, no two ways about it. If you make a sharp turn, you will feel it. There is no excessive body roll, however. Braking is good and controlled, although the body nosedives during the process.  
 
In the short time I took it off-road, the suspension soaked up bumps and large rocks very nicely. The cabin was quiet and rattle-free. Be warned, however, that the spare tire is located UNDER the vehicle. This is not the placement of choice for real 4WD vehicles. However, most people will not be taking these rigs off-road, and in the event of a rear collision, NOT having the spare tire mounted on the back can save you a lot of money in damages. 

Look at the consumer base- those looking at the Xterra are probably looking at other SUV's equal in size. The Xterra, being cheaper than most will stack up very well, in my opinion. As an added plus, Nissan usually makes solid products. For now, however, I feel other SUV's may be a better value, and would wait until prices come down on the Xterra. Still, I feel this no-nonsense SUV deserves your attention.
