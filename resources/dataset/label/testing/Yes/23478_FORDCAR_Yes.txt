            The Ford Taurus was redesigned for the year 2000, and this redesign is a huge improvement over the bubble look of the older model. That redesign lost the &quot;Best Selling Car in America&quot; title for Ford. It is Ford's hope that this car will put Ford back on top. The styling is similar, but looks much better, and more conservative. While this car isn't perfect, it is cheaper than its import counterparts. 

The Taurus excels at safety. Ford must have consulted their Volvo division to make this car so safe. It got five stars in crash tests, and definitely puts safety first. The front airbags sense the weight of the passenger, and deploy at certain forces for certain weights. The gas/brake pedals move, and there is a interior trunk release- in case kids think it is a good place to play.

Overall, this car is a great, inexpensive car for any family that wants to get their safely.<br><br>
