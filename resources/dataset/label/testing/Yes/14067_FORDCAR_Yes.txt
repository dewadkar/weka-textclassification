            When my 1998 Plymouth Neon started giving me hard times, it was time to think about what other car I would want to drive.

Since the BMW 330Ci coupe was way out of my price range, and the celica and eclipse both were cute, but so was the neon, and i wanted a change from cute to hot.

The mustang had been on my list of cars to ogle for quite some time so I thought, why not?  

I checked out the prices of the 2001's and 2002's and found them to be practically the same, so I went with the 2002, since I was in not so much of a rush and figured at least I could order it custom.  

Mustang offers an array of cool colors, but after considering the light Silver, black, and true blue, i chose True Blue.  

I then had to choose which model I wanted, I really wanted the power of the GT and since I was buying this car all on my own, I decided to treat myself even though it would boost the price somewhat.  

Next I had to choose the package, and I figured since I was already splurging for the GT I might as well go for the best package which is the premium.  This includes the power group (mirrors, driver seat, windows), tilt stearing, cruise control, rear spoiler, leather interior, mach 460 sound system (with option to get mach 1000), fog lamps, traction control, ABS, and a special set of alloy rims.  

Once it was ordered, had to wait for it, it was agonizing after a while, and Universal Ford (dealership in Queens, NY), didnt make the wait any easier, with their giving me the run around about delivery dates at every opportunity, but finally, the day came for delivery, and I was in love!

I sat in it and turned on the engine, boy did that pony sound like music to the ears.  I couldn't wait to drive it home. 

The ride was smooth, great handling, and the power it has is phenominal.  I am very comfortable sitting in it, although anyone larger than me,a 21 year old girl, would be quite uncomfy at first, even an average sized male felt awkward at first, but admitted it was worth getting used to because the drive is so fun.

The sound system, I have mach 460, is unlike anything I have ever heard in a car that hasn't been modified at all. it has in dash 6 cd changer and am/fm.  It has DSP effects with News, Jazz Club, Stadium, Church, and a few others as effects that can modify the music, which is fun to play with, but admittedly not very useful otherwise.  

Overall though, this is a great car, fun to drive, pretty to look at, and really cool to catch passerbys admiring! (:
I'm glad I chose the mustang gt.
