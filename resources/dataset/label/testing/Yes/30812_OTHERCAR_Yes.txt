            I spent about 3 months choosing the brand of camera after another 3 months prior to my purchase looking at quality of digital camera images, color, and all the other aspects about the camera.  Although the primary weighing factor was price, I did not want to waste my money, so the goal was to get as much as I could for as little as I could.  My choice was the Olympus 340-R camera.  The image quality is superior at 1280x960 (1.3Mega pixel) with very good color pickup.  I have tested the camera in a variety of scenes, catching splashes (with a little blur) and other motion.  The performance during action shots was better than I expected for a low priced camera. I have tested most of the features, with good results with the exception of one feature I have not tried and one that I dislike.  I still have not tried the panoramic mode, though I am planning to this summer.  Since it requires a tripod to make the motion smooth, I have not jumped at the idea YET.  The one feature I HATE is the digital zoom.  Don't bother with it.  If you are looking for quality images as I am, I NEVER use any storage other than SHQ and the digital zoom automatically switches to SQ.  I have since learned to center the image and crop it using the software provided.  This will give you the equivalent of a digital zoom at higher quality and just a tad more effort.
The macro, I must confess, is one of the most used features.  I have captured butterflies, bees, flowers and almost anything I can get close to.  All in all I am very pleased with my purchase and would not change it in the least!
Although it is nothing against this particular camera, there is one thing about digital cameras in general that a purchaser should be aware of.  The digital image goes through an automatic histogram equalization based on the amount of light picked up.  There are, of course, limits to what this can do, that is what the flash is for.  But it allows you to get a bit spoiled and turn off the flash in medium light conditions and still get superior images.  However, there is a downside.  I used to photograph sunsets with my 35 mm camera and I cannot do that with the digital camera. When viewing the sun directly the image is quickly darkened to make up for the abundance of light.  Even the slightest hint of a sun will fade the foreground to almost nothing.  Some of the color is also lost.  I do not consider this a problem, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and I have just started carrying my 35mm camera along for the few times I want to take pictures of sunsets and sunrises.<br><br>
