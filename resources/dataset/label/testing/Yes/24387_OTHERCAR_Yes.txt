            I'm from the Dallas/Ft Worth area.  I have a Kia Sportage EX 4 Door 4X4.  I love it!!!  I've always wanted a SUV, but couldn't afford one, until the Kia Sportage.  It's a great family car, not too big, not too small.  My family and I travel a lot, and it's great on the road, comfortable and gets decent gas mileage.  It does need more horsepower, you're not going win any race with this vehicle, but that's the only thing so far that I would change.  This is a good vehicle for anyone, young or old.  I do notice a lot of heads turning, and get lots of compliments as it is a great looking vehicle.
