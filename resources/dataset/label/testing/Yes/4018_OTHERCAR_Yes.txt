            My husband had an old, beat-up Toyota pick-up that he hated to get rid of because it was paid for.  It had about 250,000 miles on it and it was time for a final rest.  He searched for about four months for a new truck to take it's place.  I think he must had test drove about every kind of truck on the market.

He finally made up his mind in October of 1997.  He test drove a 1997 Isuzu Hombre space cab pick-up and fell in love with it.  He was impressed with how much room the space-cab part had.  The truck is not too big and it is not too small.  It also gets good gas mileage.

He picked out a silver-gray one and brought it home that same night.  He still has his truck and plans on keeping it until it is time for it's final rest.  I hope this truck gives him as much joy as his other one did.
I feel that it will, because he is still satisfied with it.
