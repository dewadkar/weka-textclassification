            All I can say is wow. The 1999 model is what my mother drives, she lets me borrow it when my jeep is in the shop. It has great pickup, rides extremely comfortable, and has gas mileage for a king. It comes equipped with a v6 engine. The new 2000 model comes with two new colors and some new safety features.  The 2000 GS 4 Dr Sedan gets 24/35 miles to the gallon and the LS 4 Dr Sedan gets 19/28 miles to the gallon. The GS is a four cylinder with a horsepower of 125 and the LS is a six cylinder with a horsepower of 170. These are really nice cars, well worth the money. I recommend this car to anyone.
