            The 928 is a luxury performance coupe. Pretty vague, right? Well, let me elaborate. Luxury means that sitting position is very comfortable, soft, but firm sport seats. Plenty elbow and leg room, good visibility, and great support. I love the instrument cluster and overall interior practicality. I have yet to see a more original body on any current production car. 

In fact, if you take a close look at some of today's performance machines, much has been borrowed from the 928. A stock 928 powerplant in good tune provides enough power to embarass most of current import and domestic V8 sports cars. Keep in mind that performance testing 10 or 13 years ago was done with the technology available at that time. Tires, lubricants, plugs, etc. 0-60 in 5.5 or 5.7 is not bad, but I've done better.

 Handling may not be the most precise, but it more than makes up in balance and predictability. This 3600lb cruiser is awesome stable at high speeds. I'm partial to the 5spd because it gives a sporty feeling when driving and are a lot more difficult to find. If you're looking for something unique and a great head turner, this may be it.<br><br>
