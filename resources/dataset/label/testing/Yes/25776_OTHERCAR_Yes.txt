            I bought my '93 Nissan Altima as a dealer demo with a couple thousand miles on it.  I have put over 100K miles on it with very few problems.  I can safely say that this is the most reliable vehicle I have ever had.  I would recommend this car for people who are going to be doing a great deal of travelling and driving.  Being very comfortable, it would make for a great family car.  It also has child-proof doors and window in the back seat.  I have had some electrical problems, but I believe this has been due to tampering and not regular wear and tear.  The only real con I have regarding the car is it's fairly bland appearance.  It's not really what one would call &quot;striking&quot;.<br><br>
