            Mercedes C-Class, 2002

When C-Class = A-Class. 

The new Mercedes C-Class has distanced itself from all competition and they have done it with a lot of room to spare. 

The only place where any competitor may have a chance is with the price, as with any Mercedes products if you want to ride in one you are going to pay a premium.

In 1993 the C-Class appeared on the dealers floor replacing the 190 that had already been around for ten very good years. So today seven years after Mercedes has rejuvenated it, by giving it a slicker look that resemble the very popular
S-Class.

Mercedes has elongated and widened the body, thus giving the driver and the passengers more room and I also noticed that the trunk space is also much bigger since the new design arrived on the market.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Having owned various model Mercedes it is always a pleasure to take place behind the wheel of a new or redesigned model. It allows me to compare the new model with some of the ones I either owned or rented before.

I do like the new C-Class; Mercedes has loaded it with some of the high tech innovations that you could only find on the more expensive S-Class. 

A few example would be; an electronic anti-skid system, side air-bag to protect the driver and passenger, the exterior side-view mirrors have an anti-glare coating and plus many more improvement borrowed from its big sister.

Also available are a series of new options; heated front seats, a factory installed anti-theft system, a sun-roof or folding rear seats to name but a few.

The catch is that as always Mercedes options are overpriced.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The interior of the C-Class is a piece of art, Mercedes only use top quality material and the workmanship is top-notch.

The drivers front seat can be adjusted to an impressive variety of positions, add to this the fact that the steering column is inclinable and telescopic, allows the driver to find a comfortable position to drive no matter its body type.

All the gauges and controls are easy to see reach, but the sound system could be better as far as I am concern.

If there is one thing I did not care for in the interior of the C-Class, it is that if you sit two adults of average size in the rear seat they will be a bit tight.

The exterior:

The newly redesigned C-class Mercedes also comes with a new exterior look that resemble the S-class, gone are the square head and rear lights replaced by the slicker looking headlights and the triangular rear lights mounted on the rear fenders.

All these drastic changes have given the C-class a less severe look and a body that looks less like a cereal box. 

As I mentioned previously Mercedes has elongated and widen this model giving it more panache.

The new exterior is much more aerodynamic and also more modern looking.

THE ROAD TEST

Aided by a quantity of electronic equipment the C-class is a dream to drive whether on the highway or within the city limits. Now any one looking for high performance maybe a bit disappointed this is not a car to bring to the racetrack
unless you go as a spectator.

On the highway the car handles like a dream, the front seat comfort is almost unbeatable on the rear seat you may feel a bit tight on long drives.

In city driving with the C=class you will have excellent all around vision and the car is easy to maneuver.
