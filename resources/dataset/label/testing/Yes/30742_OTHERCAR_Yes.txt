            When I buy electronics, I want a model that's widely accepted to be a dependable workhorse, that's broadly compatible, and that delivers real quality -- the kind of quality that would fool anyone but a pro into thinking that I spent thousands of dollars. And I want a bargain on it.

The Olympus D-340R has developed almost a cultlike following as being this kind of bargain. 

95% of the consumer market for digital cameras is looking for that kind of sharp, excellent quality to record their vacations, try their hand at digital artistic expression, or create good images for their Websites or some kind of professional cataloguing.

This camera can handle all of these with ease, and for an extremely reasonable price. Though the D340R page on epionions lists the price at $700, the camera actually sells for around $300 now. Why so cheap? Because it's been around a year or two. Perhaps the manufacturers forgot to build in obsolescence. The camera is a standard.

I bought a D340R when my company realized we'd need a digital camera to record our company's early days as well as take photos for our website. We've given it a lot of use, and it rarely disappoints. Here are some details:

-- design of the unit: excellent. takes perhaps 10-20 minutes to learn its main features and how to access them. has a screen on the back that can be used to review photos that are in memory, as well as to leave on, 'live,' during photography so you can see the live image you are about to take, if you prefer that to the optical viewfinder.

-- transferring images to computer, etc: comes with a serial cable for connection to a windows or macintosh machine. comes with two main pieces of software: CAMEDIA, which facilitates downloading the images to your computer as straight JPEGs, and Adobe PhotoDeluxe, which is the scaled-down, home-market version of Photoshop that ships with a large number of digital cameras. A full 1280x960 image takes about 10-20 seconds to transfer through the serial cable into your computer. 

-- simply put, the photos that come through are generally excellent. However, realize that it is up to you to learn the skills of processing the images (using photodeluxe, or, better, photoshop) once you've got them into your computer to make them truly good -- to brighten them up (digital technology is truly amazing at this), edit them, crop and adjust color, fix red-eye, etc.

I will list the slightly negative aspects of the camera here, but realize that the end evaluation is excellent:

-- no zoom. if zoom is truly central to what you need, get a different camera.

-- the built-in flash is just passable. I've found that I have to tell subjects to stay away from nearby walls when doing portraits (this is something that any photographer will have to do) to avoid a large nasty shadow next to the person. Also, red-eye happens on occasion, which you can repair once you have the image in your computer, or tell your subjects to look at a light bulb before shooting them.

-- the battery life (four AA's by the way) is not tremendous. spent the extra $15 to get four rechargables and a charger. it will improve your whole experience.

overall, a true bargain for a high-quality consumer camera.<br><br>
