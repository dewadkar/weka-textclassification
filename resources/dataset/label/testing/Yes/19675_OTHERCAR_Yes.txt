            I must say that Saturn has improved their cars over the years.  I come from a long family of Saturn Cult Members...er... I mean Saturn Owner (rule #1 Never talk about Saturn Cult).  One vast improvement I noticed between my brother's SL ('95) and my SL ('99) was strategic placement of the ashtrays.  In brother's SL there is an ashtray for passengers in the back seat.  Considering that it is a family car I really don't understand the reason for ashtray's in the back-seat (&quot;Mommy, Timmy is not sharing his cigarettes again.&quot;).  My new car did not have that option.
My SL is really great on gas mileage I could make it from Albuquerque to Phoenix on one tank of gases.  I am very curious as to why you still see the word SELF at the gas stations.  I can't remember the last time I drove to a gas station and sat there for hours waiting for the attendant.
Another feature one my Saturn was the new and improved quieter engine. Now when I am driving down the road, I can curse at other drivers without the fear of the engine drowning out the sound of my voice.  Of course downside to that is I have to paint over the bullet holes if the other drivers do hear me cursing at them.
If you do not own a Saturn yet, not to worry you will be assimilated one day.  Resistance is futile.<br><br>
