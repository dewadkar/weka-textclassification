            The 2001 Honda civic LX coupe is my first new car and so far I have no regrets whatsoever! It is a quite ride, Handles well, Looks great, spacey interior, the list goes on and on. I opted for the LX instead of the EX only because of the cost difference. The LX suits my needs just fine with power everything and even cruise control. Driver and passenger side airbags. (Although I've seen and know someone online that was in a crash at 35 mph and the airbags did not deploy, something to consider!) It also sports a theft deterrent key with a chip inside it that matches a chip in your ignition. Basically don't lose your keys! Have to go to the dealer for another one. The only thing I wish the LX had is Anti lock brakes, but I guess You can use the "poor mans" method if needed. This car is also GREAT on gas, seems like forever between refills! This car is very stylish with great options for it's price range, I don't think you could get a better car for your money end of story.
