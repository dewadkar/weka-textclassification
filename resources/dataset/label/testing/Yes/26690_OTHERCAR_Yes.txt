            I�ve wanted to enter the digital camera world for a very long time, but for far too long they were far too expensive.  I�ve been waiting for the prices for at least a one maga-pixel cameral to come down to an affordable price.   Over the last few months, I noticed that digital cameras have come down to a price that I was willing to pay and they offered the features I was looking for.  

<b>What I wanted</b>

I wanted at least a one mega-pixel camera; I knew that I would be limited in the size picture I could create from the files.  They say that a three mega-pixel camera is equal to a 35mm camera, but they are far too expensive for me right now.  A one mega-pixel camera would allow 4x6 photos and that was good enough for me at this point.

I started looking at the cameras in the $300 range and narrowed things down to two choices.   I decided that it was either going to be a Kodak DC-215 or an Olympus D-360L.  The Kodak has a 2x optical zoom and uses Compact Flash.  The Olympus did not have an optical zoom but it did have auto focus.  The Olympus also had some more advanced features that were not available on the Kodak, such as exposure settings, spot metering, and ISO settings.  

<b>My choice</b>

After reading all the information I could, I finally decided on the Olympus, it seemed a little more advanced than the Kodak.  Although, it didn�t have an optical zoom, I was less concerned about this.  I have an SLR with a couple of zoom lenses and I would use those if the situation required it.  The camera uses Smartmedia cards, which are more limited than the Compact Flash cards.  This didn�t concern me as much either.  I was buying this camera as an entry-level digital camera.  The limitations of Smartmedia, such as smaller maximum memory size, did not mean as much with a one-mega pixel camera, to me at least.

<b>The camera</b>

The camera has a very nice feel to it, well balanced and high quality.  The control are very simple to use and can be learned very quickly.  There are five buttons on top and three on the back next to the LCD screen.  The four five on top control functions on the camera, such as the menu to make choices, deleting pictures, macro mode, flash control, etc.  The three on the back control the LCD screen.

Opening the front cover turns on the camera.  When I first bought this, it was literally 2 minutes before I took my first picture.  It is point and shoot simple, but it allows some control over the pictures.  If all you are looking for is a simple camera to take nice pictures, this is a good choice.

I had heard some complaints about fast battery usage and I disagree.  The speed at which you will use up the batteries is directly related to how much you use the flash and the LCD screen.  By limiting how much you use the LCD, you can get well over 100 pictures from a set of 4 AA batteries.  I was fortunate because my camera came with a set of NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger.  I would have bought these anyway, so I saved some money here.

There is a nice feature called the Panorama mode.  When you are in this mode, the screen shows bars on either side of the view.  You take a picture and then move your camera so that the end of your first picture overlaps the end of your second picture.  You can take up to 10 pictures in this mode.  When you download the pictures to your PC, using the included software, you can stitch the pictures together into a panoramic print.  It is important to note that you have to use an Olympus Smartmedia card to use the Panorama feature.

Here is an example of how the panorama pictures turn out.  I didn�t try anything special here; I was just testing out this feature.  This is a rather large file, so if you check it out, keep that in mind:

Speaking of downloading, when you download from the camera, it takes a long time.  It is a very slow process.  My next purchase will be a USB card reader for faster downloading.  

The included 8 meg card is large enough to hold 36 pictures at the medium quality.  This is the quality that I normally use.  My second purchase after the USB card reader will be a 16-meg card.  This will be large enough to hold an adequate number of photos under normal circumstances.

<b>Conclusion</b>

I highly recommend this camera.  For a lower end camera, it can�t be beat.  Other than the lack of zoom, which I would like, but do not find necessary, this camera has everything I need in a point and shoot digital camera.  This is defiantly one that you should research before buying  anything else in its class.
