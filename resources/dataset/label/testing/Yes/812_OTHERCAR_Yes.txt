                I test drove a 1990 XJS with a 5.3 liter V-12.  The saleslady said $3.00 in gas would be plenty, being that the needle was on empty.  Hence, you now understand my title.  I purchased the car that day, despite any humiliation I may have felt about running it out of gas (at rush hour).  Now, five years later, I am prepared to arm you with the knowledge that I myself lacked at the time of purchase.
    Elegance comes standard from the factory, and this cars sleek, 'long' appearance draws many admiring glances from other motorists.  Those with longing in their eyes are wishing...  current or former owners are pitying you.  The ride quality is superb, and handling is predictable.  Even driving at highway speeds, while you 'allow' others to pass you and gawk, the ride is exceptionally silent.  However, the wind and engine noise at speeds above 140, combine to create a terrifying song.  This car is also heavy (over 2-tons), and launches from the stoplight are not record-setting.  Besides, it seems almost undignified and disrespectful to mash your foot down on the gas.
    The dark side...  Most know it already, but these cars were not the most reliable.  Expect oil leaks, air conditioning leaks, and water leaks.  Also expect the climate control system to heat in the summer, and cool in the winter.  Budget your finances to allow for regular maintenance trips to your dealer, when you get a card in the mail announcing 'time for scheduled maintenance', stick to it.  Expect the dealer to charge 2-3 times what a quart of oil costs, etc.   
     This car was not designed for family cruising,  I was single when I bought mine, and now it just sits in the garage.  But will I get rid of it?  Never.  Why? you ask?  I'll tell you... 
     As the world's oil supplies diminish and EPA restrictions increase, cars and their engines will continue to get smaller.  Jaguar no longer produces the V-12 engine, and most likely never will again. Own a little piece of automotive history while you still can. It is a relic already, fast slipping into the chasm of time that our children and grandchildren will call 'old times', and what we ourselves might think of as 'the good old days'.         <br><br>
