            I purchased a new Camry in 1998. I was looking for a new set of wheels and because I drive 25,000 miles a year, I wanted something reliable, low cost to operate and comfortable. The Camry fit the bill. 

The model I purchased had the power options, AC, V6, automatic, etc. 

I drove it for 4 years and put 100,000 miles on it... estimated at 80% highway, 20% city driving... good roads, very little congested traffic.  

My take on it was that it was a good car... good fit, lots of passing power, comfortable for the driver and passenger. (not great in the rear seat however) 

My con's however are that the suspension was not great and in fact I was shocked that my rear struts blew out at 60,000 miles. 

Toyota (I have owned 7 Toyotas) continues to fail in the suspension category and in this case, it was extremely bad. 

That being said, would I recommend the Camry... if you are looking for reliable, reasonably priced, well built... yes...
