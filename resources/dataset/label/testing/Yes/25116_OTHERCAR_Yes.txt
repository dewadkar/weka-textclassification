            The Mitsubishi Montero when compared to the Tahoe, Suburban or Expedition has less interior room but when comparing style and features it leaves the others on the side of the road in a snow bank.
This vehicle is made to turn heads and hearts and make loyal buyers of those who own them. That is a strong statement coming from a Chevy Salesman, but whose wife works for a Mitsubishi dealer. We started with the Montero Sport but found the headroom from the low roof line to be more of a hassle than help. But, stepping into the interior of the Montero is like stepping into your living room. The roof line is high and the headroom great. I particularly like the large sunroof that sits in the middle of the vehicle. A roof made for photographers to stand in and take photos of wild animals. Being in the middle of the vehicle there is no danger of the sun beating down on top of your head or in your eyes. 
The leather heated seats are nice in a cold climate as well as the heated rearview mirrors. 
Steering is easy and responsive. The 4Wheel disc anti-lock brakes really help in those panic situations. This vehicle is criticized for its 6 cyl. motor (200hp.)in an over 4,000 lb. vehicle but I have found it to be more than sufficient. 
Every where I drive people stare. The outside skin is well designed, fresh looking and does not look like all its competition. The chrome rear bumper and tail lights give it a look of distinction.
I am very pleased with the Montero and wonder why I had not purchased one sooner.
