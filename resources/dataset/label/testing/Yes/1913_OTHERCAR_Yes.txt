            I admit it: I am a Maxima addict.  I recently traded my '97 SE Max for a 2000 SE model.  What was good has become even better.  If you want a practical sedan that is simply a kick to drive, this is it.   

The overall redesign is simple and elegant.  Although I'm not thrilled with the tail-light design, I'll get used to it.  The rear spoiler is smaller too, and looking straight-on from the back it just looks odd, compared to prior models.  The view from the front, however, is awesome!

The cabin is quieter, the ride is smoother, the brakes feel stronger, and the automatic transmission has lost that annoying &quot;clunky&quot; feel.  In day-to-day use, it's hard to detect the extra 25 horsepower under the hood, but it still has the great pickup that has always characterized the Maxima.

The &quot;one-touch&quot; controls on the sun-roof and drivers window-up are long overdue.  No more annoying holding the switches.  Nissan had the driver in mind with other simple touches, such as moving all of the cruise controls to the steering wheel, adding an overhead sunglass pocket and an adjustable middle armrest.  

About the only thing I don't like about this car is the way the trunk lifters still descend into the cargo bay as I close the trunk, potentially crushing anything in their path.  I guess the only alternative would be pistons which eventually wear out, so I can accept this limitation.  The trunk space is actually a bit larger, so this may not be as much an issue anymore.  I suppose I'll find out during the upcoming Christmas shopping season.

All in all, I highly recommend this fine vehicle as an exceptional value at a reasonable price.
