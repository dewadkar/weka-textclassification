            The Chrysler 300M comes into the fold as Motor Trend car of the year in 1999. This fact, and others helped make my decision to buy this car.  While this car is part of the LH platform of Chrysler full sized sedans that include Intrepid,Concorde, the 300M has much more Euro-Sport feel than its less premium stable mates. 

Its firmer suspension, especially in comparison to the Concorde, and higher specification 250 horsepower, and 250 pound feet of torque 3.5 liter V-6 engine  help move this 3300 plus pound automobile quickly, and smartly when called to do so.
Relatively fast acting Rack and Pinion steering help with the cornering chores, and have good on center feel, and  good weighting. The standard 17" Michelin MX series tires have reasonable stick. The Traction Control which helps reduce wheel spin on slippery surfaces work with the ABS braking system. The Traction Control is defeatable by a push of a button. 

The 300M is about delivering a sporty driving experience and for the most part it delivers. Understeer and some front end plow occur at higher than most persons would push the M. Braking is short and positive, but I have concerns with brake fade with repeated hard braking. Please note that this M does not have the Performance Handling Package which includes the better brakes, and faster steering ratio, and stiffer suspension components . I drove the "PHP" car, and it just rode too harsh for my long distance drives my M would do. 

Acceleration is more brisk while using the manual mode "Autostick" transmission, but when used it can at times be harsh, though improves responsiveness. In standard Automatic mode, shifts are smooth but slow and kick down when flooring the accelerator could be quicker.

Pending modifications for improved performance of my M will be Ceramic composite brake pads, cross drilled and slotted disc brakes, and Michelin Pilot tires with perhaps 18" wheels. A K&N cold charger air intake maybe added to improve responsiveness. I have already installed Bosch plus 4 sparkplugs and a K&N air filter that helped responsiveness some.

Creature comforts are very good, but there are a few concerns. The heated seats while comfortable and well tailored in rich Leather, have seat heaters that will toast a bottom with too much heat even at the low setting. Lateral support could be better too, but the adjustable lumber support makes my back happy. 

HVAC and radio controls are fairly well laid out, but the radio could stand less confusion on some functions. I have the Cassette Deck option in this car, and the sound is fair to good. The single CD player will not play CD-RWs'. Fidelity of the audio system is a weakness in Chrysler cars, and the M is no exception. Poor resonance control the tweeter modules and ill defined midrange and bass response is inexcusable for a car like this. The remaining trip computer and temp/compass are a welcome addition to the standard features. 

The exquisite dashboard with the antique clock face like dials add to easy read and a sense of class, though incomplete. Where is the volt gauge and oil pressure gauge?
A car with such sporty intentions should keep its driver informed of all critical status modes. The wood accents are not going fool anyone that it is anything but well crafted plastic looking wood. The steering wheel has redundant vol/track select/cruise control, and stereo mode controls. The cruise control buttons are not illuminated. Very poor idea since cruise maybe used at night or day. Master electric window controls are not all backlit either.

Big car,big room. The trunk space is generous, and opening wide. The M features split fold down seats to improve utility too. Back seat room is generous for 2, less so for 3. Though not objectionably so. The bottom seat cushion could use more thigh support, but otherwise is a first class ride for the passengers. Rear passengers also benefit from a rear console AC vent to keep them cool.

All in all, the interior is a wonderful place to be, with the terrific aroma of leather, and the general comfort here, the M is very inviting indeed.

Reliability has been good, but niggling problems such as a moving front driver seat while doing hard braking/acceleration is not acceptable, and there is a buzzing coming from the drivers side B pillar. Dealer has not been able to fix either properly. A crank sensor that went out adjustment. Besides these concerns, the M is trouble free. 

My Vegas trips consistantly return 27 to 28 mpg average, and that is averaging 70-75 mph. Running the Air Conditioning reduces the mileage considerably. About 21-24 mpg on the Vegas runs with AC. So my assesment is fair/to good on mileage. Note this on regular 87 octane gas. Though 89 is recommended, 87 runs safely on the 300M too.

Service on the M has been an average to less than average experience. The M afterall is the top of line car before the Crossfire came out, and it is inexcusable for the poor service quality. 

Overall with the concerns taken into account, there is allot to recommended about the 300M, though with so much competition like the Altima 3.5 that is faster than the M, and the new Acura TL, and the wonderful Infiniti G35 sedan, the 300M is behind the curve. Even the Pontiac Grand Prix with the Comp G package will give a 300M a run for its' money. So while the 300M is discontinued now, it still represents Style,value and above all else, competent performance without the expensive upkeep that the expensive imports would impose. A very good value in an American car with a famous 300 pedigree.
