            I received this digital camera as a birthday gift. I am not a photographer, so my interests in taking pictures encompass the capturing of memories, not of capturing beautiful art pieces. For this purpose, this camera is perfect for the person who takes 4 rolls of pictures on the average weekend trip.

On a recent weekend ski trip, I memorialized it by taking lots of pictures and sending them to those on the trip as well as other friends. (Let me also say that the camera performed in negative 40 degree weather). The pictures come out fine, and, the lowest resolution setting is higher than needed for this purpose, and you can fit 36 on the 4 meg card that the camera comes with. I have yet to buy a bigger capacity card, but am sure this will come in handy on longer trips.

The LCD is great. Downloading is easy, although, I've only been able to get the USB port to work once. Strange. But I attribute this kink to Windows 98. 

The biggest downside to this camera is the unbelievable drain it has on regular batteries. Wow! It just sucks the power out! So, for 60 bucks, I bought a portable battery pack to save money. It's a bit of a pain to have an extra accessory to carry around with you, but it works and it's cheaper. There are rechargeable batteries on the market as well, but this option is more expensive. I always have the option of using regular batteries in a bind.

Although a bit clunky in size (I've seen some slick ones that are half the thickness) I think this is a good introductory digital camera. The way I see it, digital camera prices are going to go down across the board significantly within the year (at latest). When this does happen, I plan on upgrading to a more portable camera, and pass down this camera to my younger sister. Everybody wins.
