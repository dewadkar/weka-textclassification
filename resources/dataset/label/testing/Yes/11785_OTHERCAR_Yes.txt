<TEXT>
            I purchased a 1994 Lexus LS400 with 30,000 miles in late 1995.  Currently, the car has over 136,000 miles and I have had no problems with this vehicle except for the remote door locks.  I originally purchased this car for its reliability and luxurious comfort.  This has been by far the most reliable car I have ever owned.  I feel that I can put another 100,000 miles on it without major expense.

The only negatives I would point out are: 

1. the sound system which is not as robust as it should be in a car in this class.
2.the handling which is fine for a big car, but I have found that I prefer a sportier, more nimble car and would probably purchase a GS400 or BMW for my next car.

If you are in the market for a big luxury car I would not hesitate to buy this car again.  The acceleration is strong and smooth.  However, if you are in the car alone most of the time and don't need all the room, then the GS400 gives all of the quality, almost all of the luxury, and a lot more driving fun for less money.<br><br>
