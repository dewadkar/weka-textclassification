            I went to Nashville at the beginning of the summer ( I traveled by bus � don�t do it folks!). I snapped lots of photos with a nice, new little APS camera. 

What was I thinking? Forget the fact that once I paid for film and processing I had shelled out for more than the cost of the camera, what really scared me was Walgreens, 

&quot;Do you develop APS?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, we do that. What�s EPS?&quot;

I wondered if that was the last time I would see the little plastic canister that housed my once-in-a-lifetime images. 

Like everything else, my life is moving online. All I really wanted to do with the photos, when and if I got them, was scan them and post them to my web page for friends and family to see.

So why didn�t I buy a digital camera to begin with? I can�t release that information at this time, highly classified government stuff. 

Once I got clearance, I went to Amazon.com with the goal of finding an inexpensive, small, easy, MAC compatible digital camera. I found the RCA CDS 1000.

First of all, I like anything that has large numbers in the name because it sounds old school futuristic (BIZ STONE 9000, GENIUS-ROBOT!). But seriously folks, this cheap little camera is GREAT. 

Here�s the gist. It�s small enough to fit into my pocket, takes great photos, and plugs into my laptop to grab the photos in a few seconds. It takes 16 hi-rez photos (better if you want to make prints), or 32 compressed. And it takes regular AA batteries. The really great part is that I am totally in charge of the whole process, and the camera was the only thing I had to pay for! 

The reason it�s cheap, I think, is because it doesn�t have removable media. Meaning, once you take all the pictures, you have to get them onto your computer or delete them before you can take more. It�s fine for me because I take it along on quick outings.

My girlfriend is a craft designer/author and she has been using the camera to snap images of her work, emailing them to speed up the approval process with her editor.

Here�s a couple more cool things. You can plug the camera into your tv with the supplied cord and look at the photos � they look really good on tv. The camera also comes with a power adapter so you don�t have to use batteries if you�re inside. It comes with a belt-case too.

So anyway, I love my CDS 1000 and recommend it highly. Unfortunately, I took it out with me the other night when I went to a restaurant called &quot;Super Buffet&quot; and I dropped it, hard, onto a tiled floor. Now it only works when I hold it at a certain angle. I�m gonna see if I can return it and get another one. If I can�t return it, I�m actually just going to buy it again, that�s how much I like it!
