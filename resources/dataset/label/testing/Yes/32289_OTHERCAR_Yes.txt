            I "inherited" a 93 Camry LE V6 from a relative in 2000 and paid a symbolic 500$ for it. The car now has 98K miles on it and still performs flawlessly. I enjoy the powerful acceleration of the V6 everyday, it also saved me a few times from getting rammed by other drivers cutting me off on the freeway.(Note: underpowered cars are dangerous because it takes too long to get out of harm's way!). If you are a sporty driver, you can easily leave faster cars behind you at a stop light if you want due to the ample torque available.

On the downside, the car doesn't get great gas mileage - about 22 mpg on the freeway and less than 20 in city driving shows that it is 10 years old. Compare that to an Impala today - the car I feel is closest to mine. Also, since there is neither traction control nor ABS, the car may skid on wet surfaces and you have to be extremely careful when you brake hard in bad road conditions, as the front will just brake out.

Whenever I can, I let myself be driven by my fiancee with another passenger in front. The rear legroom is better than a much larger car's, e.g. a Crown Victoria. The rear seat is also extremely comfortable, just like all seats. Foldable rear seats made the car a great tool for a move, the trunk is also large enough for a family trip.

Even though several car mechanics have congratulated me on the car and expected it to last for 200K plus miles, the front brakes need to be fixed every year. This is something that I have also discussed with other Camry owners who seem to have the same problems - Camrys of this series just eat through pads and rotors. Apart from that, only regular maintenance has been necessary in the two and a half years and 30,000 miles since I've gotten it.
