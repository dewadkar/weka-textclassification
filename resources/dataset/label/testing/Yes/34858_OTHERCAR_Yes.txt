            This is my third Honda, and my first used Honda.  I managed to walk onto the dealer's lot after someone had just traded in their 2000 Odyssey LX for a BMW X5.  I bought it on the spot.  I was about ready to buy a Toyota or Ford because I didn't want to have to wait.  I am so glad I lucked upon this vehicle.  It has smooth and very quick pickup.  It's very easy to drive, considering I drove a CRX for the last 11 years.  Once you drive a minivan you never want to go back, and once you drive a Honda, you never want anything else.  If this performs anything like my CRX, as long as you give it regular oil changes and do the Honda recommended scheduled maintenance you can easily get 125,000++ miles out of it.  I plan on getting twice that.

The driving position is better than the 2000 Ford Windstar, and it also handles better.  Unlike the Ford and even the Chrysler, it has no hesitation when you step on the accelerator.  It brakes straight and quick with it's anti-lock brakes, which unfortunately I had to use today. It also handles quick swerves rather well - it feels like my CRX does, just a little heavier.  (The CRX is Honda's old 2 seater, tiny car.)  I have driven over many big/deep potholes that in any other car I would hate to hit, but in this minivan, they just feel like bumps.  The turning radius is far better than Ford's and even Chrysler's - a plus when you need to back out of a parking space in a narrow lane parking lot.

The step in height is slightly lower than the Windstar according to my mother-in-law.  The lift gate opens easily, but takes a little more strength to bring down.  I've been able to open it with a sedan parked about 1 foot away from the bumper.  This will be a plus later when I eventually have to replace the lifts - which should be a while after 100,000 miles, if these lifts are better than my CRX's.

By far the best feature is the fold-down into the floor third row seat.  I have used that feature numerous times.  I don't know what I would have done if I had a Ford/Chrysler/Toyota where I could not stow the seat in the floor. You can't very well pop out the back seat at the shopping center and come back and pick it up later!!-- (which is the choice you are left with for the others.)

The dual sliding doors are a necessity, especially when it's raining and you need to put your baby into his seat.  All you do is step in on the other side so both of you can stay dry.

The cons.  

The position of the gear shifter in relation to the radio volume knob is too close.  You don't know how many times I have missed the shifter and ended up blasting the radio by accident.

I like features in other minivans that Honda simply does not offer.  Cup indentations and hard plastic on the back of the 2nd row seats should be standard (like the Toyota) - so you don't have to deal with punctures like I have on the back my CRX's seat.  

Another minus is that some of Honda's accessories require some form of drilling or cutting into the panels or exterior pieces.  Other brands are designed with hooks or covered predrilled mounting holes/brackets.  For instance the cargo net accessory requires cutting into either the paneling or the back of the 3rd row seat (I don't remember which - but check out the installation instructions).  All those little nicks and cuts are very noticeable and cause larger problems as the car ages.

Another missing feature (which may be at odds with the fold-down into the floor seat) are bag hooks.  Maybe a better option would be the back shelf offered on Chrysler's 2001 minivans.

EDITED-BEGIN-ADDED:
Here's one that I wish Honda would fix.  Twice a cup full of coke has flown out of the cup holders while I am making a turn.  The problem isn't that I am a speed racer - I turn relatively slowly.  The problem is that the center console's cup holders are either too big or too small.  The leather flaps that Honda adds in an attempt to fit smaller cups simply do not work.  I think Chrysler's minivans have a true plastic grip insert that expands and contracts to grip cups tightly.  I'll be looking for an aftermarket insert to put into the Honda cup holders to prevent another night of carpet cleaning.
EDITED-END

Finally a word about the gotchas.

Honda's must be repaired and have maintenance performed by trained Honda technicians.  Don't go to Firestone, or Jiffy Lube.  They simply can't handle the special features that make Honda's last a long time.  For instance, I once made the mistake of going to Firestone for a tuneup of my CRX.  The car ran _worse_ until I took it to a real Honda tech.  Recently Jiffy Lube managed to strip the oil pan drain hole in that same car.  Reason: Honda uses a special single use crush washer for their oil drain plugs.  Jiffy Lube tosses the washer out, doesn't replace it, then overtightens the plug which strips the drain pan hole.  So you now have a leaky car and need a repair by you guessed it - a Honda tech.  Even the brake fluid and power steering fluid must be Honda brand - check your warranty.  

You don't have to go to a Honda dealer -- as long as you go to a Honda specialist.  Get a referral to the best in your area, ask someone with an older Honda that looks well taken care of.  Even with the perceived increased cost of a Honda specialist or dealer, you will still end up paying less over the long haul in maintenance and minor repairs for a Honda than if you buy another brand for less.  Even if you have that other brand repaired/maintained at those 'cheaper' non dealer/non specialist shops.  I have yet to spend more than $750/year on my 11 year old CRX - including tires, brakes, etc.
