               The 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best SUV on the market this year. I personally own one, and I have never had any problems with it. Never a flat tire or a breakdown of any kind. 
   The new Jeep's standard features include a 4.0L Power Tech I-6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission, Sentry KeyTM Engine Immobilizer, Four-wheel disc antilock brake system, P225/75R16 Goodyear Wrangler ST, black sidewall all-season tires, 16 x 7-inch Sport cast aluminum with Silver accents.(www.Jeep.com) My experiences with the Jeep Grand Cherokee have been great. 
   The engine has always run smoothly and long trips are comfortable. It is a very fun car. Built tough for off road usage you can take this SUV anywhere, and with tons of storage space you can take everything you would need for an offroad adventure. I would recommend this SUV to a person who wants a durable, reliable means of transportation. <br><br>
