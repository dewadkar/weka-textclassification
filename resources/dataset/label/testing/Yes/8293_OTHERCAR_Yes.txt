            This was the first brand new car I ever purchased.  It is now 1 year and 4 months old with 56,000km on it.

I would like to first say the bad things about this car, as people tend to remember the last thing they read better.

The dashboard honestly has 6 or 7 different rattles that all happen during different temperatures/humidities.  They range from the far left in the door, to inside the dashboard, to the surface of the dashboard, to the spedometer, to the passenger side dashboard, to inside the glovebox, to the passenger window.

I have had the car to see Toyota about this twice now and they have only resolved one of these rattles.  The regulator on the drivers door crank needed to be replaced.

The only other bad points about it are the how noisey the engine is.  Some engines are loud and sound sporty but it just sounds loud and sort of scary.

Finally, it may be because of the height, I find it does not handle well when cornering in snow or heavy rain.  It is hard to predict how it will react in various situations.

Now the good.

Mechanically with 56,000 km this car has been a dream.  Oil changes every 8,000km and the basic maintenance, nothing else.  The engine does not use any oil still, and still drives and handles like it did when new.  The gas mileage is phenomenal ... with 42 mpg average and a best of 54 mpg since new (35 avg, 45 mpg best in US mi/gal).  It always starts (even with temperatures in -30ï¿½C without a block heater), and has never quit.  The standard transmission is fun to drive and makes the car responsive.  The steering is also quite responsive.

Compared to other manual transmissions I have driven though, the clutch is very fussy, but I am well used to it now.

The interior roominess is great (I am quite tall) and it is a comfortable ride.  All of the controls are in great places, the steering wheel is very comfortable, and the trunk room is great for a car this size.

The stock stereo is decent, but the FM distorts easily and the CD player does not like CDRs much.  It can read them some days, some days not.

Overall I would say the good far outweighs the bad (a reliable car is more important than a noiseless or super cushy car).  This car will probably outlast almost every other car in the market with the lowest maintenance and/or recalls.  

Plus - it was made here in Ontario Canada - Cambridge.  

So some days while the rattling dashboard is driving me crazy and Toyota won't do much about it and I am grumbling that I wish I had something else - I know inside that this car will take me far and that the grass isn't always greener on the other side - other cars may have slight ups or downs but the Corolla has more ups than downs.

My final comment is about the dealers and service departments.  I do not trust a word any of them say - but that seems to apply to most dealers / garages.  I think they are worse perhaps as they have tried to rip me off a couple times - first when I bought the car, and then when I hit a curb they said I would need $700 worth of repairs (tie rod ends, wheel bearings, etc.) when all I needed was a new rim.

So these "Real people selling real cars" are indeed just that - real people trying to get every cent they can to feed their families - they just might go too far.  Once my warranty is over I will never set foot in their garage again.

Thanks for reading my review and I hope you have found it helpful.
