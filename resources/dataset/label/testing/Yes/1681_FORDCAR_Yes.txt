            I've heard many people complain about this vehicle since it was first made known to the public.  So far I have found these complaints to be unfounded or just plain absurd.  The first one is that it is to big. The media has fueled an attack on SUV's in general and has come out heavily on this one.  My problem with this statement is that much larger and much heaver vehicles are on the road and have been since the early 1900's.  No one has done stories on eighteen wheelers being banned from the roads, why are they so worried about the excursion?  If someone wants a large vehicle then by all means they should have one.  The next complaint is that they sit to high and they're a threat to small cars. That sounds like a great reason to get the little cars off the road to me. In defense to there height I must point out that these are built on 3/4 and one ton truck chassis which have always sat up high.  Also there are hundreds of thousands of modified four-wheel drives that sit way higher than these trucks.  The third point people make is that these trucks drink too much gas.  Why do they care? They don't have to put fuel in these trucks.  Well they say that the more gas they take the more pollutants are put out.  Let me say now that I am not an environmentalist but this is a reasonable concern.  However, autos put out only 10% of the total harmful pollutants. (I'm talking about CO and HC) The biggest polluters are industry. The fact is that at $40,000 each the sales of these are not going to be that great. In the entire scheme of things this vehicle is not going to devour small cars or blow holes in the ozone layer.
