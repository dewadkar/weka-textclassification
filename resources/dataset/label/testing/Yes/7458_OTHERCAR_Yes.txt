            Just because I am 30 something and Mom to two awesome sons doesn't mean that I am ready to leave all my fun behind.  The Grand Am is the kind of car that reminds me of my life and those of my friends.  Dependable and reliable, but oh so sweet and smooth!  Inside it's roomy and comfortable for a family vacation, but outside it's sleek and sporty.

My first experience with a Grand Am was my Mom's 1987.  I shared this car with Mom and we ran it to 20 miles shy of 200,000 when the engine locked up due to an oil leak.  It had been a great car and we were sad to see the old girl go.  I swore I would get another one someday.  

This past fall, my husband and I bought a midnight blue 2000 Grand Am and we love it.  It didn't take long to convince him -- one test drive and he was sold!  I don't know much about power and everything under the hood, but what I do know is the car handles well, stops easily, and runs smoothly.  <br><br>
