            My Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited has about 35000 miles on it and the only thing it has gone in for is a new steering wheel because the old one wore out, (cheap steering wrap leather), new logos on the sides (they were peeling away), and new floor mats (my heel wore through).  
I am hard on my Jeep and it really performs.  The only complaints are that the backseat can't really hold a large adult unless the front seat is moved up forward cramping that person in front. The seats are very comfortable but not for the long haul. 
My other complaint is minor but I notice it, the transaxle has a whine above 50 and the dealer says it is within "specs".  I don't understand that term, but it dosen't affect the car any.
Off-Road the Quadra drive is a real shine through system and the ride is superb. The interior is nicely furnished with sim wood and leather.  The memory heated seats are great for my wife and I in the winter. Resale on these trucks is not excellent but decent. I love my truck, "its a jeep thing!!!!"
