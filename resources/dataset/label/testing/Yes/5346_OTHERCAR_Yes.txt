            This van was the interesting one. It is by far the best looking minivan out there. I especially liked how Chrysler was the first company to hide the door tracks under the windows, which cleaned up the sides and made the car look halfway decent.

The company was also quite innovative when it came to a number of features. The four doors of course, but then there was the numerous little vents scattered around the cabin, which worked to keep everyone the same temperature, unless of course the dual-zone temp control was set to different temps. 

We had the most powerful engine by Plymouth, and the second most powerful overall in the Chrysler minivan line. Power was more than adequate in a number of different situations: loaded full with people, empty, towing a box trailer with 4 people with huge amounts of stuff on a vacation, etc. 

The interior of the van was very comfortable, especially on long rides. The dashboard was very legible and the interior design was first rate. A great stereo system for a minivan.

About roominess: the van was huge on the inside. For some reason, my mom's favorite place was in the far back seat. I personally liked the second-row captains' chairs.

Now come the complaints:

-Heavy seats to remove. Last seats cumbersome to remove and store.

-Build quality wasn't the best. For the first few months, there was a really annoying rattle in the passenger side of the dash. It eventually mysteriously went away. 

- A couple of the speakers stopped working, but were repaired under warranty. 

- The interior front door panels came loose and had to be snapped back in.

-The transmission had to be replaced at about 20k miles, but was done under warranty.

- The battery had to be replaced once.

- The dealer who we dealt with did the stuff that needed to be done, but wasn't very friendly in doing it. Nor were they especially quick.

Overall, the design and comfort of the van was first-rate. However, the quality and reliability issues of the van were called seriously into question. Basically, get rid of the car before the warranty runs out, or you might be in for some serious repair costs.<br><br>
