            I had a 1996 S10.  It was a no-frills model with a 5 speed and 2.2 l four cylinder.  The truck got around 25 MPG of freeway/city driving, was peppy and never gave me one problem.  I can't speak for the fully loaded ones with 4wd, but mine was a solid, reliable, and comfortable truck.

I bought it for $8,600 w/o tax, etc.  I added about $500 in accessories to the truck.  I sold it, after 3 years of ownership for $7,000.  Pretty good resell in my book.

I'd recommend one to anyone interested in a truck.<br><br>
