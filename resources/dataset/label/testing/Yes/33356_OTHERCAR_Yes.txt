               The Pathfinder is an excellent car for those who need an sport utility vehicle, but don't want the hassle of some of the extremely larger ones. The Pathfinder is large enough to hold 6 passengers comfortably, and has large storage space in the back. We bought our vehicle for transporting goods, and traveling. But, we use it to drive EVERYWHERE. The Pathfinder drives like a regular sedan, yet it handles like a powerful truck. I would really suggest this car to those who want the power and ease of driving. In my opinion, this car has everything a person needs, good quality, class, and style. <br><br>
