            I've never owned one of these, but I insist on getting one whenever I rent from Avis. They are the best of the normal class cars that Avis rents, and I have become quite attached.

The car is comfortable inside, though very sporty. The seat is low and hard for a tall person to get into, but very adjustable. It has much more legroom and headroom that most GM cars. I find that I cannot get the seat back far enough on a Chevrolet or Oldsmobile, but the Pontiac Grand Prix is quite comfortable.

Then the best part: the drive. The engine under the hood provides fantastic acceleration. I'm going 60 and decide I need to pass someone: no problem. One push on the accelerator, and it's as if the other guy is standing still. The control is very good, and the turning radius means fast moves in tight areas aren't much of a problem.

In short, this has the normal problems a sporty car does -- low gas mileage, stiff suspension, some road noise, and low seats. But it has all the advantages and then some at a very reasonable price.
