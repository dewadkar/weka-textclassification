            I have a 1997 dark blue SL2 with Black interior.  As much as I love the car, I dont.  I had a 1996 SL2 that i was hit in the side by someone who ran a red light with an older ford crown victoria and totalled it.  I loved it so much and it took the hit so well that I walked out of it and the person driving the large ford did not.  It is truely a safe car.  I never had any trouble with the '96 and it had 15,000 on it at 9 mos.  I went out to get my 97 saturn immediately and I ordered it.  The dealership is wonderful to work with.  No pressure and honest as can be.  All that is true with saturn.  Problem Lies in this 97.  during cold weather it has many rattles and squeeks until it warms up.  They did totally redo the car for 2000 and I find the 2000 car much better as I have borrowed one from the dealer while mine was in the shop and what a difference.  I have had many stupid problems with this car from bad spark plugs to alternators, rattles in the moonroof, new cruise control computer in it, rattle in rear window causing for them to replace that too.  I have also had problems with the engine idle and starter.  car would start and shut off immediately.  the belt had to be tightened twice already.  I have 24000 miles on it and it is 3 yrs old almost.  Other than that it has excellent insurance rates, great gas milage, very peppy engine for a 1.9 litre 4 dual over head cam.  their service is second to none.  I called and complained about the repairs to the saturn corp.  The next day I got a call back and they offered me a 5 yr 60,000 mi bumper to bumper 0 dollar deductible warranty for my trouble.  they went out of their way and contaced the dealer to be sure everything was fixed properly and it was.  I am really considering a LS for my next car (the new large saturn)<br><br>
