            Plymouths are very reliable cars.  Sundances are no exceptions.  This car has decent pick up.  It is a little sporty looking and in my opinion, very cute.  The car handles pretty well and is easy to repair at home.  The car has rarely been in the shop, except for the air conditioner.  The air has had a few problems and now it only works in high or not at all.  Also, this is true with the heat also.  It warms up pretty quickly and is low maintenance. Nothing major has ever went wrong with our car.  It is good for small families or families that need no car seat.  Also, it is good for teenagers.  It gets good gas mileage.  <br><br>
