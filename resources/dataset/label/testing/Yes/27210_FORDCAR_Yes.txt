            I purchased my first-ever brand new car from Kip Killmon's Tyson's Ford in Vienna, VA in October 2001.  The experience at the dealership was straightforward and pleasant. I got a dark green ZX3 with the power & premium package, manual transmission, ABS, side airbags, and sunroof.  I paid $16,800, MSRP was $17,600 and invoice was $16,500, so I think I got a pretty good deal.  One top of that I got a 60-month loan with no down payment and 0% interest.

The Focus comes in 3 body styles; sedan, wagon, and 3-door hatchback (zx3).  There are several trims levels for each, with everything from bare bones LX to a fully loaded ZTS sedan with leather.  The 2 engine choices are a 110 and 130 horsepower dual overhead cam 2.0 inline 4-cylinder. I would highly recommend you get the larger engine, especially if you are getting an automatic transmission.  Starting in 2002 you can also get a 5-door hatchback (ZX5), and a pocket rocket (or "rice rocket" if you prefer) SVT 3-door hatchback.  There were a few model changes between the 2000, 2001, and 2002 models, but they are minor.

The first thing you will notice about a focus is the styling. Ford likes to call it "New Edge".  Some people love it, some hate it, and I suspect if you count yourself in the later group then you have already made up your mind that the focus is not for you, and you won't be reading this review.

Now if you can get past the styling (or if you really like it, like I do) then the second thing you will notice about a focus is the interior.  Everything is in its place, and the quality of the interior materials is above-average for a small car.  For example, the climate control knobs use silicon dampeners, which normally you only find in more expensive cars.  Also, the turn signal stalk has a nice heavy feel to it. It doesn't feel like it's going to break off in your hand like I have noticed with many GM products.
The radio is right where it should be, ABOVE the climate controls, and the seats are very comfortable.  The driver's seat even has a crank you can twist to raise and lower the seat, so you don't feel like you are sitting on the floor.

Now if you turn the key and start the engine, you will be in for another surprise.  Yes it's a 4-cylinder, and nobody is going to mistake it for a V8 Mercedes, but as 4-cylinders go it's fairly quiet at idle and doesn't create a lot of vibration. (sit in a Focus at Idle and then go sit in a Chevy Cavalier or Hyundai Accent and you will see what I mean).

Now comes the really fun part which is driving the focus.  While nobody would call it a sports car (except perhaps in SVT form) it is certainly sporty, and can hold it's own on winding roads, especially with the larger 16-inch tires.  One the highway it's stable and sure-footed, and sound is kept out better than most cars in it's class.  Compared to the escort (the Ford car it replaced), the Focus is light year's ahead.  The 5-speed manual transmission does not have the snik-snik precision of a BMW, Honda, or VW, but it's the best domestic gearbox I've ever driven, and was much better than the Toyota Corolla I test-drove.  

On the negative side, the Focus has been recalled in the past 3 years with an alarming frequency.  While none of these recalls are what I would consider to be �serious� (as in �Don�t go over 50 miles an hour or your engine will explode�) if you are buying a used one you should be sure all the recalls have been taken care of. This would only apply to buying a car from a private person, as a dealer is required to take care of all recalls before they put the car on their lot.  To be fair in my review here are a few features you will NOT find on the focus that you can find on other small cars:

-The glove box does not lock

-There is not much room by the spare tire to store anything

-The cup holders don�t accommodate extra-large bottles.

-The engine is not as smooth under hard acceleration as in some other models.

-The change drawer/ashtray is kind of a dumb design

-Depending on how you like to shift, the armrest might interfere

-Ford�s standard bumper-to-bumper warranty is only 3 years/36,000 miles

-You are buying a car from the same company that builds the Excursion monstrosity.

All in all I give the Focus a solid 4 out of 5.  It�s not perfect, but it�s darn good, and when you look at everything put together I think Ford�s small car is better than anything else out there in this price range.
