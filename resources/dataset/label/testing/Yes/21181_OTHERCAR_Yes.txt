            I love our Prism.  It has in excess of 140,000 miles.  My husband has tried unsuccessfully for years to upgrade to a newer car, but I refuse.  The seats have faded from years in the sun, and we have a ding in the front lip of the hood from an unfortunate incident with a construction barrel, but the engine is solid.  I've had bad luck with cars in my past, and the experience of a car that actually runs reliably every day is fascinating to me.  When something has broken, it has been easily fixed and stays fixed.

We purchased this car in 1994 for $8000. It was a rental car and had 40,000 miles on it.  It was the first car we ever purchased that had under 100,000 miles on it.  

Over the years, we've replaced brakes and batteries and the other odd repair from time to time, but we've really never had a major repair with this car, mainly maintenance type work.  And it has never failed to turn over for me in the morning.  In 8 years, I think that's pretty fantastic.  The belts squeal, which drives me crazy, but I find a little belt dressing goes a long way.

The only con I can think of is that the body is not built as well as the engine itself, which I believe is actually a Toyota product.  There are some traits I believe that are pretty common with this model car.  When I come across another Prism on the street, one of the taillights / brake lights is always either very dim or out completely.  We had to replace the entire unit on our left side to get ours to work correctly.  The light inside the car has never worked, and no amount of new bulbs or new fuses will fix it, so we live with the darkness.  We've replaced 3 of the four door handles and had the ceiling redone when it started to fall about 3 years ago.  The plastic around the gearshift is long gone, along with a piece that strangely covered a bolt of some kind near the steering wheel.

But I consider all those things pretty trivial, and I plan on driving my prism until the wheels fall off.  She's been faithful to me, and I'll be faithful to her!
