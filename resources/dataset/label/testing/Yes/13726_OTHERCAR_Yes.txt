            A few years back BMW introduced the X5, the first SUV with handling that could be likened to that of a sport sedan with a straight face. For 2003 Nissan has introduced the <b><a href="/content_78434242180">Altima</a></b>-based Murano, the first somewhat affordable SUV in the <b><a href="/content_68178644612">X5</a></b> mold. (The hyperlinks lead to my reviews of related vehicles.) Interested in learning whether the Murano&#146s performance matched its sporty looks, I took an all-wheel-drive SL for a test drive. 

Epinions has recently begun providing cars with multiple listings that are not mutually exclusive. After much discussion with the category Leads and Advisors, I have decided to make the best of a messy situation by posting reviews of varying detail under the duplicate listings. This is my concise, 1,200-word Murano review. For my mid-length, 1,800-word review click <b><a href="/content_99974811268">here</a></b>. For my more detailed, 2,900-word review that discusses the differences between the SL and SE, click <b><a href="/content_108735794820">here</a></b>. 

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

Nissan&#146s comeback has been based on distinctive styling. The Murano has a strange, attention-getting design, yet it works. I especially like the somewhat retro shoulder that arcs down at the front and rear to include the vertical lamps. 

I have more persisting issues with the interior styling. The sport-bike-style instrument cluster and the floating center stack of the instrument panel contribute to the disjointed look of the interior. Like those in the Altima, the instrument panel and door panels look too plasticky. 

My biggest interior gripe concerns the driving position. The steeply raked windshield yields a very deep dash. I couldn&#146t help feeling like I was in a minivan. Not very sporty. The seating position is SUV high, and the view forward is very open. 

The seats front and rear are roomy, supportive, and very comfortable. Beyond their generous size, they have a softness to them that feels plush. 

As in the BMW X5, if to a lesser extent, cargo space behind the rear seat has been shortchanged in favor of tidy proportions and a sporty roofline. With the rear seat folded, cargo room is competitive with the <b><a href="/content_68879355524">Toyota Highlander</a></b>. 

<b>On the Road</b>

Even motivating two tons the 245-horsepower, 3.5-liter six feels plenty strong. The standard CVT helps, keeping revs high at full throttle. 

Sadly, all was not well with the Murano I drove. Under heavy throttle much driveline vibration was evident. This vibration could even be felt from the passenger seat. This might apply only to the vehicle I drove, or to all of them. I do not know. It did make me wonder if reliability might become an issue.

Handling was similarly uneven. The Murano leans little in hard turns and generally feels very balanced and stable. Many people evaluate handling on highway on-ramps, and here the Murano excels. Along a curvy road, the Murano&#146s chassis feels agile for a vehicle of its size, much less ponderous than a Honda Pilot and more tied down than a Toyota Highlander. Still, I never felt as if I was driving a car. 

My largest issue with the handling involved the steering. I enjoyed the heft of the steering, but would have appreciated more feel. When the Murano is driven aggressively, the steering effort sometimes dances all over the map, with sudden changes. 

The Murano rode fairly well during my test drive. I wouldn&#146t call it luxurious, but it certainly was not as harsh as some reviews led me to expect. 

Towards the end of the test drive something started burning under the hood of the Murano. The person in the next lane actually lowered his window to inform us, "Man, your truck is smokin!" Most likely some undercoating was sloppily applied to the exhaust manifold, but it could have been something more serious.

I did not measure fuel economy. I notice that owners are complaining about fuel economy in the high teens in their reviews. Given the power and weight of the Murano, this is what I'd personally expect, at best.

<b>Pricing</b>

As I&#146ve already alluded, the Murano while more affordable than a BMW X5 is still somewhat pricey. A base front-wheel-drive SL lists for nearly $29,000. All-wheel-drive adds $1,600 (a bit more than some charge, less than others), pushing the price over thirty. Want the $1,299 leather package? Then you must also order the overpriced &#147premium package&#148 ($1,499 gets you a Bose stereo, power adjustable pedals, and a cargo cover) and the sunroof. Check the box for heated seats, and the sticker runs to $34,635. Edmunds suggests that dealers typically knock off about $700. 

By any rational measure, a <b><a href="/content_68354674308">Honda Pilot</a></b> represents a much better value. It&#146s larger, has higher quality interior with a third row seat, and lists for $31,000 with leather. This price does not include a sunroof or heated seats; for these you must buy the pricier Acura MDX. Even after adjusting for these and the minimal discounting on this model, the Murano runs about $1,500 more. However, if you want sporty, then the Pilot is out of the running.

The same goes for the <b><a href="/content_68879355524">Toyota Highlander</a></b>. A Highlander equipped like the Murano I drove lists for $34,200. However, according to Edmunds the typical dealer discount brings the price down to about $30,500, just above invoice. This is over three grand under the Murano. However, the Highlander looks downright bland compared to the Murano and leans much more in turns. The Highlander does have a nicer interior and rides better. For most people, which vehicle is more appealing should be clear. It&#146s almost apples and oranges.

The vehicle most similar in concept to the Murano is the much-maligned Pontiac Aztek. The Aztek&#146s handling isn&#146t quite as sharp, its engine is much weaker, and its interior feels even cheaper than that of the Murano. But its price is much lower. Even with leather, sunroof, and uplevel stereo the sticker is just under thirty. After the typical dealer discount and a $3,000 rebate the price comes to about $24,400. This is almost ten thousand less than the Murano, which should help make up for the Aztek&#146s shortcomings.

The Murano&#146s price is high enough that some people might want to find a bit extra for the <b><a href="/content_102375853700">Infiniti FX35</a></b> (an SUV based on the 350Z/G35 platform). Comparably equipped the Infiniti lists for $38,845. Dealers discount them very little according to Edmunds. This is nearly five grand more than the Murano. For those who really care about handling and the quality of interior materials the extra money will be well spent.

The <b><a href="/content_68178644612">BMW X5 3.0</a></b> even lightly optioned with heated leather seats and a sunroof runs over $44,000. It&#146s interior is far nicer than the others here, but it also has the tightest rear seat and cargo area. Handling is agile yet the driving position and vehicle as a whole feel truckier than with the Murano. 

<b>Last Words</b>

Recommended with reservations. The exterior turns me on, but the interior turns me off. The powertrain is versatile, but could benefit from further refinement. The handling is very good for an SUV, largely fulfilling the sporty styling. Even if other SUVs begin to be perceived as family vehicles, the Murano will not be. All in all, the Murano might be a bit undercooked in places, but I suspect that many people will be drawn to this unique package.
