            I recently upgraded from an Olympus D-200 L to the Olympus D-340R.  What a treat!  I can't believe how much better the quality is over the earlier version.  I am just now getting ready to use it on my ebay ads and for the website I'm building and the pictures look so professional!  
For more than $300 less than I paid for my original Olympus I got great close focus or 2x zoom capabilites along with a host of other goodies that I haven't had time to play with yet. I really like the fact that the close-up shots are as clear and focused as the medium range ones - this is a great improvement over the earlier Olympus.
I also recommended this camera to a very non-technical relative and they were able to produce the same great results with very little difficulty.  For anyone who does ebay, makes their own catalogs or webpages or just likes to send great pictures in their email this camera really delivers!<br><br>
