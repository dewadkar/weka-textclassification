             I own one and trust me it's awesiome. 225 hp V6 is all you nees.Advantages of the Lexus IS 300 become apparent at first glance of the interior styling -- more pleasing to the eye and sacrodiliac than similarly priced offerings from other automobile makers. The seats are comfortable and comforting. The leather manages to be both plush and rugged without appearing to be coldly designed by an unromantic industrialist.It is my understanding that most of the Lexan advances in manufacture &amp; design have been contained to &quot;under-the-hood&quot; engineering in this model, but this vehicle takes a great step forward for Lexus in terms of cosmetics and visual appeal. It is definately the best car in a $30000 range, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. Highly recommend!
