            <b>Yes, you saw the title right.</b>  I just bought a 1990 Chevy Beretta with 255,000 miles on it.  Would you say I was crazy??  Probably!

A friend of mine owns a small dealership and he cut me some slack.

Yes, the car has 255,000 miles on it, but it also has a rebuilt engine.  
<i>Whats that? Wheeew, you say?</i>

I paid for the car in cash and took off the next day from Iowa heading for Chicago.  What a trip! Let me say that again.......What a trip!!!

We left about 10 a.m. and made it about 30 miles down the road when the cars engine started heating up. Luckily a friend was taking the trip with me because I would have never known the car was heating up.  I hardly ever look at the gauges.  (I've learned my lesson.)

<i>I said what's this?? Heating up?????</i>  We pulled over and put the car in park.  The engine started cooling down.  So, what did we do?   We took off on the road again.  And again about 30 miles down the road the car was heating up again.

We weren't sure what to do.  So we got off at the next exit and found the nearest mechanic.  We told him our troubles with the car and that I had just bought it the day before.  They looked it over and said they thought it was the thermostat.  

<i>&quot;Well fix it up</i>, I said.

in bout 45 minutes we were on the road again.  <i><b>BUT !!!</b></i>

About 30 miles down the road the engine was heating again!  So we decided the gauge <b>must</b> be wrong.  So we got all the way to Iowa 80 Truck Plaza. (about 2 hours driving.)  We decided to have a mechanic look at it there.  They looked and poked for about 45 minutes and finally came and told us not to drive the car at all.  <b>The car had a crack in the radiator.</b>   OMG!!!

We had to stay over night in a motel and had AAA tow us to the next town over to have it fixed.

We did finally make it to Chicago!!!!

The car runs smooth, I get good gas mileage, and the body looks good.

It does have A/C, AM/FM cassette player, but no power door locks or windows.

It's a white, 1990, chevy beretta with tinted windows.  

<i><b>AND A NEW RADIATOR!</b></i>
