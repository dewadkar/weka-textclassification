            I waited months for my X5, well worth the wait. If you are already interested in an X5, you might be agonzing over what options to get... I did. The sports package lowers the car and improves handling a great deal but makes for heavier steering and a stiffer ride, so if you live in an area with lots of potholes, pass on it. The nav system w/ onboard computer is great, and and allows you to set times the car will start ventilation so you never have to get into an oven on hot days. Xenon headlights, why wouldn't you get them? Much, much better nighttime visibility. The enhanced sound system is unnecessary, the basic one is already far better than you usually find in cars. Parking sensors are extrememly helpful if you live in a city where parking is scarce, and can greatly reduce parking frustration if you are moving from a car to an SUV. The rain-sensing wipers are only useful if you often have inclement weather. But if it rains or snows often, they make a world of difference because you will never have to fiddle with working the wipers at the right speed. 

Fully-loaded, there is nothing the car enthusiast will find lacking (except perhaps good gas mileage!). The X5 is not a sedan-type BMW, so it does not drive/handle like one (it's close). But compare the handling and drive feel to any SUV out on the market and you will see why people love their X5s. It's unmistakably a BMW.  The interior is much like any other BMW, but the rear seats are a bit hard and less ergonomic than expected. All the reviews in the world cannot compare to actually driving one. So if you are considering an X5, go out to your nearest BMW dealership and test drive one. The car will speak for itself.
