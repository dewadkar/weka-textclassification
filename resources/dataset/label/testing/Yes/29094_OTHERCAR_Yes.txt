            This truck turned my head immediately.  I was out looking for a used SUV that I could use on ski trips.  There were 4 Tacomas on the lot, all bran new.  It didn't take long for the salesman to talk me into a test drive.  There were 2 miles on it, and I loved everything about it.  Smooth shifting, comfortable interior, rear sliding window, AC, and plenty of power to handle freeway and uphill acceleration.  3 hours later I found myself driving it home on an affordable lease plan.

I love the various compartment space within the cab, beverage holders for both passenger and driver, clutch bypass button for automatic starting, AC, and duel air bags with an option to disable the passenger side for transporting infants.  4X4 was a big factor for me because I drive in the snow quit often.  This is the first truck I have ever had and I can't say enough about the convienence of being able to carry what I want when I want.  Another factor was the ground clearance for getting through and over snow, debris, etc.  It gets very good gas mileage and rides smooth.

Some things I wish I had at times are a clock, stereo/CD (haven't installed one yet), cruise control for the longer trips, or bed liner.  It surprised me how much of a beating the bed takes when there is no protection.  Other than no cruise, driving this truck is very smooth and quiet.  The truck is just over a year old and other than regular oil changes there have been no reason for maintenance.<br><br>
