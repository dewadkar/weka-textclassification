            People will stare when you drive this car because there are so few of them out on the road.  Toyota is only making 5,000 a year.  This is great if you're lucky enough to find one.  However, since they are so limited dealers are marking up the prices.  The MSRP is around $24,000.  One dealer in Colorado is selling a yellow one for $29,000.  I purchased mine in Colorado for $26,000.  

For only having 138HP this car is fast because it is so light, it only weighs 2,100 pounds.  It's the lightest car in its class.  Another great thing about this new remodeled car is that it is being compared with the Porsche Boxster.  I actually had someone come up to me thinking it was a Boxster. A reason for this comparision, besides it's body style is that it has a mid-engine design like the Boxster.

Acceleration is great and handling is excellent.  Plus the car is real fun to drive.  It comes standard with just about everything you want, except cruise control.  It has a manual top that is really easy to use and the top snaps in place.  There's also a wind deflector.  

It comes with power windows and side mirrors, single in dash CD player with cassette.  The glove box locks and there are two lockable compartments behind both seats.
However, that does it for storage space.
