            I bought my Suzuki Swift Sedan in large part because it was cheap.  My Toyota Truck needed brakes and tires that I couldn't afford and I went to the dealer and picked up this 93 Swift for about five grand with 60,000 miles on it..  In hindsight that probably wasn't the brightest move I ever made but I got lucky and bought this little car, which has turned out to be indestructible.  As of today it has 168,000 miles on it and appears to be running fine.  I haven't had a major repair other than brakes and tires, my old nemesis.

Please understand where I come from when it comes to cars.  I was 24 years old when I bought my 1993 Swift but my wants were not typical of that age group.  This car will not impress women or win a street race.  It will start every morning, get 40 miles to a gallon of gas, and run for an inordinate amount of miles.  I have always believed in function over fashion when it comes to cars, and if you share that mindset, this may be a car for you.  On the other hand if you want a high performance vehicle to give you status, I advise you to keep shopping.

As I mentioned before this car has two basic strengths: fuel economy and reliability.  In this summer of skyrocketing gas prices, the fuel economy has been a godsend.  Even at my advanced mileage, my little Swift gets 40 miles to the gallon and it was closer to 45 in its heyday.  Also, over the last three years I have been a cash-strapped college student so the fact that this car started even in the cold Wisconsin night has been extremely valuable.  Its ride is comfortable for the type of car it is but expect to feel some vibration if you need to go 80 miles per hour.

The biggest drawback to a Swift is the lack of power.  It has a 1.3 liter engine that leaves it straining to climb even moderate hills.  I have a five-speed and inevitably downshift to get up hills.  Other complaints include the hardware in the car.  This is an economy car and it shows in little things like door handles and control knobs.  I have broken a couple off and now appear to be the consumate gentleman when I step around to let people out the passenger side.  It's not exactly a choice, the door doesn't open from the inside.  The back seat is roomy enough for two smaller adults which was a surprise.  They won't stretch out and relax but they can ride in mostly comfortable conditions.  In addition the trunk space is excellent.

In conclusion, I can't ask for more from this car.  I have driven it hard, occasionally gone way overdue on an oil change, and stretched the tire life and yet I still drive it.  In the last 10,000 miles it has begun to leak a little oil but my mechanic assures me that if I make sure it doesn't get low, this car will probably go over 200,000 miles or more.  I'd jump in it and drive cross country tomorrow without fear.  If you have the self-confidence to go for practicality over style, I recommend trying a Suzuki Swift Sedan.
