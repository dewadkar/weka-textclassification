            The Plymouth Breeze was the first mid-sized with larger car room.   The front and back seats have plenty of leg room and they are comfortable on long trips (over 3 hours).   The car handles very well at highway speeds as well as over back roads.   The only trips to the shop have been for regular maintenance (Oil changes, rotate tires).   There was 1 factory recall but this was handled fast and efficiently.   The gas mileage is very good all-around.   

I would not hesitate to recommend this car to anyone.   I have been very happy with the vehicle and would buy another.
