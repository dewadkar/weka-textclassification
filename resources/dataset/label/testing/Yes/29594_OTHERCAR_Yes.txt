            When we decided to replace our gas guzzling Dodge Durango in November 2000, we started the search for a Mini-van with an open mind. We were looking for a decent price on a minivan with a 6 cylinder engine and some basic convenience items. Not a luxury conversion van.

After researching and shopping around, we arrived at Sheehy Nissan in Glen Burnie, MD to see their vans. Since the 2001 models were already out, we found that we could get a very good deal on a 2000. There were plenty to choose from, and we found our future van sitting right there. We drove away that same night with our van on the road (tax/title) for $21,500.

WHAT WE LIKE: 
1. TV/VCR combo. I have to rank this as the best thing about our van. We have a 4 year old son and let me tell you, it has been great on long trips for him to bring a video along.
2. Smooth, powerful engine. This van is very quiet and smooth to drive. The V6 Nissan engine (Same as the MAXIMA) has power to spare and it seems to be extremely reliable thus far.
3. Comfort items. With power windows/door locks, heated side mirrors, rear seat radio controls, dual rear sliding doors, and pull out cup holders, this van has everything we were looking for.

WHAT WE DON'T LIKE: 
1. Very difficult for an adult to get into the 3rd row seat unless he/she is a contortionist. It is especially difficult when there is a child's car seat buckled in place on the right side of the row 2 seat.
2. The cup holder under the middle bench seat. It is not very sturdy and my 5 year old has managed to break it by stepping on it. 
3. We had a problem with our gas cap. The ratchet mechanism inside broke and we could not open the cap to put fuel in the tank. Dealer had to pry old cap off and install a new one under warranty. Really was not a big deal, but it could have been a major problem if this had happened on a weekend or a long road trip.
