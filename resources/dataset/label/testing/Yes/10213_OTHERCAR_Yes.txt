            About 8 months before our lease was up with our 1997 Rav 4, my husband started researching on the web for the best SUV on the market.  He found that the Lexus far out ranked everyone else from cabin space inside to gas mileage.  I looked at the price tag and immediately put my foot down.  No way, much too expensive!  
	But, he took me for a test drive and tried to get me to melt.  Under great pressure from him and the salesman, I cracked and signed on the dotted line.  Over the last 5 months of leasing, I've gotten used to this SUV and can deal with the payments.  It is definitely worth the money.  
	Anyway, here are the systems that make the Lexus fun to take on road trips and definitely get us noticed.   

<b>The Seats</b>
The seats are leather, and the settings are fully automatic. I like the two buttons, his and hers, that you can set so the car  "remembers" your seat setting.  They have "heat seaters," (as I kept messing up and calling them) or better known as seat heaters.  These heaters are great for a sore back after work.  Though, be sure to warn new passengers that the heaters are on.  I forgot to tell a friend and she began to sweat.  She thought she had sat on something wet.  Oh no!  To turn them on there is a button that sets them to left seat only or left and right seat on.  I wished they also had a button for right seat only.  I'm sure they've remedied this in the 2000 or 2001 model.

<b>The LCD monitor</b> 
In the middle of the front panel is an LCD monitor that looks like a little TV.  People often ask us when the movie is coming on.  This monitor, however, does not show movies.  It is a center of information for many of the systems I'll explain below.  On the top part of the screen it has mpg, the temperature outside, and the time.  Right below that is the temperature that you have set the heating/cooling system to, how much the blower is blowing, and to what areas of the car the blowers are blowing.  With knobs below the LCD monitor, you can change the settings to suit your preferred interior car environment.  And in the last level of the LCD monitor, it shows which CD is playing, what track, and the time elapsed of the song.  There are buttons that you can push to change all of these preferences.  You can also make the monitor brighter or dimmer according to your liking.  We keep it bright because it helps us to see everything on the monitor at night as well as during the day. 

<b>The Sound System</b>
A Nakamichi sound system puts out the most amazing sound I've ever heard.  Lexus sure did a good job in choosing this system.  The six CD changer that is located in the glove compartment is wonderful.  The controls for skipping to the next CD or song on a CD are also easily accessible from the driver's side.  There is also a tape player and radio tuner.  The sound when you use the CD, tape player or radio is great.  And most importantly, I've never had any problems with the speakers.

<b>The Heating/Cooling System</b>
This is a really interesting system that you can see on the LCD monitor in the center of the car.  You can actually set the temperature to whatever you want (like 65 or 63 degrees) and the car blows air accordingly. A knob on the right side of the front panel controls the blowers.  By turning it, you can lower or intensify the blowing.  On the LCD monitor it looks like a sound wave that gets bigger or smaller.  And, the last part of this system is where you want the air to blow.  On the LCD monitor this is represented by a picture of a passenger seated and you push a knob below to change the blowers to either facial blowers, feet blowers, both face and feet blowers, or facial blowers and defrost.  These are the only settings.  But, they pretty much cover what you need from the blowers.  There are also blowers located in the middle section for the back passengers.        

<b>The Sunroof and Windows</b>
The sunroof is one of my favorite parts of this car.  You can tilt it or slide it all the way back.  I usually tilt it, because sliding it all the way back lets the sun shine directly on my head.  I don't like getting sun burnt in my car.  The sunroof is also tinted.  
The windows are great!  They all automatically go down at a push of a button.  They also go up with one push as well.  I also like a safety feature they have.  If something is in the window (like an arm or head) and someone tries to put up the window, the window senses the object and immediately goes back down.  To say the least, I was impressed.

<b>For Passengers</b>
The back seat is very roomy and I have no worries about taking our friends with us.  Our Rav 4 was quite squishy and I felt sorry for our friends who are much taller than us.  There are three individual headrests and great legroom in the back seat.  There is comfortable seating for everyone.  

<b>The Trunk</b>
It is really large and I can fit things in it that I couldn't fit in our other car.  I especially like how the two back seats fold down so that it seems like they were never there.  We can fit large packages in it with ease.  

<b>The Engine</b>
Zoom zoom.  With a roaring V6, it has a lot of power for a little SUV.  I really like that, because before my Rav 4 only had a 4 cylinder.  I hated having to floor it to get up a hill.  This engine is just right for my taste.  It gets me where I want to go quickly.   
It is also a very quiet engine.  I have to be very careful when I see little kids playing near the street.  They can't hear this engine and if they're not looking, they don't hear me coming.  I've scared a few kids with how close I am to them.  I usually have to go really slow or sit there and wait for them to move.  (I'm not one to honk; most kids get yelled at enough these days.)   

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
I'm pretty sure that we get 30 miles per gallon.  My husband keeps track of and pays for the gas that goes into Lexi.  He tells me it is about the same as the Rav.  

<b>Door Locks and Security</b>
There is a keyless entry and that is really nice.  There is also a security system that is on when you turn off the car.  If anyone tries to break in alarms go off.  This is very reassuring.  

Goodness, have I missed anything?  I certainly hope not.    

Overall, this is a great car, a bit pricey, but certainly worth the money.  I figure if we're spending this money, I might as well enjoy it while I can.  And, of course, you get <b>noticed</b> when you drive a Lexus.  Hey, they ooze luxury!  Most people we know drool over it when they see it.  They never ask how much we pay for it though.  I'm sure if they knew, the drool would cease.  But, if you've got the money go for it.  It is one of the nicest SUVs on the market.  I like it better than the Mercedes ML430 that we test-drove before this Lexus
