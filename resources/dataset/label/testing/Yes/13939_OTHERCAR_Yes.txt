            I got the Outback from my Dad who bought it new in '98.  It has since seen a whole lot of action.
 - With a towing capacity of 2000lbs. it has pulled a 2000  pop-up camper more than 3000 miles. Including a tour through Colorado's Rock Mountain roads.
 - It's been a daily driver since 2001 putting about 80 miles on the car every workday until Jan '03
 - Backed into in 1999
 - I spun it into a Poll in Feb '02.
 - It's riding fine at 83k miles and I expect another 100k be for it bites the dust.
And more other stuff that I can't recall at the moment.

This car gets all my love just for having All Wheel Drive!
This car's AWD has saved my butt so many times (but not every time as mentioned above).  But every time the tires have slipped EVER it was b/c of my own stupidity.  When driven properly in any weather I have never once lost control.  The Automatic Transmission shifter design (PRND321) makes driving in the snow much more fun.

One thing on tires though. All the AWD in the world couldn't get my OB up the street in the snow on those Stock 4-Season Tires.  I recommend Michelin X1's.

This cars horizontally-opposed style 4-cylinder engine is very odd to look at but is very cool for power.  It isn't a Corvette mind you, but when I need to tear out of an intersection it backs me with the goods.

The Legacy Outback has a very tightly wound engine making engine braking very useful, but when brakes are required the four-wheel disk brakes with ABS stops you quite quickly.  

As mentioned it is quicker then the average 4-banger wagon, but you pay for it with the gas mileage.  The H4 boxer style engine plus AWD seems to take the mileage down to b/t 18 and 22 MPG, on the other hand I've heard of Outbacks getting as good as 27 MPG.

This car has a very tough "OffRoadish" suspension. Which when the curbs are high you don't bottom out.

Whats inside!(the interior)
I gave this vehicle a 4 for roominess strictly b/c I'm 6'4" tall. Any person of average size would find the car extremely comfortable, even in the back seat.

The suspension of the car is tough as mentioned but where it helps in performance it hinders in ride quality (200 miles of Hwy driving will make your rear end hurt).

The plastic interior is cheap looking.  The center console arm rest is hard black plastic and is very uncomfortable.   The climate control and Stereo system lighting is nearly non-functional.  Most of the tiny bulbs that light the numbers and symbols have gone out.  Even the display panel of the Stereo head unit doesn't light up.  The Stereo only pushes 80W of sound through junkie paper speakers.
