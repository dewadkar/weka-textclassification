            After 5 months of pure fun, its time to write.

Outside:

The nissan Frontier XE king cab, is more than just a truck. Its a car that has been turned into a truck. The styling of the 2000 frontier is stylish and will stand the test of time. The 2001 "NEW BODY" is a little on the cheap and plastic side. I would opt for the older 2000 look. The 2000 model carries a chrome bumper that looks sharp. The hood is slightly tilted and sport's room for fog lights. The Rear lights are also tinted and look stylish.

Inside:

The inside of the frontier is great. It has good leg and headroom. The controls are well placed and easy to reach. The radio is also positioned well. The seats are very comfortable, but the rear seats are hard and extremely small. Even kids could find the seats a pain in the you know what. 

Under the hood:

The nissan XE has 145hp. The engine is built to last. Power is also more than enough (for the average commuter). 


On the road:

The nissan frontier handels like a car and is great at any speed. The interior noise is very low and road feel is great. The steering can be a little numb at times. Overall the ride is better than some cars.
