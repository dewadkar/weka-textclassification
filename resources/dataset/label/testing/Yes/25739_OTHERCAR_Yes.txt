               I bought a New Beetle. No, not really. I mean that was part of the process, yes, but actually something much larger happened. I entered a club,adopted a family, embraced a philosophy. We pass other New Beetle drivers and in both cars smiles fill the faces. We wave to each other, sometimes just a little one-hand-off-the-wheel salute, sometimes large arm-waving-enthusiastic greetings. Few others on the road could understand the sense of belonging and togetherness. Maybe that makes me a lemming, but I'm a happy lemming! : )
 
   It began months before the actual purchase, when the advertising gurus made me like the car, want the car, NEED the car. Glossy brochures made their way to my coffee table, hip and spunky ads drilled the images home in my unconscious mind. Drivers Wanted. Then I visited the web site, found the fan group, and ultimately downloaded the screen savers. It was happening, and had taken on a life of its own. I succumbed to the looks (which you either LOVE or think is UGLY as sin). I was also attracted to the safety record, which is one of the highest for its class. We weren't willing to pay over sticker for it so we had to wait a few months to get exactly what we wanted.

   We finally picked up our '99 Beetle on May 5, 1999. The time since has been wonderful. I love the handling, the room, the comfort that is surprising for a small car. I read a review that thought the trunk was a little small but I haven't experienced that. My husband and I were able to pack very heavily for a two week trip across country to a New Beetle only car show in Roswell, NM, using the back seat for only pillows, snacks and cooler. Keep in mind we brought car cleaning supplies, laptop computer, bags of clothes and several cameras with us!

   We had a problem in the beginning with the ABS light not shutting off, but that was an electrical problem that was eventually diagnosed and solved. I have had a wonderful time with my dealer and service departments, but then again, I got to know them pretty well while I was waiting for my car to come in and have brought them home made cookies. Others have had problems with other dealers in my area. I would suggest that you not let a particular dealer keep you from owning this car. 

   As with any model, there are lemons. And I think it is awful that a few would spoil the good name of all - that would be a shame. I have heard a few stories, but in most VW has made it good and bought the lemon back and offered a new one for a fair price. When my ABS light was still not diagnosed after 2 visits, my sales rep promised me a brand new car if they didn't find and fix the problem in a reasonable amount of time. That's why he gets cookies! : )

   This vehicle is fun to drive, draws a lot of attention, makes you smile on a Monday morning when you have to go to work (which is priceless to me), makes you an instant member of a club (I don't see Escort drivers waving at each other and meeting to talk about their cars) and is a safe smaller car. The engine comes is several options, and the interior can be nicely upgraded to heated leather seats, sun roof, etc. Along with the car, I found a new circle of down-to-earth friends. And German engineering has a lot of quality.

   Don't buy this car if it will be your only vehicle and you have to haul lumber. Don't buy it if you have three or more little kids (small children should ride in back due to the airbag and there are only belts for 2). Don't buy it to haul 3 tall teenagers either (the back window slope would cause a very tall person to stoop a little). My other car is an SUV, so we have something rugged and big as well. Don't buy it if you don't like people and don't want to talk to strangers or wave at kids.

  Buy the New Beetle if you would like a zippy little car with good gas mileage. Buy it if you have nostalgia for a classic bug. Buy it if you want something instantly recognizable that isn't like anyone else's sedan.  Buy it if you want something to make into a sporty car (the aftermarket for extras is extraordinary) or into something silly and fun (black spots on the red one, hot-rod flames on a white one, model cars in the back window, stuffed animals on the dash). Drivers Wanted. Drivers Found.
