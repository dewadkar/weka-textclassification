            My brother recently purchased a 2000 Hyundai Sonata. I was quite surprised that my brother purchased a foreign car let alone a Hyundai since I am die-hard fan of big American luxury cars, especially Cadillacs. 

I must say that Hyundai has come a long way from it's 1985 American debut. I remember a time when I considered Hyundais the second worst car to the unlamented Yugo with styling nearly as atrocious as their reliability. That has all changed. 

My brother desperately needed a new car. His 1989 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue were getting on in years. He was originally in the market for another Chrysler, but found nearly $27,000 for a fully equipped Cirrus extravagant. He found that even Plymouth Neons would've cost nearly $20,000 for what he wanted. $20,000 for a Neon? Are they nuts?

My brother's Sonata is a fairly attractive car. The styling is a quantum leap from Hyundais of the past. The back end of the car is particularly striking. Its pearl white finish with gold trim option almost makes the car seem Lexus-like. At $17,000 he got a lot of car for the money: power windows, seats, and CD-player. What was even more amazing was the almost unheard of .9% financing. The 100,000 mile ten year warranty makes this car seem even more attractive.

What I didn't like was the interior materials. The plastic materials used still reminds one that you are still in a low-priced Korean import and the fabric on the cloth seats isn't very attractive and doesn't seem very durable or resistant to stains. Some of the switches have a chintzy feel as well.

I don't know what the future holds for my brother's new car or Hyundai in general, but I wish him the best of luck. Hyundais of the past seem to have a spotty reputation and I'm not too thrilled about the four-cylinder engine in my brother's car. I would've opted for the V-6. Anyway, Hyundai certainly seems to be going in the right direction and in my opinion is the best choice among the three Korean makes available.<br><br>
