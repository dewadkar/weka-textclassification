               A Mercedes Benz S-Class sets the standard for all other luxury cars.  The top of the line S-Class cars are models of driving excellence.  With personal experience driving both an SEL-560 and an S-420, along with other brands of luxury cars, I can say that there is no comparison.  Performance, comfort, durability, and every other aspect of a luxury car are all first rate with cars such as these.  An S series will go well beyond 300,000 miles easily.  They are cars which are meant to be driven, especially for long distances.  They are a pleasure to drive with interior noise very minimal, and other amenities such as seat heaters and top of the line BOSE audio systems.  Owning a Mercedes S class enhances a persons simple joy of driving, something which no other cars can do.<br><br>
