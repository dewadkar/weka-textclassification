            As strictly a Ford family we have had the most success with our work truck,A Ford F250 7.3 diesel.This truck has been put through the paces on our busy dairy farm-hauling hay and calves,hauling 55 gallon drums of oil,and hauling countless pieces of machinery.All without a moan or groan or visit to the repair shop.This truck is definitely a heavy duty work truck offering the driver the ease of smaller trucks but with much more power.The truck is full of all the usual options including power windows and locks,standard or automatic transmission,and extended cabs,to name just a few.The motor is built alot heavier than a gas so you will be able to maintain a higher mileage if necessary.The F250 offers a heavy duty suspension although this large truck rides a little too stiff for some riders.This truck is a little better on mileage than a gas engine but is better on traction probably due to its heavier motor size.<br><br>
