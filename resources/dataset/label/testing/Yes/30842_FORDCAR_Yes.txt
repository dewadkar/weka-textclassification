            About 2 months ago or so, we got ourselves a Ford Explorer.  I will never again go back to a regular car again!  It's only a 1991, but I tell you, that thing has been the best vehicle we've ever owned!  It's opened up a whole new world for me and my husband and our 3 young kids.  We now can all ride comfortably, and we can pack everything that we need into it.  We went grocery shopping, and none of the bags had to go at my kids' feet!
We live in Nebraska, where MOST of the winters are pretty nasty - and we're 7 miles from the closest grocery store - the 4 wheel drive is a dream come true!  There is virtually no rust on the vehicle - which sort of surprised me since it is a 1991.  The gas mileage was MUCH better than I EVER expected for a truck.  That's what we call it - &quot;the truck&quot;.  We
get about 20 miles to the gallon, which is what our Taurus did! (That was a 1990 - crappy car.)
So, if you're thinking of an SUV - check out the Ford Explorer - I really love mine!
