            I was coming to the end of a lease on my '97 Eclipse, and I really had no idea what kind of car I wanted next.  I considered all of the options...truck, suv, sports car, etc.  I finally determined that I wouldn't break my string of 4 sport coupes in row and went hunt for a good one.  I had considered another Eclipse, but I'm not a big fan of the new body style whatsoever.  It reminds me too much of a Grand Am.  So I was leaning towards the Mercury Cougar.  It was a good car, but I couldn't find one with all of the options that I wanted.  I decided to stop by the Acura dealer, thinking that the Integra was going to be out of my price range.  To my surprise, it had the same sticker as the Cougar or Eclipse, but was leasing for about $100/month less.

To make a long story short, I did some research, and decided to buy a used Integra.  I got a '97 GS with all of the options.  I had a hard time not getting a VTEC, but every time I pass a gas station now and see the price of gas, I'm glad I don't have to fill up with premium.

The car rides great (for a small car, of course) and handles even better.  It rides the smoothest of any car I've ever driven when pushed to 90 mph and higher.  The acceleration is good for a 1.8 liter 4, but it's obviously not going to beat a Mustang GT, although you won't be left looking stupid.

One of the best things about the car is it's incredible gas mileage.  I average just under 30 mpg in the city, and about 34 mpg on the highway.  The biggest downside is the stereo.  Very disappointing for an upperclass Honda, although it does have all the ingredients to add your own bumps to it like the six speakers and standard CD.

Also, contrary to the belief of some cocky SUV drivers, the Integra handles superbly in the snow.  The ABS work great and it has a little bit more ground clearance than a lot of other sports coupes.  The only complaint is that you can't slip and slide when you want to.  That's no fun.

I have recently have had a couple of small problems with the Racetegra.  First of all, I had to replace the battery.  After more than three years, it was time.  I have also had two problems that occured only once.  First, the ABS light came on while driving.  The brakes were fine, but I read in the manual that the ABS don't work when the light is on.  The next time I drove it, the light didn't come on and hasn't come on since.  The other problem I encountered was that it idled too low once, almost to the point of stalling.  I revved the Racetegra up and started driving, and haven't had a problem since.
