            I purchased my Integra new in July 1997.  I bought the GS model which has all the toys including leather, sunroof, 15 inch alloy wheels and everything else other that the V-tech engine available on the GSR model.  I drove the GSR model (which I loved), but unfortunately, the dealer only had it in Red and without leather.  So I opted for my Black GS.  I must say that since day 1 I have loved this car.  Everyone who has driven it has said the same.  It is now October 2002 and I have put over 110,000 miles (175,000KM) on this car with absolutely no problems.  The car drives as well as the day I drove it off the lot.  The 140HP engine which is standard on the GS model in an absolute gem to drive.  My car is outfitted with a manual transmission with 5 gears plus reverse.  It may take a while for some drivers to get used to this vehicle as the engine has most of its power in the higher RPM range and it loves to be revved.  It has incredible power for its displacement.  I have driven Ford Escort ZX2's, Sunfires (cavaliers) as well as numerous other foreign and domestic vehicles and there just is no comparison.  Another beauty of this car is that the styling really did not change until the introduction of the RSX in 2002.  So you can pick up a used 1997 in good shape, and save yourself quite a few bucks and look as if you are driving a 2001.  Now for the complaints (all very minor).  The back seats are quite small, but that can be expected of a car of this size.  However, as long as you are not 6'1 or taller, you should have no problem sitting back there for a few hours.  Besides, who are you buying the car for, you or your friends?  The factory stereo, which came equipped with a CD player was a joke.  Spending $500 or so replacing the head unit and speakers will make an incredible difference.  I have installed a $6000 audio system and the acoustics in this car are fantastic.  My other minor complaint is the cup holders which are placed under the stereo.  They will fit a medium sized McDonald's cup as well as a can of Coke, but not much else.  The holes are too small for most glass bottles or anything "biggie" sized.  The glove compartment could also be a bit larger as there isn't much cabin storage room.  Those are my only complaints on a otherwise perfect vehicle.  
The car has a cavernous trunk which will facilitate those of you wanting to fill it with speakers and still have room for your golf clubs.  The steering and response of the car is incredible for a car in this price range.  The car is very stable at high speed.  I usually cruise at 90-100 MPH thanks to a Valentine One and unsuspecting Canadian Police and find that the car feels exceptionally stable (I don't recommend speeding).  I have driven this car very hard and have had absolutely no problems.  Acura maintenance is a bit more expensive than that of Domestic dealers.  But overall, this car will require many fewer visits to the shop than its domestic counterparts.  Overall costing you far less money.  The only maintenance I have done to the car are for normal wear and tear, brakes, plugs, tires etc.  Buy this car, I promise you won't be disappointed!
