            Someone at Office Depot may have been fired last fall, but we got ourselves a great deal on this camera!

For years we held back on buying a digital camera, thinking there was little need to have one, especially at the price. Then one day we were shopping for a new monitor and printer, and I could hear this one call to me. Clearance! Real cheap! I couldn't resist the draw any longer. In case the display was the last one left in the store, I instructed my husband to hunt down some help, because this baby was coming home with me! 

With the FD-73, the highest resolution is 640x480, not much compared to some of the 2 + megapixel cameras now available. All this really means is that you can't get photo quality prints from images on taken with this camera. However, the image quality means very little when looking for jpeg size images to add to websites, or to share with family and friends through email. 

The Mavica FD-73 has a 10x zoom, which takes a little practice to master. With the 2&quot; LCD screen on the back, though, you can easily view images from the 3.5&quot; drive, and decide right then which to keep (and which to can). With the copydisk function, you can copy your photos onto another 3.5&quot; disk, an inexpensive way to keep family updated on how that new baby is growing. 

Most of the options are very accessible on the back of the camera, my only problem that I keep hitting the zoom button when trying to snap a picture. (Oops) Other features include a flash, and some interesting editing options such as &quot;negative&quot;, &quot;sepia&quot;, &quot;solarize&quot;, and the ability to take black and white shots.

All of this is powered by a rechargeable InfoLithium battery, the smaller size of which comes with the camera. We have found we can take about 50 shots, on &quot;Fine&quot; mode with flash, on each charge. When the camera is on, the screen shows how much estimated battery time you have left. Sony was thoughtful enough to include an auto- shutdown, which turns the camera off after a 3 minutes of non-use.

The biggest selling point for the Mavica line is that you don't have to purchase the quite pricey little smart cards to store images on. A few boxes of 3.5&quot; diskettes and even you can add photos to your website- almost instantly! On the negative side, the resolution is nowhere near what is available on some newer models for sale, and this camera is larger than most, at 4&quot; x 5&quot; in size. 

We have found this camera to be a ideal for us, since we only use the pictures for emailing and our website. I can even attest to the durability of the model; while waiting to see Santa arrive last year, my husband dropped (!) the camera on the ground from about 4 ft, into a small puddle. Barely even a scratch, and it has worked without a glitch.
