            I waited a long time to get into the digital photography field and I am glad that my first camera was the Toshiba PDRM70. What a fantastic camera. This camera produces pictures that will rival just about any 35mm camera that is out there. Just after I purchased it I took it on vacation and my pictures I took were exceptionally good. And no waiting for film to be processed. They were there and if I didn't like what I saw, I simply discarded it and shot another right on the spot.

I have no complaints with this camera whatsoever. The battery holds up good even when using the flash and it recharges right in the camera. Although it is a good idea to carry a spare, one took care of my one days shooting without any problem.

The sharpness of this camera and the Canon lens is simply great, to put it lightly. I have seen other photos from other digital cameras and this one will do as good if not better. And the ease of downloading them via USB is fast and no need for a card reader. It's just beautiful.

If you are looking for 35mm quality from a digital camera, look no further than this Toshiba. And the price is right.<br><br>
