            Not long ago I sold Kia Sportages at a local dealership.  I was one of the representatives that actually liked this little SUV.  

The Kia Sportage is a good vehicle for someone that wants to get an SUV but doesn't want to pay a huge sum of money for a lot of features they don't need.  I usually recommend the Sportage to young and/or first time buyers.  It's a good little vehicle that gets good gas mileage, has low maintenance costs, and is fun to drive.

You've probably seen the ads on TV with all these people acting nuts, driving over embankments trying to get a good parking space, and the like.  Seriously though, the Kia Sportage can do just that!  I once had a young girl drive over the curb, onto the grass, through a ditch and around a parking lot of a local grocery store to prove to her it could do just that!

With it's peppy little four cylinder you will see a good amount of horse power and low cost per mile for the sized engine it is.  Unfortunately you will see minimal towing capacity.  If you want to tow anything bigger than an eight foot boat, I recommend a different kind of SUV.  I think that is one of the areas where the Kia Sportage is lacking.  Most people like SUV's because of their towing capacity and if that is what you need... that is not what you will get with a Kia Sportage.  

One of the other points where a Kia Sportage is lacking is cargo room and passenger capacity.  Yes, it is a little SUV so no, you will not get five adults and all of their luggage into it comfortably.  Although, surprisingly, it does have good leg room for the rear seat passengers.  

With it's low cost the Kia Sportage is also a good way for people to start out with a good SUV and not break the bank!  

So if you have no children, and no need to tow anything, I recommend the Kia Sportage for you.  It's a good first vehicle for young couples or singles alike.  If you need towing capacity, and lots of room... look elsewhere.<br><br>
