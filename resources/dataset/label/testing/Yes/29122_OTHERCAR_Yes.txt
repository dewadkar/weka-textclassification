            Last year I leased a 1999 Toyota Tacoma extended cab 4X4. I have had it a little over a year now. I feel that's plenty of time to discover any faults or flaws in a vehicle. Usually you will notice any troublesome characteristics much sooner than that! This is the third Toyota truck I have had. Over the last 10 years of ownership I can count on one hand the times I had trouble with them. In all cases the problems were minor (speedometer became disconnected,adjust tension on some belts,ect!) I should say I'm not easy on trucks either. I don't drive them like you see in the commercials but I do a lot of hunting  and fishing which by it's nature lends the truck for abuse! During the 10 year period mentioned I spent a substantial time in northern NY. Winters up there can be unbearable! It was nice to know that no matter how cold it got that I could rely on my Toyota starting on those bitterly cold mornings! The Tacoma was able to survive everything that I was able to put it through!

As I said I am completely content with my Tacoma however I do see a few areas that they could improve on to keep their competitive advantage! One is factory tires! Two of the Tacoma's I've owned have come with Dunlop rubber on them. For some reason these tire just don't seem to be able to take the pounding that is inherent in truck ownership. The Tacoma I own now has Goodyear Wranglers on it. I have noticed the difference already. The problem is that all the dealers seem to put different tires on their trucks. No consistency there! The seat comfort has improved over the years but still falls behind some other manufactures in comfort. The last issue I had was price! The price on these vehicles has risen drastically over the last 5 years! I did test drive the Nissan Frontier before leasing the Tacoma. Overall it is not as good as the Tacoma but the price differential between them could make someone think twice about the Tacoma. Only my excellent past experience with Toyota prevented them from possibly losing a customer. If the current pricing trend continues I may reconsider my opinion in the next 3-5 years!

All things being equal this is the best compact 4x4 you can by! The quality, reliability and durability are unmatched in it's class! Just ask some of my friends who have owned the others. It's an awful cold walk to work in January in upstate NY!
