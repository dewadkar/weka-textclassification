            After checking out many reviews on this camera and comparing it to other models before purchasing, I decided on taking the plunge into digital photography with the Finepix 3800.  I use a Fuji S2Pro for work, and loved using the Fuji brand, so that also helped in the final decision on whether to buy a Nikon or Fuji camera.  For the price, this 3800 has lots of neat features, with my favorite, the 6X zoom.  I bought it at Buy Digital Direct, for $349, along with a special $169 package for an extra 128 MB XD-card, a lens cleaning kit, 8 batteries with a rapid recharger, AC and car Adapter, a UV lens filter, a Vidpro digital Cam case, and a $70 5 year warranty.  With the shipping charges, I had a complete set up for $612.  A little more than I had budgeted for, but since I wasn't sure about the reliability of the camera, I opted for the warranty.

I had no problems with the lens cap like the others, but I don't use the adapter ring unless I need the UV filter, so it fits right on the front of the camera.  When the adapter ring is on, then you can't use the lens cap.

Focusing is a little hard though when using the movie mode function.  But when taking stills, I've learned to take several photos to be sure to catch at least one decent shot, and then review and dump the images I don't want to save.  It saves pretty quick for 3 MB.

Flash features are cool.  I used all different ones for different indoor and evening settings, and sometimes you don't even need the flash, and it takes better photos without it.  This camera is good especially if you have the time to take more photos than you need.  Since I've had that luxury for most of my shots, I love using it.  I often keep my regular film camera around for the shots I definitely don't want to get messed up, and don't necessarily need right away, that I can enlarge for my design projects, but this camera still gave me what I needed to complete a few brochure projects, and to be able to show to people right on the spot who wanted these images for their websites.  

The only problem I've run into is that I've had problems connecting it to my computer so I can download the images and movies.  For some reason, the computer recognizes the camera is there, but doesn't offer me the disk so I can move things to my computer.  Hard to find contact info for Fuji in the package or owner's manual.  Need to go online for help.

Also, the shutter lag for the movie is longer than the still photos.  I have a second or two of feet, ground and sky in my photos because the camera still records even though my finger isn't on the button.

Everyone who sees the camera thinks it's cute!  It's small and light, and is lighter than my compact Nikon 35mm camera, but bulkier, so you can't drop it in your purse without it taking some space.  Probably would need to opt for the thinner models if you're concerned for space.  If you don't mind tugging along the case, you can fit everything in it that you need.  I put it all in the case, and then packed it in my backpack to take on my plane trip.  Airport security had to take everything apart to see what was in there, but that's the way things are these days.
