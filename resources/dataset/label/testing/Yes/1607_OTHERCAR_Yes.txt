            Back in November, I realized that my car wasn't going to last much longer and set out to buy a new one. I tried my different models and finally settled on the Chevrolet Prizm. 

I was at first hesitant to buy a Chevy,but the dealership I went to was great. They did not put any pressure on me,always returned my phone calls, the saleswoman even stayed late because my husband didn't want to miss a football game.

The Prizm is a very nice car. It is small,but still has a lot of leg room in the front. THe leg room in the back is not as good,but if you have primarily children in the back seat,it is not a problem. The car has all the standard equipment,child locks if you need them. It handles very well. I have been driving on some icy and snowy roads the last week and I did not skid at all.

I would highly recommend this car as a good family car. The price is very reasonable. I am very glad I bought this car and would definitely buy another one.  <br><br>
