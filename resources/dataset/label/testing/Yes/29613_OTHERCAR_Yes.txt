                We had just had our second child and decided that our Honda Civic was just too small for our growing family.  We were originally looking for a station wagon. We ended up test driving a 1997 used minivan fully loaded and that's all we needed. We were sold.

    We got the 99 Quest and have been very pleased with its quality, performance, smooth and quiet ride, and child safety advantages. I really love the corner headlights with how it lights the whole corner before you turn into it.  I have trouble driving at night and this is a tremendous help to me.  I also love all the configurations you have with the seating. 

    We got the SE sports van with the sunroof, the Rear Air conditioning which is GREAT for the kids and other passengers.  This model even came with the VCR/TV like they even had to add that!  What a bonus...  The CD Changer has beautiful sound quality and really makes the ride very relaxing.  In fact, when we first got our van, I kept falling asleep at the wheel because the ride was so smooth and quiet.....My children cured that...... :-)   

    I have to say, there is one thing I don't like and that is when you turn the air conditioner on sometimes, it sounds like a big &quot;THUD&quot; or Clanking noise, I have told the service people and they said it's suppose to sound like that.  Just waiting for it to break or something to get satisfaction on that one.  This is definitely a family vehicle.  Very kid friendly.
