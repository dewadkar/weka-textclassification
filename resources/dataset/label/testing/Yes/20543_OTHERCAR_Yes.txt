            The Integra Coupe is a very nice looking car.  However, I will ask one question.  Haven't everyone seen this car enough on the streets?  Every I look is some sort of Integra.  The color of this car is usually silver around where I live, a color that has been quite popular.  The exterior is very appealing however the interior's comfort may be a bit on the negative side.  Driving this vehicle requires no skill at all because of its nice handling.  When seated in the driver's seat, the feel of the car is optimized by its low position.  I would recommend this car to anyone but rest assured that the consumer would not mind seeing the exact same one everywhere you go.    <br><br>
