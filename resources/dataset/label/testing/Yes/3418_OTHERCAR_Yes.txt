               In January, 1999, I decided to purchase a new car, after nine (9) years.  In that I live in New York city, and infrequently use my car, I did not know what to select.  I went to the Mercedes dealer, and, selected the CLK 430.  Love at first site, and, the test drive sold me.  I particularly enjoyed the smoothness of the engine, the power, and the sleek &quot;bullet-like&quot; looks that the MB has.  The features (both comfort and technology) are top notch, too.
    My concerns, however, was that the car would not be durable enough, and that the car was too small.  I also had in my mind to order a black car.  When I test drove the silver car, I realized that the size was ok, and the color silver is perfect for that car.  Thus, I ordered it, and my baby was delivered April 16, 1999.  I had some concerns about having a brand new car in the city, but the first dent in the garage eliminated that fear!  
    As for the car, after one year, I have only experienced two problems...1.  the dashboard emits minor squeaks, and 2. the tires are magnets for pot holes and nails!  It is still powerful and sleek, handles well and I am satisfied with my purchase.  If you have any specific questions, please feel free to e-mail me.
