            I bought my 1992 Honda Prelude as a used car in 1995.  At the time it had about 30,000 miles on it.  I'll be honest, I was just a young college freshman at the time and  the main thing that attracted me to the car was it's looks.  It had everything.  It has a very sleek style to it that still looks new - even though it's almost 10 years old.  I get lots of compliments on this car and no one can believe that it's a 1992!  It has a CD/tape player/radio.  It has a sun roof and a spoiler.  Power everything!  It just looks "cool."

Well, six years and about more 110,000 miles later, I've gotten more out of this vehicle than just good looks.  My Honda has been an awesome car.  Until this year, I had no maintenance at all besides normal wear and tear.  It never broke down!  I had a warranty when I bought the car that I never used once.  The Prelude handles really well and is super easy to drive.  You get a smooth ride out of this car.  The thing I love most about this car is that it gets great gas mileage.  I know all Honda's do, but it's still a big plus!  It's great on the highway and also in city traffic.  The interior is really nice; it wraps around you and sort of has a cock pit look to it.  It's really nice to have a sunroof in the warmer weather and it's isn't too noisy to drive with it open.  As far as safety goes, I have been rear ended once and survived!  There is a driver side air bag that, fortunately, I have never needed.

As far as space and leg room go, this is not a family car!  The back seat would be okay for small kids but it's hilarious to watch an adult try to ride back there.  And to be honest, as much as I like driving my car, I don't mind not always being the "taxi" for my friends!  There is a pretty decent trunk space and an average size console between the back seats.  There is a very slim small glove compartment that doesn't hold much, just my drivers manual and insurance information.  The only thing I would change on this car is there is no cup holder.  And there is no way to hook one on the door because they have a think, rounded shape.  It's pretty challenging to drive and hold a Big Gulp at the same time.  

This year I had two things go wrong with my Honda for the first time ever.  I had a problem with my fuel pump and also with my air conditioner.  For some reason, all of a sudden my car wouldn't start on the first try.  It would start after just 1 or 2 more attempts but I took it in and had the fuel pump worked on.  And about the same time this happened, I started having a problem with my A/C.  Sometimes when I would push the A/C button, it wouldn't blow cold air.  I had that repaired as well and have had no problems since.  I figure about $1000 worth of maintenance on a 9 year old car in 6 years of ownership is pretty reasonable!  

And that's why I am always telling people, "I'm going to drive that car until the wheels fall off of it."  Which doesn't seem like that will be happening anytime soon.  I know someone with the same make and model that has over 200,000 miles on their Prelude!  And by the way, when the wheels do fall off... I'm buying another Prelude!
