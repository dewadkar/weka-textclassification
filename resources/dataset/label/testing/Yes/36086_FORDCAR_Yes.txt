            That's what I told my husband on our way into the local Ford Dealership, and until I saw the Focus, that's what I felt.  We were looking for a sporty loaded car, with room enough in the back seat for our twins car seats and an extra passenger.  We ended up leaving that dealership empty handed, but with alot of good thoughts about the Focus in our minds.  A couple of hours later, after checking out the Civic, Sentra, Saturn and  Grand Am, we went back, filled out the paperwork and left with an Atlantic Blue Focus SE. 

This was the first new car I'd ever bought, and frankly I was skeptical at first. I didn't see the point of paying so much money for a car when I knew the value would depreciate drastically as soon as we drove it off the lot. But after negotiating the price and the value of our trade in, our fully loaded Focus, with an extended 6 year 85,000 warranty only cost us about $13,000, a price that couldnt be beat.

The focus is everything we expected it to be. Its a very smooth ride with great handling. Every thing from the radio buttons to the side mirror controls were obviously well thought out and within easy reach of the driver. This car was designed for both sexes and any height.  The seat belt adjusts for taller and shorter people (great idea Ford!) The only disapointment Ive had with it so far is the air conditioning vents are placed in positions that make it hard to reach the seats in the back. 

Another thing I love about this car is the two trunk releases. There is one by the drivers side, where most cars have them, and there is another on the dash, below the far left air conditioning vent. This makes it very easy to pop the trunk when the window is down, without having to open the door again. Also the trunk doesnt 'pop' in the conventional sense. It unlocks and then sits there and waits to be pulled open (its easy to open) Also if you dont open it after awhile, it will relock itself. That sure gives me piece of mind when I cant remember If I accidentally pressed the button or not. 

Over all this is a great little car. Its priced good and has tons of great features. I wouldnt trade it for anything (well maybe a van, but only cause in a few years Im going to have two boys wanting to take their friends everywhere) I strongly reccomend this car. Oh and for all you people out there that like to fix your own cars (like my hubby the mechanic), this one is a piece of cake to work on. We havent had the need to yet, and I doubt we will for a loooooooonnnnnnng time, but everything under the hood is in an easy spot to get to. <br><br>
