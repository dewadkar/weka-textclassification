            My husband bought a brand new Geo Metro in 1992 , i jokingly called it &quot;our blue box&quot; due to its compact size.This is the greatest car we ever had !! We drove this car from Alaska down the AL-Can highway without any problem what so ever. We drove several times cross country and had not one problem or any repairs done in the whole 5 years we drove it !!Not to mention it is very comfortable seating wise and great if you have children or pets. If you drive in the city or in the country it is a great compact car and gets great gas mileage. One tank would last me 2 weeks !! The trunk/hatch space is incredible for such a small car and we even moved furniture in it !!If you are looking to buy a great car with minimal to no maintenance /repairs, i recommend this car highly. My son loved that car and it is great for beginning drivers too, as they are not intimidated by the size. I would have never given up that car, except that my son wrecked it :(.<br><br>
