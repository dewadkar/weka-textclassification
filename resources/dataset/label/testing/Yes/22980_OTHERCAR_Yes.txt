            I bought this camera for two reasons.  First, the price range was acceptable to me, and secondly, I wanted a camera that I didn't have to adjust all the time.  I don't want to have to focus and set a million different settings.  I simply wanted a quick and easy camera.  

<b>Why I like it</b>

Once I began fooling around with it, I realized how easy it is!  I use it all the time.  With four kids, I take a lot of pictures.  I love being able to delete ones that aren't so great; no more wasting film!  You just set a button for how far away you are from your subject, the resolution (the higher the resolution, the less pictures fit on your card), and choose whether or not you want a flash.  You can peek at your picture right away in the viewer window, and if you don't like it, you can delete it and take another one.  The camera has saved me lots of money in film processing fees, plus allows instant gratification of seeing the picture immediately.

Uploading to the computer is a snap. I have the floppy disk adapter and that lets me put the card in that and put it in my floppy disk drive.  It then is just a matter of opening the included software program and making a selection to download from the camera.  Your pictures are then stored in this program for future editing or deleting.  The options in the included editing software are quite limited, so I actually save the picture in there and open it with a different editor when I actually want to make a change to the picture.

I definitely would recommend the adapter instead of draining battery power from your camera to do this by just hooking up to your computer. 

I began using it not only for putting pictures on the internet, but for making printed pictures on photo paper.  You have to have a good printer to make them come out nice, so if you don't have a great one, your pictures won't look so hot, either.  If you won't use it a lot for online purposes and don't have a decent printer, I don't think you'd be happy with using a digital camera.

The printed pictures are acceptable but aren't superb, because this is not a mega-pixel camera.  When you look close, the pictures are grainy, but for my purposes it has been okay.  If I want to take digital pictures to print out and give to people, I would buy a mega-pixel camera.  

Since the majority of my use has been for internet use, I have been more than pleased with it.

<b>The downside</b>

As with all digital cameras, there is no &quot;film&quot; to take in for processing, so you can't get a professionally processed picture if you do have a great pose.  Depending on your printer, your quality may not be very great.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a mega-pixel camera.  It is for the more casual user, not professional use for occasions where great resolution is of the utmost importance.

<b>Summary</b>  

For my needs, this has been perfect!  A great combination of easy to use features and a low price tag, and still performing well.  I would recommend this one to my friends.<br><br>
