            If you know my reviews, you know that I get to the nitty gritty, what the average person really wants to know.  I am not a car expert, but I've had 3 jeeps, several mercedes, jaquars, Range Rovers, you name it.   I keep coming back to Jeep because it is what it is, and every review you read is going to dissuade you because they want it to be something else.

I read that the amazing Rubican is not to be driven on a regular road because it is so difficult, bumpy, etc.  This is sheer nonsense.  If you ever drove a jeep of previous days, and i mean 2001 and back, this Rubican outdrives them by a mile.  It is smooth, relaxed, easy, and total fun.  

The top goes up and down in minutes rather than tens of minutes.  It keeps the wind out, no flapping.

The engine is smoooth, fast, powerful---sure you want to go off road, but you won't!  I mean, this thing costs almost 30k---who's going to pay for the bodywork after your first outing?

So I admit it...i bought it cause it looks great and actually could climb a mountain if there were any that appeared in my way.  I love the big tires, the way the car rides high off the road.  I love the interior--especially the new fabric seats, way better than sticky hot vinyl.

The 5 speed shifts smoothly.  The stereo with those great new speaker pods overhead and the woofer in the counsole is powerful and refined.

This is the ONLY jeep to get if you can afford it.  The Sahara is also very nice but is a little too nice if you know what I mean. 

The Rubican is for reclaiming your masculinity if you've been driving one of those pretty little soccor mom SUV's like I've been for a few years.

So let me review the fine points:

DRIVE:  Very smooth, even the RUbican with those big fat tires.   It handles 50% better than any Jeep I ever drove.

TOP:  Easy up, easy down, quiet.

SHIFT:  Smooth, easy, doesn't get hung up.

CLUTCH:  Ditto, easy on the leg

ENGINE:  Sounds like it could move a mountain, but it purrs down the highway.  It means business but you can actually conduct business while you're driving.

COSMETICS:  It looks awesome.  I love the Rubican decals, the diamond metal protection panels.  This is the real thing and it looks like it.

EFFICIENCY   Lousy, like all SUV's...can't really figure out why something so small and relatively lightweight gets 15 mpg at best, but I'll live with it.

COMFORT:   These ;new seats are fabulous.  They are as comfortable as those on my volvo stationwagon.  

VALUE:   I think the Rubican is the best value even though it's a few thousand more than the Sahara. First, if you really intend on serious off-roading, the extras cost less this way than as add-ons. Second, they only made 8000, so there will certainly be a solid demand.

If you love jeeps, you'll adore the Rubican.  If you think |Jeeps are no good cause they don't drive like Range Rovers, you probably aren't reading this anyway!
