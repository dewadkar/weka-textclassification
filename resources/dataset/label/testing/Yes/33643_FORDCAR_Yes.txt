            Let me first start off by saying that this car, despite others' opinions, does not perform like a sports car.  To the ZX2's credit though, it can be bought for as little as a quarter the cost of a sports car.  I just thought that needed to be cleared up first, I have organized the rest of my review into specific sections.  Keep in mind that I am about to list every minor issue I have with the car, everything else not listed performed well.

Performance:

Like I said above, this car is not a sports car nor does it pretend to be.  It has 130 horsepower powered by a Mazda Zetec 2.0L engine.  This engine will accelerate the car quickly and power it easily up to 106 mph where the governor will hold it at a constant speed.  With the automatic transmission, it is nowhere close to redlining when it is at 106, but the Eagle tires are only rated for speeds up to 120 mph.  A chip modification can be ordered to remove this restriction but that would seem unwise before changing the tires.  Speaking of modifications, the only available performance modifications I have been able to find for this car are the chip mod mentioned before and a hi-flow air filter (I use K&amp;N).  As far as handling is concerned, the car handles well, though the other cars in its class are smaller and lower to the ground, giving them the advantage.  Turning radius is superb, I can turn the car around in the width of a neighborhood street without having to back up.  Brakes I imagine would perform better with ABS.  My car does not have ABS and I have found that locking up the front tires is exceptionally easy when panic braking or when braking on ice.  Expect the rear drums to start squealing at about 20,000 miles.  This is because dust accumulates in them.

Interior:

The ZX-2 interior is fine if you are riding in the front seat.  If you are riding in the back seat and you are taller than about 5'2&quot;, you will be cramped, which is normal for cars of this size.  What is not normal about the back seat is the extreme difficulty of ingress and egress.  While most coupes I've seen have seats that slide forward when the release lever is pulled, the ZX2's seats just bend forward.  The interior is appointed in plastic and has a radio/AC console that is integrated into the same plate.  This makes changing the inferior radio cost an extra $40 for a plate that will fit it.  The center console is a joke, there are two cup holders that will hold all but the tallest or fattest drinks, but there is no storage bin between the seats, just a 2&quot; x 4&quot; tray that is about 2&quot; deep.  The cup holder located just behind it for the use of passengers in the back seat is a little too shallow to hold anything but a small drink very well.  The complete lack of above-door handles makes for a very interesting ride with a fun driver.  The seat belt retractors do not work at all if the belt is twisted and the hard plastic belt buckle can rest between the hard plastic seat release and the soft plastic door.  This has resulted in two large holes in the inside of my door.  I am 5'10&quot; and have no problems fitting in the front seats.  The trunk is large for a car of this size but the mouth of the trunk is too small to fit large objects into, despite the fact that they would fit inside.

Exterior:

The ZX2 looks very aerodynamic and sporty.  More often than not, it is mistaken for a Probe.  The &quot;sport&quot; package adds a spoiler which completes the look of the car, but adds an idiotic looking stripe down the side.  The exterior body is make of six pieces which are expensive to repair when dented.  The radio antenna is non-removable and easily damaged by a car wash.  

Safety:

Did well in front crash tests and side impact tests for rear seat.  Failed side impact tests for front seat.  Dual airbags standard, ABS optional, side airbags not available on 1998 model.

Other Observations:

The stock sound system is incredible, it can get loud enough to drown out most other sound before distorting.  If you opt not to get the &quot;power&quot; package, you still get a remote keyless entry tag but it only works on the driver side door.  Fuel needle will read empty when tank has over four gallons left.

Mileage:

I don't know what the EPA says but I have found that in traffic I get between 24 and 27 mpg and on the highway (avg speed around 70) I get between 28 and 31.  The car runs on unleaded 87 octane gasoline.  I have tried running it with 93 octane and it reduces the gas mileage slightly.
