            This year, Lexus came out with a brand new vehicle.  The IS300, Lexus' attempt to combat the overwhelmingly successful 3 Series BMW.  Has Lexus been successful so far?  Some people think so, while others do not.

While the IS300 has been a rare sight for some people in some areas of the country, I personally know 3 people who own this car.  I have driven my best friend's yellow IS300 several times and have ridden in it countless times.  The car is beautiful, has a stunning interior, and has good performance.

<b>Performance</b>
The IS300 has an inline 6 engine which produces about 215 horsepower.  The car can hit 0-60MPH in about 7.5 seconds.  Not blazing speed, but definitely respectable.  The handling of this car is great.  Several times, I have been in my friend's IS300 on back roads.  Put the pedal down around long winding roads and you will definitely have some fun.  You can get going over 60 MPH around curves in the road and feel completely in control.  When I drove the car, I was surprised at how sensitive and tight the steering wheel felt.  This is good, in my opinion, because you feel completely in control of the car even at high speeds.  The fastest I have been in the car was at 115 MPH, and the car seemed to be handling it with ease.  It was extremely smooth and felt as if we were going about 80.  Manual transmission is not available in the IS300 as of now, but look for it to be in the future.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior is most people's favorite feature of this car.  Leather and swade seats provide great comfort.  The stereo system in the vehicle is outstanding, and the 6-disc in-dash CD player is a nice addition.  Racing pedals and a very cool shifting knob gives a nice extra finish to the interior.  The only negative in this car is the fact that the back seats could use a little more room.  Leg room is a little cramped in back, but other than that, you could practically live inside this vehicle.

<b>Appearance</b>
The appearance of this car some people view as uncharacteristic of Lexus.  The car definitely has a more sporty look to it, and I think it suits a younger person as opposed to older adult (I know 3 people under 18 who have this car).  The exterior colors available are definitely unique.  Bright yellow, a super sonic blue, and auburn red are some of the colors available.  The blue is definitely a beautiful paint color on this car in my opinion.  Who would have ever predicted a 4-door YELLOW Lexus Sedan?  Anyways, this can hardly be called a sedan, but rather it should be called a sport sedan.

<b>How it compares with other cars</b>
This car was definitely engineered by Lexus to combat the Audi A4 and mainly the 3 series BMW.  Many BMW fans appreciate the manual transmission option which is not available in the IS300.  The 3 Series BMW is actually a little less expensive than the IS300 and outperforms it as well.  Lexus has definitely stolen some customers from the 3 Series market, but I think they have some more work to do.

<b>Conclusions</b>
Bottom line, the IS300 is nothing short of fun to drive.  You can hit high speeds and take corners with ease.  Cars that can handle are the most fun to drive in my opinion.  Keep the pedal down and you can really get moving, up to 140MPH I believe.  The ride is extremely smooth and comfortable.  The style of the car is pure sweetness.  The IS300 is a great new vehicle for 2001.  Check it out.<br><br>
