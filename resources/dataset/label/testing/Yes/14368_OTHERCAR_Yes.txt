            After my wife's car was totalled by a drunk driver, we went searching for cars.  After 4 days of endless test-drive and fending off the 'sharks' we finally decided on the 2000 Nissan Altima.

It makes me wish MY car had been totalled!  Very roomy in both the front and back seats, even for a big guy like me.  The trunk can store at least three bodies without crowding.  Very smooth ride!  Even though it is a 4 cylinder, it has more pep and acceleration than most V-6s I test drove.

Great gas mileage, low road noise, an oil filter you can actually reach to change :-), awesome interior amenities...I could go on forever.


Just do yourself a favor and test drive one.  You will love it!!

Not a bad price either - we talked our dealer down to $15,500...
