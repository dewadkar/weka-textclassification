            Many automotive journalists have already lauded the 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan as the best sedan in the world.  And after only four days with this car (I wish I had it for longer) I find it very hard to disagree with the majority.

This new top sedan brings even more luxury, refinement, and convenience from the multi-award winning S-Class family.  The new 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan marks the debut of the newest MB power plant.  That being a 362 hp V-12 engineered to provide effortless thrust with an uncanny ability for overall refinement.

Honestly, the car almost feels like an electric car on steroids in it�s torque delivery.  This next-gen engine also amazingly provides better performance and higher gas mileage in one fell German swoop.  This high tech engine has a broader torque band than the engine it replaces and it also promises a 20% increase in fuel economy.  

At first though that 20% value, seems almost inflated.  (That is a lot of fuel if you think about it.)  But that is what Daimler-Chrysler reports and in my limited time with this car, the number seems a bit overrated.  I should mention that as compared to the relative few other V-12�s I have driven/tested this engine was definitely the most frugal in terms of premium petro consumption. 

This engine can propel the hefty sedan to 60mph in just over 6 seconds.  WOW.  Bottomline--the engine is stronger than anything else in any other luxury sedan out there period.

Each 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan will feature Mercedes� highly acclaimed ABD active suspension, high polish 17-inch alloy wheels, dual exhaust, a trunk mounted CD changer, active ventilated and multi contour heated front seats, integrated digital Motorola TIME-PORT telephone, and the ever so soft Nappa leather upholstery.

It should be noted that the 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan can also be had in a sport package that adds a slightly more aggressive, silhouette while maintaining the unique S-Class grandeur.  The sedan also comes equipped with large, 4-wheel vented front cross drilled disc brakes with enhanced ABS.

As with other big Benz�s this model can come equipped with �Brake Assist� which can reduce braking distances in panic stops.  Nice.  This feature from what I can remember is rather unique and was tested by a 3rd party university lab in Canada and the system came out very well in reducing the overall distance in panic braking.

Out of all the interesting luxury features the 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan has the one that I found the �coolest� was the dynamic multicontour front seats.  These units are worth every penny.  They really are comfortable.  I thought the seats in a caddy were the most comfortable �till I tried these.  Even the rear seats feel just as good as the front ones.

The seats feature an innovative active ventilation arrangement that incorporates 10 (yes 10!!!) small fans through the seat bottom and seat back.  These fans then circulate fresh air through the seat cushion to draw off perspiration in hot weather.  Nice.  I know Caddy offers a similar feature on their automobiles but these one on the 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan seem to work better and faster.

Overall, the 2001 Mercedes Benz S600 sedan is one formidable car.  It really strives hard to do everything well in every single aspect of human pampering, in terms of overall automobile refinement.  I personally wish that this car was a little bit cheaper, or maybe some of the technologies found in this car could make their way to cheaper models.  A good example of this is the innovative �Brake Assist� feature.

But the brutal truth is that this car will never become cheaper because the people who want this car could care less if the price was double the current MSRP.  People who can afford it really do not care about the price.  And that�s the bottomline.
