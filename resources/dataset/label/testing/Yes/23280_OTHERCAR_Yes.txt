            I�m a 23-year-old college student with a pretty decent job.  I live in Hawaii and despite what &quot;Mainlanders� may think we do a lot of driving down on the island.  Especially on our congested H-1 and H-2 freeways.  I bought the 1998 model and it has served me well ever since.  Lyala, the elantra and I are quite happy.

The Pros

The elantra was a great choice for me it fit in my price range and with the extra guarantee I felt pretty safe as a female with no automotive experience about taking care of this car.  The air condition works well.  It is easy to drive,  and park due to its compactability.  Large spacious trunk.  Good visibility out of the side windows and the rear.  Pretty affordable for younger owners.


The cons
I have learned to love Lyala for all her faults and have accepted her ways�However if you are planning on buying the Elantra you may want to know the following:

1. DINGS:  yes they are inevitable and Lyala does have her battle scars but I believe that the Elantra is more prone to getting dings and bangs because of the car�s design.  The side doors and panels curve out slightly and the small guard plate/strip is placed under the outpouching leaving the sides prone and vulnerable to DINGS.  I�ve looked at other elantra�s in the parking lots and WE ALL GET MAJOR DINGS.

2. TURBO BUTTON:  Bet you didn�t know the elantra has a turbo button.  The truth is that is doesn�t however when I drive up RED HILL or any hill with the air conditioning on I have to push the turbo button (AKA air conditioning OFF button) in order to gain extra power to get up the hill.  MOMS AND DADS if you don�t want your kids speeding around the Elantra may be what you�re looking for.  There is some power to this car but if you have AC on full blast and expect to step on the gas and go you better make sure your not jumping infront of a speeding truck or WHAMMM.  

3. GAS UP CHUCK:  Unfortunately Lyala doesn�t know her limits.   When I feed Lyala too fast she tends to spit up.  In other words for some reason when I leave the gas pump on and let it fill up till it clicks off gas will spill out of the tank, leak down the side, down the tire and onto me and my shoe.  Not really graceful!!  I always have to watch the gallon counter at the gas station she can handle about 8-9 gallons with out hurling it back onto me.

4. HOT:  The rather large windows that make viewing soooo easy also cook the driver.  I am saving up to by Lyala some shades (AKA tinting)
