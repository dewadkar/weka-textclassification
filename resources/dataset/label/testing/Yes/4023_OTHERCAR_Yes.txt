            The Chevy Tahoe is one above the rest, It is by far the best looking SUV. I have not been lucky enough yet to own one of these beautiful beasts, but i will soon enough. I did however get one as a rental for a trip I went on for a few days. Before I went on the trip I berely knew what a Tahoe was, after the trip I could not stop talking about how great it was and how much I wanted one. 

The inside is roomy, and the seats are very comfortable. It is great for trips because you can fit everybody in comfortably and still have room in the back for luggage and whatever else you need. It drives very smoothly, it does well on corners, and it has lots of POWER! 

The Tahoe is kind of expensive but it is definitely worth the money, There are a lot of different options that come with the tahoe, so the price range can very a lot. I can not say enough good things about the tahoe, and if you don't believe me, just go test drive one or even better rent one at a car rental place and take it on a trip. Your mind will be made up after you get back. 

Definitely a car for families. I would recommend the Tahoe to anyone looking for a SUV or a family vehicle.
