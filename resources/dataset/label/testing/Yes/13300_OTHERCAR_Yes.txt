            I have used this camera for the past 3 years...  I am a professional Photographer, and use digital mostly.  As a professional, this is a wonderful option, especially for sports photography and photojournalism.  Portrait Photographers may want to stick with film, or opt for a medium format digital back, which provides more detail and a larger ccd.
This has so many options, I don't know where to start.  The most valuable to me has been the firewire link to my Macintosh computer.  I just hook it up, turn the camera on, and the computer's automatic peripheral recognition system knows it's a camera, and asks me where to send the images to.  
As with most (if not all) digital cameras, this camera has the option to change light sources, which is so much easier than having to buy different types of film.  It is so like a normal manual camera, but can also be set to automatic, which  works best for quick situations, as in sports.
The ttl focus feature is great, and the fact that it uses all of the Nikkor lense made for nikon is even more perfect.  
It has a regular sync cord port, and can be used just like a film camera for studio or field photography.  I've shot everything from landscape to portrait with this, and it works great.  
The price for this camera does not include the price for lenses, so when buying this, plan on budgeting about another $600.00 for a good 28-80mm zoom lens.  
You can also shoot using the AC adapter, which is great for when you're in the studio.  Batteries usually last about 1 memory card (set on high jpeg), if you use the lcd screen to view every shot.  
You can use the NEF format, if you have the plugin to open that file, but i choose not to.  
This is too much camera for me, but i really love it, anyway.  If you like the idea of the D1x, but want to spend less money, you can go for the d100, which is more of a prosumer type camera, with less features, but great quailty.
