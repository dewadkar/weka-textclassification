            My fiance and I decided that it was time to buy a new car.  Unfortunately neither one of us have any kind of credit.  I mean zero.  Mazda was the only one that was willing to work with us.  They have this program for first time buyers with no credit.  Of course, you have to make enough money.  My interset was in the middle single digits and I didn't have to put much down.  My payments are great.  The car has a pretty smooth ride.  It's kind of low so you feel some of the bad road.  It has plenty of room in the back.  I love the glow in the dark release panel in the trunk.  God forbid someone gets stuck, they can pull the panel and let out.  The standard cd player is awesome.  I can't say anything bad because it's a great car for the price.  The fact that you don't have to purchase AAA is great.  They have there owe off road assistance.  Now that is cool.  I would recommend this car to all first time buyers and anyone who wants a new and awesome car without breaking you pockets.<br><br>
