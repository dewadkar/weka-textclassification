            I purchased my 1999 Plymouth Neon "Expresso" over a year and a half ago now.  It was my first car purchase, and it has made me extremely happy!

The first thing that caught my attention with the Neon was the external appearance.  I looked at several cars, not concerned with price, and the Neon was the most physically attractive car I managed to find.  It was love at first sight.  It's a relatively small car, but actually looks somewhat "sporty".  Mine has a rear spoiler, premium wheel covers, and is "Deep Cranberry" in color - almost a reddish purple.

The outside of the car was beautiful, but I loved the inside too.  The fabric is very cool -- Mine is gray, with cool colorful designs.  It gives you an "at-home" feeling.  My neon has sliding power sunroof, which is absolutely wonderful.  The light coming in from overhead is great - I could never drive a traditional, dark, gloomy car again :-).  In the winter the sunroof can make the car a little colder (cold glass), but you can actually pull closed a sliding door under the glass to virtually make it like a car without a sunroof.

Here's my only complaints about the car's interior:
1) The cupholders are somewhat "under" the ashtray.  You won't be able to fit anything taller than a 20 ounce bottle in them.  And even with a 20-ouncer, you can't open the ash tray if you have a cup in them.
2) It can get cramped.  I'm 6 feet tall, and I can sit very comfortably, don't get me wrong.  But I can't have anybody but a very small passenger sit in the back seat behind me, because my seat has to be pushed so far back.  If you're looking to cart around 5 tall people, this car isn't for you ;-).  It seats 5, technically...but unless 2 or more are small children, I'd say 4 at the most.


The car drives really nice.  It gets decent acceleration and nice speed for a 4 cylinder!  It handles very very well, and I've maneuvered myself out of quite a few tight situations in traffic.  No accidents for me and my Neon :-).  It can get a little bumpy at times, but only on rough roads - and only because your butt is literally probably a foot or two off the ground :-)

It gets great gas mileage, too.... I average probably 22 city / 30 highway.

My Neon has been reliable for me.  The Power Sunroof died on me - and that was a $250 repair.  The only significant trouble it gave me, was a Head Gasket Problem.  It caused an oil leak, and THAT was an $800 repair.  I've heard it's a fairly common problem with Neon's 99 and older.  Mine was covered under an extended warranty I purchsed with the used car.  If you buy one, check into it -- if the head gasket hasn't been replaced already, I highly recommend an extended warranty of some sorts.


All in all, the Neon is a wonderful car.  It's not a "luxury vehicle", but it's attractive, reliable, somewhat sporty and just plain fun.  I HIGHLY recommend it for a first vehicle, or for a vehicle for a middle class small family.  I encourage you to test drive one - it's really a lot of fun.  And picture yourself on one of those old billboards that just said "Hi.".  They're cute :-).

A cute vehicle, unbelievably reasonable price, and an all in all great car ;-).

One more thing...the factory "Premium Sound" system sounds great - I love music, and didn't replace a single speaker ;-).
