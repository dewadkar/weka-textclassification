            This was my first crack into the world of digital pictures. I was looking for a fully functional, easy to use and reasonably priced camera; and I found it in the Kodak DC240. The High resolution pictures 1280 x 960 are crystal clear when displayed on a 17&quot; monitor and the output even on plain paper printer on a HP855C looks realistic from 2 feet away.

<b>Camera Features:</b>

The camera has many useful features, but using them, especially reviewing the pictures thru the 2 inch lcd display, puts a serious drain on the batteries.

The camera comes with 8 batteries, 4 our rechargeable with the included recharger. I would recommmend buying 4 more rechargeable batteries and switching them when you swap out your memory card.


The camera comes with and 8 Meg memory cards which is easy to insert. Unfortunately at high resolution, you will only get about 17 pictures before you have to delete or copy them off to other media.  But, if you select the medium resolution (640 x 600), you can get approximately 54 pictures. This is the best resolution for emailing pictures anyway. Therefore, the 54 pictures are are like having 2 and 1/2 rolls of 24 exposure film.

<b>Interface with Computer:</b>

There are two interface cables to choice from. The serial cable is acceptable, but if your PC is equipted with USB; (use it) USB appears many time faster on the download of pictures.

<b>Software:</b>

The Kodak Easy picture software is not the greatest. It takes a while to load and does not have many editing features. It does allow you to store photos in a gallery format, which make it easier to find later. I would recommend using a product like EasyPhoto, which is truly easy.

<b>Conclusion: I would recommend this camera. I plan on getting one as a gift for my father. I have seen this camera listed for as high as 599.00, but with a little research on the internet, I was able to chop off 200.00 and got a great deal at 412.00 dollars. (buy it)</b><br><br>
