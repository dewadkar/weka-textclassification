            I leased my 2001 Sportage EX as a replacement for a 1995 Dodge Dakota. We have 2 vehicles, and I drive mine 50km per day from a rural area into the city and back. Snow is a big factor here in Canada, and gas prices in the Atlantic region are outrageous! 

I looked at many smaller SUVs, and then drove the Sportage. I wanted something with some options, but most offerings I looked at were priced way too high, and most dealers simply wouldn't deal very much at all. 

I was able to lease the new Sportage completely loaded for thousands less than anything comparable, with a .42% lease rate (yes, point 42%!) and with a 5 year 100,000km power train warranty, I felt some measure of security. (I had already replaced a $3,000.00 transmission on a '97 Voyager that was just barely out of warranty at 75,000km � so warranties are important to me).

I have had all manner of vehicles over the last few years: cars, minivans, a full-size truck, an SUV, a compact truck, so I believe I am quite realistic in my expectations for this vehicle.

First of all it is a truck � albeit a small truck � built on a truck frame, with a solid rear axle and full-range 4 wheel drive. It does not have the supple car-like ride of car-based SUVs like Rav 4 or CR-V.
But then I've never owned a 4wd truck that did. 

It will, however, take you to some pretty nasty off-road places where you'll never find a car-based SUV.
I have taken my Sportage up some very rugged trails which would have stopped my Dakota. The short wheelbase and small overhangs make for respectable offroad ability, and low range allows you to crawl over rocks and mud with plenty of grip. Driving in the snow is great!

I do recommend substituting the KUMHO tires before you buy the vehicle. The OEM tires are designed to give a smooth on-road ride, but are not great for snow or off-road use. I replaced them with Michelin LTX M/S truck tires which, though a little noisier, are much superior for all-around use 

I enjoy the all-leather seats, great visibility, the power options, the CD stereo system, and the gas mileage. The truck is fun to drive, and easy to park. Since it is our "other vehicle", I don't need it to do everything. The Sportage has plenty of room for our family of four on short trips, but we usually use our '99 minivan for extended trips requiring lots of luggage and gear.

On the negative side, I think more power would be good � as long as it is not at the expense of gas mileage. The liftgate/tire arrangement is a pain, but the surprisingly generous interior room is worth the hassle. 

I have driven my Sportage about 11,000kms (6,500 miles), and the only problem so far was a loose aluminum heat shield (which has happened to every truck I've ever owned � no big deal), and a plastic door trim panel which needed some adhesive replaced on one spot. So far so good.

The Sportage handles like any truck/SUV. It is small, light, and high, and bouncy, and stiff � like a truck. Drive it like you would any 4wd truck and you'll have no problems. I think that because the Sportage is cute, small and sporty, some folks expect it to drive it like a Honda Civic. Get over it!
