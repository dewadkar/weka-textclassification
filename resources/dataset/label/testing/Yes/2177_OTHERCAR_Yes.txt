<TEXT>
            I bought my Toyota Corolla in September 1996, only days before Hurricane Fran hit the Carolinas. (This is relevant later!) I had been looking for a replacement car for some time, to replace my decade-old Ford compact that was dying. 

My first reaction was that for what you get, the Corolla costs too much. The base cost of this one (manufacturer's) was around $13,000 US, and that's before the dealer markup. This is not a bad price, until you notice exactly what is considered &quot;optional.&quot; The AC, the radio, even electronically adjustable side mirrors were optional. While these might appear to be normal &quot;options,&quot; I consider them essential for my driving safety. 

Once I test drove it, however, I changed my mind. I ended up buying it and it has weathered a number of storms, both real and metaphoric. 

Comfort
The Corolla's interior is comfortable, with spacious seats and comfortable legroom. Too many cars require that the driver be skinny or uncomfortable. I do not like the idea of being incredibly uncomfortable when I'm driving. There is also ample space for passengers of almost all sizes. The Corolla is also a very quiet-running car. When I stop at stoplights, I can barely tell that it's running. It's nice to have a car that doesn't require me to play my music over the sound of the engine. 

The bad news was that without all the options I wanted, creating the right driving environment is hard. Since the mirrors are not electronically adjustable, I have to roll down the window on each side and change the settings manually. This has to be done before leaving the driveway and it's hard to do, particularly with the passenger-side mirror. Since the windows were not electronic, I could only lower the driver's window when driving. That means cross-breeze is not available unless I have passengers. 

Durability and Resilience
The first test my Corolla passed was the hurricane. When Hurricane Fran came through North Carolina, a tree fell down right on my brand-new Corolla. This might seem like a bad omen, but I decided it was not. The only damage was cosmetic. My Corolla ended up with three dents: one on the roof and two on the back driver's side door. None of these dents were even large enough to fit my thumb into, which was impressive. This showed me that the Corolla is a very resilient car and durable to withstand the weight of a full grown tree with only a few dents.

Safety
The next test my Corolla passed was the safety test. After I had my Corolla for a while, I ended up in a wreck in one of those horribly designed mall parking lots. The other guy was going 45 MPH (in a 15 MPH zone) and rammed me on the right-side front door. While it certainly wasn't pretty, the Corolla's crumple-zone technology kept it from being a massive medical mess. The door and front fender crumpled in, keeping the truck from demolishing the body of the car. The repair was easy. This same kind of wreck in my last car would have almost totaled the car. 

In the long run, I decided that for me the Corolla was a good match. However, I would not recommend it for everyone. If money is an issue and you are a good driver, get something more economical or go to a dealership with very low overhead and haggle your heart out. If you really want a safe and durable car and don't mind the extra money, get the Corolla.<br><br>
