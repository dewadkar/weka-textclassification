            A sophisticated V-6 significantly changes the personality of the import-fighting 1999 Olds Intrigue sedan... @$21,175-$24,945 Intrigue's new 3.5-liter, 215-horsepower V-6 gives this four-door the response and feel of some of the best foreign sedans with its smooth, high-rev design. This front-drive model needed such an engine to compete with autos such as the Camry and Accord. The quick, precise power steering has decent road feel but is too light at highway speeds, where less power boost would provide surer control. It's nice to see Olds losing an inferiority complex caused by low sales early in this decade that caused it to hide its name on some models.
