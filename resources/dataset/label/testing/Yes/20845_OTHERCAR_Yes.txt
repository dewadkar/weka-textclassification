            Test drove the Prius January 3, 2001.  I am 6'2&quot; big framed.  Found the car comfortable, very tight and had no trouble in traffic or on the tollroad. It takes some getting used to with the gear lever on the dash and you move it towards you and down or up watching the display on the top of the dash.  Display is in the center of the dash and in the power mode is distracting.  You have to get used to braking on the car.  Above 5 MPH the car uses the breaking to generate recharge as soon as you hit that 5 MPH slowing down, it releases and you are free wheeling.  It is sort of like you had let up on the brakes.  I guess you will get used to it over time but I had to be concious of this in traffic because you get a small surge forward. Found it worth the price and ordered one.  Problem for me was dealer related.  The dealer wanted an exorbitant deposit with delivery in June or July.  Yet, I was trading in a car worth used over 50% of the purchase price.  Went to a second dealer and it was handled professionally. Still delivery in June or July.

Probably the best buyer for this car is one who would use it commuting as it is not going to get the mileage advantage for long road trips as you would be on the gas engine the whole time.  I am going to use it for my in-city driving.<br><br>
