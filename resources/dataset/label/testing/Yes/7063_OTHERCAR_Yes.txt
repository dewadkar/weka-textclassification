            I bought this camera in June of 2000 and have used it constantly since then without any problems.  I traveled a lot this summer and the small size was convenient.  I took photography fall term this year and used this camera and got photo quality results for 8x10 prints with the resolution of the camera.  People would pass by and see my picture next to one someone had done in the darkroom and not even realize the difference.  I have fooled around with or used most of the features which I'll now go through..

When the camera is turned on the lens cover opens and the lens comes out. The circular display reads hello!. It will then show the battery life and show the mode, amount of pictures left, flash settings, and zoom.  The mode can be changed by rotating a circular knob on top.  The modes are setup, video, continuous shooting, manual, auto, portrait, landscape, and night photography.  

Auto mode is great for beginners.  All they would have to do is zoom in or out and decide whether a flash was necessary.(the camera has a pop up flash) They can take it with or without the LCD screen.  In manual mode the white balance, exposure, flash, and sensitivity can be adjusted. Portrait, landscape, and night photography modes are self-explanatory.  Most of the time I usually leave it on manual for portraits or landscapes and it has worked fine but I always kick myself for not have changing the mode.  

I've used night photo mode for my night photo assignment and it worked well.  Since the shutter is open for longer you'll need to use a tripod to make the image sharp. For some of my pictures I purposely  moved the camera to create streaks of light and it worked just like a manual camera would have.  

Another plus is the macro lens which also came in handy for one of my assignments.  The assignment was nature abstracted and we had to shoot from odd perspectives.  With the macro lens I was able to really zoom in on things and see textures.  

I was really surprised by the video. I've only used it for videos ranging from 2-15 seconds but they have been pretty sharp and have had surprisingly good sound.  

Playback:  Playing back pictures is done by flicking a switch.  You can go through pictures, play videos,   view a slideshow, delete pictures, protect files, and resize image resolution.  It's all pretty easy and the slide show has a variety of transitions which I thought was cool.  

The only con of this camera is using the LCD screen drains the battery much quicker which is pretty much inevitable no matter what camera you buy.  The solution?  Carry extra batteries! It comes with 2 NiMH batteries but I recommend buying extra sets. I have a rotation of 3 sets of batteries which works well for my usage.  In a bind you can use 2 AA batteries but they won't last very long.  

Another thing is that to my knowledge, Fuji doesn't make a carrying case for this camera.  I just went to my local photo store and found a case that was a perfect fit made by the brand Tamrac.  Until I found that, I just used a soft cotton drawstring sack from an airline that once held toothpaste etc.  I'd recommend having a case or some kind of protection. I've also heard some people complain that the buttons were too small but I personally thought they were fine.

In conclusion I think this camera was one of the best investments I've made and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera that's compact and/or high res under $1000.  I hope I covered everything and please feel free to email me about any further questions @ ashie3@inorbit.com<br><br>
