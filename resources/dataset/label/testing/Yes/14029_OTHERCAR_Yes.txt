                 My mother bought me the Pontiac Sunfire because I needed a safe car and she heard many good things about it.  I have to say that this car is extremely safe and very reliable.  My Sunfire gets great pick-up speed and the ride is always smooth.  I used to drive another car not made by Pontiac and I was never really satisfied with it.  The Sunfire has made me very happy.  
    I think that the person who could buy this vehicle is a college student because Pontiac makes it very affordable and they offer different packages at reasonable prices.
    I have a CD player and a sun roof in my car and I love it!  The sun roof allows me to enjoy nice days without spending so much for the convertible top and I can listen to all my music during my trips.  Both the cd player and the sun roof came in a package together.
    The only thing that I don't like is that I wish they offered more in their packages.  If you want to get power windows and power locks, that is in a separate package from the sun roof and cd player package.  If they could put them together, I believe that it would make things easier for the buyer.
    The color of my car is red.  In my opinion, I think that red makes the Sunfire stand out!  I have gotten nothing but compliments on my Sunfire and I always get stopped about it.  People always want to know how I like it, how much did I pay for it, how it runs, etc. and now i just told all of you! :)
