            After 11 years with my old Nissan truck, it was time to renew.  I was looking for an American-made compact truck with more room, conveniences, & power than I had before.  I shopped around the used truck market but finally decided to buy a new 2001 2WD Ranger Supercab with the 4.0 V6 (208 hp) & 5sp Auto.

In this configuration, Ford laid out the truck with 4 doors, cruise, tilt, air, dual media stereo (single CD & cassette with 4 speakers), electric mirrors & windows, electric locks with remote, 4 wheel abs and chrome wheels.  I bought the truck in Toreador Red with a Grey interior.  I did not like the tan interior at all (too bright).

Do you want to burn rubber?  The more powerful 4.0 V6 (208 hp) is chock full of power & torque.  It is fast from a red light and can change speeds on the highway quickly.  It might get me a ticket (lol).  I planned on towing my motorcycle trailer (3000 lbs. loaded) and the truck is more than capable of that.  According to the books, it can tow 5700 lbs.  The truck is pre-wired with a "flat 4" connector but you got to buy the Reese style receiver.  And stopping is not a problem with the fat tires & 4-wheel abs.

Ford did pretty well on their interior.  Gages are easy to read & controls are within reach.  The heater controls are very elementaryï¿½the manual does not need to be consulted to operate.  I have three personal interior gripes.  The radio buttons, though large & easy to read, could have been more logically arranged.  The front seat cup holder center console is a far reach (located on the floor).  And the seats could use more adjustments or something to make them more comfortable for the long haul.  Please consider the first two gripes minor/picky.  But the seats do need some redesign.

As far as ride, it is good for a compact truck.  It handles the bumps nicely at slow & fast speeds.  There is some wind noise at highway speeds.  I attribute it to the whole side of the cab being doors.  I like the fact that you sit high even though it is a 2 wheel drive truck.  It gives you a better view of the road plus you can see over some of the traffic ahead of you.

Ford continues to manufacture a market leader.  This is a good solid compact truck.  I recommend it.
