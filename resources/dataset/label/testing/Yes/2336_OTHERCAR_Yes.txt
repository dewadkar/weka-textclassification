               I enjoy photography and have taken photos for many years. I started selling items on Ebay and needed a tool that could give me good images, quickly and in expensively.  My single lens reflex can take great photos, but there�s the middle step of having the film developed and printed. I decided it was time to look into buying a Digital Camera.
  The Toshiba PDR-M4 is what I settled on. This little camera gives me the results I need. It has three different quality options, for end results, from high quality resolution to a down and dirty low resolution (for more stored images on the smart card). It�s small size and lightweight (� pound) makes it easy for me to carry on my buying trips. The Camera looks and feels very similar to my single lens reflex camera, which made me more comfortable from the start. It has a viewfinder and an LCD display for reviewing your shots or for use on close ups. 
  Another big selling point for me on this camera was the USB connection (for those of you with out a USB connection it also includes a serial cable). Having a USB connection quickens the download/upload time to my computer when I�m ready to send them to my hard drive. 
  So far I�ve enjoyed using this camera and it�s given me the results I needed, helping me sell more products on Ebay!
