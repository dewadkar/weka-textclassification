            There's no doubt about it:  The Jeep Wrangler and its 70's predecessors are the ultimate &quot;fun in the sun vehicles.&quot;  But before running to the lot and singing on the bottom line, here are a few things you might want to consider. 
1.  Which top is right for your climate?  
Soft tops in good condition do a great job of protecting you from the elements, and the heater in every Jeep I have ever been in has been fabulous, but once a top begins to wear and not fit properly or develop holes you may be faced with a problem if you live in a temperate or colder area.  Also, if you live in a very sunny and hot area, and your Jeep doesn't have air conditioning you'll want to invest in a bikini top or some other half top to provide shade.  Sitting on the freeway in 95 degree temperature and the sun beating directly down can ruin the Jeep experience.  
2.  Which top is right for your personality?  
To many people, myself included, the desire to own a wrangler originally stemmed from the desire to be able to cruise down the road, be it dirt or pavement, with the top off.  As a result I almost see no purpose in buying a hard top.  But, as with anything, there are two sides to the issue.  In my opinion the easiest way to break it down is this:  If you want a Jeep for off-roading comfort go with a hard top.  If you want a Jeep to function as an off-road convertible go with a soft top.  Some benefits and some detriments to each.  For example, hard tops are difficult enough to take off and put on that you will not want to do it on a daily basis. If you take it off during the day and it drops below about 60 at night you will be chilly (remember the wind chill factor of going 50 down the highway :)  Soft tops, however, can be very loud.  Yes, that's *loud*, something you might not think of if you've never owned a convertible before.  With time, the tops stretch and buttons fall off so eventually you have canvas flapping and metal clanging against metal at 55 mph.  It can be very annoying.  
3.  Why not get both?
Some of the newer style Wranglers offer dual-tops as an option.  This is obviously the best answer in most cases if you are interested in spending the extra money.  If you are not already sold on an earlier Wrangler or CJ you may want to consider going all the way and just getting a newer model.

With these points made, let me reiterate the point that with either top there are pros and cons and it is best to make your decision based on what you will be primarily using your vehicle for and where you live.
Happy Jeeping!
