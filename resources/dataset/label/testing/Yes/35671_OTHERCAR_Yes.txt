            My dad has the 97 version of this car, and I've been driving it a lot.  Damn that a nice car.  I'm sure in a couple years I'm gonna have to buy my own piece of junk car, but for now the infiniti I30 is a nice ride.  The drive is so smooth sometimes i don't notice how fast I'm going (which may be a problem).  But there is great traction and breaking for the winter time (I should know, it helped me avoid some bad collisions).  Also there is a fine Bose stereo system in this puppy.  If you want some sweet tunes while you're driving, this car has the stereo for you.  There is also a lot of trunk space.  With the lovely little flap from the trunk to the cab, you can store skiing equipment also.  Well, I don't expect you to go out and buy this car, but take it for a test drive, and see just how smooth it is.<br><br>
