            My parents brought the 2002 Camry LX model in October of 2001. They took me by surprise because they were in the market for a Corolla but I guess the dealer (who I bought my 2001 Toyota Rav4 off of (I have a review on that too)) managed to convince my father, because my mother was really looking forward to purchase the Corolla, to purchase the Camry. When they brought it to my job for Show-And-Tell they let me do a test run around the parking lot. I first noticed the pick up which was real nice and the handling wasn't bad. I couldn't really test it because my mother doesn't like crazy driving. The interior is extremely roomy and comfortable with the back seats having the ability to fold down to gain access to the trunk (which is also very roomy). I really didn't notice that much that day because I needed to go back to work and it was nighttime. 

The next day (while the sun was out) I finally got a good look at the car. It was a nice Blue color with Beige Interior. The Camry came with a Sun Roof, Six-Disc CD Player, Power Windows, Power Locks, ABS (which were not standard unfortunately), V6 Engine, cruise control, Remote Keyless Entry, no fog lights, no spoiler, and not so attractive wheels. I was able to take the Camry out on a test run (a good test run) and here is what I found: 

<b>Speed</b> 

The V6 engine that came with the Camry is not as strong as other vehicles that I've driven with a V6 engine in it. It takes at least 8 - 9 seconds for the Camry to reach 65mph, which is okay. A month after the car was purchased I was on Rt. 17 South and decided to really test the engine.  A 2002 Honda Civic pulled next to me so I revved my engine to catch the driver�s attention and we sped off.  I just edged out the Civic before hitting the next light about � of a mile down.  The driver was pretty impressed but I wasn�t.  The ride itself is very quiet; more quiet then my Rav4. The engine rarely makes any noise and the ride is very smooth even when we hit some nasty bumps. Overall I was very please with the engine of the car. 

<b>Handling</b> 

The handling of the car wasn't bad at all. I took the Camry to an empty parking lot, placed some cones some 30-40 feet apart and just began weaving between them. I felt like I was in complete control of the car at all times even though the car did slip at some moments (then again the parking lot was still wet from the rain that morning).  I was making some turns on the road at pretty high speeds and the car maintained itself quite well.  In the end I was very please with the handling of the car. 

<b>Brake</b>

I was disappointed about how the brakes felt. I noticed that I had to really press down on the brakes in order for the car to stop. I also noticed that when I placed the parking break the darn handle was nearly placed at a 90-degree angle when I pulled on it. I took the car to the dealership to have it checked but they said they found no problems with the car and the brakes are functioning normally. My father looked at it (he's been working on cars all his life) and even he was surprised to find out that, as weak as the brakes felt, he could not find anything wrong with the brakes on the car. I'm very disappointed that the ABS on the Camry is this weak. I don't know if anyone who has the 2002 Camry feels the same way. 

<b>Interior</b> 

I like the odometers for the Camry. It's got a cool retro look to them. The dials to reach the AC/Heater are all accessible and within your reach. The car has a lot of compartments to place your belongings. You can even access the trunk from the inside by pulling down on of the rear seats.  There is a lot of legroom in both the front and rear of the Camry.  I�m only 5�7� but I have friends that are close to the 6�9� range and they were very comfortable when I stuck them in the back. Usually they feel like they�re in the back of a police car when sitting in most sedans (that�s a whole different story).  The CD player allows you to insert 6 CDs. The one thing I found strange about the CD player is that you have to press an Insert button to insert a CD into the CD player. I don't know what's up with that. I also noticed during the end of the day when it got darker outside that the odometers, when you turn on your headlights, they are a nice metallic white color while the lights for the other gauges (AC/Heater, Clock, Automatic gear shift, etc) are green. That's the one thing I dislike the most about the interior.  I don't know why they couldn't make the interior lighting of the car just one color. Oh well! 

<b>Exterior</b> 

The body of the car is awesome. Toyota did a real good job in focusing the Camry on a younger audience. It's got a real sporty look and it's real easy for the car to clean. As a matter of fact it's the easiest car I've ever cleaned. The car is awesome looking.

<b>Final Thought</b> 
 
The car is an All Out Chill car. It�s roomy, sporty, and fast. I enjoy the drive and the seats make the ride comfortable, and all my family and friends love it.
