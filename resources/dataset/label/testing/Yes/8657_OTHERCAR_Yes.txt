            I have wanted to write this review for a long time now. <b>The Olympus Camedia C-700 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera</b> is the product that brought me to Epinions in the first place. I am by no means a photographer, although I have always loved to take pictures. As far as digital technology goes, I knew basically nothing when I began my search for a camera. I was looking for a good camera with some basic and not so basic features, and that�s what I found.

<b>Features</b>

<I>1.5� Color LCD Monitor</I>. This is something that I had to have when I was looking for a new camera. I wear glasses, and it was always kind of a pain to look through the little window. This LCD is big enough to really see what the picture is going to look like. You can also look through the black and white viewfinder, which does save on batteries.

<I>Display</I>. Whether you look through the monitor or the viewfinder, you get a display of these things: battery power, shooting mode, number of pictures remaining, and record mode. The battery indicator will blink red when you have about 10 minutes of shooting time left. There are seven different modes to shoot in, as I will go into detail below. The record mode determines the quality of your picture (SQ, HQ, SHQ).

<I>Built In Flash</I>. I have heard of some people that really don�t like built in flashes, but I�m not one of them. With the push of a button the flash pops up. When you are not using it, it is pushed down into the camera. I usually don�t like flashes like this, because it is more likely to break than if it was �built in�. I have found that this is usually because of the flash coming up electronically, but this one seems to be spring loaded.

<I>Seven Shooting Modes.</I> I�m no professional, but I probably take just as many pictures as one! I bought this camera about a month before my daughter was born, for obvious reasons (if you have kids, you know).  That being said, I actually find that I use most of these shooting modes, with the exception of one.

<I>**Auto**</I> This allows you to take still pictures. The camera makes the optimal settings for the conditions. I take almost all of my pictures with this setting. I have been very pleased. All of my pictures turn out really great. 

<I>**Landscape**</I> This setting allows both your subject and it�s background to be in focus. The camera automatically sets the shooting conditions. I used this setting to shoot pictures of a field by our house. It�s actually a meadow with a stream and mountains in the background, in Lake Tahoe. They turned out beautifully. These were actually some of the first pictures that we took. 

<I>**Sports**</I> This setting is for fast moving action shots. I have used this several times, with mixed results. It is supposed to shoot without blurring, but that doesn�t always happen. I have taken pictures of my dog catching a ball, and most of them still turn out blurry. The best results that I have gotten from this setting, are from a moving car. There was slight blurring near the ground, but very little.

<I>**Portrait**</I> This is great for taking portrait style pictures of people. It is supposed to focus on the person and blur the background. In most cases, the background has been slightly �blurred�, but sometimes I really can�t tell the difference. This might be due to my picture taking ability!

<I>**Program**</I> This setting allows you to adjust most of the functions manually. The only thing that the camera sets are the apertune and shutter speed. I use this, along with the portrait setting to take timed or sequential pictures.

<I>**A/S/M**</I> This allows you to have total control over the setting for the camera. I am not very familiar with these things, so have only used it a couple of times. In time, I plan to learn more about photography and can use this setting more often. 

**To change the shooting mode, just turn the little dial on top of the camera. Very easy.

<I>Movies!!</I>. This was one of the main reasons that I bought this particular camera. It allows you to take short movies, with sound. It is a really great feature, and very easy to use. There are two different recording modes for movies. SQ = 62 seconds of shoot time, and a lower quality video, which shows up very small on the computer screen. HQ = 15 seconds of shoot time, higher quality and larger on the screen. The movies are recorded using quicktime. I use both the HQ and SQ settings, depending on what I�m recording. Each movie takes up 9 pictures, no matter what mode you record in. 

<I>USB</I>. <b>The Olympus Camedia C-700 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera</b> comes with a usb cable that connects to your computer. There is no need to install any software to download your pictures. The camera is recognized as a hard drive, and all you do is open it up and drag your pictures out! 

<I>SmartMedia</I>. It comes with an 8 MB smartmedia card. If you plan on buying this camera, automatically calculate in the cost of another card. Why?
An 8 MB card holds: 1 TIFF, 7 SHQ, 16 HQ, 82 SQ. I bought a 64 MB card that holds: 56 SHQ, 128 HQ, and 664 SQ.
I have been sending my digital photos away (via internet) to get developed, and have learned some valuable information. At the SHQ and HQ you can get great prints up to 8 x 10. With the SQ setting, the best quality print is only up to a wallet size. If you are only going to be sending photos via e-mail, the SQ is fine, but for printing you will want to use the higher quality settings. The camera is set to the HQ setting when turned on. I have not seen much of a difference between the HQ and SHQ, even though there technically is.

<I>10x Digital Zoom</I>. This is one of the selling points of this camera. It�s hard to find digital camera with a big zoom. I have used this, and my pictures have turned out good, even without a tripod. 

<I>Mac and PC Compatable</I>

<b>Why I Like It</b>. 

What�s not to like? Just the fact that it�s digital is great. I love being able to see the picture as soon as it�s taken. I�m sure that I�ve saved a lot of money in film, considering I�ve taken hundreds of pictures of a moving baby. Needless to say, not all of them turned out. With this camera I can just click away. My daughter sees the camera coming and gets all excited. 

The picture quality is really great. I print out pictures up to 8x10 on my Epson Photo 785EPX, and they turn out great. You can't tell them from a regular print.

<b>What I Don�t Like</b>

<I>Lighting</I>. This isn�t a big problem, but it�s worth mentioning. I had problems with the quality of movie clips at first, due to insufficient lighting. Make sure you have plenty of light, and they will look great.

<I>No Remote</I>. It would be really nice if <b>The Olympus Camedia C-700 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera</b> came with a remote. It does have an auto timer, so we get buy.

<I>Small Memory</I>. As I stated above, you have to buy a bigger memory card.

<I>Heavy</I>. It is a little heavy, but not as bulky as some digitals.

<I>Blurring</I>. Pictures will turn out blurry if you don�t hold perfectly still. 
 
<I>Batteries</I>.  It does not come with rechargeable batteries. You will definitely want to buy a charger and some batteries (NIMH or other).

<b>OH NO!!</b>. Something very horrible happened about a month after getting this camera. As I said, I wanted to have a digital camera so I could take A LOT of pictures of my new baby. Well, we didn�t really have a good start. I learned all about this camera before giving birth, and showed both my mother and husband how to use it. I felt confident that it would take good pictures, so I took it to the hospital when she was born. To make a long story short, all the pictures got erased. I have no idea how this happened, because you have to push quite a few buttons to do this, but it did. I was obviously preoccupied, so I didn�t see what happened. Supposedly the screen just went blank. It is digital, so I guess these glitches can happen. It hasn�t happened in the seven months since, but just be warned.

<b>Conclusion</b>

I highly recommend this camera. It is one of the best investments that I have made. <b>The Olympus Camedia C-700 Ultra Zoom </b> is basic enough for the novice to learn, and advanced enough for someone with more knowledge to enjoy. It is well worth every penny.
