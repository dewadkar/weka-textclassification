            I leased this car in March of 1999. My other vehicle had been in an accident and I needed a new one. I liked GM vehicles and a friend of mine worked at a dealership so I went there.

 I would caution you that if you drive a lot of miles a year like I do a lease may not be a good thing. You will be required to pay for every mile over the total mileage that your lease gives you. This could be costly at the end of the lease.

 I will say that I liked the car right off because of the smooth quiet ride and the features. It had nice sounding CD player with controls on the steering wheel. The interior is very comfortable and it has plenty of room in the front. The back seat is a little more cramped but is acceptable. 

It handles very well and has enough power to get into traffic and accelerate. It also has pretty good fuel mileage for a midsize car. It is a great highway car that is fun to drive.

 The thing I am a little weary of is the handling in ice and snow. The low profile P225-R5016 tires are not very good in these types of conditions. I would recommend changing them for the winter months. The only real problem I have had with it is the wearing of front brake pads.

 On average I have to have then repaired every 5 to 6000 miles. I have an acquaintance who has the same vehicle and he stated that he has the same problem. I have always taken it back to the dealer for repairs and they have been good about it and not charged me for repairs even though the warranty on them has expired. 

I would recommend that if you buy this vehicle new that you get an agreement from the dealer to warranty any and all brake problems with the front. The trunk is very large and I like the split rear seat option. Overall it is a good vehicle.<br><br>
