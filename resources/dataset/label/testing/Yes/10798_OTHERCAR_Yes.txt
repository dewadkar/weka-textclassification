            My 1990 Buick Skylark has almost 200,ooo miles on it and is still getting me to my destinations.   I got this car at 16 for 3200.oo from the previous owner and it has taken varies abuse from wreckless teens and their friends to unkind smokers to neglecting owner and yet this beauty still goes.  
Now i have had plenty of problems, of course, with that mileage a car takes a beatin here and there.  I have replaced pretty much everything except the engine, carhborator and fuel injection.  This car loves me and I love it.
It drives unexpectedly well in winter on snow,   its gas mileage is decent, it is comfortable and it has roomy front/back seats and large trunk.  I have also been hit twice in this vehicle and have yet to seek repairs because the damage was so minor where another car may have crumbled or self destructed on the spot.
Now i have had my days,   quite a few at that    where this car has upset me and sent my stress levels unnecessarily high but through it all the buick has forgiven me for my impatience and i have forgiven it for its expected faults.
To this day i drive everywhere in it, it is my prime transportation and i trust it with mine and my daughters life.
I recommend this car to anyone who doesnt mind repairing a flaw now and then but who anticipates a loyal and sturdy transportation companion.  
Also my stereo has always been top notch and it is factory installed.   
Although on some functions i have to 'ghetto rig' to work,   this car is a keeper and when it quits someday and i am forced to move onto another one,  i may just keep this one around so i can cherish all the memories it has given me through my teen years into adulthood.<br><br>
