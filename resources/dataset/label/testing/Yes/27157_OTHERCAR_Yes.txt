            April 1, 1998 I purchased my Astro Mini-van after having had wonderful luck for seven years with a &quot;used&quot; Astro with over 150,000 miles on it.  It just finally bit the dust in the parking lot of Lawrence Marshall Chevrolet.

I asked my best friend Teresa to give me her cousin Don's phone number so that I could get him to go with me to make sure they were not going to sell me extra options.  I didn't have to worry because so many options were standard equipment with the exception of the car alarm. (By the way this is how Don and I started dating...with my calling him and now we are engaged...the heartbeat of America brought us together).

I purchased my mini-van because I have an In-home Daycare and there are enough seatbelts and room to easily buckle in the children as I am doing my school run.  To date I have less than 11,000 miles on it.  I took it to New Mexico in September 1998 and didn't have one problem with it.  It was very comfortable to ride in and I would highly recommend Chevrolet over any of the other vans available.

I paid $24,000 for my van and it still looks like it just came off the showroom floor.  I realize that sometimes we do get a &quot;lemon&quot; but I have never had any problems with my van.<br><br>
