            I am a small person, five foot.  But I needed a car that could do &quot;big&quot; things, like get around in the snow (I'm in WI) and haul the occasional piece of furniture or pile of lumber, etc.  But I still needed it to be a family car, since I have two preschool age children.  The RAV 4 excels in all these areas.

What do I like about it?  When I first bought it back in 1996, everyone who knew me said the car was ME.  And I agreed.  It rides like a car - smooth, not like a jeep or a truck (I test drove some of the other mini SUV's, so I know they don't all ride so smoothly).  It is a small car in length, so it fits almost anywhere, yet it has a decent amount of cargo space.  And even though I am short, I can get in and out of it easily, which I could not do in many of the regular sized SUV's.  After 3 and a half years, I have had NO major mechanical problems with it, it is SO reliable!  Even in below zero weather!  It gets decent gas mileage for a SUV, probably because of all it's car components (as opposed to truck components).  And of course, it's cute (now come on, everyone wants to like how their car looks, even if they don't always admit it!)

Some of the problems I have had with it: the turning radius is not the best; the head rests tend to push my head forward because of the way they are tilted; and I find that it does OK in snow, but it doesn't like freshly wet roads (probably because it is a light car).  Of course, I should mention that I do NOT have the 4-wheel drive version, and mine is a manual transmission.  Finally, I have two car seats in the back, and with those two seats there is very little room to spare; so I doubt you could fit 3 people back there comfortably.

But those things are minor in comparison to all the benefits I have found owning my RAV 4.  I LOVE my Toyota!  And I recommend it to anyone who asks - and they ask me a lot. :)<br><br>
