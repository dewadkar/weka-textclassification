            I was driving a Dodge Neon for about three years and decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted to stay in the Dodge family so I started looking at the 99 Neons, but the Avenger caught my eye.  The moment I sat in it I knew this was the car I was going to buy.  The seats are very comfortable and spacious.  The sound system (CD player,cassette deck, 8 speakers)is excellent!  
There are a few drawbacks...First is the location of the CD player.  It is too low and close to the shifter.  Second, the car is very low, so you have to be careful and drive slowly when going over any bumps.  Third, the rear of the car is up high, which limits your visibility.
However, the benefits far out-way the drawbacks.  The pick up, maneuverability and smooth ride are all top notch.  It looks a lot more expensive than it is, and I have gotten many compliments on it.
If you want to ride in sporty style on a budget, this is the car for it.
I have had my Avenger for almost a year now and still absolutely love it.<br><br>
