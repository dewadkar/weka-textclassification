            The 1993 Mazda MX-6 was the first car I've owned.  I bought it when I was 18, and I've currently owned it for about a year now.  

I bought the car for around $5,500 with 112,000 miles on it.  The car was fully loaded, with leather seating, premium sound system and alloy wheels.  The interior was in great condition, and it is to this day.  Although I'm not very high on the sound system, (I've heard more bass in Prince's voice) I still think it's decent. Other than that, the interior of the car is great.  

In terms of performance, I was very pleased with the car.  I once took my car out on I-88 from Chicago to Aurora one night.  With an open road way, and no cops in sight I was able to run my car up to 135 mph! And that was with a set of VERY thick floor mats.  I still believe if the mats weren't in the way, I could have ran the speedometer up to it's max. (Max, by the way, is 150 mph) I would also like to add that the steering column and interior stayed shake-free.  My point here is not to encourage insanely fast driving, it's just to show how the engine can still perform even after 120,000 miles.  

I get about 20-26 mpg, which I think is alright for a V-6. Then only major con with the MX-6 is with parts and repairs.   I once had to get my water pump changed.  The pump itself was $120, but with labor and changing of my timing belt, the total ran up to $700!  The timing belt, and water pump run on the same pulley and it's painstakingly long to change either one.  Other than the cost of repairs, (which, other than the water pump, haven't come by)the car is one that I give my full recommendation to.
