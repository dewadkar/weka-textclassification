            I bought it used.  Abused.  Beat down and lonely.  A car without a lover.  A tramp of a car, to tell the truth.  A car that had been that saddest of beings...a R E N T A L.
And I was in love.  I had something no one else did.  A real, living, breathing (dying choking) Camaro.  Convertible, no less.  Under warranty and ready to roll.
She died on me.  First, an engine rebuild.  Okay, not the worst, especially in a rental.  And I was wise enough to buy the extended warranty (100,000 miles, 5 extra years, worth every penny).  I could handle it.  I was in love...
Another engine rebuild. I didn't even have to take it in for an oil change.  It died within 3,000 miles.  I swore at the rep.  I cursed him.  I threatened him.  He fixed my car, and I revered him.  I offered to rake his leaves.  I wanted him happy.  He was a god to me.
And again, no time to change the oil.  No rebuild would satisfy me.  And, to their credit, GM installed a brand new motor, fresh out of the crate.  I made a few tiny file marks in the old case to see if they'd reuse it.  They didn't, godbless 'em.
This car has put me through endless pain, but it's worth it.  I&quot;m young, free, and cruising down the highway with the top down in a thing of beauty.

And when it get close to being out of warranty, I'll run it into a canyon, whistling a happy tune.  It's a good day to fight.  It's a good day to die.<br><br>
