            I wanted all the perks of owning an SUV (spacious interior, high clearance, tough terrain ready, ok for driving in weather conditions) without the gas guzzling, the inability to park, and the astronomical prices.  That is why I bought the Outback, and also why I'm keeping it.
  
I love the roomy interior and high ceilings. The amenities are practical for the most part, but my sunglasses don't fit in the above the head sunglasses holder.  The rack on top is perfect for tying down whatever I need to haul.  Plus it's really comfortable for people riding in the back.
Compared to an SUV it gets excellent gas mileage.  It drives well in the rain and snow.  The engine makes no sounds at all.

My Outback handles wonderfully.  The steering wheel is very sensitive.  The turns are really wide (not U Turn friendly), but again not really wide compared to those of a SUV.  The brakes are not the greatest, but they work.  The dealer will fix the brakes for free, however.

If you want the benefits of a SUV without the hassle of trying to park it or of filling up the gas tank every other day, then the Outback is for you.  For under $30,000.00, no other wagon even comes close.
If you just want a wagon to drive around town, you might like the regular Legacy wagon better.  It's less expensive and gets better gas mileage. <br><br>
