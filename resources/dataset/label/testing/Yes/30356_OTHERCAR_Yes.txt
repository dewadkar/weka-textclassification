            After owning an LS-400 sedan I was sold on the Lexus line of vehicles. I had owned a Mercedes vehicle previous to this and while I must admit that Mercedes is a class car I liked what I had seen and heard about this (at that time) relatively new line of cars.

In 1996 after two great years with my LS-400 I gave in to the temptation and purchased a brand new (1996)SC-400. For those who aren't aware, the Lexus is the high end of the Toyota Motor Company, the SC-400 would be considered the high end sports car to the Toyota Supra (which I also had the pleasure of owning).

First off, the SC-400 even though it is a sports car, is a luxury vehicle.
It is well constructed, very tight, and although the car is a bit heavy you feel safe (driver and passenger air-bags are standard) while driving it. Its a fast car to drive, great acceleration, the SC-400 is equipped with a V-8 engine which is remarkably good on gas. The seat adjustments are all power and afford driver and passenger with the utmost in comfort. All of the amenities one would expect in a vehicle of this type are there and well within reach of both driver and passenger (Climate Control,Seat Heaters, Stereo Controls, Visor Mirrors, Cruise Control, Etc...). Vision for the driver through both the front windshield, side and rear windows is very good and the side mirrors afford the driver ample viewing of approaching cars from the sides of the vehicle.

The Lexus people, unlike some other automobile makers, do not start with a low base price and then inundate you with options to get the cost up. 
There are very few options, most of the equipment is standard for the model, and although the car is pricey it is a quality piece of work. 

For a family with children, like most sports cars, the backseat (yes, there is a back seat) is not designed for comfort. There is ample space in the trunk for grocery shopping but not for anything more than that. The CD player is in the trunk, the controls for it are on the dash with the rest of the stereo controls, and although it has a capacity for 12 discs it is kind of a nuisance to have to open the trunk and wait for the disc holder to eject, remove a cd and replace it with a new one. The stereo system has a cassette player on the dash, AM-FM Stereo, and I would recommend that you purchase the optional Nakamichi Stereo Unit for the intense sound.

If I had not mentioned it before, this car is a beauty, it is a definite head turner. Mine is bright red with highly polished chrome wheels, another small option, and yes it's true what they say about little red sports cars-I have been pulled over at least three times. I remember what one fellow said to me one day about there always being at least one bad viewing angle for most cars but after walking around this one a couple of times he could not find one on this car. Very impressive.
