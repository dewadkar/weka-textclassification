            We bought a 1995 Buick LeSabre used from a dealership.  It was love at first sight for my husband, and so with a good trade-in it came home with us.  

The car rides like a dream.  We drove 1000 miles round-trip on a visit, and felt refreshed not tired when we stopped for fuel.  It's not an economy car but is reasonably fuel efficient on the highway.  It came with all the bells and whistles.  Gauges are easy to read.  Horn is easy to find in a hurry.  Hubby says he's never driving a clunker again!

It's a great car for those who like a bit of luxury, and probably would make a good family car.  I have no kids so can't be sure. It also may be a bit too big for a small person to handle well.    <br><br>
