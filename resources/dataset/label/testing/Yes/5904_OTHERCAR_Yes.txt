            I bought a 1998 Dodge Ram new.  It is the 1500 series model with the 8' bed with no extended cab, the small v-8.  I have brought this truck back in 5 times for the same problem that Dodge can't seem to find what is wrong with the transmission.  The truck is really great looking, great driving, and great handling.   The driver feels very safe as it sits up so high off the road and can see around almost anything except vans with out rear windows. The gas economy is very poor.  I do not carry any loads and still only get between 13 &amp; 15 miles per gallon on regular gas.  It does not handle very well on slippery road wether it be rain, sleet, or snow. The manufacturer says it has anti-lock brakes but the footnotes has only the front with ani-lock brakes.  The back wheels lock up and you slide any way.<br><br>
