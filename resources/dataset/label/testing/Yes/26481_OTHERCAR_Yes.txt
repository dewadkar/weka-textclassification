            When I first met my husband he had his Chevy S-10. To this day he still has it. It is a 1991 4x4 and we have never had any problems except for one time. But he  also babies it and takes really good care of it. It only has 51,000 miles on it and runs just as good as the day he bought it.

About 4 years ago we had a problem with it just dying on us. We took it to the shop, and found out they had a recall on a certain part so it was repaired at no cost to us at all. 

Other than this we have not had his truck to the shop except for scheduled maintenance checks. 

It is a 6 cylinder which of course will use more gas the a 4 cylinder but gets really good gas mileage. It is very durable and I find that it has more room the the new body S-10.

So we have no plans on getting rid of our S-10 in the near future.<br><br>
