            When my old 1989 Toyota Celica died a few months ago, I was in a bit of a dilemna. I had only $7500 with which to purchase a car, and I wanted to get something I would be happy with. I am 18 years old, and so I naturally wanted a fun car that was easy to maintain. The third dealer I went to had an mr2 there, and I fell in love. It was a 92 turbo, but I did not buy that one. When I took it to my mechanic, he said the turbo was due for an overhaul, and that it appeared as though the dealer had made some hasty repairs in order to sell this car. I scoured the internet until I found my current car - a 1991 normally aspirated MR2 with leather interior, cd, and a moonroof.I would have loved to have gotten the turbo, but the insurance companies add a lot of money for the turbo, and it is only 1.5 seconds faster to 60 miles per hour. Also, the turbos are more unreliable, and tend to need repair much more frequently than the normally aspirated engine.  This car has 64,000 miles on it, and I love it to death. Even though I am 5 feet 11 inches tall, 189 pounds and an avid weightlifter, I find the car to be perfectly roomy. The ergonomics and placement of the controls are just fine for me, and the shifter is a true joy to use. With that said, there are a few disclaimers before anyone should purchase this car: (1) Check it at a mechanic - don't assume that just because it is a toyota, it is perfect (2) If you have a family or make frequent trips with 2 or more people, don't even consider this car- I have to trade for my mom's Lexus LS400 or my Dad's Audi S4 on a regular basis if I need to go anywhere or go out with more than one friend. The car is awesome if you are a student like me, or as a secondary fun car, but it leaves  a lot to be desired as a primary car for more than one person. One last caveat - this car requires some getting used to. In a rear wheel drive car, it is relatively easy to induce a spin simply by letting off the gas in a turn, or turning to hard. While the oversteer is fun, I recommend that you take it to a track first and acquaint yourself with its handling at higher speeds.
