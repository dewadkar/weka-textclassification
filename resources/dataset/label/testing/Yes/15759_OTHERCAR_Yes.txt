            Our family of almost 4 moved up to upper New Hampshire last year.  At the time we drove something completely unworthy of the challenge a New Hampshire winter provides.  This past September, now a family of 4 plus two dogs, we headed out in search of a family vehicle that would *thrive* in our winter wonderland.

It didn't take me long to fall completely in LOVE with the Subaru Legacy Wagon.  The entire family fits comfortably, including the two dogs!  Our driveway is a challenge in the summertime, never mind in winter.  We live set back quite a ways from the road, and it's a straight up hill.  Last year I never left the house because I knew my car couldn't handle the incline.

Well we just had one of our biggest snow storms of this season and I had to be out driving right in the middle of it.  I picked up our oldest daughter at preschool and just kept saying WOW this is so amazing.  The handling, traction, and maneuverability will just blow you away!

I tell people constantly that I LOVE my car.  I am a fairly young woman to be driving a station wagon and honestly that was my only negative reaction to the car.  Didn't take long to get over that.  If you need a great family car that doesn't dredge up images of a land dwelling boat, a car that fits you, your kids and all the paraphernalia that goes along with them, a car that handles itself so well in bad weather...well I could go on, but you get the idea:

The Subura Legacy Wagon is for you!  I HIGHLY recommend this car.  I probably could keep talking about it forever.  Believe me this car delivers on it's promises of all wheel drive.  I've never felt safer.<br><br>
