            I bought this car from my grandfather in Illinois - where they salt the icy roads in winter.  That meant that when I drove it to Texas I had to immediately shell out $300 for a rusted out brake line.

I only drove it for a few miles per week, until i drove it to New Jersey.  It was big and roomy enough that I was able to pack all of my worldly possessions into the rear seats and trunk - freeing the passenger seat to act as a dining room.

It handled the streets of Hudson County and Manhattan quite well - sharp turns and all - in spite of it's large size.  But I didn't even THINK of trying to parallel park this monster!  The good thing is that it's so old, a scratch here or a ding there was nothing to worry about.

While on the East coast, where they salt the icy roads, a couple of the electronic door locks and windows stopped working.  When I got it back to Dallas I had to replace the rusted out muffler and I'm finding rust spots on the body.
