            Bought this card with about 35k miles on it... Knew the owner, and the car was kept in good condition...  oil and filter change every 3k... basic maintenance...

first thing (after a few weeks) that i did was upgrade the tires on the car... that made a HUGE difference... went with Dunlop D60 A2 JLB's... 205/60 15's...

the car handles much better now then on the OEM tires...

the car is well put together, and is very eye catchy... at first i wasn't thrilled about the appearance of the car, but it grows on you... trust me...  i've taken apart so much on this car, cuase i'm a car enthusiast (hence my screen name altimuh!)  i'm a member at www.altimas.net (site is a GREAT reference for nissan altimas - all years) and i've also done a bit of work to my altima 
www.geocities.com/altimuh/BlueBird/bluebird.html

the one bad thing i hate about this car is the turning radius... that's it... a few extra 3 pt turns, and other than that no problems...  it's well made, reliable... with good care, this car will last a long time... reliable references from www.altimas.net say they've gotten over 150k miles and are still going w/relatively no problems...

Things that will go wrong:
after 60k timing belt
sometime before 80k altenator...

other than that.. brake pads, tires, filters... pretty much standard... car isn't extremely difficult to work on either (i do all the work myself)...  if you are considering one of these cars, feel free to visit www.altimas.net for further opinions!!!!  it's a GREAT car.. i recommend this to all
