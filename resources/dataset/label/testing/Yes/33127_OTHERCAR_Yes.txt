            I bought this vehicle because my Pontiac Bonneville's air conditioner went out.  I looked at both new and used vehicles in the $12,000 to $18,000 range.  I wanted something mid-sized, v-6, with power windows and locks.  When Chevy offered the 1.9% interest rate over four years, I couldn't turn it down.  It came with all of the above features standard, and more, including CD player and tape deck, power everything, and Anti-lock brakes.

After having had the car for about 6 months, I continue to like the V-6 engine.  It's nice to have the power without having to spend so much money.  I also like that it doesn't feel small.  I hate how the Hondas  feel like they're about 2 inches off of the road.  I feel like I'm in a bigger car with the Malibu.  My daughter's car seat even fits nicely in the back seat.

The styling of this car leaves a little to be desired.  It's plain and simple, but if you're looking for pizzazz you're probably not considering this car anyway.  The interior fabric is also nothing to write home about, but the dirt isn't showing.  If I had it to do over again, I would spend the extra for the leather/sun roof package.  It would just make the car seem sharper.

Overall, if you're looking for a V-6 but can't afford a larger car, this is a great alternative.  I would look for the low interest rate offers, otherwise it might be beneficial to look into used cars.  It is a much better deal than a Mazda 626 or even a Honda, which charge so much extra for the V-6 and extras.
