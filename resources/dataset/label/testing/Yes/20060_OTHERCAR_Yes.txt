            My wife and I are not demanding camera users, but the wife aspires to become more adept.

We previously had an older Kodak DC280. The wife suddenly "saw the light" of digital once she discovered Shutterfly. The Kodak put out some prints with really odd colors, and the 2x zoom was basically useless. The battery life was terrible, and recharging four AA's was a pain.

I got the Pentax to replace it, and it has remedied all the complaints we had about the Kodak. I had been considering the Elph and I was worried that the Pentax might be too big. It's nearly too small!

The 5x zoom makes a world of difference, the colors are true and vibrant. The wife likes the ability to take black-n-white pics.

On the downside, I'm a complete amateur but I don't find the controls to be all that intuitive. I wouldn't call this a true point-and-shoot camera. There are a lot of features that are really cool but you have to read the manual carefully to learn how to use them. Carrying around the manual nearly doubles the size and weight of the package! I assume an experienced photographer would actually know what some of the symbols on the LCD actually mean. There are a lot of them! LOL

As another review mentioned, it is a little slow to start up. I find the optical viewfinder completely useless. It has very little to do with what shows up when you take the picture. I just look at the LCD.

I did figure out how to disable the digital zoom (I HATE digital zoom). The 5x is great, for once I actually had to zoom OUT!

The movie feature would be nifty if it supported 640x480. It's too low-res.

In summary I bought the camera primarily for the 5x zoom, the small size, the longer battery life and the image quality, as well as the availability of more advanced functions for the wife. We're very pleased. Once I figure out how to do the few things that I need to do, I'll be even happier.
