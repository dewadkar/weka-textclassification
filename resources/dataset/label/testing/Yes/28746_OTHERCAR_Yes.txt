            Note: This is an update to my original review of the current generation Jetta which was introduced in the U.S. for the 1999 model year and has remained relatively unchanged since. Please read my original review here:  <a href='/auto-review-5CDB-17026BD3-3845E89F-prod1'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-5CDB-17026BD3-3845E89F-prod1</a>

---UPDATE---

Just got back from a half-hour test drive of the 200-hp VR6 Jetta with a 5-sp tiptronic transmission and 17-inch wheels. What a blast! This engine finally has awaken and become an autobahn blaster, replacing the smooth but somewhat lacking 174-hp VR6 that preceeded it.

The 17-inch wheels, available as an option, contribute to a more solid ride. ESP (Electronic Stability Control) is now standard and, when switched on, keeps the front wheels from breaking loose during acceleration. With it switched off, the tires seemed to struggle for traction under my heavy foot!

A chrome dual-pipe exhaust compliments the new powerful additions.

On the downside, the rear seat is still unacceptably small. But I expect the redesigned Jetta, due in 2004, will attend to this. VW should take a look at the Nissan Altima which has been bumped into Honda Accord proportions for the Jetta's design trend. Maybe the Jetta doesn't need quite the wheelbase stretch that the Altima received, but at least it should offer the same rear passenger space as a BMW 3-Series which VW so much likes to associate the Jetta with. Since the Passat is already moving upmarket with its W8 engine, a bigger/roomier Jetta wouldn't cannibalize Passat sales. And I'd love to see a 4Motion Jetta in the U.S., too, which has been available in European markets for some time now.

As another reviewer noted, VW service is getting better every year, as dealership management and quality control is slowly overhauled. At this time, I still recommend checking out your VW dealer's reputation for service and problem resolution before buying from them. Some dealers are better than others, so driving an extra few miles out of your way may make all the difference.

Overall, the Jetta is still a great commuter car, but now with this added power, it matches the excitement I once had with my '92 Corrado VR6 automatic. I strongly recommend the 2002 Jetta GLX VR6 (200-hp) ... you cannot find a better combination of power, quality, and technology for the money in this market segment.
