            The Dodge Neon I bought new in 1995 is still running and still peppy as ever, a perfect ride for the city driver. But it is not quite the problem-free simplicity I had hoped for.

As a sophomore in high school, I got my first car. Pretty early for most people, but it was necessary to get me to and from school and also for long trips I would take regularly between houses.  So I went for practicality, not flashiness, and ended up with the four-door Neon. I got the Expresso edition to add a little extra pep to the engine, a rear spoiler, and a sports hood.

The car was great for me. It is a perfect car for the city. It's small, so it can squeeze into the tightest of parallel parking spaces.  And it's easy to handle so it can do those twists and turns in between parking cones that you always see on TV commercials.

Its got a roomy interior, comfortable seats, easy internal access to the trunk, a solid stereo system, and great visibility (which many small or sports cars often lack).  The powerful engine in the light, small body allows for great pickup and good speed on the highway.

The only down-sides to the Neon seem to show themselves only over time.  The first is poor gas mileage which doesn't prove to be up to the specs I expected. And the 10 gallon tank can't make it too far for long car trips.  The second issue I've found is that the car doesn't handle well in deep water.  I think that its steering system is computer operated because the steering column locks up in deep (6+ inches) water, preventing the driver from turning the wheel easily or completely. This could be dangerous in some situations. The last is more of an inconvenience, which is that the rooflights and stereo fuses seem to blow out easily, needing to be replaced too often.

But overall, the car is great for the city driver.  It won't do well for long drives or offroading, but the Neon is ideal for the city.<br><br>
