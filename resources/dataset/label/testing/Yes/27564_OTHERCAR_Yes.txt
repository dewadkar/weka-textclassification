            We bought our Grand Cherokee new in 1996 and have had very few problems with it. (One exception being the interior siding on the doors popping out, we think, due to the Arizona heat.) It is truly a fun vehicle to drive! You feel very sporty in it. We've taken it on many road trips and camping trips. We've even slept in the back, although it was a  bit tight for two people! One of my favorite features is the information panel above the rear-view mirror that tells you everything from the temperature outside to how many miles per gallon you are getting. The best part is that it tells how many miles until empty- a feature that has saved us many times! I would suggest this vehicle to just about anyone. <br><br>
