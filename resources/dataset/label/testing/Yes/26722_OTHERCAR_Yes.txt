            I was recently lamenting the cost of a decent entry level digital camera when I received the Olympus D360L as a gift.  My wife and I are expecting our first baby in the next few weeks, and I really wanted to be able to share pictures and updates with our families who are spread across the country.  I can tell you that I am overwhelmed with joy when speaking of my D360L.

Friends who have comparable digital cameras (1-1.5 megapixels, $250-$500) were likewise impressed with the quality and ease of use of the Olympus.  I frequently hear &quot;Hey, my Mavica doesn't do that&quot; or, &quot;those pictures are WAY better than mine!&quot;.  Heh.  It's all true - the Olympus flat out takes awesome pictures.  It has an excellent auto-exposure disposition that makes pictures come out great.  I think a lot can be attributed to the spot-metering light meter and the Olympus aspherical glass lens (not plastic like many competitors).  It's almost painfully easy to use, making it excellent for a digital beginner like me.  All features are very intuitive and are accessed via buttons on the top of the camera, and some guide buttons next to the LCD display (also extremely sharp).  The camera has a great heft and feel, unlike some of the more &quot;plasticky&quot; or cheap-feeling cameras.  This thing is solid and can (and should) go anywhere with you!

The editing software and accessories supplied with the camera are good too, although even a beginner will quickly desire to upgrade the batteries to NiMH rechargables to extend the rather pathetic battery life that alkalines give to digital cameras.  Also on my wish list are the AC adapter, a larger memory card (although you still can get 122 std. quality images on the stock 8MB Smart Card - good enough for the web), and the USB connector (serial port can be rather slow when transferring pics from camera to PC).

All in all, this is in my opinion the top choice for an entry-level digital camera that will give anyone room to grow and perfect their skill!<br><br>
