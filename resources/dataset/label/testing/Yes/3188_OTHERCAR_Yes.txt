            Crazy passion!That�s what I told my wife when I bought this car.
I bought it one month ago from a friend,the car has 20.000 miles and looks exactly like the one in the picture.Black with black leader,titanium inside,white watches,backet chairs,digital sound,etc...
First I have to inform that also I have a BMW M5 (new model),so this PORSCHE I bougt just for private pleasure,that means to use it only in weekends.
This is a car for to enjoy it private,driving trough small roads,with curves ,where you can enjoy the aceleration,the safe feeling with the 4 wheel drive ,and the way you can get inside of the curves.It�s like special big go kart,that when you drive all the road sensations you feel then in your hands.
The sound from the engine it�s great,just pure music,the equipment it�s great ,and really you are wishing to have the free time to enjoy this toy.
I think this is really the last autenthic Porsche Carrera 911,the new one has a different engine,desing,and inside looks like a Boxster,it�s more confortable,different sound, so it�s not a pure one like the 996.
If you are thinking to buy one 996 Turbo,I highly recomend it ,because the power 408 cv it�s like the M 5, but different.
Like all these tipe of cars do not take when there is raining  because the big tires (285 rear)can give you a surprise.
The maintance should be made on the Porsche agents.
I will not say how much I paid but was a good price and 
I think these cars they always keep a high value.
