            Our Impreza (a non-Outback wagon, automatic transmission, 2.2 litre engine) is my girlfriend's car, and I'm worried about this pairing.  Not only does her affection for the little Subie sometimes rival her affection for yours truly, but Melissa also vows to NEVER get rid of the car.  Ever.  And she's serious.  And she's 23, so I worry that she will spend the next 50 years fussing over that little white snowball of a car just to make sure it keeps taking her where she needs to be.  And with the Subaru, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it lasts that long.

I have seen innumerable articles by many automotive journalists which espouse the theory that it's a lot more fun to drive a slow car fast than it is to drive a fast car slow.  The Impreza is a perfect example of why this can be true.  My girlfriend likes her Subie because it can take her and most of her stuff wherever she wants to go.  She likes it because it has NEVER in 40,000 miles not started.  For that matter, no component of the Impreza has stopped working perfectly in the years we've had the car.  She likes it because it's simple and inexpensive to maintain.  She likes it because she feels safe, what with that solid thunk of the doors and the communicative way in which the car handles--the steering, brakes, cornering, and acceleration are always in tune with the driver, and that makes her feel in control.  She likes it because it can go through feet of snow and never slip.  We even tried to get it stuck once in a blizzard, and the Subie disappointed.  It's difficult to even get the car to slide out of its path in show.  Impressive, indeed!

I, on the other hand, love driving the Subie for several different reasons.  Sure, I like the wagon's versatility (though the hatch space should be bigger) and I like that the car is so reliable, but what really makes the little Sube shine it is build quality and handling.  This thing is solid!  I'm the first to admit that the Subaru isn't as quiet or as refined-seeming as a Honda or a Toyota, but it feels world's more well screwed together.  Plus, despite not being a speed-demon of a car, the Subie is great fun to drive.  Perfectly balanced in terms of weight distribution, the car corners flat at most speeds, and it honestly takes to the twisties better than all other cars I've driven, including some very expensive German autos supposedly designed for that very purpose.  

The seats are comfy, controls are well thought out and placed, and the car, even in our 'base' L form, comes well equipped with power windows and central locks, a good stereo, and A/C.  

Do we have complaints?  Sure.  We rarely get better than 26 MPG highway or 22 MPG in town, in part because of the AWD and the related issue of the small car's heavy weight.  None of our adult friends or relatives can be in the back seat for more than half an hour.  And, even though the car is a wagon, it's short enough that big stuff still doesn't fit well, if at all.  Plus, at 75 MPH on a trip, the car is decidedly noisy.  You have your choice of sounds from the cacophony:  engine, tires, roof rack, wind--they all contribute to the loudness.  We have to really crank the radio to drown it all out.

Despite those complaints, I feel that for just under 20 grand, you really can't find a better balanced car.  Not only does Subaru give you a great-handling all weather car for the same price as a hum-drum (and smaller) Civic, but the Impreza feels like it was constructed by Mercedes by accident.  I'm sure that my girlfriend will enjoy 50 more years with her beloved and trustworthy little Subie wonder.
