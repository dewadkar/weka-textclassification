I fell in love with this car when I saw all the great features that had with such a low price. Mazda not only built a solid good looking car they help you get them with the special financing and cash back to use for the down. 
The car came with power everything. The engine is a V6 with five speed manual transition. A person could easily think they were in a sports car due to all the power and the great handling of this family sedan. 
If you look in the interior you will find a full set of gauges and a lot of attention to detail on the lay out of everything. I especially liked the rotating vents in the dash. The vents blow and move side to side to keep air moving around. COOL! The seats are very nice and I can easily sit three hours in them without getting a soar bottom. 
The outside of the car looks modern and can compete with any accord or Camry. If you put them up dollar for dollar then you will get a lot more bang for the buck with the Mazda. This car has a better warranty than most and the roadside assistance that comes with the car is for real. My wife had a flat and she called the 800 number- they came without any delay to her work,fixed the flat and Mazda covered the cost. That is just a small part of what Mazda is all about. 
I would recommend this car to any person who wants a nice car that won't break your bank.
