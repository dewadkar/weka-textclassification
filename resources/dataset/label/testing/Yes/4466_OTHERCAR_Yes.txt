            GM made the 95 with a corvette engine in it and boy can the car white smoke the tires!  You barely touch the gas and you fly.

What I really like about the car is how roomy it is and the stereo system is pretty cool for a luxury car.  Sounds great with the Classical music on.  I love the heater in the seats.  It has a huge trunk.  ALOT of room in the back seat.  Automatic everything.  

The things I hate are how big the car is and when you take curves that it feels like you are going to flip over and the tires squeal.  That's at 40mph on a 55mph curve.  Definitely not a car for sharp corners.  Another bad thing is when you are on the highway and going between 55-70, depending on the speed limit, the car starts to get bouncy.  It's a small bounce but it's constant.  This is on flat roads and roads with little bumps.  

Overall, I think the car is great for a family car.  It looks like it was manufactured to take a beating a keep on going.  <br><br>
