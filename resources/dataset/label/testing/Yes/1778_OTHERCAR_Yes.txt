            I'm the original owner of a Candy Apple Red '97 Sebring JXi, and I still love it after 5 years.  

Mechanically, the car has been Ok.  During the warranty period I the alternator replaced, and a transmission part replaced.  Not great, but my local Chrysler dealer repair shop is open till midnight so it was easy to get these problems repaired the same day they happened.  Also, the rear view mirror shakes a bit on most any road surface, and quite a bit on gravel/cobblestone.  Starting to get some rattles in both doors which I need to look at...

Other than that, the paint is still holding up well (I polish and wax 2 times a year).  The beige leather seats have not cracked (I also condition them 2 times a year - only takes 20 minutes).  The beige top has the normal light stains and minor wear, but nothing to complain about -- I knew it wasn't going to last forever.  Motors for the top and windows are still working fine.  A/C is still working fine and has never needed any coolant added.  Looks like I'm going to get about 50K miles on the factory tires -- since I've heard they cost over $200 ea to replace, at least they lasted longer than normal.  On board computer (outside temp, course, current/average mph, remaining miles) works fine.  Net, regarding reliability nothing to really complain about.

Regarding practicality...  I couldn't live without some kind of trunk space, and in this price range the Sebring has the largest trunk I know of.  Also, although not huge, the back seat easily seats 2 adults.

Other comments...  With the top down, the ride is very different in the front vs rear seats when going over 45mph.  In the back, you really get much more wind than in front.  No problem with dash shakes like other convertibles.
