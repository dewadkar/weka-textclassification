            My wife and I recently had the pleasure of driving a Subaru Outback AWD Wagon in Colorado when the rental car we originally started with, a Nissan Altima, failed to operate.  Having to wait too long for a replacement, Budget was kind enough not only to give us credit for the day, but to provide us with a semi-loaded, all-wheel-drive vehicle, especially when considering we were headed to the mountains in a couple days.

As a passenger I thoroughly enjoyed the Outback.  Roomy, quiet, comfortable; a very nice ride.  As a driver, my initial experience left me with some concern in regard to the position of my legs, but as soon as I figured out how to tilt the steering wheel and got the seat situated for my style of driving, things felt real nice.  I like being able to lean back in the seat, and I would have to say that this is probably the only vehicle I've ever driven--or ridden in--where the headrest was ergonomically correct.  My wife had no complaints.

Heading out of Denver, we drove westward into the Rockies via I-70 to elevations exceeding 8,000 feet.  The Outback had no problem climbing, and acceleration was impressive, even uphill.  When punching it, the engine immediately sounded like that of a sports car until we reached cruising speed at which point it became very quiet again.  In fact, the car is so quiet that in neutral, it can be difficult to tell if the engine is even running.  Around corners, on turns, and changing lanes quickly, the Outback handles great and feels well-balanced.

In the rear seat, there is substantial leg room for an adult passenger on either side with plenty of room for a child in the middle.  (I wouldn't recommend three adults in the back as the person in the middle would have a conflict of interest with the other two where legs were concerned.)  In the cargo area, there is plenty of space to accommodate a full complement of luggage for all occupants.

Gauges, buttons and controls are presented in such a manner that it seemed obvious to me that the folks at Subaru had given a lot of thought as to what made sense with regard to appearance and positioning.  Judge for yourself, but to me it's a logical setup and one that I was very pleased with.

In short, my wife and I were so impressed with the handling and performance of the Subaru Outback, in what turned out to be something of an extensive test drive, that we are looking into buying one.

I had already been thinking Subaru after learning that the Legacy ranked #1 in an official 40 mph front end collision test.  I think the larger Outback would suit us better, however.  Add a CD player, an Igloo cooler/warmer setup, and a bike rack on top, and I think we'd pretty much be set.  Oh yeah, and the sunroof/moonroof option.  

Take one out for a weekend and let me know what you think.
