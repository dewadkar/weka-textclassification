            For one year, we as a family of three did a lot of searching and researching sports utility vehicles. We had decided to purchase a &quot;truck&quot;. We visited the local auto malls, car dealers and internet. We took many trucks for the so called &quot;road test&quot;. We kept coming back to the Ford Explorer XLT. Please understand that we have always been a Chevy family, we felt like traitors or visitors from space, after all we are looking at a Ford. Well, in November we stopped searching, we purchased our Ford Explorer 2000 and we are a very happy family. The ride is very smooth, at times you forget that you are driving an sport utility vehicle. There's plenty of room for luggage, groceries, skis, tools and our most precious pet, Missy. It is a good looking &quot;truck&quot;, yet tough. Has the power needed for towing a boat and is delicate enough to attend a very important affair.
The one draw back the Explorer has is the noise, it is not built to exclude the outside noise.
If you have a very active family, who enjoys sports, the outdoors, driving
or just loves to have a reliable good looking vehicle, then this is the Sports Utility for you. We recommend it...<br><br>
