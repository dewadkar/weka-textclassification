            I am 20 years old and this is my first car. I bought it used about 3 months ago and didn't really know what to expect from the car, I had never driven a Volkswagon before. Now I don't think I will ever want to own anything beside a Golf. The car is solid, comfortable, and very roomy for what I thought was a small car. It rides like a Lincon and handles like a Mustang. I could drive around in it for hours just for something to do, it is so fun to drive. This car is considered a compact car, but i would classify it as a sub-compact. It has more rear leg room than my parents Nissan Altima, granted it is a hatch-back and doesn't have a massive trunk or anything, but it will hold two large suitcases and some extras. With the back seat folded down you can sleep two people on it (no joke). In my opinion this car is suitable for just about anyone. Test drive one and see. You won't be disappointed.  Thanks. <br><br>
