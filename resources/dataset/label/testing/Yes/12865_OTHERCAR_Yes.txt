            I am 19. My first car was a 94 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. I bought it when I was 16. It turned out to be a royal lemon. My local Infiniti dealer gladly accepted it as a trade in towards a J30, even though the timing belt snapped and the starter died and the same time. The dealership, South Motors Infiniti in Miami, treated my very well. My mother has 2000 Lexus, and our dealership experience with Infiniti surpasses Lexus by far. 

The automobile is a genuine piece of class, not glass, CLASS. This is a class act on the road that turns heads frequently. Adored by my friends, I really rather drive my 96 J30 than my mother's 2000 Lexus RX300. Although the Lexus gets more looks from the Ladies...hehe.

The J30's engine is great. The hum it provides really ignites me. It is a nice sound that is not too loud or too soft. The car's interior is beautiful, and although most have commented the lack of space in the car, I must object to that. I am 6'5&quot;, and I fit comfortable...you just have to find the perfect driving position. The seating position is quite low, so getting in and out of the car is not as easy as doing the same in the Lexus SUV, duh. I love mostly everything about this car, but of course there are some exceptions. The traction is awful. It amazes me how Infiniti didn't throw in Traction Control for this high powered rear wheel drive vehicle. The problem can be corrected though with the correct tires. The Goodyears that came with the vehicle were very poor in traction. Just the slightest wetness on the road would cause the rear to spin in moderate acceleration. I replaced all of the tires with some great Firestone tires, and although I am not sure of the model of tires, if it really interests you, you can email me at ninodesign@aol.com and I will provide this information for you. These tires are great, and really help the J's traction problem.

Infinitis somehow lose tremendous value when compared to lexus, Acura, Bmw, etc. I find it difficult to believe, since Infiniti, with the exception of the G20, makes some excellent automobiles. I drive the J quite hard, safely but hard, and the reliability has been excellent. In fact, I tried 87 octane once, and have filled up on it ever since. The car runs fine without any complaints. Great used car value here. Why get a used ES300 when the J30 not only costs less, but is clearly the better car. My mother owned a 94 ES300 prior to the RX300 and the J clearly outperforms it in many aspects.<br><br>
