            We bought a 98 dodge ram van (converson)For my husband to have converted for a wheelchair van.On the out side it is attractive.Ours is black.We had it for a month and that is where the trouble begins.In the corse of a weekend Both windows in the front broke.So we had one that would not go up and one that would not go down.Now I know what you are thinking that is not a big deal right.It is all covered by the warrenty,yes it is.But it took this major car company almost 2 months to send the replacement parts.So we were with out a car for 2 months.Because the dealer in our area did not alow you to keep a borrowed car for more that a weekend.
So then about a month later our check engine light came on,by this time we had relocated to a lager area so we were hoping to get better service from dodge.Nope it got worse,the reason the light comes on is a bad computer chip.Well on new years eve day of 99 we took it in,they told us they would order the part. We Are STILL WAITING.It has been a year. And I call at least once a week and get the same line we are waiting for it.well we own the van we payed 32000 for it and that was before the wheelchair conversion.It runs ok it is very loud and you hear alot of street noise in it.Like the tires rubbing.It only has 2200 miles on it.And we also lost our air  and heat.The only thing that works is the defrost.And the inside is falling apart too.Our rearview mirror just fell off one night and shattered.and the arm on the passenger seat fell of this weekend.I realize this is minor stuff but in the end it adds up to a big annoyance.We will never buy another dodge.From the start it was a hassle from the poor treatment at the dealership to the constant breakage in the van.I dont recommend this vehicle to anyone.Nor do i think anyone should deal with a dodge dealership.<br><br>
