            I bought my '99 Jeep Wrangler about 6 months ago and I love it.  It's 4 cylinder, 4WD, manual, and great for off-roading.  That said, here are a few big cons that some people might take issue with, though I don't.

It's a gas hog.  Ok, I used to drive a Honda Accord that got 40 highway miles per gallon.  I knew I wouldn't get close to that with a Jeep, but I sure didn't expect to be getting as low as 20mpg.  

It hates the interstate.  This Jeep will not go past 80 mph, ever.  When climbing steep grades, that number can go down as low as 30mph.  If you have a manual transmission, you can downshift to get a little more power, but not much.

There's hardly any storage space.  The back seat folds up, yes, but this only frees up about 8 more sq. ft. According to the manual, the seat is capable of being completely taken out, but I have tried and have been unable to do it.  If anyone knows how, email me at gbudhram@kc.rr.com.

This said, I still love my Jeep.  There's nothing like cruising with the top off on a cool night.
