            I bought my '93 vtec honda prelude used with 60,000 miles on the odometer.  The majority of the time this car has been a pleasure to drive.  It has 190HP that fills more like 250HP due to its vtec technology and smooth 5spd manual transmission.  As a daily driver its extremely comfortable in the front seats (the back seats look good but are rather worthless) If you feel the need for speed it also satifys quite well.  it handles like a dream and you can corner like your in an F-1 racecar.  Braking distance is also very good, along with driver and passenger side airbags, giving the car a sense of safety.  At first the dash layout was a bit strange, but it makes all the gauges extremely visible.  It did'nt take me long to start to prefer most of the dash layout.  Everything interior wise is very stylish except for the center consol, which has no storage or cupholders.  Making this car more sport than luxury, which is fine by me.  The only downfalls I find in the vehicle are the 15" wheels with 205/55/15 tires.  These are very capable but i feel the prelude should have been sold with 16" wheels and a wider tire.  Most people prefer front wheel drive which the prelude is, i would prefer the car to be rear wheel.  All and all im very pleased with the performance and reliability ive recieved for the price i paid.  not to mention, the exterior design is very attractive and I swear its still a total babe magnet even though its an almost 10 year old design.
