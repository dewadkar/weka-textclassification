            I purchased my 2000 Sahara in August of that year. The first thing I noticed was that gas consumption was down, way down. I drive about 400-500 miles a week and I would find myself refilling every 4-5 days. But lets face it, I did not buy the wrangler because it was fuel-efficient. I purchased it because it was a rugged vehicle, which could handle itself in all aspects of my active life. Why I like it: First of all: It looks awesome, with or without the hard top, 2. It handles great (these vehicles were not designed to do 40 mph turns though) in or out of the city, 3. Plenty of power if you purchase the 4.0 in-line six cylinder, The engines were made to last, it's super strong. . 4. It looks awesome. 5. It is the vehicle I have always envied people driving, 6. It's a symbol of freedom and youth for me, I am 22 and I cannot think of another car I would rather have even if I were to pay twice the money for a more expensive vehicle (well maybe a Porsche Boxter...). 7. Turning radius. 
If you live in a climate, which is not warm all year round, go with the hard top. 
Okay, so what are the downfalls to owning such a vehicle? 1. As I have already mentioned, fuel efficiency 2. Noise (even with the hard top, you still have considerable noise when driving over 60 mph) 3. Somewhat bumpy ride (this is a jeep, not a Cadillac). 4. Cargo room (small rear seat with virtually no trunk. Aside from these downfalls, I would say this machine is a winner that can take on anything... it's a jeep! As to the reliability, I cannot yet comment on that because it is still pretty new, however: after doing extensive research, I have discovered that the previous model year vehicles have held up pretty well.
