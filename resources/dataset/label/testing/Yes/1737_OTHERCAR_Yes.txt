            Driving in the Mercedes S-500 is one of the greatest experiences I can think of.  Luxury is not the word for a car like this.  With beautiful suspension, it feels like you're driving on flat pavement when you are on an old dirt road.  With gadgets that you will keep discovering a year after you first got it, the Mercedes is truly the greatest car ever made.  A step above the rest, the S-500 can out accelerate most, with a beautifully powerful engine that you can feel every time you step on the accelerator.  If you have never been in one of these cars you haven't really ever felt what it is like to drive.  This car is the greatest ever built, making me wonder how they can improve them in the future.  Bottom line:Greatest Car Ever Made<br><br>
