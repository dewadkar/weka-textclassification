            We looked and looked for a van that would fit our family and business.  The Dodge Grand Caravan seemed to be the perfect choice.

At the time I had a children's daycare operation in my home.  Several children needed to be taken to school along with my own children and since the van seats 7 we had NO problem with seating.

We first had problems with the van on our way home from the dealership.  It had a vacuum leak and some other problem.  Anyway NO biggie, it was still under warranty.  

We bought the van used.  The dealership told us it was from a group of rental vans that had been bought.

We have had the van since 1992 and I would say it has cost us almost as much as we paid for it.

We have had to put two new transmissions in it, two new starters, a new alternator, new steering column, 2 new computers etc etc.  I can't believe the problems with this van.

I love driving the van.  I'm a short person (as my husband puts it, I'm vertically challenged), and I really like the fact that I'm higher up and can see extremely well.

I love taking this van on trips, providing it doesn't break down.  It is VERY comfortable and since it is a Grand Caravan, it has more leg room in the middle seat section and even a little bit of leg room with the third seat. 

This would be a great family vehicle.  I have had a less than favorable experience with the Dodge Grand Caravan but would recommend other people at least try it out on their own.<br><br>
