            I feel for the money, the car is well worth it. I have 14,000 miles on my Leganza CDX and so far I have had not ONE problem the car is just excellent. I feel the Daewoo might just be THE best NEW car out on the market. The car is extremely sturdy well put together and the fit and finish is equal to or better than Camry or Accord. When this car receives a V6 it truly will be equal too or better than any Honda or Toyota. I strongly suggest a look at the Leganza. When the numbers become available alot of people will realize that this new comer happens to be one of the best built cars in the United States. I cant get over the styling the Leather and the A1 stereo system I am so glad I didnt pick an Accord or Camry!! I think Daewoo is a real winner and I feel they will be around for a long time. When I drive this car I fell so good to be driving such a nice car it is so quiet and sturdy. I think this car would be best suited for an older couple that needs reliability or a family who would like reliability, safety and value. I am only 19 and I feel as if I am driving a family car but I still do love it so much and so do all of my friends my dad also likes it!! Well, I just hope people really give Daewoo a look over and see what an excellent car it is. :-)<br><br>
