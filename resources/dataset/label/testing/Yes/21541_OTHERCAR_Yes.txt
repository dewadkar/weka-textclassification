            Canon has always been known for their amazing lenses and 35mm cameras.  With the digital age well into full effect, Canon has managed to bring their traditional camera knowledge into the digital market.  

Prior to owning my Canon Elph S200, I had a Fujifilm point and shoot 2mp digital camera.  It ran on 4 AA batteries and used SmartMedia memory.  The pictures came out great, but the camera was bulky, the battery life was weak and at the time, SmartMedia was difficult to find at a relatively cheap price.  

I managed to get a good buy on my S200 and have been using it for about 1.5 years now.  I added a 256mb CompactFlash card for $40 (EBay).  I have used the camera in many functions including parties, snowboarding/skiing trips, sporting events and just everyday use of taking random candid photographs.  Though the camera is only 2mp, the picture quality is very clear and crisp.  I print out plenty of photos and even at a 5x7 print the pictures turn out well without any grainy areas.  I haven't tried to print an 8x10 enlargement, but I can't imagine that the naked eye could tell a difference between a 2mp and 3mp photograph.

The camera's menu functions are very easy to learn.  Though there are a handful of features I never use, I have enjoyed the Macro, Daylight and Nighttime settings.  I have also begun using the Black and White feature more and more.  You can delete and view pictures directly on the camera's LCD and even with the mini movies you can record (With SOUND!) you can view that on the camera as well.  Obviously you can transfer your photos from the camera to your computer via a USB cable (that unfortunately is a special cable made by Canon).  The newer models, I understand, use a standard USB A to B cable instead of the proprietary cable that my camera uses.  Transfer speeds are okay via the USB cable, but i sometimes with it were faster when I am transferring hundreds of photographs.  

There are 3 different quality settings and each of those has 3 settings of their own.  So, there are actually a combination of 9 quality settings to set the resolution and compression of your photos.  

With a full charge of the lithium ion battery, I can probably take a couple hundred pictures before I have to go recharge.  Best of all, a full recharge takes only about an hour, so you can take a break for lunch and voila, by the time you finish eating you'll be ready to take some more photos.  

The software that came bundled with my camera was Canon's own software.  This is the one piece of the package that I am not really fond of.  The transferring and navigation amongst the various programs is redundant and just wastes my time.  It's not the easiest task to just download the photos.  First it goes to an album, and then from there, you can save it to your desktop.  

All in all, great package for the price I paid.
