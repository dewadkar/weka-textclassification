            I just want to say that I've had my 1992 4x4 XLT fullsize Bronco for 4 years now and I love it.  I couldn't ask for anything more in a vehicle.  The first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing.  It looks mean!  The interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach.  Currently it has 135,000 miles on it with not a lick of trouble.  Everything on the Bronco is stock besides the 33&quot; tires and a Dynomax turbo muffler.  The ride is decent for a truck-like SUV, but the stiff suspension can really help out when off-roading.  The 5.0L powerplant is surprisingly powerful.  I can beat my friend's stock Chevy Z71 0-60 even with my 33&quot; tires (although he hates when I bring it up).  I don't see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle.  Me and about 8 of my other friends have gone over 120,000 miles on our Broncos (135,000 for me) without incident.  I just think that some people don't know what the term &quot;routine maintenance&quot; means.  <br><br>
