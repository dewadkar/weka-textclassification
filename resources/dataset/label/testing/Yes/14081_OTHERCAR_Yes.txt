            I have owned a 3, a5,and now a proud owner of a 740il. I'm one of those people who buy cars 2 yrs old. This way you get what you want without the big depreciation curve.
 Well if you want luxury the 740 is the car. The ride is smooth like butter. It has a voice activated telephone,and the persons voice is heard through the cars 10 speaker system.You hear everything. You might find yourself looking for excuses to drive somewhere just to enjoy the excitement of driving.If you carry passengers they will love the back seats.They have a feel of a limo.Enough leg room for the tallest person.
 Everything important is at fingers touch in the steering wheel.
But this car is big.I still own a 5 and enjoy the feel of the road better when driving this car.They are 2 different worlds. The 7 for Sundays and when you have company to drive and want the utmost in luxury. The 5 when you're by yourself and feeling sporty.
If your worried about gas prices this car is not for you as the 8 cylinders will eat the fuel. 
 I just wish that everyone could experience the thrill of driving this car at least once.( Someday I'll grow up)<br><br>
