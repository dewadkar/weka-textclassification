              The 2002 Dodge Neon is arguably a better buy used than 
new, as it has terrible resale value, partly due to the 
large number in rental fleets.  I needed a cheapie car at 
my part-time Hawaii residence, and liked the price on this 
one year old Neon--$8,600 in Hawaii, where cars are usually
more expensive than on the Mainland.  New last year, my
car would have sported an MSRP before rebates of about 
$15,500.  I say, if one buys used, buy a car with lousy 
resale value and save money!
   I'm actually thrilled with the car.  I like the style, 
but that's subjective.  The front seats are remarkably 
comfortable for my 6' frame, and the back seats have good
legroom for an economy car.  I drove '02 Foci (plural of
Focus) before buying the Neon, and the Neon was much 
quieter running.  (But, the 03 Focus has marked improvements
in noise supression, so, if you're buying new, be sure to 
compare).  
   The  interior of the Neon looks much less cheap than that
of the Civic, though not as upscale-Euro as the Focus 
interior.  My car presumably took a beating as a rental car
before I bought it, and the seat fabric still looks great.
   There's a big trunk, and if you fold down the rear seat,
you can accomodate all but the longest surfboards  inside the car.  Storage is great for a car this size.
   Quality seems good, with close panel fits and great paint
--a hand wax job really made the paint shimmer.
   OH, and yes, it's economical.  We don't have real freeway
type driving on Maui, but in what passes here for highway
cruising I have achieved 25MPG.
   All in all, a great car for the money--shop hard and you
should be able to find a '02 now for about $9,000, still 
under mfr warranty.  That is a DEAL!
