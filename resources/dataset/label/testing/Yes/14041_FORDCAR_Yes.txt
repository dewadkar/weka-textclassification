            This has to be one of the best small trucks of all time. This was the very first vehicle I bought on my own, so maybe I am prejudice. But I absolutely loved it. It was just the right size for me. 
When I went car shopping, I knew I wanted a truck. But I wasn't sure what kind. I tried all of them out and this was the only one short enough for my legs. (I'm 5'3&quot;)  It was strong and sturdy enough to tow and do what I needed it to. It was also a true joy to drive.
My truck was a standard and a pretty basic package. It did have cruise and a nice radio, but nothing fancy. 
I had a wreck in it once. The airbag did some damage, but that was about he extent of it. If I had been in a car or another truck, the police officers and paramedics said it would have been much worse.
When I took the truck to the shop to be repaired, I knew it would never be the same. But much to my surprise, it was good as new. Now that could have been the body shop. But I prefer to think it was the truck itself!
The only drawbacks to this truck are the cab size and the gas mileage. I had one child when I bought this truck, and that's about all that will fit....one child and one adult. Also the gas mileage was about 18 to the gallon. But other than that I just loved it. Great buy!<br><br>
