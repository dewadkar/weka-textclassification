            I did not start driving until I was 26 years old and this was the car we had then. I can not say enough wonderful things about it. It was easy for me to learn to drive on, and handled very well. This is a great little economical car. We hardly ever had  major maintenance on it other than normal wear and tear. Unfortunately in our move to Florida we had to sell it, as at the time they had an impact fee on vehicles brought from out of state and I didn't have that kind of money. I am looking for another one like this. We just haven't been able to find the right one.  But I know someday that I will and I am trying to be patient until then.
If you are in the market for a used vehicle look at the Chrysler LeBaron as in my opinion it is a great little car and economical on gas as well.
Here is an example of the economical side of this car.The round trip cost of gas to and from Florida, was, are you ready, 100.00. This was with 7 of us in the car and full of luggage.<br><br>
