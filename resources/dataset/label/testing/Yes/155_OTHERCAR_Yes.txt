            The Fuji MX-1200 had the best price/ performance I could find.  Megapixel quality for $250 (I also got a free USB card reader from Fuji so it was even cheaper)  The serial cable is equal to a 2400 baud modem now, super slow.  The new cameras have the USB port built in, i think the 1300 is the new version of this camera.  
Great pictures at high resolution, i average 330K files &amp; have to zoom in to see the choppy pixelation squares that i see on other cameras.  
The only minus is no lens cover/ cap.  No scratches on mine yet but all my other cameras have had one &amp; it makes me a little nervous.  I have big hands &amp; the size is perfect with really easy controls &amp; nice icons.  All cameras eat batteries but if you use the AC cable (cheap new ones on ebay) then it can reshoot really fast.  I end up using it once a week at least for everything, ebay, auto accident, getting graphics to the computer, repair work... It works great for macro close up work too. So far about a thousand pictures and never a problem.  <br><br>
