            ***update is at the bottom ***

This is my first digital camera, but I have used many others from my I.T. pals.  After owning this camera for over 2 months I have taken many pictures over the holidays and I can say that the picture quality at 2 mega-pixel is very detailed.  However, my friends Coolpix 990 and high-end Casio 3000 (both at 3 mega-pixel) were noticeably sharper (which is almost not fair to compare to the Elf�s 2 mega-pixel resolution, but the fact remains). 

 It is well constructed because it is made of all metal, not plastic and clumsy like the Coolpix 990 or bulky like the Casio 3000.

It�s tiny, so even with those other cameras around it�s always the life of the party. You can really carry it around in your pants pocket! It�s that small!  It is also extremely stealthy for those undercover shots.

Price was high (but now I think it fell $200 from my purchase price of $599). Expect to buy an additional flash card 32mb $79 (8mb is just not enough; trust me you will be taking pictures like mad!). I have a 32mb card and can take about 60 pics at medium resolution.  The standard 8mb card will only hold 16 pics at medium resolution.  Medium resolution is so close the max resolution and half the file size that it makes sense to use this setting.

Don�t worry about the battery, yes it�s proprietary but the battery can hold the charge for well over 45 pics with flash on, or shut down the video display and use the built-in view finder which saves battery power.   If your taking more than 45 pictures at one time you will probably become annoying to the people around you, or you�re a professional photographer (in which case this camera is not for you).

In short, if you�re like me and like quality hi-tech toys, this is for you.
If you are looking for the absolute sharpest quality pictures look for the Coolpix 990 or Casio 3000 (lists between $800 - $1000).

I've had the Cannon Elf S-100 for well over 8 months now. The best part of it is being able to keep it in my pants pocket during wedding, birthdays, bar-b-ques, etc. I get about 40 - 50 pictures on a single charge at medium resolution. I think the next step is to buy a 64mb Compact flash card, and another Cannon battery ($45 aprox). This way I can hold over 80 pictures and because the extra battery is tiny, the unit is still stealthy. 

PS This is the best spy camera, I can take a picture of anything and you wouldn�t even know I had a camera on me!!!! lol
