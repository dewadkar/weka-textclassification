            What a bizarre car company!  I have been familiar with Subaru for as long as I was able to drive, and as an automotive professional, I can safely say that here is a company that has gone out of its way to be different. Perhaps Outback of the barn.

The 1998 Subaru Legacy Wagon proves again that change is not always the answer to making cars better.  For years the Legacy has been refined, with many of the features incorporated in its debut in 1990 still in use, but refined. 

This car is functional, stylish, reliable, economical, easy to drive, and simple to fix.  The drive train is about as bulletproof as they come, if you do the maintenance as recommended.  Stability is good, and the road manners are impressive.  Subaru uses an inline as opposed to transverse mounting of the engine, which allows this car to accelerate without a hint of torque steer.  The simple AWD system is so reliable that many Subarus will never need repairs in this area.  The suspension is gentle and although is never going to be confused with a sports car  is still agile and fun to drive.  

Transmissions, now that is a matter of preference to some but for my money, I will take the 5 speed.  Clean and precise shifts were not always trade marks of the Subaru manual transmission, but, as I stated previously, they have refined their product.  In the event of a clutch failure the replacement is quite simple and relatively inexpensive.

Instrumentation is laid out to be user friendly and functional, there is nothing worse than getting behind the wheel of a car that requires you keeping the owner's manual open to the index page.  The seats are somewhat softer than I like, but if you have ever driven a 1973 Subaru DL you know how much closer to Rolls Royce the 98 Outback is.  Visibility from the inside looking out is a good feature for this car.  I find that some of the simple passive features allow drivers to be safer and good visibility is very important for safety.

If I could I would change a few things but the major change I would make would be in the structural integrity of this car.  Unfortunately, the crash data for rollover fatalities of drivers in this car are ranked #1, which is not where you want to be on that list.  But as I have seen through the years Subaru will refine and no doubt this issue will be resolved.  

This is still, in my opinion, an excellent automobile for the commuter with 2.5 kids or the mailperson or the Opera singer, etc....
