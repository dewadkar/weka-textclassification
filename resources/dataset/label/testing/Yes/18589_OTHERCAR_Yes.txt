            I have always loved Jaguars.  From the old '69 roadsters to the new Xk8's, they seem to get everything right.  The 1992 XJS convertible is no exception...

This car is a definite head turner!  Its long nose and delicate curves, (yet simple design) makes everyone take a second glance.  Also, the interior is exceptional, the best I have ever seen.  From the walnut woods to the fancy leather, the interior design is exsquisite.  I have not recieved one negative remark about this car, from ANYONE!!  

Driving this car is just as fun as viewing the it.  The 1992 XJS's were fitted with powerful V12 engines, which gives this car the ability to ZOOM!! (the top speed is around 155mph or so.)  The raw power at your foot is amazing, and might surprise novice drivers.  

If you buy this, you definitly want the convertible model.  The most fun is cruising around on weekends with the top down, with the wind in your face.  Also, the convertible models are much more attractive than the hardtops.

There are only three bad things to say about this car, two of which are  handling and mileage. This car probably handles better than 90% of the cars out there, but still doesn't live up to what I envisioned it to.  Also, in a time where gas prices are skyrocketing, this car can easily run you 50 bucks a week on gas (the V12 swallows gas at about 14 mpg!) One more thing, if you are taller than 6 foot 3 inches, you might have a tough time getting in and out of this car.

I very much encourage you to go out and test drive this car.  The price is an wonderful bargain at about 15-22k.  Why settle for a 20,000 Toyota Corolla when you can get a Jaguar for the same price?? Beware: once you sit in the seat, you will be very reluctant to leave the dealership without buying this car!!  Happy Driving!!!!<br><br>
