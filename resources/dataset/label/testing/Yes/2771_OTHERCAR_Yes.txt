            My husband bought our new 1997, 4-door Jetta long before we had our daughter.  It is a great car in just about every single way, don't get me wrong.  We feel completely safe in this car.  It hugs the road, and we're not afraid of slipping and sliding all over the place when it rains.  We also don't need to slow down to 10 MPH when making sharp turns for fear that we'll be taking those turns on two wheels.  (This is a feature my husband especially enjoys!  Me--not so much!)  Our only complaint is that it is TOO SMALL.  It's bigger than the newer Jettas that have since hit the market, but now with a baby, we really need more room than this car has to offer.

It's very tight in the back seat with a carseat now.  Since our daughter is only a few months old, I still ride in the back with her.  Even after moving the front passenger seat all the way up, I'm only somewhat comfortable, and I am an average-sized person.  Before we had the baby, we rarely had passengers in the the back seat, but when we did, they did say that it was a bit tight.  Also, we really need more trunk space now. Shopping trips have become a real hassle now.  The stroller.  The bags.  The need to take large items out of their boxes because they won't fit in the trunk.  Oh, well.

It has become necessary for us to consider purchasing a larger second car.  We don't want to get rid of the Jetta, though, because it IS a great car, and because of its reliability, it's the perfect car for my husband to drive to work every day.<br><br>
