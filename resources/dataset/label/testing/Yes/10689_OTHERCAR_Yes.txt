            I wasn't in the market for a new car yet, but once I saw this car, I had to have it.  
The style is so different from any car I had. I am not a car connoisseur, but it appears that all the other model cars seem to be alike (body wise) except for the price. 
This car is not only different, its affordable. The other models which are similar to this one, I found, are more expensive and don't come as well equipped. 

I chose the XR 4WD. Drives great. Doesn't feel like a small car (not light in weight). I don't know a lot about the mechanical aspects of a car, but to my experience so far, it shifts smoothly, feels sporty, breaks well, and is great on gas. It just feels right to me. 

My previous car had a 13 gallon tank but used more gas per mile.  This one has only an 11.9 gallon tank, but I find that I have to make less stops at the gas station then I did with the previous car. 

I did a lot of research on the web and got the information I needed. I compared this car with other similar models and found that you get more car for your money with the matrix than the other models. 

Being a woman, I didn't want to be taken advantage of, so I was armed and ready once I stepped into the showroom.  It has all the features that a more expensive car would have for a lot less. Standard equipment is quite impressive. I wanted a black matrix with certain options that a lot of dealers did not have in stock.  Rather than spending time going to different dealers, I wrote to them asking if they had the car in stock, equipped with the options I wanted, for the price I was willing to pay.  

Only one (Galaxy Toyota) responded to my letter.  Even then, I had to haggle, but was pleased with the end result. I got a fully equipped car, with driver & passenger side airbags, premium am/fm w/6 CD changer & 6 speakers (nice), extra value package 2, preferred accessory package, Custom Graphics and to close the deal they installed the alarm with remote starter and wheel locks. A nice perk to have when it is snowing or icy out.

I truly love driving this car and plan to keep it for a long time.  I test drove the more expensive cars they had on the lot but still liked the matrix the best (for what I could afford). 

The engine is a bit noisier than the Camry but you get accustomed to it and it doesn't seem to bother you. And most sporty cars have louder engines. The dash board is nicely situated.  Easy to read, sporty looking and I even got used to the red lights on the dash. Once you get accustomed to where everything is, you can do it without looking.  Everything is within reach.

This is my first 4 cylinder car and I was a bit concerned with the pick up, but once I test drove it, my concerns were put to rest.  I can enter the highway and keep up with the flow of traffic with ease. However, the real test will come once the snow and ice is upon us.  Then I'll see what this car can really do. I hope this car handles as well in inclement whether as it does on nice days. Although a nice car, my Alero did not handle well in snow and/or rain. That's the main reason I wanted an AWD.

My only concern is that the car is low to the ground and you have to be especially careful when parking not to get to close to the curb to the side or in front of you. I have become completely conscious of this and take extra care when parking. I also hope that this does not become a hindrance in the deep snow. 

Being only 5 feet tall, this car has an advantage because you can adjust the seat to fit your needs whether you are 5 feet or 6 feet and there is a lot of head and leg room to spare. The only disadvantage I found so far is the sun visor is small and being as short as I am, it does not block out the glare of the sun as it is setting. 

The back seat is just as roomy and comfortable and the best part is the fold down seats which allows you to shop till you drop. 

For those of you who are not ready for, or do not necessarily need an SUV, this CUV is the next best thing. I call it my "cute utility vehicle."
