            We have owned our 99 Intrepid for about three weeks. It replaced a 94 Pontiac Grand Prix. We have found that the Intrepid is much more comfortable than the Grand Prix even though it does not have all of the &quot;goodies&quot;. I, personally , have found that the handling and power are at least equal to the Grand Prix, but the smooth ride and comfortable seating far exceed that of the Grand Prix. The heater controls, radio controls and cruise control are very convenient, and easily within reach of the driver. Thus far, the only things that I have to complain about are the lack of standard features such as keyless entry and power seat. This car is designed for the middle income person who enjoys the luxury car ride. <br><br>
