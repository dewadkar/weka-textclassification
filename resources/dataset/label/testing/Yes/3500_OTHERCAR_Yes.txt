            I always thought that I had a keen appreciation for good cars.  As a young woman I chose Sports Cars and thought I would never be happier than when rounding steep curves in my little Porsche, later Z, 'Vette, etc.  However, as a mature woman who drives a minimum of 500 miles per week, I have finally found my perfect transportation.  

My Mercedes E320 (&quot;Ruby&quot;) that I bought new 3 years ago this month is without a doubt the finest automobile I have driven.  This fine example of perennially good German engineering offers comfort, handling, acceleration, and safety with which I'm really impressed.  In a weekly trip that could be considered boring, I'm entertained by the fine CD/stereo system (my only option), soothed by the comfortable leather seats, excited by the quick response to my right foot on the accelerator, and repeatedly impressed by the exacting handling.  

As for the safety factor, the low center of gravity and weight of the E320 and the solid construction saved me from a potentially fatal accident this time last year when a storm dumped ankle-deep water over a stretch of I-10 in Louisiana and I hit that spot at the same time as an 18 wheeler.  The only body damage to the E320 after that event was a dent in a back quarter panel and a broken light. The serious damage was to the electrical system as I sat in a flooded ditch (as the water rose) for over 3 hours until the State Troopers could get to me.  During that time, the trunk remained dry and the passenger compartment of the car was flooded only when I had to climb out to wade to the troopers.  I credit my Mercedes, &quot;Ruby&quot;, with saving my life and I would recommend this fine car to anyone who's looking for quality and safety. <br><br>
