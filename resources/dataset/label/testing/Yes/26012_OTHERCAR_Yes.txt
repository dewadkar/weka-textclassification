            If you're looking for WHAT YOU NEED, the Chevy cavalier is it.  My wife and I traded in our high payment, 2-door, 98 Monte Carlo for a 2000 Cavalier.  Yes it was a downgrade, but we had to add a couple of doors and cut our car payment.  Yes I miss the power of the Monte's 3.8, but I can honestly say that our Cavalier is more fun to drive.  I didn't say the car was as nice, but it is more fun to drive.

We purchased the LS with the 2.4L quad four with the four speed auto.  This is a very peppy power plant, the same used in the Z-24.  I've actually been satisfied with the pickup.  However, it's not the quietist engine.  Also, this is the BEST SHIFTING AUTOMATIC I have ever had. No kidding.  The computer controlled transmission shifts almost like a manual, always having the shift points at the right place.

Our LS came fully loaded, with a five year monthly payment of around three hundred and thirty eight bucks.  The car has all the goodies: keyless entry, cd sound system, auto, power locks, power windows, tilt, cruise, etc.  I'm amazed at the features.

For the money, and practicality with a little bit of fun, the Cavalier is a good buy.  It's not top of the line, nor is it designed to be.  But, for the value minded consumer, say anybody with a couple of kids and a real-world income, it's a good deal. 

OK, What don't I like? The engine can be noisy, especially when you put your foot in it.  The wheel covers - I should of got the alloys.  It's got more room than you would expect, but a rear facing child seat can hinder your front seat position if you are a tall driver.  The insurance isn't as cheap as one would expect, something about high collision repair costs.  That's about it.

Again, it is fun to drive.  I've actually beat some (Tuner) Honda Civics and CRX's off the line.  I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.  The Cavalier has left me grinning a few times.  Hey I may have kids, but I still have a 150 HP in a Cavalier.<br><br>
