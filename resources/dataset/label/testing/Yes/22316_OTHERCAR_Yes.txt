            I recently just bought resale my first car, a 1993 Eagle Summit ES Sedan. I have been extremely pleased with the performance and quality of the car. This review will be divided into categories in order to provide the most direct rundown of my opinion and facts about the car. I hope you enjoy it!

<b>Styling</b>
1993 is the model year Mitsubishi redisigned the Mirage/Summit/Colt. (A fact some may not know, Mitsubishi manufactured all three, with Chrysler Corp. selling it under the names Eagle Summit and Dodge and Plymouth Colt. Mitsubishi, of course, sold it as the Mirage) Previously it was a hatchback, the redesign not only gave it a regular trunk, it also greatly modernized the car's appearance. I think they did an excellent job. When I first saw the car I expected it to be at least a 1995 model year build, so it really surprised me to learn it was a 1993. The car is sleek, not overly sleek so it looks outdated, but rounded. The rear spoiler really adds to the car's appearance. The only thing about the exterior's styling I don't like is the size of the wheels. At 14" they are a little small looking, and had they been even 15 or 16" it would have made the car look all the more better. It also would improve handling, something I will discuss in a moment.

<b>Interior</b> 
The cabin of the Eagle Summit is a carbon copy of the cabin of the Mitsubishi Mirage and the Dodge/Plymouth Colt. There were no modifications made for any of these cars' interiors. They all are identical, save for Mitsubishi's application of the Diamond Star logo on their Mirage steering wheel. By comparison, and this bothers me, there is no logo on the steering wheel, something I find sort of cheap and that I wish I could fix, but I'll live. In any case, the interior is very nicely done, I think. It isn't the highest quality, but it's very clean and looks good. My car was in immaculate condition when I bought it, and so the exterior and interior both looked practically new (and looked even better once I detailed it) The only thing wrong with the interior when I bought the car was that the headrests on the rear seats were split at the seam. Interestingly enough, I have actually seen a few pictures of Eagle Summits on the internet with that same problem. I had my sister sew them for me, and so they look as good as new. 

The car has motorized seat belts for both driver and front passenger. The rear passengers on both driver and passenger sides get Three-Point seat belts (if you purchase a Canadian model all seat belts will be three-point, I'm assuming due to a Canadian law) The motorized belts only support the chest so there is an independent lap belt. Personally, I find three-point belts much more comfortable and convenient, but it's cool to have the motorized belts.

In the sedan, the rear seats will fold down to give easy access to the trunk and provide extra room for long objects. The trunk is very large for a subcompact sedan, so there is a lot of storage space. 

As for passenger room, the front offers comfortable accomodation for two average sized adults. I've never felt cramped, though I'm not a large person, so If you're 6'4" you just might be, as you would in any subcompact. I found the rear passenger room surprisingly roomy for a subcompact, comfortably seating 2 and even accomodating 3 if needed, though I would hate to be three full sized adults back there for a New York to California road trip!

<b>Ride Quality and Performance</b>
Here is where we get to the actual ride and performance aspects of the Eagle Summit. My car is a sedan, so it came with the larger engine, a 1.8 Liter 16 Valve that can get 113 horsepower. The coupes come standard with a 1.2 Liter that gets 93 hp. Still, 113 hp is not very much, but I'm not out there to race my friend's Acura RSX so it doesn't bother me. 

What does bother me is the acceleration. You'll find yourself eating the dust of many a motorist in the Summit. It's a little embarassing at stoplights when the light turns green that it takes forever to get up to everyone else's speed as the cars behind you grow impatient and pass. I've noticed that it takes forever to get to about 30-35 mph but once you've reached that "milestone," acceleration quickens considerably. Not every car was designed to go 0-60 in 6 seconds, this definitely was one of them. 

The ride of the car is very solid, I think. Once you get to a certain speed, about 55 mph, you'll feel the car start to get a little shaky, but that's because it's so light and small. I've had this happen in larger vehicles like a Dodge Caravan, so I really don't hold this against it. You always feel in control of the car, in fact I felt immediately comfortable with the handling the minute I sat behind the wheel.

Cornering is one of the only poor spots in terms of control. Due to the relatively small tires, you definitely need to make sure you don't take corners too quickly, or everything and everyone in the car will start to slide. 

Braking isn't extremely responsive, meaning you can't just tap the brake and have the car stop on a dime. Then again, acceleration isn't very responsive either. However, the car slows considerably fast by just taking your foot off the gas. You just need to press firmly on the brake to stop. ABS was an option on the Summit in 1993, but the owner of the car before me apparently decided not to get it.

Options I did get were power steering (yes, power steering was an option, believe it or not!) and cruise control. Steering, I might add, is responsive and I don't notice much oversteer at all. 

Finally, while driving at higher speeds there will be road noise. This is common in cars of its size and year, so it loses no points from me. It can be a little irritating, and everyone wants a dead quiet ride, but it's acceptable and the noise is kept moderate and under control. 

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
I do a LOT of stop and go driving. My car usually only goes about five miles to and from school every day, for a total of about 10 miles a day. The constant ignition really will guzzle gas a lot more than steady highway driving. However, getting gas is not a regular occurance for me! I've filled up a total of three times (I'm on my third tank) since I bought the car in November. On the two times I've been able to average gas mileage, both were over 20 mpg, my first tank was worse than my second tank, which I wound up getting 27 mpg from due to a long drive I took on it. So I roughly average out between 180-200+ miles per tank. But I think my car's gas tank had air in it from being idle for a while between the time the owner gave it up and I bought it, and I've begun seeing better mileage. But hey, the car's 10 years old and mileage is really great. I want to take it on a long trip and really see how good it can get, and I think it can push out some extraordinary mileage numbers!

<b>Problems</b>
Overall, from my time with the car I haven't had any significant problems. Those I have had I'll discuss here, and honestly, they're incredibly trivial. I wouldn't even include them here, but I feel sort of inclined to include any 'problems' I've had or noticed. 

The first, as I mentioned above, were the seats in the back had ripped seams. Believe me, this is hardly a problem, and can easily be fixed. I believe it is due to the sun constantly hitting the rear seats and weakening the seam a bit. I had this fixed the very day I bought the car, and that was that.

The second happened about two weeks ago. My cigarette lighter outlet suddenly broke. I had one of those Ionic Breeze things for your car in there, and in order to use the cupholder I had to take it out. It didn't fit in there very easily, and it was difficult to remove it as well. One day I must have wound up breaking a spring or something in there so now it no longer will power anything. It's of my own doing, so I have no one to blame but myself, and I don't blame the car. But I do blame the Ionic Breeze!

Well, that about sums up my overall opinion of my car. I absolutely love it. It has been and hopefully will continue to be a great car, one I can depend on and enjoy owning. Now, the quality of each used car will vary with the attention and care each owner gives it. I've been fortunate enough to get a car that was taken extremely good care of. Being someone who babies everything he owns (you should see how clean the car is, people say I have the cleanest car they've ever seen- the highest compliment for me, since I work so hard to keep it looking great!) I've made the car look even better. It definitely is a car that will serve me well until it's time to move on to a better, new car, which is my goal for the future. Until then, I'll definitely enjoy my Eagle Summit, and I hope if you have one or are considering purchasing one that you do too!
