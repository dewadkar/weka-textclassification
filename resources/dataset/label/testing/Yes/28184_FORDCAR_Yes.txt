            Actually, that is 410,000 miles in the 3 Taurus's that I have owned, and would buy another one.  The first one was a 1987.  The only problems that I had with it were all fixed by Ford, and I never spent a dime on repairs on it.  Unfortunately, while in Charlotte one fine New Years Eve, we were hit on the drivers side by a passing car.  The damage was quite extensive, but we were fine, and were able to continue driving it home.  I hardly felt the impact of the other car, so that's says something right there.  We were not even sure that we had been hit until we pulled over.  

The car had 160,000 miles on it at that time, and we decided to trade. We went with another Taurus.  This one was a 1990.  Never had any problems out of this one either until one day, (130,000 miles later), I noticed a shaking that was bad enough to stop me at the next garage.  It just so happened that it was a Ford dealer.  I did need some repairs to the front end, but I decided to just go ahead and trade that day.  I bought another Taurus.  This one was purchased new, 1995.  This is the one that I still have.  I have had no problems until just in the last month, and we are up to 120,000 miles on this one.  We had to have the head gasket replaced, but that is the first time it has had anything done to it other that oil changes and brake pads.  

In all of those miles, I have only been stranded one time.  I think that is a pretty impressive track record considering the miles I drive.  I am a home health nurse, and the driving conditions are not the best.  A lot of those miles were on less than desirable roads!  

My hobby is antiques, and I love to go to auctions.  I have been amazed at how much stuff I can fit into my Taurus.  The trunk is huge!  Now keep in mind, I am talking about a 1995 Taurus, not one of the newer ones.  I can fit more stuff into the trunk, back seat, and front seat of my Taurus that I can in the back of a truck.  I am not kidding, I have done it, and just had room for me to drive.  I have amazed more that one person at an auction house at the amount of stuff that I can haul!  

I can also say that the Taurus handles very well.  At speeds of 50-60 miles an hour, the handling is much better than in other cars and trucks that I have driven.  I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good used car, that is if you can find one!  The car lots that I have checked at tell me that they cannot keep the older Taurus in stock, and they sell them very fast.  

If you want a good used family car, I would recommend highly! <br><br>
