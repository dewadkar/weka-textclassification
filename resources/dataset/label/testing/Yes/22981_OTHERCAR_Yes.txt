            My husband and I have been looking for a digital camera for a few months, and 2 weeks before Christmas, Walmarts had the Polaroid PhotoMax on sale for $149.99. It is regularly priced $169.99.  We wanted one that had a built in flash, and also to hold a good amount of pictures.  We were also looking for one with a very easy program for putting the pictures onto the computer.  We found all that and more with this camera.  It is called the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC 640 Plus, digital camera creative kit, and has the following features:
               640 X 480 Standard  resolution
               Large LCD and Optical viewfinders
               8 MB Smartmedia card
               Autoflash (with auto/off/fill/red-eye options)
               Macro, Close-up, and Normal focal range
               Tripod Mount
               Self Timer

There are also four different settings for Image quality.  You can choose from these as needed:  
  
    Super High      640 X 480 Pixel resolution 
                    minimal JPEG compression 
                    stores up to 45 images on card
                    Best Image Quality

    HIGH            640 X 480 Pixel resolution 
                    medium JPEG compression 
                    stores up to 90 images on card
                    Good Image Quality

    Standard        640 X 480 Pixel resolution
                    high JPEG compression 
                    stores up to 142 images on card
                    Fair Image Quality
 
    LOW             320 X 240 Pixel resolution 
                    NO JPEG compression
                    stores up to 330 images on card
                    Best for images used online only
                      (web, email, etc........)

The actual kit includes:
      PDC 640 Plus Digital Camera
      PhotoMax IMage Maker Software CD
      batteries
      PC and TV (ntsc/pal) cables
      Wrist strap &amp; case
      Online Users guide
      Quickstart guide


This camera is very easy to use, but can go thru some batteries.  You can take pictures using the AC plug adaptor to help save on the batteries.

One feature my boys love is that the kit includes a hookup so you can view the taken pictures on your TV.  This is also nice when you have a housefull and everyone wants to see the pics.

I would say this was a great camera and value for the money spent, we are very very happy with this camera.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves to take pictures, and hates or forgets to take film to be developed.
