            In Feb. I bought a 2000 Forester S (cold-weather package) after driving a Ford Explorer Sport for 4 years. After 4 months and 10K miles, I'm quite happy with the purchase. I get a lot of the advantages of an SUV (though less of some) without their worst disadvantages. On the whole the Subaru drives much better than the Ford, but it's less stylish. You can love or hate the Ford's looks, but it was well designed on the interior, was great to sit in, and generally felt like a quality vehicle - in the driveway, that is. The Subaru is definitely not a stylish car, but it drives much much better.

I was in the market solely for a 4WD, mostly because they're so much better in snow and have so much storage space. Also, I have a big dog and wanted a car with a separate &quot;dog compartment&quot; in the way back. And I was thoroughly tired with the Ford's incredibly rough ride, instability, and terrible gas mileage. But these are all faults common to truck-based SUV's, so I wanted one that's car-based. There isn't much to choose from, but  I've had good experiences with both Hondas and Subarus (both very reliable and long lived). My choice was between the Forester or the CRV. I don't like the looks of either very much, though I get a soft spot for my car once I've gotten to love it. Like a parent, I suppose. 

I chose the Forester over the CRV because it has much more power and is safer. The CRV drives a lot like my old Civic, but higher up. The acceleration is just too sluggish - hard to merge on highways or pass. And the engine was noisy, especially at highway speeds. The Forester drives beautifully. You've still got some of the &quot;command position&quot; feeling of an SUV - though less than a truck-based one - but you can actually corner and brake like a car. I just didn't feel safe turning sharply or stopping in the Ford. And I was very impressed with the crash test and roll-over data on the Subaru.

Other good things about the Forester: great visibility, handling, and some nice conveniences (sunglasses holder, several useful storage compartments - and a couple of useless ones, nice optional sound system). All in all, it's a good, tough mountain goat of a car, great for carrying around a dog (at least one big enough to hop in the back), fun to drive but not at all luxurious. 

It feels like it gets twice the gas mileage of the Ford, but also like it has half the storage space. I'm sure both feelings are exaggerated.

However, the car has some small but annoying problems.

1. Cupholders. They're terrible - cheaply made and ineffective. OK, it's not the most important complaint in the world; that's why I bought the car and why I'm happy with it. Still, it would be so easy to improve.

2. Remote keyless entry. This thing just gives me fits. First, it's badly engineered: you have to hold down the button to unlock all the doors (other than the driver's). It's so much easier to double-click. But the real problem is that holding the button down only works about 50% of the time. And this is the second unit I've had in the car! The first broke after one day. There's something wrong with the whole feature.

3. Couldn't they have made it a bit better looking?

With any luck they'll fix these problems after the car has been around for another year or so, and I'll envy the latest model.
