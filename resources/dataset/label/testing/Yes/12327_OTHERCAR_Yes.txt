            This makes the second eclipse I have owned,  the first.....  was a 1998 Eclipse GS.  My second was the one I bought last week,  Since then I am very pleased with my purchase.  I did love my last one,  but the new 2000 has grown in quality.  The handling of this vehicle is awesome.  It feels like you are driving on air,  and the affordable sportiness of this car is enough to make anyone want to buy one. If your one on speed,  then this is the car for you.  The eclipse can top speeds up to and over 100 in no time, there are few problems I encountered with this car,  one being the room in the cab,  if your a large person I wouldn't advise owning this.  There is hardly enough room for two small children in the back seat,  much less two average size adults,  which is a minus if you like having passengers.

This car would make any teenager,  or hip adult proud to drive!
I would recommend this car if your wanting to make an impression!

So why don't you go out today and test drive one for yourself.....  and you decide.<br><br>
