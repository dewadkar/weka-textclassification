            I used to own a 97 Intrepid Sport Edition with the 3.5L engine.  Even though I was single and it�s known as a family car it appealed to me because of the room and looks it had.

The 3.5L Engine was plenty for the car, had good acceleration and is very stable on the road.  Not like a smaller car where the wind can blow you around.  And what can I say about the room, can fit very comfortably two large people in the front and three in the back.  Or if you�re traveling it has plenty of space in the back seat and trunk for storage.  

If I could change one thing it would be to have a fold down back seat which would really make use of all the room you have.  I had the car from 75k to 100k miles and never had any mechanical problems with it.  

As far as finding a large car that you won't look bad in driving with or without a family, an Intrepid is your kind of car.   It has a sleek look to it and doesn't look like an ordinary family car.
