                 If you must buy used... you can't beat this car.  I bought a '93 Legend L brand new, and 7 years and 92K miles later, I still love this car as much as ever.  If you need to buy a used car, I could greatly recommend this car.  I still drive my car with pride, and it rides and accelerates almost as good as new.

      There are too many good things to say about this car to single out one aspect as &quot;the best.&quot;  I would have to start with reliability.  the only problem that I've had with this car was my antenna doesn't work well and dropping the window has slowed down.  (Both are easily fixable, but I'm waiting until something bigger goes wrong to get everything taken care of at once.)  The exterior styling is truly timeless.  I still think that it is one of the sharpest cars on the road.  The interior is classic Japanese... simple and elegant.  Everything is right where you can get to them, and there are no bells and whistles.  The engine is still running great w/ quick acceleration and smooth gear shifts.  The car is heavy and has a solid feel, but it still handles great on the hills and curves of Pittsburgh.  It's also great in the winter because it's front-wheel drive, so ice &amp; snow are never really problems.  There is tons of room for everyone, and the trunk is huge.  The radio sounds great and has easy to use controls.

      While it's a great car, there are a few shortcomings.  The most notable would be the poor gas mileage.  My car has given me about 26 MPG on the highway, but that drops to 16-20 MPG of city driving.  To add insult to injury, my car requires premium fuel (although I think that the '91 model did not.)  With recent gas prices rising, this can be painful.  The other complaints are minor.  You can only get a 6-disc CD changer in the trunk.  These tend to skip over harsh roads and it's a pain to figure out what you'll be in the mood to listen to over a road trip before you step into the car.  Additionally, it doesn't display the time on the track.

      If you are considering buying this car, I think that you will find that you get alot of value.  You can't find a better blend of luxury and performance at a reasonable price.  To be honest, if they still made this car today, I would probably buy it again.  I think that it would compete well with the new Acura TL, I30, A6, and ES300.  It's lagging a little in terms of amenities (i.e. no heated seats, no traction control, memory seats don't include side mirrors, and has a manual day/night switch rear-view mirror), but the car is also 7 years old.

       This is an incredible car that is still one of the most stylish cars on the road today.  You can expect it take you from point A to point B in style and with comfort.  Can't beat it...<br><br>
