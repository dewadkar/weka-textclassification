            I've been yearning for an SUV for about 5 years now, but just could never bring myself to spend the money on one of them.  Now that I have a new Jeep, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to get one!  I love the look of an SUV, and was really interested in the Dodge Durango (I must admit, I love their commercials with the man in glasses that calls himself a dufus!)  After spending hours on carpoint.com, I decided that the Jeep was a better buy, and just plain looks cooler.  

My sister-in-law manages a Jeep dealership, so driving hers for a day helped us make up our minds.  We decided that if we were going to buy a Jeep, we were going all out, and got the Limited Edition, fully loaded.  The only thing that our Jeep doesn't have is the GPS tracking system, and that's because we didn't hear about it until after we had our Jeep back home.  (We bought it about 800 miles from where we live.)  The weekend after driving it home, we drive it to West Virginia, in the mountains, for Thanksgiving.  It handled excellent in the cold and was climbing mountains like they weren't even there.  The acceleration of the V8, 4.2L engine is amazing.  And, the roar of the engine sounds great too!  The Quadra Drive feature is also something that is worth mentioning.  If one of the four wheels loses traction, the differential automatically diverts power to the other 3 wheels.  Other models offer this sort of thing, but it's normally done by the axles, not by each wheel.  I haven't needed it yet, but you can bet my husband will take it off road as soon as I'm out of town.

I love all of the options that are available on the Limited and the way that it drives.  The keys also have a rolling code that reinitializes every time you start the engine, so no one with a copy of your key can start the Jeep.  The remotes being linked to seat positions is also great, my husband is 6'4&quot;, and I'm only 5' tall, so if he were to get in there after I had driven, he'd probably hurt himself!  All he has to do is unlock the door with his remote, and the seat/mirror/radio all go back to his settings.  Also, with the Limited, the spare tire is an actual tire, with a matching wheel/rim thing, instead of a pseudo-tire that would come with most cars.  The only thing I don't like so far is that the 10 disc changer is in the back, and is a little hard to get to on road trips, without climbing around in the backseat.  I'm sure there will be other things as I drive it, but nothing yet.

Driving the Grand Cherokee is amazing!  It drives like a well-tuned car.  It handles great, and has a tighter turning radius than a lot of cars I've driven.  It has great pickup, and I beat a Camaro off of the line at a light the other day.  It also cruises down the highway at 90 without feeling like you're going much over 50.  The ride is very comfortable, wherever you're sitting.

The only person I would not recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee to is anyone over 6'4&quot;.  My husband has to recline the seat back pretty far so his legs aren't cramped under the steering wheel, but it doesn't bother him too much since the settings are moved for him.  Oh, and the lumbar support in the seats is incredible!  It makes long trips a breeze!<br><br>
