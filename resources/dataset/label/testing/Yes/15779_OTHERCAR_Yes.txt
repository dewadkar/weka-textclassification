            I have now had my Prius for just over 1 year.  Overall, I am very happy with it.  95% of my driving is rush hour start-stop driving, so the good gas mileage really is important.  However, the gas mileage is not quite up to the estimates posted; I get an average of 40 MPG.  Actually, considering that I live in Phoenix and have to drive with the A/C on most of the time, I'd say that's still pretty good.  The car is nimble moving in and out of traffic and is definitely easy to park (I can even parallel park this car -- no easy feat for me!)  The seats are so ergonomically correct that I wish I could have a seat like that at my computer.  I'm only 5'2, so seat adjustments are very important so that I can reach the pedals without having to scoot the seat so far up that I'm leaning on the steering wheel.  My ex rides in my car frequently, and at over 300 pounds, even he can sit comfortably and use the seat belt without needing a seat belt extender.  I have put people over 6' tall in the rear seat; they didn't have to sit with their knees up to their shoulders; quite a feat for a small car!  My biggest complaint:  the center console does not come up high enough to serve as an armrest. My only other gripe:  the cup holders only work with smaller cups; large bottled waters or sodas don't fit.  This car is so quiet when in the electric mode that you have to look at the dashboard to be sure it is still running; but the positioning of the display in the center of the dashboard really makes sense - no having to look down to see it and then back up to watch the road.  The touchscreen display is fun to show off and easy to use.  I initially had a problem with the audio display, but my Toyota dealer promptly ordered the necessary part and called me when it arrived.  Having a good service department is a must!  Because of the hybrid engine, most mechanics would have a hard time figuring out what is what and how to fix it.  The service department at the dealership I go to is great; I even have a personal service advisor to call who knows who I am (and I'm in the 6th largest city in the US!)  I would not recommend getting this car if you have any doubts about the service department where you shop.  Oh, and by the way, I originally went to the dealership to look at their pickup trucks since my previous one was stolen.  I wasn't even looking for small cars, but my curiosity got the best of me when i saw "hybrid" on the car.  Once I sat in the car and then took it for a test drive I was hooked.  Yeah, the space in a pickup would be nice, but I have no intentions of getting rid of this car any time soon.
