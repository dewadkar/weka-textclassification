            I purchased this car about 8 months ago and must say I am totally pleased with it. I had a 2000 Honda Civic EX before but needed something with 4 doors and having the rear hatch sold me on the Spectra. With the rear seats folded down there is plenty of room for cargo. I am not here to bash the Civic but I have to say that overall the Kia outperforms the Civic easily. That might be hard for some of you to believe but seriously drive a Civic and then compare a Spectra. The one thing that impresses me the most about the Spectra over the Civic is its ease to drive. With the Honda I had to rev the heck out of the car to extract any type of decent speed. With the Kia and the close gear ratios of the 5 spd transaxle you can drive moderate and still achieve excellent acceleration. I just got tired of having to drive the Civic so hard around town. 

The way the Spectra handles is another strong point. With a Lotus tuned suspension and front AND rear anti-sway bars, the Spectra remains composed and stable in corners. The only minus I can find is the tires which just don't have enough traction  and side stability for me. In fairness though I had the same issue with the Honda and after replacing the Firestones with Yokohamas it totally changed the manners of that car, and I suspect the same with the Kia. 

The brakes work very well with no fade after several hard stops. My Spectra does not have anti-lock brakes and so far I have not locked any of the wheels in hard braking.

Inside the Spectra is quite comfortable for this class of car. The seats are SO MUCH better than the Civic. I used to hate to take the Honda on long trips because of its hard flat seats and the material after 6 months started wearing out on the Civic. The seat material and cushioning is definately higher quality on the Kia. The dashboard on the Spectra is attractive and easy to see. All the controls are easy to get to. The only places that Kia skimped some seem to be the plastic door panels and the headliner and carpet seem on the cheap side but hey this IS a under $11,000 car!

One other thing to point out if you like doing your own engine service is that the 1.8L engine is quite easy to work on. I have changed the oil and filter and didn't even need a filter wrench to remove the old filter. Just reached down behind the engine and spun it off by hand! Everything else is pretty easy to get to as well.

Overall I must say that this is a great little car and as far as some of the other reviewers have said about Kia's reliability as they get older, take a look on the road and see how many Ford Festiva's and Ford Aspires (both made by Kia for Ford) and you may be surprised. Most of those cars are over 10 years old and still run great. I have known several people with them that say they are very happy.
