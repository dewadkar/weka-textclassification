            OK, no joke.  I've only both the Sony P7 and the Canon S230 in the past 3 weeks.  I took both of them back and thought maybe I should give up on a new digital camera for now.  That is, until I came across the Minolta.  I'm so glad I found this camera!  It's everything I wanted and more, and I found it for LESS than the other two brands!

The Sony took pictures that were fuzzy on the outside, like I shot them with a softening filter.  The totally unusable software was insulting to me as a customer, for them to think we would be happy with that from a quality name like Sony!  I also thought charging the battery inside the camera, by attaching the 2 cables (one of which is bulky) was such a hassle.

The Canon, on the other hand, took pretty good pictures (not as good as the Minolta, but I was satisfied with them at the time).  But for a $400 camera, it has no date imprint!  You have to use their software to apply the date!  Seeing as I sometimes print right from my memory card and don't even use my PC, this is completely unacceptable!

Why do I like the Minolta so much?  Read on!

*It's 4 megapixels instead of 3 like the other two cameras were.

*It features a separate LCD screen from your subject viewing LCD screen, that shows all your camera settings.  You can still show them in your main LCD if you want.  Nice feature if you don't want your subject view cluttered with settings!

*It does have a movie mode with sound, but in addition to that you can also attach a voice memo to any photo!  

*You can use AA batteries, or rechargeables.  But the CR-V3 battery works great and I wouldn't even consider AA's or rechargeables.  My Kodak used the CR-V3 and they last months.  They don't drain fast like others would want you to think.  Really!  They aren't expensive, so it's easy to just keep a separate one handy.

*If you are a Windows XP user, you will have to download a software version update from Minolta.com to transfer photos.  But it all went smooth.

*There's manual settings for those that like that.  My pictures in auto are crisp and beautiful!  I am SO HAPPY with them!

*I found this camera online from a major department store,(Walmart.com) with an extra 64mb card and case, for only $377!  LESS than the Sony and Canon, which are $400!  :-D  

*My only complaint:  you must have the camera in manual mode for a date stamp.  I don't understand why this is.  But I just put the camera in manual mode and don't change any of the settings.  It works great!

*Of course, as with any digital camera, the standard 16mb memory is insufficient.  Buy more.

Please give this camera a look if you are considering either the Sony or Canon.  I'm so glad I found it and made this purchase!  It blows the competition away!  I can't understand why it isn't getting more attention.  I did notice that some major electronics stores don't carry Minolta, which may be part of the reason it's our hidden little gem.  Good thing for online resources!

You won't be disappointed with this camera - promise!
