            I bought a Honda Odyssey after my Toyota Sienna was lost to Hurricane Floyd.  I have found the Odyssey to be dependable and a great drive. It sits lower than the Sienna and there is more interior room. Its standard features exceed the extras on the Sienna.  There was a blind spot over my left shoulder in the Sienna...not so with the Honda.  I find the automatic doors quite handy though they take some getting used to.  The first month, someone attempted to manually close a door when the door was shutting on its own causing it to shift off track.  This required a trip to the dealer.  There has been a recall on the Odyssey involving the insertion of a metal shield to prevent a hose from overheating and causing damage to the engine.  Recently, my engine light has come though the fluids are fine.  The manual says this indicates a fuel emission problem.  I have another appointment with the dealer.

I bought the van to be able to haul furniture and large items since I love buying things at auctions.  I also wanted to be able to carry extended family members in one vehicle when going out together.  I like the idea of having the extra room for family trips.

Overall, I prefer the Odyssey over the Sienna.  It has great pick up and the visability is better.  The initial problems I have had have been minor.<br><br>
