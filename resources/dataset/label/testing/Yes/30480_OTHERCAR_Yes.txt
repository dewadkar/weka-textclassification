            I recently got a used Toyota Corolla from my grandmother.  It is an '88 corolla, so it's pretty old.  however the thing still works like a charm.  I nicknamed it the mousemobile after the only thing bad that has happened to it.  One winter, when we took it off the road because I had no real need for it that winter, some mice got in the engine and nested.  That was the only problem, was having to clean them out.  It wasn't too bad.  Some other things have gone bad on it like the tires just this year, but after 11 years, who can complain.  Toyota found something right in this car and probably their other models as well.  I recommend the Toyota corolla to anyone who is looking for a nice little car.<br><br>
