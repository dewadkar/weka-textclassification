            I only have one question for GM - why'd you stop making it? This has to be one of the most attractive cars, save for the Trans Am, to come out of Detroit in the past few years. It is amazing how Chevy could take a grandma car like the Caprice and turn it into such an attractive performance sedan. Combine blacked out chrome, sport rims, a Corvette engine, and a police car and you get the Impala SS. A friend of my family is a car dealer and he got one on the lot a year or so ago. He said that it is the closest thing to a classic muscle car that he had driven in many years. He even took it out on the highway and hit well over 150mph. 150mph in a BIG car! Any person who is into performance and American cars would be right at home behind the wheel of this car. <br><br>
