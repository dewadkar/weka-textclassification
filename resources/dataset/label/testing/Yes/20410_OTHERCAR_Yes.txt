            Yes, the seats of my car are a fuzz magnet.  That is my biggest and only complaint about my 2000 Jetta.  I take my dog with me quite often, and throw a blanket in the back.  The fuzzies from this blanket, and any thing that I am wearing that has fuzzies, stick to the fabric seats.  That's also my biggest maintenance issue - defuzzing!

Other than that, I absolutely love this car.  Before buying, I test drove a Civic EX, an Oldsmobile Alero, and the VW Beetle.  I had decided that after driving a sports car for years, that I was mature enough to handle something a little bigger, but still fun.  There's something about sitting behind the wheel of the car that just made you feel good compared to all the others.  Although not as large and bulky as the Alero, you feel like you're sitting in something substantial.  The seats are comfy in the front , although a little cramped in the back, with plenty of leg room (although the back seat passenger would be squished if you were <i>really</i> comfy.

Some of the specific things I love?  Heated side view mirrors defrost almost instantly on those frosty mornings.   Drink holders that are at steering wheel level, making that morning java easily accessible.  All of the trays for coins and trash (ash trays, I suppose), including the ones in the door panel, come out for easy cleaning.   If I leave the windows down or the sunroof open, I just stick the key in the lock and hold it until the windows go up.  Speaking of the key, it's a cool little deal that flips open like a switchblade (careful, kids love playing with this).  The security system, trunk, and locks are all accessible on the key.  (They need to put the gas tank release here too).  The trunk has an adapter for plugging in a cooler, etc.  Oh and did I mention the trunk is HUGE?  I could practically sleep in there!  The horn is the whole center of the steering wheel!  Not frantic searching for the horn.  And I pray that I'll never have to use them, but the Jetta has front <b>AND</b> side airbags.  Pretty cool.  Oh and the sound system... wow!  

Some things they could work on?  If you have a tall drink in the holder, it blocks the A/C vent.  There's a lighted mirror on each visor, but putting up the cover blocks the light.  Minor, though, I still love my car.

I didn't opt for the 6 cylinder model, but the 115hp engine gives me plenty of pep.  With a German car like this, I of course bought the 5 speed manual, and I love how smoothly it shifts.  It handled much better than any other car I drove.  Even a year after buying it, I love getting in my Jetta each morning!
