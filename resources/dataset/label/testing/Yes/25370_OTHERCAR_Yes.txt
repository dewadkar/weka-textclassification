            I love this camera--it is so much like a &quot;standard&quot; single-reflex lens camera.  It is very easy to use:  the LCD display on the back is very helpful for framing shots &amp; for viewing the photos after they are taken.  The display is small, but adequate. 

I am not pleased with the Agfa software for transferring the photos to the computer, tho.  I have had nothing but trouble with that. One reason I purchased this camera was because it had USB AND serial cable with it, so I could use it with both my iMac &amp; G3Powerbook.  Never use the cables &amp; the &quot;conventional&quot; method of transferring photos.  I bought the compact flash adaptor that goes into the PC slot of my Powerbook.  Now I just remove the compact flash from the camera, slip it into the PC adapter &amp; virtually slide the photos onto my Powerbook.  I recommend that method highly--much faster than either type of cable (if you can get the software to work).

This camera has digital zoom, which is not as good as the other zoom.  The digital zoom only works in low resolution mode, so is pretty worthless.  The zoomed pictures turn out really grainy.

The PhotoWise software to work with photos after they are in the computer is very nice, and also easy to use (just the &quot;download&quot; part of the software that isn't working for me).  Many corrections are possible with the software, as well as cropping, etc.

I would recommend this product to parents &amp; grandparents, pet owners, real estate agents, etc.  I don't think it's quite high end enough for professional use.  My kids can use it, and not waste any film.  Battery power is adequate, for awhile.  The batteries seem to run down very quickly, so be sure to get the AC adapter for use wherever you have electricity.  <br><br>
