            My favorite feature about this camera is that it utilizes regular computer disks rather than memory cards that have to be plugged in and down loaded.  With the Sony Mavica FD75, you just insert a disk, take pictures, then pop the disk into the computer.  With a few clicks of the mouse, you're viewing your pictures on the screen.  This feature makes it great for anyone who is a little computer shy and intimidated by alot of high-tech gadgets.

Because of the disk used, however, the Mavica FD75 is extremely bulky and awkward to carry around.  When we have taken the kids to Disney World or the beach (places where I'd love to get some nice digital photos), I've been afraid to bring the camera because it is so big and can easily be damaged.  I often wish I had a nice compact digital camera that could fit into a slim carrying case and be slipped into a backpack or purse.  

Using the camera is easy and great for any beginning photographers.  It's pretty straight forward point-and-shoot stuff.  The quality of the pictures is excellent and I've never been disappointed in that regard.  My photos are always sharp, in focus, and with great color.  The battery life seems to be short and I am constantly recharging or running out of battery in the middle of a photo-taking session.  There is virtually no shutter lag on this digital camera.  What you snap is what you get.
