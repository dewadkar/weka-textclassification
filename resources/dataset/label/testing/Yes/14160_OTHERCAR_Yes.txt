            I recently had the opportunity to drive a 2000 (maybe 1999, I'm not sure) AM General Hummer. It is by far one of the funnest things I have ever done in my life. One of my good friends from out of town came to visit this weekend and he brought his brand new Hummer with him. I was deeply impressed because I love 4x4 vehicles and off-roading. This was on of the best rides of my life. We took it off-roading and he even let me drive. There are several good things about this vehicle and a few bad things about it and I'll tell you about them here:

<b>Good:</b>

Like I stated in the title this vehicle can go anywhere and do anything. This weekend I watched this vehicle pull up to a 2 ft. high cement slab that went straight up and the Hummer scaled it like nothing. I was a very smooth ride as well. I've seen it climb a 6 ft. wall of vertical rock. I've seen this vehicle drive through 3 ft. of water without leakage. There is nothing that can top this type of agility in a vehicle. I know now why the army uses these vehicles in their line of duty. They literally will go anywhere.

There are a few reasons why the Hummer will go anywhere and do anything. First, I would have to credit the 430 lbs. of torque that this vehicle carries. Second, I would have to credit the 37 in. tires. Those are some big tires which allows for a substantial amount of ground clearance.  The real reason for the ground clearance though is due to the portal axles.  They reach the hubs above the center line of the tires which allows for maximum clearance.  Third, I would have to credit the suspension. This vehicle has such a wonderful suspension underneath it. 

Not only can this vehicle go everywhere but it's also a very stylish vehicle. It gets noticed everywhere it goes and causes tons of attention. The paint is very high quality and will never scratch which was proven this weekend when we literally drove over thorn bushes without a scratch. The seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of space to store objects when your out on the trail.

The headlights are very very bright for obvious reasons when your out on the trail. It seems as if you can see for miles and miles with these headlights. The vehicle is surprisingly smooth on the road as well. I would think that a vehicle used primarily for off-roading would be very bumpy on the highway but it's not. It rides smoother than any car on the highway. It is very easy to drive as well and it fells great sitting in the cockpit with the steering wheel in your hands just knowing how much power your holding. 

The Hummer comes equipped with full time four wheel drive so you never have to worry about stopping to engage 4wd. I love this convenient feature. The quality of the Hummer is great. It's built to fit the military standards which I might say are set very high. It must be strong for all of the off-roading and extremes that me and my friend put his through this weekend.

<b>Bad:</b>

The budget. Not everyone can own one with a base price set at $65,000. It also drains diesel fuel faster than you can put it in. We had to carry gas tanks with us to fill up while we were on the trail. The vehicle is also tremendously wide which makes for hard parking and other problems while driving in the city. 

There are several blind spots which are bad for safety. You have to practically stand in the seat to see if you can change lanes at times. Also the controls and gauges are far away. You have to reach around just to switch gears and to reach the radio controls. Speaking of radios, this one is horrible. They should have filled in this space with some North Star system or something else besides a radio because this one is worthless.

The horsepower is worthless which means that this vehicle is very slow. Getting 0-60 mph in somewhat shorter than a day (actually it's 17 seconds), acceleration is not a key point in this vehicle. If you ever need to go anywhere fast get another ride. The top speed is only 82 mph as well and it is electronically limited. 

Other than these few cons, this vehicle is ideal for any person. If I had the budget, I would have an AM General Hummer parked in my garage right now.
