            First of all, let me start by saying, I don't own this truck, my boyfriend does.  He Absolutely Loves it... So before writing this review I decided I would ask him his opinion.  Because I am a female and I'm not into all the mechanical part of things, I can't give that type of information, so that's where his view point comes in handy...

The reason he bought the truck, a <b>1999 F-150 XLT 4x4 shortbed, 5 speed, 4.6L V8.</b> is because he had previously had a 1997 F-150 and loved it, he never had a problem with that one, and his lease was up, so he ordered this one.  So far, no problems with this one either.

What he likes best about his truck is the that it has 4 wheel disc brakes which makes for great braking.  It has a 230 Hp triton 4.6L engine which means it's got great power. It handles great, and the suspension is very smooth and it rides quite nice.

What he dislikes about his truck is that it comes with small standard tires, and you can't get a standard transmission with a bigger engine.
With the F-150's you can only get a standard with 4.2L and 4.6L engines, but not with a 5.4L engine.

It's a great truck to drive, it doesn't drive like your average truck, it's much better handling, and you don't get that typical truck type of rough ride.  It has smooth acceleration.  Another good feature of this truck that I especially like, is that it has an on/off switch for the passenger side air bag for those who have small children.  You never know when a kid might get in your truck, there's no back seat to put them in, so it's a great feature.  It has a great sounding stereo if that counts for anything, and it's got a CD player instead of a tape deck.  Very nice, I must say.  

This would make a great truck for anyone looking for a nice riding truck to either pull a small trailer or if you just need or want a nice pick up. You should definitely consider the F-150.  There really isn't anyone who <b>shouldn't</b> buy one, <i>&quot;either you need a truck, or you don't&quot;</i> as my boyfriend says.

This truck has been used for hauling my boyfriends race car, going on road trips, and my boyfriend is very pleased with it.  I think it's very comfortable to ride in even for longer periods of time.  It's also a pretty quiet truck to ride in.  I'm impressed.  The looks of this truck alone impress me, I don't have any complaints either.  :)

Wow, I made it through the review, mechanical talk and all...  Thanks to my man! :)<br><br>
