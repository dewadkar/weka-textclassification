            I tested a 92 SC300 in August 1999.  I was looking for a quality set of wheels with a serious performance side.  Since I have always admired the Lexus SC's beautiful styling, I decided to see if it had what I was looking for.  

The SC300 I tested had 120k miles on the odometer, and was a 5 speed stick, which is a requirement for me.  It was finished in a beautiful dark candy-apple red paint that looked gorgeous on it.  The interior was pale tan leather with the darker brown plastic accents on the dash.  Very tasteful and elegant.  Fit and finish on the car were top of the line.  The seats were very comfortable, and the driving position was excellent.  After I sat down and acquainted myself with the controls, I found my first disappointment.  The plastic materials used around the dashboard area and the controls look high quality, but feel cheaper than they look.  When tapped, the plastics sounded like they were made of a thin, brittle material.  The center console armrest was made out of hard, brittle plastic, instead of the soft touch plastic you might expect for an armrest.  Interior room was fine up front, but very limited in back.  Only children would fit in the rear seats.  Cargo capacity is limited by the shallow trunk storage area.  I didn't try the stereo, so I can't comment on it.

So I started the car up and took it for a drive.  Here is where I met my biggest disappointment.  Although the SC looks like a performance vehicle from its styling, it does not deliver in its driving experience.  The 5 speed stick shift was very notchy and had excessively long throws.  The power output from the engine felt lethargic at all RPMs.  The brakes were slow to respond.  The steering felt disconnected from the road.  The body leaned excessively in corners.  Despite the fact that the SC is rear wheel drive, the cornering balance was heavy understeer at all times.  This car is clearly not intended for any sporty driving, period.  

My final verdict: while the SC300 has the body of a real looker, it is actually a couch potato in disguise.  Pass this one by if you value fun in your driving experience.<br><br>
