            I own a silver Accord EX V6 w/black leather. I got it in November and so far I'm loving it. It seems like a reliable, well put together car. It drives well and fast I might add. The handling is smooth and the brakes work really well. I love the "in dash" 6 CD Changer that it comes with, the speaker & sound system are awesome too. My CDs are played loud & clear. This car has heated front seats, passenger & driver. It also has passenger a/c & heat controls, as well as driver's own a/c & heat controls. You can also, change CD's, radio stations & volume from the steering wheel. This model also comes with automatic everything, sunroof, extra large trunk space, alloy wheels & more.

The only problem that I have experienced so far with this vehicle is that the back passenger door lock was pulled by my 4 yr old son and now it won't go down. The door still locks but the lock on top by the window won't go down. Also, I have automatic seats and the passenger one gets stuck from time to time, for no reason. 

Overall though, I love this car. This is my 3rd Honda. I had a Honda Civic EX in 1995, a Honda Accord Special Edition in 1997, I switched to a Nissan Maxima in 2000, and now I'm back with Honda. I wasn't to happy with the service or durability of the Nissan. 

If you live in Orange county, CA, I recommend that you buy your Honda from Costa Mesa Honda. They have great deals! This is my 2nd Honda from them. I'm paying $380/month for mine & that's with tax., 48 mo lease, 0 down. I only lease my cars, because I get tired of them so fast and want a newer model. But I'm sticking with Honda from now on, they have yet to let me down!
