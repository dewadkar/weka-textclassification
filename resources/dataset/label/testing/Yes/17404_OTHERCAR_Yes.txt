            After deciding my next vehicle would be an SUV, I decided on the 4Runner for several reasons.  First and foremost, I liked the looks of the 4Runner as compared to the more standard Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer, and especially liked some of its features which its competition lacked (e.g. the automatic rear window).  

I have had my 4Runner for almost 2 years and it has not had a single problem to date.  The only maintenance it has required is the occasional oil change, but it rides as well today as when I drove it off the dealer's lot 2 years and 24,000 miles ago.  Moreover, the car rides exceptionally well, especially for those of us who like to feel the road a bit when they drive, rather than glide along as though you were standing still as some of the other vehicles in this class may behave.  

Gas mileage is good, it handles well in both 2 and 4 wheel drive, the sound system is excellent, and, overall, the car was worth every penny.<br><br>
