            As a former Corvette owner I must say "Whoaaaa Baby."  This comes from a guy who buys a car about every 2 - 3 years.  I must say that the Cadillac Seville is the most complete car I have purchased yet.  I combines Cadillac luxury with Corvette like power.  I did say Corvette like (smile).  But really the Seville will out perform a lot of the so called sports cars on the market and the ride is so smooth I have to look out the window to see if I am actually moving.  The dashboard has the option of appearing in beautifully backlit analog or digital with the push of a button.  425 Watts of pure Bose quality stereo will out perform most of the high end aftermarket systems without the loose wires hanging all over the place.  As I said this is the most complete car for luxury styling and sports car performance that I have every owned and i have been through quite a few cars. Here is a list of cars that I have owned and feel that the Caddy is better than:  Mercedes 190E 16V, Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd (2), Nissan Maxima, Chevy Corvette, Chevy Camaro V6, Chevy Z28 IROC Z.  I looked many different cars before buying the Caddy, the E-class Mercedes was a Benz but that was about it, it was a 145hp 4 banger and 6 cylinder was maybe a 190hp. Not nearly the technology and gadgets that the Caddy has, same with the BMW 5 Series, although more power than the Benz, not the comfort and power of the Caddy, the C-5 Corvette had more power (yeah baby) but not nearly the comfort of the Caddy which has almost as much horsepower and 50 times better ride.  Benz and BMW could not even come in the same universe as far as the sound system is concerned.  As they would say on the Soprano's "Fo Gattt, Abouddd It".

Trust me, The Caddy SLS is Great, The STS is even Better!!!  I just didn't want to pay the extra $5K for 25 more HP.  The SLS has a much softer ride than the STS also.  The "L" is for Luxury and the "T" is for Touring.  The SLS still has the handling and manuverability that the average NASCAR wanna be needs to get the job done.  If you want the extra 25HP from the STS which is quite noticable you can pay the extra $$$ if you got it or you can add performance chips, K&N Air Filters or exhaust systems and get more HP from you SLS for a lot less cash.

Recent Update!!!
Traded my SLS for a 1999 STS.  Everything you read about is true, but for the STS... OH MY GOD!!!  WHOOOOOOOOOOA BABY.  I was torn between the C5 Corvette and the STS, the STS won out and boy am I glad.  Smooth, quiet, strong and powerful.  Not that much of a loss in horsepower and all the style and grace of a Cadillac.  Can't miss with the STS baby.
