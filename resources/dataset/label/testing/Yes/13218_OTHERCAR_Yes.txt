            <b>UPDATE</b> My grand voyager minivan had to go.  After regular oil changes and other routine maintenance, the engine could not continue to operate without using oil  Now, I managed to get a decent trade on it, but I really expected it to last longer.  I think a 4 cylinder engine is simply too small for the size body of this vehicle that it is a poor choice for longevity of the vehicle.  

  The <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager</b> was a reliable family car and performed well for our family.  But it did not last 
as long as I would expect for a car that size and price.

I would purchase another Chrysler product--in fact I did.  A <b>Jeep Wrangler Sport 2000</b>.  I haven't had it long enough to do a review, but look for one soon.


The specks for the one I own are.  65,000 mi.  It has a 4 cyl. engine.  Air conditioning with temp controls for driver and passenger and the back area, anti-lock brakes, power steering, front wheel drive and the rear seats are completely removable.  It holds 7 passengers comfortably.  The storage space behind the rear seat holds a fair amount of luggage, but watch the space for long camping trips.  It can get tight.

I like this van because it is reliable even in camping areas where it probably should not have been the vehicle used.  It did not get us stuck in the mud.  This impressed me most about this mini-van.  I have never really been convinced that mini-vans were the equivalent of SUV's or even trucks for that matter.  And I really like trucks.

This mini-van has two sliding side doors which is great for our family and friends.  It is also great for my husband when loading and unloading his musical equipment.  He never knows which way he can park at gigs, so having a door on both sides is a real blessing to him.

The back opens also,  the back hatch is huge, so watch your head.  I've whacked my head a couple of times closing it. (think I'd have learned the first time). There are also hooks on the back seat for the plastic grocery bags to hang on so they don't swish all over the floor and loose their contents.

<b>What I do not like about this vehicle is...</b>the engine is only 4 cylinders.  Yes, it gets great gas mileage,(32 mpg most of the time) but in Tennessee where we live, it's up and down, around and around hills and curves like crazy.  This minivan is constantly having to shift up and down.  I think it's driving conditions are hard on the transmission.  We could have got a 6 cylinder engine, but the cost at the time was a factor, now I wish we had decided on the 6.

I also do not like the way it handles on our curvy roads.  Maybe it is because I am used to driving a smaller compact car that is closer to the ground. But I used to have a truck on these same roads.  The mini-van handles like a great big tank.  I always feel like it's going to tip--even though it is a lower profile vehicle than say a Ford or Chevy minivan.

It has forced me to slow down, and that is a good thing, I suppose.  I've never had it in a skid even in the snow and ice we've had recently. 

All in all this has been a great family van.  It is reliable, comfortable on long road trips, a great camping van (surprise), and generally easy on the gasoline.

My only dissappointment with the <b>Plymouth Grand Voyager</b> is the engine size really is too small for the driving conditions and the size of the van for this area.  It began the oil use way too soon in the engine's life.  Nowadays, I expect generally an engine to last past 111,000.
