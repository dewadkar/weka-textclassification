            I purchased a 1999 Jetta Wolfsburg as my first car and have been extremely satisfied.  Although the new body-style (1999 1/2 and after) Jettas seem to be an improvement on the older ones, I'd recommend this car to anyone in the market for a fun, economical, reliable car.  I would think one could find a good price on a used older-style model due to the popularity of the newer version.  Here are some of the pros and cons I've found with the Jetta:

PROS:

GREAT HANDLING &amp; FUN TO DRIVE.  Germans in general and VW in particular are renowned for making great handling cars.  I found that to be the case with my Jetta.  I enjoyed the crisp handling and pinpoint-accurate steering.  I have never had so much fun throwing a car around curves, with the exception of driving my friend's BMW.  The car handles so well I found myself feeling a little too much like a race car driver (con?).

OUTSTANDING VALUE.  The Wolfsburg special edition in particular is a great package.  For 1999 it comes with power everything, moonroof, cruise control, 6-disc changer, leather steering wheel and shift knob, silver gauge faces, sport seats (very comfy), sport-tuned suspension (see above on handling), alloy wheels, spoiler, and fog lights.  All this for $16,500 (new).

HIGH QUALITY FIT &amp; FINISH.  The Jetta feels solidly constructed and safe.  Everything in the Jetta seems made from high quality components, down to the texture on the window buttons, green-lit gauges and the thick steering wheel.

NICE STYLING.  VW styling is not for everybody, but I've always loved it.

HUGE TRUNK.  The Jetta looks (and is) small, but when you look in the trunk you'll think it's a miracle of physics.  I've fit a 155cm snowboard in the trunk without having to even put the seats down.  Try that in a Civic.

CONS:

WEAK BASE ENGINE.  The base VW engine is the 115hp four.  It does the job, but can be taxed, especially with a full load of people and stuff in the car.  I recommend the manual to fully utilize the engine.  If you like the Jetta but want the engine to do justice to the car's steering and handling capabilities, the VR6 engine is a (expensive) jewel, making this into a legitimate sports sedan in which you will definitely get speeding tickets.

CRAMPED BACK SEAT.  The back seat can fit two adults for moderate trips, but they will be short on legroom.  Claims of fitting 3 adults in the back for long road trips are cruel hoaxes.

SOME QUIRKY ERGONOMICS.  VWs tend to have some odd features that take some getting used to, but are not major issues.  For example, the cup holders only fit soda cans, the power door lock button is on the center console (which always manages to confuse people), the seats can be reclined only by turning a knob, which can be tiresome.  There is no center armrest, which I find annoying on long trips.

All told, my Jetta rocks.  The only features that I want in a car not available on my version of the Jetta are ABS and all-wheel drive.  Nevertheless, I have a blast with it without ruining my finances.  If they want drivers, they got one.<br><br>
