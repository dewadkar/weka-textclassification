            Our 1996 Dodge Neon, bought new, now with 55,000 miles, has been a great value.  Economical to buy, economical to operate (44 mpg highway, 32-34 mpg city), reliable.  We bought our Neon because the selling price ($9100) was low.  It has never failed us.  It always starts right up, even in sub-zero weather.  It is easy to maintain (I do my own oil changes.).  It handles reasonably well at all speeds.  Only a couple of things that I don't like:  The '96 does not have full frame doors, and one door has developed a rattle.  The left windshield wiper is larger than the right windshield wiper, so that replacing them requires a purchase of two different sized refills.  These are minor problems.  I would definitely buy another Neon and recommend the Neon to anybody seeking excellent value.<br><br>
