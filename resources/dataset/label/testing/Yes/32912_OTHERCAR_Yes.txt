            I reluctantly inherited my sister's 1991 Isuzu Rodeo in 1994 when I totaled my Saab.  She was getting married and didn't need it any more.  I never though I'd like the car.  But now, 6 years later, I wouldn't sell it for the world.  I have been from the East Coast to Florida and back 3 times, Dallas and back once, Colorado and back once, and then to the West Coast permanently.  The only repair I have needed to do over this time was replacing the muffler twice (8 years of New England weather to blame) and replacing the clutch (San Francisco hills and my 5-speed driving ability to blame).  It now has roughly 90,000 miles on it and still drives like a car; it accelerates well and handles turns tightly and gets 350 highway miles on a 15 gallon tank.  Seats are comfy.  Lot's of room in back.  Stereo's good.  A secret compartment under the center console for special stuff.  Everything works fine.

If I had one main complaint it is that the spare tire is on the interior and takes up a good amount of the trunk.  If I have a large load, the back seat comes down easily to expand the trunk.  This solution is pretty simple.  Also, the paint job is fading on the hood and roof, but I think that's because of snow being left on it for long periods of time.  Also, the guy is right - there are no cupholders - but I find a Snapple or a McDonald's coke fits just snuggly between the seat and the center console with no spill.

In summary, I love this car.  I would recommend it, or any Isuzu, to a family member, good friend, or any potential car buyer.  It has lasted and endured more miles than I would have ever expected.  

God bless Rusty Butt, my Rodeo.
