            Two years ago I bought a used 1995 Acura Integra 4 door LS special edition. I have to admit that the car is very slow compared to the GS-R model (and i would recommend all buyers to buy the GS-R model rather than the LS).  However, the car in itself was very enjoyable and comfortable to ride.  If you are looking for a car around the Acura Integra's price...you should buy the Acura Integra.  It is not only stylish but also very affordable.  I would also recommend buyers to buy the stick shift rather than automatic, because the difference in performance is much greater.<br><br>
