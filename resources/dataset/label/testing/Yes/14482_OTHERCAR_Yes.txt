            Bought this car a couple of months ago with a lot of miles on it (151,000 miles). We had a new 1992 LeBaron Convertible and liked it a lot. So, when we saw this one, we stopped to look...ended up buying it. Because of the high miles and a dent in the driver side door, we paid just $1,700.00 for it. Even with all the miles on it, the cloth interior looks great! Has power everything (all works although R/R window gets off track frequently) and ice cold A/C. Has good power for a V-6 and rides okay. Lots of road noise and a fuel pump that's just as noisy. The fuel pump thing seems to be common in mid 1990s Chrysler products. We get good fuel mileage (31/26 MPG). The stereo sucks like a Hoover, though. A new AM/FM/CD is going in at the end of the month.

For $1,700.00, I have nothing to complain about. If you're paying under two grand for a stylish convertible with a decent running V-6, full power and new tires, you ain't got nothing to gripe about...no matter what!

The '92 we bought new was a base model with A/C and we really liked it. This GTC with all the power is great!

Only one gripe: COULDN'T THEY HAVE PUT A COUPLE OF CUP HOLDERS SOMEWHERE? THIS IS A 1994 MODEL...NOT A 1964 MODEL!!!!!!
