            I already have the Fine Pix A101 ,a good friend of mine was quite impressed with this "little camera" , and after inspecting it he told me he definitely wanted to have a Fuji camera , but then a Fuji with more power.
 
So,  after some investigation we arrived at the Fine Pix 3800 with it's powerful features for a moderate price. 

I soundly recommended that He buy this camera. 

After my friend had bought his Fine Pix 3800, he called me over to help him get started with his new camera since I had somewhat experience with a Fuji. 
My good friend in being very satisfied with his new camera went right to work on photographing, and filming clips with the new 3800 and the results were stunning. 

It was at the point of actually experiencing him getting so much enjoyment from using this camera that I sold myself into buying the model for myself. 

Granted my A101 is still the indoor compact camera by choice, but for the greater detail in action photography at 3.2 mega pixels, I always take the Fine Pix 3800. 
Actually I always take both of these cameras wherever I go. 

The 6X zoom is the good feature that compares with more expensive cameras. There is an adapter included for a Taylor lens, a universal serial bus cable for attaching the camera to your home PC, and of course software. 

I really like it's built in multi media features for making editable movie clips with sound, so it also acts like a mini video camera for high frame quality motion pictures that go as long as your XD memory card holds out (I recommend 128 mb's for this job). 

What is nicest is the ease of use, the menu is similar to that of my A201 with only a few slight differences, but this is even easy to explain to my wife, who is no means a techno wiz with electronics. 
With it's flip out flash , one touch focus are great and ease of use , it's a camera that easily comes out to do the job of making professional quality photos , and small home videos. 

Of course as with all Fuji Fine Pix products it has the power saving feature by shutting down the LCD screen when it is not necessary to use, and the electronic viewfinder which more than replaces the LCD just does the rest with very good battery savings. 

If you already have another Fuji digital camera, or even if you want that first Fuji digital Camera this by all means the correct Fuji to get.
