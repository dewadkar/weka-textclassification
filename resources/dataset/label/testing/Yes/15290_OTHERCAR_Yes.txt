            I use this Camera for web page stuff and documentation and use the pictures to E-Mail news Items to co-workers
It is nice to have color disk and use them for different subjects then switch disk with Pictures on they will switch out swiftly a great selling point that only Sony cameras do. I has several types of pictures not that you will ever use them all and will take the pictures in several sizes although the biggest in fine mode will only take one picture for disk.
but at fine and normal size you get close to 20 picks a disk and in low quality small you get 36 to 40 per disk not that you would want many pictures like this.
Overall I really like the camera better than any I have owned I have had 6 this is my 3rd Sony
what ever you get, get Sony at the level you can see fit price wise.
one thing about this one over the other Sony's are this one seems to take longer to save the picture so to snap the next picture may take 15 to 20 seconds<br><br>
