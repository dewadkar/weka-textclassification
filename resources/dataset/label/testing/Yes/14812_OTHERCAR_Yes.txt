            The Pontiac Firebird Trans Am is certainly an atypical vehicle. In certain respects it's a throwback to the muscle car era of the 60's. With 305 Horsepower and the drive wheels being in the rear it performs like the Hot Rod that your Dad probably drove in High School.
 That being said, it is not a car for everyone. Off the line acceleration is excellent and good looks are aplenty on this ride! However, when the road is ice or snow covered - Beware! Even with the optional traction control(approximately $500 option) the limitations of the rear wheel drive format become apparent. With it notorious light rear end you tend to fish tail and spin your wheels in bad weather. Extremely rough roads can also to make the driving experience a bit less enjoyable.
 Other negatives (depending on your domestic situation) are the rear seats and tiny cargo hatchback area. Don't expect to haul anything or comfortably have adult friends sit in the back. This car was simply not designed for those purposes. 
What it was designed for is Performance. The car launches like a rocket from a traffic light. On the highway, the power seems almost never ending (Don't worry about passing)The brakes instill confidence allowing you to stop on a dime. Handling is also quite good although not up to par with the likes of nimble imports such the Toyota Celica or Mitsubishi Eclipse (Both of which I have driven). The leather seats (standard on Trans Am model) are of good quality. The instrument panel, which glows red at night,is pleasing to look at as well as functional. The T-Tops are a very nice feature (also standard on T/A)for the warm weather. I have heard that they tend to leak when they age. I have not had any trouble in my 2 years of ownership. 
The dash is pretty large as is the windshield. They take a bit of getting used to. Under the passengers floor area you will find a bulge. It's the catalitic converter protruding from underneath. Not exactly the best design. Although I think the engineers had little choice in where to stuff the thing. 
The &quot;Monsoon/Pontiac&quot; CD player is slightly better than average. It provides nice bass and decent mid-range. For audiophiles-it can leave a bit to be desired. Factory installed systems simply don't match up to after-market ones. For the most part, I think 75% of drivers would be quite happy with the sound. The steering wheel mounted radio controls are great--All cars should have them. 
One look under the hood and you can tell that the monster engine was literally stuffed under the hood. I personally leave maintenance to the professionals. I would'nt feel comfortable attempting to work on this vehicle. It looks far to complex. 
If you have the dough, there are plenty of companies that produce after-market parts to make this awesome car even more awesome and powerful. I would highly recommend this vehicle to someone who wants to be exhilarated behind the wheel. In my opinion it gives one heck of a bang for the buck. (Auto insurance is sky high for young drivers though.) You'll be hard pressed to match the look or performance of this vehicle. Get yours soon...Word has it that the vehicle may not be built for much longer!!!!        <br><br>
