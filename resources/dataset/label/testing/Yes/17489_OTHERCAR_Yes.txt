            My wife and I had been researching mini-vans for the past year and a half, so that we would be prepared when we were ready to make a purchase.

We liked several of them, including the Honda, Grand Caravan, and the Town and Country, among others.

But when we finally looked at the Sedona, we knew right away that this was the one for us.

The price was obviously the first component to reel us in for a closer look.  Then it was the fact that many of the included features were options on all of the other mini-vans.  (We bypassed the LX and looked at the EX right away, because it was so inexpensive).

We realized that with adding the few available options the Sedona offered, the van was loaded.  (Having few available options is not a slight on the Sedona - it just shows how much is actually included).

With two young children (2 1/2 years and 9 mos.), we wanted the leather interior because it would be easier to keep clean.  

What we found when looking at colors and vehicle options was - the Sedonas are built with different combinations of options, then shipped out.  Basically, we couldn't "build" a Sedona with our preferences, we had to find one that was closest to them.  But this was OK, because other than the leather package and the ABS (which we had wanted), the other options didn't cost that much.

We shopped around at two dealerships, and both had told us that they were having trouble getting them in because the demand was so high.

We found the one we were looking for at the 2nd dealership, and settled on a price.  (We won!).

Another selling point for us had to do with the local dealership.  Their service department has a good reputation, and we were assured that if we did have a problem with the Sedona, they would take care of us.  We'll see.

We've had it for a couple of days, and love it.  My problem is, I can never drive it, because my wife always has it out.

As far as the gas mileage is concerned, I feel it is a trade-off.  The Sedona is made of heavier steel in the frame, which costs less (from what I'm told), and could result in why it is less expensive than other minis.  My thinking is a heavier steel frame equals a stronger steel frame, which means a safer, though heavier, vehicle.  And since I don't plan on lifting it anytime soon, I'll take the added safety factor for my family any day.

All in all, we feel we ripped somebody off, and feel guilty for driving this vehicle after paying so little for it.
