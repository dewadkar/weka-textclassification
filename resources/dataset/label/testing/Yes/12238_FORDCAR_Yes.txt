            Christmas 1994. My younger brother presented me with a toy truck and on the bottom was taped a key. He directed me outside and there, parked in front of the door, was a New 1994 Ford Ranger. What a guy! And what a truck.

It's a very sporty looking vehicle with chrome wheels. Mine has the 4-cylinder engine and if you are to do any heavy hauling or travel up many steep inclines or even need to accelerate into traffic faster, then you would be happier with a 6 cylinder. It is a small truck with a 6 ft bed. In my younger days I had a similar size truck that held 6 half kegs of beer and a 90 pound pig, so this <i>could</i> do the same. I emphasize the word &quot;could&quot; as my wife has put the brakes on such activities.

As a homeowner, a truck can be invaluable. I've used it for dump runs, mulch, carrying my lawnmower, to the gravel pit and to my favorite place.....Home Depot.

Maintenance wise I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles, had a front end alignment, had the fan belt changed and some new tires. The shield covering the catalytic converter broke a few welds and was rattling and had to be removed. It has been a very reliable vehicle. 

The ride is rough as with all trucks and there isn't much room if you have a family. My wife doesn't like to ride in it and can't drive a stick(it's a 5 -speed). Young children shouldn't ride in it for the lack of a back seat. During the winter, I have to put weight (I use sand bags) in the back for traction in the snow. 

If you are single it's great and for a family it's hard to beat as a 2nd vehicle. I would buy another but this one holds so much sentimental value that I may keep it forever. I hope to teach my young daughter to drive it someday...

And with the luck I have had with this fine truck....I may be able to.
