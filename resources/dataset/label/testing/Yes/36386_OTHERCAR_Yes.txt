            I bought this truck new and it was the first "new" vehicle I've purchased.  I work as a consultant in Washington and Idaho and most of the driving I do is long haul-high speed driving.  I was looking for a comfortable, easy to drive truck that will haul my family, do-it yourself projects from Home-Depot and tow my toys.  This truck has exceeded my expectations for those tasks.

Power: I have the 4.7L engine with a manual 5 speed transmission.  I agree with the previous reviewers in that this package has performed impressively.  I tow a 3500lb boat and 4 people at 70 miles/hr in 4th gear very comfortably without sway, significant power loss, or overheating.  I pass with ease and have plenty of "get up" when I have to get around someone on a grade.  The 14-17MPG is a bummer, but some of my friends with older pickups are getting 10MPG, which puts things in perspective.

Handling: The cornering radius of this long wheel base truck is very tight and it gets around in parking lots with ease.  The steering is tight and intuitive, and the braking is steady and firm.  The shifting is easy and not sticky.  It handles corners predictably, with confidence and without a lot of sway.  My wife likes to drive this truck, which is pretty good considering she didn't care for any of the other trucks we tested (Chevy and Ford).  

Ride: The truck purrs at 70 and is very quiet for a pickup.  We have gone on several 6-8 hour road trips with 4 people and gear and everyone comments on how comfortable and roomy it is.  It IS a mid-sized truck, however, so is not as smooth as a car.  I notice this especially on bumpy roads around town.

Amenities:  I have the SLT Plus package with power everything, keyless entry, and AC.  I am impressed with the amount of lighting in the cab, which is really helpful when you're looking for something under the seat in a dark parking lot.  There is only one cupholder for the passengers in front on the driver's side, however, which I thought was odd.  The fold-down console is big and wide, which is great for me because I do a lot of note-taking when I'm on the road (parked, of course).  The cruise control is a God-Send; I couldn't live without it and everything is on the steering wheel where you're hands are.   The bed-light is nice and bright and has been helpful on occasion.  4X4 on the fly is very cool; you flick a switch and you're locked in.  This has been very helpful for the winter driving and has worked beautifully for me.

Reliability: I have some grave concerns here.  At about 37.000 miles I started noticing a creaking sound when pulling into parking lots and the heater core blew up on a roadtrip and began leaking into the cab.  I had purchased the extended warranty, which covered the repairs thru the dealer (the creaking was due to worn strut rod bushings).  At 55,000 miles (6 months later) The brand new heater core blew up again, and I had begun to notice a vibration at 65-70 miles/hr.  The ring and pinion had worn out and the drive-shaft needed to be replaced (the U-joints are integral and part of the whole unit).  These repairs were also covered by the extended warranty.  Since I use my car for work the company helps pay for maintenance, so I have been extra diligent about keeping everything lubricated, etc.  The heater core problem has baffled the mechanics, and the rear-end rebuild at 50,000 miles has me worried if this is a sign of things to come.  I was unsure of the wisdom of the extended warranty at the time of purchase but it has more than covered me for these repairs and car loaner, making it seem like wise money at this point.

Overall:  I love this truck.  I love the way it looks, drives, hauls gear, hauls a__, and tows my toys.  I'm worried about the reliability, however, as I've never had to have a rear-end rebuilt at 50,000 miles; 100,000 miles, maybe, but not this soon.
