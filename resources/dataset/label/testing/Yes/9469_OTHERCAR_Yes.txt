My brother has gone threw a Starter and currently is sittign in the driveay right now due to a problem with the oil pressure that started as of today 12/22/99 as for mine i havnet had any major problems other then it stalled many times on me a few months ago but were never abel to determin the problem and right now it seems that the transmission is slipping.  Even though i am very loyal to the dodge i love the truck and wish i didnt havethese problems cause in 1 year when i go to buy a new im sorry to say i willmost likely buy ford cause of the reputation i have gotten from friedns about them.  Thank you for your time spent readitg this i hope it has helped you with your decision<br><br>
