            The Olympus D-600L is a wonderful digital camera.  It is easy to use and produces high quality pictures.  The instructions are very informative and most anyone would understand how to use it. There are many features to this camera that are also helpful.  Like most other digital cameras it allows you to view your picture right after taking it so you can decide if you want to save it or delete it.  This allows you to save space and keep only pictures you think are the best.<br>This camera allows you to zoom in and get a clear picture of something no matter how close or far away it is.  It also has a flash for night shots.  This camera has a timer so everyone can get in on the picture. When taking pictures, you can have the choice of either super high quality, high quality, or standard quality. Each showing a better picture, for what you need. <br><br>The only cons about this product is that there isn't a built in disk to save your pictures on. You have to buy one, and if you want it to go in your computer on a floppy disk you also have to buy that. It is still very easy to download the pictures onto your computer right from the camera.<br><br>This camera is the choice if you are looking for something that takes good pictures, is easy to use, and doesn't cost a whole lot of money.<br><br><br>
