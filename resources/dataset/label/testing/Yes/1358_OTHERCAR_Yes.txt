            I received the Eagle Talon as a gift after my grandfather passed away. He had used it as his stud mobile. If you can picture a 78-year-old man with a ponytail picking up hot babes.

The car has 125,000 miles on it and runs like charm. So far I have had no problems with it. I just had it inspected with our state inspection center. We have to pass emissions etc. The car passed with flying colors. 

This car is the regular model and does not have turbo. Although at times I wonder when I am flying down the highway and don't realize how fast I am driving,

The Eagle Talon is a great car it is roomy and economical to drive. You can fit four people comfortably. The car gets good gas mileage. I drive 50 miles a day for work and just get in the car and go.

The shifter in the car is neat it is set up high. This makes it very easy to shift. The Talon has a nice stereo system and I love listening to it. This car is equipped with a cassette deck. Some I have seen have CD players I wish this one did. 

The dashboard has lots of bells and whistles to tell you if you are low on gas. The speedometer also has a trip meter. This car also has A/C, which I love in the summer. It keeps me nice and cool.

The car offers a smooth ride. I have also found out that it handles well in the snow. This winter has been brutal in the east. So far I have had no problem Nellie gets up and go in the snow. She also warms up nice on cold mornings.

The only downfall I have with the car is that it is a typical sports car and is very low to the ground. Getting in and out at times can be tough on the back. If you have a bad back I don't recommend this car.  Also the car has automatic seatbelts. These absolutely drive me insane. Half the time I just about decapitate myself trying to get out of the car.
