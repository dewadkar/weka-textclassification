            I recently bought my daughter a used Mazda Protege.  Our family has always trusted Mazdas, having owned 3 626's and a pick-up.  Just as an insight into the quality of the Mazda brand, I owned a 1988 626 that I sold to my sister in 1993 with 80,000 miles on it.  Her son is driving it now with over 180,000 miles on it and still running perfectly.

When my ex-husband and I decided to buy our teenage daughter a car, we knew that we couldn't get her something very &quot;pricey.&quot;  So, we began reading classifieds and searching used car lots.  We compared Honda Accords, Honda Civics, Nissan Sentras, Ford Escorts, Mazda Protege, and several other compact, economy cars.  We wanted to buy her something that we felt would last for at least a few years, but we didn't want to spend too much on it.  All of the prices were in the same range.  Considering that the price was pretty much the same, I decided to search hardest for a Mazda--a brand that I already trusted.

We finally found one for her.  A 1995 Protege LX.  She fell in love with it when she saw it.  It is a very cute &quot;teen car.&quot;  Not only did she fall in love with it, I did also--with the price--only 7000 dollars.  We inspected the car thoroughly and gave it a long test drive.  The car was in great shape--a couple scratches, but a perfect interior and very clean.  We bought it.

This was over a month over.  She still loves her car.  She shows it off to everyone.  She has never even thought of it as &quot;an old, used&quot; car.  We have had no trouble out of it, and we expect our ride to continue to be smooth for the life of the vehicle.<br><br>
