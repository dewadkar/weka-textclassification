            I bought an Accent GL (4-door)with A/C, security lock and don't regret it a bit. Not only is it not expensive you get more for your buck then if you bought a car that costs $5000 more. The warranty can't be beat, 10 year on the the powertrain and 5 year front to back with free towing etc (like that will even be needed). I get great reception from my radio (1 person I saw complained about that) and it purrs like a kitten (engine noise is very low). Also the ride is smooth and heat and A/C work great. Room is not a problem so I don't know how that 1 person called it a clown car, he either was driving an outdated Accent or is just biased for some unkown reason. For anyone that can't afford a car over $25,000 I highly recommend this one!<br><br>
