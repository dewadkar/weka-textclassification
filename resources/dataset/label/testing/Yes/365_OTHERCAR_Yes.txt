            Well if there isn't another SUV out there for you to consider, the choices these days are so hard.  There are Jeeps, Fords, everything you could think of.   Well now there is one that you can trust and be made the number one choice of the new millenium.   The new Nissan Xterra is Detriot Auto Shows SUV of the year, it won!   It has a ski rack, first aid kit and more.   Its handling is great.  It doesn't have role on the turns.   It feels like you are driving a car.   You can't get a better choice than the Nissan Xterra.   I can't belive that someone would even think this new car is even a choice to be a bad choice.   I like big butts and I can not lie!!!  So when you see this car on the road just honk the horn and show that driver that like that car!<br><br>
