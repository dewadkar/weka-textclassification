            WHAT A GREAT CAR!!!! &quot;The Base prices for the BMW 5 Series have not changed from the previous year, in fact BMW has added a few standard features to each of the models to improve their overall value. The Dynamic Stability Control System is now a standard feature on the 528i models. Metallic paint is now a no charge option on the 528i as well. The 540i now comes with standard Xenon headlights and Rain Sensor Wipers. All 5 Series models have available sport packages which come with sport suspension, performance tires, upgraded wheels and the M-Sport steering wheel. Another option on the BMW 5 Series is the GPS Navigation System, which includes an Onboard Computer, Emergency Call System, Geographic Disc and Automatic Ventilation System.&quot;
