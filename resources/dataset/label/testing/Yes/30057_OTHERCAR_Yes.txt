            The true test of technological devices in today's world is time...and the Kodak DC-260 has truly proved it's worth. I got this camera in August of 1998, and it's still just a notch below the rest...sort of... :)

It's a great camera with excellent features such as the 3x optical zoom - 2x digital, exposure control, USB and serial transfer. From my own use, I have never found the camera to be overly draining on the battery--during most sessions, I take an average of about 20-30 pictures and have NiMH batteries that last for 3 to 4 sessions without recharge.

There are also lens adapters that allow for extreme closeups. I haven't had a chance to get a set yet, but I am saving up for them. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do this, but here's the link to see pics of the close ups: http://home.earthlink.net/~crowboy/frames.html.

It's pretty amazing! I firmly believe that Kodak makes excellent cameras...that's not to say that other companies are very good as well, for example the new Nikon's look really good too!

By the way, the image quality on this camer is amazing. It's colors are true and the detail is sharp. However, I have noticed that if you are not focused directly on the portion of the image you want, it's not quite as &quot;focus friendly&quot;, I guess? Let's just say it get slightly fuzzy around the center of focus, but just _slightly_...very slight...Also, it does take a while between shots if you battery is dying, but I think that's true with any camera, even non-digital.

But I'm almost positive that no matter what model Kodak you choose, you will be satisfied.
