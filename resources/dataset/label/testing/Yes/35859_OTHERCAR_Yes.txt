            I love my Lumina.  When I was pregnant I had a 97 Firebird (yes I miss it).  When I had my daughter I realized something.  Sports cars do not have big back seats.  It was very hard to fit her carseat in the back seat.
  As much as I hated to, I sold my firebird and bought a used Chevy Lumina.  It has proved to be a good investment.  (I did not want to buy a new car again until she was out of a car seat.)  
 My Lumina is a black 4 door sedan. It is much easier to get people in and out.  There is plenty of leg room in the back seat, and the trunk is huge.  We went on vacation this summer and I drove my car. The ride was perfect.  The seats are very comfortable.  
 I think the Chevy Lumina looks very sporty (for a 4 door).  I get comfort and room and i did not have to buy a mini van. I think this car is perfect for families, especially families with children who have to use a carseat.
 My only complaint about this car is the color.  Black is very hard to keep clean, and it is hot in the summer.  I plan on getting mine painted before summer so then I will have no complaints.
