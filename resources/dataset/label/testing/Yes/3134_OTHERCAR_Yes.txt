            After driving my 1997 Elantra for 3 years (and 50,000 miles), I felt it was time for me to get a bigger car. I also wanted one with more &quot;bells and whistles&quot;. So I went to the Hyundai dealer to trade up for a Sonota, but fell in love with the 2000 Elantra Wagon.

This is definitely bigger than my old Elantra. It has more head room, wider and more comfortable seats, much more storage space and the new design is great. It is also more powerful than my previous Elantra, with a 2.0 DOHC engine.

The additional features that come standard on all the GLS Wagon (the GLS is the only model of Elantra available) are very impressive: power windows and door locks, cassette, air conditioning, tilt wheel and roof rails. I also got mine with cruise control and remote keyless entry. Considering that all my previous Elantra came standard with was seats and an engine, this is a big step up for me.

The only &quot;complaint&quot; I have about the Elantra Wagon so far is that I could not get beige interior with any body color other than black and green. Thankfully, the black one (the one I chose) looks amazing.

I love the way the wagon drives, and I feel very safe in it. I have had no problems at all in the two months that I have owned it. Also, considering that it costs about $5,000 less than the Sonota, it is a terrific value. If you really want to be impressed, check out the 5 year/60,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that is also standard.<br><br>
