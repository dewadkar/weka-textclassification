            I am the owner of a 1998 Ford Escort Sports model and I am very surprised.  In the past I had own a Taurus and had to spend so much in repairs that I developed a hatred for FOrd and all other American Model cars.  A friend of mine that happened to work at a Ford dealer convinced me to come by his showroom while car shopping and I went with the idea of passifing a friend and then getting out of there.  He showed me the Ford Escort Sport Model, and I was pretty impressed.  They had redesigned the outside look giving it a more modern and sporty appearence.  When I sat inside I was furter impressed (not only by that new car smell) but the the spacicious interior and comfortable seats.  The dash has a very nice and easy layout with all controls within easy reach of the driver.  I then figured...well I'm here...lets take it for a ride.  The pickup was nice and the  ar handeled very well.  The cornering was good (even  when making those sharp turns) and the over feel of the car was excellent.  

Next came the big question....maintenance...would this be the money pit that I had in the Taurus?  The dealer...my friend...the shark assured me that the maintenance and upkeep was excellent.  If this guy wasn't a friend of mine I would have been out of there right then for lying to me....but 1 and 1/2 years later the car has only needed the occasional oil change and no additional work due to mechanical failure or breakdown. <br><br>
