            Driveline 

Our engine is the 4.0L plenty of power runs really smooth. It has 195 horses and 230 torque.  The transmission is 4-speed automatic.  Transmission shifts with prompt smoothness. Great get up and go! No problem passing any vehicles on the highway. You cannot hear any of the outside environment noises from inside the cabin during highway driving. Gas mileage could use some improvement, but not too bad considering it is an SUV. It gets 16 mpg / 21 mpg. 

Suspension 

Braking is strong and smooth. After around 15,000 miles you need the get the rotors turned due to warpage. You can feel the steering wheel shake during braking. The steering is nice and tight, turns well. Quit maneuverable for an SUV. 

Cargo 

The cargo has improved since they decided to relocate the spare tire from the cargo hold to beneath the rear floor. Cargo storage in cu. ft. is 72.3.  The rear seats folds completely flat to give you about twice as much cargo area. The seats fold down with ease, just lift the bottom seat and fold the back of the seat down until its flush. 

Interior 

Four adults get plenty of space. The driver and front passenger seats have heat, really nice during the cold months. Getting in and out of the Jeep is easy; it&#146s not too high where you need a handle to get in. The driver&#146s side seat slides back when ever you pull the key out of the ignition for ease of egress. There are radio/CD controls on the back of the steering wheel. You can change the volume, seek, and flip from the radio to the CD player without taking your hands off the wheel. That&#146s a nice safety feature. The driver&#146s side rear view mirror and the rear view mirror have the auto dim feature. When a bright light hits the mirror, it automatically dims it for you. The AC/Heating controls have an auto feature too. It has a sensor that picks up the driver and front passenger body heat and adjusts it accordingly. The keyless entry has a his and hers memory. My key chain is black and my wife&#146s is a light gray. Whenever I unlock the Jeep, the seat, mirrors and radio stations go to my preset. Like wise for my wife. The stereo is really nice. Loud and clear, the 10 disc CD player never skips. It has an on board computer that tells you the outside temperature, compass, how much fuel you have until empty, how many miles until you need service and you can change some of the bells and whistles features like do you want the horn to beep when you lock the Jeep. I am very pleased with this vehicle!!

We have over 25,000 miles on the Jeep with ZERO rattles, squeaks, clicking or anything that sounds like that!

The only negative thing about this vehicle is that about every 15,000 miles you have to get the front brake rotors turned due to steering wheel pulsating during braking.
