I bought an Acura Integra a few years ago and have overall been quite happy with it. The car is well made, on the sporty side and was a great value. If you are looking for a fairly practical, yet sport car, this is a great car for you.

For all of its positives, I find it difficult to get really excited about this car. The low end torque isn't impressive, and the handling is like that of a Honda - smooth and steady, but far from &quot;sporty&quot;. I hear the GSR version addresses most of these &quot;sports car&quot; issues (I have the LS).

Overall a great car. You'll be able to drive it for a ton of years.<p>
