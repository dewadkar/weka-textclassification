            Dear Readers...
I Just purchased two Audi S4 Quattro's.  One is for pro racing in the Speedvision &quot;World Challenge&quot; series and the second for everyday use. I have driven or owned just about all German, British, and Italian cars.  In fact I just sold a 98' Mercedes C43 to get the Audi. This car is simple amazing! Especially for the price of around $40K. The ride is a nice balance beteen stiff and smooth. The fit and finish is perfect and the seats and controls are easy to get used to.  It's all business with very little &quot;Gucci&quot; stuff. The turbos make me smile every time I am at full throttle. The gearing is perfect in that you can pull in all gears even if you are not in the power band.  It is easy to just want to wind it out but the best shifting takes place at 6000RPM. The only weak point on the car seems to be the brakes.  I don't know who told all the car companies their customers wanted spongy, soft brakes but I think on a car of this level it is not very confident. You can't tell where you are on the pedal even though the car will always stop.  My new 911 has wonderful brakes...do the Germans think us americans are weak in the knees?  Also the position between accelerator and brake make it hard to heel and toe on downshifts.  Other than this the S4 is the best sedan I have owned.
The race car I will be driving is being prepared by TAP in Florida (352-628-2834) the premier tuning guys for Audi's in the states and a wonderful resource for upgrades. This car will be 450hp in race trim...watch out Vipers and Vettes. I purchased my cars from Ed Kress at Don Rosen Imports in Phila. PA and not only had a selection of S4's in stock, but was a pleasure to do business with! <br><br>
