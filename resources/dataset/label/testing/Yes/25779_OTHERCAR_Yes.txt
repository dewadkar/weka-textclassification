            This was not my car.  It was my mother in law's.  She had a 1993 green Altima GXE with gray plush interior.  It had tilt, cruise, automatic, child door locks, automatic windows,mirrors and door locks.  She bought it in 1995.  It had about 20,000 miles on it when she got it. It was just a 4 cylinder engine.  But it had some power!!  

The Nissan place that we purchased it at was very good.  The salesman got 4 sales off of it.  After she bought the Altima, my sister in law got a 1993 Sentra, my ex and I got a 1992 Sentra GXE, and my father in law got a 1992 Nissan 4 wheel drive truck.  We loved the salesman.  He didn't try to FORCE a car onto us.  He let us pick it. There was no "This is the best car on the lot... Can I draw up papers??" gimmick.

She purchased the Altima.  It has been a good car.  The front seats are 2 bucket seats and the back seat is a bench seat with a fold down into the trunk.  She only had one problem with the car.  The air conditioner messed up.  She had to take it to the dealer and they fixed it.  That did not stop her from getting a new Altima.  She has since then traded this Altima in for a 1998 Nissan Altima.  She was so impressed with the first one that she went for another go around with Altima. The Altima has power to just be a 4 cylendar.  It held to the road really well.  Over all this is a good car.

Thank you for reading and have a good night!
