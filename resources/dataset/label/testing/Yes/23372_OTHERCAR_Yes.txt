            The Mercedes M-430 is an excellant sport utility vehicle. It has plenty of power, with a quiet and comfortable interior. The seats are very comfortable. The interior is beautiful. And, the car comes with standard 17 inch alloy wheel wich are very nice. The 430 is noticebly more powerful and quick than the 320, and it rides just slightly better (probably because of the bigger wheels). The 430 has the navigation system standard and a CD-ROM drive in the premium bose radio consol. Having the CD drive in the front consoul can be very conviniant, especially if you change your CDs alot. The bose radio system is very nice with very good quality sound. The 430 comes with an advance 4 wheel drive system that does great off road and really shines in the snow. The 430 drives like a car and was a very good buy, at least so far.<br><br>
