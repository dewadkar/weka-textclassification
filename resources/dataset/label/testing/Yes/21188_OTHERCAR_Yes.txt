            In 1997, after having a turbo sports car for over 7 years, that was loaded with features, I decided it was time to buy a new car.  I took a complete 90 degree turn to say the least.  I purchased a new 1997, 4 cylinder, Geo Metro Sedan 4-door standard.  It was loaded only with the basics this time, this included, excellent A/C, stereo with cassette (not bad), and seats with scotch guard!

How could I have made such a drastic change in car style and performance?  My answer to that had to do with general maintenance costs over the years and not a target for theft.

Why did I choose a Geo?  A lot of people are curious about this, but Geo doesn't have a bad rap, as many assume.  It is not a Yugo!  Anyway, I noticed that Alamo rent-a-car used Geo for its economy car rentals for a few years.  Alamo does a lot a research, so there for, has a reason for choosing the cars they do for their company, mainly endurance and reputation.

I am pleased to say that I have been trouble free mechanically for 4 years now.  I am happy with my choice.  It has duel airbags and great mileage for the buck!

To satisfy my decision further, I was more impressed to hear that Chevrolet took Geo under its own wing in 1998 as the newest addition to their family fleet.  Geo Metro is now called Chevrolet Metro.  Again, there was a reason for this.  Its a good, reliable car for an economy size, and even Chevrolet recognized this as a good business decision.

I will admit, there is one thing I do not like about my Geo Metro.  I can really feel the car moving when it is windy outside, and I have to keep both hands on the wheel at all times.  It is the lightest car I have ever known, concerning weight.

I do not recommend this car for anyone who has owned a larger heavier car for all their driving lives.  You can feel all the bumps, not bad though, but you feel more in this smaller car.
