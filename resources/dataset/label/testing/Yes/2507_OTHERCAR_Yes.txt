            I bought the Cherokee because of its price and reliability.  So far I have had great luck with the vehicle. Listed are the highs and lows:

highs: 
awesome performance out of the inline 6
reliable transmission
easy to modify for off road use
easy to use 4 wheel drive

lows:
brakes - fade to easy
interior - have had to fix a lot of noisy items inside
interior seating position - average for a person over 6' tall like me

Driving the vehicle cannot be any easier. Gas mileage is average, nothing spectacular.

Who should buy this vehicle:  a person who wants a pretty much no nonsense 4x4.

Who should not buy it:  People who need to have a lot of legroom for backseat passengers or who would have a hard time getting in and out of the small entry in the back seat. Tall people who have to drive long distances.<br><br>
