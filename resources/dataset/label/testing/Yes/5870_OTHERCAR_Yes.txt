            My second car was a 1996 Berretta, the first being a spartan Hyundai Excel, which still runs after 150,000+ miles with hardly any problems.  I purchased the car new, and paid roughly $12500 for the upper 1SM.  Which mind you, was less than a lesser Neon.

The 1SM package provides most of the features of the Z26 package without the fancy (tacky) body work, and without power windows.  The 3.1 V6 pulls strongly, although a 5 speed would deliver the power better than the 4 speed automatic -- two features not offered on the more expensive neon.  The power locks are a plus, but the fact they lock when the car is moved from park is soemthing I could live without, although the new Silverado does the same.  The stereo is excellent for an under $15,000 car.  Mine was equipped with the cd player, and four 50 watt speakers.

The seats are decent for middle distance trips, save the back seat.  As with all compact GT cars the back seat suffers, although it is bearable for short trips.  The lack of more adjustment, especially lumbar supports is kind of a turn off.  Head room in small for a six footers, but at least the seats tilt to provide more room.  Tilt steering is another great feature, even more important when sharing the vehicle.  The A/C blows cold thanks to CFC free agents and does an excellent job cooling down the interior on a hot day.

The engine is very good for everyday use, and returns good mileage -- about 25 city and 30 highway with fourth gear overdrive.  Mileage can be better, as I drove the car very aggressively, but the car stayed very stable even at speeds approaching triple digits (not recommended for safety purposes).

Chevy did a pretty good job with this car, but not its sister the Corsica.  compared to what these were going up against in the price category, they really are stars.  How many under $13,000 NEW provide a V6 and 4 speed automatic as options and ABS/Power Locks standard?  Compared to the 4 cylinders, I would suffer with lack of head room and lumbar support for the stronger engine.<br><br>
