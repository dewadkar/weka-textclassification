            I like my little Sephia a lot. I think the handling is not too bad for an inexpensive car. The heat works excellent, but doesn't shoot at the foot area very well.  The Sephia has a very nice body design.  It's very 'sporty'.  I got mine in a very cool color (violet).  I bought my KIA because that dealership was pretty much the only one who would give me a loan without a co-signer.  However, I did have a problem with the front passenger side window.  It took great effort to roll it back up once it was down.  But this was easily remedied and it works fine now.  So, even though I did have a few problems in the beginning, now me and my KIA are doing pretty well.  I'm glad to have her.<br><br>
