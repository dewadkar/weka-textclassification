            Much has been made in recent years about �twin� or �cousin� vehicles; we�ve all seen them. Simply put, twinned vehicles are 2 or more cars or trucks that share the same basic mechanical architecture, but seem to look a little different. This was an all too common practice in the 1980s, so much so that it was hard to tell the difference between a Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac or Oldsmobile � they all looked the same. Some current examples of closely related �twinned� vehicles include: Toyota Camry/Lexus ES300, Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, GMC Yukon/Chevy Tahoe, and the Dodge Grand Caravan/Chrysler Town & Country minivans. In some cases it is painfully obvious which cars are twins, in other cases even an expert would be hard pressed to see the similarities.

In previous decades, twinned vehicles were little more than the same car with a different logo slapped on, today�s twinned vehicles are much more sophisticated in both their differences and similarities. 

The Toyota Highlander is a new kind of twinned vehicle � the contemporary term is �platform sharing.� The term twin implies and identical-ness that is simply not accurate when speaking of most modern cars or trucks (with the notable exception of a few American brands). The Highlander shares its basic platform or chassis with a number of other Toyota products. The Highlander is related (however loosely) to the 2001 Toyota Camry, Sienna minivan, and of course the current Lexus RX300. The RX300 is  proof of just how successful and important platform sharing can be. One of the great advantages to sharing platforms is that an automaker can use a well engineered car platform as a starting point for what will ultimately be a rather �truck-like� vehicle. The Highlander and RX300 are perfect examples of this as they both have a truck or SUV like appearance and usefulness while maintaining many car-like attributes such as ride comfort, smoothness and predictable handling.

Like the RX300, the Toyota Highlander really shines in a few very important areas; namely the previously mentioned ride and handling. Here is one of the few SUVs that can truly brag about offering truck like versatility with car like manners. It isn�t that the Highlander, or even the RX300, is the best SUV on the road, it�s just so difficult to overlook it as a really good all-around car that�s very easy to live with on a daily basis. 

Other than styling, there are a few notable differences between the RX300 and Highlander. The RX�s ride seems to be more tuned for comfort while the Highlander has a bit stiffer feel. This is especially noticeable during moderate to hard cornering. Although both vehicles handle incredibly well, it�s the Highlander that exhibits slightly less body roll through the corners. On the open road, the Highlander�s slightly firmer ride results in feeling more bumps and imperfections in the road. Also, the JBL 6-CD changer that is available on the Highlander sounds better than the Lexus Premium system found in the RX300 (Mark Levinson is not available in the RX300).

One of the main advantages of the Highlander is that it can be configured in many different ways. The Highlander offers the option of an inline-4 or the same 220 hp V6 that powers the RX. Like the RX, the Highlander is available in 2 or 4-wheel drive. If you�re looking to save money, but still need the space and versatility, and reliability of a Toyota SUV, the Highlander is the one for you. A fully loaded Highlander can easily cost just as much as a similarly equipped RX300, so you won�t save any money there. But the fact that the Highlander can be ordered with fewer features and an optional 4-cylinder engine, if the buyer so wishes, means a real savings of a few thousand dollars can be had.  A Highlander Limited 4x4 V6 with leather, sunroof and VSC (stability control) has an MSRP of just over $35,000. Cleary we�re in Lexus territory at $35K plus, but knock off the Limited package, heated seats and 4-wheel drive and the sunroof and you�ll still be treated to Lexus like quality and comfort at somewhat of a bargain price.

Styling is subjective � my personal preference with regard to styling is the Lexus RX300�s more round and slightly feminine look. It�s true, check the streets, a lot of women drive RX300s. That being said many people prefer the Highlander�s more chiseled and rugged styling. The Highlander looks more masculine � more like a guy�s car. Both are good-looking vehicles � those that prefer cars will likely find the RX more appealing while those who consider themselves �truck people� will probably opt for the Highlander and its more square look.

Inside the Highlander Limited is a very luxurious environment. Wood grained trim is plentiful, and in typical Toyota fashion, all knobs and switches are exactly where you expect. The only interior complaint is that the radio volume knob is a similar size, shape and color as the climate control adjustment for temperature. The result is that one often turns the temperature down when the intent was to lower the radio volume and vice versa. 

A high point inside the Highlander is the reclining rear seats. This is a luxury car feature  found on such premium brands as Cadillac; Toyota has seen fit to include it in the Highlander and the less expensive RAV4. Rear seats are incredibly comfortable and offer more than ample legroom, hip room, and headroom. Expect three normal sized adults to ride in comfort. Rear seat space is one area in which the Highlander tops the similar sized 4Runner. Both offer plentiful cargo room, but the Highlander is a better choice if you plan to haul more people than stuff. The Highlander�s 60/40 rear seats fold all the way down with ease. The Highlander does not offer third row seating, it is a 5-passenger vehicle.

As mentioned earlier, the Highlander shares some mechanical components with other Toyota products which may explain why it all works so well. The 3.0L V6 offers more than adequate acceleration, and as with almost every other Toyota engine, it�s smoothness and refinement are exceptional. While the Highlander Limited is a comfortable travel companion, around town (especially in urban settings) is where is does it�s best work. The combination of a roomy interior and somewhat compact exterior dimension, plus  a powerful V6 makes  the Highlander the perfect commute and family errand running car. It�s ability to fit into cramped parking lots and yet comfortably carry 5 adults is note worthy in a place like Los Angeles where everything seems to be crowded all the time and public parking is almost a luxury.

While it seems fair to say the Highlander and Lexus RX300 are very similar in many respects, a Lexus customer will have a dramatically different buying and subsequent service experience. Many Toyota dealerships in Southern California are crowded with salesmen so stereotypical they almost seem like a practical joke � slicked back hair, gold chains (the 80s are over dude), pinky rings, silk ties, and general disposition that has my wife refusing to even get out of the car even when we go just to buy windshield wiper refills (we lease a Toyota Camry � great car by the way). Contrast this to the near museum like setting of most Lexus dealerships, staffed by educated people who don�t once seem to say �what can I do to get you to but this car today.� The courtesy is extended to the service department as well � Toyota customers who spent $30,000 - $45,000 on a well equipped SUV will be treated to the same 4 year old shuttle van as the rest of the �91 Tercel owners. Lexus owners fare much better with a complimentary loan car in many cases as well as a swankier waiting area and expensive coffee. Sure, many Lexus vehicles cost in excess of $50,000 but when cross shopping similarly priced SUVs, it seems worth noting.

Overall the 2002 Highlander is nothing more and nothing less than a practical, well-built, car-based SUV. As with most Toyota products, it is possible to save money by cutting back on the options, but add some common features and the price climbs quickly. While very similar to the Lexus RX300, the Highlander offers some differences � mostly styling, handling and an extra, money saving, engine choice. The good news is that even those who are looking to save a little cash on a Highlander can still expect the same quality, versatility and durability as that of other SUVs costing much more.
