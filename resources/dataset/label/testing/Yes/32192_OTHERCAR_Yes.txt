            The first thing that struck me about the current Cavalier was how small it looked from the outside.  It seemed smaller than the Dodge Neon and Mazda Protege (aka Ford Escort) I'd rented in the past.  Even after I had a look inside, it struck me as a little smaller than the Neon, and not any bigger than the Protege.

Size isn't everything, though - when I had the opportunity to drive a Cavalier for a week, it proved to be a very comfortable car, with a decent amount of room for passengers and cargo.  Not to say the cargo space is unlimited, of course - I had quite a time figuring out how to put two boxed bicycles into it!  (Hint: put one in behind the front seats, then flip the back seat down and slide the other in through the trunk - yes, it works!)

Performance and mileage were pretty good, too - even going over the mountains here, it accelerated respectably for a car with a 4-cylinder engine, full of passengers and luggage.

The Cavalier isn't the sort of rental that really stands out in my memory - it was a good, utilitarian car that did its job well.  And that's what economy cars are all about, right?  It's certainly on the list of cars I'd consider next time I rent.<br><br>
