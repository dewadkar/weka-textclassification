            17 yrs old, and looking for a car.

  That is how my whole story started, now that I'm 20 yrs old there is no way that I will let this story stop.

  My first car (that I paid for) was a 73' \X/(vw) Westfalia (camper).  It was big, orange, and BEAUTIFUL! I thought it was wonderful, I bought it without knowing how to drive a stick, (but I made it a point to learn)and knowing nothing about the car it's self--other then I wanted it. 

  I bought the car in May, and it was fully running by July.  We had some dificulty getting it to run because it did not have the correct engine in it. That might have been a set back for some people, but when you have a very GOOD Volkswagen shop in the area it makes it easier.  My stepfather, put hundreds of hours in working on the motor, installing an electric fuel pump, and removing the rotted heater core, ect.  It was not an easy task doing the work even with the book, but if you know anything about cars you can figure it out.

  Right before I graduated high school, I decided that I needed a more practical car for my job.  So my parents decided that they were going to sell my pride and joy and buy me a pick up truck (from hippie to redneck  :( ).  We sold the van, and I regreted it.  So when I had enough money I went out and found myself another one.  I bought a diffrent year and a diffrent model, one that would be suitable for my needs (driving around my daughter).  Knowing that my family was able to work on the engine to make it run its best.  With the help of EXPERTS we have it half way there.  <b>This one I will not let go of :), no matter what my parents say.</b>
  
  There have been some things I have learned from mistakes- and I will gladly pass them on to you.

<b>  some tips before buying Volkswagen's:</b>
 
    * Make sure the floor boards are sound, no rust or holes !!!
    * Look for a model with a/c and/or heat! (especially if you live in a 
      cold climate.)
    * For you worried parents- SEAT BELTS! Models newer then 71' should
      have driver and passenger seat belts, some have rear seatbelts.
    * If possible, take it for a nice long drive- many problems show up
      at stop lights, while ideling.
    * A color you can live with.
    * SHOP AROUND, just because you see only one in the paper does not 
      mean there are not more out there.  Do not settle on the first one,
      because you think it is the right one.
    * Find a shop that specialized in Volkswagen's and ask advice and if 
      they might know of any for sale.
    * price is everything- the more you pay the better it WILL be. It 
      probably means that they put more working into it then cheaper ones.
    * And ENJOY! Treasure them.

  Volkswagens are safe, and reliable if they are taken care of properly!
I trust these vehicles enough to place my daughter's car seat in them. 

  I enjoy the ride, they are roomy and easy to handle (with or without power steering).  They take a little bit of getting use to, but after those first awkward weeks you are a master at it.  
 
  enjoy! and happy hunting!
