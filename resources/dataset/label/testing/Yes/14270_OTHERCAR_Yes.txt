            When you tell people you drive an RX-7 they immediately question its reliability. I can only speak for the second generation cars but for some reason these cars have an undeserved bad wrap for reliability. Ok, it is not as reliable as a 95 Civic, but it is just as good as any similar model year car with 100K miles on it. I have driven it for two years commuting 80 miles to school each day and have not had any repair cost besides routine maintenance. It has always started even in the coldest sub zero weather. However, you CAN NOT abuse this car. You must keep oil in it as it burns a small amount on purpose, change the oil regularly, and you can NEVER let it overheat. If you do these simple things the engine on a NA will easily last 150+k miles. Unfortunately, the electronics just plain suck. If you are handy with a soldering iron you can fix most of the problems however they are still annoying. The car also floods if you do not let it warm up before you turn it off (as result of a buggy computer.) That�s all the negatives, all cars have some, here are the positives. As it has been mention before in this forum this car handles on a level few other cars can match. The car is just quick enough to make it fun to drive (Turbo II�s are much faster), but be assured that it is no drag racer. However, on a curvy road while exploring the upper reaches of the tach few cars can keep up with you. Gas mileage varies dramatically depending on how you drive it. In the summer doing strictly highway driving I once got 29 mpg. However, driving just around town I usually get about 19. The car is light but it has a quality feel that is hard to define. It is also relatively safe considering its minuscule size. The 2+2 �emergency� seats are just about useless unless you drive around a small child. If you are looking for an economical true sports cars there is simply no better value; it�s a blast to drive and unlike some others reliable enough to be a everyday vehicle.
