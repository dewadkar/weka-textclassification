            We were looking to get my wife a 4-door car for the possibility of future additions to the family. We looked at the Accord, Camary, Galant, and Altima. All of the cars had similar interior features that were nice. The interior of the S40 did not have the �cheap plastic� feel that others had�.I�m not saying that the car didn�t have a plastic feel, it just didn�t feel cheap. 
There is an odd little cubby hole in the console near the radio that looks like a pack of Tic-Tacs would fit in�..they don�t. Still trying to figure out what they were thinking we could use that space for�...another odd thing about this car. The passenger side seat doesn't have a lever to recline the seat, you have to turn a dial on the side to do this....huh? 

I am very impressed with the handling of this car. I like to take a curve like I�m driving an Indy car. Going into a curve, you can feel the car adapt to force and it grips to the road. 

The trunk space is very good. It has a belt strap that you can attach to two different areas in the trunk to keep your cargo from rolling all over the place when your taking those curves at 70. 

The radio needs some work�..we can be driving along and a local station will fade out then back in. We didn�t get the CD player because it was part of another option package and we were on a budget! 
Don�t let the dealership offer to put the Volvo CD changer in. The Volvo dealership in Winston-Salem gave us a quote of ��are you sitting down?��.$900. 
We�re planning on going to Best Buy and have one put in for $300 total. 

Maintenance for the S40 is not bad. Oil change at every 5000 miles is about $24.00 (dealer special) 
I didn�t let them talk me into the 10,000-mile check up. What�s in the 10,000-mile check up you ask. They top off the fluids, check the brakes and tires, change the oil, wash it and do some other trivial service and charge you almost $300. Hmm�.I think I can look and see if there�s windshield washer fluid and if we lost transmission fluid, we would notice that real quick. 

Safety and Price was the main reason for the purchase of this car. We went at the end of the month, acted like we didn�t care that much for the car and insisted that we get above blue book for our trade in and it worked. 

We trust the Volvo name and we are very happy with our decision.
