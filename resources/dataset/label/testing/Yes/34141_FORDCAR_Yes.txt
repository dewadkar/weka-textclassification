            I bought my '91 Vic in 12/94 for 3400 dollars. It was an old Ohio State Patrol car with the 351 cu. in./5.8 litre engine with 88,000 miles on the clock. I'm still driving it today having racked up another 124,000 miles on it. 

This car is one of the most dependable I have ever owned. Other than regular maintenance, which is easily done, it has needed little else. It would be easier to list the trouble spots instead. 
The Vic tends to be hard on front brakes. Also, being a typical Ford Windsor engine, the rocker cover and oil pan gaskets will leak. The rocker gaskets aren't much trouble to replace, and can be done at home. But unless you have an overhead crane to lift the engine up for the pan gasket, expect to take it to a garage. Electrical problems were few, although the front power door locks froze and rusted up. I hear that is a common complaint. Other than these things, I really haven't had much else to complain about.

Being a Police option, my car came with the 2.73 Traction-Lok rear axle. It hurts performance off the line, but helps with good highway power. Even with this ratio, my fuel mileage is 14 city/19 highway. Not the best, but pretty good considering the size and weight of the car. The 5.0 litre engine with the 3.08 axle has slightly better mileage, but doesn't have the same performance. 

The body is solid, but is prone to rust in certain places: Behind the tailights, at the upper corners of the windshield, and at the rear doors near the leading edge near the bottom. This is common to all CV's.

I know that other owners will have different problems than mine, but I can't find too much wrong with my particular model. I've found this car has done everything I've ever asked of it, and it has never let me down. I don't baby my cars, nor do I abuse them. This car is a real workhorse and I recommend it.
