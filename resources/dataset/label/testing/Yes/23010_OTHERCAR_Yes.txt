            If you are a person who does not like a lot of confusion when using a camera then the Polaroid PDC - 640 is for you. The camera itself is the simplest digital camera I have used. After I got it for a mere $179, I turned it on and was able to use it without the help of the instructions, and the instructions for the camera itself are easy to understand and use if you need to. I have used other digital cameras and they can be quite confusing to use. This one I was very pleased with. The camera itself comes with a 2MB smart media card and can use up to a 8MB card. You have 4 setting for resolution, the higher the resolution the less pictures you can take with the camera.  With the highest setting which is 5 stars (not some confusing number like 8064 etc...)you can take 12 pictures with a 2MB smart media card, and 96 on the lowest 1 star setting. It also has a lcd screen which you can use to focus in on the picture or a view window but be aware that using the lcd screen will drain batteries! Once you have taken the pictures you can hook the camera up with the serial adapter that is included. The software is simple to use, and it did not take long to install. You can modify you pictures with the software and even morph them which is fun. Another good thing about this camera is after it downloads the pictures they will be jpg's not some other format so you do not have to keep changing formats. This camera is great for the person whom just likes to take pictures and just wants something easy to use. It is great to pull out for B-day parties, weddings, sporting events, vacations, and it's great for taking pictures for online auctions... 
Included in the kit are a carrying case, video cable (so you can make avi's and use it as a video camera for the computer or even hook it up to the vcr), batteries, power supply,carrying stap, and software.  <br><br>
