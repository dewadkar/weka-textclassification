            I had been considering purchasing a Lumina, i had rented one and it drove well and i got great gas mileage. It had one draw back for me, as a big guy  (6'3&quot; 280lbs) it was a tight fit getting in the car. While at the dealership i saw the Monte Carlo, the same looking car with a BIGGER door.
I got in and It had more room inside to, I was in love !!!. It drove the same, rode the same.....WOW i was sold.
I sell working in four southern states  driving as much as 1300 miles a week. I keep my trunk full of paper brochures &amp; samples so it stays loaded with stuff. The mileage is very good i must say i get 31 to 36 MPG driving the speed limit of 70 on interstate 10.  
The one thing i have found that is a pain to me is the 15 Gallon fuel tank, I am a driver i get behind the wheel i want to GO,i think a 20-22 gallon tank would be more to my liking.
If your a tall big person this car will sure be comfortable for you, GIVE IT A TEST DRIVE.
I think it should be the next convertable for chevy, what a great size car.<br><br>
