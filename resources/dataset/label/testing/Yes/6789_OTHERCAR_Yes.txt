            This is the nicest vehicle I have ever driven and that was when I was 13. They handle much better than the old Land Rovers and I think they are tougher and better than the Range Rovers and Discovery's. When I get my license I will definatly buy one. I would recommend the Defender 90 to anyone who likes to go four-wheeling or needs a work vehicle. I love the colors offered but I don't like the hardtops because I think they look better in soft tops. They are pretty good compared to Jeeps and the Defender has some out on top quite a few times from the articles I've read. If you're deciding between the Defender and the Jeep, I guess I'd take the Defender because I've been brought up in a Rover  family and personally I think Rovers are pretty tough. I guess I'm done now so I hope I affected your opinion on the Defender 90.<br><br>
