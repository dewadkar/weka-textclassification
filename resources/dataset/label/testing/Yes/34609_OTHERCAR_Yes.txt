            After searching thru ads and car lots for almost a year, I finally found
a used Suzuki that fit my requirements almost perfectly. Living in
Nebraska, I have wanted and needed a 4-wheel drive vehicle for years. I 
have  looked at bigger SUV's and the price always scared me away. The 
smaller Jeep models of CJ-5 was really nice, but very expensive. After
lots of looking, I had decided on a GEO Tracker as the most practical
and economical to buy. I passed a certain used car lot several times on
the way to work and spied what I thought was a White Tracker. That evening
I visited the lot after work and found it to be a Suzuki Sidekick. I fell
in love with it immediately.  It was almost all the things I had always 
wanted in a SUV and the price was reasonable. Of course it has 4-wheel 
drive, it is a soft-top that can be driven as a convertible, or just
roll back part of the top to have a sun-roof. ( I loved that option ).
It has a super sounding CD player. And power everything. Wow.
   Now for you negative epinion writers out there, I did do my research
before buying it. I did find that these SUV's and Trackers both have a
history of roll-over problems. Insurance companies are careful because
of this history. Well, I have been driving for 30 years and I do not plan
to go around any sharp curves at 80 miles an hour. Anyway, I love it.<br><br>
