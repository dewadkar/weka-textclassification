            I just purchased this car a couple of weeks ago.  I am overly satisfied.  This car is sleek, rugged, and luxurious.  Driving this car with a stick shift is like playing a video game.  It's just so much fun.  Every morning when i go to work I am anxious to get into my car.  I live in Mass. so the snow here can get pretty bad.  In this BMW, the snow is not a factor.  The grip on the road is remarkable and I have never felt anything like it.  If you are looking into buying a BMW this is the model to purchase.
