            My wife needed a step up from her old 1985 Chevy Sprint (1.0 liter 3-cylinder engine - very weak but great gas mileage - even better than the subsequent Geo Metro).  Enough about the Sprint.  We found a great metallic blue 1990 Ford Escort LX (two door model - same body as the Ford Escort GT model) at a great price.  The Escort was a 5-speed manual transmission - thank GOD (the automatics are very whimpy - my sister had one)!  That car handled like a sports car - a little more power would have been nice!  I still can't believe that a Ford Escort could handle the road so well!  Remember, this is the early 90s body style - the newer Escorts are uglier and not as well built.  A good solid car.  Just make sure that you replace parts and maintain the car the way the manual tells you to.  The timing belt and water pump promptly failed at 60,000 miles.  Otherwise, this was a great car!  They don't make them like they used to.<br><br>
