            I have been a loyal Lexus ES300 driver for over four years now.  My first was a 92 pre-owned, and I now drive a 97.  It is a great car, and you will always get the red carpet treatment at Lexus.  For example, one of my heated seats wasn't working, and they ordered the wrong part.  Because of the delay in fixing the problem, they gave me touch-up paint at no charge and a discount on a CD carousel.  They definitely take care of you.  As I mentioned, my first car was a true pre-owned vehicle, and I felt I got a pretty good deal on it.  However, when I went to trade it in, I learned that they sell their loaner cars when they reach approximately 15,000 miles (at least my local dealership does, so I assume most or all do).  These cars have only been owned by Lexus, they've had all maintenance done, and they are newer with lower miles than other &quot;pre-owned&quot; cars (which are usually several years, not months, old).  I bought my car practically new at a discounted price and didn't take a huge &quot;new car&quot; depreciation.  I don't think this is something they actively market, because I never heard about it until I started asking questions and got a good sales person.  In summary, I highly recommend this car and also suggest their pre-owned loaner cars.<br><br>
