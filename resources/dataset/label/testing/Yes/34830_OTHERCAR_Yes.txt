            I love everything about our new Honda EX.  
Before we purchased this, I did a lot of research on the Edmunds.com forums.  We researched Suburbans as well as other mini-vans.  I was always one of those people that swore I would never own a mini-van -- and here I am.  I am so glad we looked into one for our growing family.  
The space is incredible and it's so easy for the kids to get in and out of by themselves.  I was growing rather tired of always having to lift them into our Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Now I don't know how we ever lived without one.
We narrowed our choices down to Honda or Toyota b/c of our bad experience with Chrysler products.  We'll never own another Chrysler because of all the horrible experiences we have had with three of their vehicles.  I know many people love them, and I'm glad they haven't had the same experiences we have.
We decided on the Honda for a couple of reasons.  The interior was more spacious than the Toyota, it came with a traction control system and the engine was more powerful.  The fold-away third seat was also a huge plus.  I love the well the seat folds into -- gives much more cargo space even when the seat's up.  The third seat can also fold backwards so that you can use it as a tail-gate seat or even as a diaper-changing area.
The crash test results were all excellent, which was also a major factor in our decision.
Honda's reputation is wonderful, and we have had absolutely no second thoughts.  Sure, there are lots of fun gadgets on the other mini-vans, but those can all be bought after-market if you think you really need them, for a minimal cost.  The Honda has exactly what we need.  The only thing I would add, would be an outside temperature reading.  I got used to having that with our Jeep and just kind of miss knowing how cold it is outside.  Nothing major, just a novelty.  
The Odyssey has a very smooth ride, a powerful V6 engine, it shifts effortlessly and handles very easily.  I have not encountered any problems with visibility or parking.  The leg room is wonderful, the head room is spacious, the seats are comfortable and the captains chairs keep my children separated nicely.  The captains chairs may also slide together to form a bench seat. Perfect! 
I love the dual powered doors that can be operated by your remote.  This is especially handy in the winter time when you have your hands full and want to get your kids in the car as soon as possible.  Just a click of the button and the door is open by the time you get to your van.  This is our dream mini-van.
We also have the navigation option.  This thing is incredible!  It is DVD-based and will give you directions to anywhere you'd like to go.  The maps are very nice and it also gives you voice directions so you don't need to look down while driving.  When the navigation system is not being used, the screen serves as a touch-screen for your a/c and fan controls.  It is a very fun and useful feature.  
I love everything about this versatile van and I'm sure you will too!
