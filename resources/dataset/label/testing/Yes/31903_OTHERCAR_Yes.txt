            This is the end. Fini. No more. I shall not darken the epinions auto door again. I am mechanically oriented, but I hate car shopping. I write this epinions as the grand finale of our recent marathon shopping spree.

My wife wanted power. Translated, that meant zip. It�s not that she wanted the ability to outrun the highway patrol. She�s far too savvy and understands that they resort to helicopters. She wanted a family vehicle that would perform at the traffic light. She wanted to leave the Porsches, Corvettes, and Ferraris in her dust. That, of course, was not to be. She wanted a station wagon, minivan, or SUV with some utility. One rarely sees the odd minivan or SUV on the Indy 500 or dragster tracks.

Of all the vehicles tested, the Saturn LW2 wagon was my initial favorite. It had a lot of bang for the buck. It also had a unique sales staff who tended to be more like family than car salespeople. It was not to be. As responsive and as fun to drive as it was, the bucket seats were uncomfortable to my one and only.

Since this was HER car, we pressed on. She loved, as did I, the Volkswagen Passat wagon. My only complaints were the price and the mystery involving the engine. It was totally covered! Unlike the jeep where I could touch and change the oil filter, this engine was a mystery solved only with a socket wrench.

She gravitated toward the Ford Taurus Wagon. With a V6, it had the power. It was reasonably priced. It had an option for a third row of seats, the aspect that had steered her to the Ford Windstar Van. I nixed both. The Taurus wagon had a horrendous hit on first year depreciation. The Windstar, though very comfortable, had a weak suspension system. (I was thrown side-to-side in the turns. The vehicle rocked when punching the rear bumper.)

She gave up on wagons and concentrated on SUV�s. I knocked out much of the competition with a review of safety characteristics. (Although I carry life insurance on her, a 60% chance of severe injury or death did not appeal. I rather like the lady.) That narrowed it to the Subaru Forester or the Ford Explorer.

<b>Final choice</b>

My son loved the Explorer. He had his own audio station in back. (That also appeals to parents who don�t care to listen to rap music.) He loved the Windstar for the same reason, adding his own air-conditioning controls that preclude the front occupants from suffering to keep the rear occupants comfortable. Still, his greatest concern was did the vehicle have a CD player? The Forester did not, at least in the options we were considering.

The All Wheel Drive in the Forester gave some get-up-and-go to the four cylinder engine. My wife loved it. It had zip! I loved the options. Even the �L� series, their low end product, had all of the needed options like ABS. What it didn�t have, and we discovered this on vehicle delivery, was vanity mirrors. Those devices that rest behind the visors were not present. She decided that, at $100 a pop, she would rely on her natural beauty. They were not required.

Another oddity was side impact airbags. You had to go to their top-of-the-line model, complete with moon roof and other unnecessary items, to get them. I was both baffled and pleased. I was baffled that I couldn�t add the option to protect my family. I was pleased that, since it was an offered option on some of the Foresters, the insurance industry had not put it on the �hit� list. (I noticed that many vehicles on the �above average� insurance rates were those that did not offer side impact airbags.) 

What it did have was a keyless entry, numerous 12V outlets for my laptop and cellphone, and a beer cooler. A what? Yes, there was a device residing in the spare tire, a full sized spare I might add, that one could use to cool drinks. Not being a tailgater, I filled it with a more practical set of jumper cables.

Yes, I read the articles in the magazines and on the web. Built on a station wagon chassis, the Forester was not a stellar performer in the great out back. No problem. We didn�t get the vehicle for that purpose. The All Wheel Drive was necessary for the little four-banger to perform to my wife�s standards. Because it was a smaller engine, the gas mileage was far better than the Explorer or other more rugged vehicles. I personally liked the All Wheel Drive concept for inclement weather. Subaru was the first to come out with the AWD station wagon and I loved it when we were living in snow country.

The station wagon heritage gave a smoother ride while lacking the sway experienced in the minivans. The 60/40 rear seat (standard for the Forester but an option on most vehicles) provided her with the cargo room she needed. (My bride has replaced her night school craft classes with woodshop.) If more cargo space is required, it also came with a roof rack complete with adjustable crossbars and skid plates to protect the roof. (Strange as it may seem, many of the vehicles didn�t have the skid plates and the crossbars were an option.) We added the cargo cover and cargo net as options. That, as part of a package, strangely added an exhaust pipe cover, which I didn�t want. (It has already started showing heat stains.) What I truly admired was the large rubber mat covering the cargo area. I now foresee a camping trip that won�t be followed by an auto rug cleaning exercise.

The purchase was the end result of a lot of comparisons. Though I had decided early in the process that the Forester was the �best bang for your buck,� I didn�t vocalize it. It was my wife�s vehicle and she had to choose. She noted that it had far more �standard� equipment than most. The options offered were competitively priced. She liked the way it drove. Our dealer did not have a white one, so we delayed while he looked. After a week, I went on the web and located several nearby dealers who did have her vehicle. I conducted an auction and bought it from the man with the sharpest pencil.

In spite of my adventurous nature and desire to go where no man has gone before, I still refuse to drive the new vehicle. I do not intend to be the one that spills the first cup of coffee or places the erstwhile blemish on the car that she refers to as <b>�MY Subaru.�</b> What is the best thing I can say about the car? A neighbor came home with a new Toyota SUV the same day as I picked up the Subaru. He took a test drive in our car and returned his Toyota, which had already shed its first piece of molding. He has now joined us as happy Subaru owners.
