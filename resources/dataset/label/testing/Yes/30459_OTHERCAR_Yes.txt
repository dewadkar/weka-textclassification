            Toyota continues to maintain it's niche in the compact car segment by improving Corolla year after year.The engine gets ever so slightly more power each year and the hallmark of this model which is low maintenance cost is being kept intact. It's a car that delivers above average overall performance at a reasonable price.
I have had a chance to drive this car from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas,Mexico twice. Both times it has been in the month of August with average temperatures in the 90's and a punishing 100% humidity when you drive along the Sea of Cortez.On both occasions the trip was made in a day and a half with the Air Conditioning on at all times. Corolla's 1.8l engine was trouble free and strong enough for over taking slower vehicles. Furthermore it delivered 32.1 MPG.
The few problem that plague this car are extremely soft shock absorbers which bottom out if you have four people in the car with no luggage in the trunk!!. The seats can be firmer for longer rides. I found out that I was sinking after about an hour of driving. A lot of road noise enters the cabin because of the rigid Firestone tires that are great for obtaining high milage but not for noise damping. The rear/firewall engine mount also needed replacement after only 40 thousand miles.
Overall, I recommend this car for everyday commute and in town/local driving.<br><br>
