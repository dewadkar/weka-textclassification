            I purchased my 1997 Dodge Stratus ES in Oct. of 1996, since then I have had 4 MAJOR problems with the cars front end, Thrown Ty-Rods and bad bushings, Axles on the way out and Klunks and Clanks galore! all within the so called &quot;Bumper to bumper extended warrantee that I paid over $1,000 for, But did they cover them&gt;?? Heck NO! They consider them normal wear and tear.. excuse me? Bumper to Bumper should cover it all right? and since when does a cars front end let go in 2 years?  Then need another similar repair in 11 months?? I dont take it 4-wheeling or  cross country.. But to the grocery store, work etc.
Also, the car windows fog up constantly when the heat is on.. my windows steam up like a teenagers parked on a side road at midnight, but my car doesnt see that kind of action.. so why can't I see out my side window?
The clips on the rear seat belts designed to keep child safety seats secure broke within a month, both of them. The fan used to control heat and Air Conditioning lets off a high pitched squeal when at full blast, which I have had several times brought to the attention of Dodge technicions, Is constant and annoying! My overall opinion is that I wasted my money and Dodge has let me down.. I have only owned MOPAR my whole life.. but this last car has made me consider maybe straying and buying a Chevy or Ford next.. Very disapointing Dodge!<br><br>
