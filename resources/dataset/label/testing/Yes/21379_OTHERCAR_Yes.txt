            Is it possible to love a car?  YES!!  I absolutely love this car.  I own a 99 model, and i got mine straight off the trust. I am not kidding it still had plastic on the seats, and the rubber things that keep parts from moving while in tow (and it only had 1.5 miles on it..not bad if i do say so myself).  This car is comfortable drive.  I do a lot of long distance driving with my family and i must admit that the space makes it a very comfortable drive.  ABS, dual airbags, tilt steering.  The one reason why i bought another camry (this being my third one)  is because when you get into an accident is, the car usually is affected by the accident and never quite runs the same afterwards.  Well when my mom crashed my camry (both 92 and 96 models, the car still worked the same as before.  Unlike their other models.  For this rason alone i keep buying a camry. I am not too happy with the colors that were available when i bought but i am pretty hppy with what i got.<br><br>
