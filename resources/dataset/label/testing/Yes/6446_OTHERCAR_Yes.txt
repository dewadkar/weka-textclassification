            I bought a 1995 Camry in 1996.  It was used, had 32,000 miles, and ran like a dream.  It is still running like a dream, with only a few minor repairs, with over 92,000 miles now. I feel that this car should run for at least another 100,000 miles with only minor repairs, because that is the reputation that Toyota has.

This model of Camry is a little low to the ground and hits on speed bumps sometimes, if they are high.  The new Camry's are higher and don't have this problem.  

Camry gets great gas mileage around town.  I get 375-400 miles from a 15 gallon tank in stop and go traffic.  Road trips give even better mileage. 

My Camry has tons of room both in the backseat, the front seat, and the trunk.  I can fill it with loads of people, groceries, and even two upholstered chairs from an auction. My son who is 6'2&quot; doesn't mind sitting in the back seat, even on trips that last over 20 minutes. 

I love the features that Camry offers, which are very similar to a Lexus. They both have large, clear instrument panels, cup holders in the middle, which hold two cups (this is VERY important for those of us who need our Diet Coke when we drive), and driver and passenger airbags.  If you sit in a Lexus and then in a Camry of the same year, you might not realize which was which.  

Camry's offer both leather and fabric upholstery, instant power upon acceleration, wonderful front disk brakes, and an ability to maneuver in the snow without special snow tires. 

I recommend Camry for those with the taste of champagne but budget of diet Coke. You will feel like royalty when you drive a Camry.<br><br>
