            In my opinion, the Honda Accord is one of the most popular high school and college cars. I saw more Accord at high school than any other car, and I see many at college. This car is also a great family car. The only real negative aspect of this car is the high resale value. If you are looking for one as a used car, expect to pay a hefty price. 

I think that the most appealing part of this car is the openness and practicality. The back seat has a very large amount of room. It is easily bigger than a car such as the Ford Tempo, and maybe close to a large car. From the outside, the Accord looks somewhat small, but from the inside, it is quite large. The window space is more than enough. The car is very light inside, and it this gives the car an openness. The front seats are also very spacious. They are comfortable, and give good back support. The center cluster (radio and climate) is a little difficult to use, but it has big buttons, so it is easy to understand. I prefer rotary controls, and the Accord doesn't have only rotary controls, there are also quite a few buttons. The radio is also very low, and it is a little hard to reach. I also noticed that the car doesn't seem that wide. It is wider than a compact car, but some cars of its size seem to have a little more room in between the seats. 

The standard engine on the Accord is about 2 liters, I-4. I a pretty sure that it doesn't have variable valve timing, which would give you some power and better gas mileage. It doesn't give the driver a lot of power, but it is not underpowered by any means. If you really need more power, look at the V-6, it should give you all the power you want in a family car(if you need even more, look at a Maxima, or BMW-type car). The handling on the Accord is good, and the suspension is also good. I wouldn't consider them as good as many sports cars, but for a family car, the Accord is quite nimble. You probably won't find any problems with the handling of the Accord unless you're racing the car, or really like to drive fast on small winding roads. Going over bumps is a little harsh, but the good seats and fairly good suspension seem to help. 

The Accord isn't as safe as a Volvo, but it is considered very safe. The model I am referring to did not have a passenger-air bag, and I am not sure that the 1993 has that as an option. I am a firm believer that seat belts are the most important, and this car obviously has those. If you find a good used Accord without a passenger airbag, I would still consider it, even if you are very safety conscious, because overall, this is a very safe car. I do think that the Camry is rated a little higher than the Accord, and the Taurus (in 1993) was also considered very safe. The Taurus is a little bigger, which sacrifices handling and ride, but makes a car safer.

Overall, the Accord is a great choice for a used-family car. The negative is that it is fairly expensive as a used car. There are cases when you may be getting a very poor deal. The blue-book prices are usually very high, and sometimes, the Accord isn't worth the list price. But, if you choose to buy an Accord, you'll probably be very happy, and not have many problems. The Accord has a very good reliability record. <br><br>
