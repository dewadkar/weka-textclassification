            I bought the Powershot S100 as a gift for my wife.  She wanted a simple to use, point and shoot camera.  I knew the benefits of digital photography and wanted to convince her this was the way to go.  

The Powershot S100 was a smash as soon as she opened it.  It's sexy, easy to use, small, lightweight - all the things my wife wanted.  From my point of view, it takes standard compact flash (I bought a 64Mb card to go with it), has a USB port for quick downloads to your PC, has 2.1 megapixel resolution, a 2X optical zoom - 3X digital, has rechargable battery pack and produces photo quality images.  The big bonus came when I used the included software (Cannon ZoomBrowser and Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition) to crop and enhance pictures.  We've used the ofoto site to upload images and have also ordered prints from them (although prints on your home inkjet come out great too if you use the right materials).<br><br>
