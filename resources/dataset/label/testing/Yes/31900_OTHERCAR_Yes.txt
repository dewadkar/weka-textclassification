            Ok, we bought this car in 1997 because we had a third child on the way &amp; wanted something that would fit us all comfortably.  We looked around for about 6 months before finally choosing one.  We bought a 1992 with 53,000 miles on it.  We found it at a dealership &amp; it looked as if it had been treated pretty well.

I loved how with the four doors the carseats &amp; kids went in with ease, as before we had a two door Regal &amp; which was somewhat more difficult.  The ride is smooth, even now 55,000 miles later.  It has power seats &amp; windows which are nice, but with every luxury, there's a chance for mechanical troubles.  

The first thing to go was the battery.  Now, I know, you need to replace a battery every so often, but ours has gone through a few &amp; we've basically given up.  It started last year &amp; now I usually go out a half hour before I want to leave to make sure the car will start &amp; if not, I put it on a plug in battery charger.  It's just when it sits for long periods like overnight, but it's a pain.  We've had the electrical checked but no one can find any shorts.  Our next &quot;plan&quot; since this is getting so annoying, is to try out Sears new batteries that will shut themselves off if they're being drained.  Watch for my review of it once we buy one!

Next was the switch on the power windows.  It's made of plastic &amp; during a snow storm (of course!) it wouldn't go up after I stopped at the bank.  Luckily I was near a dealership &amp; they got me in, but $150!!!  Yikes!  Another thing with the power windows is that during the winter (Michigan-cold winter here!) they're sometimes finicky &amp; won't always go down, so if you're a drive-thru person, you may want to consider manual windows in any car purchase you make.  We're not talking that the window is frozen, it just sometimes won't go down, even after the car has been warmed up or has come from the garage, and the only times it's happened so far have been in the winter.

Now as for my overall opinion, yes, this car is comfy &amp; nice &amp; luxurious &amp; definitely a smooth ride (watch that speedometer, you're going faster than you think!) &amp; I would buy it again, but the headaches we've had over the battery &amp; windows still leave me with some negativity.<br><br>
