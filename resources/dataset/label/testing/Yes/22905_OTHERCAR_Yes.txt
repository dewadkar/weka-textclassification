            Let me start out by saying that I&#146m not a professional writer/reviewer, and this is my first review on a vehicle. The only thing that I have going for me, is that this is my second GMC Sierra. I plan on doing a bit of comparison been my older 1999 model, and the new <b>GMC Sierra 1500 SLE</b> that I own now. I will say that the 1999 model was a very good truck, and was free of any troubles for the 4 years and almost 60,000 miles that I drove it. I would expect no less from the new 2003 which I bought about 3 months ago. I traded off the 1999 only due to the lease running out, and money issues. More or less the 2003 was a better deal in the long haul then buying out the lease on my 1999. Both models are short beds, and have very comparable features.

<b>Comfortable </b>
After owning the earlier model of this truck, I decided to look around a bit to see what the competition offered. I must say there are some nice trucks out there on the market, but I felt the most comfortable and at home in the GMC. Being a big person 6&#1461&#148 about 270 pounds, I can honestly say that this is the only truck that I didn&#146t feel cramped in. The seats are comfortable, and well designed. The folding armrest is wonderful and adds some nice storage for CD&#146s, flashlights and even tools. The Steer Wheel is easily adjusted to the desired setting. Much of what I said here applies to both trucks GMC Trucks that I&#146ve owned. 

<b>Powerful</b>
The 5.3L engine is very powerful, and can easily throw you back into your seat. I would not have bought this truck without this engine. My experience with hauling and towing has been very pleasurable. I pull a 6&#146 by 12&#146 utility trailer that weighs 900 pounds empty plus 2000 to 2500 pounds of coal with not problems what so ever. I believe this truck could easily do more, but the weight restrictions of my trailer are limited to around a ton. The 5300L engine is the perfect blend between gas mileage, and power for me. This was a major selling point for me on this truck.

<b>Controls </b>
Some controls on this truck are a bit different from my 1999 model. The temperature control now has two controls, one for the driver and one for the passenger and is located to the right of the steering wheel. Also the control to open and close the window is a bit different. You now push down it to open the window, and pull up to close it. The turn signals, wipers, cruise control, and windshield washer are all still on the turn signal handle. This is very handy, and easily accessible. The Headlights switch now has an on/off position which is something the 1999 model did not have. The light control has 4 positions off, auto, park lights, and headlights, and is just to the left of the steer wheel. The 4 wheel drive push buttons are located to the right of the headlights and behind the steering wheel, and include auto, 2wd, 4wd low, and 4wd high.  This button when pushed engages the 4wd in about 10 seconds, and can be used on the fly. The radio/CD player is to the right of the steering wheel, and is very easy to reach. The sound quality is very good, but I&#146m not an expert. The controls are pretty much self explanatory. 

<b>Appearance</b>
The appearance of this truck is beautiful. The rounded hood and front end are perfect. The grill is silver adding accent to the solid color. The sides are very nicely designed, and come with silver molding that service two purposes. One purpose is, it breaks up the solid colored side nicely and it also services as protection against door dings from other vehicles. All in all my new truck is very pretty. I added a black bug shield, black spray-on bed liner, black rail protectors to set it off. 

<b>Durability</b>
It&#146s too early to tell about the long term durability of this truck, but my 1999 GMC didn&#146t cost me a penny other than tires and regular upkeep. I would expect no less from the newer model. These trucks are built very tough.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
 In a regular week I drive been 250-300 miles to and from work and around the local area. The city to highway ratio is about 50/50, and I get between 17-18 MPG normally. In my opinion that is pretty good, considering I owned a 1996 GMC Jimmy with a 43.L 6 cylinder and I got comparable numbers. 

<b>Safety and Security</b>
There a quite a few really nice safety features on this truck. First there is a driver&#146s side, and passenger side airbag. The passenger side airbag can be turned off, or if left on only activates if someone is sitting in the seat. It turns off and on by sensing weight in the seat. The keyless entry is a great feature, and at night the truck is lit up like a Christmas tree when you unlock the truck. The truck also automatically leaves those lights on when you lock it and turns them off after about 30 seconds. There are two lights under each side mirrors to help you see at the door areas. Also the doors lock as soon as you put the truck in gear, and unlock when the gearshift is put in park. There is a sensor on the headlights that turns them on automatically when it gets dark and the switch is in the auto position. The daytime driving lights are bright enough to make sure that the truck is seen easily by other drivers. There is an alarm that acts as a theft prevention device which is called the &#147PASSlock II&#148.  This truck as most other GMCs, has ABS brakes. ABS is an antilock braking system which allows you to put full pressure on the brake pedal in slippery conditions. The computer senses when a wheel is not moving, and takes over with a brake and release method that stops the vehicle quicker. Also the brake get a warning noise the pads are wearing out. 

<b>Things that I don&#146t like</b>
There are a few things that I don&#146t like about this truck. First is the fabric that is use on the seats. The 1999 model that I owned had two holes in the driver&#146s seat from sitting in it. I wear jeans all the time, and I think the seam of the back pocket wore through the material. The 2003's seats are made exactly the same material so be prepared to add a seat cover immediately. Also the tires that came with this truck were a joke. Goodyear Wrangler ST tires are not of any use on a vehicle like this. I promptly traded them in and got a more aggressive thread design. 

<b>Warranty Information</b>
GMC offers the standard 3 years/36,000 miles warranty on this truck. It covers everything from bumper to bumper that is a defect in materials or workmanship. Towing costs are also covered during that time. Also coverage for the steel metal against corrosion, and rust through for 6 years/100,000 miles.  

<b>Technical Stuff</b>
Vortec 5300 V8 Engine (295 horsepower @ 5200rpm)

Seating capacity is 3 persons.

<b>Pricing</b>
The 2004 models were all ready on the lots when I went looking for a new truck. I had a bit of a hard time finding a 2003 model, but I think that I got a wonderful deal. The sticker price was $29,325, but with the rebates and some dealing the final cost was $22,700. I realize that this truck was already one year old, but this leftover only had 50 miles on it. I consider it brand new and since I plan on keeping this truck a long time, the year was not an issue to me. The $6,600 looked great in my pocket.

<b>I do love this truck</b>
I guess that I&#146m biased by the performance of the 1999 model that I owned, but I think truck is going to be a very good vehicle. It drives like a tank in a good way, because I feel very safe on the roads with it. The pulling power along with the comfortable ride is perfect for my needs. Mainly driving to and from work, and haul and towing my trailer are the reasons for this purchase. The gas mileage is better than a comparable Ford or Dodge. This truck has the looks and durability to last me the 10-12 years that I want to keep it. If you are look for a great comfortable work truck that has plenty of pulling power then this is the truck for you.
