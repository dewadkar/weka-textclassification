            When looking for a new pick up truck I test drove a lot of small models.I found that the sonoma,while looking good did not have the leg room I needed.I'm 5'10&quot; tall with long legs and I found that it was cramped in the leg room area.I also felt trapped in the cab,I like to feel like I have some room around me.I did like it's power and looks,and found it to be competatively priced.I finally settled on a different brand,but did suggest to GMC that they add leg room and cab room so that people like me that like to buy american can get dependability and the room we need.A buyer of the sonoma should be someone that is smaller in stature,but still enjoys having fun driving a truck.I prefer trucks over cars,and I guess some people find that strange with me being a woman,but I grew up with trucks,I learned to drive with a truck,and basically like the surprised looks I get at dealerships in this area when I walk in and ask to test drive a truck,and try to make a good deal on the price.The GMC trucks are a bit over priced for what you are getting,especially when you can get a Chevy with the same options and maker for a few thousand dollars less.
