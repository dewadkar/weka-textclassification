            In august of 1996 I traded in my 1994 Pontiac Grand Am and bought a new Pontiac Grand Prix.  As of today I have owned it for 40 months and I could not be happier.  I have never had a single problem - that's no breakdowns or repairs.  It seems the more miles I put on it, the better it runs.  After 51,000 miles, there are no rattles, and the ride is as good as the day I took it home.  When the warranty was up I checked into trading for the 1999 model Grand Prix, but decided to keep my 96 because they would only allow about 10,000 on trade.  The newer model featured a redesigned exterior, but the ride and interior was not any better than my 96,so I decided to keep her.  Now 4 months later, i'm pleased with my decision.  I will probably pass it down to my son.  In 1997 I bought my wife the redesigned Toyota Camry, it was 4000 dollars more than the Pontiac.  The car has not had any problems but it has depreciated faster than the Pontiac, and the seats hurt my back after an hour so we don't use it for trips.  Also considering Toyota's reputation I believe the General Motors product to be just as well made. After I pay for my 96 Pontiac, my next new car will likely be the Cadillac Eldorado.  I am very pleased with the quality of General Motors vehicles.
