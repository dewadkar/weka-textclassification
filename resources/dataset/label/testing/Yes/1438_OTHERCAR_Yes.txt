            We picked up a '94 Previa a little over a year ago.  Since our family was growing, we needed a bigger vehicle.  And since there was no epinions we looked through Consumer Reports and decided to check out this vehicle, which was highly rated for a used car.

We ended up with a vehicle that was a little bit higher end than anticipated:  Leather interior, CD audio, Anti-lock brakes, &amp; LE nameplate.  And lots of room.  The rear seats fold up and out of the way for roomy storage, but not quite big enough for a 4x8 piece of plywood to fit in. (Trust me, I tried).  The middle seats swivel and fold down, so it is roomier inside than it looks.  It seats seven adults, although the three sitting in the back have to be really close friends.  All the seats have shoulder and lap belts (except the middle back) and the middle two seats also have single lap belts (to make it easier to put in car seats?) that lock when pulled out.  Plus, on the back seats there are little hooks, so you can hang the up the plastic grocery bags; this prevents your stuff from falling out of the bags and under the seats during the ride home!

The engine, although &quot;super charged&quot; is a little on the light side.  It whines when you goose it, but once you reach cruising speed it quiets down nicely.  You can reach the vital fluids easily from the front, but the engine is hidden under the driver's seat.

The air conditioning is very cold; it features another fan/outlet for the rear passengers that is quite noisy when used.  It also offers a rear heating option.  

There are LOTS of cup holders.  Way cool.

Some lessons learned:  when your 4 year old wants to &quot;drive,&quot; be careful he doesn't break off the little wands on the steering column...I guess they weren't kid tested back in Japan.  Or else their kids know more about driving than mine do.  Anyway, it is expensive to replace!  Also, leather interiors can get really hot in the sun.  I don't know how the cows stand it!  They are easy to clean (just hose them off).  The seats are easy to clean, too.

I'm about 6', so the front seats are a little short.  There are vast vistas for people 5'10&quot; and under.  For me, they aren't so vast.  But there is a lot more window than I've been used to w/big side mirrors, so I feel that I have a commanding view of the surrounding environment.

That's about it.  It's a great mini-van.  <br><br>
