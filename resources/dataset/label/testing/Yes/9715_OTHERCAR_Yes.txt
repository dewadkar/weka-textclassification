            We bought our G20 over 2 years off eBay (if you can believe that) for $3000 under KBB value.   It has power windows, door locks, sunroof, cruise control, leather seats, tinted windows, gold trim just about all the bells and whistles, a real stylish looking vehicle.  

The only major problem we faced was that it wore out tires in the front once each year.  We took it to the dealership and they told us to replace this and that (expensive), but my husband did his own research and we ended up getting new struts and an alignment and that so far has fixed the problem.  ---  The only other thing I can think of is the original speakers finally blew out in front recently.   I do not consider replacing struts or speakers on a 10 year old car a significant problem.    

Parts are pretty easy to come by and the car is pretty easy for a do-it-your selfer to keep up with.  We were side-swiped recently and my husband easily swapped guts from a &#145junker' electric mirror and put it in ours to reattach the it.  The auto shop wanted to charge us well over $250 for parts and labor but my husband did it for $45.  

It is roomy enough for our family and the occasional outside passenger.  The back seat fits our two girl's booster seats (with the girls in them) and another passenger semi-snugly.  Lots of room in the trunk!  That I like!   Seats are firm and comfortable.  I have a bad back and I have no complaints at all.  It even has a lumber support option.

The car handles well, is comfortable for long drives and has quite a punch in the engine for pulling out into tight spots in traffic.  Gas mileage is good, about 320 miles to a full tank.  Always starts with no problem both on hot and cold days.

We get many compliments on this car (especially when it is clean).   Our experience with this car has definitely impressed upon our minds the Infiniti line of cars and we would definitely consider another model in the future.
