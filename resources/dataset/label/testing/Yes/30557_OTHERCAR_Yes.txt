            We looked at a variety of SUVs before settling on a 2004 Honda Pilot, which is the best value in mid-sized SUVs. We also loved the Sequoia, but to get one comparably equipped, it would have been another $15,000 or so. The Yukon was too big, too cushy and I was worried about reliability. The Highlander doesn't have a 3rd row seat and is the most bland looking of the Toyotas. We wanted a big SUV but wanted to pay for a mid-size. We got that with the Pilot. We have the EX-L with DVD. While Honda has always made a great car, I've always categorized Hondas as sort of bland. This SUV drives like a luxury SUV. Its exterior looks may not blow you away, but inside, it is ergonomically correct and beautiful. 2004 models added heated seats up front which are nice to have.

The car is a pleasure to drive. It has plenty of power without seeming like an irresponsible amount (like a Yukon)and its smooth, not trucky. The visibility is unparrelled both front and back. The comfort of the vehicle is very noticeable, too. We owned a Mercedes ML320 for years (junk) and the Pilot is far more comfortable. Finally, having a young child, the DVD system is a God-send!

I would highly recommend this car and give it a grade A. Its not perfect (as listed in cons), but I couldn't find anything better. The only pet peave is the lack of keyless entry. Who doesn't offer keyless entry these days???!!??
