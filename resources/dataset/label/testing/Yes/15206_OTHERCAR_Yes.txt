            I bought the 2000 Toyota Sienna because of three main reasons.
1) It got amazing reviews for front, side, and rear collisions
2) It is not too big, and not too small
3) It's price.
This van is a great family car.  It has just enough room for all your kids and pets.  I owned a Dodge Caravan and it was so big, it felt like i was driving a truck.  After I got the Sienna i felt a great difference.  The Sienna's ride is great.  It has quite a nice pick up for a van. And the breaks are a lot better than the Caravan.

The only bad thing that I can say about the Sienna, is it's turning ability.  It  really doesn't handle tight turns well at all.<br><br>
