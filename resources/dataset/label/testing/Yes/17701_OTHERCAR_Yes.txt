            Under normal circumstances, I'm not one of those people who are in love with material items. But I have to say that I have finally found my love match. Ironically, it's a dark green '95 used Saturn.

From the moment I laid eyes on her, I knew I wanted her. (Being a girl myself, this is an odd thing to write.) She didn't cost much, she was an automatic, beautifully designed in every way, and just plain out my dream car. As a 17 year old, this was going to be my first car and I knew we'd be together for quite sometime. But I was positive this is the one i wanted out of all the other car places I'd visited that day. 

I don't regret getting the car who came to be known as Mean Green Mysterio. I love to drive her everywhere, she handles curves well and adjusts to terrain easily. The only complaint I have would be that sometimes, Mean Green doesn't get up to speed like she should, but this is a personal car problem. She just plain needs fixed in that sense. Other than that, we cruise down the road together in style. Her sleek design makes her a perfect car for man and woman, both young and old. 

I'd recommend this car to anyone! I'm not a car dealer or anything, I'm just a regular 17 year old girl from WV. Who is in live...ummm....with her car?<br><br>
