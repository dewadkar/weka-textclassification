            I own a Saab 900 hatchback; it now has 178,000 miles on it and is running strong.  I have been traveling around the country for over five months and the car is running strong.  I have has this one now for four years and have put little money into it.  The engine is solid, a plus is that you can replace the brush assembly in the alternator, a large $$ saver.  I have been through many harsh winters where many SUV's are stuck and pulled over while the Saab and I have blow right through the snow and ice.  I find it runs great in the snow with nokian tires.  I think that the Saab is an excellent car for teens and families, it has a high safety record and is a very solid car to drive.  With out turbo it can be a little slow, which is good for the teen driver.  I like to drive this car because it is a smooth comfortable and even drive.  Even with its age I still am getting close to 30 mpg on even terran.  More like 26 mpg if it is hilly.  In the city the mileage goes way down to about 20 mpg.  People who live in very hot climates should not own this car.  It is more of a winter vehicle. The engine can run very hot in hot climates.  Over all I definitely think that the Saab is an excellent car to own, it can be expensive to fix but does not need repair often.  They run very well into the high mileage, 200k+.  One must be careful though because the transmission is in the front of the engine and can be damaged due to low clearance.  There is a skid plate but once the transmission is damaged it can run well over a thousand dollars to fix.  On the topic of transmissions, I have experienced better transmission life with the manual five speed over the automatic transmission.<br><br>
