            I was already a big fan of the Fuji line, having bought a MX-1700 for my parents.  

But when I went shopping for a new camera, I wanted something a little lower cost that I could tote around on my travels and not worry about a $400-500+ digital camera being banged around or stolen.

The Fuji FinePix 1400 was perfect for my needs.  It has a compact chassis with a built in lens cover which makes it ideal for travelling.  Battery life is decent (I recently took 150 pictures on 4 AA's).

And image quality is terrific.  I highly recommend that people check out the sample images at www.imaging-resource.com.

And the 3x optical zoom is a real bonus as most cameras in this price range are still limited to the &quot;digital&quot; zooms only.  The FinePix 1400 also has a 2x digital zoom.

There are 6 different photo quality modes, from 640x480, high compression to 1280x1024 low compression.  You can get over 150 low-res pictures and around 45 high-res pictures on a reusable 16 MB card (around $30 now).

Pros:
* Great lightweight chassis with built in lens cover.
* Great price (10/10/00: can be had for $245 US, try www.shopper.com)
* Great quality pictures 
* 3x Optical Zoom 

Cons:
* Comes with a tiny 4 MB SmartMedia card.  This is absolutely criminal on Fuji's part.  It could detract new buyers who don't realize that they can go buy a 16 MB card for $30 at www.buy.com.
* Display screen is 1.6&quot;, which is smaller than average for 1.3 megapixel cameras.  It is also difficult to see in bright light
* No video out (show on TV).  Another silly design decision by Fuji.  I never thought about it when I bought it, but it's a nice feature on most cameras.
