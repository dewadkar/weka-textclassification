            When I first heard of the Olympus C-2100UZ, I knew this was the digicam for me. I've owned several Olympus digicams and like all the others, this one continues to impress.
 
First off, you get a huge 10x zoom lens that is electronically stabilized. This combination produces super sharp images at any focal length. Furthermore, the stabilization greatly enhances chances of taking sharp hand-held images at slow shutter speeds (I've taken reasonably sharp handheld photos at 1/10s and believe me, I do not have steady hands).
 
Another fairly unique feature is the electronic viewfinder - that is, inside the eye-piece is a small LCD, much like on camcorders. This is both good and bad. The good news is that you're looking through the lens and see a lot of useful info while taking photos. However, the refresh rate is somewhat sluggish and in very dark conditions, it's not very usable (as opposed to regular optical viewfinder). The refresh rate problem can be solved by using the 1.8" LCD screen as a viewfinder - its refresh is much better but it eats batteries.
 
The camera can be used in fully automatic or fully manual mode, with everything in between. I am not going to describe the features - you can visit Olympus website or many digicam websites to get this info. In short, the Oly C-2100UZ has virtually all the features one would need. It even has a very decent movie mode, which captures up to ~30s of video with sound at 320x240 @ 15 fps. All these features are quite easy to figure out and use, especially if you read the decently well-written and detailed user manual.
 
In the end, all that matters is image quality. This is where this camera excels. This is, quite possibly, the best 2-megapixel digicam out there. It produces sharp, colorful, well exposed and balanced images under virtually any condition. The images contain very little or no noise (until you hit the higher ISO values, that is). In addition, it has a fairly big buffer which means you can snap away almost like with regular film camera. In fact, I would rate the overall speed and responsiveness of the Olympus C-2100UZ as mostly excellent. Also, while the camera is fairly large, it is very easy to hold and all its controls are well laid out.
 
Bottom line: Nothing is perfect but the Olympus C-2100UZ comes pretty close. It's not the best, highest resolution, or cheapest digicam but when you consider all its aspects, you will find an almost unbeatable combination of features and quality. As of right now (2/01), it sells for about $650 at some Internet shops and while there are 3-megapixel cameras in that price range, you will not go wrong with the C-2100UZ. Highly recommended.
