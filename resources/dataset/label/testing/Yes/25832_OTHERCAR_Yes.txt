            The 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport is a smoother, quieter ride than in years past.  The seats are high back and much more comfortable than the old bucket seats of 10 years ago.  The sport still keeps the older boxier style of body, as opposed to rounded Grand Cherokees.  The Inline 6 4.0L is still probably the best engine on the market.  The back seat is a little tight for taller people, but the drivers seat is roomy enough for me (6'3&quot;, 220 pounds).  Driving the new Sport is very nice, the suspension here is better than that just a few years ago.  You can even add a full size spare as an option, however it does come standard with the Select-Trac four wheel drive system.  The Select-Trac System features full-time four wheel drive, where the Command-Trac does not.  It is definitely worth the extra $500 or so as an add-on.  The Sport is probably the best Jeep Cherokee to go 'play' in.  If you are not planning on 'playing' in adverse conditions then I would recommend the two wheel drive option.  <br><br>
