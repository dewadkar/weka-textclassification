                  This thing is <b>blue</b> and I <i>LOVE</i> it. I was looking for a good but cheep digital camers. There were a few things I wanted, an LCD screen as well as am optical view finder, and removalble memory and I was led (By AOHell) to the AGFA EPhoto 780C. I decited &quot;What the heck&quot; and ordered it, here are my impressions.

<b>Pros</b>
   
<b>*</b>ITs <b>Blue</b>!

I thought, &quot;A blue camera?!?&quot; But it is fun to have a blue camera, makes it super easy to identify as mine!&quot;
    
<b>*</b>So so pictures

While I wouldn't expect a pro taking pictures for a magazine to use this the photos are good enough for me. Mabey some day when I have more money I will buy a better camera. 

    <b>*</b>2 View finders

This has both a LCD and Optical view finder, so you can conserve batteries by using the optical view finder, but still go through and see your photos.

    <b>*</b>Easy to use

This thing couldn't be <b>ANY</b> easier to use. It operates almost just like a normal camera.


<b>CONS</b>

       <b>*</b>Eats batteries for breakfast

If you want this camera make sure you buy some high capacity rechargable batteries to go with it, you'll need them.

       <b>*</b>Plan on spending more then you thought

This camera doesn't stop at $299. You'll be buying batters more than you expected and if you plan on taking more then a couple decent photos plan on buying more memory, although it will only accept memory cards up to 8Mb. Also if you want your photos on your computer anytime soon you will probably end up buying a Digital Film reader, the searial port methood is 
<b>SLOW!</b>

      <b>*</b>Not extremly high res

Although it takes nice photos for your computer and for small, standard size prints don't expect megapixel performance.
