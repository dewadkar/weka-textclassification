            This camera is very nifty. It has everything needed to take great snapshots.  It has lots of different built-in features. Some of these include: three different picture qualities, red-eye reduction, auto-flash, 1X and 2X zoom, self-timer, auto-focus, date displayer, welcome screen, and it also comes with a 4MB memory chip.  Along with the camera comes Hewlett Packard Photosmart software that allows you to save all of your photos onto your computer.  This camera also has the option of having a video screen to show you what you are taking a picture of.  This camera is very good for under two-hundred dollars<br><br>
