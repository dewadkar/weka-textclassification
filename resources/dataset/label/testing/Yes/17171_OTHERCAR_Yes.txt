            OH, it's you BOB. Was once a slogan for Nissans commercials for the Maxima, highly laughed at where I went to college was this ad.
The years passed and I thought nothing of the Maxima.
UNTIL, a friend of mine came out to visit me from wisconsin, She rented a Maxima, it was 3 years ago, so must have been a 1997, this car had a great stereo, roomy in front and back, and was so quiet. Even at high speeds, there was little wind noise and vibration. 
We liked the car, and of course the 160mph speedometer stood out. Thinking, NO WAY can this car go that fast, we went to a really long straight stretch of road that leads to a beach. I know what you're saying, how irresponsible to do this near a beach- it was february. NO ONE goes to the beach in MA in february, it's just to cold.
SO the test began. Faster and faster we went, the acceleration really was great up to about 100, at that point it lessened, it went steady from there on in, slowly climbing until we had the speedometer needle past the 140mph mark. Not much past it, but we topped it.
This car accelerated to 100 QUICK, not like the corvettes or z28ss camaro or firebird ram air. But for a family style car, this thing MOVES!
As for the handling- where do you want to throw it ? It laughs at turns.
Aside from me thinking it has no style and very boring looking, this is a great fast car.<br><br>
