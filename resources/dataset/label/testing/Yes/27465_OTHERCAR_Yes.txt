            <b>Oh No!</b>

If there are those of you who would like to take the time to look through my reviews, you'll find that I have another review on the Sable. The one thing I'd like to say in my defense of writing another review, and not deleting that one is this: <i>(okay perhaps a few things)</i>

- I wrote the review after driving my friends' Sable for a considerable amount of time. I now have purchased my OWN Sable and know a great deal more about the car.

- The vehicles mentioned have two different size engines, so even though the cars LOOK the same, they're not and I can comment on those differences now.

- In much the same way, one car has many more miles than the other ... another good basis for comparison.

- I made many good points, I feel, in my other review ... I'm not trying to rehash, or restate those points, but to add more information. It seemed better to write a new review to compliment the other, rather than to make the other one so extremely long it was &quot;bulky&quot;.

With all that said .. here's my new review.

<b>A Tale Of Two Sables Or<i> Ode To Two Sables</i></b>

Enter the blue/green Sable. It's stately manor, it's formal lines, it's pristine looks ... all is grand and sheer elegance!

Yet what power looks underneath this metal flesh ?  Unfaltered by it's 120,000 mile quest, there lies, deep within the bowels a 3.8L heart.

Beware! For even now, as the 3.8L rests, the silent night reveals <i>The Shadow</i> with it's gentle 3.0L innards. A cranberry skinned beast which creeps through the darkened edges of twilight. Fresh into this world at only 60,000 of life!

Startled, though by broken twig or disturbed stone we know not, the more mature Sable, sprints off to escape.  Quickly, never pushing it's limits past 2,500 RPM's, the green creature flees, racing away into the distance.

Undaunted, it's reddish, blemish free skin glistening in the moonlight, the 3.0L takes to the chase.  There seems no chance of recovering the advantage. From the beginning, it's insides growl at an incideous 3,800+ RPM's as it struggles to make up for lost time ... Then as it reaches the 65MPH mark, it suddenly settles to a more subtle hum ... comfortably moving at 2,200 RPM's.

With equal rest and equal nourishment, the chase continues until the day become new.  Slowly the older of the two slows, the sputters into submission, as the newer, and less powerful overtakes it.  

<b>Okay John, What Does It Mean?</b>

In a nut shell, The 3.8L engine runs great, has more power for pick up, and won't race as much when you hit the gas pedal hard.  I find myself a keeping an eye on the RPM's when I pass someone or when I push to a quick pick-up while driving my 3.0L Sable. What's the advantage? The 3.0L seem to get 3 to 5 miles more per gallon that the larger engine. And when cruising, the engine only runs about 250RPM's faster than the 3.8L.

<b>Coincidence, or Automotive Virus?</b>

<i>Saturday, June 10th 2000</i>

The green sable with 120,000+ miles on it decided it was going to rid itself of that pesky little thing known as the &quot;water pump&quot;. Gleefully grinding and squeeling it's way ... it finally made it home, where it still sits, four days later. At an average cost of $35.00 for a rebuilt pump, It's sure to be a wonderful time for all involved replacing it.

<i>Monday, June 12th 2000</i>

Is that <i>The Shadow</i> talking? Why of course not, cars can't talk ... perhaps it ate something bad, I can hear it's stomach grumbling! Nah, at just a little over 63,000 miles, it's the water pump giving out!  

With just 73 miles left in the warranty period, <i>The Shadow</i> has been to the doctors office and returned, free of charge, and no more grumbling tummy. If this is contagious though, should I still be leaving <i>The Shadow</i> so close to the green Sable ??!!

<b>Let's Pack It Up Folks!</b>

The green Sable is empty. The trunk holds little more than air. Then there's <i>The Shadow</i>. In it's trunk lies four large rubbermaid bins filled with everything from clothes to videos to CD's. Along with a large box filled with more clothes, a <i>Sony</i> boombox, rollerblades, 5 pairs of shoes/sneakers and whatever else can be jammed into it.

Even with this, <i>The Shadow</i> only sits an inch lower in the posterior than the green Sable.

<b>First Impressions</b>

At 120,000+ miles, the green Sables' finish and appearance is arguably in as good of shape as <i>The Shadows'</i> 63,000 mile hide. The only blemishes coming from pesky humans with keys and other objects seemingly looking for vengeance for some unknown wrong done to them.

<b>Maintaining A Good Relationship</b>

Well, If it were time to change the spark plugs, the little 3.0L engine isn't a very big deal ... yet when it comes to the 3.8L, you'd be hard pressed to even locate where 2 of the 6 plugs are. It seems that &quot;.8&quot; takes up much more room in the engine compartment than you would think.

As for things such as the water pump, they're both equally troublesome to access, located halfway down in the middle of a half dozen other pulleys, jammed up tight between the engine and two large coolant reservoirs.

<b>Twin Troubles</b>

The chassis has it's own problems ... it looks great, yet trying to get to some of the marker and turning lights, as well as the brake lights isn't always easy, involving three or even four steps, as compared to just one or two.

Topping of the gas tank is also always loads of fun. When that pump shuts itself off, expect to be able to squeeze AT LEAST another entire gallon of fluid into it! Is this the filler tube, or just some odd twist at the top of the tank. Who really knows, it's annoying either way.

<b>In Closing</b>

Is this just some strange twist of fate that the water pumps on both cars went at the same time ??? * shrug * who can say ...

Overall, I am still very pleased with both Sables, yet sometimes I'd rather have someone else do the maintenance on them!
