            This is an excellent camera for the beginner as well as the expert. It is very easy to operate. Shoot review and load into your computer and print out any or all the shots you want. The discs I have holds up to 45 pictures and you never run out of film and it is always ready to go. You can delete from the camera the pictures you don't want and save the ones you do. You actually see the pictures you are taking as if it were a camcorder. It has many other features such as taking a photo in black or white, solar, and negative art. The camera also has light adjustments and playback features. Although it was a bit pricey it does come with a battery charger, battery and one disc to get you started.It also comes with software to use with the pictures as well. I feel you get what you pay for and in this case it was worth it. My camera is always loaded and ready to go.<br><br>
