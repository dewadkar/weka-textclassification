            We fell in love with the look of the Dodge truck.We really went 
back and forth between the Chevy Silverado and the Dodge,but we
were sold on a used 1998 red Dodge 4x4 that had all the options.
We are concerned about one thing about the truck that does not seem
to go away, and that is the smell of hot antifreeze after the truck
has been driven a bit. I have had it in the shop for a gasket 
replace but I can still smell it...I would like to know if anyone
else has experienced this?? Besides the smell I am concerned about 
some of the complaints I read here and am strongly considering an
extended warranty.<br><br>
