            Since many of the reviews here are very well done and give excellent detail of the car I decided to do a direct-comparison approach to another excellent vehicle... The BMW 330ci.... I know it&#146s not a 2 seater (but is a coupe) but the 330ci is an excellent car to use as the mark for excellence for anything (performance oriented) built by anyone under the 40k price.... I hope my review will not make you decide what to purchase but rather help you decide based on a comparison basis to a world-class car brand.... BMW

I just spent some time behind the wheel of this VERY FUN vehicle and have a review I would like to share. I currently lease a BMW E46 (323ci) and a close friend owns a E46 (330ci) so my review will be heavily compared to the BMW 3 series. I have also spent a great deal behind the wheel of a new Mustang GT but still do not like the handling of the nose heavy and straight rear axel of the fast pony but it should still be considered for people that love going fast in a straight line. Of course the 2005 Mustang with new chassis, independent rear axel and new engine should be a major improvement from Ford. I would also say if you can wait another year the new Mustang may be the new king of the streets for its price range.

Now&#133 My opinion. The new 350Z is one nice looking car and will make you get many looks as you pass people. As for handling it will beat anything under the 30k price range. I would not even think of comparing a true rear wheel sports car to ANY front wheel drive car at ANY price&#133. (on dry pavement). All front wheel cars suffer from poor balancing and can&#146t ever compete&#133 at least not yet! 

As for its engine performance the car is very fast and probably can only be beaten by a Mustang GT in the under 30k price tag. But take a few turns and the Mustang will only see your tail lights. 

As for Ergonomics&#133.. this is where the 350Z really disappoints me. This is also why I will tell you guys why you should also HEAVILY consider a new BMW E46 since the 325ci is about the same price and the 330ci is about 3k more then the top model 350Z (with premium sound and sports package on the BMW). Anyway, the 350Z has doors so high you will not be relaxing on a nice summer day with the arm out the window and give you a very claustrophobic feeling. The rear view is SO HORRIBLE that you will not see the windshield of the car behind you if he is more then 50ft away&#133. It will take getting use to. The center console has no arm rest for those that shift in heavy traffic and this will cause fatigue. 

I have decided to stick with BMW and will tell you all that YOU SHOULD DRIVE a 330ci BEFORE buying a 350Z!!! The 330ci is nearly as fast even though it hast about 50 less HP and will handle as well as the 350Z on any track or any road in my opinion (and a MUCH better ride to boot). PLUS the BMW will be FAR more comfortable, has a FAR better interior, the HK sound system blows away the Bose, has WAY more cargo space, a back seat, less blind behind you, feels better balanced, has better steering (350Z is too light), the breaks on the 330ci are huge and work well (although the Brembo&#146s on the 350Z are nice). Many more things can be considered but you should find out by yourself by driving the BMW and the 350Z. I know other will say you can buy the 350Z for much less with the lesser models and save considerably over the BMW but the BMW comes standard with features that will only come in the better 350Z models&#133 such as stability control and huge breaks. Plus BMW&#146s are much more configurable as far as options go&#133 you only pay for what you need! Typical of Japanese companies you MUST have some features to get others and I always hated this&#133. Packages suck! 

note: If you need is a weekend fun car that will punish many cars on the road today with a combination of speed and handling the 350Z wins hands down with pure FUN factor. Since it does feel &#147sportier&#148 then the BMW. But if you desire to take long trips, carry luggage, take extra passengers and like having the prestige of owning the BMW name then drive one and see for yourself how awesome the &#147Ultimate Driving Machine&#148 really is&#133.. 

Also I did not forget Corvette&#133&#133 it&#146s a 350Z with more &#147balls&#148&#133.. if you want to pay 8-10k more. I can&#146t recommend the BMW M3 due to its nearly 50k price&#133. 

Also the BMW I6 and the Nissan V6 are both considered the best 6cyl engines in the world and both are extremely reliable&#133. With the BMW feeling smoother through the RPM range but not by much&#133&#133. 

Enjoy your test drives and if the 350Z&#146s shortcoming don&#146t bother you its one AWSOME deal for the price (based on pure performance ability). Hands down!!!!!! 

If you think your front wheel drive car handles well then you have never driven a real rear wheel drive independent suspension sports car and will be blown away by how much better it will feel compared to the front heavy front drive cars most kids tend to like these days.

ALSO: DO NOT get the model lesser then the Performance model if you plan to drive in rain or snow... YOU WANT stability control..... for safety. I feel very strongly about this after having this feature for the last 3 years....  for dry performance you may want to turn it off if you are a skilled driver.

OK... one more thing:   Nissan should put adjustable struts in this car in future models... or get a nice set of after-markets.

I think I am done now....   :)

A note about the dealership I went to. Atlantic Auto Mall on Long Island.... Loved my experience with them! Much better then the arrogance you will get from most BMW dealers. BMW's are not easy to buy below sticker price and this may turn off some people.
