            The early '96 models were built on the K-car frame and later ones on the Cirrus frame.  Mine is more stable, dependable and easier to handle.  It is a keeper as one of the first 500 made and everything was standard equipment on the JXi with only the trunk mounted CD changer optional.  It has a large trunk that holds luggage and 2 sets of golf clubs and the back seat hold 2 250 lb.+ teenagers with plenty of foot and head room!  The brake pads are undersized and need replacing more frequently but they are larger on the new models.  Some idiot put a &quot;flip&quot; rearview mirror in the car so you can view the stars and streetlights at night...that too was corrected.  I was one of the customers who lost the bonnet to the folded top on the freeway 2 years ago...they fixed that too.  What is REALLY needed if Chrysler wants to sell the Sebring JXi in the sports convertible class is a larger engine with a fully standard trans, not the cretin-o-matic toy they came up with!  This car has been a dream to own and operate otherwise here in Michigan's unpredictable weather and it is SAFER to drive in hazardous weather because of the low center of gravity and wider heavier frame.  I laugh when the macho jerks in their SUV's (we call them suburban assault vehicles) flip, slide and spin out of control under conditions where I glide and float safely!  Having owned and driven everything from a minivan to an E Class, I definitely prefer my Sebring!  Even my 4 boys prefer the year-round adaptability of MY car over their cars, trucks, minivans and &quot;other&quot; sports cars!  A true family fun car that can handle anything.  It also save thousands of $$ in therapy costs since you chemically recharge your psyche when the top is down.  The rushing freedom of the air blows those negative ions right out of your system!  The leather is easy to clean and I've even driven in the rain with carefree abandon!  The aerodynamics keep you dry!  This is the first car I have ever kept over 3 years!  I will replace it when they put the manual trans and bigger engine in it!<br><br>
