            The Sony Mavica line of digital cameras are just awesome. I was looking for a digital camera that could take quick, detailed pictures with no effort whatsoever, and I've found what I was looking for in the Sony MVC-FD90. Unlike the earlier versions of digital cameras that require additional software that takes up precious space on your hardrive and extra hardware that takes up precious space in your house, the Sony MVC-FD90 doesn't require either of those. It simply takes the picture and stores it on a standard 3.5&quot; hard disk that is pre-formatted for any computer to use. The Sony MVC-FD90 easy to understand and use for everyone from the novice to the experienced picture-taker. Priced a little bit higher than the standard digital camera, but well worth the extra cash, the Sony MVC-FD90 is one of the best.<br><br>
