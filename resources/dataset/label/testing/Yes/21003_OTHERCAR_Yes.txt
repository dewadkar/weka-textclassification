              Last year my wife and I went shopping for a new car that was big enough for us and our baby but small enough for city life. We decide on the RAV4 for its options and durability. The RAV4 has exceptional power for its small engine and good gas mileage to go along with it. A broad range of options for the interior, finishes the bill. My wife decided on a black, four door, with leather seats, cd player, towing package and all the other perks she could get in it. The final bill was a little over $21,000. At first we liked the vehicle but after a few months we ran into several problems. First the CD player quit working and had to be replaced, then the alarm system and remote locks quit working and worked on their own schedule. Second the ride performance started to get horrible, it started to feel like we were riding a log with wheels. You could feel the smallest bump that you drove over. Lastly the engine performance and gas mileage started to fall to the way side also. The engine began to lose its pep and we'd only get about 150 to 180 miles out of a full tank compared to an original 220 to 250 miles. After some other minor problems we finally decided to trade our 99 Rav4 in for a new Chevy and now were spending more time on the road than in the shop getting stuff fixed.<br><br>
