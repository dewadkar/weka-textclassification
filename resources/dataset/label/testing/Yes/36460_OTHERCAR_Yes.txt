            I received a offer to testdrive the Nissan Altima and decided to take Nissan on its offer of sampling the new 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL.  This model is the fully loaded 2.5 4 cylinder 175 hp with the Bose system, leather, and automatic transmission.  

First off, the silhouette of this vehicle is gorgeous.  The front is aggressive with beautiful headlights and the rear is well executed with those cool rear lights that Gen X folks love.  This vehicle will attract attention.

The metal used by Nissan is cheap.  When you shut the door, the sound of thin cheap metal is heard.  Unlike the Maxima which uses high carbon steel, the Altima is built with normal steel.  This is noticeable when you slap the door sides with the palm of your hand or shut the trunk.  Also, the trunk uses hinges which unfortunately eat into the trunk space.  I wish the automotive makers would stop cutting corners and make cars with hydraulics hinges for the trunks so consumers can use the entire trunk space.

The 2.5 engine is an inline 4 cylinder and is slightly based on the VQ series which has won numerous awards from the leading automobile editors (see www.wardsauto.com).  The designs are similar, but the 2.5 is not quite a VQ engine.  The reliability should be comparable though as Nissan is known for designing reliable engines.  The engine is responsive and sounds pretty aggressive.  For normal city driving, the engine is more than sufficient, and for highway driving, the engine is sufficient, but a little on the loud side.  

On the suspension side, the setup is a hybrid version that Nissan uses on its world renown supercar Skyline.  As a result, the 2.5 SL corners well and accelerates fairly flat into corner and out of corners.  Also, the suspension is fully independent (unlike the Maxima's which is semi-independent) and as such, absorbs little and big potholes well.  This suspension can certainly rival the double wishbone suspensions used in the Accord (same suspensions are used in Formula F1 racecars) and surpasses the strut used in the Camry (boring), plus the Altima is far more interesting in aggressive driving situations.

The inside is very well designed.  The layout is fairly intuitive.  The front windows are auto down and auto up.  In my humble opinion, the auto up function should be required of all auto windows.  The only issue is the quality of the plastic, buttons, dash, and overall quality which is not competitive when compared to the Accord or the Camry.  

On driving the Altima, the automatic transmission can be manually shifted through the various gates from 1st gear through 4th gear.  The shifts are smooth.  Similar to other front wheel drive vehicles, there is a bit of torque steer.  Torque steer occurs only in front wheel drive vehicles and occurs when the vehicle is accelerated and the steering wheel jerks to the right or left.  The Accord/Camry 4 cylinder models have minimal torque steer, but the Altima has more horsepower (175) and as such, has a little bit more torque steer.  

The sound system courtesy of Bose was good, but a little light on the bass.  The quality of the leather was normal, nothing spectacular.

Overall, the Altima SL is certainly competitive in terms of what you get as standard options.  However, to get the goodies (i.e. options, etc.), the price builds and becomes as expensive as the Accord 4 cylinders or the Camry 4 cylinders.  However, the tie-breakers are the engine which is more powerful, smoother, and the suspension which is very sporty for a family sedan.  Finally, there is some uncertainty as to the resale value.  The best bet is probably the 2.5 S without all the extra costs/gadgets associated with the 2.5 SL.  The 3.5 SE offers a V-6 which is a member of the VQ familty.  I can not comment on this model, but I suspect 240 hp on the front wheels probably create substantial torque steer.  Good luck on your decision.
