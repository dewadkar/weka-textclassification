            This car is a beauty.  You fall in love with it at first sight.  The look is sporty, but not too fancy.  The body, context, and characteristics makes this car a must have.  I bought a 2000 Accord V6 LX last June because my family needed a car.  We are very conservative and already own other models of Honda (1999 Civic LX and 1992 Accord (not sure what type)).  I always wanted a sporty car to well....pick up the girls.  But this car is so comfortable and such a delight to drive, it's amazing how a short drive to the store can end up for an hours drive around town for no particular reason.  

I paid invoice for this car and I guess it was all right.  I mean, I'd rather get this car a little cheaper, but hey, it will have to do.  I love taking this car where ever I go.  I hate parking near other cars because I'm afraid of dents and scratches.  This isn't a luxury car by any means, but I take care of it as if it was.  The engine is so soft, you don't even notice that you have the car running.  It's strange but true.  I'm not a fanatic for domestics as you can see.  I prefer my cars to be quiet and comfortable, but very powerful.  

With the V6 engine, you can keep up with other cars without any problems (not saying that I do, hehe)  Driving this car is very fun and exciting.  The stock stereo system is durable and can with stand the loud music a teenager plays and still be able to not get scratchy when my folks drive to listen to the news.  I would have to say that my only problem with this car is that when you get scratches and dents, it is very noticeable on a black car.  Not saying, you shouldn't buy black, but it will cause a lot of heart ache and pain if you really care about your car.  I know first hand.  

Other than that, the car is really great.  I have minor issues with the window seal being loose and the door giving minor problems.  I would have to say this car has been great.  Oh yeah, well the mileage is a tad off.  I'm guessing not many people these days drives around 65 mph.  Now, let's be realistic, people often drive 70 - 75 plus, and that's on a slow day.  Everyone is in a hurry to get no where.  I, myself, am no different.  The mileage you get out of the car is roughly about 15 local and 18 on the freeway.  That's how much I get commuting to and from school which is about 25 miles away from my house.  I think this car is fit for anyone to drive.  It can be good as a commuter car or it can be used as a leisure car.  In any case, this car is great in my book.  Just figure out what you want compared to what you don't want.  Pros and cons.  This car definitely has more pros than cons.  <br><br>
