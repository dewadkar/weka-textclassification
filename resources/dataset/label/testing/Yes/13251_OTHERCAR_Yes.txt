            The Honda Accord is the best car on the road for those of you that don't have more than three children.

This is my third Accord!  I've owned a 4 door 1985 Charcoal Grey Accord, which I sold it 1993 for $3200 with 110K miles. I just sold my second Accord, a 1991 2 door green one for $4300 with 145K miles. I now own my first branch new Accord - a 1999 4 door black current V6 EX , with all amenities. This is the greatest car, it just purrs as you drive! I love to drive these cars!

Not only do they feel extremely smooth when driving, they are very safe and secure cars. I put no extra money into any of my three accords beyond the normal maintenace as prescribed by Honda in the owner's manual. This car is the perfect example of what you put into it is what you receive in return. As you can tell by the amazing value that these cars have held, as long as you maintain their upkeep, you will have no problems in either the eventual sale or worrying about money being thrown away into a lemon.

I believe that the cost is econcomical - ranging roughly from 23K to 36K.

Good luck in your car hunting.<br><br>
