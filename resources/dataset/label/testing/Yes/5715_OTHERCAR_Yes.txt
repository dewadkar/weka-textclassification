            I received the Ricoh-4300 as a gift close to a year ago, and quite honestly, this camera has caused me nothing but problems from the very beginning.

At first, I was pleased to see the large LCD screen on the back of the unit. I loved the fact that I could view my pictures instantly, and that the image was so crystal clear.

However, I would say that the screen was the only positive feature of the camera. If I may list its faults one by one:

1.) There is no viewfinder. This means that what you see on the screen is not always what you get. Plus, the lack of a viewfinder makes it difficult to see clearly when you take the unit outside; the glare on the screen makes it virtually impossible to snap pictures in the bright sunlight, even when you modify screen contrast.

2.) The camera is atrociously slow. It is slow taking pictures, slow zooming, and slow downloading pics to your PC.

3.) The batteries will last a half-hour if you are LUCKY. I had the frustration of bringing the camera to Europe with me, and not having the proper recharging equipment, I had to constantly buy new batteries... which never lasted long enough to let me take pics while I was sightseeing for a few hours.

4.) Made of flimsy material. I dropped it from waist level and it dented.

5.) Taking pictures of the distance often came out blurry.

6.) Colors were often distorted in artificial light. Either too red or too yellow.

For a rather expensive camera, this one is a bomb. There are better options on the market, and I recommend consumers to thoroughly research the camera before they invest in such a thing. I am quite disappointed with this machine.<br><br>
