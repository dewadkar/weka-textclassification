            I have always driven very small cars. At five feet tall, A smaller vehicle gave me a sense of control.  The problem was, small cars are terrible in bad weather.  Even when the roads are just damp, you slip and slide.  I hated that feeling of helplessness, not knowing if the car would regain traction.  I wanted a four wheel drive vehicle, but I was intimidated by the size of them. (AND THE PRICE!)  Then I saw a commercial for the Sportage.  I convinced my husband to look into it.  
Within our first twenty minutes at the dealership, I knew I was going home with one.  We have had our KIA for three months now, and we love it.  It handled great with the recent snowy and icy conditions. It is easy to drive, and looks good too!<br><br>
