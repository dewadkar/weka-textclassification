            <b>The updates located at bottom of review.  (Long term review)</b>

The 2000/2001 Nissan Sentra is finally redesigned!  It is no longer the econo-box like it's older generations.  While the older generations of Sentra SE and SE-Rs are powerful but under their boring sheetmetal, the new Sentras have a body that compliments it's performance.

The performance I am talking about is comming form a Sentra SE that I own.  You may want to read other epinions if you are interested in the XE or GXE trims.

Of course, looks can be objectional, no one can dismiss the fact that, for a Sentra - a name that strikes "econo", the new look is a welcomed change.

Inside, the interior is not what you'd expect from a $13.5k car.  It looks more suited in a mid-sized sedan.  Controls are easy to use and intuitive.  The 7-speaker 180 W system is actually made by Clarion, but it is definately not their best.  Bass is better than average thanks to a dedicated open-air sub-woofer located with the rear speakers, but when cranked up, the system distorts badly.  Thankfully, even though the head unit looks as if it is integrated to the center stack (which looks great), it is a normal DIN head unit, which allows for anyone install something more deserving.  An in-dash 6-CD changer is the only option, so for you with cassettes, you may want to get with the times.

But, of course, most people will but this not just because of these new features, as drivers already plunk down their hard-earned and well-budgeted cash on previous Sentras, and Civics.  These drivers already know about the sports-nature of this car! The sports-tuned suspension is definately there!  Compared to other trims, the SE has a stiffer suspension, which some may not like.  You can absolutely feel every bump and groove on the road.  Because of this, it handles very well with little body roll.  As for the powerhouse, this little go-getter sports a 2.0 liter, 145 bhp engine that puts out 136 lb-ft of torque.  And that you will feel when matted to the 5 speed do-it-yourself gearbox.  Shifts are usually precise after the break-in period.  Otherwise, miss shifts may occur when you are breaking in the synchros.  This little engine that could will definately throw you and your passengers to the back of the seats when driven hard!

And speaking of seats, despite the 8-way manually adjustable seat (driver side), the seats themselves lack lumbar support, which causes discomfort after a long drive.  Rear seating capabilities are typical of a sports compact - very little leg room, but still doable.

Trunk space is adeqate for a compact.  60/40 split rear seats gives you more cargo room.  There is one overlooked design flaw, though:  The passthru from the trunk to the cabin is relatively small.  Skis, anyone?

Although the car has a solid feel to it when you drive it off the lot, after 7000 miles, I did experience cabin noise - specifically, both front doors and the center stack.  It may be time for a few screws to be tightened.

Also, the car gives a false sense of straightness when parking.  After parking the vehicle straight flush with a wall or curb, it definately will surprise you once you step outside.  So becareful!  In fact, even with this knowledge, I still managed to side-swiped the rear end onto the side of my garage.  Ouch!

All in all, this car is a great value for those who wants it all for a limited budget.  A 4-speed automatic is optional for those who lives on busy streets, which still lets you feel the power of the little engine that could and would.  It is still alot of car for the money.  Tricked out with the Sports Package that includes 16" alloy wheels, fog lamps, a rear spoiler, the 7-speaker 180 W stereo, and add a power moon-roof to the mix, and I still left the dealer while leaving behind $17,300.  You can't get that with a Civic!

<b>UPDATED 08/15/2001</b>
With the odometer rolling into 11,000 miles, how is my Sentra doing?  Well, let's find out.

<b>Annoyances Found</b>
The squeaks and rattles are getting louder and more annoying.  Nissan dealerships are denying that the car is making any noise at all.  I guess the only fix is to tighten and/or pad certian parts.  Nissan says that will void the warrantee, though that isn't exactly true (search for laws on this on Google and other search engines).

<b>Defects</b>
Many people are experiencing problems left and right.  To find out what everyone is complaining about, head over to www.b15sentra.net and go to their public forum.  Some defects are listed here:

-Windshield wind noise at highway speeds (65 MPH+)
-Sqeaks and rattles from pillars, doors, windows, and door handles
-Sunroof switch getting "sticky" or not contacting relaibly (and loss of "one touch" feature
-Metal-grinding noises when above speeds of 90 MPH
-Front suspension bolts recall

I have experienced everything but the metal-grinding noise, since I'm a good boy and stay reasonably near the speed limit.  :)  However, when I heard of the problem, I drove at around 100 MPH to see if I would experience the same problem.  <i>Nothing.  </i>I posted a message to see how long they were driving at those speeds, as I did 2 minute bursts so I didn't "run" into any cops.  :)

As of now, the car is still rattling and sqeaking away.  Sounds are comming from almost all pillars and door handle trims.  The back door handles are the worse culprits, since they sit close to the driver's ears.

Even though I had the recall fix done to my car, the front end is squealling when doing certian turns (I believe tight U turns will cause this).  These are low speed turns, and the sound caused me concerns.

There are even complaints about gear engagements, as I have experienced as well.  3rd gear gets grinded sometime when you shift quickly, while 1st and R sometimes won't engage unless you keep trying.  Of course, if you force it, the gears will grind, even with your clutch fully depressed.

Issues like these marred the otherwise quick Sentra.  I wouldn't call this car nimble, though, as it does feel big...almost like a mid-sized sedan.

With the Sentra SE being with me for almost 9 months, average mileage stayed at 27 MPG ... no change from when it was brand new.  Worse mileage is 25 MPG, while the best is 31 MPG.  Mixed driving consistently gives me 27 MPG, which includes heavy traffic, and moderate starts (25 MPG is not bad for a lot of jack-rabit starts, though).
