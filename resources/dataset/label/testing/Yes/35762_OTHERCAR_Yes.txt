            The wife and I were looking at the Honda Accord 4 door, Nissan Altima, and the Volkswagen Pasat. We previously owned a 2000 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, and although it was a great truck....it rode like a truck.  So we went out to find a 4 door auto.  We drove the Nissan Altima, and the high end Maxima (sweet ride), but the Maxima at over $35,000 was out of our price range.  The Altima was nice but had a "sport suspension" which in my opinion was a little rough.
The Pasat was not to our liking either.  Next was Honda.  We drove the 2003 Honda LX (4 cylinder) with leather and sunroof, and automatic.  It was a nice ride, but the 4-cylinder engine sounds like every other 4 cylinder engine-a squirrel running in a cage.  On the around town drive, I gave it a run for it's money, with the wild eyed salesman in the back.  It's comforts are nice, but the engine in my opinion with the 4 cylinder when you have to floor-it, sounds like it's going to come through the hood.
We then drove the 6 Cylinder EX Automatic, with leather. I again did not want to waste money, and the 4 cylinder car would get us by for the time being, but the 6 Cylinder car would in the long run, give us more re-sale value.  The 6 Cylinder car was really more than I wanted price-wise. Overall I rate the car a Ten.  I am 6'1" and at 280 I was looking for a car that fit me, especially the back seat.  
The back seat is VERY Roomy, with a center fold down arm rest with cup holders, and plenty of head room.  The front seats are well crafted and include leather and heated seats, low and high and lumbar support. Both seats also have the electric adjustments.  The Stereo has a AM/FM and 6 disk CD player, all 6 disks are stored in the dash inside the radio...no weaving all over the road trying to change disks !  There is a volume control, and tuner control on the radio dash and also on the steering wheel.  I use the one on the dash, as driving at night its hard to look down and see what you are fiddling with on the steering wheel. They are also not lit for night driving(steering wheel).  It would have been nice if there had been a momentary L.E.D. under the volume and tuner controls under the steering wheel, for night driving.
The steering wheel is adjustable UP and Down as well as sliding forward and Aft.  The heating/cooling system is unique in that you can adjust hot or cold independent of the other passenger.  The driver can put his/her temperature on say 73 degrees, while the front seat passenger likes his/hers at 80 degrees. It reduces the Marital squabbling as each person can adjust the heat/cold independent from each other and it works great.  If you are driving alone, you can override that function and operate the system as one temperature.  If only Honda could come up with a "seat-belt adjustment" for each driver built into a memory system.  My wife and I are always trading driving duties, so when she gets out, I have to manually adjust the seat belt tensioner at the top to fit my frame, and she is always complaining when she gets in that she has to fiddle with it.  Oh well, life ain't perfect.
The engine is sweet.  Very smooth.  First gear in the automatic I think is slightly to low, but putting the accelerator down, You will be very surprised at the pickup.  It is inspiring.  The car Hauls A**.  The mileage  is great.  Using 87 octane, the cheap stuff, We are getting almost 400 miles per tank.  In town we are getting 30 MPG and a recent Highway trip with Cruise control, we got 34 MPG.  It beats the Nissan Pathfinder hands down, it got like 13 MPG.  I love the car, my wife LOVES the car and we are very happy with it....  
I forgot to mention Trunk room...one word...HUGE.  
The most important things I did not mention were Where to find it and cost.  Go to www.peoplefirst.com which is presently changing their name to Capital One Financing.  We applied over the internet, approved in 24 hours. They FedEx-ed a Blank check to us. So in 48 hours we had a check to go shopping with.  If you arrange to have automated payments from your checking/savings account, they give you a lower interest rate.  We got 3.39% versus mailing a payment in of 3.99%  Honda's financing online...is crap.  You fill out all the information, thinking you are applying for financing and in the end, it prints out all the info on a piece of paper for you to take into the dealership, so the salesman has something else to dicker his price to you.  In my opinion, don't give him/her that chance.  buying a car is a numbers game.  Don't give the dealer that edge or you will pay more for the car. I was amazed that because we brought our own financing in, Honda actually knew a local bank that could drop our financing down EVEN lower, and save us $300 over 60 months, not wanting the paperwork hassle, we did not do that.  ANOTHER great way to afford THE CAR  you want at HONDA is to go to www.edmunds.com and research the car you want.  Price out the car you think you can't afford like I did.  Edmunds then forwards your request for the car you want to all the Honda Dealers in your area.  The lowest price I got back from "Shlossman's Honda" was $2000.0 UNDER DEALER COST. Honda is starting to deal cars on VOLUME using the Internet.  Schlossmans Honda in Milwaukee, WI 
There were NO hidden fees, NO ADD-ON costs, or anything. Basically NO B.S.  Just an honest deal.  I was shocked !
We signed our check, Signed our paperwork, They put tags on the car, and we drove away in 30 Minutes.  I have never in all my years been treated better, or had such an easy time buying a car.  I have owned 3 Honda's so far in my life..2 CRX's and now this Accord.  Well worth the money and I would definately go back to the dealer for another car.  Very satisfied.
