            This is my future car. I have looked at lots of cars and settled on this one. Just recently I was at the LA International Auto Show and saw some really good upcoming models from Chrysler, lincoln, Nissan, BMW, Benz. I was totally blown away by the Lincoln LS1 on dispay that thing was sweeeeet but then I saw the 300M in Slate gray color with black leather interior and 17-18&quot; steel wheels and fell in love with it (don't tell my wife). some of the features that are options on other cars are standard on the 300M, like sun/moon roof, built in CD player with 11 i repeat 11 bose speakers, 252HP, 18gallon tank, 27miles/g on freeway plenty of room in the back seat, comfortable on the eye dash board, everything within reach. If I was single I would've bought this car at the show. I still had the picture of LS1 in the back of my mind so when I got home I did some comparisons between the 2 at carsdirect.com and the 300M came out to be the winner, not only does it have a wider body, bigger trunk, bigger gas tank, more room, more features BUT it is also $10,000 cheaper than the Lincoln LS1.
Overall this is the car to buy for Power, Style, looks and realiability.<br><br>
