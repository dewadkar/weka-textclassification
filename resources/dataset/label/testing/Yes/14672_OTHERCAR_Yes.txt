            If you need a go-anywhere-anytime small wagon, and don't mind a &quot;distinctive&quot; (or quirky) look, you can't go wrong with the Forester.  There are some unexpected, albeit minor shortcomings, though.

I've been driving a 1999 Forester S Automatic in northeast USA for 15 months, never really off-road.  I mean, snow and ice and mud and gravel? yes.  Rock climbing and creek crossing? no.  I'm completely satisfied with the mechanical aspects of this car.  The handling, braking, ride and visibility are excellent.  The seats are nice if a little thin.  The engine is smooth and relatively powerful.  The cabin is high but the center of gravity is very low.  This is one solid machine!  Of course, for the price it really should be.  I rate the value FAIR.

Now, on to the quirkiness.  There's no gear indicator (for auto transmission) on the dashboard.  The door open warning light doesn't tell you WHICH door is open; it's also tied to the time-delayed dome light, so it doesn't mean ANYTHING during the first minute of entering or leaving the car!  With two young kids in the back, you have no idea whether they've closed the doors properly or not.  This is absolutely crazy.  Is there any other car in the world designed this way?

The interior is quiet for this type of cars.  It's so quiet, in fact, that I can hear the high-pitch whine from the fuel pump as I gradually speed up on the highway.  My wife can't hear it at all, so I guess only people &quot;cursed&quot; with good hearing will be bothered by this.

This a short car so the back seats are tight, but the split-adjustable seat backs help.  The turning circle is bigger than one would've assumed.  Don't try your first U-turn on a busy street.  The standard tires are great except for short tread life.  The 16-gallon fuel tank is a little small for the low 20s gas mileage.  Or, I should say the mileage is too low for the small fuel tank.  I have to refuel every six days instead of seven, which messes up my weekly routine :-)

The headroom is tremendous, but Subaru didn't offer a sunroof in the Forester until the 2001 model -- another odd thing considering the price point.

What I like the most about the Forester is -- don't laugh -- the perfect seat height!  It's easier to get in and out of than the regular car (too low), let alone the regular SUV (too high).  It's just like getting in and out of a barstool.  You sit down, you stand up, that's it.

Overall, this is a great car.  However, since I've never taken it off-road, I can't help thinking I've paid a premium (in price and gas mileage) for the &quot;SUV&quot; myth.  I'd probably be better off with an AWD wagon, like the Subaru Legacy or the VW Passat.
