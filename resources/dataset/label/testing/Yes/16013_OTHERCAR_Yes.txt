            Every year one of my siblings graduates from college, and every year my grandparents buy one of us a Toyota Camry.  Although it isn't the typical college graduates choice, it is a good car.

I would buy this car because it will last forever and it will give me good gas mileage.  Great things when you're just starting out in the real world.

But is this what you really want?  A car is a driving experience and the 2001 Camry doesn't do that.  A car is your second home and driving should be an experience, not a chore.  

Interior
The car looks good and I must give Toyota "props" for making the controls in reach of the driver.  But comfort is another story.  The seats feel like you are sitting on leather-wrapped patio furniture.  This is the same as the 2000 Camry. Standing in hour long Chicago traffic really pays a toll.

Also, the controls look too plastic.  There isn't any charm.  This reminds me of Chevy controls.  In that case, the controls are grey.  In the case of the Toyota, the controls are a blah brown.  Really dull...

Forget about backseat room.  I would recommend the backseat for kids.  2 adults have a hard time sitting back there.  This is mainly because the seats are too low.  It makes it so that your thighs can't comfortable touch the seat.

The other positive is the "Japanese Silence Box".  You hear no noise.  Not from the tires, not from the road, and not from the engine.  The last one I don't like b/c i like listening to the purr of my engine.  

Exterior
The car is made of shoddy sheet metal.  When my friend crashed hers there was a lot of expensive damage.  Toyota claims that there will be a lot of body damage because of their large crumple zones.  This means that if you get into an accident, the car crumples as much as it can (to take the force of the impact) so that you don't feel the blow.  

Power
Like the 2000, underpowered.  Even with the v6, this car is a bust.  Maybe i just want more power, but the camry doesn't do it for me off the line.  50 more horsepower would've done the trick.  The torque isn't all that amazing either.
