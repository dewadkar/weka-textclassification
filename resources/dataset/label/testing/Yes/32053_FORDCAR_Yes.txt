            I have had two Explorers, the first one, a 1991, was totalled in an car accident in 1996 and I decided to purchase another one as close to the first as possible.  We were run off the road in a winter snow/ice incident that ended in a roll over accident and it saved our lives!! 
Before we purchased an Explorer to start with, we looked at all SUV's wrecked!  My husband and I have been in Fire and Rescue for numerous years and seeing them wrecked and how they handle it is more important to us as it is to be nice looking!  

Safety is a big factor in buying a SUV and Ford met the challenge!  I went from a mini-van to an Explorer because I needed the 4-wheel drive to get to work in bad weather, I'm a nurse and I need to be able to get to work no matter what the weather does!  We bought a third Explorer for my husband a year ago and now we are a two Explorer family!  We trust our safety and our children's to them and we know that even in a severe crash, our chances of survival are good.  It has already been proven to us and even though the outside of the car was an absolute disaster the inside compartment stayed intact.  

We love the ability to get many options as well as safety features on them and we use them for everything imaginable, my husband uses his hunting and surf fishing and pulling his boat.  I use mine for shopping, taxi service and anything the kids can come up with.  We use every square inch of our vehicles and we have not come up with a challenge that our Explorer's have not been able to meet!  If you are thinking of buying one, think no more!  The hard part is picking the color, the rest is there to count and depend on!<br><br>
