            I bought my 2001 Montero Sport LS 4X4 because my wife and I are expecting a child.  We needed something with a little more space and the Montero Sport sure did the trick.  The only complaint that I have about the vehicle is that it has a little less power than i'm used to.  With it's 173 horsepower it is not a turtle but it is also by no means a speed-demon.  The vehicle rides very smooth on the road, just as smooth as any car I have every owned.  The seats are comfortable and the gas mileage is very well for a vehicle of it's size.  My wife and I average about 23 miles per gallon on the highway and 19 in the city which is slightly above what the vehicle is rated but can vary.  Off-Road the vehicle also does well, it seems to grip well on most surfaces and go up the steepest of hills as long as the GeoLander tires don't break traction.  The vehicle has very good ground clearance, 8.7&quot; I believe is correct which keeps you from bottoming out on most ruts.  The vehicle rolls slightly (As most SUV's do) on sharp tuns but you can still carry fairly good speed through the twisty stuff.  All of the controls are laid out in a simple yet very functional manner.  The 4 wheel drive system is a pull of a lever away, although when the vehicle is cold it can be a chore to get it pulled in right away.  The cupholders, console, and glove box are all very functional and nicely placed to where they're not in the way of things.
Overall I'm very happy with my Montero Sport, I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a SUV.  It is a very functional no-nonsense vehicle and is laid out very nicely.<br><br>
