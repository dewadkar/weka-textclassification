            With little regret, my husband and I have decided to part with our 1996 Pathfinder, and have opted for something that falls into the reliable category. We have been researching both accords and camrys, and have decided to go with Honda. 

The sportier looking family car, the accord, not only has more get-up and go, but it handles better. The camry was a nice ride, and won in the quiet category, but the accord just seems to look and drive a little better.

In comparing resale values, those Hondas hold their value. Certainly, reliability must play a huge factor in this. There are soo many accords on the road, new and old. There aren't a lot of cars from the early 1980's that you still see putting around, that the manufacturer's are still making in 2001.

Function is key. Lots of compartments, cup holders, and arm rests are great little conveniences that add to your comfort. It also seems like you get a lot more equipment standard with the accord that you won't find on other cars. Not just nice little things like keyless entry, but 4 wheel ABS and side airbags. Important things.

We are really excited to bring home our new wheels!
