            I have found the Olds Achieva to be one of the better kept used car values around.    My '97 was purchased with some background knowledge combined with immediate need.   I had been considering a used small car for some time and had driven a wide variety of offerings; import and domestic, 4 cylinder and 6 cylinder, automatics and sticks.    I had already ruled out the imports such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota as the used prices are just too inflated for my planned budget.    Past experiences with Escorts ruled out that option, so I looked pretty much at GM, Mazda, and Chrysler offerings.   For a variety of reasons I chose the Achieva and have not been disappointed.

Having driven both the 4 and the 6 cylinder models of Achieva, Buick Skylark and Pontiac Grand Am, I decided that it did not make any difference to me.   The four has plenty of power for daily use even though it had to &quot;work&quot; a little harder than the 6.    I was very surprised when I took it into the mountains of Colorado and found that is was quite capable in that surrounding as well, I was expecting to have to crawl up the heights.   The engine has been trouble free, requiring only the scheduled maintenance.   Not at all what I had been told by some opponents of the four used in this body of GM cars.    It is not as smooth as some of the competition, however, the reliability and the power have been a big plus.

One of the real deciding factors in my purchase was the high level of equipment.   Although my car was a program (in this case a National rental car from Hawaii), it was equipped with an automatic, cruise, tilt, power windows, power locks, cassette/AM/FM, aluminum wheels and best of all, traction control and ABS.   My understanding is that the Olds Achieva has ABS and Traction Control as standard equipment on most models, but that it was an option on Grand Am, but I have not confirmed this.    The traction control systems really works!   I live in the midwest, and I never had a situation where the traction control let me down.   You can definitely feel the difference on slick roads if you turn off the control, and you will find that you will re-engage it immediately.    ABS brakes take some getting used to if you have not had them previously, but I had them on other cars, so they too were a welcome feature.

This was my first car with daytime running lights.   After years of laughing at the cars with them, I discovered the many conveniences of them.   The added visibility is nice, but not having to turn on my lights is a pretty high second value.    To leave a lit parking lot and drive down a well lit street and not once forgetting to turn on my lights was a nice plus.

The comfort inside was no better or worse than most cars in its class.   Even though it shares the same platform as the Grand Am and the Skylark, I felt more comfortable inside the Olds.   The Grand Am is just to tacky, especially the dashboard.    The seats are quite comfortable for short trips, but longer trips require an occasional stop to stretch out.   Controls were easy to reach and the only problem I had was the base control knob of the radio would come off when I pulled it out to adjust it.

Another big plus in buying the Olds Achieva was the price.   Even though it and the Skylark are brothers under the skin with the more popular Pontiac, it ran about $1,500 less than the comparable Grand Am, and the Grand Am did not have Traction Control!   I can see no reason for buying the Grand Am over its siblings.    My children now drive the Achieva, as I have stepped up to the Intrigue, and they really like it as well.   It is not too &quot;nerdy&quot; for them with the deck spoiler and the aluminum wheels, and they like the way it drives.

All in all, I think that the Olds Achieva represents a very very good buy in its field.   I do not hesitate to recommend it to friends, and those who have bought one (usually for a kids car) have been pleased with theirs as well.     Congrats to Olds for making a car that is much better than most realize.   Practical and affordable makes a hard combination to beat.<br><br>
