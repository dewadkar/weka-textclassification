            First let me start by stating that I recently &quot;traded-in&quot; the above mentioned vehicle. Secondly, I would like to say, &quot;boy was that a mistake.&quot;

I owned a 1994 GMC Jimmy which I bought used in 1995. This vehicle was as close to a luxury vehicle as you can come,and still be classified as a SUV. It had every option available in a mid-size luxury car, and the ride was very comparable. This was the nicest looking of the SUV's, in my opinion, and the interior was very roomy and comfortable. The vehicle handled well both on and off road, and was very nice to use for travel, especially with our teenagers. There was lots of leg room, and plenty of space in the cargo area for luggage. It was a four door model which was very convenient with the teenagers, as well as for the times when we had an evening out with friends or family.

Winters in our area can be very trying without the four-wheel drive, and this option came in handy several times. This particular vehicle had the shift-on-the-fly feature, which enables one to shift into four-wheel drive without leaving the vehicle. This feature comes in very handy when your are sitting in 10 inches of snow or worse yet, MUD.

The instructions for this review ask that I include all the good and the bad things about this vehicle. The only thing negative I can think of about this vehicle is that I no longer own it. Seriously, I have no complaints about the Jimmy, and hopefully soon will be trading in my luxury car for another SUV.

This is a very easy vehicle to maintain. Parts and labor were always reasonable when any repair or upkeep was needed. Both our teenage daughters drove the vehicle, and it was good for them because they were sitting up &quot;higher&quot; and could see well. We had over 150,000 miles on this vehicle when I traded it in, and it still had only had routine upkeep done on it, and no major repair problems.

I think this vehicle could be used by all ages, as well as those who want a more casual style vehicle and also this vehicle would be enjoyed by those who appreciate style and comfort.<br><br>
