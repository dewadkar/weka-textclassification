            The Grand Cherokee was my second Jeep and I can't say enough good about it.  I live in a rural mountain community that can get up to ten feet of snow during the winter.  I drive over 30,000 miles a year, and have never not made it home or missed any appointments driving my Grand Cherokee.  It drives like a car, but gets you anywhere.  On the downside, I had a few problems with holes in the exhaust system.  I think it needs a bit more protection of the undercarriage, but overall it is a great vehicle.  <br><br>
