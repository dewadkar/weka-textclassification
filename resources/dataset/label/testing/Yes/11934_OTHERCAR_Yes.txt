            Digital cameras are the only way to go with children...the advantage to this one is the preview screen if you dont like the shot... DELETE it.. and waa laa you can do a new one 2 seconds apart.  THEY are battery hogs if you leave the preview screen on all the time.  
I think that you need to get the bigger memory for it.. the 2meg just is not enough...but they arent that expensive and the amount of pics I have saved from film/developing is ASTRONOMICAL!!  

You will need a nice printer so you can share hard copy pics.. but for email GREAT... and Ebay people this is the way to show your items a pic will get you a higher bid if you show the item (and NO reserve price will help too hint hint)  I ordered mine from computers4sure.com on a friday and by that monday had my camera! I got mine for 199 and its the best... I have the blue one...it is very attractive not that it really matters... but its a bonus!

NOTHING like having pics of a newborn baby on the net within hours of birth....etc etc etc...

This features you would expect from a very expensive camera...ok the quality is not the same.. but if you just want pics very nice and fast.. this is the way to go!  the diff between this camera and a 500+camera... isnt worth the extra money! really.... now for the 1000 if you have it.. go for it...<br><br>
