            How does one describe the Honda Insight. Technologically advanced? Yep? Strange-looking? Yep. Limited in ability? Yep. Normal-feeling? Yep. Huh? Wait a minute!

That's right. This car drives and behaves like most other "conventional" small cars I've driven. It's got peppy acceleration, it's nimble and has a cockpit that lets a lot of road noise leak through. But, wait? Isn't this some kind of whiz-bang, environmentally friendly car? Isn't this packed with mind-numbing technology? It certainly is, but you don't notice any of that stuff working. I believe that's exactly the point.

Before I get into describing the highlights of this wonderful car, I should mention that I don't own it. I took it for a test drive as part of my job. I'm a business reporter for a daily newspaper and was assigned the task of researching these "hybrid" cars, test driving one and writing about them. The Honda Insight has been sighted in Northwest Arkansas as has its competition, the Toyota Prius. I drove the Insight because I could find one at a local Honda lot and the Toyota had to be specially-ordered before one would arrive in this area.

That being said, I just loved the Insight. This thing gets about 65 MPG and is a low-emissions vehicle. So, it's environmentally-friendly, if you like that type of thing. I like the great gas mileage, and was impressed with the price of this vehicle -- $20,000 by the time you install an air conditioner, and that's not bad.

The Insight is powered by a 1.0-litre, three-cylinder engine that's assisted by an electric motor. Unlikely the silly electric cars we used to read about, the Insight doesn't have to be plugged into a wall and charged and it doesn't have a pathetic range. Remember reading about electric cars that had to be plugged up and charged for several hours and only had a range of about 60 miles? Those days, friends, are over.

Honda was very clever in designing the Insight. The thing only weighs 1,800 pounds (LOTS of aluminum, folks), so you don't notice that it's only pumping out 76 horses. The electric motor is used when you need a "power boost" under hard acceleration, and it does make for a peppy little car. As soon as you hit that electric motor, you get the top of that motor's torque curve instantly, and I found it fairly easy to pass vehicles on the highway and had no problem getting the Honda up to a cruising speed of around 80 MPH. Oh, did I mention that the "slow" speeds we used to read about for electric cars are gone, too?

The electric motor charges in three ways. First, the gasoline engine carries the car at "cruising" speeds, and generates electricity for the car's on-board batteries. Second, energy generated from friction during braking goes into the batteries. The batteries charge, too, when the car is coasting.

That's nice and all, but what does it all mean for the driver? Owners of this thing put gas in it, change the oil from time to time and get routine maintenance done. That's it. You don't do anything to this car you wouldn't with the one that's out in your driveway. That's radical stuff, as far as I'm concerned. This stuff works, folks, and you don't even realize it's happening.

For example, I was driving through town in the Insight when I pushed in the clutch, dropped the car in neutral and came to a stop.

"Listen to the engine," the salesman said.

"What do you mean? I don't hear anything," I replied.

"That's right."

"Does it normally do that?" I asked.

"Yes," he said. "This is the third time that's happened since you've been driving it."

I hadn't even noticed. What was happening was that the gasoline engine was shutting down when the car was stopped for a period of time. When the car was put in gear, it would turn back on and I'd just drive around as usual. And, I had no idea that was happening. Best of all, I didn't care that was happening. I didn't have to. All I had to do was drive the thing. Isn't that what all of us want in a car, really? Just get down the road without troubling us?

For those who are curious, a warranty comes on this thing that covers the batteries. It's a three-year/36,000-mile warranty that comes standard with all Hondas. That provides some peace of mind because I imagine those batteries are expensive.

So, you get a car that behaves like you'd expect a small car to act, it's got good acceleration and it gets great gas mileage. So, is this the car of the future? Not exactly. There are some problems with it.

First of all, it only seats two people. While that might not bother some folks, I've got a Wife and two kids. Wait, maybe that <i>would</i> be the ideal car for me. I could see it now:

<b>Ms. Hawg:</b> Honey, you need to take the kids to Point A.

<b>Hawgwyld:</b> Not me, baby. I've only got two seats. Wheeeee!

Then, off I'd go.

Well, maybe not. The thing about this car is that it's got plenty of room in the back, but that's where the batteries are. You've got a hatchback arrangement there with storage space on top of the batteries, and a smaller compartment at the very back of the hatchback that's used for storage of "deeper" items.

The salesman told me that Honda has plans to move the battery pack further to the back of the vehicle and make room for a bench seat. That back seat will be mighty cramped, I'd bet.

Also, this car only comes with a five-speed, manual transmission. That's not a problem for me as I prefer standard trannies, and this one has a crisp, light clutch and a very positive feel that lets you know when it's in gear.

Once again, Honda plans to put an automatic transmission in these things.

Ultimately, then, you'll have a car with a back seat and the option of an automatic transmission. That setup will be closer to a practical vehicle than the Insight is now. I imagine it will remind many of a Honda Civic, but that's just my guess.

For those interested in comparing this to the Toyota Prius, I only know the technical specs. The Prius is powered by a four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for assist and gets 48 MPG. It has an automatic transmission and seats five. I don't know a whole lot else about the Prius other than the fact that it and the Insight are the only hybrid cars on the block. Hopefully, you'll like one or the other.

Now, I'll have to admit that I've always hated Hondas. Well, up until today, that is. I've always thought they were more expensive than they should be. In retrospect, perhaps I hated them because everyone in their dog wanted one. You know the drill -- a couple of middle-management types start comparing the features of their Accords and I'd get ill.

Honda got my attention today, though. The Insight is a true achievement, and the reality of a hybrid car is here. This thing feels like a typical small car in spite of all the sexy technology, and that says a lot for the engineering team at Honda. If they can come up with a car like this, perhaps I've been wrong about the company all along.

<b>UPDATE!</b>

I talked to a fellow today who bought one of these cars last year. He's from Northwest Arkansas and has driven it to San Francisco and back, and he's also made trips to Baton Rouge and Miami. Here's the surprising thing -- he's had NO problems with the car at all. Indeed, he just puts gas in it, changes the oil and that's about it.

That man reported a whopping 80 MPG on the open highway and 70 MPG on these hills in the Ozarks. Now, there's something to think about, and another reason to pay attention to this car.
