            I think that for the non-professional digicam buyer there are only two real choices: the Canon S100 and the Fuji MX-4700 due to their size and weight and usability. The following review highlights the pros and cons of each from the viewpoint of the Canon camera

[LCD]  Both cameras have bright LCDs that are easy to see however
      + Canon has anti-reflective coating on the LCD makes it viewable in 
         direct sunlight, Fuji has glare in sunlight
      - Canon's anti-reflective coating makes the LCD soft and easily 
         damaged, while the Fuji is protected by a hard (but reflective) 
         coating
      - Canon 1.5&quot; vs Fuji 2.0&quot; (diagonal)  

[Zoom when shooting]  
- Canon has 2X optical vs Fuji 3X optical. Both have 
                        4x digital zoom
                     - Fuji's optical/digital zoom is stepless and smooth.
                        Canon is not as smooth, noisier, and requires you 
                        to zoom full optical, then it makes some  
                        noise/pauses for 2 seconds and then switches to 
                        2X digital zoom. Repeat for 4X zoom.

[Zoom on playback]   
-  Canon's zoom is fixed at 2.5X and you can only 
                        scroll left/right between the top/middle/bottom 
                        sections of the image.
                    -  Fuji lets you zoom from steplessly up to 4x to 15x 
                        (depending on the shot's resolution) and you can 
                        scroll anywhere you like easily using its 4-way 
                        buttons

[Low-Light shooting]  
+ Canon's images are more accuate without flash 
                        while the Fuji has a yellow cast
                     + Canon can focus in complete darkness, Fuji has 
                        problems focusing in low light, but it has 
                        an ISO of 200-800 versus Canon's ISO 100 (higher 
                        sensitivity)

[Interface]     
      -  Fuji is very easy to use, has 4-way direction 
                         switch with a changing LCD behind it. Switching 
                         through menus are very fast while the Canon are 
                         delayed 1/2 to 1 second for each button press 
                         and the menus are not as intuitive

[Macro]  
    Both cameras have motion/blur warning
               - Canon has no autofocus warning, Fuji does
               + Canon gets as close as 4&quot; while Fuji is 8&quot;               
    
[Erasing a picture]
   Fuji:  Press Menu x 3
                    Canon:  Press Menu, SET, SET, RIGHT, SET
                           
[Shooting/Playback]
    Both cameras have a convenient toggle switch for 
                      choosing between shooting and playback modes. 
                    +  The Canon lets you hold down the shutter after 
                        taking a shot to see the shot for as long as you 
                        hold it down. Release button to take another 
                        shot. 
                    -  When switching from shooting mode to playback 
                        mode, the Canon's lens retracts/pauses for 2 
                        seconds when you try to scroll through pictures. 
                        The Fuji lens stays extended until you turn it off
                    +  Canon's LCD turns on automatically on shoot mode 
                        while the Fuji requires a push of the &quot;disp&quot; 
                        button 

[Battery]
  + Canon comes with a quick 2-hour &quot;smart&quot; charger that knows 
             when the battery is fully charged, but it is still recommend 
             you remove the battery after 24 hours to prevent battery 
             damage, the Fuji is a &quot;dumb&quot; charger that charges full blast 
             and you must remove it after 13hours
          + Canon uses Lithium battery, which is lightweight(1oz)and has 
             little discharge over periods of time when the battery is  
             unused while Fuji's NiMH discharges ~3-5% per day.
          - Extra Lithium batteries are $45, so carrying spare batteries 
             is costly, while the Fuji comes with 4 AA but only uses 2  
             AA NiMH at a time which are $7 a pair.            

[Software]
   +  Canon includes Photostitching software to blend
               together several photos into one, useful for landscape   
               shots
            +  Canon lets you upload pictures to camera, Fuji you can 
                only download
            -  Canon's software is slow and not intuitive and takes 10 
                seconds to load 

[USB Transfer]  
- Fuji, plug in the USB cable, and 2 seconds later it
                 appears as a removable drive, the Canon is still loading
              - Canon pauses 1-2 seconds with a hard disk write after  
                 each picture is copied, the Fuji copies as fast as USB 
                 can handle with no pauses
              - When connected to the computer the Fuji displays the 
                 camera status with its LED and secondary LCD while the 
                 Canon has no status, with only LED blinks 
                 when copies are taking place.

[Movies]
  - Fuji can store up to 80 seconds of continuous video at 10fps 
            with sound as .AVI files and can also playback the movies 
            with sound on the camera itself. Canon has no movie feature.

[Underwater accessory]

                          lets you take it up to 10 feet underwater
