            I wrote a review earlier on this car, and here is another one, a few more things I remembered plus some research on this car.  As I stated in my previous opinion, I didn't have major problems with the car.  A piece broke on the glove box latch causing it to not close and me having to use my McGyver abilities to rig it shut because the light bulb wouldn't come out.  Also, there was a recall on the airbags because if something on the bottom of the car hit bottom, then the airbags would deploy. It was a computer problem.

One thing I did not mention was that sometimes, the key would not want to turn in the ignition and I would sometimes be late to where I was going because it just wouldn't turn.  IF you call 1-800-Chevyusa, they tell you to tap the key with a spoon while it is in the ignition.  Also, the air of the time I traded it in, but it was close, the air conditioning was compressor seal has a tendency to go bad.  Mine had not gone bad yet as making a strange sound and wasn't working as well as it used to.  The car was only 3 years old and after doing some research, I found that I wasn't the only one who was having compressor problems in the third year of the car.  Most that I found though had already gone bad, but mine hadn't gone completely.  So, depending on the car and the frequency of air conditioning use depends on how fast it will go.  Some may not go out at all.

The car rates a 17 on an insurance scale of safety, which is high, the higher the more dangerous.  A hail storm caused over $2,000 hail damage to the car and the hail really wasn't that big. I had 50 dents on the roof.  The paint had to be stripped and everything.  Also, gravel caused $600 in damage because an angry person spun gravel all over it.  So, the body of the car can't take too much.

Running wise, the car was fine, it had almost 50,000 miles on it when I traded it in, but when I traded it in, it was only worth $2,000 on my trade in because of everything that happened to it.  The strange thing is that every time there was damage to the car, I wasn't in it.

Comfort is something I enjoyed about the car.  I took long road trips in it and never had a back pain.  Also, in my car, I had just a tape deck, but the sound system isn't half bad.  Controls are easy to get to and the car is pretty roomy.  Trunk size is pretty great too.  A couple of friends threw me in it once.

It is a good little car, just high maintenance I think.  I believe that the things can be prevented if they are checked on occasionally and caught before something bad actually happens.  I do recommend this car, I do miss it because it got me from point a to point b and the payment wasn't bad.  <br><br>
