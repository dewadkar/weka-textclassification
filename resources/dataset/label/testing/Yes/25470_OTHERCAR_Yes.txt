             I bought my Saturn on Oct.13,1998.  I paid $12,985 for the car. Before buying her I did a lot of homework. Checking consumer reports and asking other Saturn owners. So far I have put 50,000 miles on her and have not had any problems with her . I do the every 3,000 miles oil changes and other service related  necessities. As far as I am concerned , A Saturn would be a great investment for anyone wanting good mileage and  a car that can be depended on. I have been on all types of terrain with her and she has yet to let me down. Now I know there is always a bad car once in a while but I believe that Saturn Team  will take care of any and all problems quickly and timely.  So for anyone wanting a Saturn L series car they should check them out. I get 40 miles to the gallon and am quite satisfied with my investment.  <br><br>
