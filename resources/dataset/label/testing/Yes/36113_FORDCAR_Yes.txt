            I bought this vehicle to tow behind an RV- It is the base model LX with a 5 speed overdrive, Air Conditioning and Stereo Cassette. I added an aftermarket speed control thru the dealership.About everything else is standard. First of all, I like the car. It is extremely roomy for its size and seats 4 comfortably for 2-3 hours. One thing I do miss is an armrest between the front seats but a unique feature of the car is that the driver's seat has a manual height adjuster which I don't recall seeing on any other car. The windshield wiper is a 3 speed, a delay, midspeed and fastspeed. Another thing I miss on this base model is power doorlocks and windows but those are available on the higher priced models. For what I wanted the car for I can put up without those features.The economy is as advertised, at speed limits of 65-70mph I am getting 33+ miles per gallon. Around town it approaches the higher 20's. The base engine of 110HP is peppy at lowgear ranges but tops out pretty quick - however I don't have any problems at getting up to and holding freeway speeds and contrary to other opinions have had no problem with the shifter being easy to dislodge from any gear. Don't have any little children riding with me though. The ride is decent, some road noise but tolerable.  If I were buying the car for something other than I bought it for, I believe that I would opt for the Hatchback with the larger engine.
 They are sharp looking. I have also seen a Focus that the dealer sent out for some aftermarket addons, scoops, dams, flairs etc and that one really looked good but it added $3,000 to the price. I don't have a lot of miles on it yet, approaching 2000 but thusfar is is a good buy in my opinion.

It is now about 7 months after the above comments, car has just over 6000 on the odometer but it was towed over 9500 additional miles. At freeway speeds of 65-70, mpg now exceeding 37, great in these high gas price days. One downer, just got a recall for left rear wheel bearings, hope that is not a sign of times to come. Still really like this car though.<br><br>
