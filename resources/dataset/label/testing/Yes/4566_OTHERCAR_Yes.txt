            I was in the market for a compact sedan as the Subaru wagon that I had was on it's last legs. I gravitated towards the Geo Prizm because I had heard it was built alongside the Toyota Corolla at the same plant in California. Everyone knows Toyota is well-known for it's quality products, so I figured I'd save a grand or so and purchase the lesser known Prizm. It was a fairly base model with A/C and ABS as the only options. The Prizm had a smooth-shifting 5 speed transmission. This is a good thing because if it were an automatic, I may have had to push the car when the A/C was on. Not a whole lot of power (rated at 105 hp) from the 1.5 liter 4 banger. But this lack of power was overlooked by me when I realized what type of fuel mileage I was getting. 37 mpg on the highway, and that's cruising at 75 on the interstate! I was very impressed to say the least. I never owned a vehicle that got over 30 mpg let alone 37 so I was a happy camper. As far as interior comfort, the little Prizm never let me down, the Toyota Genes shown through here also with the excellent fit and finish throughout the cabin. The front bucket seats were quite comfortable, even on long trips and the rear seats had just enough leg room for our 10 year old son. One drawback was there was no pass-thru to the trunk from the rear seat. I think this was rectified in later models. Although the car was underpowered, the engine itself was a gem. Idling at a stop light you would hardly see any vibration or hear any audible engine noise. Impressive. The car handled very well too. It had decent sized 14" tires and rims that kept the car well-planted even on off-ramps. The exterior of the car has the worn soap look to it, but Geo did a good job of putting a smidgen of style with the headlight and taillight assemblies.
