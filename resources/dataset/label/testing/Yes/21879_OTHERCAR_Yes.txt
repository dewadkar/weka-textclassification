            I've been driving the outback for several months now, and I must admit it's got a lot of great advantages. I, personally, am a bit more of a sports car enthusiast, but as a family car the outback is a good choice for a safe, quiet, comfortable ride. The All Wheel Drive and ABS are notable, especially in compromising weather conditions. It's a solid, reliable car with chassy space to spare. With four spacious seats and a huge &quot;trunk&quot; area, you're anything but cramped. The automatic transmission provides a respectably smooth ride unless you push it at all (even a little bit), in which case shifting feels like an amusement park thrill-ride. The car is strangely extremely underpowered, even at higher RPM. With a 2.5L four-banger, you'd think it would be a little quicker. Towing is a joke in this car. The lackluster stereo was insufficient for virtually everyone I asked. The seats are big and not UNcomfortable, but they're like sitting on a board compaired to most modern seats. I've found the Outback to be a perfect choice for soccer-moms, but only if a sound system of any merit isn't important. For the price, you'd be crazy to buy this car new. For heaven's sake, for 30k, buy an Infinity.<br><br>
