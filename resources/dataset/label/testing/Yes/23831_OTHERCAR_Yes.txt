            I was set on purchasing another Toyota my previous car was a 1982 Toyota Celica GT but at 200,000 it started having a few too many problems. I set out to find another NEW Toyota that fit into my budget. The Toyota ECHO certainly fit the bill, AND it cornered pretty much like my Celica (not quite but close enough) there was no noticeable power loss between the Celica and the ECHO also the ECHO had something over the Celica when I turned the air conditioning on it barely effected acceleration! 

I like the car for many reasons: shoulder &amp; lap belts in all 3 positions in the rear seat, headrests in the rear seats, the gauges in the center of the dash is VERY nice and more convenient in my opinion, it has little things you would not expect from a car of it's price such as pressure sensors in the front seats that can tell if someone is sitting in the passenger's or driver's seat and if they are buckled in or not, if they are not it lets you know about it, it has dual trip meters, a digital odometer (have not decided if that is good or bad yet), and a valet key. Things I don't like about the car though are: it does feel a little cheap with all the plastic, the rear-view mirror seems to distort a lot (I wonder if I have a defective mirror, and rear turn signals are quite hard to see during the day.

All in all I am VERY happy with my new ECHO, I feel like I am driving a newer version of my Celica, it shifts pretty much the same, has pretty much the same power, and corners about the same (believe it or not the height does not seem to really effect the cornering to much).<br><br>
