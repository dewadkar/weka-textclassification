            When I bought this camera, I knew I wanted high quality pictures, high quality enough to print at 8.5 x 11 inches.  What I didn't expect was an ultra-long battery life, a Carl Zeiss lens, total manual control over my pictures, a basic video movie mode, incredibly easy to use menus and in-camera special effects.

First, the battery life.  This is always the bane of most digital cameras --- watch how most burn through their batteries within an hour or so.  Not so with this camera.  With this Sony, the battery lasts several hours, can be recharged while still in the camera, and best yet, tells you how many minutes of battery life you have left.  It is a far leap ahead of the "Battery good, battery dying" I've seen from most digital cameras.

Next, the Carl Zeiss lens.  I love photography but never knew what that meant.  A good friend of mine who is an avid photographer was shocked to hear that a digital camera had this lens.  I asked her what it meant and she said "If I've heard of it, it's pretty good."  What it means for the end user is that pictures have incredible detail which can be better than some 5 megapixel cameras.

The manual control is unusual with lower end digital cameras.  But, with a camera of this quality, it makes a huge difference.  You can select aperture, shutter speed or full manual.  The full manual mode allows taking of breathtaking sunsets, blurry waterfalls, as well as pictures in situations where the automatic settings don't get it quite right.  The shutter speed and aperture settings allow different types of control --- the camera will choose the setting not controlled.  

The movie mode is by no means a replacement for a camcorder, but it is a handy way of catching a brief action sequence with sound to send to friends via email or drop on a web site.  The movies are, at most 320x200 in size, or approximately half that size for the "MPEG EX" mode (which allows movies to be much longer, up to 90 minutes on a 128 MB memory stick).

The menus deserve special mention.  Most digital cameras are covered with buttons which use cryptic icons to indicate the state of the camera.  With the Sony, most of the features (white balance, ISO film speed equivalent, special effects, picture quality preferences and so on) are accessed through semi-transparent menus which are overlayed on the picture through the LCD display.  The four-way touch-pad navigates through the menus, and pressing the pad makes selections.  This is very intuitive and easy to use.

The in-camera special effects are the usual suspects --- black & white, sepia tone, solarize.  They do add a nice creative touch to pictures taken with this camera, although I rarely use them.

I have used this camera to take pictures ranging from outdoor scenery to pets, people, and action sequences, indoors and outdoors on cloudy and sunny days.  In about 90% of the cases, the fully automatic mode takes great pictures.  For most of the remaining 10%, the manual modes can compensate for the limitations except for very long-exposure night pictures.  

The only pictures that give this camera difficulty are overexposed shots (which give a halo effect around parts of the picture).  

Once I have taken the pictures, downloading them to my PC was very easy.  I installed the driver software, connected the camera to the provided USB connector, and turned the camera on.  In a few seconds, the images and movies in the camera were available as files in a new drive in Windows.  I copied pictures from them and have never seen a crash or bug even though I'm using Windows XP Professional.

However, if you're not sure about digital photography, buy a cheaper digital camera first to be sure digital photography is right for you.

In conclusion, I have loved this camera ever since I bought it, am highly impressed with the features and the quality,  and know the camera is pretty durable (it has resided in my soft briefcase for the past 8 months with no complaint).  I'd recommend the camera to anyone who is looking to replace a medium-range SLR camera and is serious about digital photography.
