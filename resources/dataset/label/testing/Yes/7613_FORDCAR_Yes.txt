            Finally!  I have wanted a convertible, any convertible since before I could drive.  My favorite being the 1964 1/2 Mustang.  The cost to have one rebuilt was always out of my league, so I just sat back and drooled.  The boxy style that people were getting in the 80's and early 90's was out of the question.  Those didn't even look like Mustangs.  Then along came the 1994 body style.  I couldn't afford one of those either, but it was fun to dream.  Then in 1995, we had to replace my car, it was old and had a head gasket leak (external) and was not expected to live much longer.  Without telling me, my husband called around to the Ford dealers and found 1994 program cars.  He just said let's go look at some more cars.  On the way he told me we were checking out convertibles!  We pulled onto the parking lot and he pointed at the row of cars and I just said, &quot;the red one.&quot;  I have always been a Ford enthusiast and this car just strengthens my opinion.  

MY car is a 1994, the darker red with tan top and interior.  6 cylinder, automatic (there were no sticks available), tape player, Ford factory sound, pretty basic.  We were glad to get the 6 cylinder engine, gas mileage was an issue at the time, but disappointed about the automatic.  The automatic transmission functions well, better than well but I still think the manual would have been more fun.  There is the option of turning off the overdrive which makes pulling into traffic quicker and less taxing on the engine.  

The top is super simple to put up and down.  I can do it myself from the driver's seat with my seatbelt on.  

The front seats are fairly comfortable for a few hours, but the doors feel noticeably close.  I feel an extreme need to ride with my elbow propped on the top of the door.  The back seat is rather small.  Really only one adult over about 5'3&quot; will fit back there.  We were pleasantly surprised by the trunk space.  There is more than we expected, but you really cannot get any super bulky luggage or packages to fit.  A couple of sand chairs and a big gym bag will fill it up.   

The factory stereo is Ford's usual good quality.  It picks up stations that our Pontiac couldn't and the speakers sound better than the GM stock.  They make plenty of noise without getting too distorted.

And now for the ride...you can tell that the suspension is stiffer than most passenger cars.  Bumps in the road are a little more noticeable, but a lot better than the 1995 Probe that we also tested at the time.  Cornering is great.  The car feels very low to the ground and stuck to the road even though the ground clearance is good enough for most roads.  Definitely lots of fun to drive!  We fight over it in the summer. When the weather turns bad, we put the car away until it warms up again (2-3 months in Virginia) so I don't know how the rear wheel drive would handle in the snow.

We have had no problems with this car which required repair.  There was a transmission issue which felt like the steering wheel was chugging in your hand when the engine needed to shift to 3rd gear.  Our garage informed us that there is a known problem with the automatic transmission on the Mustangs and some others and there is really nothing that can be repaired.  They put some engine treatment stuff in for us and we have had no more trouble with it.

Bottom line, my husband has been converted from a GM loyalist to a Mustang enthusiast.  We love the car and will keep it 'til we are old and grey!
