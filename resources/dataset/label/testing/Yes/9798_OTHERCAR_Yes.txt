            I am now 21 years old and live in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. I love cars in general and love to drive even more.  (The more power and speed the better)  I lucked up with a great job and purchased my 1997 Lincoln Town Car Signature Series at age 18. 

 I have never regretted the purchase.  The car rides like a dream, you float over even the big bumps on the mountain roads I always travel on.  My friends all have small foreign cars like the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  They made fun of me for buying this monster until I beat everyone of them off the starting line.  Needless to say, they don't call it an old person's car anymore. 

 Now, when we go to the beach or on any trip, they always ask to take my car.  The interior space is great and the trunk is so big we don't have to make room in the front for any of the extra's we like to take along like golf clubs.  It's not a gas guzzler either.  When we went to Baton Rouge, LA for Marti Gras, we got 32 MPG.  On the trip back we still got a great 28 MPG. The brakes are great.  I have never had a problem stopping in time for the Mazda driver that pulled out in front of me.  

Another thing I like about this automobile is the prestige it brings.  No other vehicle on earth is as stately and elegant as the Town Car.  If it's speed you like, then the Town Car can definitely deliver.  The best my nerves would let me do was 138 mph in a long straight-away. On trips, I put the Cruise Control on 90 (always late night or early a.m. to avoid the trooper's) 

Since I am young I can honestly say that I give this automobile a work out.  I don't slow down for bumps and I often squeal tires at stop lights.  Through all the things I have put this automobile through, I have never had a problem.  I'd like to see if a Mercedes or Rolls could last as long doing the things I do with my Town Car and not have any problems.  (I don't think they could)  I once went all the way to Springfield, MO which is over 1200 miles and stopped only once for gas.  The trip took a little over 12 hours of driving between me and one of my friends and we held at least 90 the whole way on interstates. (I'll never figure out why I never got a speeding ticket) 

Anyone that likes a beautiful, traditional, luxurious, turnpike-cruiser- I Definitely Recommend the 1997 Lincoln Town Car.  I think Ford did a major injustice by the redesign in 1998.  If you don't like a car with lots of umph!, then don't get the Town Car.  Also anyone that is afraid of driving in general, I don't recommend the Town Car - it is big - and needs an experienced driver.  <br><br>
