            I love this car. I have never driven one, but I love Mustangs!! I will own one. There is nothing I hate about this car. Everyone should give their car to me. Just kidding. If you know anyone who is interested in selling a Mustang between the years of 64-70 have them email me at: Princess_Blondie_83@yahoo.com
Please only write about the car. If you have something else to say or if you yourself is a Mustang lover, let me know. I love to talk to people who love the same things as me.  I Love the Mustang.  I WILL have one. I know everything about it. I even have a Mustang shrine. I don't see how people can't love this car. I wish that I was in the 60s so that I could buy this car cheep and have one. The prices people are asking for are WAY too high. Expecially for the quality of the car. Make sure you know what you are selling. 
Thanks<br><br>
