            Interior: 
features 
- manual adjustment (not power) on both front seats (identical). A "ratchet" handle on the side raises/lowers the seat.  It does so at an angle leaning the seat forward when ratcheting up and leaning it back when ratcheting down. It would be more convenient if the seat went straight up and down.  The height adjuster would normally be the same handle on other cars that reclines the seat.  Instead, you have a round knob at the pivot point of the seat that you use to recline.  Although the height adjustment comes in handy, the reclining knob is a pain when you're on the road on a long trip, tired, and want to lay back (in the co-driver's seat of course).

-tilt steering wheel allows for better visibility of road and meters.

-console places all features within reach

-fabric interior - Horrible!  I have black and it collects all the lint.  It's nearly impossible to vacuum enough to remove the visible lint and you practically have to scrub with the vacuum attachment to get everything.  This only applies to the seats . . .carpet is standard.

-cup holders are also poorly designed.  The rear cup holder is worthless and the front will only hold the small size drinks.  It's placement in the front(just below the vents)also make it susceptible to spills while shifting gears, using the radio, or adjusting the climate.

-armrest is convenient in that is moves up and down (and out of the way), but latch closure was poorly designed (plastic piece with a spring).  Mine broke after just a few "not so gentle" closes and now flips open whenever it is pushed to the 'up' position. 

-trunk space!! and lots of it!  You'd be surprised what can fit in there (besides the full size tire). . .and even more with the back seats folded down.  Although, the front seats cannot be slid all the way back when the rear seats are folded down.  Beware the size of the opening, it makes some odd or tall sized items impossible to fit through, in these cases, though I had been able to just fit them in the back seat since the rear door openings are fairly wide/tall.


SAFETY FEATURES
-child seat compatibility: seatbelts require use of locking clips (difficult to do this in a compact car) and only the middle seat for this year model has a tether hook.  Would only be able to fit 2 smaller people in the back with a carseat in the middle.

-airbags, dual front and side (located in the seat itself). Smaller people having to sit closer to the wheel may not have the recommended clearance the driver's side airbag.

-rear seat door opens with 2 pulls of the handle from the inside instead of 1...an additional safety feature to the child locks.
 
-rear windows only open 3/4 of the way.  All power windows automatically retract back open with slight pressure from any obstruction.

-doors automatically lock at initial acceleration.  Driver's door will only lock after all doors are closed and only using the remote keyless entry (or the key itself in the door).  This is good for people who tend to lock themselves out of their car.  But you can still lock yourself out by shutting the driver's side door, opening another, pressing the lock on the Key fob, throwing the keys in and then closing the door. 

MAINTENANCE:
-Standard 2 year warranty only includes service at 5000, 10K and 20K.  Any regular maintenance in between is not included (i.e. oil changes)...although the maintenance schedule only requires oil changes at every 10K miles.  Don't get the extended warranty that the dealer sells!! It's a waste of money!  It only covers major repair on the mechanical design of the engine and German engineering stands well on is own.

-Oil changes (although I haven't done one myself on this car) seem fairly easy with a top/bottom accessible oil filter, but a cover that must be removed from below to drain oil.

-Hood - stays up without needing one of those 'props' (metal rods).

-Minor tune-up impossible without the right tools (spark plugs not easily accessible.  (Air filter replacement is a cinch).

-light bulbs - ignore what the manual says (it says to have the dealer replace the bulbs). It's very easy to do this yourself.  The rear brake lights seem to be the first to go on Jettas (a little panel with velcro covers a plastic board that holds all the bulbs).

-Experience with dealer service was generally average.  The worst experience was when I brought in my car to a center in Palo Alto, CA at 23K for seatbelt service. They wrote down my info, told me they'd order parts and give me a call.  When I returned for an appt to install the parts, after 24K miles, they didn't have my previous visit on record and said they'd have to charge me $150 to replace a belt...quite an important safety feature, I'd think.  Needless to say, I refused to pay...my seatbelt will remain broken when I return the leased car to the dealer.  

EXTERIOR:
-Tall back end is something to get used to at first.
-Nooks and crannies wheels and doors and front grill are hard to get clean. 
-Windshield can take a beating (random flying rocks on the freeway) without sustaining propagating cracks (I get little circles instead).
-Aesthetically pleasing.
