            We knew we needed a bigger SUV.  Our 1987 Pathfinder was just too small too accommodate our family on our weekend getaways.  We shopped at the Chevy/GMC dealerships certain we would purchase a Tahoe/Yukon.  On impulse, we stopped at the Ford dealership to make sure that we did not want to purchase the Expedition.

We test-drove the 2000 Eddie Bauer 4X4 in the Estate Green, (does it make it worth more to name the colors this way)?  The first thing that struck me was the sheer size of the vehicle.  From the driver's seat, looking back, it appeared that the numbers were meaningless, this thing is HUGE!  I was worried that my wife would not be comfortable driving this vehicle in Los Angeles traffic.  She started the test drive and commented on the power it had.  After just a few minutes, she appeared to be completely at ease maneuvering the Expedition through the tight beach city traffic.

When it was my turn to test-drive it, I immediately was impressed by the power. From my personal seat of the pants power gauge, it had more power than the GM Tahoe/Yukon and was able to deliver the power over a broader range.

Needless to say we left the dealership as new Expedition owners and have had no problems whatsoever with the vehicle.  In 7,500 miles of driving, including city, highway, mountain and tight twisty canyon roads, I have never encountered a situation where the Expedition did not excel.  

The interior is very nicely arranged, although the third seat is better left to the smaller adults and children.  The dual air conditioning unit has always quickly cooled the interior, even on 100-degree desert days.


The premium sound system is nice, but does not have the clarity that I have in my 1996 Nissan Maxima with the Bose system.  Maybe a more powerful amplifier would rectify this.

I spend a fair amount of time off-road with my Expedition. The Eddie Bauer comes with foot rails to make it easier to get into and out of the vehicle.  I thought I would take them off right after I got the vehicle home.  After living with the foot rails for 7 months, I think they are there to stay.  Without them, it would be too hard to climb in while dressed to go out.  They are an annoyance off road, and if you are not careful, you will damage or tear them off in challenging terrain.  For the off road driving I do, it has not been a problem.

There is a definite drawback in owning this vehicle.  Considering the size, weight and power of the motor, it is not surprising that the fuel mileage approaches dismal.  In town, I average 10.8 miles per gallon.  On my most recent camping trip, the average jumped to 13.9 miles per gallon.  I must admit that I drive fast.  On the last trip, I rarely saw the speedometer dip below 80.  Perhaps if I slowed down, the mileage would increase?  I don't think I will ever find out!

If you need a spacious, comfortable SUV, that delivers a car-like ride, and will get you anywhere you want to go, the Expedition is the answer to your need.
