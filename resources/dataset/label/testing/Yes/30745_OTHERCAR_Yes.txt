            I bought the Olympus D-340R about a year ago as my first step into the world of digital photography. I was on a very tight budget, but needed something for my work. I needed to be able to take photos of flaws in metal castings and then E-mail them to my home office for analysis. This meant being able to take close-ups in available light with good resolution.

After doing some research on the net (unfortunately I hadn't discovered Epinions yet), I settled on the Olympus D-340R. The price with the 8MB memory card had just dropped to under $ 300. It included software for downloading photos to your PC along with a serial cable. After taking a few test photos with and without flash, I hooked up the cable to a spare serial port and loaded the software.

Following the instruction manual, I downloaded the photos and was immediately struck with the clarity and the accuracy of the color reproduction. I then tested the &quot;macro&quot; mode for taking close-ups. In this mode you compose through the color screen on the back of the camera, not through the viewfinder. I found that it would automatically focus down to about 4&quot; from the subject. In macro mode it defaults to flash, but you can manually choose no flash. The macro mode was exactly what I needed for work. 

You can choose &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;high resolution&quot; or &quot;super high resolution&quot; and the memory card will hold, respectively, 120, 36, or 18 pictures in each of these formats. I've noticed that the higher resolution isn't any clearer, it just makes the photo larger. In standard resolution, the file size is about 55Kb which is a nice size for sending via E-mail. 

The camera runs on 4 AA alkaline batteries. They don't last as long as I'd like, so I try to keep spares handy. It really doesn't warn you about low batteries until it's too late.

I use this camera for both work and for play. I now use the standard resolution almost exclusively for both. The 1.3 megapixel resolution has been adequate for my needs. The clarity and color reproduction is truly exceptional for an inexpensive camera. It's very easy to use and gives you the ability to view your photos on the small LCD screen on the back of the camera. You can scroll through them and also delete them directly from the camera without needing to download them first.

If you're looking for a good inexpensive digital camera, you can sure do alot worse than the Olympus D-340R. Look at the reviews now for the Olympus D-360L. The newer version for the same price.
