            I traded in my 1998 Lincoln Navigator for a 2003 Land Rover Discovery S.  

<b>RIDE</b>
The new engine on the 2003 Discovery(taken from the old Range Rover) is tons better than the old one.  Compared to my old Lincoln Navigator, the Discovery is way more responsive with better braking ability (not quite Porsche acceleration though).  In addition, the suspension on the Discovery absorbs bumps far better than on the Navigator.  The Discovery follows your every whim on highways with nice tight steering.  The ride is dead quiet.  Land Rover outdid themselves. You can't even hear the engine when you accelerate.<p>

<b>INTERIOR</b>
Land Rovers are a "love it" or "hate it" type of vehicle.  The interior is no different.  I fall into the "love it" category.  I have the alpaca duragrain leather, and it is very comfortable.  Unfortunately, the driver seat does not go back or down enough.  The main problem is with entering and exiting the vehicle.  Your legs have a hard time squeezing past the steering wheel.  I think Land Rover wasted their time putting in "tilt" steering wheel considering it only moves up and down less than one-inch.   Once you do manage to get into the seat, it is very comfortable providing standard adjustments (including lumbar).  You get a great view of the road from up high, although you will have trouble seeing the traffic light if you pull up too close to the white line.  The radio controls are easy to use once you get adjusted (including steering wheel controls).  My last complaint is that the brake and gas pedals are positioned in such a way that it is very easy to step on both of them at the same time.  And now for the good stuff!  The instrument cluster is very clean and classy looking.  There are a million and one nooks and crannies to put anything in.  I highly recommend getting the wood grain package to give it that "luxurious" look.  Entry to the rear seats is kinda tight, but I don't plan on riding back there too often.  Folding the rear seats is a snap.  It gives you plenty of cargo space (more than my old Navigator, but less than some other SUVs...but who really needs 3 more cubic feet of space?).<p>

<b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
Obviously you're not going to get great mileage with an SUV like this; however, it's disappointing that I was able to get better mileage with my much bigger Lincoln Navigator (not to mention the Navigator only needs 87-grade gas, compared to 93-grade for the Discovery).  The new headlights are way cool looking.  Although they are not the new Xenon headlights, they work very well (especially the bright lights).  Interior lighting is adequate for fumbling around in the dark.  The Land Rover key is kind of awkward to put into the ignition (you have to line it up just right).  This is a great looking SUV and you will get plenty of looks (if you're into that).  I am planning on going off-roading this summer, and I can't wait to test out the world-famous Rover off-road capability.  (Since I haven't had it too long, I can't comment too well on reliability, but one month later, it's still running strong)
