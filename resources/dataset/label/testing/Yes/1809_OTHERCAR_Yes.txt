            I just rented a 2001 Dodge Durango SLT for a long work related roadie. Over the course of 3 days, I put over 1400 miles on the truck. I cannot give you any long term information obviously, but hope that this will make your decision to test drive one an easy one. 

I found the truck to be very comfortable. My rental was fully equipped, with heated leather seats, third row of seats, rear control heat/air, Infinity CD/Cassette system, and just about everything else you could want. The seats were comfortable, supportive, and didn't cause any more fatigue then you could expect over an 8 hour trip. Controls were within easy reach for the driver, I especially grew to like the two toggle switches tucked just behind either side of the steering wheel that control the stereo. With them, and without taking your hands from the wheel or your eyes from the road, you can change stations that are preset, scan from station to station, switch radio bands, toggle from radio to CD to Cassette and back, and of course, adjust the volume. Nice feature I wish I had in my Expedition. The cargo area was ample, I transported a 5.5' x 3' x 4' package without too much wiggling. Gas mileage was impressive at 17.5mpg over the course of my trip. This was with the smaller 8 cylinder engine. I'm sure you would lose a few miles if you opted for the larger avaliable 8 cylinder engine. The lil' 8 was responsive, was able to merge fairly well, pulled up the mountains easily, and sounded just a bit throaty. I liked the way it sounded, and caught myself revving a few times for effect. I'd bet the big 8 would be a load of fun on the open road, if geared correctly.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time in the Durango. It was comfortable, roomy enough for the family, or the box, and handled as well as I would have expected. If you are looking for a mid size SUV, like the Explorer, Blazer, or Durango, and the price tag doesn't scare you away, I would certainly pick the Dodge.  <br><br>
