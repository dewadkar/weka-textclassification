            My families first saab was a 1980 Saab 99 in a kind of Puke Orange with an equally dreadful interior, and a 4 speed (maybe a 5 speed).

I was 16, so you have to imagine the true impact of this car. I went to a school where the motor-heads would soup up their novas just so that they could smoke the tires off of them in the parking lot.  And I got to drive the Saab. The greatest aspect of this car was that it's color was a virtue, no-one could take it seriously so when you actually said &quot;Hey, wanna race?&quot; you could get a pretty good bet going. And the cool part was that you could win, because my moms Saab 99 smoked! 

Since then, my family has become a Saab execs dream... I have owned a 900 16valve turbo that I loved, my brother has a 9000, my mother is on her fifth, also a 9-5, and three of her sisters own 9000's or 9-5's

It has been fun to track the changes in the car since GM's involvement began, especially noting the 9000 my mom bought that had the GM engine in it... amazing how much difference there is. SHe has sworn herself to the Saab engine now. 

But anyway, about the car. Saabs blend a unique mix of fun, safety, and luxury. I love the fact that they are NOT so quiet inside that you can't hear the engine rev, I love the fact that they can get through any snow storm (in fact, the only reason I would like 4 wheel drive is for cornering under power). I love them on road trips, and for the acoustics of the cabin. I love the trunk space.

I have owned a lot of cars. I believe that Saabs are among the best of the european luxury sports cars for alot of reasons. My Saab was far more reliable than my Audi, went through snow much better than my BMW (of course). It is fast and fun, and you never have to worry about social status, Saabs have a unique appeal that transcends social position.

The only reason I like Volvo's better is the 4wd.
