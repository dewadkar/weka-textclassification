            The engine, while only a 4-cylinder, provides enough power to merge into heavy traffic, although I tend to attribute this more to the manual transmission. The automatic model I test-drove seemed a tad sluggish, even with the overdrive feature engaged. With a full load of four people plus equipment, acceleration IS rather muted, but a good stick shift can compensate somewhat for this.

The stick shift does have one annoying drawback (or is it a feature?); it sticks (on purpose) between gears, first to second, third to fourth. I guess it's a safeguard from accidentally shifting gears. You really have to put an effort into changing gears, which can be a pain if you're going through stop-and-start city traffic. The automatic version would be a better choice if you know you're going to spend your driving time in urban areas.

Using high gears when possible lets me squeeze about 25-28 miles per gallon, using high-octane juice. Use synthetic oil from the get-go, and you can go forever without fear (you HAVE to put synthetic in from the very start, or else you'll never get its full advantage after switching from regular).

The roll when cornering is more than I've felt from other cars, but using your brain when it comes to making turns is better than having the best safety features.

I like that I can sit a bit higher than other autos, but not so high as a full-sized pickup. Being less than average in height, I don't like having to climb into a vehicle. With the CR-V, I don't have to. It's a good halfway point between ground-hugger, and stilt-mobile.

One DOES have to turn to look when changing lanes, since the blind spot isn't covered by the mirrors, no matter how you tweak them.

The interior layout is fine; everything easy to see and reach, save for the cruise control button. It's up way high and forward on the left-side dash, so I tend to leave it turned on all the time, and engage the CC from the steering wheel control. Storage pockets &amp; compartments seem to pop up everywhere.

The AC comes on nice and quickly, as does the heat. However, the large interior volume means that it'll take a while to warm or cool the entire vehicle. The rear defroster melts ice far faster than I had expected.

Working for an engineering firm, I regularly need to carry all sorts of bulky equipment; the fold-down rear seats and spacious rear are more than sufficient for carrying anything but a refrigerator. One can go from seats-up to seats down in less than 30 seconds (I know, I've timed it..)

I didn't want a car, and I didn't want a truck. I compromised and went with the CR-V. That was nine months ago, and I haven't regretted a single day.<br><br>
