            Before I purchased this camera, I of course checked Epinions!  And the reviews were very positive on this camera from people who had purchased it for the same use that I needed it for.  The only thing that kept popping up was the battery life.  

You see, the Epson PC650 takes AA batteries.  What a convenience!  You don't have to buy odd shaped, very expensive batteries with this camera - making it even more inexpensive to use!  <B>But, I'm pretty sure that energizer was not what Epson had in mind.</B>  I mean, energizers work too and can get you by in a pinch.  But be realistic.  THIS IS A DIGITAL CAMERA!  IT NEEDS SOME POWER!  Epson is not a miracle worker.  It's seems like they are getting negative feedback on a feature that meets the consumer's needs more than any other camera out on the market.

So, I buy some NiMH batteries.  They come in all sizes and work in anything that takes batteries and are RECHARGEABLE! I can take 75 pictures and download them before I have to recharge the batteries!  The batteries are inexpensive.  You can buy 4 batteries and a charger at your local Wal-mart for $20 or check out the auction sites and get them much, much cheaper!

<B>If you buy the camera, save money and purchase the NiMH Batteries and you won't have a gripe about battery life</B>

So, ends my rant about batteries.  I just REALLY appreciated the fact that this camera uses a standard size and then was angered by the bad press associated with their act of consumer convenience.

I purchased the camera from UBID.com for $169.  A great deal!  I came with a serial cable, a Hot shot USB cable, video cable to hook it to your television, a 8MB removable media card, and a hot shot software package to edit photos.

The camera is compact and fits in your hand nicely.  You can take one handed pictures or store it in your purse or any standard size camera case.  My dad has the Sony Mavica and while it has some other features, it is bulky to cart around.  This camera is great to take to the Zoo or other family outings.

It takes pictures in 4 modes all with different levels of compression. The lowest mode is the standard mode which Epson recommends using to take pictures to post on the web.  At this mode, an 8 MB card can hold approx. 91 pictures.   But, if you are taking a picture that is more than 25 feet away, you should use a higher setting.  The camera does not have a zoom feature.  But, if you take a picture with little or no compression, you can zoom in with your computer using the HOT SHOT Software with some good results.

You can set the flash to auto, off, or manual and it also had red eye reduction.

I also like the fact that if you take a horrible picture, you have about 10 seconds to erase it before it even gets written to the disk.  This way you don't have to go through and delete a bunch of bad pictures.  Just push 2 buttons and it's gone.  No switching to play back mode, searching for the picture and then deleting.

It also has a timer!  So you can get in on some of the pictures!

The LCD display can be adjusted.  A lot of times it will look like you took a dark picture from the screen but once you load it to your computer, the picture is fine.  If this happens, you just have to adjust the display, it doesn't affect your picture quality.

It is easy to down load from the smart media cards.  I use the Hot Shot Cable which plugs into a USB port.  In windows explorer, it takes about 60 seconds to transfer 60 pictures! It is also is very simple to erase the card and eject it from the cable.  The smart media card comes with a five year warranty!

This camera is an <B>EXCELLENT</B> purchase if you need it to do family, or everyday, normal things. I take pictures of the kids to e-mail and post on their web pages, I use it to sell junk on E-bay,  I use it just like I would use a normal camera.

I really appreciate the standard size of the camera.  I can use any camera case, any AA battery, and can carry it in my purse.

If you are looking for a digital camera with removable media and a LCD display, I would recommend this to anyone!

If you need it for something is little more involved or technical, go get a super technical, high end camera.
