            The Chevrolet Cavalier is a great car!  My husband and I just bought a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier for our daughter.  We found it to be reasonably priced as well as very sleek looking that both parents and teenagers like.  The car gets good gas mileage and is easy to handle on the road.   The insurance costs on the car are reasonable. We find ourselves making excuses to drive her car!  The car is easy to see out of both in front and back of you.  The side mirrors are easy to adjust appropriately.  I think the car is safer than the &quot;sports-type&quot; cars.  The trunk has a lot of storage space to carry groceries, school books, and a teenager's belongings.  I recommend this car for teenagers and college-age adults that need a good dependable and economical car.  Small families would also like this car for day to day errands and trips.   <br><br>
