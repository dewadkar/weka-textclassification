            We have just sold our 1999 Hyundai Accent.  It was a good car to us until the very end.  There was only one flaw with the car... and it was a very big flaw... it didn't have air conditioning.  That's a mortal sin for an automobile when you live in Arizona and temperatures soar above 100 daily in the summer.  So we had to say goodbye (but we replaced it with a 2004 Hyundai).

Even though we bought the car used, it was still covered by a warrantee when we sold it.  We put about 45,000 miles on the car while we had it.  The warrantee was about to run out, so this was another good time to sell it.  Even though we had a warrantee, we never had to actually take advantage of it.  The car never gave us any troubles.

We did take it into the shop a couple times for non-warantee work, however.  The tires had worn out after a long trip from L.A. to Phoenix and back... we had left the car at our in-laws for a few years while we were living in Italy, and it didn't get much driving while we were gone.  I'm not sure if disuse caused the tires to need replacing or not.  At any rate, we replaced the tires... then we drove over a nail and had to get that patched up.  The only other times we had the car worked on were for routine maintenance and oil changes.  This car was very good to us.

The Hyundai that we bought had manual transmission too (we got a really good deal on it though).  Driving it was a little annoying for me.  I'm pretty short, so I had to push the seat forward almost all the way in order to drive it.  Sometimes it was hard to get out with the seat pushed forward so far.  Dh, on the other hand, is 6'2", and had to push the seat back a fair ways.  The car is small and is missing legroom that you might find in higher-priced cars, so if you are bringing people along to ride in the back seat, you may want to balance out the tall people and the short people.

We had adequate storage and trunk space.  My daughter's full-size stroller could easily fit in the trunk, along with groceries.  Not a Costco-sized load of groceries, but your everyday trip to the store.  If we did go to Costco and pick up stuff, we would normally put the stuff up front with my daughter.  On long trips, we would take the umbrella stroller, as hauling the big stroller was not really compatible with one large suitcase, a smaller suitcase, and a diaper bag.  We were able to carry that and our Christmas presents back on one long-distance trip, but it was a tight squeeze with our daughter and her car seat.

<b>Interior</b>

Sitting in the front of the Hyundai accent was fairly comfortable.  There was a cupholder tray that could be pulled out, that held two drinks.  It would be able to hold most of your standard drinks from restaurants, with a couple of problems.  The larger drinks would not fit unless they had the smaller bases... if you had two larger drinks with smaller bases, the cupholders were so close together they had to tilt a bit to get both drinks in there.

Our car came with a cassette player, so we bought one of those CD adaptors to put in the car.  There was a small space under the cupholders to put a portable CD player, but this posed a small problem: when you had a cup in the cupholder, it was a pain to take the CD player to change the CD.  I would have to take out the drinks first in order to get the CD player out.

The glove compartment could hold a lot of stuff... it was adequately sized.  We could fit a rolled-up US atlas (8 1/2 x 11 sized), our car documentation, 2 plastic theater cups, and a t-shirt in the glove compartment.

<b>Performance</b>

As I mentioned before, the car was absolutely reliable.  We drove it between Washington State, Los Angeles, and Phoenix a couple of times without problems.  I never worried about it once.

My husband sometimes would speed, and I hate to admit that he did have this car at 100mph without any problems before... other than me being scared to death.  If he drove too fast down the freeways, the gas mileage would dwindle a little, but we could still drive between Los Angeles and Phoenix (about 350 miles) on one tank of gas, even at his cruising speed.

The car wasn't the quietest car in the world, especially at higher speeds, but at the same time, you didn't have to yell to hear yourself.

The front was a little low... we would scrape the underside of our car on the curb at our apartments.

On the regular streets, the car was very easy to drive (other than it being manual, which is difficult for me, just because I'm not a good stick driver).  You could easily make U-turns in this car in the city, although if you were on a two-lane highway it could be a little difficult.  Since this car is small, it will fit into almost any compact parking spot (although since we didn't have this car in Italy, I can't tell you if it will fit into a Euro-compact spot, but any of them in America it will).  Our apartment complex had assigned parking, and we need to park between a post on one side, and a Jeep on another side.  I'm not the best driver in the world, but even I could park in our parking spot without turning it into a three-point parking job (something that happened a lot to me when I drove my old 1993 Ford Taurus SHO).

<b>Conclusion</b>

All cars have gone through different histories, but whoever ends up with my 1999 Hyundai will end up with a good, reliable car.  This is not a large vehicle, you're not going to be hauling furniture in this, or want to take a long road trip with four adults either, but if you need a good car to get from point A to point B, this car is a great deal.  The 1999 Hyundai Accent is definitely good value for your money.

We liked this car so much, that when we had to get a new car for the air conditioning, we bought a 2004 Hyundai Accent!
