               My wife and I planned to travel across the USA after I retired in January 2000. We decided that we wanted to trade in our reliable, but getting long in the tooth, 1990 Legacy Wagon. We purchased a 1997 Legacy Outback that only had 14,000 miles on it from our dealer in Glen Cove,NY, North Coast Subaru, and in April, 2000 we set out across the country on a month long trip of 7,650 miles. During our voyage we drove from New York City south to San Antonio Texas, then North West via the Pecos Trail to Santa Fe, New Mexico, then West across to Las Vegas, Nevada, then North to Jackson Hole Wyoming, and finally East across the northern states back to New York.

  During our trip we went from sea level to over 8,000 feet in altitude, and drove through extreme weather conditions. Fierce rain storms in the East, hot 90 degree days in south Texas, dust storms and high cross winds as we crossed Arizona, and finally heavy snow showers in northern Utah.

   Our Outback was sure-footed and stable all the way. The All Wheel Drive system gave excellent traction on all types of driving surfaces, wet, dry, soft gravel on a mountain road, even negotiating an emergency turn into and out of a gully. Never once did our Outback &quot;lose it&quot;.  

   The seats were extremely comfortable making long distance driving a pleasure. The air conditioner worked perfectly during long periods when we were cruising at 75+ miles per hour for hours at a time in high temperatures. The horizontally opposed 165 horsepower four cylinder engine had plenty of punch when we had to enter Interstate highways with traffic including big rigs thundering along at 75-80 miles per hour. 

    The electrically heated front seats were a joy on a cold northern Utah morning as we headed out to our next destination. The car averaged 26-27 miles per gallon during the trip, and it did everything we asked of it. 

     As we neared the end of our trip my wife started calling our car &quot;Good Old Paint&quot;. She was right, because our Outback was as solid and sure footed as a good cow pony.  <br><br>
