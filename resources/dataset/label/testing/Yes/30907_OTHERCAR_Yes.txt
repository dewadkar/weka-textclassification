            I bought my Villager Sport in October 00.  There are some pros and cons about this vehicle.  CONS: The MPG is about 17 in city.  So if you have a lot of stop and go, you might need to stop by the gas station very often. The acceleration is a bit noisy and rough esp. from 0-20.  It also picks up some wind noise when cruising the highway. 

If you have a 2 year old toddler, be careful the door handle will hurt his little fingers. My son can tell you, &quot;it hurts!&quot;  

Getting around the vehicle, esp to the third row seat, is quite difficult in some occasions.
 
The cruise light and the A/C light are so difficult to tell whether they are on or not.   

PROS: I like the style/appearance (the paint, alloy wheel and the luggage rack) of this vehicle. The length of this vehicle is just right for us. (It is longer than the MPV and the short wheel base Caravan.  But it is shorter than the Windstar and Odyssey.)  I still can open the truck door when my garage door is closed. It is also easy to park.  The suspension and brake are great. It is a bright idea to have the net in the cargo area that secure the small items.  

The interior light system is great.  The Sport provides map light and little drawer under the passenger seat. The seat is pretty comfortable.  

Overall, I love my Villager Sport.  I think it is the value that I did the purchase.  I spent a lot of time in researching and went to different dealers for prices.  I also checked the website for rebate.  It was the $3000 Factory rebate caught my attention.  Without that, I might have a second thought.
