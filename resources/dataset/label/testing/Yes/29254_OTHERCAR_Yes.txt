            We bought our S-10 Blazer last year at this time and I still love it.
The great thing about the S-10 Blazer is what a great family vehicle it is.  Getting groceries, just pop the rear window with your keyless entry.
Lots of room in the back.  The back seats fold down for large items.  We
were able to bring home a computer desk which otherwise would have had to
be delivered.  Our boys play baseball and all the gear gets thrown in the back.  Out in a field?  Back it up and put the tail gate down and the large window keeps the sun from beating down on you. Makes a great seat.  We enjoy traveling and the luggage rack and storage in the back ensure you have plenty of room for your belongings.  Another plus, most S-10's come with a towing package.  Perfect for those who want to tow a boat or camper.  We also have 4wd which came in handy this past winter.  While everyone else was slipping and sliding, we were able to mover along quite smoothly and with the anti-lock brakes had no problem stopping on the ice.  Another big plus for us.  We feel very safe driving it.  We purchased the LS model which comes fully loaded (CD player too!)  It's a '95 that was purchased in '99.  It only had 26,000 miles on it and we got an exceptional deal on it.  Under $17,000.00.  As for problems, knock on wood, we haven't had any yet.  Anyone with children, leading an active family life, this vehicle is definitely for you!
