             I've had this car for a little over a year and have had a few problems. The engine has a tick which I suspect to be the valves, since it eventually stops. The windows fall off the track and the paint is faded in some parts, most noticable on the rear wing. The switch for the foglights doesnt stay in by itself I wedged a piece of cardboard to hold it in for now.  Its also a slow car (non-turbo, automatic), particularly at low speed, once you hit 3rd and 4th its ok, but has very little torque for local driving. I installed a new intake, headers and exhaust ($200.00, 150.00, 180.00) and I get better results, after 3000rpm.
 Ive also replaced the timing belts (dohc have 2) as well as the other belts and the waterpump and tensioner-$400.00
 New rims and tires-$1000.00
Soon I will be spending for a new paint job. I hope I dont have to put a computer cause apparently cost over a 1000 bucks for a new one!
 All in all I say it's a good looking reliable car (though it only has 57k miles on it) inside and out, there are alot of aftermarket goodies for it and it handles well, but this should be a 2nd car or for someone who doesnt drive alot of people around cause that back seat is just for show. Oh, and stay away from the 1.8 cause if the 2.0 is low on get up and go, just imagine the smaller engine!
