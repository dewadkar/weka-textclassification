            I originally purchased this truck to as a commuter and to keep unnecessary miles off of my 97 Corvette.  I have been pleasantly suprised by how much I actually like this truck.  I was able to purchase a very clean fairly low mileage (31K) ext cab LS model with the options I wanted from Newark Chrysler Plymouth in May 2002.

After driving my Corvette, the ride is very smooth even without a load in back.  I think they tuned the ride very nicely.  The truck is also remarkably free of squeaks and rattles, although the 3rd door will shake over larger bumps. The seats feel great even for long trips (I can't say this about Ford Rangers) and the material seems to be fairly durable.

I really like two of the standard features, those being the automatic headlights and the accessory power switch that leaves the power on till a door is opened.

I have always liked the appearance of the S-10 trucks from 1998 and on; not flashy, but clean and sharp like a truck should look. I think the LS alloy wheels are some of the nicest OEM's I've seen on any vehicle period.  Although people have complained about the interior materials and appearance, I think it matches the character of the truck quite well.  This is a pickup truck not a luxury car.  The comprehensive gauge package is also nice to see although I wish my truck had a tachometer.

I would best describe the drivetrain performance as adequate.  Although the transmission works nicely, the motor struggles.  This isn't surprising when you consider it has a 120 hp engine trying to haul a blocky 3200 lb vehicle.  When using cruise control the transmission is constantly downshifting to maintain the desired speed and that can get old since it does it frequently.  I recently purchased a K&N air filter and drilled some holes in the stock airbox to help the engine breath a little better and it's made a noticeable improvement in performance.  The only tradeoff has been an increase in induction noise.  I recommend this $40 performance enhancement to anyone who wants more power.

One thing I've also noticed is the pathetic lack of traction in rain, especially on inclines, with my 2WD truck.  The combination of a standard 4.10 rear end ratio, an unloaded bed and the lack of a limited slip differential make this almost inevitable.  I understand why it has such tall gears, but wow it's really hard to get started sometimes.

So far I've driven the truck 5500 miles and am happy to report that I've had no problems.  It's been a great commuter truck that gets reasonable gas mileage 19 city about 25 highway.
