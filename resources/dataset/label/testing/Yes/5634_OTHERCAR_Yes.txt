            <b>What is that thing?</b>

My husband and I were looking to replace our 2000 Cavalier LS. We had been very happy with our little red Chevy and were almost set on getting a new one. Just to compare, we stopped by the Pontiac dealership to look at the Sunfire, when we turned around we got our first glimpse of the Vibe.

"What is THAT?" we asked.

We had seen the Azteks (and laughed at them) before, but this was different. This was smaller, sportier, and a lot better looking. We climbed inside, examined the cargo room, played with the radio, ooed and ahhed at the chrome on the dashboard.

"I'm sure it's WAY more than the Sunfire and Cavalier, though," we thought. But the sticker said 16,900! And the gas mileage! Better than the Cavalier. How can this be? We learned it was the Toyota engineering that made it possible.

<b>Features and stuff<b>

We ended up ordering the Base model with the Moons & Tunes and the Power Package. We added ABS and Automatic transmission. With my GM discount and cash back, the sales price was 17,400.

A disadvantage we found was the six weeks we had to wait for delivery. The cars are so popular that the dealers can't keep them on the lot. But it's worth the wait to get exactly what you want. Don't get the GT or AWD if you don't want it. Don't pay for the extra features that you won't use. Don't let those salespeople sucker you into getting the "Envy" green color.

<b>Moons and Tunes</b>

The 6-speaker stereo is pretty good. I mean, it's not as good as our home theater system, but my opinion is it doesn't sound like a car stereo. (Of course I'm comparing it to the standard stereo in the Cavalier.)

This is our first Moon Roof and we love it! The wind in our hair as we cruise on down the motorway...

<b>Power Package</b>

A must. Power windows, locks, cruise control. They all work great. Weird thing: the remote lock doesn't work when the driver's door is open.

<b>Cargo Room</b>

Okay, it's not a van. I think it holds plenty of stuff. We helped some friends move the first weekend we got the Vibe. They have an Outback. We were able to fit almost the same amount of their crap in our Vibe. However, if you have all the seats up, there isn't much cargo room. There's enough room for groceries, or a weekend camping trip's worth of gear. It suits us great.

<b>Conclusion</b>

We love it. Compared to the Cavalier it has: better gas mileage, way more room, more power, cooler features. And it's not much more expensive. You're gonna love this car.
