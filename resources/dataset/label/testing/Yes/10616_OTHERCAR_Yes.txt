            Ok, I didn't ever think I would be writing a opinion about a product that I purchased. However, after my purchase of my 2000 Leganza CDX, I must let people know what a great car it is, so that everyone goes out and gets one a great deal before Ford ups the price on them. 

I purchased this car back in Feb 2000. I had been reviewing this car via the internet for a couple of years prior and it's successes in other countries. All faired well in those countries and then it hits the US market. It took a while for it to come to Dallas, Texas but when it did, I was out there test driving them along with other models i.e. Galant, Accords, Camry, Saturn. After much test driving, searching auto reviews, personal reviews around the world etc I finally decided to make the purchase. Today, I am still SOOO GLAD that I purchased this car versus any others. 

The main reason is the value and what you get for your Dollar. This car comes with every option you can think off and paid less than $20,000. Plus, it comes with a 3 year maintenance free warranty. I have recently taken the car in for its normal oil change and had the best customer service and to be able to drive away without paying a dime for the service was AWESOME ! 

I recently have taken some road trips up to Oklahoma about 250 miles from Dallas on the weekend and this car drives SMOOTH. It's cool to pass up all the other cars, while enjoying the GREAT 6 CD/CAR STEREO SYSTEM. The Stereo System is AMAZING and very loud with so many options to the system. 

In addition, we are in the summer months now in Texas and let me tell you it has gotten as high as 103 degrees. Yet, even with such high temperatures and my weekend road trips the AIR CONDITIONER system on this 4 cylinder car exceeds my expectations. The AUTO AIR feature ensures consistent and constant cold air throughout the entire car. This is the first car in awhile that I have owned that has provided actually COLD AIR not cool air DURING the HOT summer months. 

I still get pulled over as I drive, pumping some gas from people curious to know what kind of car it is and how nice it looks. It's always funny to me, when I tell them it's a DAEWOO, it never fails they say DAE WHOOO??
Then when I tell them how satisfied and how smooth the car drives and to top it all how much I paid, they don't believe me. 

I DEFINITELY would recommend this to anyone who is seeking a nice looking, reliable, sporty looking, classy, all option type car at a economical price. YOU WON'T BE SORRY..... I can honestly say that I am glad that I traded in my Mitsubishi Galant ES for my new Leganza CDX. 

Finally, I am not a sales person or anything of the sort. I am just a truly satisfied consume with a purchase of the Leganza CDX. If anything, I would ask that you at least give it a test drive and let it make the decision for you. 

If anyone has any questions from me about this vehicle and my personal experience thus far, feel free to email me at
