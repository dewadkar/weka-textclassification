            After driving everyone else's cars for years I finally bought my very first car in January of this year, and I have never been happier.

After a lot of shopping around for an affordable used car this was the gem that I decided upon. I wanted a car that was under $5000, reliable with good gas mileage and that I would be able to sell again, and this is definitely it.

The weekend after I bought the car I took it for a run out to Yosemite from San Francisco and it ran perfectly. After only four months I have driven over 7000 miles and I have never encountered any problems. 

The car runs smoothly, the brakes are sharp and the clutch is very responsive. The gas mileage is normally between 350 and 400 miles per tank, which I think is outstanding for city use.

I would recommend this car to anyone considering a reliable and good value low cost used car.
