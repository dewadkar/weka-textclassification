               <b>H</b>aving grown tired of losing sales to Infiniti, (Nissan's Luxury line), Lexus ( Toyota's Luxury line),  Mercedes, and BMW, Cadillac decided to launch an attempt at an assault in the form of the Seville Touring Sedan, also known as the STS. Redesigned for 1998, and revised again for 2001, the latest version is the best yet.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

      <b>F</b>orget everything you thought or heard about old Cadillacs, the STS represents a new direction for General Motors premium brand. This Heavy-weight luxury cruiser can sprint to 60 MPH in just 6.8 seconds (according to specs), and has a top speed of 155 MPH (according to specs). The Northstar V8 is very smooth, and offers loads of torque for great hill climbing. One should note however that even though the Northstar V8 is smooth it is not as refined as the V8 in the Lexus LS 400. The four-speed automatic shifts are seamless and very precise. The sophisticated multi-link <b>suspension</b>, with its adaptive damping deals easily with harsh road surface's, and the rack and pinion steering provided immediate response to sudden turns, etc.

    <b>C</b>adillac's Northstar 4.6 liter DOHC V8 was produced in response to the brilliant Lexus and Infiniti V8s, Launched in 1992 ( First seen in the Cadillac Allante), it is of all alloy construction, and has 4 valves per cylinder which are opened via four chain driven overhead camshafts. Fuel is fed through multipoint injection (by the way this car gets around 27 mpg highway)and like many luxury cars, there is an individual ignition coil for each cylinder. A special "Limp Home" mode enables the car to be driven up to 60 miles just in case you lose all your engine coolant.

  The chassis and <b>suspension</b> systems are superb, the STS boasts 4 wheel independent suspension with all-speed traction control that integrates brake and engine management systems.. This is all part of the Northstar system. Like so many think Northstar is just about the engine, well its not, it the whole brain of the car. The STS comes with 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS. The STS has a continuously variable road-sensing suspension with computer controlled Stabilitrac 2.0 stability enhancement system.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> of the STS, while not BMW 7 Series material, is very luxurious. You'll find loads of amenities, such as Onstar, which uses GPS, (global positioning system) which connects the driver via satellite to an onstar advisor, A boombing Bose 4.0 music system, power automatic programmable locks with central locking, dual zone electronic climate control, & so many other features it would take forever to tell you about them all. The STS boasts plenty of head and leg room for 5 adults, and the quality of the seats are high grade and very comfortable. One thing I really liked about the STS's interior was the lack of fake wood. Unlike many cars that are loaded to the brim with this type of plastic, the STS is very modest with the wood accents.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 
   
The <b>exterior</b> is handsome, but its no Brad Pitt. It won't turn as many heads as say a Jaguar S-type (which is in the same price range, and is just as fast in V8 form than the STS). The grille is kinda plain, no chrome this year. There is a wide range of colors and wheels to choose from. My favorite color for the STS is 'Sable Black,' But a new 'Blue ONYX' should be available soon, if not now. The Wheels of choice are the 7 spoke optional rims which are cast aluminum with chrome finish.


<i>Pricing:</i>

  The <b>Price</b> is fair for this car, personally I'd take a Jaguar S-Type or even a 3.0 X-type, or GS 400 by Lexus over this car anyday, but that's just me. The Seville STS is  a lot of car, but you pay a high price for everything you get; tipping the scales at around $52,000 with all options.

<b>Other Cars To Consider:</b>

<i>1. Jaguar S-Type
2. BMW 5 series
3. Lincoln LS
4. Lincoln Town Car
5. Chrysler 300M
6. Mercedes S-class
7. Jaguar XJ8
8. Cadillac CTS
9. Volvo S60
10. Acura TL</i>

-Happy Car shopping!
