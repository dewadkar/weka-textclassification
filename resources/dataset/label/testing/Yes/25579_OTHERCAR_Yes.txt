            We have owned a 1997 Z3 for over three years now.  The car has been perfect. No problems, simple maintenance and a joy to drive.  The finish is perfect, 5 speed shifts great, gauges are simple but appropriate and the interior is appropriate. Roof is easy to lower and raise.  The car still gets a lot of attention and has no faults to speak of.  Although trunk space is VERY limited, its not the kind of car you want to take a long trip in.  Gas mileage is in the low 20 mpg range and although a lot of people will cringe, we follow the oil change guidelines (6000 miles plus, wait until light come on)

We were only able to get the 1.9L at the time but its still fun to drive.

A real &quot;Fun To Drive Car.&quot;
