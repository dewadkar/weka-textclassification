            I recently went out with my wife to search for a replacement vehicle for my 2002 BMW 4.6is X5.  I hated that car.  Everything that was promised (as close to an M model the X5 will get) was unfulfilled.  Anyway, we went to the local Infiniti dealership to look at a curious vehicle known as the FX45.  I had seen some ads on TV and was intrigued with the cars overall presence and design.  I must say, the commercials don't do it any justice!  

Upon first glance, the vehicle's stance is one of power and poise, promising to be a driver's delight.  The car actually looks smaller that it really is, providing more than adequate room for my wife and I and our two year old.  

The sales man drove the car first and showed us some the features that the car had.  The VDC test was amazing.  If you go out and test this vehicle, be sure to ask your sales person to demonstrate it for you.  When I got behind the wheel I was amazed at the amount of power immediately available.  My X5 couldn't compete.  I took a quick trip around the corner and went back to the dealership.  I was sold!  Now the only hard part was deciding on options and color.

I really liked the Diamond Graphite with the Brick and Black interior.  It's a little different without being too outlandish.  We chose the Technology package, as it adds the navigation system and DVD entertainment system (a must have for anyone with a child). 

All in all, I must say I was surprised at the level of service we received both before and after the sale.  I never received the same level of treatment at the local BMW dealership.  I am sold on Infiniti products, I hope that you will be too.
