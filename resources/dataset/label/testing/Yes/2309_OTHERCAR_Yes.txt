<TEXT>
            I bought my Kia Sephia on July 1st 1999, after reading a great deal on the Kia website and getting information from other sources I feel I have made a good choice. I am single and therefore on one income. I needed a quality car with good gas mileage and lots of extras but without the hefty price tag of most other car makers. My Kia has all the extras I was looking for, CD player, power windows/locks, AC, and many safety features like the dual airbags and child safety locks on my back doors, and a control to limit a childs ability to use the power windows. I called Kia 3 or 4 times before I made my choice of cars, they were great giving my information that I could use and explaining everything about their product. For under $14,000 this car gives everything all the big names do, even if you have to tell people that Kia makes the Kia Sephia it's worth it!!!!<br><br>
