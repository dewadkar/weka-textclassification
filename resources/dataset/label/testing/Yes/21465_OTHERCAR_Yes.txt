            In the beginning was the Samurai, a small, underpowered but rough and ready off-roader. Then came the Sidekick which added a touch of creature comfort and some excellent design ideas but lost a ton of character. (I owned one of each of these). The Vitara and Grand Vitara were steps upward for Suzuki with added size, comfort and convienience. But it is the XL-7 that takes Suzuki into the mainstream of the booming SUV market.

The XL-7 is basically a Grand Vitara with about 10 inches added to its wheelbase and an even greater extension to the cab length. Those extra inches not only make the XL-7 a much roomier vehicle, but also a much more comfortable one for interstate cruising.

The third row of seats is only of partial value, for while the seats themselves are well shaped and quite comfortable, there is little leg room available. For a growing family with small children, however, it'd be a boon. And the fact the the second row of seats is fore-aft adjustable adds to the flexability.

The long wheelbase of itself smooths out the XL-7's ride a great deal in comparison to other mid-sized SUVs. And add to that the Suzuki's complient long-travel suspension and you have a really comfortable tourer. But, since the XL-7 -- unlike most 2nd generation SUVs -- is built on a truck-type ladder frame, the machine still has true off-road capability.

The V6 motor is quite adaquate for long uphill passages as well as 2-lane passing while still alllowing good gas mileage (We've been averaging 24 mpg on trips). 

With the seats folded down the XL-7 has tremendous carrying capability. And both the 2nd and 3rd row seats have split folding capability which allows for great flexibility in using that space.  Sadly, though, the rear seats are not removable and the seats, when folded, do not make for a truly flat deck. That is something that Suzuki should re-think.

The interior materials used in the XL-7 are a big step up from earlier Suzukies but are not yet quite equal to those found in more expensive models. And ergonomics are onlly fair.  Still, the vehicle makes a wonderful traveling companion and, if my experience with earlier Suzukies is typical (My Sidekick lasted 13 years with almost no care and little regular service) that'll be true for many a mile.
