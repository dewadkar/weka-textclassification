            See Bottom for updated review:

1200 kms (that's 700 miles for you Americans) into the lease on this new Outback.  

After kind of getting the car by mistake (the Forester I dealt on became unavailable) I am really happy with it.  Mind you, I am coming from a longish lease on a '97 Chevy Blazer, which had grown less likeable as we moved into a very large city.

The Outback is nimble and fun to drive.  People complain about lack of power, but my 165hp four mated to the 5-speed seems like plenty.  I guess we have become harder to please in terms of horsepower.  It handles well, zips around corners and is very easy to drive.  Compared to the Blazer, the mileage is a breath of fresh air.

cons:  I am picky about car audio, but as I get older I find myself wanting a good factory setup rather than going into the secret world of the car audio shop.  This system seems slightly underpowered, and the speakers are decidedly boomy.  This works good for some discs, but can make others a little nasty.

I felt a bit sheepish getting involved with a car that had that Paul Hogan guy as the spokesman.  He is so Hokey I find him an anti-incentive.  I have feared being jibed for my choice of a down-under mobile or something.  I would hate to have to subdue a friend for their poor choice of material to rib me about.

Engine at Highway speed:  When you first get the car up to and beyond 60 mph, it makes what could first be taken to be a disturbing or unsettling throbbing noise.  Then after you have cruised for just thirty seconds or so, you realize that this is just how this boxer four is going to sound on the highway.  You soon forget the sound, and find it delightful how poised this car is at 70 or 80 mph (not that I would ever drive that fast, officer)

All round, I like the car a lot so far.  Lots of space for stuff, stout roof rack, comfy seats, AMAZING A/C, wonderful safety and convenience features.

Update:

I have had this vehicle for 18 months and 36,000 Kms now.  I would have to say that I am now more impressed with the car than ever.  We have put lots of miles on it both highway and city, and it jest seems that you can do nothing to unsettle this little wonder of a car.  It will go on the highway just as fast as you like and never complain, or tool around town  briskly, easily and with little effort to drive.  Early in 2003 I installed a trailer hitch and started towing a 1700 lb fishing boat package.  The car still wants to go just as quickly as you like, even with the boat attached.  However MILEAGE SUFFERS TERRIBLY when you drive too quickly with the boat on the back.  I have found that one wants to keep the speed limit in sight if wanting to get acceptable mileage while towing.  However, as the car is so willing, it is sometimes hard to do so.

The car after this amount of mileage is still very tight, steering and suspension still feel new, doors close perfectly, windows and latches operate perfectly, there are no rattles, squeaks or anything like that to report.  

Reliability has been perfect, save one brake rotor that warped, and was a bit difficult to diagnose. 

The greatest thing is that for a little station wagon, this car is just so much fun to drive! 

I have recommended the car to everyone that will listen.  Way to go Subaru!
