            I got this car brand new in late 1997, I have absolutely loved it ever since.  They are so very easy to modify and make ridiculously fast, as well . . .

I have plenty more information about my car at http://lilviv.com/supra including all the modifications I've done to it, timeslips, etc.

The car ran 12.96 in the 1/4 on stock tires with stock catalytic converters on the car.  With just an intake and free modifications it ran 116.3 through the traps in the 1/4 mile, which is fast . . . since with some more happy modifications, it runs 118 mph through the traps and runs 12.4 on street tires with plenty more to go . . .

The motor for this car seems to be indestructable, and it seems to be the best invesment I've ever had part of.

The cons I listed above are cons I was able to live with easily, I would've preferred a two seater, but it seems to be pretty convenient at times to have some extra space back there, and it helps for insurance purposes, as well.  I think it shouldn't have an ashtray, because nobody should smoke in such a beautiful car, but it should have a cupholder for long trips. =)

I wanted to buy a Viper for the longest time, but had the opportunity to drive one in the recent past, and decided that the Supra Turbo was so much more refined, quicker as I modified it (and beat it in a race), and much more . . . although this car may not get the looks and attention a Viper does, I'm happy to stay ahead of them at the races, etc.

I also get great gas mileage combined with its great driveability.

Not to mention the Supra Turbo is an excellent road racing car as well to take to the track . . . it not only kills at the street races, but Andi B. recently won the Texas Triathalon (Races) for the Super Street class on stock turbos!  He beat Ligenfelter built Vettes, Huge Turbo RX-7's, all the Vipers, etc.  Nuts.  http://www.boostaholic.com

I don't know how much more to rave about this car, I love it so much . . . it's about "perfect."  Go Toyota MotorSports!
