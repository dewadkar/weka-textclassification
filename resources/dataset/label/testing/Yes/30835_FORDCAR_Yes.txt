            I bought this vehicle in 1992 -- it was a used 1991 Explorer with 40,000 miles on it, 4-door, automatic and was not a 4x4. At the time, I not only needed a &quot;new&quot; car, but needed a larger one. It fitted my criteria very well.

I love my Explorer!  As of this date, Dec. 18, 1999, it has been through one rear-ender (fixed up beautifully by the Ford Company) and has 160,000 miles on it with little up-keep.  I make sure I have an oil change every 3 months without fail because I travel often. 

This car has never had an oil leak and has not been plagued by any of the motor failings my other cars have had. The air condition does not work very well as of this date and in hot weather it is uncomfortable. They tell me that it needs to be replaced. This is the only thing I have had a steady problem with. 

It is roomy and comfortable to ride in, with the rear seat folding down when you need more room in the back or a place to sleep when you are traveling. I enjoy it particularly that the Explorer acts like a truck but feels and drives as a comfortable and roomy car.  Holds the road in rain or snow; can hardly feel if the wind is blowing; gets good gas mileage; and takes minimal upkeep. Love it!!!!

When I am ready to buy another, it will be an Explorer.
