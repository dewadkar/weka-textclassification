            This vehicle was given to me by my parents when I turned 16. It is a pretty nice car. I know some would complain, mainly because their parents buy them 15-20,000 dollar cars. But this car has done me well. It has had it's share of problems, recently a heating gasket broke and that had to be replaced and the heater has broken and it's had some other middle of the road problems, but it's quite a sporty sedan car. It has nice acceleration, is a little jerky in the turns, but that's probably because mine is 7 years old and has around 139,000 miles on it. It has been somewhat expensive to maintain in it's older years, but what isn't huh? This is a nice car for a 3 or 4 person family, and the newer sables look even sleeker than ever. If I had to get a new car for under 16,000 right now, a new sable or taurus would be my choice.<br><br>
