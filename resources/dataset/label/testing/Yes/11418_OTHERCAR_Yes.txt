            What a pleasure it is to get in my new 4 Runner each day.  I bought it because I spend a great deal of time driving to many appointments each day, and I needed an attractive, reliable and fun vehicle.  I just love it when I  leave an appointment and head towards the parking lot to get in my new 4 Runner.  It looks great and drives like a comfortable truck.  It is spacious and the CD player makes those trips between appointments really enjoyable. The heater gets blasting very quickly and in no time it is comfy-warm in there. The 4 doors make it convenient when transporting friends or clients, and the trunk area is spacious for cargo, groceries, or even a bicycle! Great Vehicle! <br><br>
