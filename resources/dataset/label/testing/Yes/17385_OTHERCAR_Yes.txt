            The 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse RS is one awesome ride!  Whether you are looking for speed, style, or affordability you get it all in one package with this bad boy.

If you are looking for speed without having to worry about refilling your tank every 35 miles, this is the car for you.  I can be rolling at about 80 mph, step on the gas and STILL feel it pull away!  Now remember this is only a 4 cylinder engine.  Which brings up another good point, with todays soaring gas prices who wants to &quot;fill it up&quot; all the time?  I like a nice little un-interrupted drive sometimes, and with this baby I can get it.

Next, we are going to talk about handling.  If you want a car that can take you on hairpin turns doing 115 mph... well that's a little much for the Eclipse, but you can easily scream around turns at 80 or 90 with no worries what-so-ever.  This car will hug the road and I don't think that there is a more comfortable ride out there.

Lastly I am going to tell you buy this car because of the price.  I mean come on!  Good cars in today's market sell for at least 30 grand, right?  Wrong!  This is one car that will treat you and your bank account right.

If you don't have an Eclipse, I highly recommend picking one up... hey I did.<br><br>
