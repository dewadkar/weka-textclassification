            Actually, I never bought this vehicle, my husband did before we were married and for a while it was okay. Then we got married, had to move a ways away from where he worked and man did it suck up GAS! We were forking over about 180 a month for gas prices. That was the biggest downfall. The second one was that it seemed to be a magnet for people to want to key and flatten our tires. No, I am not talking about nasty neighbors that hated us. It was just random people that happened to dislike our truck for some reason. 

The finer points about the truck was that it in fact was a truck! What I mean is you could pick up furniture and all that and not worry about it being delivered or anything. That is one of the big things we miss about it. Also, the Dodge had a lot of power and it could beat out any idiot on the road. Some parts of me still miss it since we traded it in for a family vehicle. 

These trucks aren't so bad, unless you do a lot of traveling and have more than one kid. Those are the people that shouldn't buy this truck. Everyone else is welcome to it!<br><br>
