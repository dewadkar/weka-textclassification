            I got this new camera as a present from my husband for my birthday.  Already an enthusiastic digital camera owner, I thought I didn't need a new one but this proved me wrong. The best little camera I have ever owned.  
Hubbie said he bought it because it was so light and easy to use. He was fed up of me saying "I wish I had brought the camera" and thought this would get more use.  He is so right.
A good ladies camera, I can keep it in my handbag and pull it out when its needed rather than missing those one off shots.  You can also voice tag your pictures through the camera.  I had great fun at Christmas recording peoples reactions to seeing their pictures.
Download is easy and the software is comprehensive enough for manipulation without tears.
Battery life is good but I suggest a second battery to keep charged.  You have to remove the battery to charge it unless you buy an adaptor.  This puts the camera out of action for an hour or so while the battery charges.  Sods law says it will run out in the middle of a party or those golden moments will happen when the battery is on charge.
Expansion card is a must as camera memory only holds 9 HQ pics.  Careful what card you buy, go for a known name.  Our first one was faulty and would only let me download from the USB and not from a reader. Gone for a better make second time round.  Worth the extra few quid.
The camera has remote facility but no remote included.  Its always a bit sad when you need to buy extras to use the facilities supplied with the camera.
Don't let this put you off though.  The camera is great.
