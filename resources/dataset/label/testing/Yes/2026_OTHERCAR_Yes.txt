            I purchased my 2000 Grand Marquis from Towne Lincoln Mercury, Inc. in West
Seneca, NY in April, 2000.  To date, I now have about 4,250 miles on it.  
I am in my mid-60's and do not drive all that much and have given up on taking long trips (my wife is a semi-invalid..she does not enjoy traveling
anymore).  The longest drive I have made in this car is a 200 mile jaunt to Honeyoye Lake in the Rochester area.  I would rate the ride in the Grand Marquis as very smooth and quiet on the &quot;open road&quot;, however, it does leave something to be desired when going over a rough or badly worn
road surface..railroad tracks really bring out the less flattering ride
characteristics of this car.  I talked to a service advisor about this
&quot;problem&quot; when I had the car in for its' 3000 mile service and he told me
that other customers had mentioned the same observations.

This is (so far) about the only undesirable performance criteria I can find.  I had leather upholstery installed &quot;after-market&quot; and highly
recommend that item to any interested buyers.  If I could have found the
&quot;right&quot; car on the dealer's lot with leather seats, I could have saved
about 300 bucks..factory price on the sticker is about $700.

Fuel economy is not spectacular, but is good for a mid-sized luxury car;
I'm now getting about 17mpg doing mostly suburban driving running errands,
post office trips and grocery shopping.  Overall, I am pleased with my
new Mercury and recommend it to anyone looking for an attractive (in my
view) reasonably-priced, full sized car.
