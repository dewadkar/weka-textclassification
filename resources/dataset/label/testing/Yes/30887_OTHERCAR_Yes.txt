            When my wife started looking for a car the appearance and exterior color where her primary concerns (as well as having power steering). We also wanted something which we could use to haul stuff from Home Depot back to our house.

The Toyota Tacoma was a lead candidate, but we took a closer look and did not like it. Her previous car was a Honda, and she really liked them so we looked at the Honda Odyssey, and liked it, but could not get over the fact that it is a mini-van... Then we saw a commercial on TV for the Element, and decided to take a closer look at it, and ended up buying it.

It's appearance is quite striking, someone compared it to a cross between a Hummer and a Mini - boxy but small. It has some unique features which make it a nice vehicle, although luxury is certainly not one of the design concerns.

While driving down the road we still get a lot of stares, and people pointing trying to figure out what the car is - which is a neat feeling.

<b>Handling:</b>
The element handles fairly well. It is an SUV, and therefore suffers some of the body roll issues for emergency manouvers and tight corners, but it is not as severe as some other vehicles I have driven.

With 4-wheel disk brakes, the car can stop quite effectively, and ABS standard makes it stop quite well in most conditions.

Part-time all-wheel drive is nice, but you have no idea of when it is engaged - the computer engages the rear wheels when it senses wheel slippage in the front wheels, but there is no indication on the dash of it happening. I have not had a chance to try it on really slippery roads to see how it performs.

<b>Engine:</b>
Only available as a 4 cyl (albeit an iVTEC 4 cyl) it has adequate power to get going, but not in too much of a hurry. During acceleration the engine has to be streched to get the best of it - and it can get pretty loud. At cruising speed on the highway, the engine is quiet enough to go on road trips without discomfort.

With that said, it would be nice if Honda made the Element available with a 6-Cyl engine.

<b>Interior:</b>
The materials used for the Element are easy to maintain, ranging from the rubber flooring to the easily washable seat covers. 

The interior is designed with an active lifestyle in mind, so that when you have gone out on that muddy mountain bike trail you dont mind about getting mud inside the car, cause you can wash it right out.

<b>Sound System:</b>
This is probably the best factory installed sound system I have heard - without going to the audiophile systems installed in BMW or Infinity cars.

With a 7 speaker system including a subwoofer the radio can put out some good bass.

<b>Seats:</b>
This is one of the most unique features of the element. The seat configurations. The seats both front and back can be folded down completely flat and make a reasonable sleeping surface. 

The rear seats can also be folded up into the side and held up using a carabiner attached to the seat. This gives us a considerable amount of carrying capacity. The rear seats can be taken out altogether (although we have not needed to yet.

<b>Overall:</b>
A great little car, with some nice touches, although sparsely appointed.
