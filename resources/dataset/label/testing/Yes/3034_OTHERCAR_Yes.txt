            Everyone loves driving the my Mercedes C280 especially car nuts.  I bought this car second hand from a leaseholder who found it too small to ferry commercial real estate buyers.  However, it is plenty spacious for average passengers and a is great touring car.  I have had no problems and little expense with this car. It has over 90,000 miles now and feels and looks like new. Three years ago this car won first prize in a local car show, in the German category against many exotic sports cars. 

I bought the car because my husband and son are Mercedes fanciers and they suggested this model.  At the time, I had to search in nearby cities as there were no C280s for sale in our area.  I would buy the new Mercedes C280 if I weren't so happy with the 1994 model.  

I drove it to work for four years and we took family trips several times to the midwest with no problems.  My only complaint is Mercede's performance on ice and snow.  Winter tires would be a requirement if we lived in a frigid climate.  Also, some of the little luxuries such as seat memory did not come on this model.  However, the seat adjustment is a dream.  

The car is spacious for the large driver.  My husband is a foot taller than I am and we are both comfortable driving this model. It may be a tight squeeze for 300 pounders but they are still comfortable. 

Small repairs can be expensive.  The digital outside temperature gauge and the digital time went out but my husband who is NOT mechanical fixed both with new parts.

Owning a Mercedes also makes you eligible to join your local Mercedes club which will get you discounts on service and parts as well as social events and services such as the driveway mechanics get togethers.  There is also a Internet site with instructions on how to do your own repairs, etc.  Check with Mercedes Agency for contacts for the club.  The club is also your route to special events around the country such as rallyes, car shows, day trips, and other driving fun.
