            I was in the market for a new vehicle as my 93 Grand Caravan was getting to the point of needing a lot of maintenance. Also, I no longer need quite as large a vehicle as most of my driving since retiring was around town and Grand Caravans don't get that great a mileage around town. I had got quite used to the elevated drivers position in the Caravan so I decided that I would look at mini SUV's. I checked out every small SUV made and tested most of them. They ranged in price from about $14000 (Kia) to $20000+ (Honda CRV). I fell in love with the Vitara. It drove great, had enough power and great gas mileage. In comparing all models in this range there is no comparison for comfort, great gas mileage and just all around fun, especially when you consider that it is so economically priced (15000 - 19000) depending on equipment. This is the perfect car for young people, commuters and especially empty nesters. I wholeheartedly recommend it. <br><br>
