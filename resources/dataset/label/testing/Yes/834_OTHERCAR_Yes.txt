            Before I begin my review, let me say that I live down the road (literally) from HP here in Southwest Washington. I feel a little biased about having this great company in my neighborhood.

So, when it came time to get a digital camera I fell back on my favorite brands. Sony, HP, etc. caught my eye immediately. I came to epinions. I read the reviews. I went to Circuit City and spoke with an employee. Heck, I even cornered my coworkers to ask them about their cameras. 

I got too many reviews from too many brands... and nothing was very consistent. Well, all but the HP 618. The reviews were excellent (both on epinions and other sites) and the guy at Circuit City let me play with theirs before I bought it.

What they didn't tell me was that the software needed to download the pictures STINKS, and that it has many many problems interacting with popular programs that exist on most computers.

What they also don't tell you in the store (until you go to buy) is that it doesn't come with a case or accessories. So, I ended up forking over an extra $50 just for the case and extras. That doesn't include buying more memory. The 16mb memory that comes with the camera lets you take about 29 pictures.  ::twirling finger:: 

So, let me break it down in two ways. First the review of the camera:

PICTURE QUALITY:  This is a 2.1 megapixel camera, so the quality of the photo is pretty good. Depending upon your photo imaging software, you can take standard candid shots or more professional pictures and clean them up the way you like. I did not purchase my camera for anything more than family events, so I am very happy with the picture quality.

EASE OF USE:  Well, it'll never be as easy as a disposable Kodak, but I don't find myself having any problems. The picture display is not as large as some other cameras, but the image is clear and easy to read. The buttons are not difficult to operate (and this is important for those non-technical camera operators who can never find the right button to push.) The batteries and memory card are also easy to get in and out.

WEIGHT: No, it's not too heavy! YAY!

STYLE: Well, it's silver and black. Silver and black are in.

BATTERY LIFE: The batteries are from Sept. 13th and died as I was writing this review on November 2nd. My use was standard, so that's a good indication of how long the batteries last.

And here is the 2nd part of the review... The Software.

Ick. That's about all I can say. If everything works correctly, the image editing software is so-so, very standard and easy to use. However, I have many technical glitches, and this software crashes all the time. The HP tech that I spoke with says this is a common problem. In fact, I had to call HP before I could upload the pictures to my computer after the FIRST use. He said that was also common.

So, ick.

Otherwise, the camera is sweet, and if you are lucky you can find it below the cost of $300.00.
