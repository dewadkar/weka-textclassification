            I researched the Ford Explorer for many months.  As a smart shopper and on a budget, I wanted the most for my money.  I live in a rurual area with  unpredictable winters, and I needed a realiable vechicle. I knew Ford has been making quality cars and trucks for many years and was sure a Ford truck was what I wanted.
After I test drove the Explorer, I knew this was the truck for me!  Being a small woman  I was concerned that an SUV would be too big for me to handle. But the Explorer Sport was perfect! Not only did it handle great, the inside is roomy with comfortable seats and adjustable seat belts, which definitely suits a small person. Even though I bought a standard model, nothing in this truck is less the great. (dual airbags makes this great even greater)  It is great for weekend getaways with lots of cargo space. It drives sturdy and I feel 100% safe in this truck.  
I could go on and on.  Anyone looking for a great deal for your money should buy a Ford Explorer!
