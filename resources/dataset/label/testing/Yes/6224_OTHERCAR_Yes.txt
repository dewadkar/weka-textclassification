            My 2000 Nissan Frontier was purchased out of necessity.  I had an aging 1990 Dodge Omni and needed reliable basic transportation as replacement.  At the time I was considering the Toyota Echo, the Ford Focus, and the Nissan Sentra.  I had not considered the purchase of a truck due to price and the need to hall kids back and forth to school.  While visiting the local Nissan lot in search of Sentras, I happened upon the promotion of the week.  It was a 2000 Nissan Frontier XE king cab, with air, and cassette, for 11,999.00.  A king cab at this price sparked my interest and I took a test drive.  The truck has adequate power for a 4 banger. The fit and finish is tight, although the rear seats seam flimsy.  The view of the road is high.  Headroom, as with most trucks, is great for six plus foot adults.  The rear seats were meant only for small kids.  Adults will have to perform like Houdini to escape from the rear of this truck.  The XE package is adequate.  The five speed gives the truck more get up, but takes up a large portion of the middle passengers legroom, and there is not much.  I recommend tilt steering for six plus footers, as the steering wheel will block the view of gauges.  The automatic is a necessity for driving in traffic.  The five speed will increase the size of your left thy with a considerable workout in long traffic jams.  The dealers have a plethora of add on goodies for this vehicle.  I recommend sticking with the basics and adding on options after the buy.  I have found a great number of accessories, both Nissan and aftermarket, on the net.  The price is about half what the dealer charges for these.  This would include: bed liners, CD players, floor mats, fender trim, pen stripe, trailer hitch, etc.  Over all this is a good basic truck and an outstanding deal.<br><br>
