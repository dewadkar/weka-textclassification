            Dodge Durango 1999 SLT 5.9 Loaded

Supporting its excellent looks (chunky, solid front end reminiscent of larger Dodge trucks), this vehicle delivers performance to the same standards.  With the 5.9 litre engine filling the engine compartment, yet looking tidy and with all necessary top-ups easy to spot and reach, there is enough power for most tasks as well as rapid acceleration when needed.  Luggage and people capacity is excellent, despite the relatively high floor.  This did make it hard for my two dogs (St Bernards) to jump in - ever tried lifting a 15o pound dog into the back of an SUV?

Some small downsides to beware of.  Tires seem to wear incredibly quickly and will cup if not rotated (and may even do so then).  Oil changing isn't as simple as it could be because removing the filter is tricky and often spills oil onto the frame which drips for a day or two.  The engine/transmission can also be a bit noisy, but then that adds to the experience!  The third row of seats are useful, but restrict load space so that they're not useful for picking up the family at the airport if they also have suitcases!

Driving this vehicle is fun and is frequently the envy of many others.  You'll be stopped many times and asked how you like it, especially at filling stations.  You will become very familiar with those as the vehicle is thirsty - averaging 14 mpg with mixed driving.  The four wheel drive in winter in Michigan is excellent and very safe.  Steering is positive, braking is sure and the suspension is just hard enough to allow good feel of the road yet soft enough to make it feel like an SUV and not a truck.

Overall, I'll buy another one, but for now need more space to carry the dogs and their paraphenalia.  Dodge support through my dealer was also very good, not that much was needed.<br><br>
