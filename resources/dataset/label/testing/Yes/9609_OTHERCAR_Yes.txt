            My Celica is great. I love this car and when my lease is up, I plan to get another one. The ride is so quiet and smooth. The GTS has more power than the GT so it really takes off very quickly and can reach high speeds without shaking like a lot of cars do. The handling is really good, it can take corners at high speeds with no problems. The Celica is such a nice and fun to drive car that I had trouble trying to think of any cons! I originally leased this car just for its appearance, but the ride is just as nice. The moonroof/sunroof opens quietly and easily, it never sticks or leaks. The drivers side floor mat has a hook that keeps it in place, which is really great, it never bunches up towards the top. The windshield wipers are really great, they swipe off a lot of the freezing rain that most other cars wipers cannot do. The dash,clock,and radio setup is a really neat, new design that goes really well with the car. The trunk offers tons of space, and the driver and passenger seats are very comfortable.
