            I came home from college to discover that I was a new uncle.  But, with all the joy and happiness that comes with newborns also comes the cost!  
My sister kept on dropping hints that our family needed a digital camera.  This was due to the fact that just seeing her kid wasn't enough, she wanted to take a bazzillion pictures of him.  Regular 35mm film and the developing process just didn't cut it for her anymore.

Grudgingly i went along with it and I started doing lots of research on cameras.  I went to all the usual places I go to before buying stuff- download.com, zdnet.com and of course epinions.com.  I'd just like to thank everyone here at epinions.com for their good reviews.  It was a big factor in me buying this camera.  

Here's the facts:
This camera got a great review from CNET and ZDNET.
The picture quality i saw was amazing (kodak.com)
It came with everything i needed- battery recharger, case, 8 megs

This is WHY i bought it:
List price for this camera ranges in the 600 -700s...  
But the price has dropped a lot!  I found this camera for around $400!

My Experience:
When i got this camera, I couldn't stop taking pictures!  
It did things i didn't know it could do: borders, black and white, digital zoom and a lot more.  The software that came with it was also great- adobe photodeluxe. It allows for great photo editing- like touchup and changing eye color.  The camera was easy to hook up and use.  It came with a recharging unit and batteries.  If it had an AC adapter to save batteries when transferring to the computer- it would be perfect!  

Battery life was a little disappointing, but that's to be expected.  Also the 8 meg memory card that is included can only hold 12 shots at best quality.  An extra 8 meg card costs around 30 bucks!  But in my case- 8 is enough.

Who should buy this?
Anyone who is thinking of getting a new digital camera, and isn't anal about SUPER REALISTIC QUALITY.  Of course you can't match the pictures of a real camera- but this one comes really close!  I know there are those 3.3 mega pix cameras now on the market, but this is an awesome camera for the price!  Go to Pricescan.com and search.
