            I purchased my Land Cruiser as a new vehicle in 1998.  From the time I drove it off the lot, I knew it was my perfect car.  It handles like a dream.  The steering is not loose, so it is easy to drive.  The automatic transmission makes long road trips easy, because there is no clutch to worry about.  The seats are plush, and very comfortable.  I could fall asleep in them.  There is plenty of room for a family of 5.  I have 2 kids, ages 7 and 9, and it has more than enough room for my them, myself, and my wife.  The gas mileage is economic.  I do not know how many miles exactly I get on a full tank, but I will update this opinion when I find out.  I have had this vehicle for several years now, and other than normal maintenance, it has only been in the shop once, and that was for damage from a shopping cart.  So overall, this is a great vehicle.  It has lots of power, and a very strong engine.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable SUV.
