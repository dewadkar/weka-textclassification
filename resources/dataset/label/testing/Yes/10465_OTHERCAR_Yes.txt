            If you look at my photo albums or the box full of negatives you would know I love taking photos. If I got a couple of really great shots from a roll of 36 exposures, I would be happy. That doesn't mean I chop everyones heads off or try to use a flash in a concert hall. 

We are on our forth personal computer so it was only natural that I started going digital. My first experience with color printers was a few years ago and the print quality was truly bad. Even on 'photo quality' that used all your ink. Now I can print out photos on a relatively cheap printer and even though I can pick out the tiny imperfections, to everyone else they think it is a film based photo. 

My friend has a five megapixel camera and they look really good. The Canon is a low cost camera. The two megapixels means I get pictures at 1600 x 1200. It is fine for the family snaps I take. The flash is only good for the normal ranges and there is no adjustment for flash strength. It is compact so I can carry it in my jacket or if I have pants on at work. (No jokes please).

The first day I used it, I consumed three new sets of alkaline batteries. So I purchased 2000mah Nickel Metal Hydrides rechargeables. One set lasts all day (regular use) so they are three times better than standard batteries. The inital cost of buying a charger is high but you can use the batteries anywhere. The flash does take about twenty seconds to charge up after you switch it on, after that, it takes about five seconds (depending on the batteries). I was worried about the NiMH creating too much heat, but it hasn't been a problem.

The 8mb Compact Flash card doesn't hold much. About nine pictures on the highest setting. Each picture is around 900kb depending in the subject. I bought a 128 mb card that holds approximately 1,000 low resolution pictures or 130 regular photos. The software is easy to use and I can rotate or zoom on pictures with the camera menu (easier to do it on the computer though). The camera adjusts in less than a second so photos are taken quickly. Nothing worse than you pressing the button and the person of interest has walked off by the time the camera flashes.

I have taken hundreds of pictures now and it hasn't failed once. I'm hoping it out lasts most of the electrical items in the home. Now the kids use it for everything. It doesn't matter how stupid the picture, I can always delete them. With 700 highest resolution pictures fitting on a CD, you will never need to worry about having too many photos.
