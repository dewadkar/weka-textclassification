            I got this camera as a prize on Bidbay.com.   I was shocked on the cost of this camera for one.   But once I started using it I could see why.

This Camera has Zoom for those closeup shots.  Its focuses for you.
You can save your pictures to a plain Floppy Diskette.
Thats the part I liked.   I didnt have to hook something up to my computer to see the pics.  You just remove the floppy and put it into your floppy drive and there are your pics.   Your Pictures are GREAT.   SO Clear and if you dont like the shot you took, Simply delete it with 2 touches of a button.

Another great feature is you can just plug it in to charge your battery.  You dont have to have one of those bulky battery chargers.   

On the back of the camera is a setting for Still Pictures of for your movie pics.  Then after you take the pic you can view it.   So nice.  You can choose whether you want your flash on or off and also has a great feature for red-eye reduction.  You even have volume for your movie pics.

This is the Digital Camera if you are in the works for shopping for a Camera.   Its worth every penny you will spend on it.
