            We needed a different vehicle, but I didn't want new. So we went looking for used vans. With 2 teens, a toddler and a new baby on the way, a car would have been impractical.
We looked at Aerostars, Safaris, Voyagers, and Caravans.

I immediately feel in love upon seeing this vehicle. Not only did it have the passenger seating I wanted, but also has two built in child seats! Never mind that it took me a week to figure out that they were there! The drive is so smooth and the seats so comfortable that you feel like you are at home. 
There are a few things that won't happen to me now since getting this Grand Caravan LE....

1. I can no longer lock my keys in the van, the doors will  not lock with the key in the ignition.

2. I don't have to worry about draining the battery if I happen to forget to turn off the lights :-) they shut off automatically after 15 min.

3. I will no longer get lost and wonder what direction I am traveling in. The built-in digital compass is a life saver!

4. I will no longer smash my sunglasses, there is a compartment overhead for me to place my sunglasses.

5. Under the passenger side seat there is a drawer that pulls out.. We keep all of our maps there! And it locks!

6. My kids are no longer cramped together in the back seat of a car. They all have plenty of room... which makes for a better driving experience for MOM!

If you have a growing family, I would really suggest looking into Dodge Caravans. I don't in particular like the newer models ( I don't like two sliding doors), if you don't mind used ( we don't especially since the previous owners installed "My Valet", we no longer have to get in a cold van in the winter)vehicles, and have limited cash... This is definitely the way to go.
