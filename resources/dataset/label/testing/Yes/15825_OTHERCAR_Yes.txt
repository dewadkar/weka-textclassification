            After a year of looking and test driving, I bought a Solara SE V6, and love the car.  It reminds me of a cross between a Lexus coupe &amp; the Camry.  I considered a Maxima and Accord V6 coupe, but the Solara was so silky smooth that it was irresistible.  A friend with a Lexus SC300 was very upset after driving my car; its very close to his in every category, but costs much less.

The JBL sound system rocks and reproduces bass very well even at high volumes.  The overall interior is very nice, sort of a refined, sporty feel.  The leather seats are very nice, although the ivory color means that I have to be very careful.

While the performance isn't quite up to that of the Maxima SE with a 5 speed, the overall driving experience blew the Maxima away for me.  This is a great car for driving &amp; touring!<br><br>
