            This is probably Kodak&#146s best selling digital camera so far. Since the introduction of the DC280, Kodak has introduced a lot more digital cameras with a lot more features and quality in the photos. When first introduced the camera sold for about $600, now if you shop on the Internet you can buy one as low as $339. 

This is a good entry-level camera that produces great quality photos at 1760 x 1168 pixels to give you a great 8 x 10 inch photo to print. It is basically a point and shoot camera with some manual settings for your preference. 

The DC280 has a built in zoom lens that is 2X optical or equivalent to a 35mm lens of 30-60mm. There is a 3X digital zoom to give you even closer shots. The macro on it for close up shots is pretty good. 

This camera gives you two choices for connecting to your computer, USB or Serial. I highly recommend the USB hookup if you have a USB port because it will download your photos about 10 times faster than the serial hookup.

It has a 1.8" TFT color LCD display, plus a viewfinder. Now you can take your photos using the viewfinder or the color LCD display. On the top of the camera is a monochrome LCD that will let you know how many photos you have left and more.

Through the color LCD you can review what photos you have taken, magnify any portion of the photo, delete photos, make a slide show and more.

It is a 2.3 megapixel digital camera with a built in flash and the photos are saved in the JPEG.

The DC2800 is made for the PC with Windows and the Macintosh. 

It takes 4 AA batteries to power it, you can use alkaline, NiMH, NiCd or lithium batteries. You can also get an optional AC Adapter to save on your batteries.

There is a Video out so you can view the photos over a TV set.

<b>Overall</b>
The photo quality is great in the best resolution, the colors are vivid and clear. When you use the lowest resolution, the photos are not that great, I recommend using the best resolution.

The 4 NiMH batteries with a charger is a big plus, I recommend buying 4 more NiMH batteries so you have a set charged up at all times. The batteries take about 8 hours to fully recharge. 

Using the color LCD for preview and review of images will drain the batteries quickly, I would recommend using the viewfinder to take your photos and save on the batteries being drained quick.

The shutter lag time is annoying to me, I know it is only a few seconds but it seems like minutes.

This is a nice camera but, I would recommend the <a href="/content_18840587908">Kodak DC3400 Zoom Digital Camera</a>, which is almost identical to the DC280 with a few improvements. The shutter lag time for one thing is a lot less. The DC3400 can be found on the Internet for $301, which makes it cheaper than the DC280, but it does not come with 4 NiMH batteries and charger. 

I do recommend the Kodak DC2800 because it will produce great looking photos in the best resolution.
