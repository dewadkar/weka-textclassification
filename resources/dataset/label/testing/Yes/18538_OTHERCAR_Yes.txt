            The new CTS has a very appealing image to the younger aduience. Cadillac has created a car for the younger teenage consumer. The CTS comes with a 5- speed automatic or 5- speed manual 3.2L 220 hp V6 engine. This car can RACE!
Its fast engine is ideal for the price. The CTS comes with all the luxury of a Cadillac. The CTS also has plenty of safety features. Including dual front airbags, dual side airbags, curtain side airbags, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control. Standard equipment includes dual-zone electronic climate control, power windows and door locks, remote keyless entry, leather trim, power driver's seat, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player. Daytime running lights, fog lights, front and rear stabilizer bars and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels are also standard. I have had the CTS for about 1 month now. The car runs very smooth and has great ACCELERATION. It takes off like a bullet. This is a great care to show off infront of your friends and also this is a great car for a family of 4. It is very roomy and safe.
