            I bought a 1995 Dodge Caravan (base) used with 80,000 miles for about $4,300.  The body was straight, the engine was clean, but it just looked awful - as if it hadn't been washed for a few years.

It was a good buy, though, and a day of quality time spent with soap and polish made it shine like new.  I changed the oil, filters and belts, and haven't had a single problem since.

No, the Dodge Caravan isn't sexy.  But there's a reason why it's the standard by which other minivans are measured.  Dodge/Chrysler has been building family vans for over a decade, and there's no doubt in my mind that they build some of the best.  Even my Caravan - in which the extent of luxury features was a tape deck - is a pleasure to drive.

The "boxy" shape (they turned round in 1996) is an advantage to me, anyway.  The corners are easier to peg, making parallel and reverse-in parking a snap.  And the interior has almost no wasted space.

It's basic, but it works well.  The mechanics in the cabin do what they need to do with minimal fuss.  From adjusting to removing seats, I have no complaints (though yes, the benches are quite large and heavy).  I've settled on driving with the third-row seat in, but folded over - good cargo space, but it can take passengers in a pinch.

The instrument panel is similarly rudimentary but functional.  I prefer lockdown buttons to confusing digital toggles, in any case.  Some of the little touches - like the multi-position slider for the interior lights - remind me that Dodge has had many years to perfect their formula.

I've gotten a consistent 20 miles per gallon since the day I bought it, and in a year I've driven nearly 25,000 miles.  The ride is somewhat stiff (enough to keep me awake, which might be a good thing), but steering is responsive.  Interior noise is a bit loud, particularly on concrete, but nothing that the stock radio can't decently mask.

All in all, I'm very happy with my Caravan, basic and used as it is.  (I even built a web page for it, and it gets lots of traffic.)  I'd take it over a round and bubbly, all-digital VCR-equipped geekfest any day.
