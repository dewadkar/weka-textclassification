            If you have had the chance to read my other reviews, you will know that my ex-boyfriend had a '99 Lexus RX300.  Its not the most expensive, nor the largest, nor the flashiest of all Sport Utility Vehicles, but it does have an excellent balance of all three qualities.  The RX300 has a seemingly small chassis as compared to a Lincoln Navigator or Caddillac Escalade, but the interior is suprisingly roomy.  The SUV functions of the RX300 is excellent.  There is a fold down rear seat that allows for an expansion of the cargo area, and the leg room and head room for both front and rear passengers are more than enough.  This is all due to the excellent design and set-up of the interior by TOYOTA (which makes Lexus).  The oval like shape of the RX300 gave the engineers the necessary means to create a spacious interior.  The interior comfort rivals much larger SUVs like the Navigator.  The RX300 has this comfortable interior along with a much softer and easier ride.  Whereas the Navigator and Escalade are extremely difficult to drive because of its unnecessarily huge size,  Lexus has successfully created a balance of interior comfort and &quot;car-like&quot; drive.  When I would take this Lexus out for a spin, I felt like I was driving a sedan and the ride was extremely smooth.  Also, the interior cabin noise was extremely low.  In Grand Cherokees, Expeditions, Navigators, and Range Rovers the noise from the engine are extremely loud.  Lexus has a smooth purring engine that is like that of the ES300.  The body roll is also much less in the RX300.  If you were to take a sharp 90 degree turn with a Isuzu Trooper or Navigator, you would not have the control as you do in the RX300.  The RX300 corners like a sedan and it does not have that uneasy feeling of possibly tipping commonly felt in most other SUVs.  The styling is also very unique.  The projector style rear tail lights add the finishing touch to the appeal of the SUV.  The lines of the design are also very sleek, commonplace in luxury sports sedans.  Most other SUVs have boxy and clunky styles that do not appeal to most car enthusiasts.  The only other SUV that I would say is better looking than the RX300 is the BMW X-5.  The BMW X-5 has a very nice chassis and design.  It almost looks like a 5 series Wagon with SUV height and wheels.  I have yet to ride or drive a X-5, but I am sure the handling is comparable if not better than the RX300.  However, the RX300 does have its own unique characteristics.  If you are considering a SUV for around $33,000, definitely put the RX300 on your test drive list.  The interior layout is luxurious and comfortable, and the styling and handling is outstanding.    <br><br>
