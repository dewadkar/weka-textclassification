            Ask any parent who�s ever had to haul two seven year olds across town and they�ll tell you, � The wheel was man�s greatest invention, until I had to get behind it�. My husband and I were of the same opinion. We have two children, Josh (7) and Kate (6), and somewhere along their growth path my quiet little children have mutated into maniacal conversationalist cellular megaphones. Their daycare is ten miles from our home, so each morning before making my faithful workday commute into the city I have to laboriously shake the children awake, throw them into denim, and then crawl across town with the two adolescent chatterboxes wailing away as if I�m the trash receptacle for every life experience they�ve ever historically encountered.

 Thank God Chevrolet took the time to tackle an age-old predicament: How do you get kids to be seen but not heard? We recently purchased the 2001 Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Edition and our lives and perspective have been forever changed. We love the roominess of the mini-van, the throttle power is adequate, and the flip-fold seats are so lightweight I have no problem re-configuring or even removing them from the van altogether. But what we like most is the VCR/TV combo matched with the rear seat separate channel radio/CD all polished off beautifully with self contained headsets at each rear area seating position. Chevy has created the Rosetta stone of family road trip nirvana.

 My husband and I each grind out 60 hour plus work weeks, top them off with a 45 minute each way commute and you can see why a simple cross town jaunt with the offspring interrogation duo each evening is like chewing on tin foil. But with the Venture we simply throw them in the back, strap on a headset, pop in a video, and away we go surrounded by silence. It�s as if we don�t even have children at all, heaven on wheels. No more "guess what I did today mom" or "I need help on my homework mom" and I surely won't miss the old "mom I think this infection is spreading"...oh silence is bliss.

 Everyone fears becoming like his or her parents and my husband and I are no different. I won�t soon forget the treacherous family vacations of my youth. The hours long car rides with mother leading us in song, or boring us with a book reading, and grab a pillow for cover if dad launches into one of his �parental responsibility� life lesson sessions. Egads, how I ever survived that much interaction with my elders is beyond comprehension. 

To give our newfound best friend a real test we recently drove our Venture all the way down to Virginia, a ten hour drive. We let the kids bundle up their favorite movies, CDs, and video games, strapped on their headsets and hit the open road smiling. If the kids weren�t listening to Emenem, they were watching Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone steam up the screen, and when they tired of Hollywood they�d simply plug in the Playstation and dismember some bad guys. Meanwhile my husband and I enjoyed the drive without ever having to address our offspring even once!

 I�m telling you, if Chevy could somehow make those headsets in a wireless model so the kids could wear them 24/7, raising children might actually seem worthwhile.
