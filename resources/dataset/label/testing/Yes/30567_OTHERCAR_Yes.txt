            After our 1997 Chrysler T & C Minivan started needing repairs every month we went new car shopping.  Looked at Surburban,(too big, too thirsty), Expedition (same), Envoy XL (why buy a stretch ?) and Highlander (too small) We settled on the Pilot.  Now to find one.  I called over 20 delaerships in a 150 mile radius and came up with two in stock.  Negotiations were not in the cards.  It was list price and above.  Friends and family suggested that we should just get a Ford or Chevy what with the great 0% financing and all.  I looked at it as woould I rather have a bad deal on a good car or a good deal on a bad car.  We purchased the EX-L at list price.  The dealer did take off the dealer installed options that we did not want.  

Driving this vehicle is not unlike driving the minivan... and that is a good thing. It does not ride like a "truck" nor does it feel like it will tip over in the corners.  I understand that its sister, the Acura MDX handles even better but I did not feel that some of the minor differences were worth the $8000 difference in price.  

The acceleration is excellent.  The sounds coming from the engine are muted and very sweet.  The transmission shifts beautifully, although it does shift frequently on slight uphills.  I have towed our Mastercraft ski boat (3500 lbs.) without feeling any strain.  

The interior is laid out where everything falls to hand.  Fit and finish are typically Honda, that is perfect.  The US makes should take a lesson.  I am 6'3" and I find plenty of leg and head room.  My daughter is only 5'4" and she has no problem either.  

I have found an excellent forum where anyone can listen to other owners www.hondapilot,org
