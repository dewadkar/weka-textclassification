            David Letterman was right--the "Zoom-Zoom" kid in the Mazda ads is kinda creepy. But this car rules!

<b>Cathy Goes Car Shopping</b>
When it came time to replace my 7-year-old Ford Contour, my first thought was that I wanted an Acura RSX-Type S. Until I sat in one. The cockpit-like controls made me feel claustrophobic, and the sharp slant of the roof meant little room in the back seat for human-sized passengers.

Next up was the Subaru WRX Sport Wagon. Loved it. Great car, but at $25,000 or so, a bit more than I had hoped to spend. 

With the Mazda Protege 5, it was love at first drive. Other reviewers have commented on a lack of power. Perhaps they were driving an automatic. The 5-speed manual offers great acceleration. For the test drive we had probably 600 pounds of human cargo, and the car took off easily.  The brakes (non-ABS) stop the car quickly and cleanly.

One issue that comes up when my husband and I go car shopping is whether we can each fit in the car. I'm 5'1", he's 6'5". Often, if I can reach the pedals he's hitting his head on the roof. We both fit comfortably in the P5.

<b>The Dealer Slime Factor</b>
The only way I would buy the P5 was if I could find a yellow one with a 5-speed. The first dealer I visited didn't have any. I got on the Internet and found a few through the Mazda web site.

At both dealerships we visited, the salesmen we dealt with were knowledgeable and helpful. This stood out in stark contrast to the Ford dealership where we were not allowed to test drive the Focus SVT, and the sales staff seemed not to know much about their cars. The shopping and buying experience were very easy and pleasant. No slime.

<b>Buying the Car</b>
The two yellow P5s we looked at were loaded with options, many of which I wouldn't have added but fall in the "nice to have" category--such as the sunroof and the 6-CD changer. We were able to get a couple of grand knocked off the price, but at $18,995, the price was more than the average P5 because of all the dealer-installed options. The fact I was getting 0% financing for four years, with no down payment and no payments for more than four months, helped make the buy decision easier.

<b>So, How is the Car?</b>
In the short time (~10 weeks) I've owned the car, it has already been on a few road trips. The seats are comfortable even during trips of four or more hours. The low-profile tires allowed me to feel every bump in a bumpy stretch of I-10, but that was an exception, as the ride is usually quite comfortable.

Fuel economy has been great. Typical city MPG is 26 - 27, and the car uses regular gasoline, not premium. The P5 handles well and is fun to drive. There have been no problems with the car, and it has required no service or repair.

The stereo system sounds fair. I'm not the most discriminating listener, so it's fine with me, but it bugs my husband (must be a guy-thing). 

The only thing that annoys me is that the cup holders are incredibly shallow, so when I put a 16 oz. water bottle in one, it tips over and falls out of the cup holder. Also, there is a cover over the cup holders so when I flip up the cover to use the cup holder, I can't get to my garage door opener. If the cup holders are the only thing I can find to complain about, I must lead a pretty cushy life.

<b>Should You Buy One?</b>
I would recommend the Mazda Protege 5 if you are looking for a fun to drive, economical car. You can carry four adults comfortably, or fold down the back seat for more cargo space. The fit and finish is excellent. This isn't a luxury car, so there are smoother, quieter rides out there; however, the ride and comfort are excellent for a car of this class. Oh, and if you get a yellow one, you will always stand out in a crowd!
