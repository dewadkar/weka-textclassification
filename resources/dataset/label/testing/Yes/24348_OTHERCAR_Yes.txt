            The style caught me right off, the red color was perfect and the gray interior and price was right. I'm a big guy so the seat is always all the way back and the Dakota has more way back than others. The ride and feel is terrific, more pep and go. I was surprised. Mileage at 16.5 is ehh, but the V6 is worth it. The general feel behind the wheel fits. No roll on curves, good pickup on hills and cruises at 70 on the freeway with no effort. I rate this Dakota way over the last three Chevy's I've had in the past 10 years.<br><br>
