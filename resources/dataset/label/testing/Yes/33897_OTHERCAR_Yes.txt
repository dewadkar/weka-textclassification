            Taking advantage of Subaru's financing deals (0% for 24 months, 2.9 for 48 months) I decided to trade in my 2001 Forester with 29k miles for a newer model. The dealer was able to match my monthly payment amount while rolling in all costs so that I drove away in a new 2003 without having to come up with any cash and with little impact to the family finances.

I liked my 2001 Forester but it had a recurring A/C condensation drain/moisture problem and the battery needed replacing after less than two years' use. We were a bit disappointed in its handling on snow, as well.  However, the majority of my time is on city/suburban streets, and under those conditions (especially on rain-slicked streets) it handled very well. 

The 2003 Forester is much improved and much better looking, both on the interior and exterior. I've yet to test it on snow pack but will have that opportunity soon. The brakes seem better, it doesn't have the jerky off the stop acceleration of my 2001, and it seems roomier inside. 

The 2001 had several annoying features that have been corrected, mostly cosmetic v. performance-related. Foremost, those annoying cupholders have been moved to a center console! They've also shortened the third headrest in the back, so that you don't have to remove it to see out the rear window.

They changed the front seats to be stiffer, and IMO, less comfortable. 

So far so good, but I'm only a few days into this...
