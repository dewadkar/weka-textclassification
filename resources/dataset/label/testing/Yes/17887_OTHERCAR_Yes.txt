            The 3.5RL, Acura's flagship sedan is a practical sedan comparable to such luxurious vehicles as the LS400 and the E class Mercedes Benz.  The RL has been called a &quot;poor man's lexus&quot; by so many because of the lower cost of this car but similar style of automobile.

First I would like to explain my background and familiarity with the Acura 3.5RL.  My family has been a fan of Acura for many years.  We first owned an Acura Legend for 5 years which was passed from my mother to my brother when he turned 16.  After the Legend was discontinued by Acura, my parents got a 3.2RL.  Furthermore, my parents would own 2 other 3.5RL's after the 3.2RL.  As you can see, I have experienced several Acura sedans, so I have definite exposure to the vehicle discussed here.

<b>Performance</b>
This vehicle comes with a powerful 3.5 liter V6 engine.  210 horses power the RL and make for some decent acceleration.  This is a large car at about 3700 pounds, so the acceleration will not overpower you.  I have found that when already moving, if you put the pedal down, the car has a rather long pause before the car kicks back and goes.  However, for the average driver, the engine should be sufficient.  In comparing the RL to most Lexus and Mercedes sedans, there is an obvious gap in performance considering most of those vehicles pack a V8.

<b>Suspension and handling</b>
The 2000 model has a new handling system called Vehicle Stability Assist.  This system has traction control and an outstanding anti-lock braking system which will keep this car under control in shaky conditions.  Personally, I have had some fun with this car taking corners and driving around curves at higher speeds.  The handling is pretty good, but note that it is obviously not going to be as good as Mercedes, Lexus, and BMW.  Overall, the RL is easy to control and provides a great smooth, comfortable ride.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of the RL is spectacular.  Leather seats with power controls give great comfort to the driver and his/her passengers.  A 7 inch DVD navigation screen is an option on the 2000 RL.  There is more than ample leg room for front and rear passengers.  The Bose stereo upgrade is definitely a good buy which provides a ear pleasing sound.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior of the RL is very professional as well as slightly sporty.  The front of this car, in my opinion, rivals that of many of the other popular luxury sedans.  The car comes with 16 inch wheels that provide a nice appearance.  For those interested in purchasing this car, I suggest the black exterior color.

<b>Reliability</b>
With both 3.5RL's which my family has owned, we have had very little problems with them.  The cars have never broken down, and have only needed the regular maintenance which comes with owning ANY automobile.  The Acura dealership where I live has been extremely helpful should any problem arise.  The RL is a 10 out of 10 on the reliability scale.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The price of the 3.5RL is from $42,000 to $45,000.  This is a very practical and economical price for those looking for a professional, luxurious, roomy sedan.  When compared to 4 door sedans from BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes, the cost is significantly cheaper.  For those looking for a sedan in the price range of the RL, check out the Lincoln LS.  My family and I have thoroughly enjoyed driving the RL (which is obvious since we have owned several).  If you are looking for a luxurious sedan that is less expensive than most Mercedes and Lexus sedans, I highly recommend you check out the Poor Man's Lexus: the Acura 3.5RL!
