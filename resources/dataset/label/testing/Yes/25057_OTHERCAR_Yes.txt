            Recently my "point and shoot" Kodak digital camera DC3200 ( <a href='/elec-review-1210-394BBB2E-3A501247-prod5/tk_~CB005.1.7'>http://www.epinions.com/elec-review-1210-394BBB2E-3A501247-prod5/tk_~CB005.1.7</a> ) was ripped off.  I liked that simple camera, and it did introduce me to the world of digital photography.

I decided I wanted my replacement camera to have the flexibility of a good 35mm SLR camera, and of course I wanted all the megapixels I could get.  There are good cameras from Olympus that met my requirements, but the Kodak 4800 seemed made for me. I'm not alone, because it's been the top seller at Amazon lately.

When I saw it at Sears with a $100 rebate and another 10% off for using my Sears card, I snapped it up.  I'm glad I did.  My bottom line was $439 ($599 x 90% - $100). This is a bargain price for a 3.1 megapixel camera.

This is a very full featured camera.  The features I like the best are:

1) 3x optical zoom (about like an 85mm lens on an 35mm SLR)

2) easy to use exposure compensation.  A must have feature.

3) dial selectable automatic or fixed aperture mode. Menu selectable shutter speed.

4) Built in flash, and (hooray!) support for an external flash unit.

5) Includes a 16M compact flash card

6) USB support.  Kodak includes a USB cable.  There is no need to buy a USB card reader.  Plug in the camera and it's memory card appears to your computer to be an external drive.

7) The included software can be used to set all the many options of that the camera offers.  You can even take pictures without touching the camera by using the software.

8) When I registered my camera on line, they promised to send me a free lens adapter.  With the adapter, you can add external lenses to the camera.  I am looking forward to getting  telephoto and macro lenses.

Drawbacks:

1) No manual focus.  The autofocus works well, but there are times when manual focus would be good to have.  

2) The more I use the Kodak "Picture Now Software", the more I hate it. It's the same software I had with my earlier point and shoot.  It's a macromedia GUI that runs only in full screen mode, so forget dragging and dropping.  It's limited editing might be fine for the point and shoot, but the kind of power user that buys this camera will quickly grow out of this little program. Figure on getting a photo editor software.

3)  The camera doesn't have a true "bulb" mode, but it does support exposure times of up to 16 seconds.  It also has an included video out cable

4) The camera uses a weird rechargeable battery that doesn't have a long life. You have to be sure and turn the camera off when you are not using it.  The battery takes four hours to recharge in the camera.  The optional second battery and fast charger will be "must haves" to most buyers of this camera.

So what's it like to use?

It's a little thicker than a lot of cameras because of the good optical lens.  It's not real heavy, the included neck strap is comfortable enough.  The package doesn't include a camera case, so I use a fanny pack I had around the house.  

The camera has a color LCD display on the back, and another LCD mode display on the top.  The top display is very similar to that of the typical 35mm SLR camera.  The top display even includes a readout of "pictures remaining" at the current quality setting.

To start with, just select the "P" mode on the mode select wheel.  This puts the camera in a fully automatic aperture priority mode.  Play with it a while. Next practice with the flash.  The flash mode can be set with a separate switch (God bless Kodak for that) to anti-red eye, always on, or automatic.  The camera also has a switch for normal, telephoto, and macro modes.  A third switch lets the user select self-timer or five shot auto mode.  Be sure and practice with the five shot mode.  When I was in Washington last week the President blasted by me in his limo, and I only got one shot of him because I didn't know how to select the five shot mode.

A very important feature is the mechanical dial for setting exposure compensation values.  This dial makes it easy to get good pictures that have uneven or extreme lighting conditions.  I was able to use it to take excellent pictures of the stain glass windows in the Washington National Cathedral.

Once you've figured the switches out, it's time to go into the menus to play with the many other options available.  The easiest way is to plug in the USB cable and user your PC to set the various options, and then take some test shots.  There are many menu options to explore, but the fully automatic mode works fine for most situation.

The only menu option you'll want to use right way is the picture quality selection.  You can select from a very grainy low res mode all the way up to an uncompressed 3.1 megapixel mode.  Like all digital cameras, the more quality you ask for the fewer pictures you can store at any given quality setting

Picture quality for me has been outstanding.

Kodak did an outstanding job with this camera.  Highly recommended.
