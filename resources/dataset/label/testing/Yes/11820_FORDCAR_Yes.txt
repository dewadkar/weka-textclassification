            **My apologies to those who already rated this - it was pointed out to me that this epinion was in the wrong category - Lord knows how that happened!**

The year was 1996. Clinton was President, the U.S. economy was on the up swing, unemployment was low and stocks were high and Ford was not behind the times! The only thing that was similar about the 1995 and the 1996 Ford Taurus was the name. Inside and out, the Ford Taurus got a total make over! 

Calling the 1996 Ford Taurus "all new" is no understatement. The boxy look of the older Taurus is replaced with oval and ergodynamic contours. From a distance, the 1996 looks smaller than the 1995, however, this vehicle is a full five inches longer and two inches wider than the older Taurus. 

The engine is a 6 cylinder, 3.0 liter, vulcan engine. For people like me, who know absolutely nothing about engines, this means power. Enough power for those steep and curvy hills I climb each day to work. Power enough to pass those tractors on a two lane highway with speed and efficiency. 

The heating and air conditioning work extremely well. The back seat passengers will really enjoy this ride, because of the new floor ducts that send a rapid flow of air to the rear. 

The trunk is very roomy. The back seats open up to make even more room for those extra large loads. Speaking of the back seat, there is plenty of room for three people with loads of leg room. 

The front seat is divided by a nifty center section that can be used as a seatback, armrest or center console depending on the way it's positioned. Inside the divider are cupholders (graduated in size and elevation to accommodate a variety of beverage container sizes), however, a word of caution, I have had a few spills as the cupholders are not adjustable to cup size. 

One ovoid shape does appear in the interior. It's the panel carrying climate and sound system controls. One big downside of the control panel is that it doesn't lend itself to aftermarket audio installations, and a CD player is absent from the option list. So for those of you who love to have the CD tunes in your car, this is a real minus. The panel does include a cassette player, something I have actually enjoyed as I am now digging out some of my real "old" tunes. 

Let's face it, this car is all about looks. But there is so much more. With a quiet and comfy ride, roomy seats, and a good handle on the roadways, the 1996 Ford Taurus is a great car.
