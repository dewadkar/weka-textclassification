            In this review I will cover my experiences with my 97 Civic, which has 110K miles on it.  I'm a high mileage driver and the 97 Civic EX hasn't failed me yet.  As you can guess by the title, I've put in about 30+K miles on my Civic a year.  And, as you would suspect, I've had almost no trouble with it.

Brakes:  Working fine.  The first time I changed them was after 105K miles.

Fuel Economy:  Around 30mpg, a little lower than I hoped for but fairly constant since I bought the car.

Interior:  Still comfortable, and holding up well.  The seats are still firm, the plastic dash material isn't brittle yet, and the carpets look good.  The floor mats are pretty worn though.  When I get out of the car, though I get a static shock.  I don't think it�s grounded very well.

Climate Control:  After 3 yrs my air conditioner is getting weaker, but that�s all.  The car seems to retain humidity and the front window will fog up.  But when I turn on the defogger it clears it up in about 5-10 seconds.

Exterior:  Looks good, no accidents yet.  The paint seems to scratch easy, though.  The rubber trim around the headlights has pealed back, also.

Windows:  Ahh, I had the driver's side power window fail twice!  The first time was under warranty.  The second time was on me! ($170).  The power sunroof still works without a problem and without a leak.  I think sunroofs are essential.  I need sunlight.


Power:  120HP.  Has met my needs, but can make passing a pain.  It's hilly where I drive and it holds its own, but if I have to brake going up hill it�s hard to regain the momentum.

Repairs:  Only the power window.  Everything else has been routine maintenance.  And I hope it stays that way for another 100K or more.

Good Luck all.
