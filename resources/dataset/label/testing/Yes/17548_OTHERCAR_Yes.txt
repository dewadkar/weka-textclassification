            I have a 91 jeep Wrangler and I still love it. Yes I am a female with a jeep. I baby my jeep. I have picked driving my Jeep Wrangler over my Jaguar that is sitting outside. Even though the Jeep isn't for everyone, it is still my number 1 pick. I have been through a few recalls on the brakes and gas tank, but if you buy it new the manufacture will contact you.

They don't get the best gas mileage. They do sit up a little higher than some automobiles. But if you notice most trucks do. I wouldn't recommend them if you have a bad back, or if your wife is pregnant. You can feel every bump in the road. If you have a soft top expect to be use to yelling instead of talking to the person next to you, if you are going over 55 on the interstate. These are very noisy. (that's why you put a very good sound system in)But remember, You can't lock up a soft top. To many zippers for people to unzip and reach right in. I do strongly suggest an alarm system. Not much room for children or a lot of groceries.

To own a jeep is like owning a piece of freedom. You take the top off and you just feel free. Not like riding in a convertible. Convertibles you can't take the doors off. 

You can take your jeep anywhere! It makes you feel better with the sun shining down on you and the wind through your hair. And when you buy a Jeep you will notice when other Jeep's pass by you they give you a little wave like there is some secret Jeep club. 

I know there are some cons to having a Jeep but it is worth it! If you really want a Jeep and your heart is set on it then GO FOR IT! Because you want be satisfied until you do! Just don't forget to get air conditioning.(for when it is to hot to take the top off)
