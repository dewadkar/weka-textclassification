            A dear friend has owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee for a number of years now, and during her recent visit, I got the chance to take it for a few spins and form an impression of this popular vehicle. She owns the Laredo model, and as someone who feels that the mark is missed when you load up a sports-utility with leather seats and a host of other luxury-car options, it is the model I would purchase. 

The Jeep was well equipped, with all power options, CD player, cruise, air, roof rack, trip computer, and the optional overhead console with digital compass, garage door opener, and map lights.  The exterior struck a perfect balance between Soccer-Mom cruiser and rugged truck.  The plastic cladding along the lower body is nice looking, and I imagine it would prevents chips in the paint for those who actually take the truck off road.  

Inside, the power seats made for easy adjustments in several directions--it wouldn't be hard for anyone to find a driving position that suited them.  The seats were comfortable, though I would desire a little more lumbar support.  The back seats fold forward and down to increase cargo capabilities--the conversion is quick and easy. Climate and audio controls were an easy reach for the driver, and while I felt that some of the buttons could have been larger, a few more days with the Jeep would have left me comfortable controlling all of the features without taking my eyes from the road. 

Driving the Jeep was something else I would have had to get used to.  The engine was powerful, delivering admirable and smooth acceleration.  Body lean in cornering was considerably less than in other sports-utes I have driven. The downside was the the rear end had an unsettling amount of sway over bumps.  

All in all, the Jeep Grand Cherokee seems to be a smart buy.  Outside of normal maintenance (and a few weeks in the shop after an accident) my friend has never had to do anything to her Jeep (and this is after 53,000 miles).  It is roomy, comfortable, and substantial feeling.  <br><br>
