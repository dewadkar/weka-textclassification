            The Saturn SL2 is my first and only car.  I've driven my friends car's but nothing satisfies my need for speed like my own.  Although it is a 95 Saturn, it picks up very nicely and it reaches very high speeds.  The speed was not why i bought the car however.  I heard that the Saturn company builds reliable cars and it really does.  The previous owner had no problems and I haven't had any either.  During this winters icy conditions, I didn't have a problem driving because of the traction control and ABS system.  I also enjoy the comfortable interior and the large back seat.  The trunk is big enough for the hockey equipment of two adults.  The best part of the car is its gas mileage.  I get about 250miles between each gas stop where i only pay about 13 dollars.  I don't dislike anything about the vehicle, it's just awesome.  I highly recommend it to any one.  It is working really well as a student car.<br><br>
