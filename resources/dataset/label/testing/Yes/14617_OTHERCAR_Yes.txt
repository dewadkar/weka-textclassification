            We were looking for a vehicle that was safe and would last long enough to send our children to college in and we believe this car is it.  We were burned on an American car that we purchased new, so we really wanted to make sure we found the car for us.  We looked at this car.

We tested a pile of cars.  We looked at a three series BMW, a Saab, an Audi, and this Volvo.  We tested them and formed our own opinions of each one of these cars.  Each one of these cars had good points and bad points.  We decided to purchase the Volvo.

We have owned this car for two years now.  In that time, the only mechanical problem we have had was the passenger window switch is fussy.  The car runs wonderfully, starts even on the coldest days, and handles wonderfully!!  I truly love my little Volvo.

This car has a pile of wonderful features.  It has cup holders in the front and back seats.  It has a rear fog light.  It has duel climate controls, so my husband can be cold and I can be warm.  It has locks on the seat belts you don�t have to fight with locking clips when you put in a child seat.  With this stuff, the seats have to be the most comfortable seats I have ever been in!!

The car is also very safe.  It is one of the safest cars ever made, which makes it ideal for a family.  There is plenty of room for a car seat in the back and an adult.  It does get somewhat cramped with a car seat and two adults in the back.  The trunk is large enough to fit a huge stroller and a large grocery-shopping trip.

Another feature, or at least cool thing about this car is that it is environmentally sound.  The factory uses a special water base paint, which does not pollute the environment like other paints do.  The car has low emissions and just naturally will fit California emission standards.

With this car I can think of only two down falls, price and perception.  This car ranges from 26,500 to 40,000 plus depending on what toys you get on it.  We purchased the base Volvo with a manual transmission.  The price of our car was 26,500.  That is more expensive that most American sedans, but that is lot cheaper than most trucks or 4x4 SUVs.  My thought is that it is worth the price if you can afford it.

The perception of this car kind of stinks.  First, people who see you in this car think you are loaded.  The car looks just like the 40,000 version and that helps to bring on that perception.  There is also this �soccer mom� stigma that goes along with the car.  This helps people to pull out in front of you or automatically think you are going slower than you are.

Pros:
1.	There are so many pros to this car that I can�t really name them.  It is a wonderful car!!

Cons:
1.	Cost.  It is kind of expensive for a sedan.
2.	People automatically think you are rich or you are going slowly.

Overall:
This is a great car.  It is comfortable, reliable, nice looking, and large!  I love this car and hope to always have a Volvo parked in our driveway.
