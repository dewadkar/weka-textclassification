            I own a 1997 Grand Caravan Sport. After 41,000 miles the reliability has been exceptional.  It is a very versatile vehicle.  I can carry 7 adults in comfort or move furniture.  The 3.3 litter engine has plenty of power. The van is really fun to drive around town and very comfortable on long trips.  The drivers side passenger door is a great convenience for getting in and out.  The large cargo space in the grand version eliminates the need to remove the rear seat in many cases.  As I did my comparison shopping no other company offered as many items standard for the money. Ford did not offer the left side passenger door until the 1999 models. Quality,versatility and fun ; that's what you get with the Dodge Grand Caravan.<br><br>
