            I took delivery of this S500 first thing on Monday 7th Jan. 2002. It was specified in Almandine black with Java beige interior trim. This is the third Mercedes there's been in my family and the first brand new one. The others were a 300SE (1986) and a C220 (1994) [I am in England in case the Model numbers seem unfamiliar to some!]

My review or perhaps more correctly - critique - may not be your typical Motoring journalist's look and appraisal of the car and anyway, don't forget that we drive on the wrong side of the road!  I find that I tend to seek vastly different things from cars than maybe others do. So be warned!

Anyway, I bought this car because I had no choice, but no-one made me buy it either. Sounds strange? I did it because when I had the money to buy it, there was nothing else around - but it. Here's why -  

1) Firstly, I hate Jaguars with a passion. They may be more reliable than the Space Shuttle these days but in my eyes they are and always will be cheap English junk masquerading as luxury cars. All the wood and leather in the world can't make amends for the serious lack of pedigree which can only come from a carmaker that started life making motorcycle sidecars. The fact that their bread and butter XJ design hasn't significantly changed since the 60s speak volumes.

2)I am bored with BMWs which have been my standard cars for donkeys years and especially now that I don't like the looks of the new 7-series coming out here in May. 

3)We don't have much of a choice of American cars in right-hand-drive here except two appalling Caddy Seville models that are seriously overpriced here, however, I would love to have owned a Lincoln Towncar - probably the most comfortable car I've ever been in.

4)Ferrari, Porsche, Maserati etc rule themselves out on the grounds of practicality (although I would have loved to have owned them)

5) Lexus - I am not convinced as to the luxury and pedigree of these cars although most people I am sure are. Having a bunch of airy-fairy advertising types sitting round a table dreaming up a name for a luxury car doesn't necessarily sell it to me. Don't get me wrong, I am very fond of Toyota and have owned a number of them. I would much rather go for a Toyota Crown Royal Saloon (which of course isn't available here!) 

6) Second hand Bentleys, Rollers - If you can't afford them new, it is downright ungentlemanly to buy them used.

So, my line of thought eventually led me to the inevitable pearly gates of DaimlerChrysler. UK car prices are extortionate so I imported mine from Belgium and offset fiscal savings against more equipment.

Now, before I parted with my hard earned cash, I had severe reservations about the S-Class. I wasn't overly enamoured by the looks. Most worryingly, the profile of the side windows and doors with their roof lipping design coincided too heavily with the looks of the Peugeot 406 (a common or garden car over here)for real comfort. There is something, bulbous, clumsy, unappealing and common about it's exterior looks. Consider the 80s era S-Class (NOT the one prior to the latest model!!), my wife owned a 300SE back then. It was beautiful and imposing to behold. You can often still see it on TV at gatherings of diplomats and politicians. It felt super-solid and honed from a rock. The interior materials where of unsurpassed quality and designed for longevity and the quality of construction was breathtaking for what was a mass-produced car. Consider also the car I owned prior to my S-Class - a 1999 BMW 528iSE Auto. The aesthetic design of this car was simply beautiful almost from any angle. It was also fairly inoffensive to drive but somehow there was something missing...I longed for a 3-pointed star on my bonnet once again, but I also longed for real engineers and not unimaginative lame-brained penny-pinching pen-pushing accountants to be in command at Daimler-Benz(!!)once again. Someone predicted that the loss of the oil pressure gauge was an omen of the decline to come....
(BTW I was an accountant before starting my own business!!)

Anyway, back to my impressions before purchase...

The interior looked and felt very ordinary. The window scuttle line was so low that one feels slightly exposed....like sitting in a bath tub. 

Worst of all, the Mercedes DNA is gone!

By this I mean gone are the gorgeous, chunky thickly padded central door-pillars which were so evidently Mercedes. 

Gone is the wood-swathed wide centre console - to be replaced with an oblong unit that looks like a demented cash machine designed by a bunch of emotionally and aesthetically deprived children! The buttons for the COMAND and other functions are thoroughly counter-intuitive and the handbook is novel sized and well written....although snore inducing.

Gone is the distinctive interior roof-lining detailing which too was hallmark Mercedes such as the pillars and sides being a different colour and material from the ceiling and the way the surfaces blended together in the most distinctive and stylish manner. Now, looking up at the roof, it is just like any other car out there, BMW included...utterly bland, boring and passionless   

Gone is the original 'Mercedes style' instrument cluster replaced by something that looks like a bland and bad Lexus imitation. When sitting in a '94 C-Class (which itself was headed on a downhill path), you could could transport yourself back to an 80s or 90s S-Class and find that the size of things that came to hand where really the only differences. Everything carried that strong Mercedes DNA which sadly is starting to disappear from all their cars. 

As if all of this, for a start, wasn't bad enough, the plastics they have used are jaw-droppingly poor and they've used acres of it unless you opt for the 'exclusive Nappa leather' option - which I didn't. To be honest, it feels like sitting in a Nissan more than a Mercedes.

This is a car I was indifferent to. It did not make me feel like getting into it because you could see what you'd get once inside and to me it wasn't particularly appealing. The looks, texture, feel and integrity of an interior means everything to me....call it a fetish if you like!

The doors feel light-ish compared to the old cars, but permeating all this is the feeling that something is missing which I can't quite put my finger on....maybe it is just a feeling induced by the rotten design of the interior.

I bought this car totally devoid of passion and with a resigned comportment. However, when you turn the key in the ignition and get moving, things start picking up. The engine is muted and has an unremarkable tone just like any other Mercedes. However, when you plant the right foot, you know where some of the engineering went. I have driven a Cadillac DeVille with a Northstar V-8 and was told that it was 300 bhp. Well, the Merc claims to have 302 bhp but it feels a HELL of a lot more powerful than the Caddy. Anyway, this doesn't last for long so I can get out and stretch my legs....at a petrol station. Fuel consumption for this V8 is simply abysmal. I am rarely getting more than 18mpg and that's with fairly gentle driving. Remember that 1 UK gallon is 4.5 litres and at present, 1 litre of regular petrol here costs 70p (down from 83p) $1. Thus one US gallon costs $3.50 here. (1 US gallon = 3.5 litres)

The ride is OK, but it is certainly no magic carpet. The Towncar is far superior, no contest. 

The handling feels pin sharp on twisty roads, but the steering does feel slightly inert around the dead ahead position on motorways. It also has a tendency to wander in wind or follow tramlines.

Do I think this car is worth �70,000 including extras? Considering the quality, a reasonable price to pay maybe around �35-40,000 unless they ramp up build quality and replace those nasty, nasty interior plastics and rotten design. Mercedes cannot trade on cachet anymore these days.

Don't get me wrong, I welcome change and progress with open arms - but only for the better. People cutting corners and charging too much is not the sort of change I like to see. It is simply a typical accountant's manoeuvre. Believe me, I know!

Welcome to the 21st Century.
