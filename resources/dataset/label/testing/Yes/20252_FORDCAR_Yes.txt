            I was looking for a quality used 4x4 in 2001 and looked at a number of vehicles: Nissan Pathfinder, Jeep Cherokee, Chevy Blazer and then I came across a full-size '90 Eddie Bauer Bronco (not to be confused with the compact Bronco II).  It has more power, interior space, utility and reliability than all the others, and it costs less.
It needed a little routine work at first (new tires, steering box adjustment, tailgate window work*) but has given me no problems whatsoever since.
On the road, it's got plenty of power and rides very smoothly.  Off-road, it's virtually indestructible and nearly impossible to get stuck thanks to a great 4WD system.
The original paint job still shines like new and the interior is easy to keep clean.
I'd recommend it highly.

* - On the tailgate window, it's a common problem with the full-size Broncos.  If you're at all mechanically inclined, it can be fixed within an hour with $5 worth of parts and instructions available at a Bronco website.  Otherwise, it may run you a few bucks to have a shop fix it, but chances are it will happen at some time or another.
