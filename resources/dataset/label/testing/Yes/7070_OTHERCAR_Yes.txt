            FYI:  This is my first digital camera, and my first attempt at serious photography.  Getting quick snaps with a disposable camera don't really count.  

After reading several reviews of this camera online, I decided to purchase the Fuji 4700 zoom in an online auction, which came with an extra 64MB chip.  I figured out how to use the camera pretty quickly,the manual is quite easy to go through.  

My first couple of pictures were blurred, I had only used disposable cameras before.  But after a while, I learned how to keep still (and to use objects as tripods when possible), especially for night mode.  I also had set the resolution and picture quality too high, and couldn't take that many pictures.  I set the resolution to 1280, and the picture quality to normal, and got some great shots..

I was a bit disappointed in the color depth of the camera, the colors (bright greens of leaves, for example) seemed kind of dull.  But at a friend's suggestion, I used automatic saturation adjustment in a computer program called Paint Shop Pro, and this gave realistic colors.

My only complaints are: that the movie mode's sound is pretty choppy, but you would use a real camcorder to record something sound intensive like a piano recital!  The batteries need to be charged overnight if you plan on using the camera for extended periods of time; using the display screen eats up the battery power!
