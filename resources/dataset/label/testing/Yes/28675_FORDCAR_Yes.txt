            1994 E-350 Clubwagon Chateau, 460 V-8, E4OD, 4.09:1, factory quad seating, 6-way power driver's seat, lumbar support front seats, 8700# GVWR, rear heat and a/c, luxury in every way.

Background...I have owned and driven Ford vans since I was 16 years old.  I started out with a 1970 E-200 with 240 cid I-6.  I have owned Ford vans with almost every engine available in them.  I have used Ford vans for solo  commuting, recreation, hauling band members and band equipment, hauling merchandise for distribution, hauling frieght in the &quot;Just In Time&quot;  expedited frieght business, hauling students, and now pulling my 25' travel trailer.

Currently...I bought my '94 E-350 Clubwagon Chateau (you can see it http://www.pathway.net/harmonicat/chateau.jpg ) expressly to pull the travel trailer.  The 460 is a powerhouse with 245 hp, and 400 ftlbs torque.  The E4OD transmission seems to be a good one.  I don't find it hunting as other people have complained about in other forums.  The 4.09:1 differential feels more &quot;gear bound&quot; than higher gear sets I have had in the past, but it still cruises along at 70 and 75 and gets 13 mpg at that.  The best economy that I have gotten with this van is 13 mpg hwy w/o trailer, and 9 mpg w/trailer.  My Chateau package includes the OEM quad seating, 7-passenger arrangement.  I have found the OEM seats are better constructed than the after-market seats in conversion vans.  The 6-way power driver's seat and lumbar support is so nice when driving a long distance in a short time.  I am 6' tall and find that raising the seat will extend my legs just right for taking on a 5 hour trip without stopping.  Also, the lumbar support keeps my back in firm, proper alignment.  

This van pulls the 25' travel trailer with little or no effort.  In fact even when pulling the largest of hills, I still have power left to accelerate.<br><br>
