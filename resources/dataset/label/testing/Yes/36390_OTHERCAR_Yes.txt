            This Out Classes ,Ford Sporttrack,Nissian crewcab,Toyota Tacoma ,all the mid & mini crew cab`s! I Test Drove All Of These Truck`s. All But The Ford Are Under Powered.The Ford Is Tall And Narrow,Wish It Looked More Like a Ranger With 4 Doors.I did consider a 2001 tacoma, but you can only buy them one way ,LOADED ! for 25,000. I got the Dodge for 5,000 less.Only wanted V8,auto,Air,& 16" tires, really Like The V8 Power,Styling etc.The toyota is a fine truck but to much money and only avil. with V6.Ordered Dodge with Quick Order Pkg.26B,& Sport Plus Group,SPG gives you 16" Good-years,sway brace rod,A/C,Alloy Wheel`s. I Really LOVE This TRUCK !!!!! Got Mine At WWW.CARSDIRECT.COM They had a $2,000.00 Rebate at the time. good hunting, JJ
