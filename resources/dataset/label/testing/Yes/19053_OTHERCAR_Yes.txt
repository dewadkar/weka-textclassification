            The Olympus C-2020 Zoom is a great digital camera. Unlike some newer models that operate like binoculars or PDAs, this camera knows its a camera. Controls are laid out logically. The only real nitpick is the menuing system is a little confusing; this camera does have a learning curve. (This is especially true if you start changing the resolutions, since this process is highly non-intuitive in this camera). But after about 15 minutes, you won't have to look at the quick-start guide again.

Unlike some of the digital cameras I've used, this Olympus is a real joy to handle. The batteries last a good length of time, and the LCD monitor is large enough so you can operate it at arms' length still see what you are aiming at. The write-time to the SmartMedia card is, however, a little slow.

The new features for this series, including the black-and-white mode, sepia and QuickTime movie mode, are fun to play with but don't have real practical purposes. It's really easier just to shoot everything in color, then manipulate them on your PC.

I did find myself using the in-camera picture-stitching function, where you can take several panorama photos and stitch them into one giant photo.


Pluses 
  Good battery life, and it comes bundled with the camera
  Excellent image quality
  Big, bright viewfinder
  In-camera photo stitching
  Comes with all necessary cables and accessories, including batteries and charger.

Minuses:
  The camera is very noisy when turned on.
  USB should be standard on cameras of this quality.
  Slow write-speeds to media
  The 8Mb media is a little meager. 16Mb would be better.
  Cumbersome menuing takes some getting used to.

At more than $700, however, it's still a little pricey. As 3 megapixel cameras come on the market -- including Olympus' new 3030 -- you can expect prices to start dropping soon.<br><br>
