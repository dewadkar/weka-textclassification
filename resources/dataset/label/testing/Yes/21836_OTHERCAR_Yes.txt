            I truly love this car.  It looks great and provides an excellent ride and performance.  With the 6 speed, it has incredible acceleration.  I traded in a Cadillac Eldorado with the Northstar so I am no stranger to torque steer but I can say it is probably more manageable than the Caddy was.  The Meridian Package includes heated leather seats and I would highly recommend that.

Now the the real problem I need to warn people about which is the BOSE stereo.

I have had my car for 10 months and I am about to get my 4th head unit. On the original one, the CD Player died completely after 3 months and it took 2 1/2 months to get the first replacement.  Then after 1 month, the left channel went out only when playing CD's while the left channel was fine when using the radio.  That again took another 2 months to get another replacement.  The last replacement lasted 2 weeks before it would not play, load, or unload. I don't imagine that I will even be able to get my CD's out.  

I complained to Nissan North America customer service and received a bunch of malarcky that BOSE said that units shipped prior to 30 days ago had problems with "bending pins" and that they had revised their shipping packaging. I told them that was obviously not the problem because if that was the case, it would not play on installation, not go bad later. I was told the only thing they could do is replace it and they again can provide no ETA of arrival on next one. They also had the guts to tell me that they had no significant history of issues from other customers when I am finding disgruntled customers all over the maxima bulletin boards with exactly the same problem.

Needless to say, I think BOSE is selling Nissan junk and they are pretty much accepting it and passing it along to their customers at over $1,000 a pop.  Again, I love the car but this situation really stinks.  I believe that not only about the equipment but more importantly, the manner in which the problem is being handled.  In a machine as complex as a car with thousands of parts, it is highly likely that there are going to be suppplier and manufacturing problems.  But I believe that it is the manner in which the company reacts that shows their true sense of commitment to customers and Nissan and Bose have definitely dropped the ball on this one.

I will recommend the car to anyone but they need to know that the $1,099.00 for the stereo is not worth $.02. I imagine that I will replace with an aftermarket when the next one goes, noting that I didn't say IF but WHEN. I hope that maybe someone else will read this and be forewarned.

Thank you for the opportunity.
