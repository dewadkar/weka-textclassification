            I drive between 60 and 70,000 miles per year, and I need a car that is reliable, comfortable, and economical. I bought a 1992 Passat GL, with all the bells and whistles, used with 30,000 miles on it. I instantly fell in love with the car for all the above reasons. After two and a half years the car had 180,000 miles on it, without any major problems. I still had the original brakes .
I would recommend a Passat to anyone that does a lot of driving, or needs lots of space, the trunk is huge. I used to get as high as 40 MPG on the highway cruising. I would have bought another Passat, but my high mileage depreciates cars too fast, so I settled on a Jetta GT, 1997 model new. See my opinion in the Jetta column.
My only complaint is the cost of parts, but then after 5 Mazda 626 's parts for all cars are getting to be very expensive.<br><br>
