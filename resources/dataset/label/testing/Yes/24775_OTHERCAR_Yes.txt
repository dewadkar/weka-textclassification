            We purchased this camera shortly before the birth of our son.  Since most of our family lives a number of hours away, we wanted to be able to share as much of his life with them as possible.

Here are the things I like about the camera:
Size - It is so small!  Smaller than my 35mm.  Easily fits in purses, pockets and diaper bags!

Picture Quality - We usually shoot with the medium quality and I am regularly amazed at the quality of my prints.  Even when you zoom in on a picture you have already taken.

Ease of use - Even though in my traditional fashion have not touched the instruction manual, I have been able to easily figure out the functions.  I am sure there are some that I don't know about yet, but I will leave that to my husband to read and tell me about.

Easy upload - You simply insert the cable into the camera, push a button on the camera and your pictures are on your computer.

Price - I found it to be very reasonable for what you get...a great little camera and easy to navigate software.

Things that could be better...
Shutter lag - If you have ever tried to take a picture of a newborn or infant, you know you have to shoot fast!  I have missed a couple of great shoots due to shutter lag.  Luckily I have captured more than I have missed.

Camedia software - Very easy to use, but I wish it had more flexibility with prints as far as combo prints.  For example, I would like to have a 5x7, 3x5, and some wallets on one sheet.  It does have some options for combo prints, but I think they could have included more.

Other comments on the camera:
Battery life seems average to me.  Notice that it does last longer if you don't use the LCD screen often.  I usually use the regular view finder and rarely review my pictures on the camera.  I just shoot away and then review the pictures on my pc and delete any I do not want. I have never kept track of how many exposures I get though.

Also wanted to note that I do get a lot of comments when I am using the camera in public.  Many are surprised by its size (like I said above, it is smaller than most 35mm) and if I show them some of the pictures I have taken on the LCD screen and zoom in, they are amazed at the quality of the pictures.
