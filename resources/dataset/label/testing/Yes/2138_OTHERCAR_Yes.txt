            My daughter and her husband own VW Golfs diesel. They bought their year 2000 Golf just a few months ago, with heated seats and air condition. They live in Winnipeg which has cold winter weather. 

The 1985 Golf they originally owned went to 500K  before it was stolen and wrecked.This car had paid for itself twice over ,great mileage , and good service at the VW dealer (Autohaus -Pembina Highway ) .

 The new one is an automatic diesel complete with auto lock doors, alarm and security alert. The dash is digital and the layout is easy to read. The warning lights/symbols are easily understood and are easily noticed if a problem starts. The display lights up as the car is started and the symbols turn off when the car starts.

The large side windows offer a good view of the space around the car. The automatic Golf has not  been as good on  mileage  as the old Golf but still a great car and is giving  good service . This car is very comfortable and the baby car seat is easily installed and removed with all the attach points well placed for easy access.

The ABS  brakes are impressive which allows good road handling as well with brakes applied as running. The ABS system  has  a gentle bumping  sensation against the foot peddle to let you know it's working. The engine runs quieter than the previous models , I suspect the noise padding has improved.
This is a great car for the small family and couples who like to take others with them on trips . The optional seats are an exceptional quality rib pattern  cloth and the heated front seats are a joy to the posterior.This is a great touring car. The tires with this model are high performance all season tires and have been great in snow and wet streets. 

Volkswagen has done a nice job to make this a good looking and practical car for a family up to five to enjoy for a long time. This car has been a good investment and the family expects to be putting in excess of 50 to 60 thousand kilometers on the car per year for the next 10 years. 

This is a car you can expect to drive for a long time. Take one for a test drive you will be as happy as we are to have one in the family.<br><br>
