            I just took delivery of my new Spec-V on May 22, 2002.  I bought the Vibrant Blue version, although I almost didn't because of the red and black interior.  It turns out, however, that there is an available black leather seat upgrade that can be had and dealer-installed, so I took the blue and decided to see if I could live with the red seats.  Believe it or not, the interior actually looks kind of cool against the blue exterior.  If I ever decide that this is the only con to the car, at least there is a remedy available.

The power of the car is just what I thought it would be, leaving me with no complaints there.  After reading the reviews of what others claimed to be a somewhat sloppy 6 speed shifter, I have to admit that mine works just fine, and I'm not really an easy sell.  Although I read in another review that this is the same 6 speed that is found in the Maxima, it actually is not.  While the Spec V tranny is not a close ratio version like the Max, 1st gear is low enough and the engine is powerful enough, that my girlfriend Kathie, who could never drive a stick before because of hundreds of off-the-line engine stalls, is well on her way to mastering a six speed.

The fit and finish of the car are more than just good enough.  Ride quality, although tighter than the regular Sentra and Sentra SE-R, is still very livable.  The suspension provides great cornering ability and gives you a real feeling of being in control.

My car was equipped with everything you can possibly get.  I found the audio fanatic package with the 300 watt Rockford Fosgate amp to be more than adequate.  Although the subwoofer doesn't seem to have the same punch as the ear-shattering examples installed in the cars that my children's friends own, I prefer my bass to be cleaner and less boomy anyway.

As for the ABS brakes, somewhere in Rocky Point, N.Y. there is a dog that is still alive today because after he jumped in front of my car while I was doing 60 MPH, I was able to jump on my brake pedal as hard as I could and miss hitting him.  Hopefully I will never have to test the side airbags.

My Nissan dealer, in Patchogue, New York, hooked me up with my car for what I thought was a very reasonable $18,400.  Considering what that amount of money buys these days, it's an awful lot of car for the money and I highly recommend it.
