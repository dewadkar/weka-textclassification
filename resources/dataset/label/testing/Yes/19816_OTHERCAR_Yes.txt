            One month ago I purchased a brand new 2000 Cougar.  It is Laser Red and came with the sports package.  It has the 16&quot; wheels, the cool spoiler in the back... and its just loaded with accessories.  It came with a 6 disc changer, but I like to have my own sterio equipment installed.  I put in a MTX subwoofer box with 3 10&quot; woofers.  Its hooked up with the factory speakers, a 60 watt alpine head unit, and a 800 watt fossgate amp to the woofers, and a 200 watt fosgate amp to the speakers.  OH MY GOD does it pound.  If you like a crazy system like I do, this is it.  This is by far the best sounding system I have ever heard, and im not just saying that.  But back to the car... it takes turns like I like to take them (hard, and fast)  It is very sturdy and never ever feels like it is going to even tilt the slightest bit.  It picks up on the highway better than a V8 and I got the V6.  The foglights and rims that come with the sport package are a must because it looks sooo hooked up at night!  The CAT gives a very smooth ride, and I think it looks better than any other car out there.  I have friends with mustangs and camero's, and they are jealous of MY Cougar!  Seating in the back can be a little tight, but if the driver and passanger are not that big, it will be quite comfy back there in the bucket seats.  I am 6'1&quot; and I need the seat to be back quite a bit, and my friends in the back say that it is fine.  I definately give this car <br><br>
