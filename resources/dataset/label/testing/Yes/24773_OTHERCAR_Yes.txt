            Overrall a very good camera for someone who wants to have the camera help as much as possible to take good photographs under difficult conditions.

Here I will try to answer questions that are not answered by the Olympus Data Sheet or the early reviews. All tests were taken with an Olympus 128Mb card.

Shot Delay
One of the disappointments when moving from film to digital photography is the delays, delays to first shot and delays between shots. It&#146s a lot faster than my first digital (Ricoh4200 &#150 painfully slow, guzzled power, fantastic photos) but not as fast as my FujiS602 (5 photos per second). When set to SQ Mode it will take one photo per second for ten seconds. The only disturbing thing is that the LCD goes completely black. Surprisingly this continuous mode also works with flash &#150 it just slows down to around one photo every four seconds. One advantage about the one second delay is that you can leave Continuous mode on permanently &#150 press the shutter and it takes a photo and displays it for two seconds, hold the shutter and it takes one photo per second with the LCD off until you let go or ten photos have been taken. If you take a single shot you will be able to take a photo approximately every three settings.
	The time to first shot after turning the camera on is specified at 2 seconds, but if I start a stopwatch as I open the cover then the first photo says 4 seconds !

Macro mode
You can also leave macro mode on permanently, it will still focus to infinity but just taking a bit longer than in normal mode. The review that says that Macro range is 0.2 to 0.5 metre is wrong. Auto focussing and flash work very well over the whole macro distance and the whole zoom range.

Panorama Mode
What a rip-off is my reaction. All it does is superimpose some blue rectangles on the viewfinder. From the brief, vague description I got the impression that helped compose shots by overlaying a part of the previous frame, but no. You still have to remember where the previous shot ended to line up the next one. Don&#146t bother spending any extra money to buy an Olympus XD Card to get Panorama Mode !
