             Well I have owned My 98 cutlass for exactly one Year today (Happy Birthday Car)And I still love this car.It has gone on long trips with my parents 4 times.My parents said that is was the best car for long travels they have ever rode in.It rides very smoothly and It is very easy to drive.It has plenty of leg room and trunk space.
  I bought this car after owning a 98 saturn,I owned the Saturn for 8 months and really wanted something a little larger.So when I saw this car I knew it was what I wanted.I really dont know how to explain what is like to drive ,but this might help. I HATE TO DRIVE,really I dislike driving.But This car changes that.I love to drive my olds.I have a sister who owns a 87 cutlass and the changes were done very well.I realize there is a 12 year difference.But it really made me see how far they have come in car design.Other than the name you cant tell they are the same car,except for one thing.How well they run.My sisters car is pretty beat up,but still runs like it just came off the lot.I have had no major problems with this car at all.
   The only thing I have found that I dont like is where the put the ash tray.I realize that you should not smoke but if you do this car is set up a little weird.It has a  removeable ash tray that sits on the center console,that is very hard to use when you are driving.There is also a retractable cup holder next to the steering wheel that I also found to be very awkward,so I keep my ash tray in that and use the holder in the center for drinks.
    One really cool feature on the Cutlass is lights that turn on when you start the car.They are daytime running lights during the day and they have a light sensor and they get brighter as the outdoor light fades.I will tell you that is a great feature,you dont have to worry about having a dead battery because you forgot to turn your headlights off.
    In closing I would like to say that I am very unhappy with Oldsmobile's choice to discontinue this cars production.It has been one of the cars that makes you think of oldsmobile.I truly hope they bring them back in the years to come.So I will keep this one untill they do.<br><br>
