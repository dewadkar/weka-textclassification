            I did a lot of research when looking at digital cameras.  My main goal was for printing pics.  A digital camera is worthless to me unless I can print quality pics.  For this kind of investment I didn't want to throw $450 in the toilet.  

So buying the printer was just as important as the camera.  I bought an Epson photo printer as well the 740.  I got a $50 rebate because of the combo.  

I have not been disappointed with either.  Always put the camera on the highest resolution about 1800 pixels and the pix are good.  Outside pics are better, but they are hard to take as the viewer is hard to see in the sunlight.

The pics will not be as crisp as 35mm film, but they are more fun and are very acceptable. Another tip - use photo quality paper.

My wife who was computer illiterate has even spent hours having fun taking and printing her own pics.  The software it comes with is very easy to use.   

Easily a four star camera<br><br>
