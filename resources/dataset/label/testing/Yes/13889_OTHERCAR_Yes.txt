            <b>Personal Experience</b>
I am a very big Saturn fan. But I have to be honest about my experienced with my SC2. I love the car, but my particular car was plagued with problems...and made me end up trading it in after a year of ownership. This was a negative $5,000 trade in value. However, I know other people with exact same car and they haven&#146t had any problems like mine.

<b>Overview</b>
The 2001 Saturn SC2 has just been redesigned for 2001. It features a new sporty aggressive design that really makes it stand at and look unique. It also features Saturn innovative RAD (rear access door), to easily let passengers into the back seat of the coupe. The engine has undergone more refinements to quiet it down and provide a less harsh interior vibration. The interior has changed very little since 95 with only minor changes to the layout and dash design.

<b>Pricing</b>
While new this car cost fully loaded just above $20,500. You can now find them used for around $11,000-13,000. So the price new I think is too high for what you get but used you can get a great deal that the original owner didn&#146t get.

<b>Engine</b>
The engine is the DOHC 1.9L 124HP engine. This engine has been in the Saturn&#146s since day one, with major refinements in 96 and smaller ones every year after that. The engine provides adequate acceleration (much better than the base Honda Civic) but for cars priced around 20K I wouldn&#146t recommend it. With the automatic transmission the engine goes into overdrive a little more than I would like. Which makes it sounds like it&#146s under a lot of strain when there is usually power to spare.

<b>Exterior</b>
You can&#146t go wrong with polymer. Saturn's since day one have features polymer side body panels. That provides a dent and ding resistant surface. I have found myself several times kicking or hitting my car to show people how resistant the doors really are. If you don&#146t take my word for it go to your local Saturn retailer and give the cars a good hit (make sure its not an L-Series, those feature rear quarter metal panels). The coupe has a built in spoiler which looks good, but I like higher spoilers which you can purchase with the new expression series for the coupe. It fits right over the factory spoiler and looks very good. The SC2 has clear lines that make the coupe look even more attractive. 

<b>Interior</b>
The steering wheel is kind of plain. The dash and other interior parts are made out of plastic. In between the instrument cluster and the top of the dash there is a very noticeable gap that you want to look for. There has been a TSB (technical service bulletin) on this and is caused my warped plastic. The stereo and other controls are laid out in a good manner no complaints there. The seats however are not that comfortable, and adjusting the seat during driving isn&#146t easy. Turning the handles that adjust the seat can be fairly hard an easier system of a power seat option would have been preferred. Also one thing to note is that a vibration sound began to develop at 18K that could not be found coming from the rear window. 

<b>Ride Quality</b>
Saturn should ditch the Firestone Firehawk tires. They provide a somewhat bad ride quality in the SC2. Replacing the tires will provide you with a much more pleasant driving experience. The coupe takes turns like a pro, no complaints there. The braking could be a little better, and you should expect to start feeling a pulsing in your brakes around 8K due to warped rotors (which is a common problem that plagues gm). Buying aftermarket rotors will solve this problem and save you the hassle and the decreased ride quality.

<b>Features</b>
The SC2 doesn&#146t offer too many extra features most are standard. A standard SC2 offers you air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, power door lock w/ keyless entry and alarm, power mirrors, cd player with 4 speakers, fog lights, rear spoiler, and leather wrapped steering wheel. Upgrades include head curtain air bags, abs/traction control, sunroof, and leather appointments. I think Saturn could use a few more extra's such as power seat, premium audio system, heated mirrors (all which can be found in the L-Series cars).

<b>The Negative</b>
The automatic transmission is not as smooth as I would expect it to be. The interior quality isn&#146t acceptable for a car priced at or above 20K. The firestone firehawk tires are terrible and provide very poor traction on rainy days. Interior rattles and sounds should be monitored and checked before any purchase. Brakes should be checked to make sure new rotors are not required. Another thing that you also should have checked is the alternator. That has been a past problem that has plagued Saturn.
