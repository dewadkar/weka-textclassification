            This car has been a family member for 11 years now.  I haven't really been in the newer ones but if they are anything like mine, I would have to say go buy one.  Not only is my Taurus roomy and big, it also is pretty safe.  I haven't been in any car crashes personally but I have seen people with my car who have.  It's a safe car, you have this balloon cushion thing going on around you since it's so huge.  A warning to beginner drivers though: It is impossible to parallel park.  The size of this car just makes it very difficult to see where you are going and how close you are to the curb.  Also, when they hit ten years, they start to have a lot of problems with the heating and cooling system.  Ours just recently sprung four leaks where anti freeze is dripping out.  This isn't an isolated case; many of the older Tauruses have problems with heating and cooling, and the bills to pay for it can grow very quickly (another problem we're experiencing).  Overall, this is a great car, takes a while to accelerate but then again it's a whale on wheels.  Good car for families.<br><br>
