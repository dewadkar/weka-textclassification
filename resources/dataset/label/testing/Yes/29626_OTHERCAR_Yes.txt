                I owned a Nissan Sentra for almost five years before we purchased our Quest. I never had any trouble with it at all! Needless to say, I felt I should be loyal to Nissan! As far as I am concerned, certain other car manufacturers owe me a car for the trouble I've gone through with them! But my brother is a car salesman so I had to check out the Dodge too.
    The Nissan was $ 3,000.00 less with more features - like the rear audio (something the Dodge does not have at this point). Also, I was trading in the Nissan Sentra so Dodge offered me $ 1,500.00 for it.  Nissan gave me $ 3,400.00 for the Nissan Sentra! That is quite a difference! I know that the Dodge is a bit bigger but I think those few cubic feet are not worth the price difference. Not to mention the peace of mind that I have with a Nissan. 
    The TV/VCR unit that comes with the vehicle is wonderful for my two kids and we have taken three long car trips since we purchased it in May. The seats rearrange easily although it would be nice if the rear seat would come out completely. This is a wonderful vehicle for any type of family. It is roomy, quiet, and the ride is smooth.<br><br>
