            Recently I spent four days in Dallas, Texas and while I was there I rented a Mustang Convertible.  There were quite a few things I noticed, both good and bad.  This is was the V6 convertible with power windows and doors, automatic transmission, traction control (toggle switch) with cloth interior.

<b>Convertible Top</b>
I've never driven a convertible before so this was a new experience for me.  The top looked good and the mustang is one of the few cars I like the look of a soft top convertible.  The design for opening and closing the top is a good one.  Normally on a soft top if you try to open the top while the car is moving you can potentially damage the top and other components.  This car makes you set the parking brake before it allows the top to be moved up or down.

<b>Power</b>
I was not impressed by this engine.  In a car that is supposed to be an American Muscle car, I expected a nice punch in the seat when I stepped on the gas.  I never received this in the mustang.  It's most likely due to the weight of the vehicle.  Becuase this is a convertible it is a few hundred pounds heavier than the standard hard roof mustang which will affect it's acceleratiion at any given speed.  I found myself missing the accleration and power out of my four cylinder Acura while driving this car.  I tried multiple times to spin the wheels while turning hard in low gear with traction control OFF and could not do it.  Some people might say that's good for safety, but I'm thinking of sports car setup here and this was not acceptable.

<b>Handling</b>
Because this is a sports car I expected crisp handling and a tight suspension.  When I was driving on the highway and hit a bump this car bobbed and bounced all over the place.  I took a few hard corners and experienced quite a bit of body roll.  The car didn't break loose though which was good, but being a novice driver to this car I wasn't pushing it real hard.  While on the freeway making lane changes I could feel the body roll side to side which is an uncomfortable feeling.  

<b>Miscellaneous Items</b>
There a few pet peeves I have with this car that I just can not and could not get over this weekend.  The first is how small the trunk is.  The trunk size is decreased due to convertible top storeage, but I could hardly fit two suitcases in this trunk.  If I wanted to use this as my daily driver and take it on trips, I would be out of luck.  

Another thing I couldn't stand about this car was the fact that there is no keyhole for locking and unlocking on the right side of the car.  My friend owned a mustang and said that's because this car comes with keyless entry standard, but since I had a rental, keyless entry was not present.  If I were an owner and my cars keyless entry were to fail, I would be out of luck.  I don't even want to think about how bad it would be if the drivers door lock failed.  I'm sure it's not too much more to include a keyhole for locking/unlocking on the right side of the car, but it looks like this is a victim to typical Ford cost cutting. 

The glove box on this car is pretty big.  The car had it's owner manuals and other papers with books in the glove box, plus the hard case for my sunglasses and still closed with ease.  

The roof leaked!  I had the top closed and it began raining while I was driving one afternoon.  I noticed over to the right that it was now raining inside the car as well.  Luckily not on me, but not so lucky if I had a passenger in the car.  This is a $24,000+ car, and after 9147 total miles on the Odometer I would expect that the roof not leak.

Overall, the car has a few minor things that could use repairing, such as the keylock on the passenger side, leaky roof and slow engine with bouncy handling.  Actually, that's pretty much the whole car.  If you want a car that lives up to it's name and potential, this is not the mustang you want.  Try the GT or Cobra and you may be well rewarded.  I hear the Mustang Gt Convertible goes 0-60 in 5.7 seconds which is mighty quick.  If you want something reliable then I would recommend that you run, don't walk far away from any Ford Dealership.  <br><br>
