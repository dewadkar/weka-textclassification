            I am a co-founder of a website and I promised myself that the day we launched our site I would march down to my BMW dealer and lease a new 540i.  I have never had a sports car before (nor have I owned a BMW) - having always leased a Ford Explorer and most recently a Lexus LX 470 SUV.  This was going to be my treat!

Well. . .I was not disappointed!  This car was more than I expected.  I had read Road &amp; Track magazine and seen it ranked against the Mercedes 430, the Lexus GS400 and the new Jaguar.  The BMW came out on top - as well it should.

It handles like a dream.  If you think the acceleration from 0-60 is fast, try the acceleration from 40-90.  Other cars on the road stare in disbelief at the incredible power this car offers.  Just be careful!  It is really fast - so drive safely.  It handles like a dream, and comes with the Msport wheel.  I recommend the standard transmission because having an automatic transmission would be a waste of an experience.

My lease payments are about $1,100 per month (2-year lease) so it's not cheap.  But, then again, good things in life usually come at a price.  Treat yourself to this beauty and drive with respect.
