            The Saturn SL1 is a great car!  I bought it new in '95 and was completely happy with my purchase.  It gets good mileage, it is relatively cheap to fix, it holds its value, the factory stereo was surprisingly terrific, it handles extremely well in bad weather and most importantly, it's safe!!!  I was in a 65 mile an hour crash into a guard rail and while the car was totaled, I got out without a scratch.  I had a policeman AND a paramedic tell me that if I was almost any other car, I wouldn't have made it.  All the damage was done to the outside of the car.  The only minor flaw with this car is that is that the base model does not have intermittent wipers.  And that's a VERY minor problem!  The company was completely different from any other company (as you know from the commercials).  They have a night where they have refreshments and show you how to do work on your car which is really helpful for small problems.  How many dealerships give you that?  I didn't have it very long so I never had any problems with the car but I know from others who drive them that never have any problems.  There is plenty of room for 5 people and it seats tall and short people alike.  The trunk storage is also very large!  This is a really great car!<br><br>
