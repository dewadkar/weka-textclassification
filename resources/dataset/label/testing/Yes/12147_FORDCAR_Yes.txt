            Having been a loyal Ford truck owner for over 12 years, I am greatly disappointed in the new F-250 Crew Cab 4x4. My purchase was a special order following lots of homework reading every bit of information on the new Super Duty trucks and the V10. I ordered a fully loaded F-250 Lariat 4x4 short bed with the V10...every option available by Ford is on my truck. After a few months, it developed a lot of creaks and rattles in the front suspension and dashboard. Several trips to the dealer led to more trips to the dealer as they could not find the source of the problems. Finally, I brought the truck back to another dealer and they foun d several service bulletins on the areas of problems I had...the truck has been fixed. They put spring isolators in between the leafs and reattached a wiring harness in the dash. Other recalls include the speed control and fuel filler valve. I have also had numerous problems with other cosmetic and non-mechanical items...

My main problem with this truck is the motor. I thought the V10 would be an ass-kicker, but I think my old 460 was better...more torque and responsiveness. The V10 feels &quot;tinny&quot; and &quot;hollow&quot; compared to the old big block. The gas mileage is about 10-12.5 mpg with the V10. 

The overall ride is pretty good on the freeway, but there is a lot of body lean on turns...it is very annoying. I ask Ford...Why the hell is the turning radius so terrible? Why can't you make the steering wheel turn a little more so the front wheels turn more??? There are only 2 places in Orange County, CA that the Ford F-250 crew Cab can make a u-turn; Anaheim Stadium and John Wayne Airport...<br><br>
