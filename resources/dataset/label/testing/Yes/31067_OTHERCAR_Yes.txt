                 I own a 1999 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner and after purchasing it I quickly decided I needed something with more room.  Naturally I first considered the Toyota Tundra given the reliability I've had with my smaller Tacoma.  However, just to be absolutely sure I always do a great deal of comparison research before I make a purchase.  So I began comparing the new Tundra to the other full-size pick up competitors.  In the course of my research I discovered some rather eye-opening facts.  While Tundra is a good comparison related to the Ford and Dodge line up of trucks they fall well short when compared to the Chevy line up.
     Options that are standard on the Chevy are not even available on the Tundra.  For example, 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS is standard on &quot;all&quot; Chevrolet trucks.  Four wheel disc is not even an option on the Tundra and ABS is a $600 extra.  Keyless remote entry is available on most of the full-size chevy line up.  On the other hand I have personally test driven a $26,000 Tundra on which keyless entry was not available.  The rear seat in the extended cab Tundra is at a 90 degree angle and about as comfortable as leaning up against a wall.  Long trips are not recommended back here.  The extended cab chevy however has not only more room in the back but also more comfortable seats.  Stereos in the Chevrolet trucks include and ambient noise feature that increases and decreases the volume level of the stereo automatically as ambient noise in the cab changes due to wind or road noise.  Stereos in the Toyota line up have never been anything outstanding and the Tundra is no exception.  Even their top of the line stereo did not impress me when compared to stereos in most other vehicles.  Especially in light of how much they want for it.
     The Toyota dealer here locally does install a good bed liner, especially compared to the bedliner offered in the Chevy trucks.  However, anyone wanting a regular cab Tundra will have to live with the longer bed since Toyota has designed this truck on only one frame for both regular and extended cab models.  Chevrolet on the other hand offers the short bed on the regular cab, which I personally prefer.
     As far as engine performance both trucks offer a very good V8.  The 4.6 liter V8 in the Tundra is quick and smooth.  The 5.3 liter V8 in the Chevy is equally is powerful and generates a great deal of torque.  In the V6 versions the Chevrolet wins hands down.  Having driven both I can personally atest to the fact that you really have to put your foot into the V6 Tundra to get it running.
     The dash board layout and ergonomics in the Chevrolet, I felt, was superior to the Tundra.  Gauges are marked in increments rather then just general idea settings.  The temp. gauge has degrees in the Chevy rather then just &quot;C&quot; and &quot;H&quot; at extremes of the gauge as in the Tundra.  This is typical of the way Toyota likes to lay out their gauges.  The message center available on the Chevy trucks that warns drivers of various different functions within the truck is a much noticed improvement over the Tundra.
     The single biggest difference between these two trucks is undoubtedly cost.  Toyota asks a great deal of money for their trucks while offering fewer features then the Chevy.  While they do offer good reliability and an excellent ride I don't think that justifies the higher price.
