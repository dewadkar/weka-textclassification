                 The Porsche 944 that I bought is a great car.  It handles excellent in town or on the highway.  It takes normal 90 degree corners with great control.  As you turn the corner the seats hold on to you and don't let you slide around at all.  The harder you drive the car, the better it handles.  I would not recommend driving it hard though or you will be in the shop.  It does cost quite a bit of money to fix if you do break it.  The car has a removable sunroof that easily fits into the hatchback.  It comes with the average spare tire.  You know, those little tiny ones.  The 924 made the crossover in 1983 to turn into the 944 the only difference was that the front fenders were made out of galvanized steel on the 944.  On the 924 they were only made of plastic.  That makes the 944 easier to take a wax job too.  The plastic will not take it at all.  
     I have owned a few cars in my time and the is, without a doubt, the best one ever made.
