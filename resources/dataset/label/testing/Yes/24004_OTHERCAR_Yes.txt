            I first became interested in Honda's when my Grandfather purchased his '86 Accord LXi sedan.  When it finally came time for me to buy a reliable car to start a family with, and Accord was my first choice.  I settled on a '92 LX sedan with automatic for a few reasons.  First, I was moving to a bigger city and didn't want the hassle of shifting in traffic.  Second, EX model Accords were out of my price range.

I've owned the car approximately 4 years and have put about 45,000 miles on it.  Even though it has almost 113k miles on it (purchased with approximately 69k) the car runs and drives like new.  Since purchasing the car I have changed the timing belt, replaced the tires and front brakes, and had the recommended services completed.  The only modifications I've done to the car is add an after market stereo, alarm, and a towel to cover the back seat (to prevent cracking).  My only complaint thus far has to do with my heater knob.  I'm currently on my third one and will need to replace it very soon.  I don't think that I will ever sell or get rid of this car.

Incidentally, a few months later I purchased an Accord EX coupe with 5 speed and rear wing.  I can attest to the fact that this car is peppier than my LX but not so much as I would choose one car over the other.  The same modifications and repair work have been done to this car as well with one exception:  the sunroof had to be replaced (a long story that I won't go into detail here).
