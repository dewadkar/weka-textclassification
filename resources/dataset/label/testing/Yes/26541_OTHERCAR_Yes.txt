            I have heard people mention the new 2.2 liter engine isn't powerful enough on the road.  Perhaps, with an automatic transmission this is true, but with a manual transmission it has more than enough acceleration and top speed.  

I do most of my driving in the city, and yet I still get around 27 MPG.  I have a toneau cover, so I might be getting a few extra MGP because of this, but still, the MPG are great, and it drives very quietly.


The only cons I have about the truck are the ride can get a bit bumpy when going over bad roads, and the tires that come equiped with it (the Uni-royals) are wearing out rather quickly. 

In conclusion, for someone who is looking at getting a truck just so they have a vehicle that can carry stuff a car can't when need-be, and if you want a truck that gets outstanding gas milage, I would definatly recomend this truck.
