            I have owned just about every kind of vehicle you can imagine,from 68,69 Camaros, Ford &amp; Chevy Pickups,Hondas to Jaguar VDPs and I must say that JEEP vehicles are overall the best you can buy. 
  My first Jeep was a 87? Cherokee that I sold at 180K miles. Not that their was anything wrong with it, I just wanted a Mustang GT. The next Jeep I bought was a Wrangler that I put 156K on - also pretty much trouble free. This leads me up to our present Jeep vehicle a 95 Orvis Grand Cherokee 4X4 with the 5.2L(318ci) V8.
  We bought this Jeep new in 95 and have since put 189500+ miles on it(Yes this is not a mis-print - One hundred eighty nine thousand five hundred). Even with that kind of miles it is still as solid as a rock. We have never had any major trouble with the Jeep and have no complaints. We have taken our Orvis fourwheelin' in Colorado and have taken it on trips pulling trailers. It has plenty of power,yet gets an average of 16 mpg overall. Reliability ? Second to none ! The only time it has ever quit is when the battery died &amp; Jeep doesn't make the batteries ! I have changed battery ,brakes fluids ect but it is still on its original motor and trannie. 
   Next summer we will probably replace our Jeep and have done quite a bit of research on new SUV's and I will say that some of the competition may have a nicer finish(Land Rover &amp; Mercedes Benz)but no one builds a better sport utility than Jeep ! 
  If you don't plan on really using a SUV or or putting some serious miles on one,then choose whatever tickles your fancy. We put so many miles on a vehicle that we can't afford to buy one that wont stand up and that's why we've stuck with Jeep ! <br><br>
