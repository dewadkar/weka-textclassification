            I do like my Caravan and trust it enough to have gotten rid of my other 2 vehicles.  We purchased it used and out of necessity because we have 4 kids.  Not many cars can hold that many people comfortably.  Ours is a V6 3.0 engine, automatic transmission and front wheel drive.

Plusses:

1)  It holds 7 comfortably
2)  Standard size tires so you could purchase 4 new ones for about $100
3)  Good gas mileage, about 23 MPG
4)  Handles very well on long trips, our mileage is now 97,000.
5)  Minimal damage from being rear-ended at a high rate of speed.
6)  Cup holders for rear passengers built into side of van
7)  Rear seats removable for cargo
8)  Replacement parts not extravagant
9)  Water pump still running strong at 97,000 miles (knock on wood!!)
10) Heater works great
11) Handles well in steering and braking
12) Dual air bags

Minuses:

1)  A/C compressor gave out ($700+)
2)  We have &quot;manual&quot; windows which are a pain to roll up
3)  Rear seats - takes two to remove...heavy!
4)  Paint starting to fleck off
5)  Rear windshield washer froze up

Despite the negatives, I still feel you get a pretty good deal for the price. Maintenance cost is standard. 

**Just wanted to add an update - as of 11/12/00 our mileage is now at (drum roll please....) 118,890!!!**<br><br>
