            This is my husband's vehicle...so my experience is driving it in a pinch and paying the bills.  We purchased our '94 ranger new and have driving it for a daily 15 mile round trip commute every day since.  It has been a pretty dependable vehicle...nothing fancy.  We purchased the king cab version to have room for the kids...that wasn't a real bright move.  The jump seats in the back are not suitable for car seats and my 12 year old daughter has legs much to long for it to be suitable seating for her now.  The only real mechanical problems we've had are with the parking brake...it seems to slip constantly despite repeated trips to the dealer.  Otherwise it's been a relatively dependable vehicle.<br><br>
