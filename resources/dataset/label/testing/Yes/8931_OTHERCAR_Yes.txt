After wanting a minivan for years we were finally ready to purchase one. I had always loved the look of the caravan and after shopping around and doing research we decided this was the van for us!

We bought our caravan in August 1998 and have loved it since! It rides very nicely, drives like a car, is good on gas and looks great too! It is easy to get the kids in and out of, plus plenty of room for groceries and kid accessories. 

I also felt the price was very reasonable and I love everything about my van and would recommend it to anyone!
