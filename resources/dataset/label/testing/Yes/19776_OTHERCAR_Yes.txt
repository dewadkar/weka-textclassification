            When looking for a vehicle, what do you look for? If you try to find one with a reliable engine that could last forever, and Classic 1980's style, you may want to look in the direction of the Subaru Loyale Sedan. I've driven many a Subaru car and the Loyale was one of my favorite. From it's engine, to the great feel of driving it, and to the many amenities included, the 1992 Subaru Loyale stands out when compared to many other early '90s midsize sedans. 

<b>So, What's under the hood?</b>
The Subaru Loyale has Subaru's legendary 1.8 Liter, horizontally opposed overhead cam engine. It is driven by 90 horses at 5200 RPM and has 101 Ft. Lb. Torque at 2800 RPM. It sports a Single-point Fuel injection Fuel Supply, compared to the Multi-Point Fuel injection system of it's brother the Legacy model. It has a compression ratio of 9:5:1 which is shared by the Legacy. It also sported a Fully independent suspension which adds to it's feel of driving. 

As far as the transmission goes, Standard was a 5-Speed Manual. The option was a peppy 3-Speed Automatic, which was on the one I drove. The fuel tank could carry up to 15.9 US Gallons of Unleaded gasoline. What is there to say about  the fuel economy? Well, on the Front wheel drive model, the Manual could do 25 Miles per Gallon City / 32 Miles per
Gallon (MPG) Highway* and the automatic could do 24 City / 26 Highway*. Now on the All wheel drive model, the manual was able to achieve 24 City / 29 Highway* and the Automatic was 22 City / 23 Highway*.

<b>Ohh, the Legroom!</b>
Upon first glimpse of the interior of the Loyale, it looks Small and cramped. It seems like you would have to be tall to drive the automobile, but it is quite the opposite. When seated in the Subaru, you can appreciate it's Legroom. In the front, you get 41.7 inches maximum and in the back 35.2 inches minimum. When concerning headroom, you receive a comfortable 37.6" in the front and 36.5" in the back. 

<b>1992 Subaru Features and options</b>
Sitting in the drivers seat, you will feel in control of the vehicle. You are not too low to the ground, but at the same time, not too high. The steering wheel bears a slight resemblance to it's older counterpart the 1980's GL, yet still does not have Air Bags. The entire Loyale line (1990-1994) did not have a standard Air Bag. The Gauge cluster is strategically placed and everything is clear to read. One feature was "Telltale" Monitor that displayed an overhead view of the car and would alert you of warnings (i.e. Door Ajar, etc.). I enjoyed that feature and really wish my Ford Aspire had it. 

Air Conditioning was standard on all Loyale models, and so was Power steering. If you are looking for Anti-Lock brakes or a drivers air bag, look elsewhere for they are not among
one of the many options of the Loyale. You can lock your doors and roll up you windows with the press of a button, because standard are power locks and windows. Now here is
what makes Subaru so famous, the Switch on the fly "On Demand" All wheel drive (AWD), it is also an option. The best part about this line is the "On Demand" All Wheel
drive for the vehicle does not need to be slowed down or stopped to switch into four wheel drive. It can be turned on while going 60 down the highway. The Loyale I drove did not have AWD, only the Front wheel drive. 

Talking of the Audio system would be a short and boring conversation. The '92 Loyale had an ETR 20 Watt AM/FM Stereo with Four Speakers. It was not of the best quality and I would recommend an aftermarket unit. There were other Subaru stereos that year but were not offered to the Loyale line. 

<b>My Experiences</b>
I was looking for a car awhile back and one I looked at was the Subaru Loyale. I drove near 80 miles to see it, and when I arrived, I was in love. The car was wonderful! it was in top mechanical shape and did not have a bit of rust on it. I also love the Box design of the '80s. There were two drawbacks however, No Airbags and it had 112,000 miles. Now, I wanted a car with Air Bags, but was willing to sacrifice that if I found a good deal (It still had seat belts and that is enough safety for me). Subarus are known to last forever and 100,000 was just getting broken in, but I was looking for a economy car with under 50,000 on it. It was a great deal for the price at $1650. The interior was extremely clean and an aftermarket Kenwood Cassette player was installed. As far as the speakers go, I nor the owner knew what they were. 

Next came the test drive. I was suspecting a rough ride, but had my hopes. When first started, it idled a bit hard (Saying that I mean it was a little bumpy). It handled well on the near highway, passing was not a chore. It was aligned and hugged the road as we sped up. Everything was perfect in exception to the miles on the odometer. 

After much consideration, we decided not to buy the car. I wanted a vehicle with less miles on it, because I drive long distances for my work and I did not want to risk anything. I left the Loyale for another day, for I knew it would come. 

<b>Conclusion</b> 
If you can find one in good condition, buy it. Rust was a common problem among these vehicles, even more if you live in a state like Minnesota with the Road salt, so be on the
look out for it. Next time you go used car shopping, consider the Subaru Loyale, it may be just what you need!
