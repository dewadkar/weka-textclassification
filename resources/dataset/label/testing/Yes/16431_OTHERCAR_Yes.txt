            I will tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!!!    I promise

I have had my Fuji Finepix 2400 for about 6 months now, and I havent had one problem, NOT ONE.

It was one of my larger purchases, but I must say, it was a smart one.
I love the camera because it comes with 
the zoom that noone can live without, 
a reasonable choice of picture size (on the camera, you can fine-tune with the software bundle they inclde)
A SLIDING LENS COVER ---- I felt this was really important at the time I bought my camera, because I didnt want to scratch the lens by accident sometime, so i chose the Fuji finepix 2400 over the 1400(which has no cover)

The price was reasonable at the time of my purchase, about 500 dollars (which included a $100 mail in rebate)
and the price has dropped accordingly over the time passed.

If you want a camera that will stand up to anything, and is super easy to use (for the beginner),
gives some functions that advanced users are looking for,
then this is definately a good choice, it was my first choice after about a month of watching prices and looking at stats.

Iy advice to you is that if this looks like it could work for you, then it will.   But if you come across any other review of another camera that is BETTER, then look into it a bit more.
And if you like what you see, then i say go for it.

Oh ,
If you want to get the most out of the camera, I suggest buying a Q2 quest charger, with NiMH batteries, it charges them in less then 3 hours if the batteries are not TOTALLY dead, if they are TOTALLY dead (though I have never gotten this to happen) it supposedly takes about an hour to two hours more to charge them over the norm 3 hrs.
they havent failed me yet, and I dont think they ever will.


SO.....
GO FOR IT!!  But if you find a better camera, look into it, and if its still better, then get that one. This is an older camera and technology advances at a great rate, so go with something newer if you fins something solid and reliable.  
Goodluck with your purchases and happy shopping!


Alright, due to a comment im changing this review up a little bit and im gonna give you the whole package deal here.

Features:
2.1 million pixel ccd  (2.1 megapixels)
3x optical zoom (better then digital zoom because it maintains high picture quality)
2.5x digital zoom
lightweight
1.6" LCD monitor
build in flash, autofocus
uses compact flash cards to store pictures (up to 350 or so 640 x 480 pics can fit on a 32 megabite card)
640 x 480(normal)
1024 x 768(basic normal fine)
1600 x 1200(basic normal fine)

words in brackets above represent the picture quality


it has so many modes on it that it would take me a whole day or probably around 12 pages of writing to describe it
so heres the gist of it
you have automatic mode (camera does the work for you)
and you have manual mode (you do the work and finetune your picture results)
it has redeye reduction
flash
no flash
multiple shot bursts
10 second timer
oncamera tools to view and zoom in on your pictures and delete them if you want.
indoor photos with incadesent light, outdoors with sun, without sun, darkness, shade, clouds.  (manual modes to choose from)

and it also has a macro function (allowing you to get right up close to something and take a picture without blur).

and it has extra optical zoom functions that allow you to soom in  to 1.5x  2.5x and 3x  along with the regular zoom in and out function
and its controls and ease of use is unparalelled by any other camera i know of. 
this is a truly amazing camera.
hope you appreciate the update.
