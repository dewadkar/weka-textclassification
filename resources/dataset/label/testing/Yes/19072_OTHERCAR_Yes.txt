            I have owned many digital camera's before owning the Olympus C-2020 Zoom camera an I found that it was truly a best buy! Huge fun, easy to use as a point-and-shoot camera, while also offering
plenty of manual control. A layman shutterbug will have hours and hours of fun learning
the highly tweakable manual settings -- digicams offer very efficient instant gratification
(improves your odds in taking better photos -- that you actually want to keep and share).
Within minutes of receiving the camera I was snapping off shots using the LCD as my
viewfinder of items in my house at night in low light (I already had additional AA NiMh
batteries ready and charged) -- these were shots you would not waste on a film camera.
Boy was I surprised just how nice they all came out in auto mode, zooming in, zooming
out, not even trying hard to hold the camera steady -- this was the test for my wife's
point-and-shoot dependency (and mine too ;^)... this camera passed with flying colors!!!
Having gone through the comparison of storage needs for a typcial vacation where you
might take 120 shots or so, I figured 128MB of smartmedia would suffice, so I easily got
over the fact that other cameras used the 340MB drive (the 2020z does not) -- besides I'm
on the side that believes you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. I also got over the
fact that this camera did not have a built-in USB port -- my initial short list only included
cameras with USB; trust me, an external reader is only $40 delivered, and if you exclude
the 2020z from your short list, as I almost did, you'll be squandering a chance to own one
of the best values at this point in time (then again maybe the 3030z will sell for under
$500 in another 10 months??? What will you do with all those pixels??) In my opinion,
it'll be at least another 2-3 years before significant advances in CCDs reach the mass
market (e.g. affordable). If you're on the brink and looking to spring for a digicam, the
2020z will satisfy immensely.<br><br>
