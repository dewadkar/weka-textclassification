            I recently purchased a 2004 Impala SS and found this site in the process of researching reviews etc of the 2000  Impalas. Thought I would add my comments:
This car has loads of room! I originally was looking at the Monte Carlos and Nissan Altimas. My family of 5 discovered that the Monte was not a smart option because of rear seat access and the Altima w/ the V6 and options just didn't suit me because Nissan wasn't offering anything off that "sticker". I decided to look at the Impala and new Malibu's. I am performance minded and somewhat old school there. The Impala SS is front wheel drive, but that Supercharger really adds the kick to off the line performance. The supercharged 3800 series II has been used for a few years in the Pontiac GTP's and proven to be reliable. The tuned suspension, stiffened body, heavy duty transmission and hp/torque on the SS makes this relatively large sedan handle like a car "should"! the looks of the SS package really spice up the exterior with blacked out badging, 17" Diamond wheels, spoiler, ground effects, and the leather interior is nice which also includes SS badging. I have to admit though I agree with some others that the interior plastics are somewhat on the tacky/cheap side. With the current rebates offered by GM it was hard to turn away from the car though. With rebates I was right at 25,000 for it. This is w/ leather, onstar, XM radio, power everything...the only option not included was a sunroof (which the wife didn't want). Remote start would be nice as the loaded Malibu had that!...
Well after my first tank of gas I am seeing 26.5 mpg (its rated 18-28). AND yes I stomped on it twice... once from a roll and once at highway speeds. The max torque (280) is reached at around 3600, so it is great at the low end. At the high end it is more then able to hold its own. This is no real wheel drive Impala SS 409... but HP/weight ratio beats the STOCK 94-96 LT1 Impala SS's. I realize that mods to the car can be done to increase performance to both the older SS's and the new FWD ones, and if done, $ for hp will go farther with the older Impala's. But this car meets family needs, is a good gas mileage car, and is FUN to drive.
