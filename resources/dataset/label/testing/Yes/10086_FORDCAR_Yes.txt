            I bought my new ranger xlt supercab 4drs flairside 4wd on 11-11-00. My truck came equipped with power, a/c, slider, off rd pkg, premium stereo, fog lights, tow pkg (comes with 4wd), cruise, and  much more.  Im a former 96 4wd ranger owner, and was pleased with the performance of that vehicle so I decided to upgrade.  My truck was equipped with the 3.0 liter 150 horsepower engine.  It is geared low, and but is quite smooth.  Being a 5 speed automatic it does down shift alot but comes with an overdrive switch.  I recieve about 16 mpg on avg.  The engine noise is not intrusive and Ford added alot of extra insulation to keep out noise in the 2001 model.  They also improved the handling and braking. Abs is now standard! This truck does excellent off road, the ground clearance for the off rd pkg is one of the best in its class.  The 4wd on demand is a great feature and works very smoothly.  The interior has not changed much, the seats received a better contour and more space compartments were added in 98.  My truck did come with some minor defects: 1 scratch, rear pass. dr not catching firmly at top, and some small stone chips in windshield.  The door will have to be fixed but the rest really is minor and I'll have to deal with it.  Ford gives you alot for your money, the same equipped toyota, s 10, nissan, would have been about 3k more.  I almost bought a new 2001 nissan but they were about 2k more.  Complaint:  The rear seats should have been redesigned to match the toyota tacoma (and to be able to handle a booster seat.)  Ford needs to improve the 3.0 liter---put a 3.3L dohc 24v 200hpr.  
Ford did well with the face lift. The new look and re-shaped hood is a nice feature.  Ford looks to do a complete remodel in 2003 with a wider platform.  (most likely a complete 4 dr). I would rate this truck a B+ in its class***  I would suggest the 4.0 l that was added this yr! ***Read follow up comments!! Alittle more Info or clarification**** Post a questions and I will Respond!! If I can help before you buy, let me know!<br><br>
