            Toyota has made the best cars that I have ever driven.  And the 4 Runner is absolutely the best car that I have ever owned.  It is good for many reasons.  For one, everything is easy access, you dont have to run you fingers all over the car to find the blinker or stuff like that.  Also, on my keychain, it has the lock and unlock feature, and it also has the rear window button so yo can roll down the window. It has saved me a lot of time.  Also, it is much more spacious, it has plenty, of foot room on the passenger and driver side.  And when I am driving on the highway, it seems so comfortable as I am driving on the main roads.   It is just an all around good car, and I love it.<br><br>
