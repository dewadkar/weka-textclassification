            I have purchased a Z28 camaro back in 1998.  I purchased the car after doing research on the powerful engine of the Z28.  The 346 inch cubic inch engine is the same engine that is found in the Corvette.  The Z28 camaro comes race ready from the showroom floor.  Capable of a quarter mile in the 13s, this car is truly a good value.  The newly designed LS1 produces 305 horse power and 335 lbs of torque.  The car is also capable of 0-60 in 5.2 seconds without modifications.  Just compare the Z28 to the Mustang Cobra.  The Cobra has a base price of $27,605.  It has a 4.6L V8 engine that produces 320 horse power, and 317 pounds of torque.  Base price on a Z28 is $21,515 which in my opinion has an engine with far more potential, and a better design.  
	The Z28 is a very fun car to drive.  I have purchased the 6 speed manual transmission.  The car has the power to put you back in the seat.  I like being able to take it up to 45 mph in 1st gear, then shift it in to second and have the tires spin.  The Z28 is a muscle car, it is not for everybody, but for those who like power, the Z28 is the way to go.  Iï¿½ve never had any problems with my Z28.
