            I bought my 1999 Golf "used" from the dealer in 2001, certified pre-owned, with just over 5,000 miles on it even though it was 2 years old.  It's got automatic transmission, sun/moon roof, power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, cruise control, and AM/FM/cassette stereo. (My husband added an aftermarket 8-CD changer that connects directly to the factory stereo.)

It's October 2003 and my Golf just passed its 30,000 mile mark. It's been relatively smooth sailing, driving and  maintenance-wise. I love to drive this car! I love that it has 4 doors. It's small and has a smooth ride. The "fit and finish" of the interior styling are way above average for this price of car. It could be a <i>little</i> peppier with pedal-to-the-metal acceleration, but it's the basic engine and an automatic transmission, so I feel I got what I paid for.

The car did have a problem with its original factory battery: namely, it died a year after I bought it, a little prematurely I thought.... and when the car wouldn't start, I called VW Roadside Assistance (it was still under that warranty at that time), however they didn't have the record of me being the car's new owner! So VW Roadside Assistance had to call the dealer where I bought it, & thank goodness the dealer was still open and could confirm - I would've been one unhappy camper if it'd been 2 a.m. on some dark highway with no way to confirm that, and I wasn't on AAA at the time because Roadside Assistance was supposed to take care of all that.

Both running lights died within a couple months of each other.... these were easily and inexpensively replaced at the auto parts store.

The check-engine light intermittently comes on, then decides to go off a few days later. I haven't looked into this fully yet but the dealer doesn't seem too worried about it.

Like many others, I dislike the drink-holder.

The bucket seats are not the most comfortable for long trips.

Basically I like this car a lot and would recommend it for others like me who just want a car to get them from A to B. Not for serious car-o-philes (unless you get the Turbo GTI!)
