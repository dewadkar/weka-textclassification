            I purchased a 1994 Acura Legend and absolutely love it.  It has great handling power, comfortable seating, and many accessories.  It has never given me any trouble whatsoever.  I believe that as long as you keep up with the required maintenance checks and oil changes, the care will last a long time.  

I have owned my Acura for the past six years and it has not been in for any service problems!  The quick response and easy driving has been a luxury all of it's own.  

The only problem that I see with the 1994 Acura, is that it did not come with a CD player.  It is good to buy a car that lasts a long time, but technology catches up too soon.  One can make the necessary luxury upgrades in accessories to the car.  

Another great factor about Acura, is the service quality that one will find at the dealership.  There are constant reminders and coupons sent to the home when the car is needing an updated check or maintenance.  

I believe that a quality care and quality service are on my list when purchasing a new car.  Check out Acura, you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
