            After driving a 1990 Sentra (no problems for 11 yrs whatsoever) I was ready to purchase a new car. As an early sign of a mid-life crisis, I almost ended up buying a Mustang GT. But fortunately, I came to my senses in time and bought a loaded 01 Sentra SE based on my past experience with my adored 1990 Sentra and thorough research.

I picked up my inferno color SE with perf. package about 2 weeks ago, and so far it surpassed my expectations. This car is a blast. Love it inside and out. The instrument panel is very precise and user friendly, love the titanium tinted gauges, beautiful stereo with 7 speakers and 6 disc CD changer, awesome power sunroof, and the list goes on. Mine also has the side air bags/ABS option (it's a must if you opt for the SE, by the way buying the SE with the performance package is a must as well, you'll spend a couple of grand more but believe me it is worth every penny!). Handling is fantastic, it really feels like a "mini Maxima" as this car is referred to on many automotive websites (Edmunds.com for instance rated this car #1 in the economy category, according to Edmund's evaluation the SE's final score surpassed that of the Focus, Protege, Corolla and Civic by a huge margin).

All in all this car offers a lot of affordable driving fun, and if in the long term it proves to be as reliable as my old Sentra I'll be one happy driver in this "compact" beauty.
