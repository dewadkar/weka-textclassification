            The 626 Lx with all the standard features and the optional alloy wheels was my family's  car of choice.  Some of those standard features include AM/FM cassette with CD player, AC, Power Windows/Doors, and remote locking system.  The four door sedan with 4 cylinder automatic transmission really does get 28 miles to the gallon in all around driving.  Five passenger seating with dual front air bags makes this the complete family car.  Our family has throughly enjoyed this car for the first few months that we have had it.  It is big enough to pack up for the weekend trip up skiing but small enough so it doesn't feel like you are driving a boat.  The only complaint that we have had thus far is with the amount of power that the 4 cylindar gets. It doesn't have too much get up and go.  I can not comment on how well it holds up because we haven't had the car for too long but so far nothing has gone wrong.  Overall this is a good by for those people looking for a nice car for not a lot of bucks<br><br>
