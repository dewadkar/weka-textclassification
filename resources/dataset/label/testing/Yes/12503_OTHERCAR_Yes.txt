            Was talked into leasing rather than buying a 1998 Continental, had never leased before, this was our tenth new Lincoln.  They took our 1994 Continental &amp; we paid $2000 at delivery &amp; drove the 1998 for 24 months, had to be very careful of the miles we were putting on the odometer as we were allowed 24000 miles, then, it was 15 cents per mile for miles over the limit, for this reason the car was parked for about 3 months this summer, we were not used to being careful about the amount of miles we drove each year, then came the day of reckoning, we had to decide to buy the car or turn it in &amp; walk away, we decided to turn it in to the dealer where we leased it, we called for an appointment, told the salesman we were turning it back to them the next day, when we arrived at the dealer, we were treated very rude by the salesman &amp; the leasing manager, like we had committed a cardinal sin.                                             
We leased the Lincoln because we had always had great service in the past &amp; the 1998 gave great service, it rode very good, the gas mileage was great for a car weighing 3800 pounds, the trunk was very large &amp; handled all our luggage when traveling, the front seats were somewhat uncomfortable on long trips. We liked the fact that it had lots of chrome &amp; got lots of attention. If we had purchased the car, rather than leasing it would have only been worth 50% of the purchase price in 24 months, but, had we bought it at the end of the lease, they were charging us 64%. Would recommend this car to someone that wanted to BUY a car to keep for 6 or 7 years, but, to trade in 2 or 3 years the depreciation is too  stiff. <br><br>
