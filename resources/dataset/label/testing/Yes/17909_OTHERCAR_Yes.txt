            We recently purchased our second Mercury vehicle.  In the Mountaineer we found all the comforts that we were looking for.  Our concern was safety since we were buying it for main transportation of our growing family.  Expecting our second child we needed more room than our compact car had.  We knew that we wanted an suv but left it open as to which one that we wanted.  We drove several other models including an Explorer, Rodeo, and Passport.  But as soon as we drove the Mountaineer we knew that was the car for us.  It had the luxury of a car and the utility of a small truck.  The value that we got was far better than any of the other cars that we had looked at.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with or without a family.  But it is a great Mommy Car.<br><br>
