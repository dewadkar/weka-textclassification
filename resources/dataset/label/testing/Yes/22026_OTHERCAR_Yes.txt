            Grand Prix's are durable, tough and comfortable.  This car is a definite must have.  Here are a few reasons why.

I received my Grand Prix the year I graduated from high school.  It lasted all through college, the first few years of marriage and now with a new child.  The durability of the Grand Prix is excellent.  For example, I had two wrecks within a year and half of purchasing my car.  The car was repaired by an excellent auto body shop and is still going seven years now.

The Grand Prix has over 120,000 miles on it and has not had to have a new battery.  The only things that have been replaced (with exception to my wrecks) are the alternator and brakes.  The car has been low maintenance and gives excellent gas mileage, even at this high mileage.  

The seats have surround features plus all of the basics (ex. cruise control).  The interiors are roomy and can accommodate both large and small features (whether height or size).  

The cars can be purchased at low and reasonable amount.  Most dealers will bargain with you somewhat, especially at year-end close-outs.  Plus,  they were having a special rate on purchases (I'm not sure about now.).

This car is a definite must see and hopefully, you will enjoy your's just as much.<br><br>
