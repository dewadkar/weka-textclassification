              After doing a lot of searching on the 'net and looking at what some of my friends were using the Olympus was definitely the way to go!  My only complaints are the smallish memory card that is provided, and the fact that the lens cap provides a problem if you forget to take it off before turning it on.

  I looked at the Nikon 885 and 995 as well as the Canon S30 and S40.  Definitely go to Circuit City or Best Buy to play with these cameras.  I chose the Olympus when you consider the Nikon will shoot QuickTime movies but without sound, the Canon will shoot movies with sound.  The Canon's port cover seemed very flimsy (I'd probably break in under a month).  Probably the other leg up Nikon and Canon had was the use of Compact Flash (more durable) vice Smart Media card.  But if you're banging your camera around I think you'll have other issues before the memory durability becomes a problem.  As far as image quality goes I'm sure they are all in about the same league so the cosmetics were the key for me.

  Also liked the ability to use add on lenses (no go for the Canon).  Software looks like it will be very good.  I especially like the fact that the Macintosh software isn't some stripped down 3 year old version.  Image transfer was flawless once I downloaded the USB Mass Storage drive 1.3.5 from Apple.  The was also pointed out in the manual, very comprehensive!

  The only nitpicky thing I saw was the fact that you need the Olympus cards to shoot panoramic photos...no third party cards!

  The photos that I've taken are sharp and clear.  And of course if you don't like the shot, delete it!  I had the camera out of the box and was shooting photos in under 5 minutes.  The fast lens and quick cycle times are great when you've got children who rarely wait for the camera to cycle.

  <b>Bottom line:</b>  This is a great camera especially for the price that I paid!  I recommend it to anyone with our reservation.
