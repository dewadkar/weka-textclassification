            We bought a 97 sunfire that had only dealer miles. ( 700 ). we were very excited about this car. we had not purchased a new one in many years.
We purchased this from Plaza Motors in Palm Springs CA. The back seat pull down loop was off.To date it has not be replaced after taking to dealer 3 times. We started off with a $14,999 sticker and ended up paying 3 times more. We put $3000.00 down which should have brought price down. we signed a contract only to have them 3 weeks later demand an additional $500 or they would pick car up and keep the $3000 as rental and mileage used fees.
We called the police and were informed that dealerships can and do this to make more money. The items on the car were never fixed despite taking it in 3 times. This has been a nightmare.  We had problems with a dealership using Mafia type actions. This whole deal has turned into a costly nightmare and my health was ruined. We wrote to GM they apparently they don't care how or who sells there product.
