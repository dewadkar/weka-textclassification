            Having owned a prior digital camera that just wouldn't do the job, I was pleasantly surprised when the DC280 arrived and did all I could ever ask.  My sight is not as good as it once was, so I needed a good quality camera that would focus itself clearly, and take a fine picture that I could post on my site for use by online auctions.

I find I can take pictures down to about 8 inches away from the subject and they are clear as can be.  The camera automatically cuts the light of the flash at that range so it is not overpowering.  Such close-up ability, coupled with a zoom lens makes this camera great for all around photography.

The one thing I don't like about the camera is that it is a little tough on batteries.  However, a charger comes with it and the batteries may be recharged up to 50 times.  To save on battery use, I have purchased a USB card reader, making the job of transfer of pictures to my hard drive easier and faster.  One can also purchase an attachment to allow use of electrical power.<br><br>
