            I just recently purchased a 1999 chevy cavalier and I am very happy with my purchase.  It was a spare of the moment kind of purchase.  I have been wanting a newer car, but just didn't think I could afford it.  One weekend I decided to go looking, with not even intending to buy.  When I found out how little the payments were going to be for such a new car, it was just too good to pass up.  The payments were low enough that I realized that I could actually afford this newer vehicle that I wouldn't have even dreamed about before.  Not only is it cute and compact, but it drives beautifully.  I owned an older cavalier in the past and had hardly any problems, except for the basics that you would find with any car.  I'm confident I will be driving this car for many happy years.  This is definately a purchase I recommend for those college students or for those who just don't have much money to spend, but want something nice to drive.  Cavaliers are affordable and dependable, most anyone can fit the payments into their budget, so why not start today by taking a look at one?  <br><br>
