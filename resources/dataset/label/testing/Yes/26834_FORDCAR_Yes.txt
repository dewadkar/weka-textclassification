                 After owning and driving numerous cars, trucks and SUVs, I decided it was time to settle down and buy a vehicle that I loved, and would also accommodate my family needs as well as functional needs.  After much thought, test drives, and speaking with owners of full size SUV's, my wife and I decided a Ford Expedition was what best suited our lifestyle.  We had a 1996 Nissan Pathfinder and it just wasn't big enough for our trips.  When you have three large dogs (two Rotties and an Akita), plus a wife that packs enough to survive for the next millennium without having to do laundry once, you learn that a mid-size SUV just doesn't cut it.  So the Expedition it was.

     After shopping around for both new and used Expeditions, we settled on getting a 1999 model with 4WD.  I lived in the snow for too long to want to deal with chains and/or snow tires.  The price was right and the trim package better.  I think the only thing that prevented this particular vehicle from being the Eddie Bauer model is that the seats are not heated, the engine is the 4.6, and there is no VCR/DVD system installed.

     The ride quality of this vehicle is exceptional.  I have yet to be in another SUV where the ride is so smooth.  The soft leather allows for my wife to easily sleep while I drive to Orlando (500 mi. away from where we live), and she doesn't really stir at all.  With the 3rs seat removed, all three dogs have plenty of room to lay down and sleep without laying on each other.  And we can fit everything we need (and a lot of things we don't) in the second row.

    The mechanical condition of this vehicle was the best yet.  Our family mechanic took it apart from top to bottom and the only thing he suggested was to change all the fluids, and get new tires.  But I figured on that since the car had about 77,000 miles on it.  Other then those two things he said that the mechanics were immaculate.

     Now after having the vehicle for about a month and a half, I can tell you that overall it is a very smooth and quiet ride.  I have to turn down the radio completely and roll down the windows to really hear the engine and the tires.  Basically what I am saying is that the sound of the engine and the sound of the tires on the raod are virtually non-existant.  This is really amazing considering the size of the vehicle.

     The feeling of this vehicle is very stable.  In comparing it to my parents 93 Isuzu Rodeo, as well as my Pathfinder, there is almost no comparison.  I can take turns at 10 mph faster than I could in the Pathfinder and still feel little to no pull.  I am thrilled with that aspect of the full size SUV.

     The Expedition also has a smooth gear shift.  There is little to no jump in the switching of gears.  My boss that owns a 2003 Tahoe can't even say that.  If you weren't paying attention to the tachometer you wouldn't even know the gears were changing.

     The only negative to owning a car like this is the gas mileage, but if you do your research you will know this before hand.  The other issue is the room with the 3rd seat in.  Basically there is none.  Small children are fine back there, but don't plan on buying too much.  Again, I did my research and already knew that.  Other than that there is nothing I can say bad about the vehicle.  Even used this SUV is phenomenal. 

     I would suggest anyone thinking about buying an Expedition to ask owners of the vehicle what they think about it.  That is how you will get the most honest feedback you can.  After all, they are the ones driving it day in and day out.
