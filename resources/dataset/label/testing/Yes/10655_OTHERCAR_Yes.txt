            I was one of those kids in the 70's that grew up with a van.  These days, vans are nothing like their box shaped counterparts of the past.  The Grand Voyager is definitely a great vehicle without the bus driver feel. My wife and I decided on the Grand Voyager for many reasons.  
In this SUV crazy world, you can get much more vehicle by going with a minivan.  You get more room, ease of getting passengers (kids)in the vehicle, without compromising style, amenities, and smooth ride.  The Grand Voyager has two rear sliding doors.  Once you own one, you will wonder why they still make minivans with only one side door. Often times when you purchase the &quot;Grand&quot; model of vehicle, you are forced into amenities you don't necessarily need.  With the Grand Voyager, you can scale it up, or take just the basics.
The ride of the Grand Voyager is comparable to any vehicle.  It is easy to drive with a regular car feel. My wife was concerned when we first talked of buying a van. All of her worries were quickly removed with the first test drive. She feels as comfortable as she did with the small vehicles she used to drive.
The minivan used to have a &quot;soccer mom&quot; or &quot;mall dweller&quot; stigma. The Grand Voyager is not a cookie cutter vehicle for car pool drivers.  It is a smart choice for someone wanting comfort, style, and value.   <br><br>
