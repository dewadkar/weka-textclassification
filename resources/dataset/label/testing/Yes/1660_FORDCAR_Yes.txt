            The Excursion, despite the critical reviews is a great vehicle.  I grant you that it is not for everyone, but neither is a hi-top conversion van, an F350 dually diesel or a motorcycle for that matter.  Obviously Ford did their home work and came up with what a certain segment of the market wanted.  
I am the previous owner of a suburban which by most accounts is considered a big vehicle.  With a large family who likes to take weekend trips we could always use the room.  I personally have never liked a conversion van or any van for that matter because of the position of the seats in relation to the front end, the lack of doors for passengers on each side, and the boxy look.  The Excursion is long enough to have some proportion and is ideally suited for hauling kids and adults. 
It is built on the F250hd platform but with car like improvements in steering, ride and noise reduction. The Excursion 4x4 weighs approx. 6800lbs (7200 w/ diesel motor)and is actually just over 3&quot; wider and 7&quot; longer than the suburban, not actually as big as some people claim. I like to think of it as having the capacity of a full size van with the ruggedness and style of a suv. 
As far as the environment goes it actually uses around 20% of recycled materials and emits 43% less pollution than the government regulations require. This actually makes the Excursion one of the most environmentally friendly suv vehicles out there in terms of its usefulness. 
 It will also tow up to 10,000 pounds which makes a large travel trailer or boat possible and still allow for several passengers and cargo unlike a van or pickup.  The Excursion will also hold a 4x8 sheet of plywood (up to 35 sheets to be exact),the suburban won't, which is great for the do it your-selfer.  
It does use more gas than a Honda Accord, about 14mpg w/v-10 and a 3:73 rear-end. (Not as bad as everyone claimed) Also, the new Excursion has a blocker beam in the front and a large low mount hitch in the back (almost 4' across) that makes contact with the front and rear  bumpers on the average car and helps prevents the car from going under it in the event of an accident. 
Over 148,000 suburbans were made last year but Ford has limited production of the Excursion to only 25,000 this model year so don't expect to see one on every corner. As for price I paid $36,500 in 1998 for my 98 GMC Suburban SLT 4x4(list of $40,800.) and only $38,600. for my 2000 Ford Excursion Limited 4x4(list of $41,800.). The Limited comes standard with leather, power seats, cd/cassette stereo, Tow package, trip computer, wood grain trim, premium wheels and more. Virtually every option except limited slip, 6 disc cd changer, all terrain tire option, reverse sensing(park assist ), and htd seats. 
The biggest complaint that I have heard is from people who drive cars and either don't like ( which is fine ) or can't afford an suv, complaining about it blocking their view. That is a legitimate beef which is probably what helps perpetuate the growing number of suv's purchases. ( The complainers become suv owners) I travel a lot and I feel the Excursion is as safe as my S320 Mercedes. 
There are a few things that the Excursion does not offer that would have been nice.  such as...daytime driving lights, fog lights, automatic night sentry ( lights come on at night automatically and they also stay on a pre-determined amount of time when you turn off the vehicle at night), bucket seats in the middle row ( optional on new suburbans), sunroof, spare tire under the truck rather than in the back, and a better sounding stereo.
Lastly, if you have no need for one, don't buy one,but don't assume everyone has the same needs as yourself.  Look around, America is a very diverse nation with many different occupations and lifestyles.  We are not all suburbanites and soccer moms. Large suv's contribute over twice as much revenue through road taxes for every mile traveled as the average car.    I still live in America and I'm proud of our ability to exercise our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. God Bless America! Consider this.......<br><br>
