            I am an American soldier stationed in Bosnia and just before I was deployed I bought A new Plymouth Voyager for my wife sarah. My wife has been driving it in upstate NY for 6 months and she loves it. She has had no problems with it. I think this is a good family vehicle. We have two little boys and it is easy for them to get in and out. I like the way the seats are easy to remove. It is easy to put a car seat in. I have also found that with the back seats out it is very easy to put a very large load in it and I have hauled a washer and drier in it at the same time. I got the smallest engine but I would reccomend a little bigger engine if you plan to haul heavy loads. It is a little under powered on the highway<br><br>
