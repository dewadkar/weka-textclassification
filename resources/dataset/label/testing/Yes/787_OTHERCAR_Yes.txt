            Right when you think that there aren't anymore versatile vehicles on the road you look to chevy, and what do they have that no other car manufactorer has, they have the most versatile vehicle around. The chevy Astro Van is quite possibly the best van, truck, and car ever designed in one. It has the capibility of carrying a full sheet of plywood and much more lumber and keeping it dry, and you can carry things as large as a lawn mower or motorcycle in it and keep them out of the elements. And don't think that it doesn't have enough power to do this, it has enough power to tow a 22ft bow rider boat with a 90hp in board engine. And it tows it with ease. Even going up hills the van pulls the boat very easily. And when your not towing anything and your just traveling in the van the handling is very good. I mean it's not like a sports car or anything but the van drives better than you think it would for the size of it. Just think of it as a superb handling enclosed truck that can hold 8 people or any combination of people and cargo. We have had no major problems with the van except for a pinging sound in the rear of the van, but we brought it to the chevy dealer and they fixed it right up. The brakes are good and it has good acceleration even with a moderate amount of cargo. 

Don't buy the van expecting it to handle or accelerate like a BMW or Mercedes. Buy it knowing that you can move probably anything you want and that it handle and drives better than probably any minivan or van out on the road today. And if you buy the all-wheel drive model then you got a sport utility vehicle to.
