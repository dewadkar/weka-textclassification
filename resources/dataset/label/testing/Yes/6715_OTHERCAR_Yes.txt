            I bought my 92 Chevy Lumina Van 8/98.  It is white with red stripe.  When I bought it, it had 121,000 miles on it.  It still drove like a dream.  I have since put 12,000 miles on it, and gave it a complete tune up.  It runs better now than the day I bought it.  I only paid 5995.00 for it.  I have paid it off.  I have made long trips in it.  It has enough room for my four kids.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Well maybe a 99 Dodge Durango.  I has only given me a few problems.  The altenator went out on it.  Before the tune up, it was losing MPH on gas.  But I would recomend this van to anyone who has a family, or needs a nice riding vehicle to drive.  This Van is a must for a large family like mine.
    The main reason I bought this van is because of the size of my family.  I did test drive other vans and suburbans.  The other vans that I drove didn't have the leg room that this does, and Were not as clean as this one.  Most vans that I drove or looked at had more miles on them than mine does.  I started out looking for something under 100,000 mile but that was out of the question with what I had to spend.  Vans are expensive if you want a good one. <br><br>
