            I've had my Sedona EX for 6 months and 8000 miles. So far it has been a good experience with a few minor niggles. 

<b>Buying</b>
When we began our shopping marathon in September there were no Sedonas available in Michigan. It was November until the dealer was able to find an EX with any of the 4 color choices we asked for. The dealer was very good about it and made us a pretty good deal since we purchased another new Kia (Rio Cinco) at the same time.

<b>Interior</b>
We have two large dogs and that was our primary motivation in buying a van. The Sedona is a handy size for our purposes. We seldom have all of the seats installed. The dash has some cryptic controls (it took me a while to figure our how to operate the rear interior lights without reading the manual) and I find it amazing that the passenger does not have a central power lock switch. If anyone knows Korea, is this a cost saving issue or some strange social statement?

I'm a big guy (six foot and 280) and I like the driver's seat. The overall quality of materials seems good and the stereo and overall trim level is good. I like the overhead console for my sunglasses. 

We have placed carpet remnants on the floor to cover the seat mounting holes and have ordered some seat covers to deflect the dog hair. The EX velour seats seem to be as good as velcro for capturing dog hair. The rear A/C is good for the dogs. It could use some tie down hooks or other attachments for those times we have a lot of luggage and the dogs. 

<b>Exterior</b>
I think that the Sedona is as attractive as almost any minivan, although I do think that the Town and Country has a pretty front 3/4 view. There should be a power antenna, although the car wash has not trashed the standard fiberglass rod. The large headlights throw out a lot of light, unlike the mid 90's Chrysler products that leave leave you feeling like Mr. Magoo on a dark night. Our Sedona is solid white without the two-tone. That large a surface just cried out for a tape stripe. It looked like an unrented billboard. With a medium sized tape graphic the Sedona looks much better. I think that the chrome grill and trim add to the overall attractiveness of this vehicle.

<b>Performance</b>
We've recently returned from a Michigan to Tennessee vacation with dogs, luggage and all of the accoutrements of vacationing Americans and were very pleased with the way the Sedona behaved. We saw two tanks of 22+ MPG and one of 24+. This was primarily interstate highway miles, fully loaded with the Cruise Control set at about 73 MPH. This mileage surprised me since the city mileage is mediocre, about 17 MPH most of the time. 

I believe that the low mileage is due to the high weight of the Sedona's structure. It looks like then Kia engineers decided to save money by utilizing cheaper steels, in larger pieces, rather than the more expensive, high strength steel. If an inch is good then two inches is better.

Acceleration is good, it's no Porsche but it is certainly adequate. Handling is as good as I expect from a minivan. Any better cornering and the dogs would throw up.

<b>Reliability</b>
We've only had one problem worth noticing so far. The remote door lock controller began to work intermittantly and was replaced without any whining by the dealer. 

<b>Overall</b>
I suspect that the Honda and the Chryslers are better vehicles than the Sedona but I am not convinced that they are worth that much more money. If you intend to keep your minivan until it is completely used up the Sedona is probably your best value.
