            I bought a Cavalier (RS, RED) just last September, and I LOVE IT.  It is a decent looking car, and is quite reliable. The reason I bought a Cavalier is because my boyfriend has one. It has high mileage, and the way he treats his cars, he's lucky he's had it so long ( its 14 years old). My Cavalier is not a new one, but its a 91.  A few of my friend's own new ones, and LOVE IT.  They are quite inexpensive (c'mon, 12K for a BRAND NEW car with a TON of features is NOT bad at all). I hear the 97's have a bit of trouble with the electronics inside, but thats the only bad thing I've heard about them. Since September, I drive &quot;my baby&quot; to school and back, and it has not let me down yet.  Yes, I had to replace an alternator , but  thats the only thing.  Its sporty, trendy, and looks great! The only advice I would give is that you take care of them! They CAN rust if you dont wash it every few weeks or so...and give it oil changes every 3K miles or 3 months . I get about 27 MPG on the car... <br><br>
