            I recently picked up a new 2003 Audi A6 Quattro equipped with the 2.7 Bi-Turbo motor and a 5 speed Tiptronic transmission.  The car comes standard with sport suspension and a 17" wheel and tire package for 2003.  I upgraded to the Premium Package (which includes sunroof, Xenon headlights, auto-dim mirrors), Cold Weather Package (heated front and rear seats), and the Bose 250 watt stereo.  I chose the Pirelli P6 all season tires rather than the high performance summer tires.

For the last four years my family car has been a BMW 528i which I consider to be the finest sport/luxury sedan I've ever owned.  Having test driven a 2002 A6, I was prepared to take a step down in order to get AWD in a mid-sized sedan configuration.  The 2002 A6 I test drove was somewhat louder than the 528i and a lot less precise in its steering and handling.  I am surprised at how much better the 2003 with the sport suspension feels.  The car is actually quieter than the BMW up to about 60 mph and its handling is very close to the handling I am used to.  The steering is heavier and not as precise, but it seems much less "overboosted" than the 2002 I drove and is actually quite good. 

The interior of this car is exceptionally well executed, spacious, and has many storage compartments available to make up for the rather small glove box.  My minor complaints are:  the recessed headlight rotary switch is difficult to use with gloves, and the adjustable armrest partially blocks the hand brake.  I also feel that the brake pedal is a bit too close to the throttle for my size 12 right foot.  Also, the driver's seat rubbed against the center console and made a squeaking noise.  I treated the sides of the seats with mink oil and took care of that quickly.  Everything else on this car is very well thought out and intuitive.  There's even a pair of pull down hooks in the trunk that accommodate plastic grocery bags. 

The Bose stereo system is a full and rich sounding system that is connected to a head unit that actually is easy to use.  The Bose does not have lots of "punch" in the treble or mid-range frequencies, but still manages to provide a pleasing and well balanced sound.  An in-dash 6 CD changer is standard and sure beats going to the trunk to change a CD.

Traction in snow is why I bought this car and I have, so far, driven in snow, ice, and slush almost daily.  The P6 tires have done well although I can induce the ABS to engage on hard stops.  I have also, on snow and/or slush, been able to break the P6 tires loose on hard starts.  I'm sure they'll be fine for winter use but I  installed a set of Blizzak LM-22 winter tires just to be on the safe side.  The combination of the LM-22 tires and Quattro provide tremendous traction in awful driving conditions.  I have easily gotten through heavy snow and/or ice on roads and driveways that would have left my BMW spinning its tires in frustration.

Acceleration with the 2.7T is impressive...much better than I would expect in a 4,000 pound all wheel drive car.  (The factory claims 0-60 times of 6.6 seconds with the automatic, 6.0 seconds with the 6 speed manual).  Gas mileage is not nearly as good as the 528i was....about 18.5 mpg in local mixed driving, and up to 24.9 on mostly highway driving.  

Build quality on this car is superb...fit and finish and paint quality just could not be any better.  My A6 lacks a few amenities that I like...power tilt and telescoping wheel (it's manual), and no cruise or audio controls on the three spoke sport steering wheel that comes standard with the 2.7T.

Overall, I am very impressed with this car.  It is very quiet (absolutely no wind noise up to 60 mph and little road/tire noise), has a tight yet compliant sport suspension, is very fast, and is a pleasure to drive.  Although the seats could use more lateral support, both my 5'2" wife and my 6'3" self easily find comfortable driving positions in this car.  Although the Audi does not feel quite as agile as my old BMW 528i, it is, in my opinion, the best of the AWD sedans available in the luxury/sport segment of the market. This car is a class act.
