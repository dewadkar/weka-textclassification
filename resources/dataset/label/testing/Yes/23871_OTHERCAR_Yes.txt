            Being the age that I am, in my Early 20's, most car salesmen thought I was crazy when I told them I wanted to buy a Buick.  Especially when they noticed that I was driving a 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Bottom line is that I wanted a car that was going to be reliable, at a fair price, and that had trunk room to fit a small army in.

When I started my search for a new car, I needed to lower my payments from my Eclipse, I called around to friends and family asking what they recommended.  My uncle had just bought a New 2000 Regal.  He told me to go see his friend at the Buick Dealership and see what he could do for me.  (Isn't it funny how guys think that car dealers are their friends after they complete a good fair deal with them.....)  Upon arriving I fell in love with a used Buick Century Limited.  It was a 1998, with low miles that an elderly couple had traded in.  Even had the FULL service record with it.  I decided to take the test drive, and I was pretty well sold.  

One of the things that this vehicle has that I feel make it a great buy is the room.  I can easily fit 4 or 5 adults into it with no problem.  It definitely has that trunk space I was talking about above.  A small army is no problem.  Now remember I am coming from a 2000 Eclipse, so to you it may be a large or medium trunk, but to me Moses himself had parted the Red Sea in the back of this car. I thought, and still feel, that the trunk space is great.

Another thing was the ride...... Ohhhhhhh the ride.  Now this was no sports car, I was used to the 200+ Horse Power Eclipse, but the 160, or 170 I cant remember off the top of my head, horse power Buick definitely held its own. It has nice passing power, and off the line kick if you need it. I also noticed that the car just seems to glide across the road.  ALMOST like it is floating on air.  I REALLY LOVE the ride.

The engine, as stated above, produces between 160 and 170 horse.  I do have to say it is the quietest I have EVER heard.  In fact one of the salesmen were telling me that some fancy magazine did a write up and said that only a Lexus was quieter.  I have never driven a Lexus, but this is a real quiet car.

I had heard that some people thought the seats were not very comfortable in this particular car, but I have to disagree.  Now I do have the Leather seats, and the longest ride I have been on would be between 3 or 4 hours, but I felt quite comfortable.  (I actually have a lower back problem from an injury, and I feel VERY comfortable in this car)

The dual climate control is GREAT.  I like to have things a little cooler then others, and my Century has an option for the passenger to set their temp a little warmer or cooler then I have it set.

A few other key features include : Dual power seats (I love those), Power Rearview mirrors on the doors, and an auto dimming rear view mirror for the main center mirror inside.  This  may be one of the things I like the most.  It dims by itself so the headlights of higher sitting SUV's or Trucks, or cars for that matter, behind you dont hurt your eyes.

So far I have had no trouble out of this car, besides the tape player ate a tape.  The dealership removed the tape and got me a NEW Stereo.  I have already put 10,000 + miles on this car in a little less then 6 months, and it has been all trouble free.

Well, I think that about covers it.  I want to thank you for reading my review.  If you are in the market for a larger family car, with a little bit of luxury, and you dont want to pay $25,000 +, this car is definitely one worth considering.
