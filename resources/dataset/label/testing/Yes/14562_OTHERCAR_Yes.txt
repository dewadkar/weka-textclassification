            Shot an eagle with my new Sony digital camera, I mean! Then it was just a matter of taking a disk out of the camera and putting it in my computer and I was sending photos to my friends and family.
After doing a lot of research on the internet, this Sony Mavica was the one I put on my list for Santa, since it sells for a reasonable price and has all the features you need to make great photos.
When I opened THAT gift first, I was able to capture all the rest of the Holiday fun and folks, to share with those far away.
Along with many easy-to-use features, the photos I took with this great camera were clear and bright. I'm sure even a novice will be happy with this camera...another product of Sony that fulfills all the promises!<br><br>
