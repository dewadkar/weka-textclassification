            This is simply one of the best cameras I've seen as far as value is concerned.  Frankly, I've worked with other newer cameras and I keep coming back to the MVC-FD73.  Its ability to take digital stills instantly, and quickly write to and access the floppy disk make it considerably useful on the go.

Unlike some other more &quot;advanced&quot; methods of transfer, the floppy disk is compatible with practically every pc out there, and therefore you can easily take your pictures with you anywhere.

The zoom feature on this particular camera is exceptionally good as well.

Now nothing's perfect - there are a few downsides to everything, and this is no exception.  However the downsides are few and bearable.  First of all, despite praises in picture quality for the price, the resolution on the MVC-FD73 is only 640x480.  This coupled with its size provide adequate annoyance to the short tempered photographer.

All in all however, i think that this camera is an excellent choice based on its features and its relatively low cost.<br><br>
