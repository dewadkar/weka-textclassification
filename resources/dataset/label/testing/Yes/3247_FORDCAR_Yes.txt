            My uncle owns a construction business. He has many trucks and one of them is a 1995 Ford F250 XLT. This truck is the most dependable truck that he has ever owned. It has 240,000 plus miles on it and it still runs great. It has had some trouble with the transmission. This truck runs better then some of his newer trucks. Everyday this truck takes abuse. The truck is mainly used for towing and hauling things in the bed. I personally have filled the entire bed with bricks and the bed was sagging and there was still plenty of towing power. This truck is basically unstoppable I would recommend this truck to anyone who has to do heavy duty work or even to anyone that just needs an everyday truck. I would not recommend this truck to people who would have to drive long distances because this truck is bad on gas. The truck rides really rough but what truck doesn't. This is a great truck.<br><br>
