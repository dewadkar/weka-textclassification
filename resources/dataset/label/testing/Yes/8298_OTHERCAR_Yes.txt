            The first time I saw the 2003 Toyota Corolla was on a parking lot at school, at first glance the Corolla S captivated me &#150 that I seriously considered the car for my first vehicle purchase.  While the exterior design is not as extrinsic as the Beatle or the Cruiser, it certainly was unique enough from cars of the same class to satisfy my desire to standout but yet remain conservative.  

There were many factors to why I decided to purchase the Corolla.  One it had to be within my budget; two it had to be to fuel efficient; with gas prices in Hawaii being so high, I couldn&#146t possibly afford an SUV.  In comparison with the Prius, Honda Civic (including the Hybrid), and Ford&#146s Escape, Corolla topped my list.

This years Corolla is completely redesigned, it&#146s wider, taller, longer, and trendier --which Toyota hopes will attract younger drivers.  As a 20 years old college student the new Corolla certainly attracted me, I guess it worked.  But beside appearance, Toyota boosted the power of the Corolla from previous models, now comprising an All-aluminum 1.8-liter DOHC 16-valve VVT-i 4-cylinder130 hp @ 6,000 rpm125 lb.-ft. @ 4,200 rpm &#150 a minor improvement.  But to tell you the truth I could care less about horse powers and what not.  What really attracted me to the car is its excellent fuel efficiency, design, and relatively affordable price.  While not as efficient as a hybrid car, combined with its lower price, and overall better interior and exterior designed of the Corolla, it ended up topping my list.  

With a 32/40 fuel efficiency for manual and 30/39 for automatic, I figured I could save a few hundred dollars at the pump.  However, I was a little disappointed, when my Corolla&#146s fuel efficiency only averaged 29 miles per gallon on 1/3 street and 2/3 highway driving, I tried to maintain a fuel efficient driving habit, and make sure my tire pressure are correct, despite all my efforts&#133 still no improvements.  In spite of the poorer fuel efficiency result, results were still satisfactory &#150 it certainly is better then my sister&#146s 24 mpg Nissan.

Another disappointment I had with the car was the optional, RS3200 Plus Security System.  This is my first car, so I have little experience with anything dealing with vehicles; I had assumed that all car alarms are the same but the RS3200 proved me wrong.  I had assumed that all car alarms were sensitive, even to the bump of a basketball, and that all alarms made a &#147chirp&#148 or &#147buzz&#148 sound every time the lock or unlock button is pressed.  If you&#146re a person who likes a sensitive alarm and want the convinces of hearing a &#147chirping or buzzing&#148 sound of an alarm locking, don&#146t purchase the RS3200, it doesn&#146t boast of those features.  If those things irritate you, the RS3200 is perfect for you.  But coming from a neighborhood where a car of ours was stolen from our garage in daylight, having a sensitive alarm, and the assurance of a chirp locking your lock, these features are essential to you.  If you want to have these types of features, buy your alarm elsewhere.  A great aftermarket alarm system sales for the same or even less the price of the RS3200 ($300).

Another problem I have, although it is a small one, is the placement of the Emergency button.  The emergency button is simply placed too closely to the air conditioner button.  For the first few weeks I constantly mistakenly pressed one for the other.  However, this problem has been reduced as I got more familiar with the buttons.

These are the few cons of the Corolla I found, but overall the good things about this car outweighs the cons, however, I'd be nice if Toyota offered a better warranty.  I have been receiving great compliments on the car. Even though, I would rather have a BMW, I still feel GREAT driving this car.
