            In short, it's a great car!  Under the body the Prizm is actually a Toyota Corolla.  Once I found this out and realized that the Corolla is a couple thousand dollars more, I was impressed.  However, I researched similar cars for about three weeks before I bought the Prizm.  No other car compared regarding the quality you get for the price.

I've owned it for about five months and haven't had any significant problems with it.  My sister-in-law has almost the exact same car and we've noticed some common problems with both cars.  The dash vents tend to become loose and won't hold their position.  Also, the domelight and shift indicator light (the one that tells you if you're in drive, reverse, etc.) were burned out on both cars.

The car handles very well, has dual-side airbags, feels solid, and the LSi has a nice peppy engine.  Trust me, if you buy a Toyota, Honda, etc. you're paying for the name and reputation.  Get the same car, but for less money.<br><br>
