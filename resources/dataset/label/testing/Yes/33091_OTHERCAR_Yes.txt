<TEXT>
            The 1984 Alfa Romeo spider was my first car, and was owned by me for 13 years before she was killed by arson. It broke my heart. I'm now in search of another spider. If they were poor cars, I would not have owned it for so many years, nor would I be trying to find another. 

One should only own one if one plans to change it's oil EVERY 3,000 miles, and bring it in for regular check ups. Perhaps three times a year. Also, I would never own one if you think this is going to be like owning a HONDA. It will need a KNOWLEDGEABLE mechanic. If you do, and have regular check ups, you will have an EXTREMELY RELIABLE automobile! It's reliability, and condition relies entirely by YOU, THE OWNER. Mine NEVER failed to get me to work in 13 years of ownership...could your car claim the same? If you neglect it, not only will it give you problems, you won't deserve to own such a special car. The verdict? Worth every penny!
