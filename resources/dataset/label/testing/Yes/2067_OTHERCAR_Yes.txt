            All I want is a cheap, easy to use point-and-click camera that'll fit nicely in my pocket, so I can take it wherever I want - and this pretty much fits the bill. I'm sure the purists will sneer, but what the hey. If you have to spend half an hour fumbling about with an enormous piece of kit that you can't use when you're drunk, there's no point, I reckon.

It is absurdly simple to use - point it at your victim, press the button and that's it. Remember to turn the flash on if it's dark though :-)

Picture quality is good, and prints out well in normal photo size. Don't try anything too big, though. Outdoors, pics come out well in all conditions - indoors, the flash range is limited so bear that in mind, otherwise the images will be dull and grainy.

Bung a compact flash card in the socket and you can take up to 92 pics at the highest resolution (16mb card) and something like 350 at the lowest, so storage is excellent. It won't work with anything over a 16mb card, though, so don't rush out and buy an enormously expensive 128mb card or you'll just have to take it back.

You do need very small, very strong fingers to take the card out again, however. That or some very carefully handled pliers.

The bad points - the USB cable cover is held on by a tiny, weak bit of plastic that broke on about the second day of use. I'll probably lose that soon :-(

Battery life is not good if you take a lot of pics with the flash - 30-40. More without, so perhaps buy some rechargeable batteries and take a spare pair out with you.

Otherwise, it's fab. And it records video and is an excellent webcam too.
