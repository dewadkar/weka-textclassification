            Originally thought to get the 2001 extended Venture LS as it had good features (alloy wheels, luggage rack, driver info center with trip computer and compass, CD radio etc.) but then I thought I'm going to be spending at least $25K anyway so might as well add a little more to get a really nice vehicle. We got our 2001 silver Warner Bros. Edition (our "Bugs Bunny Mobile") back in April as it was time to take advantage of GM's incentives, cash in on our GM Mastercard earnings and my wife's college grad. rebate before it expires soon. Who says it doesn't pay to get your BA at age 30? We made a visit to the dealer and the van went from their showroom floor to our garage the same day. I had looked at the Windstars and Caravans for comparison for features and pricing. Everyone knows the Odyssey and Sienna are probably more reliable and have higher resale but we have all heard stories about the arrogant Honda and Toyota sales people, plus not much in sales incentives and not willing to budge much on their MSRP's if any. Since I plan to keep this van forever fate permitting, as it's only meant for weekend and recreational use, resale value was not an issue.  What really sealed the deal was GMAC's 0.9&% APR financing over 48 months which is like nothing.  It's a no brainer to take this in lieu of the $1,500 rebate. My first choice was the Olds Silhouette as it looks the best of the 3 GM MV's, but the Olds doesn't offer 8 pass. seating or an integral child seat for our 20 m.o. son and the top line Preimere with the video system was way too much. Never really got around to looking at the Pontiac Montana though it offers these options as the Montana looks rugged but not as smooth.  The Chevy Venture WB Edition's video system is a big plus, our son loves to watch his Blues Clues videos while traveling. We've had the van for over 2 months with over 1,600 miles so far with no problems. Don't understand why Chevy didn't include a tachometer when Olds and Pontiac did so for their MV's, when you spend so much for a vehicle, you expect this as standard. Since my brother back east earlier had just gotten a Windstar SE with the leather seats,  family security pkg., side air bags, and video entertainment system for about $28,500, I figure $29,000 (orig. MSRP $31,305) not including our $2k in GM earnings and $1K grad rebate incentive deduction was reasonable. Another brother back east in NJ just bought a loaded Mazda MPV LX for under $23k. I found our silver WB Edition Venture thru GM's Buypower website and got an initial best price offering. Only after I was going to leave after having test driven and the dealer wasn't willing to budge on their 1st offer did they come down several hundred more to my top price. Probably could have gotten it for little more lower if I really tried and held my ground but what the heck, give the family run dealership a fair profit plus we already had other incentive discounts in our pocket already. Our van has no added options, only thing I would have added was traction control but since it rarely snows in the Seattle area and I'm not into skiing, it didn't really matter anyway.  GM's video system is the best as they offer the biggest video screen 6.8" with remote and 4 wireless dual channel headphones with individual volume controls,(Windstar's is only 6.4" comes with only 2 headphones and they are corded). After you get used to the power sliding rear door and rear parking aid, it's hard to do without.  The OnStar feature is nice to have but doubt we will renew after the 1st year's incldued safety & security service is up as it costs about $17 per  month afterwards, little less for longer terms.  Also the easy to fold-down 3rd seat with 3 compartment convenience storage feature is a plus.  The RDS smart radio with CD/tape is nice and packed with features but the 4 speakers are only average in sound (other MV's can have much more speakers), but not that you will get the chance to blast the tunes in a minivan anyway. A big plus is that for a MV the Venture has the best MPG of any of them, 19 city & 26 highway, even better than the smaller MV's with less HP like the Mazda MPV and Nissan Quest. In mixed driving we have been getting over 22 MPG. Our 2001 silver WB Edition Venture is loaded with many nice features, has a nice ride, smooth handling, and is easy to drive, overall we are very happy with our "Bunny Mobile".  Family trips will be more enjoyable for everyone in this van that is loaed with nice features.
