            Call it a brute beast, heavy, savage, and tough piece of machinery on the roads and the fields.  F-150 SuperCrew is truly the type of vehicles that construction foreman or a dairy farmer or any farmer raising cattle can enjoy.  More than all these purposes, it can easily meet the needs of an entire family for a quick trip to the beach or the fishing hole. What an adventure! My experience with this vehicle took place on the farm of a good friend of mine.  He knew how much I was interested in fruit harvesting.  He invited me to visit his farms with his family.  Who can resist the picking of beautiful nectarines, plums, peaches, and so?

<b>State-of-the-art machinery vs. traditional fruit picking, read hand-picking</b>

Despite all the expensive and heavy-duty pieces of equipment you may find on a farm, for the most part, fruit harvesting is still done manually.  The workers work fast to fill boxes which will be loaded onto the trailer of the F-150. The crew foreman made sure to encourage his workers to stay on tasks.  Somehow, he wanted to impress the <i>big boss</i>, my friend whom I will call Ben for the sake of this review.

Ben checked the fruit baskets, pulled a knife out of his back pocket and 
sliced a nectarine.  He munched on it and shook his head in agreement with the foreman.  All the while, the boxes continued to increase on the trailer.  &quot;Great fruit, great workers, but the picking is slow.  I don't want the bad weather to catch my fruit on the trees,&quot; Ben remarked.  

The foreman called my name.  &quot;This new truck is ready to go to the shed.  Will you drive it?&quot;  It was as if Ben had already told him what to do.  He joined in.  &quot;Good luck!&quot; he wished me. &quot;Come on, city guy; let me see how you can drive in the trenches.&quot;  I truly did not want to be asked twice.  I wanted to get behind the steering wheel of this monster truck!

It is my opinion that Ford has a winner in this truck.  It inpires security and reliability on the road.  It makes sense for Ford to come up with something like this.  So far, the F-150 has been a best-seller.  The pickup is just too hot for the market.  As I got inside, I realized that the SuperCrew has all the comfort you would find in a luxury vehicle.  It is a good ride even with the trailer full with nectarine boxes.  It is a user-friendly pickup.

<b>Let's take a good, deeper look at this vehicle</b>

The superCrew's standard engine is the 220-horsepower, 4.6 liter Triton V8.  The one I was driving was a 4x4 XLT 5.4-liter Triton V8. From the field to the shed, the truck just went smoothly over the potholes, gravels, piles of dirt and leaves.  No bumps bothered my load.  Here is what to consider if you think about buying this vehicle

4-wheel drive, 5 passenger, 4-door pickup

Engine:  16-valve, SOHC, 5.4-liter V8; Horsepower:  260 @ 4,5000 rpm; 4-speed automatic

How about its performance?  It can go from 0 to 60 mph; Fuel economy:  city/hwy:  14/18 mpg.

I made it to the shed without any problems.
