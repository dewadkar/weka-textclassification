            The truck is great for me and has been really reliable. I'm not easy on it either, I've only had it a year and it has over 30,000 miles on it! The things I miss the most about a larger SUV are the power and more secure feeling of a larger vehicle. The sportage feels just like a car so keep looking if it's not the feel you want. 

The sportage is pretty roomy, granted I'm only 5'4 but I share it with my fiance who is 6'0 and very large and he is comfortable in it. (just make sure you get the tilt wheel if you are large) You'll be surprised at the cargo space. The seats fold down easily and will even fit large pieces of furniture. Make the owner/dealer help you practice closing the tire rack a few times though- it's tricky. The truck is great for me, great warranty, cheap on gas, comfortable, and easy to maintain. Even when my headlights stopped working I was able to figure out on my own that the fuse was loose because everything is marked so clearly. 

I'm not crazy about the cupholder placement and the bottom snapped off and broke after a few weeks. I had to bring the truck in 3 times because the power windows wouldn't roll down. Third times a charm though and I haven't had the problem again. A squeal started a few months after I got it but the Kia mechanics are hard of hearing.... It's really very quiet inside though. I'm small and the truck is really light so I sometimes have handling problems in strong winds and difficulty braking. I have never felt like I was going to roll over though and I have a lead foot. The winds just carry me across lanes if my speed is over 65 on a windy highway. Keep a bag of rock salt in the back it will give it some weight. You may just want to pay the extra for ABS brakes, you'll get an extra 5% off your insurance anyway.
 
Bigger trucks make me feel safer and my family was afraid that the truck would fold if it was ever hit. I don't know how they hold up in accidents but someone hit my front end in a parking lot and did a lot of cosmetic damage, about $3,000. They thought it was truck because of the tow hook indent so I think they hold up pretty well. Good luck with your car hunt!
