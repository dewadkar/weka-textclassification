            The 1990 supra turbo is a solid 6 cylinder with great performance. Originally I bought the car to be my 2nd car for summertime use, but quickly found that I drive it almost every day. Yes, I have even gone on ski trips in this car, but one needs to be careful with the clutch on the ice.

The car has excellent power (200+HP), great fuel economy (24 mpg), has a low profile, great brakes and nice ride,  comfortable power seats, and a good feel of the road.  It is very easy to cruise on the highway at 70 mph and feel a bit bored in this car. The vehicle is 9 yrs old now, and has needed only minor repairs (battery, and muffler), and the maintenance costs are very low.

Only a few negatives.. the oil filter is hard to reach and a bit messy when lowering, and the 16&quot; tires can be expensive if you don't shop around.  The back seat is not for adults.

I suggest this car for anyone who loves to drive, does not want to constantly repair the little things, can afford the insurance, and has no kids (or kids under 5 yrs old).<br><br>
