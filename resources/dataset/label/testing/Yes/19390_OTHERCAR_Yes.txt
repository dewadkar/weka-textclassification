            I play soccer. Hence, my mother is a 'soccer mom.' So, as it seems to be a law of physics, she is drawn to minivans when shopping for a new vehicle. We've had cars in the past, and it just doesn't cut it when we have to carpool for practices and such. So, we opt for minivans.

I'm sick of writing in paragraphs, so I'm just going to list the features.

<b>Good Features:</b>
1. When put into gear, the doors automatically lock.
2. The sliding door on the right side closes when you push a button.
3. The color we picked (Cherry Ice)
4. The bucket seats
5. Decent trunk space

<b>Less-Than-Good Features:</b>
1. The accelerator is very sensitive.
2. The cupholders

As you can see, the good features override the less-than-good ones. I would recommend the van to anyone, even if you aren't a soccer mom.
