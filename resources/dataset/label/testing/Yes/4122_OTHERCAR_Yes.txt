            We bought this vehicle a little over a year ago, because we felt that if we got into a crash with someone, the other person would get injured instead of us.  Pretty good reason huh?  Well, it turns out that first of all, that is not the case, and second of all, the Pathfinder is really not that great of a SUV.  I will say that it looks nice.  It looks beautiful, and the inside is pretty decent.  But the engine on the Pathfinder is horribly underpowered.  It already eats up gas, but it still accelerates horribly!  Also, turning is very unstable in the Pathfinder.  I find myself stopping to about 10 miles an hour regularly just to make a normal right hand turn.  If I go above that, my tires start squealing!  A couple good things about the pathfinder are its stereo system.  It is a nice system, considering it comes along with the car.  With a CD player, and ncie speakers, everybody in the car will be able to hear crisp clear sound.  If you are looking for a performance SUV, dont buy the pathfinder.  If you're looking for a big bulky SUV that looks nice, but doesn't perform, buy the pathfinder.  <br><br>
