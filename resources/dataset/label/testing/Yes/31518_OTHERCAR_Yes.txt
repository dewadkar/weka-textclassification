            I have been looking for a replacement car for my aging 94 Metro. I have test driven several cars in my price range ($12K-14K) including Daewoo Lanos, Chevy Metro, Mazda Protege',  99 Nissan Sentra and just a week ago 2000 Sentra GXE. By far the 2000 Sentra is the best value for the money. For $14K I get a fully equipped stylish car that now boasts a 1.8L engine standard. I was quite impressed with the power and stability of the 2000 Sentra. Another reason for choosing the Sentra is the warranty is better than the other cars with the exception of the Lanos. Do yourself a favor and compare the cars mentioned with the new Sentra for styling, power, options, warranty, and value. I think you will come to the same conclusion I did. I plan to purchase the 2000 Sentra GXE with the convenience and luxury packages. These provide all the options of the SE except the larger engine for about $1500 less. The seats in the Sentra are very comfortable in front, passable in back. The car I test drove had great handling and a nice stereo (180W cd). I'm sold!<br><br>
