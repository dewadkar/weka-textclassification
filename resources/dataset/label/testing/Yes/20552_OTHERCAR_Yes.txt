            I purchased a 1999 Integra Coupe in September as my first new car after a careful consideration of many other makes and models. There are dream cars, and there is the car you know you will buy. The Integra neatly managed to fit both of these categories, much to my surprise.

Of course, my first choices were impossible ones like a BMW or a Mercedes-Benz. However, money made these impractical choices for me. Furthermore, I realized I would be buying a car based on a name, and I am not one who does that with anything else. It would be silly to do more. 

As my previous car was a '94 Civic EX, my first experience with the Integra was wonderful. It has the sporty look that I craved, and the leather seats were fairly roomy considering the size of the car. The interior is pleasant, and of course, the dash speedometer, etc., are the most easily readable dials I have seen in a car. It is an automatic, and I'd like to point out that the stick is very ergonomically designed. The interior, like the exterior, is elegant. I am not a person that buys a car for the engine, but I've found that it has good acceleration.

The one major drawback I find is that it is not a passenger car in the slightest, despite a roomy first two seats. The hatchback trunk on my car made carrying objects from place to place easy, but more than a passenger and a driver can be uncomfortable. Of course, if one was looking for large passenger capacity I doubt they would look at an Integra. 

The only other problem I have ever had with this car is the slowness in shifting up in gears on a hill. It can take a second or more than I am used to. But the fairly quiet ride that I normally get in the Integra, with a rather responsive wheel, is worth it.

The price is fairly easy when contrasted with other models-- if you want a car that's more inexpensive, buy a Civic. However, if you'd like something of better quality with a slightly more elegant styling and interior, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Acura Integra. <br><br>
