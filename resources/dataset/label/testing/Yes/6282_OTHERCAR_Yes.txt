            I purchased a 95 Galant starting in December of 1994 and within 3 months there was trouble with the transmission.  The dealer took the car for a week, gave me a rental and since getting the car back, it's been an excellent car for 5 1/2 years.  I haven't had to take the car for service for any reason other than new brakes, tires and new belts @ 65K miles.  

I find the ride to be smooth and quiet (except for interstate driving at 70mph+ where there is noticeable engine hum) and the handling to be good.  With 77K miles, the car still has pep reaching 60mph in under 10 seconds and topping out between 120-125mph.  Although the interior isn't as nice as the Camry or Accord, the front and back seats are more spacious and the dash is well laid out.  All things considered, I think the Galant is a wonderful value, providing dependability and a stylish design at an affordable price.<br><br>
