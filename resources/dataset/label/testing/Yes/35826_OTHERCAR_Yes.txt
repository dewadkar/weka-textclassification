            It's an old tired story of romance and love at first sight.  The midnight blue SL2 was at the back of the lot, all but forgotten by the sales staff, just waiting for us to find it.  Car sales had been slow and we were able to get a real deal on what my favorite mechanic had been term the best find on a used car he'd ever seen (seems the previous owned was upgrading to a SUV).

Popping the hood on the SL2 uncovers a sleek 4 cyl. Dual Over-Head Cam Engine, with more than enough power to make you feel like you could fly.  No, it's not as peppy as say the BMW M3s (or Z3), but were talking about a car that we intend to drive to work every day in rush hour, (and this baby can merge with the best of them) and day trips on the weekend.  One thing about the way cars ride.  A lot depends on what you like and what tires you put on the car, but for the most part American cars tend to glide down the road while Foreign cars tend to let you &quot;feel&quot; the road more.  I find on long trips the smooth riding Saturn is a lot more comfortable than the more, shall we say, Active ride of my Honda.

Unfortunately, I'd have to describe this a car as a women's car.  Not because of the power or styling but rather if you're a little tall, or shall we say bulky, then it's going to be a squeeze getting in and out of the car.  However, once you're in the molded seat, which gently conforms to your body, you'll find the cockpit is roomy, well designed, and with all the instruments readily accessible.  You'll have to drive it to see if you're a perfect fit, I'm not, but I am willing to sacrifice a moment of comfort getting into the car, for the hours of comfort while driving the car.   

Don't buy this car for the dent resistant panels, although they work as advertised, buy this car because it's going to get you where you want to go, in comfort and style as fast as you want (and at about 30mpg).

I have to agree with their propaganda, they sat down and designed a car in America that has the quality and features we have come to expect from only foreign cars.  Sure there's a squeak or two from the extensive use of plastic, yes some items on the car just feel/look cheap (like the ashtray), but over all, they put together a very nice package.
