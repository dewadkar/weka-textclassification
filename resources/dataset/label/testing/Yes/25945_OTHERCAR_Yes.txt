            I am driving a Grand Am right now because mine needs a new engine. I am looking for a new car at the moment. I rented a car from Avis, and got the Grand Am not by choice, but I am satisfied. It is a spacious car, with nice features. It has power steering,up and down power seat adjustment,and power windows. It has a very smooth ride, and great gas mileage. I have gone 300 miles, and still have 1/4 of a tank of gas.With the Ford Escort that I used to have, I would have to fill it up with gas within a couple of days after a trip like I took this weekend. I was very pleased with the comfortable ride, and outstanding audio system. It has AM/FM radio with a CD player in the dash.

I would recommend this car to people with families, and those who want roomy car with a sporty feel. By roomminess I mean the ability to fit a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; and by sporty feel I mean sleek look, and big engine.

 I personally don't care for it for me because I am short, and it is hard to see behind me on the drivers side. The adjustable seats just help to see over the dash. There is still a blind spot on the back driver side. I am glad that I have had a chance to drive the Grand Am so I know what it is like. Again, I think that it is a nice car, just not for me. If you are in the market for a new car, I would check the Grand Am out. You never really know until you drive it how it feels.
