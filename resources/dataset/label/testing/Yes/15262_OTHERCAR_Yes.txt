            I bought the Sony Mavica for two reasons: for my soccer website and my wife's School PTO website.  I run the website for the local soccer club and take action pictures at the games.  What I like about the Sony Mavica is the 3.5&quot; floppy disk. There are no cables or hookups. I simply remove it from the camera and pop it into my computer.  Then I use Microsoft Picture IT (a really great product) to crop, adjust contrast, brighten, etc.  Then I upload the pictures to my web site.  It's takes me no time at all.  

I really like the on-board menu system. You can review the pictures you just took and delete them if you wish.  The one button menu is very easy to use. Press the left side of the button and it takes you to the last picture. Press the right side to go to the next picture.  It is so intuitive that most people can figure it out with minimal instruction.

Another nice thing about the Mavica is that there are so many dealers, making the prices very competitive.  I bought mine from a company out of New York through CNET Shopping Network.  It was $100 cheaper than Best Buy.

When I'm ready to upgrade to the latest model (which might be pretty soon), I will definitely look at a Sony Mavica model. A satisfied customer always comes back. I have recommended this product to many of my friends and I know at least 5 people that own this model or another in the Mavica line.
