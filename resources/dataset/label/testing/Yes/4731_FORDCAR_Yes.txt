            The Ford Mustang is one of the most versatile cars on the market.  The reason for this is the amount of changes and enhancements that are possible for this type of car.  Not only are they fun and good looking but they are fast.  Now usually people look at the older mustangs and say the 5.0 was the best, but these days Ford has made a smaller 4.6L  car but has more horsepower under the hood than the older 5.0 models.  These size engines are out of control for cars as small as they are.  A V8 in a car this size?  That's just ridiculous.  That is why the Mustang is great for racing also.  And if you are still not satisfied with the speed and quickness that was given to these cars off of the assembly line then there are several enhancements you can add to the car to make the engine faster and the body lighter.  These are just all around great cars, with a great price too.<br><br>
