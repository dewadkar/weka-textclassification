            This review is for the 1995 Montero SR. 

The first time I drove a Montero was on my honeymoon in Arizona in late 93.  Over 1000 miles were spent very far off-road in a two week period and this vehicle (a 94 model)did not disappoint at all.  The balance of our time getting to and from various points of the desert southwest was extremely enjoyable thanks to the adjustable suspension.

Fast forward to 1998 and my purchase of my very own Montero. This vehicle is a 95 Montero SR purchased used with 56k miles.  It is loaded with leather interior, giant moonroof, cd changer, 4 spd. automatic, 3.5 liter V6 and third row sets to provide a total of 7 passenger seating.

I now have over 100k miles on this truck and the only repair has been replacement of the idle speed control.  I replaced it myself in 20 minutes with a used component for $125.  At the dealer, parts and labor will run you about $400.  BTW, the truck was still driveable with out the sensor connected.  

This is an extremely comfortable truck with three suspension setting for tight handling, average driving and soft ride on long trips.  There is also a transmission switch which allows for higher shift points to give you better passing ability.  The other position for this switch is a hold feature which allows you to start out in a higher gear in slippery conditions.  The Active-Trak 4 wheel drive system is marvelous providing excellent traction and handling in just about every imaginable weather condition. 

The 3.5 liter V6 makes 215hp and does a decent job of moving this truck along.  It's no rocket, but it's livable.
Fuel economy with this size engine in such a heavy truck suffers a bit, although I've seen 19mpg on trips on several occasions.

Seating position for the driver is excellent affording a high unobstructed view over most traffic and the seats are very comfortable.  My wife especially appreciates the height adjustable seats which aid shorter drivers considerably.  The third row seats fold down and are forward facing.  Access to them is a bit awkward since you must either fold the back seat down and climb in or climb in through the back before folding the seat down.  Useful for kids and comfortable for short trips for adults.  If you're not transporting a crowd, you can fold the rear seat flat and sit in the back fold down seat with an infant car seat next to you. My wife loved this when we went out with our first son. Legroom was like being in a limo and when stopped, the back seat could be folded flat to make a really neat changing table!

This has been and continues to be a wonderful vehicle for all trips long and short, on or off-road.
