<TEXT>
            After test driving the Honda CR-V, the Toyota RAV4, and the Subaru Forester, we choose the Forester due to its feel, drivability, and the reliability of its all-wheel drive system.  We have driven the '99 model for 12,000 miles and have had no major problems.

Two complaints about the Forester are that some of the interior items, e.g., cargo net hooks, are rather flimsy and detach from the car with minor pressure and that the vehicle handles like a &quot;Japanesse&quot; auto.  It does not have the feel and/or sense of the better European models.

With the back seat folded down, the storage capacity is quite adequate.  It can handle most purchases from Costco, Home Depot, etc.  With the back seats up, three to four golf bags can be stored (pull carts excluded).

The car is very easy to drive, easy to park, and rather nimble on the road.  There are a lot of little nooks and crannies for storage, with the one in the middle of the dash great for storing one's wallet.

This vehicle is great for a family of two to three, who may need some off-road capabilities, and want the traction of all-wheel drive.  This is not a macho SUV that somebody would take into the back woods and through river beds.

12/2/00 - Update
We now have 26k miles on our Forester and it has performed very well.  There have been no maintenance problems whatsoever (except for the replacement of the windshield due to a flying rock - very expensive and a small wind noise has since persisted from the replacement).  Also have noticed that the resale value for this car has remained very high.  Nothing but good things to say about this car.<br><br>
