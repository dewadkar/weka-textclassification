            I inherited my Caprice after my uncle's death in 1996. I have been driving her since my uncle bought her new off the lot in May 1983.
The Caprice Classic is one of the best cars GM ever put out. It is very dependable, little to no maintenance. It does drink gas, on the freeway it does get very good gas mileage, I can get up to 270 miles on a tank of gas. The ride is so smooth, the seats very comfy, and has lots of leg room.
If you want an older big dependable car &amp; can find one, get the Caprice made between 1977 - 1990. You will not be sorry.<br><br>
