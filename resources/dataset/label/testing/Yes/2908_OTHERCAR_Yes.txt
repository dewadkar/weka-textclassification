            <b>First to Have?</b>
I have actually seen the car BEFORE it was offically released.  The dealer just couldn't wait to be seen with it, making them "the first one to have it".  I test driven this car the next day.

<b>Style, It has Not</b>
My first impression of the RSX was that it looked like a 2000 Toyota Celica that just rammed into the 2001 Honda Civic.  What else can explain the head of a Civic and a body of the Celica?  The tail lights was an improvement, as they are rounded brake lights (much like the popular - and controversial - Altezza lights from many modified Integras).  However, instead of having a clear lens wraping around a red lens which houses the lights, they were round RED lens with red reflecting plastic around it.  No doubt that the first aftermarket lens would be just to make them clear...and easy fabrication.

It does takes a while to get used to.  The front end starts to look sexier, but the big ugly spot is the grille.  It is taking a cue from Acura's other cars, making it look luxurious than sporty (in a shape of an upsidedown triangle).  However, no amount of time (well, at least I'm not used to it YET) is when you view the car form the side.  It looks very much like a larger and higher standing Celica, which both cars have NO features... no lines, no design, no curves (except from top to botom, but that's like very car)... just a plain body.

A change from Integra's "dated" look, the RSX simply looks much more Acura-like.  For me, that means it looks much more BORING.  The only distinct lines are on the edges, making it seem a bit box-like, though not exactly boxy.  I still think the Integra looks very modern, and about the only things Acura should change in terms of style is the tail lights and the interior that looks like a late 80s/early 90s dash and center stack.

The interior of the RSX looks like the Honda Insight, with a center stack that looks like it just belongs to the driver (no touchy touchy, passenger person you!).  It is contoured with the driver in mind.  The gauges are the only thing that is different.  Instead of just having white/silver gauges like most wanna-be compact sports, Acura also gave it a little "texture".  The gauges are actually shaped in a way that I cannot describe.  You must see it!  The edges of each gauge kind of bulges or curves towards you, while as you move towards the center of the gauges, they go away...kind of like a dip.  Each gauge basically looks like a plate.

<b>Living in the car</b>
Cupholders are done in the same way as ecno cars, which gives this car a slight cheap feel to it.  They are in the front, near the floor.  Most large and/or expensive cars have them in the middle.  I guess it's about tastes, too, since some of us would rather use that space  as an armrest.

The stereo is a Bose system with a subwoofer on the spare tire.  I thought this was kind of weird, and wondered how it would actually affect the sound if it was located ALLLLL they way back and under there.  Nonetheless, the sound is very boomy, and thanks to the high and mid range from the front, very clear.  Thank goodness it comes with both a CD and casstte player, as there seems to be NO WAY to add on a normal DIN sized head unit if you feel the need to change the stereo.  I still think that stinks, as I would love to put in my JVC KD-SH99 (MP3-CD player) head unit.  Perhaps, like the Y2K Nissan Sentra, it really IS a DIN, but just need a dask kit.  Other than being a Bose, the factory stereo is very boring, and very typical factory.

The seats are very grippy, which is required, since you will definately be driving like you need it!  The rear seats are comfortable for a relativly long drive, which is surprising for a car in this class.  It almost feel like a sedan in the back!  A luxury Acura sedan, in fact.  Of course, this is due in the part of leather seats, too.

<b>Vrroom, Vroom!</b>
And vrroom vrroom is right!  This car packs a punch!  Don't let the numbers fool you!  The Type-S (I driven) has 200 HP but only at 7400 RPM!  Most of us don't drive that hard, but it's nice to know that all those horses are ready to go when you need them.  You will only get 160 HP at 6500 RPM on the base RSX.  Though not so torquey with a 142 ft-lb at 6000 RPM, it sure doesn't feel like it off the light.  It pulls like nobody's business, pushing back into the plush leather seats!  A great place to be, anyways.  The base RSX has about the same torque, which is surprising...at 141 ft-lb spinning at 4000 RPM.  This gives the base RSX more low-end torque.  Although this should mean that the base RSX would pull out more than the Type S from stop, this isn't proven yet, as I only test-drove it.  I would LOVE to take these cars out to find out, though!

Both trims use the same DOHC i-VTEC (VTEC with Intelligence) 16 valve 2.0 liter engine.  That's a mouthful!  The only other four cylinder 2.0 liter engine I know of that does more is the 240 HP Honda S2000 (though with torque around the 130 ft/lb range)!  We're talking about naturally aspired engines...otherwise, the kudos goes to Subaru's WRX STi (260 HP with about 260 lb/ft).

With the standard 6-speed for the S-enabled car, and a 5-speed for the base, both feel up to the challege when driven hard.  The stick is very willing to snap into every gear without hesitation...almost video-game like.  No vibrations was felt on the stick, which makes me wonder if this was a cable-linked stick instead of the more reliable rod-linked.  Rod-linked sticks transmit the vibrations of the engine and tranny because of the physical rod, while cabled ones are isolated from the crudeness since the cable absorbs most of the harshess of reality under the hood and car.  Both Type-S and the base have the same final gear ratio (in manual) of 4.388:1, which makes me wonder if the base car rev just the same as the Type-S on it's final gear (5th).  This doesn't make me feel any better if I decide to get a Type-S over the base car.  The optional 4-speed automatic (RSX base only) have a final drive of 4.562:1.  This means that the engine must turn 4.562 times before the wheels turn once around.  As you can see, the lower the number, the faster the wheel will spin in relative to the engine RPM.  Of course, if the drive ratio was 1:1, then your engine may not have enouogh power to even move the car.  Don't we all just LOVE gears?  :)

My personal opinions?  This car was very easy to drive.  You don't need much to get used to it, as it drives like any other Honda (a good thing, BTW).  It feels more refined, however, than any Honda and Integra, giving a quieter and smoother ride.  The engine sounds like it has a turbo in it, but rest assured, it's wide open for anyone to drop one in (if they make them that is).

<b>Recomendation</b>
There is NOTHING perfect on the market today.  The Sentra SE-R is a Nissan (which I have the SE version)...I won't buy another Nissan because of their quality issues (lots of interior noise sqeaking and rattling)...  The RSX ...even though it looks bland....feels great, but too new for any aftermarket parts (if you're into that).

We need a performace car with Honda's sturdiness, popularity, and Nissan's strong and fast engines!  None of those two have styling down right.  Oh well... you can't have it all.  :(
