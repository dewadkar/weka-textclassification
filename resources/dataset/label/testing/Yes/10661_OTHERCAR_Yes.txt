            I absolutely love my Grand Voyageur!  We went from a light truck to the van and the room alone was a big seller.  It's smooth, quiet ride and comfort is impressive to say the least.  This vehicle is suitable for anything from a family of 5 to a couple who need the room to cart sporting equipment or accommodate travel.

I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who might be considering it.  It's a great bang for your buck price wise and comes equipped with all of the standard features that you would expect for a vehicle of this class and more. <br><br>
