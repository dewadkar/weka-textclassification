            I just purchased a new 2003 Element 4WD DX, Automatic & Air Conditioning.  So far it has ran like a dream.  

After owning a '96 Acura Integra SE for 5 years, I expected a large, bulky, top-heavy, hard to maneuver truck and was a little hesitant when I arrived at the dealership.  But at the first test drive I was astounded by the smooth and responsive performance of the Element.

The "Stadium Seating" in the back of the Element give the back passengers a full view of the road even from the back seat, while the placement of the seats gives 4 adults room to stretch out and enjoy the ride.  This would be a perfect road trip car.

Made on the same technology as other Honda successes, such as the CRV's suspension system and the Accord's 4 cylinder engine, the Element promises to be a long lasting and fun to drive car.  With 160 horsepower, you won't notice much lag when starting out, even with the A/C at full blast.  The element also boasts a 21MPG/27MPG fuel consumption ratio, and is also listed as an LEV (Low Emission Vehicle), which can land you a tax break in certain areas.

The best part of being in this car are the confused stares you get from everyone as you drive down the street!  Most people seem taken aback by the design, but end up loving the car when they have a chance to sit in the roomy interior for a quick drive.

All in all, I would highly recommend the Honda Element.  At least drive one before you judge it.  I have only owned mine for 1,000 miles, but I expect many more miles of worry free driving.
