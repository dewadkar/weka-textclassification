            Having always owned small and efficient automobiles, my wife and I found ourselves in the market for a new car two years ago.  I am the sort of person who is meticulous about upkeep and maintenance and usually keeps a vehicle until it is well over 100,000 miles.  

Over the years I have owned small vehicles from Subaru, Toyota, Dodge, Saturn, Mitsubishi and Ford.   Each manufacturers vehicle would often have its strong and weak points such as; good acceleration but lousy reliability, good front seat comfort but cramped rear passenger space, great fuel economy but a terrible ride.  Our Protege is the first small car we have ever owned which blends all of the good points about a small car, while eliminating almost all of the bad.  

With over 40,000 miles in two years this car has demonstrated bullet-proof reliability.  We did have a problem with the cars brakes, (they were making a noise). When we brought it in for service we were treated very well and given a rental car with all cost coming out of the manufacturers warranty.  I have never received such service, even from the &quot;different kind of car company&quot;.  

Our LX model has a surprisingly spacious and accommodating interior with very good fit and finish.  The AC is ice cold even on the hottest Midwestern August afternoon.  The factory CD/radio has received many complements from passengers on its high quality sound.  Other standard accessories included split folding rear seats, power windows, locks and mirrors, variable effort power steering, remote trunk release, Tilt wheel and cruise control.  The front seats are very firm and supportive providing hours of comfort especially on two cross-country road trips.  front headroom is excellent, at 6'2&quot; it is the first small car in which I do not have to slouch!  The rear seats are comfortable as well with plenty of leg and head room for two six footers.  

The 1.5 liter engine, is not a powerhouse, but provides adequate acceleration.  The best part about this engine is just how silky smooth and quiet it is, especially at idle.  High speed cruising is not a chore either.  At highway speeds there is no characteristic small engine buzzing.  The car has a 5spd transmission with short sportscar-like throws and buttery clutch.  Mileage has been excellent as well with the Protege returning and overall average of 35mpg.  On a recent trip from Kansas City, MO to Breckenridge, CO we average 70mph and 37mpg, just fantastic!  

The only negative about the car so far has been it's original equipment tires.  They are Bridgestone 195/65 14's and are H speed rated.  While they have worn very well and provide excellent dry road grip, they have never had the wet traction grip I am used to with non-speed rated all season radials.  I will remedy that when it comes time to replace them with a set of Goodyears or Michelins.  

In summary I would say this car is an excellent overall effort from Mazda!  <br><br>
