            The 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse RS is a great, inexpensive car with class and style.
The 1999 Model is the last of the �smooth body� design before the car adapted the 3 �shark gills� down the sides of the doors for the year 2000.  As far as I can tell, opinions on the new look seem to be divided.  But if you prefer a sleek look, I recommend a model before the 2000 release.  

While car shopping, I wanted a sports car that was affordable, but that still maintained an attitude of elegance to it.  The Eclipse delivers on both accounts.   I paid close attention to specials and sales going on at the local dealership before purchasing.  Often, when car lots get too full of a particular model, they will hold a sale on that car and drastically reduce the price.  The usual ticket for an Eclipse with standard features is around $17,700.   However, I was able to catch one of these sales and bought my car at $13,900.   With even a modest trade-in, this makes the car highly affordable.  (A lot of economy cars are in the $11,000 or $12,000 range).   This included A/C, FM/AM CD player as well.   I was able to save money by staying away from Power windows, cruise control, etc.

I recommend whenever buying a sports car, to buy the 5-speed.  This is for starters, just more fun! The responsiveness of the vehicle is incredible.  The Eclipse handles extremely nice on the road. On the 5-speed, it has very quick pickup. Since it is a relatively light car, this make it�s a little more dangerous in wet road conditions, but since the car is so responsive, it is also very easy to regain control of.  Also, the car simply gets GREAT gas mileage.  On a full tank of premium gas, I can get at least 350, to 400 miles out of the car before needing to refill again.  You just can�t beat that!

While I may have many praises to sing about the Eclipse, there are some minor drawbacks.   One of the biggest nuciances is with the turn signal indicators.  The car is equipped with tilt steering; however, most drivers will have to have the steering wheel tilted in the �up� position so that they have room for their legs.  When the steering is tilted �up�, the top part of the wheel actually blocks the drivers line-of-site to the turn signal indicators.  You literally cannot see them at all.  The car does not come with a �dummy bell�, so it is common to find that your signals are on and you didn�t even know it.  I just see this as poor engineering and I hope that this oversight is corrected in later models.  Also, I have heard (and experienced this myself) that is some cases the factory has put too much weather protection seal inside the doors.  The weather seal is a black, tar like substance, that if there is too much, can �drip� onto the frame of the door.  If there is an excessive amount, it may also get into the locking mechanism and cause the locks to stick.   However, to Mitsubishi�s credit, the dealer was very quick to resolve this matter with me. The seal leaves no permanent mark on the doorframe either.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is seeking a sporty car without wanting to pay tons of money.  You can enjoy a sense of adventure and practicality at the same time.
