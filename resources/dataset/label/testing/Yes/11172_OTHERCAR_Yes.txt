            My first car was a 1968 Buick Special Deluxe 6 passenger station wagon I purchased in 1981 at age 16 for $650.00. Despite being a station wagon, the car was very stylish with sleek classic 60s lines. The car was in very good condition requiring just a little effort to buff a slightly oxidized finish. The interior was like brand-new. This exceptional automobile not only took me through high school and college but my took younger brother through college and beyond. 

The Special Deluxe was the base model of the Buick mid-size line (i.e. Skylark). Despite its base model status, this was still a very attractive car with its teal blue mist finish and white enamel top. It hard a medium blue vinyl interior with AM radio and power rear window. It rode on 14&quot; Goodyear bias-ply white stripe tires with full wheel disks. My car had Buick's 350 (5.7 litre) cid V-8 with 2 bbl carb giving a very respectable 230 hp. It was mated to a Hydramatic two-speed automatic that was damn near indestructible. 

This car handled very well and could hold its own in nasty N.E. Pennsylvania winters with merely the application of snow tires. Despite its antiquated all-drum brakes, the car could stop on a dime. Gas mileage (regular leaded) was a very respectable 19 mpg for a 1968 intermediate which would be bigger than today's full-size car. My brother, using the appropriate additives, was able to run the car using regular unleaded when leaded gasoline was phased out in Pennsylvania in the late 80s.  

Repairs were a snap. This car was beauty in its simplicity. All engine components were easy to identify. Today you open the hood of a car and you don't know what you're looking at. Replacing a water pump took a mere 20 minutes! I would dread having to perform this task with today's cars. Spark plugs? No problem! Parts were cheap and plentiful. Repairs can be done by anybody with rudimentary mechanical skills. Besides replacing the water pump, the car asked nothing of me except basic maintenance, (oil change, transmission fluid change, belts, brakes, etc.).

There was plenty of room for cargo in the back. Perhaps much more than a modern SUV. I was almost able to haul the contents of entire college apartment in the back with the rear seat folded down. 

One of the things I didn't like was access to the spare tire. The spare was stowed in a compartment on the right rear of the car and required the strength of Schwarzenegger to lift from its deep well. If that wasn't bad enough, removing and replacing the jack was also a chore. 

Ergonomics were a joke in 1968. The seats had about as much support as your average park bench. Your back would hurt after a while on long trips. The heater controls were two tiny thumbwheels you had to constantly crank to get to the proper setting. The horn button was a longitudinal piece in the lower bottom 2/3 of the steering wheel that required one to take his hand off the wheel to activate. You almost needed gorilla arms to reach the radio. I later hung an AM/FM cassette unit from the bottom of the dash. I didn't want to remove the original Sonomatic radio with its cool &quot;BUICK&quot; lettering on the buttons.

Two other things were that the shine on a teal blue mist finish doesn't last long and required me to polish the car every two weeks and that bias-ply tires don't last as long as today's steel-belted radials. As an aside - don't mix bias tires with radials. It will very adversely affect handling. 

I drove this car until I bought my first new car in 1987 and gave the station wagon to my brother. Unfortunately, my brother doesn't maintain cars very well. The body began to rust and the car soon lost all of its hubcaps but despite his neglect the car still ran until 1992! Even then all the car needed was a new battery, but the body was pretty much shot. Mechanically, the car was still bulletproof. After the wagon went to the boneyard my father gave my brother his old 1981 Ford Thunderbird. My brother later said, &quot;I should've kept that station wagon. It was a much better car!&quot; If you can still find one of these Buicks - go for it and keep it forever!<br><br>
