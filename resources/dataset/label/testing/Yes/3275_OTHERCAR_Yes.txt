            I have just over 600kms on my new 2002 Solara SE. Yes, the 2004's are almost out - making me very happy I was able to purchase this body style after seeing the new one! With Access Toyota's (what a ripoff) non-bargaining policy on the new 2003 models in Canada I was forced to ferret out the last new 2002 available here in BC. I was able to save $3000 on this model for my efforts - thanks carcostcanada.com!  
Anyway, i am very happy with this car all around. The best part of driving this vehicle around is not seeing your vehicle double at every stop light. And nobody really recognizes it upon sight and thinks its a really nice looking ride. That is on top of Toyota's bullet proof reliability. 
This car rides very smooth and has plenty of get up and go for a 4 banger. I did test drive the 200 hp V6 and it of course picked up a whole lot faster. But with the higher insurance and gas prices i opted for the 4, and am very pleased. This car drove like the big coupe it is however...you don't feel like you are in a smaller car than you are - make no mistake this car is tilted towards luxury and comfort than it is sport. Saying that, it handles well for its size and weight and i seem to be getting great gas mileage so far. The steering is stiff when comparing it to my nissan, but it is so much more quiet - you can hardly hear anything - except the nice sounding stereo. Quite a suprise considering the frameless door windows! I would recommed you get some seat covers unless you don't mind alot of lint stuck to your seats. The big doors are a bit of a chore in tight  parking spots, but they do stop on their own in several spots until they are fully open. I get lots of looks and lots of inquiries and i love the attention it attracts. If you are considering the Solara, go for it, you won't be disappointed. Just hurry, the 2004's are really ugly!
