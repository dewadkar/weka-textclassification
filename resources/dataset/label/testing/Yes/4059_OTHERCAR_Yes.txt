            When I became a rep for HP, we decided that although my Honda Accord was a terrific car, that there just wasn't enough room for all the boxes of POP I had to carry and a stoller and a portacrib for my one year old at the time.  Plus her car seat looked way too big on the back seat of the Accord.  So we looked around.  We drove a SUV for the weekend and had pretty much decided that it didn't offer much more room than my car.  After all, you can only pile boxes so high before they land on the kids lap, right?

So we drove this minivan and everytime my husband said the word &quot;minivan&quot; I would shudder.  I dreaded being stereotyped &quot;that kind of mom&quot; ... you know the kind... aka chaufers to soccer practice, cheerleading tryouts, etc.  If you still drive a car you are kinda cool still, right?

Well, I have learned to love my van.  My parents come frequently to visit from another state and I used to have to borrow a friends van to pick everyone up!  When something needs moved, it gets done easily and quickly.

BUT what I really love are the built in car seats.  I have two of them and they fit children reallly well and I can either have another child or take a friend with a child with me!  IT's great!  I have truly learned to love this van!

This van also gets great mileage.  I drive to Florida from TN and I get nearly 600 miles before I get gas and I fill up at 1/4 tank.  Not bad.  Considering the gas prices these days, not too bad at all.  We need all the help we can get! (Drivers in the US)

This van has eight places to place drinks.  THe seats fold down and on the back of them are places for drinks or drink boxes.  There are holders in the front doors.  There are cup holders attached to the passenger seat up front as well as one of the back seats.

The seats can be rather heavy but once you have them in the van, are easy to place.  They fold down and even fold down again into a rather compact scene.  They fold right up against the front seats making a lot of room in the back for hauling things.  The 3rd row of seats in my van are usually sitting in my garage since there is only me, my husband, and daughter in our immediate family.. oh! don't forget our new puppy!  We have the extended version of this van which makes it nice.

The rear control air conditioning can be helpful on longer trips.  A lot of times my husband or I will climb in the back to help entertain my two year old.  From there, they can decide if they want it warmer or colder without having to ask me to do it.  It comes in handy if the people sitting in the back like it colder or warmer than the driver!

In the back of the van, there is also another data port/cigarette lighter so you can use it for plugging in appliances, games, etc.  I haven't used this but haven't had the need yet.  People that go camping, etc would find this very useful, I would imagine.

Some of the versions of this van come with an air compressor.  Now that would be cool.  Some versions also have automatic windows in the back.  They only open an inch or so but they can now be controled by the driver while driving by the push of a button.  That would be nice too!

We have not had to have this van in the shop for anything other than tire changes and oil changes.  It has been very dependable.  I have no regrets buying this van although I miss having a regular car sometimes.

OK... it appears my epinion isn't built with enough &quot;stats&quot; for the guys out there.  So, me not being a &quot;stat&quot; person, will try to add some integrity of &quot;stats&quot; into this epinion.

This van is a six cylinder van.  It has the 3400 V6 Engine.  When I hit the gas, it goes.  Technical Features of the 3400 V6 Engine:

* Sequential Fuel Injection 

* Forged alloy steel connecting rods 

* &quot;Assembled&quot; steel camshaft 

* Low coolant and low oil level indicators 

* Towing capacity of 3,500 lbs. when equipped with the optional Trailering Provisions Package and proper trailering equipment 

* Engine protection mode 

* OBD II (don't ask me what this is!!!!!!!!  I simply don't know!  LOL)

* Low-friction roller rocker arms and roller lifters 

* 24x ignition system 

* Engine acoustic cover 
***********************************************************************
The brakes are power front disc/rear drum with 4-wheel antilock.  I have never had trouble stopping this van on a dime.  My husband has replaced the brake pads and they were easy to change.  We have had cars that required a special tool and that was a pain.

The Venture has Daytime Running Lamps.  They stay on at all times when the van is running.  When the day turns to evening or you are in a tunnel or it gets dark due to a storm, there is a sensor that automatically turns the full lights on.  I haven't had to replace a light yet in this van.   The downside to this is that you can't turn the headlights off while the motor is running.  I came up on a deer in the road one night and he was stunned by my headlights.  I couldn't turn them off without turning the engine off and I wasn't about to turn the engine off in the middle of the road.


One feature is the steering column Tilt-Wheel.  This allows you to tilt the steering wheel to the position that is the best for you.  This is pretty much common in most cars these days.

Cruise control - This is another feature that is pretty common but is not in some of the lower end models of cars.  It is well worth it to have cruise control.  It mades long trips much more relaxing.  

This vehicle has driver and front-passenger, side impact bags.  Side impact bags are important if I get side swiped.  Not all cars have these although I think it is becoming more standard and I am not sure, but think there is a law passed that cars must have this by a certian year.  

My Venture is the extended wheelbase version.  That is the reason for the rear heating controls.  I have a lot of space behind my third row of seats compared to the normal version.  I normally just keep the second row in though and have plenty of space for cargo.

Ventures have double sliding doors on both sides of the van making it extremely easy to access the van for many reasons.  Number one - if you have more than one child, you do not need to climb over the one child to reach the other.  No more aerobics just to buckle the children in!  Number two - getting into the third row of seats is easier now too.  You can get to it via both sides.

The radio in my van is the standard GM am/fm with a cassette player.  I wish it had the cd player.  Perhaps someday.

The last thing about this van is that it drives and handles just like my car used to.  It is not so tall that I feel like I am driving a skyscraper.  When I make turns, I do not worry that I am going to hit a curb or anything.  It is a V6 unlike my Honda though.  But my Supra was a V6 and I missed having that extra little bit of power when I needed it most, such as passing cars or getting out of a tight spot.  The controls are all easy to reach and it is easy to see them, even in the dark.

Thanks for reading!

P.S. I have no clue what horsepower it is!  :)<br><br>
