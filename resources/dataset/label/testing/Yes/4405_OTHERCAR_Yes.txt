            I just bought one of these that was refurbished.  I am 100% pleased with the camera.  This is my 2nd digital camera.  My 1st one was an old 640x480 free camera from earthlink.  And I couldn't be happier with the upgrade.

The Kodak CX4300 produces pictures that are stunningly clear.  You can print a picture up to 11"x14", so this will meet any non-professional need you have.  Even the lowest resolution is really amazing.  I never have to use anything but the lowest setting unless I want to print big pictures.

It has an easy to use menu.  Nice LCD screen, although I don't recommend using it because it drains the battery.

Battery use is the only potential bad thing about the camera.  As with all digital cameras, you MUST buy rechargables if you don't want to waste money.  I recommend the new rayovac NiMH batteries.  They charge in only an hour, compared to 15 hours for other brands, and they do not have the stupid memory problems that so many batteries have.  The batteries supposedly last for 1000 charges, so it will pay for itself.  One set should last for 100 to 200 photos if you don't use the LCD screen too much.  The Lithium's will supposedly last for 300 photos.

This camera will also take a Secure Digital (SD) or MultiMedia Card (MMC), which can be found super cheap now.  With a 256 MB card, which can be found from $50 to $80, you can store from 250 to over 700 photos.

The built in 16 MB of memory holds around 45 photos on the lowest setting, and 15 or 16 on the highest.

There is an optional docking station, but most people will agree that it is priced way to high at around eighty dollars.  Just buy some rechargable batteries and a charger separately.

It seems to work great in low light conditions.  My house is known to have horrible lighting for pictures, but everything I have taken so far has come out great.

This is an awesome, cheap camera for someone who is a beginner in the world of digital cameras.
