            The 89 Nissan Sentra has been a very good car for me.  While this car is more than 10 years old, manufactured in 1988, it has required very little maintenance.

This car was purchased for me in 1997, since then, the only repair expenses, besides normal maintenance, have come because the bright light apparatus had worn out and because of an inexpensive oil leak.

This car gets great gas mileage (between 30-35 mpg hwy) and has enough power to make you feel like you're driving a newer, more sporty vehicle.  Also, it is small enough to easily maneuver any parking lot or crowded street, without driving like most low-powered compact cars.  I would recommend this car, as an inexpensive, efficient, economical car.<br><br>
