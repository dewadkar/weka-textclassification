            My wife and I bought an Oldsmobile Intrigue this evening.  It is the fourth Oldsmobile we have purchased.
In December of last year, I bought my wife a 1999 Olds Alero.  She loves the car.  This evening, I traded in my Olds Cierra SL for a new 2001 Olds Intrigue GX.  GX is the lowest of the class.  Next step up is a GL, and then a GLS.  They are all basically the same car.
The higher up the ladder you go, the more you pay for things like leather, more deluxe sound systems, and other creature comforts.  Me, I buy a vehicle to get me from point A to point B.  I just want to know the car is safe, will be reasonably comfortable.  I am much more concerned with leg and head room for all passengers than I am with cloth versus leather upholstery, or dimension versus Bose sound.  I will leave the sun roofs to warmer climes than the northeastern US, and spoiler bars to Indy 500 drivers.
Even the GX has some creature comforts.  The seat has six way controls, there is plenty of head and leg room, and the steering wheel can be moved out of the way for easier entry and exit from the vehicle in cramped parking conditions.  The car boasts a CD, audio cassette, and AM-FM radio. Dr. Bose will have to seek his royalties on higher priced models.
When you operate the directional signal, a special light illuminates the road on the side you are turning toward in the corner of the car.  This improves vision.  The visors have extenders.  This too shuts out unwanted glare when you drive into sunrises and sunsets.  
Of course, the car is better engineered than my 1996 Cierra SL. Engineering would be an evolutionary field.  The traction, the brakes, and the fuel efficiency have all been improved.  The car rides very quietly.  It takes potholes well.  It has good pick up for entry and passing on interstates.  It is a smooth ride which corners well.
To protect ourselves, we went to greenlight.com to find out the real Kelly Blue Book value of the trade in, and the actual invoice price.  Sales people being sales people (is there no shame?), they denied the veracity of our research.  So we went through the cat and mouse game of us leaving the dealership, saying we would not buy at their price.  And of course, they back peddled, back peddled some more, made one hundred different counter offers to confuse us and wear us down.
After three and one half hours, we settled on the price I originally demanded as the deal closer.  Well, GM cannot deny the sales staff tried.
As always, we do not buy vehicles unless we can buy them for cash.  The absolute worse thing a consumer can do is to finance an auto through a dealership.  If you go that route, you spend one and one half cars to buy an auto.  Pay as you go, or take the blow!
GM will be phasing out the Oldsmobile.  Not to worry.  You can still get parts and service at any GM dealership.  If you have recently bought an Oldsmobile (1996 or later), you will get a credit for $1,500 from GM towards the lease and purchase of a new one in January of 2001.  Given the end of the year rebates, and other discounts, you may well be buying more car for less money than getting a comparable Buick (roughly the same car, class for class).
When they eliminate the Olds, I shall miss them.  Meanwhile, my wife and I plan to be Intrigued by our new 2001 Olds.
Come join us on the freeway, which is already in progress.                           <br><br>
