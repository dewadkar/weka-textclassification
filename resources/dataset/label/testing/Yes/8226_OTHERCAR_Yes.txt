            One child and 105,000 miles later, we decided it was time to trade in our Lexus GS300 for something with more room to haul baby items.

My husband and I were comparing the Toyota 4-Runner, Toyota Land Cruiser, Honda Passport, and the Lexus RX300.  I kept mentioning the QX4 but my husband kind of brushed off the idea because he thought they were too expensive.  After owning our Lexus for a while and having driven the others we decided we wanted something with more luxury and choose the QX4.

The inside of the QX4 is well designed.  All the buttons and accessories are accessible and well placed.  I liked the fact that all you had to do was turn a knob and you could choose 2WD, AWD or lock it and use 4WD.  The wood finishing on the inside make the car look very classy.  The seats are very comfortable even on long trips.  The visibility in this car is outstanding with no blind spots because the spare tire is mounted underneath.  There is also an overhead display right in front of the moonroof buttons that shows the current temp outside as well as the direction you are going.  My husband also likes the compartment above for sunglasses.  

The back is very roomy and you can haul large items without a problem.  This has come in handy for us because of all my sons things that we take with us on trips.

There are only a few quirks with this sport utility but it pretty much goes without saying for any sport utility.  One being gas mileage.  With the price of gas rising, and requiring premium gas, it costs $40 to fill up the tank and then that only lasts a week with minimal driving.  

Another problem is that if you are used to driving a car, this definitely drives like a truck with a lot of tire noise.  Personally, I like that feeling but if you are spending a chunk of money on a luxury SUV, some people may find that annoying.  

The last thing that could use improving is the placement of the clock.  When you are listening to the radio, the clock isn't visible.  When you click the clock button, the radio or cd info disappears and then the time appears very small.  It would be better if it was all on the same display or if the clock was placed elsewhere so you always have the time handy.  

Other than that, I've been extremely pleased with the QX4!  I love sitting up higher and my son loves being able to see out.
