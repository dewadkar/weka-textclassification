            I bought my Geo Prizm as a &quot;Program Car&quot; in December, 1990. A news ad touting the Prizm as one of Consumer Report's top compact buys of the year convinced me to try it out.  Also, the vehicles predecessor, the Chevy Nova, was highly rated as a used car buy. I was immediately impressed with how &quot;solid&quot; the car felt compared with other compacts.  The engine ran so quietly that at first I restarted the engine thinking it had died.  I chose a car with 24K, reasoning that any bugs it might have had coming off the line would have been worked out by then.  

Nearly 10 years later, I have yet to regret the choice.  The car is running strong at 187,000+ miles.  As a business travel car, it has been absolutely reliable.  Highway gas mileage has remained a steady 36 mpg.  It has taken me from Oklahoma to San Diego and back three times without a single break-down.  The pick-up on Interstate access is still outstanding for a small car.  

Regular maintenance undoubtedly accounts for much of my good fortune with this car.  However, I have had to replace front CV boots at around 98,000 miles.  I did have trouble with the electrical wiring leading to the rear break lights at around 125,000.  A slight leaking problem around the rubber molding loosened the cloth headliner at around 130,000 miles.  All of these constitute minor repairs and did not significantly impact the car's overall performance.  <br><br>
