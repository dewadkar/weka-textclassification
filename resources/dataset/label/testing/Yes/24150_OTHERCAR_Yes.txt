            The camera is jam-packed with usable features and the download via USB is very fast and convenient.  The included rechargeable batteries, charger, and full compliment of cables is excellent; even the video is of value.  The optics of the camera are superb, very crisp pictures from macro to infinity.  However (and you knew this was coming), the color rendering left much to be desired.  The red on a can of Weldwood Contact Cement (used for testing) appeared orange, and an orange magic marker appeared yellow.

UPDATE ! ! !  I just read in another review that the orange color could have been caused by fluorescent lighting!  WOW!  Why didn't I know that when I took the pictures and was consulting with experts!  As a result, I will upgrade this camera to a &quot;4&quot; (next to highest).  Now I wish I hadn't returned it.

Also the flash had trouble brightening a room sufficiently when there was snow outdoors viewable through the windows... the &quot;fill&quot; mode just didn't cut it.  The customer service folks are EXCELLENT and they said that they would recalibrate the camera (for free) to correct the color problem.  But, I just didn't have a warm feeling for having that done and the flash problem bother me enough so that I returned the entire package.  From what I gather from other folks, they have not had similar problems.  I have not bought another digital camera yet but am considering the Kodak DC290 and the Olympus 3030.<br><br>
