            <i>After having bought the 2000 Corolla last August and used up about 15,000 miles, experience teaches a few things I didn't learn when I bought this car at the dealership, so I thought I'd share some of it with you</i>.

1. <b>Engine</b>: At 1.8L and 125 Horsepower, I expected a bit more zip but after driving my friend's 1999 Corolla which has 120 Horsepower, there is no difference at all in the two even though his car has racked up more mileage. It shouldn't be a surprise considering Corolla engines are not known for power but rather consistency, still, since they advertised the extra 5 Hp as meaning something, I would have expected to feel a difference. <i>Grade: C</i>

2. <b>Fuel Economy</b>: This was a really pleasant surprise to me as my Corolla had an approximate fuel economy rate of 36MPG (Auto. transmission) during long trips. Overall, you wouldn't find a car in this category doing better, and considering the high gas prices, a few miles extra per gallon could save you a couple hundred a year depending on how much you drive. Grade: <i>A+</i>

3. <b>Handling</b>: I expected more, but to be honest, sometimes I feel like I'm driving a Tercel (changed to Echo from the year 2000), and that's not a good thing. Its just not a very smooth ride especially on the highway. For smooth rides, I recommend the Honda Civic (for cars in the same price range). <i>Grade: B-</i>

4. <b>Wheels</b>: Also, there's a slight alignment problem already. I took it back to the dealership and after tinkering with it, their conclusion was that it was not &quot;completely&quot; a manufacturer's defect which meant that I would have had to dole out $415 to get it fixed. Sorry but I don't spent money on 7 month old cars! Tire wear is quite good so far though. The tire size is also big for this class of cars which should theoretically allow greater control at higher speeds. <i>Grade: C-</i>

5. <b>Braking</b>: Not sure if ABS brakes is an option but my <b>LE Edition</b> does not have it. However, its Disc/Drum system didn't cause me any worries even when driving up to Canada in the middle of winter. <i>Grade: B+</i>

6. <b>Service</b>: Toyota car service has for me, always been prompt, although you have to schedule them for an appointment even if it is just an oil change because the one in my area is always busy. All Toyota Corolla 2000 owners should consider themselves lucky since we only have to go in for an oil change every 4500 miles unlike the 3000 miles of previous Corollas. Does this foretell good things about the lasting power of the 2000 engine? I really hope so. At about 22,500 miles you are expected to go in for a full service &quot;check-up&quot;. <i>Grade: B+</i>

7. <b>Looks</b>: Ok, I'm 25, male and single and I have a Corolla. That's definitely not your typical Corolla driver. Its advertised as a family car and looks like one too. The dull grey interior upholstery really needs some improvements since it makes the car look old. Looking with a critical eye at this car, it's amazing the little things that have gone towards remodelling the Corolla but yet, put it next to a 1984 version and unlike most other car models, the 2 Corollas are remarkable similar. <i>Grade: B</i>

<b>Overall</b>: As my first new car, perhaps I expected more, but the Handling issues are what have soured my mind somewhat. However, one of the reasons for buying the Corolla was that my cousin has an 89 Corolla with over 260,000 miles and his only problems were with the timing belts. The engine still is chugging along nicely. For that reason probably, it does have a nice re-sale value so I'm not complaining too much. I would recommend the Corolla as a reliable family sedan that can be used for years without major problems. However, if you're just looking to lease a car for a couple years (or buy one for a couple years and then selling), I think you may not get what you deserve. There's better rides out there with more horsepower and easier handling for a similar price. <i>Grade: C+</i>

Next year I'll buy a Prelude.<br><br>
