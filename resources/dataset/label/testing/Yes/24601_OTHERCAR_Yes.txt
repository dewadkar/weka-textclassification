            I own a 2000 Mustang that I bought about four months ago.  After driving it it in a rainstorm, and scaring the CRAPOLA out of myself, I decided I needed something front wheel drive to have for the rain, and when winter gets here.  I looked at several &quot;economy&quot; cars, including Geo Metros, Honda Civics, and Chevy Cavaliers, but to me, they all felt TOO economical.  I knew I wanted something that I could tolerate drving for three months a year, and these cars weren't cutting it at all.  I went to a dealer and was actually looking at a 93 Probe as a possibility, but it didn't run, but next to it was my Tercel.

  At first, I wasn't very interested, because I thought the color was just awful.  Kind of a light greenish-blue.  After taking it for a test drive, though, I was impressed.  I'm not going to say it has power or handling to match my Mustang, but for a 93 HP 4 cylinder engine, it definitely has some pickup.  The 4 speed transmission shifts very smoothly, and quickly.  The vinyl seats, although they have a few small tears, are more comfortable than the ones in my Mustang.  I've actually found myself driving the Tercel on sunny days when I have no need to drive it, just because I kind of like it.

  My only complaints are that when you're sitting in the car and talk, it echoes, which gets a little bit annoying after a few minutes, and Toyota could have made it with power steering.  Economy car yes, but thats skimping more than necessary, in my opinion. 

 I would highly recommend this car to someone like myself who has a rear wheel drive car, and is young, so they can't afford to buy a 4x4 for the winter, or for someone who just wants a no frills car that runs excellently.  Mine has 122,000 miles on it, and doesn't make a sound that is out of the ordinary for an engine.  I wouldn't recommend the car to taller people.  I'm 6'2&quot; and my leg always hits the door, which gets uncomfortable after ten minutes.<br><br>
