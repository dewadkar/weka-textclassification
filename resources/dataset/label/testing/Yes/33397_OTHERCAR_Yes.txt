            This is my first Volkswagon and I can assure you it won't be my last! This is truly the greatest auto that I have ever owned. It is a solid built car that handles like a dream. Instrumentation is easy to read, having the side air bags is a comforting thought and the discount from my insurance is a nice plus. I find that the little extras in the car are what I find most fun, the outlet in the trunk to plug is a cell phone or whatever is very convenient, the daytime running lights, the keyless entry for the doors and trunk (including a panic button), and last but not least the doors that lock when the car goes into drive. I could go on raving about this car all day!!!!!!!<br><br>
