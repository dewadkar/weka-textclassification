            <b>Honda Civic</b>

<b>What is Nice About This Car</b>
I live in a very hill covered environment.  The Honda Civic is built relatively low to the ground.  What I like most about driving this vehicle is the fact that it takes turns really well.  Its a smooth ride and its low center of gravity gives the car the ability to take turns smoothly.

The interior is nice.  The seats are comfortable.  I wouldn't call this luxury but applicable for the price of the vehicle.  The 4 door allows for a roomy back seats.  Though the vehicle allows 3 in the back, this car supplies 2 people with adequate back seat space. 

I would describe the car as roomy but compact.  The truck space is a perfect example of this.  The truck allows for a decent amount of room but I wouldn't expect to be carrying wide loads of luggage with this vehicle.

The speed in which the car travels on the high ways is good.  I often find myself traveling at a higher speed then I anticipated. 

<b>What I Dislike About This Car</b>

The car doesn't approach hills very well.  The car seems to really slow down when it reaches large hills.  Other then hills the car seems to travel fine.  Its the large hills that supply the car with downfalls.

The stereo system that the car comes with is average to good.  You have the option to buy a CD player with the vehicle but I wasn't fortunate enough to have one with this car.  If you are a lover of music the factory system the car comes with we be less adequate for you.  If your not worried about music in your car then the stereo does a decent job.  I notice that I cant pick up radio stations as well with this cars stereo system as opposed to others.


<b>In Conclusion</b>

The car drives smooth around turns and on the high ways.  Going up hills is a different story.  The cars appearance isn't going to give you a show car feel but its not a bad looking car inside and out.  The car has a low center of gravity which makes for a smooth ride.  The trunk space is decent in size but wont be enough to haul around big family loads.  The inside is roomy and fits a family of 4 very comfortably.  <br><br>
