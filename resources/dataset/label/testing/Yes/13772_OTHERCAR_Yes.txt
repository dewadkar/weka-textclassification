            Purchasing a pickup truck in my industry is not a choice, but rather a necessity.  In the home remodeling industry, performance, durability and payload always come first and foremost.  After test driving several other manufacturer's products, I selected the Dodge Ram because of the crew cab space versus the cost of the vehicle.  The extended cab portion allows my workers to sit up straight and be comfortable at the same time, since travel to the job site can some times be tedious.  

I have found that the power of the standard V-8 engine is more than adequate while hauling heavy construction materials in the truck bed, or even towing an average sized trailer.  The suspension on the open road compares to that of an average full sized passenger car, giving you a very smooth and comfortable ride.  Compared to other pickup trucks with a comparable engine, I feel you get more miles per gallon on the open road and approximately the same miles per gallon in the city as the others.

One of the major advantages that the Ram 1500 has over the other trucks is the fold down storage compartment built into the middle of the front seat.  The storage space allows me to store my laptop computer and several other items which I use administratively on the job site.  When the storage compartment is closed, I use it as a desk top.

The only shortcoming that I have found with the vehicle is the speed control device.  Whenever I drive long distances on the interstate, I always like to set my speed control so that I don't have to continually worry about speeding.  With this truck it is a problem since the ride is so smooth that before you know it you can well be exceeding the speed limit.  However, the speed control has a tendency to drift downwards instead of maintaining a standard speed over long distances.  The problem seems to be more prominent on hilly terrain versus the level road surfaces.

Based on my experience, I don't feel that there is a better, more reliable truck on the road today for your money.<br><br>
