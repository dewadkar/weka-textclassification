            I have owned 3 Grand Cherokees, and currently have two in the &quot;Fleet&quot;. I live in upstate New York, and drive 50,000 miles a year on business and pleasure. In the past 2.5 years I have Driven The ZJ's 117,000 miles. The only breakdown was a seam leak in the radiator of my 95 Larado. This is the only failure I have exprieranced other than routine maintenance. 

I have had two of the 4.0L inline &quot;6's&quot;, and one 5.2L V-8. As nice as the power is in the V-8, I think it's overkill for this vehicle. There is more maintenance with the V-8, only 5 quarts of oil capacity vs. 6.5 quarts in the six. I feel the 4.0L is a better overall motor, requiring less maintenance, and will run forever as long as a proper maintenance schedule is followed. The six is a little buzzy at higher RPM, but it makes very usable power over the entire RPM range. I have towed with both the six and the V-8. Once again the six has plenty of power (5,000 lb capacity) to tow most items. If you need the extra power, the V-8 is very capable with bigger campers and boats.

If fuel economy is a factor to you, get the 4.0L six. In proper tune you can expect up to 25MPG. I have done a few things to my ZJ's to increase fuel economy. To maximize your performance and fuel economy increase the amount of air in/out of the vehicle and the spark. E-mail me for a more detailed list.

I find the ZJ's to be very comfortable. A few of the ergonomic problems have been addressed in the newer(99-00)models. I travel extensively with no driver fatigue or leg fatigue. 

And best of all, ZJ's are aminals off road! Grand Cherokees give you the best bang for your buck of all mid-sized SUV's. If I didn't like them, I wouldn't keep buying them. Also, I always buy them 2 years old with under 40K. With proper maintenance, over 200K miles is not out of the question for these vehicles. When I sold my 95 Larado to my sister(115K miles),she thought it was a better vehicle than her husbands 97 Blazer with 45K. After driving the Larado, so did her husband!I own 2 1996 ZJ Limiteds, one with the 6 and one with the 8.
