            I wanted to buy a new camera as I am heading into my travel season.  I called my father to ask his opinion as he has worked as a photographer.  I told him I was considering the Cannon Rebel 2000, as it has many features that are fully automatic.  He pointed out the obvious to me.  He asked me how many rolls of undeveloped film did I have lying around and when was the last time I truly looked at the 100's of photos I already have.  I was told to consider digital.  Instant gratification!!  I don't know why I hadn't thought of it. I am such a fan of gadgets!  I started to research.  I learned from my error with my camcorder, zoom was important to me.  This bad boy has an amazing 14X zoom.  That was the first thing that attracted me to it.  Then there is the 60 second motion+sound capability.  I can't tell you how much fun it is!  Just point and shoot.  The best feature is the recording media is a regular floppy disk that will run on any windows 95 or higher.  There is no cords or cables to hook up.  The choice of view finder VS. LCD screen is also an amazing bonus.  I had difficulty taking photos with my sister's digital camera because I kept putting it up to my eye like a conventional camera.  This camera gives you the choice.  You do need to read the manuals.  It is not the kind of camera you can quess how it works.  I had trouble with my pictures being too dark until I read how to adjust the brightness and white balance.  Although there were things I had to look up, and I still am a novice, the camera is easy enough to just point and shoot in well lit places if you just want basic pic's.  No more drop off+pick up development.  I can send photo's to anyone with a home computer.  I can print them. I can enlarge/reduce them.  There are just too many features to talk about them all...
Synopsis:  I had to learn how to use it.  It can do anything.  It is instant and easy to share.  It is the best camera I have ever had!<br><br>
