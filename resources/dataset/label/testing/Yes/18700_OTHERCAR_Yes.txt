            This is simply one of the best cameras on the market. The C2000s few annoyances are dwarfed by the quality of construction, ease of use and breathtaking results. The quality, clarity, sharp, and excellent color with or without a flash, is simply amazing. Not only is this a compact camera, but it is lightweight, and not to forget the excellent customer service. It feels like a good old 35mm, not like an e-consumer gadget. A lens cap is included, but it 'pops off just by looking at it', so attach it by poking a small hole with a knife and tethering it. An ill-designed power button is too close and too similar to the shutter button leading to frequent frustration. Some people's cameras viewfinder image turns out 5-10 degrees counterclockwise, so make sure you don't purchase a lemon. The user interface is a little clumsy; you have to go through two menus to get to the flash options. But overall this camera can do the job and thensome.<br><br>
