            My Mom owns a 2001 Toyota Camry. She also owned a 99, and a 94. Toyota makes one of the most reliable cars on the road, exceeded only by Honda. I took a rocket launcher and shot at the engine one day, and the engine was fine (really). 

About the car we have:
This is a semi-spacious 5 seater car. We bought one with leather, a moonroof, and 15&quot; rims. It is a four cylinder, and has a total of 2 horsepower more than the 99s (wow). It has an automatic transmission, and JBL stereo system. 

Pros:
These cars ride well for a family car. It is by no means a sports car, especially in the lower gears, but the gas mileage makes up for it. Above 60mph, these cars have great getup, and can accelerate very well on the interstate. Once again, these cars are very, very reliable, and have no problems at all. The back seat is spacious enough for a 5'10&quot; person such as myself to ride in. The leather seats are very soft and comfortable. Acceleration is smooth, as is the transmission. The JBL system is well worth the extra money as it is very loud with good range. So far the berlwood trim has been good, but on the 99 Camry we previously owned the berlwood started getting discolored very quickly. I believe that this car would be great for any number of purposes business or family. My Mom uses it as a real estate car, and also as a little truck because we lay down the back seats and carry most everything in it. The speedometer and other gauges are very easy to read, and the odometer is digital which gets annoying sometimes when you're wanting to change the trip odometer or check the mileage without the keys turned. The cupholders are in a great position, and the car has a number of little compartments in it. One other great thing is that in the 99 and up models, the rear ashtray was converted into a cupholder. The front headlights are improved over the previous model years, they are exceptionally bright. The moonroof is a great option.

Cons:
The brakes in every Camry I've driven are bad (I've driven 5). Most of the option packages are overpriced, especially the leather package which didn't even come with a leather steering wheel. The springs on the Camrys are cheap, and the car leans too much into turns. The scariest part about Camrys is how easily the body panels get damaged. Our last Camry was in a total of two fender benders. The first one was when we backed up into a post, at less than 10 mph, and the whole panel was bent in badly. The body shop guys had a hard time repairing it. The second one was another bender at less than 10 when some guy accidentally bumped into the bumper but it caused a &quot;dimple&quot; on the bumper in the corner. If the panels crush so easily at low speeds, I wonder what would happen at higher speeds? 

Overall the 2001 Toyota Camry is a great car, especially for family or business purposes. I would definitely suggest this car to someone.
