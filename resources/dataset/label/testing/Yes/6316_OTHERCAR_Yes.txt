            When I saw the dodge avenger for the first time i was shocked. I just fell in love with the way that it looked. I love that sporty look and then the way that dodge added style to it with low profile tires and good looking factory rims. Well about a week later my friend bought one. It was a 96 silver avenger es. He bought it used and from the records the previous owner kept it did not need a lot of attention under the hood. This car was very affordable and economical. Its great on gas milage and you dont have to be rich to own one. If you are shopping for a new car I would highly recommend that you check out an avenger and see what you think.<br><br>
