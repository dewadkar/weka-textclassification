            When I got pregnant I sold my cavalier and leased a Malibu. It sure seemed like it was big then. I love the ride, it is very smooth and not choppy at all. The ceilings are much taller and gave my husband (6'3) a lot of room. When I finally had my son the infant car seat worked fine in the back . We had a lot of room except for when we had a back seat passenger. Then when I bought a bigger carseat it was almost impossible to get it into the backseat. The car seemed so much smaller.
We also went on a vacation this summer and took our car. Boy we had it packed and it was not comfortable. That is when we realized this was not a family car. It is great for couples with no children or singles, but not families. There is just not enough  room for everything. I did however  love it because of the price and the accessories. <br><br>
