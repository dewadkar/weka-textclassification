            We have a 1996 Dodge Caravan and we love it!! It has 101,000 miles on it (that should tell you just how much we love our mini-van).  We purchased a Dodge product because we had been treated great by the manufacturer with our other two Chrysler products--a Dodge Dakota and a Plymouth Acclaim.  

With three children we love the extra room the mini-van affords us and on trips everyone can sit comfortably and we still have room for luggage and the ice chest.  I drove from Maryland to Arizona by myself with my three kids and other than a flat tire had absolutely no problems.  My car has been in the shop once for an oil leak, which was caused by a road hazard, a water pump that had to be replaced at 90,000(normal wear and tear) and  routine maintenance (belts, tune-ups, etc).  We have been very happy with our vehicle and will, when the time comes, purchase another Chrysler product.

The only other problem we've had was with the air conditioner (an essential piece of equipment in the desert) and that was a simple leak. We had some minor problems with the electrical system right after we purchased the vehicle, but as expected, the dealer fixed these without any hassles and got us into a rental car while the vehicle was being repaired.

My first new car was from another manufacturer who treated me like dirt.  The car was terrible and had numerous problems that cost a lot in time and money to get repaired.  Chrysler has been a dream to work with as far when problems arise.  The cars are well-built, can withstand rough conditions and last and last and last.  <br><br>
