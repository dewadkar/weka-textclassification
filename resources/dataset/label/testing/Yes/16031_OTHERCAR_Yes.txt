            I bought the Toyota Camry, I now have, 6 years ago.  It is the greatest.  The only thing I have had to do with it thus far is wash it, wax it, grease it, and change the oil and tires. It is the best car I have ever owned.  I now have 129,000 miles on it and it is still going strong.  I am thinking about trading it in on a new one only because I am just ready for a new car.  I just wish everyone knew how great the Toyota Camry is.  I bought one for my son, one for each of my daughters and now my husband owns one, so we definitely are a Toyota family. 

I have a friend that has a very old Toyota and I mean the body is old and worn out, but the engine is still going strong.  It is like you cannot wear out a Toyota.

I recommend a Toyota Camry very highly.  I love the sun roof on mine.  In the summer time, I can get sun-tanned while traveling down the highway.  It is neat.  I wear my sun dress and open the sun roof.  It is great.  Everyone wanted to know how I got such a good tan so soon.  Nothing like driving down the highway with the sun shining through.  I love it at night, too. I can look at the stars and the moon while driving along.  I love my Toyota Camry and I'm looking for a new one. Why buy a different car when you own the best.  <br><br>
