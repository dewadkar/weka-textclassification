            Ok, so I'll be the first to admit, I love powerful sports cars -- Especially the now extinct Japanese elite like the revered Supra RZ and the magnificent RX7 with that moster rotary engine.  yes folks, the Japanese have certainly taken the fun out of driving, at least in the united states -- Though at least the new "Z" is back, so it's a step in the right direction...  It seems like every new auto out of Japan is even more practical and less exciting, with the exception of a very limited few.  The Subaru WRX is most certainly at the top of this list and be assured, Subaru is putting the fun back into driving Japanese cars...

Since way before Paul Hogan starting advocating Subaru's AWD technology, the company was putting cars on the road with ever refined drivetrains and suspensions which were always well received by those willing to shy away from the dominant Japanese players like Toyota and Honda.  When I first began to read about a new Japanese turbo-toy with 14, YEAH FOURTEEN pounds of boost out of the factory with a functional hood scoop for chilling out a FACTORY installed intercooler!!!  wow?!?!?  I was pretty interested, to say the least!!!  By taking a rally-inspired and refined version of the already popular and successful IMPREZA, Subaru has absolutely upped the ante for high-performance Japanese engineered madness, and they've done it in a way NO other company has ever dreamed of doing it, THEY"VE PRICED IT FAR BELOW REASONABLE.  The WRX is truly an anomoly, and it reminds me of when Chevy first brought out the first new Impala's with the amazing LT1 engines found in Corvettes.  While a vette looked gorgeous and had tons of power, it also cost a ton.  The Impala was a modest looking but HIGE POWERED exciting sedan which was only priced at around 23,000 when they first came out, as opposed to over 43,000 for a vette.  The Subaru is out of the same mold - compare it to some of the other extinct Japanese semi-sports cars, like the imfamous Eclipse GSX turbo....Those guys cost you well over 28,000 way back when they existed....The Subaru is priced under 24,000 TODAY with tons of power and a great handling frame which will impress all you little turbo-mosters out there will the HOOK of all-wheel-drive and the stiff suspension and almost undetectable body roll while on those high-speed highway missions.  

Under the hood you find an almost diminutive horizontally opposed 4-banger, turbocharge AND intercooled which puts out just a few little horsepower under what a MUSTANG GT 8 CYLINDER does, 227 horsepower in the Subaru to be exact.  With almost 16 gallons of fuel in a full tank, ECM engine management and fully indpendent sport-tuned suspension, it is pretty obvious that this thing was rally-inspired.

I will only drive a manual transmission in a car like this - matter of fact I don't se the point of buying a car with this kind of power (yeah, FOURTEEN real pounds of boost) in an automatic.  Autos are great for the city, but can you really enjoy this car that much driving in the city?  Actually the answer is probably YES, because this car is COMPLETE FUN to drive....but having the 5 speed makes it worth it...slam this baby into first and feel that turbo kick just PULL once you reach over 3 grand...slam 'her into second and keeps those revs high and hang on TIGHT because you'll be amazed at how much power and hook this cars gets (perhaps not SO surprising in light of the fact that you have AWD and that tight rally suspension smoothly carrying horsepower right to the pavement.  I was very very impressed with the ample and agile steering on this car and how in-tune the AWD felt through tight high-speed turns.  There was NO understeer or oversteer - though I did feel that the Bucket seats left a bit to be desired when going into slalom mode...certainly for the tuning enthusiasts out there, a nice set of recaros might be in the mix once you begin to take the car to the next level.  

The WRX is an impressive little package and affords performance enthusiasts with a convenient way to get power and handling in a very reasonably priced package.  Without even considering the price, the WRX dogs the Audi A4 and when you DO consider that price, I think the comparison is almost unfair...I'll take the WRX any day.  16" allows come standard with 17"s as an option.  Save your money- go invest in a better intercooloer, exhaust and blow-off valve...yeah, for any of you who like gran-turismo, there are tons of aftermarket goodies to stick on this little SOB and 227 horsepower can quickly become aruond 310-330 without too much extra expense....Subaru has done miracles with a little 2 liter engine here - this is one special car

Make no mistake however, this car is all about FUN on a budget - it is capable of some serious stuff- did you know 0-60 on the WRX actually EXCEEDS that of a 1989 Ferrari- Speedvision advertised that in a clever trivia question - very impressive indeed, especially for 23 grand!  However My one concern is how long will this engine last with 14 pounds of boost out of the factory?  Knock wood, so far mine is doing quite ok, though it is mostly undriven with the arrival of my new Z...  Nevertheless, a VERY fun car to drive and a very very good value -- a remarkable FUN-to-DOLLAR ratio in my book, the WRX is for real!  Go test drive a WRX and experience how much fun Japanese cars have gotten once again...
