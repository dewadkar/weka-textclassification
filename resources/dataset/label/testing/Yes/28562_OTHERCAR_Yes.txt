            Sure the new Jeeps and SUVs out there are sexy, smooth riding and full of all kinds of extras, but when it comes down to 4 wheel drivability and toughness, nothing beats the old school CJ-7 and CJ-5.   Being 9 inches longer, which adds stability and the storage area behind the rear seat, I recommend the CJ-7 over the CJ-5 any day.   Regardless of the type of CJ, old school Jeeps are easier and cheaper to work on, last longer, and will get you where you need to go every time.

A friend of mine has a new Jeep.  Because he paid 22 thousand for it, he is too afraid to take it 4 wheeling.  Because of its delicate interior, CD Player and Air Conditioner, he never rides with the top off.    Besides being able to go anywhere, the main advantage of a Jeep is the Zen-like peace you get while driving with the doors off and the wind in your face.  It is like riding a motorcycle or driving a boat.  When your Jeep is worth 1/4 of what your house costs, you tend to be too scared to drive with the top and doors off....missing out on the best aspect of a Jeep.

In order to fix a new jeep, or any other new vehicle for that matter, you need a B.S. in electrical and mechanical engineering.  I can pull out any 2 or 3 wires or tubes going into my straight 6 at a time and the engine will still run.  Grab a &quot;Chiltons Manual,&quot; read a section once or twice, and you become a fully functional mechanic.    

Everyone who rides in my Jeep gets out with a smile on his or her face.  I recommend new Jeeps to high school girls.  I recommend old school Jeeps to anyone looking for a never-ending adventure.

Bottom line is that if you want to be able to run over anything... motorcyclists, tree stumps, boulders, parking blocks, or whatever...and if you want to not be afraid of having wind or rain in your face, the cash you saved by fixing your Jeep yourself in your pocket, and a smile on your face, buy an old school Jeep.
