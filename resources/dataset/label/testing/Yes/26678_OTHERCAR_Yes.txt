This is a truck that is becoming more and more watered down from it's roots of a durable, reliable and capable off-road truck. But the basis is still there. 

I bought my Disco as an all around vehicle - a four wheeled dirt bike, a dirt bike hauler and a trip taker. It's excelled at everything but the towing. While the tow capacity may be 5000lbs. that only means it will make that weight move - not fast or up a hill. Towing a 3000lb. trailer the truck wheezes up any incline and the speed drops until you're floored and the tranny has kicked down twice - if you're going to tow don't bother with this truck. The only thing less powerful than the engine would have to be the brakes. Why do you need ABS on a vehicle that can't look the wheels no matter how hard you step on the pedal? Oh yeah, slippery stuff. 

If you're going to commute or want the "safety" of 4WD than do everybody a favor and just get a Subaru or some other car. You don't need this. 

If you want to have a vehicle that can take you on back wood adventures or camping in far off places in Colorado or Utah than you can't do better. Nothing can beat this truck off road - nothing. I've driven 4WD's since I was 14 and I can take a sedan over a pass where most flat landers will high center a Jeep but this truck does things off road that I didn't think possible. On a trip with my fianc� in Moab we tackled Poison Spider Mesa by ourselves and there were sections where she would walk because she couldn't believe we could make it. Climbs so steep (45�) that you had to stick your head out the window and look down to see the horizon. With a different bumper and larger tires the truck was unstoppable. We pulled out 2 Jeeps, one Volvo (what was he thinking?) and a Toyota Land Cruiser between our forays on Colorado and Utah trails and never, ever once did we get stuck. It's impressive. 

At home in NYC I like the beefiness of the truck through all manner of potholes and poor roads and it's horrifically scratched paint from many tight trails lends an air of seriousness that seems to magically open the road as you work through traffic. 

Maintenance has been fair to good with over 105,000 miles. Head gaskets, and brakes (rotors not pads) being the big ones but that is more than likely due to making the truck work too hard with the trailer. Other than that the electric's are typically British which is to say awful. I've never seen so many little shorts and blow switches. If I had a dollar for every time a light or window didn't work I could pay for the repair. 

If you get one do yourself a favor and take an off roading school so you know what the thing can do and don't buy it for it's status - it's not worth it.
