            I recently purchased a used Tundra.  It was the SR5 version with the 4.7 V8.  The truck was everything I had read about. From the first time I drove it I realized the reason there is a difference in the price compared to the domestic version of full size trucks.

The truck was the most comfortable truck I have ever drove.  It is a full size truck that drives like a car.  The power delivered by the V8 was unbelievable.  

The interior of the truck has ample room for two adult passengers in the rear.  The controls are positioned perfectly for driver comfort and safety.  The passenger air bag can be disabled with the ignition key.  The console has storage room for everything you would want to put in it.  The cup holders hold travel mugs perfectly and are in the exact location you would want them, no reaching.  There are two cigarette lighter outputs for cell phone and another device.  

The truck drives great and handles great.  The transmission shifts smoothly and the engine is matched perfectly to the truck.  The oil gauge will alarm you at first.  When sitting at an idle the pressure drops down toward the low indicator.  I researched this on several car sights and found this the norm for the engine.  The design of the engine has low pressure at an idle.  Verify it for yourself at Edmonds.com.  

To summarize the Toyota Tundra is a great truck and will be sure to last along time.
