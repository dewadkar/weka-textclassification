            I find the maxima to be a very fun,economical,and sporty family sedan. The 95 maxima has 195 hp. which is plenty for this Japanese sedan. It has a bose stereo system that packs a wallop when you want it to. In addition to its stereo system it also has an easy to operate climate control system,radio, and controls, with an ergonomic design.It has ample trunk space and looks to die for. It comes in three different models the LE,XE,and ,SE. Although interior options range from leather seats to sunroofs they all have the same 195 hp. engine.Overall I find this car to be a dependable family car with with many luxurious options.<br><br>
