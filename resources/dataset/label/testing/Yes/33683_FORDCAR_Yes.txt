<TEXT>
            I recently purchased a 1998 Ford Escort SE (September 98). I went from a 1990 Volvo 740 Turbo that constantly broke down on me, to this now much loved Silver Bullet. The car has had slim to no problems, and has just been fun to drive. It's automatic...and came with a snazzy spoiler on the back. I would most definitely recommend this car to someone on a budget (like me) who wants a car that not only looks nice, but handles nicely, as well. <br><br>
