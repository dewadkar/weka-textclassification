            I cannot say enough positive things about this beautiful red 1994 4x4 stepside, extended cab K1500 Silverado. Wherever I go, people stop and admire it. With its tuneau topper and chrome side panels. Its an eye catcher. My husband and I pull a 5500 lb travel trailer easily with this truck, and have never had any problems. The bucket seats are easily adjustable and comfortable,and the center console has lots of storage space. While the back seat is not really good for long trips for adults, it works just fine for short drives. There are no cheap or flimsy features in the interior. I drive it to work and have no problem parking. (I'm 5'2&quot;). The Heartbeat of America Emblem on the back is truly fitting!
