            We bought our car because we were trying to get pregnant and wanted a car that would comply with the L.A.T.C.H. safety seats mandated to all vehicles by September 2002 (http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/childps/toptether/index.html).  The Passat was (and still is), one of the few cars that had this.  We bought ours in November of 2000.  Silver with black leather....VERY slick ;-).

Some of the things that my wife and I liked the best about this car was:
* V6 with good gas mileage
* L.A.T.C.H. system
* 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty
* Side safety curtain airbags (VERY COOL!)

One of the few things that I don't like is that you cannot get certain options, without getting something else.  It isn't as bad as it is for the Maxima (and option for option, this car ended up cheaper than the Maxima), but I wish you could add power seats and/or heated seats without having to add leather.  Another thing that bugs me is that you cannot adjust your stereo controls using the steering wheel unless the car is running.  One last thing is that the front quarter panel has a tendency to catch on drying cloths and clothes where it comes to a point near the hood.  Like I said, nothing major.

We ended up getting the GLX which came with the V6, leather, sunroof, and Monsoon sound system.  The sound system is nice, is is just lacking in low volume controls.  It goes from somewhat quiet, to off...would like a little more range.  It also has wood trim, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated washer fluid, and power everything...including seats...all standard.  When we compared a comparably equipped Maxima, it ended up being more, even though it starts out less.

We found that it is much better to get the GLX package, as opposed to adding stuff to the GLS V6 package, in terms as cost, plus, you couldn't get some of the options in the GLS that you can get in the GLX.  We also opted for the mudflaps (VERY GOOD IDEA...keeps crap from getting on your vehicle), wind deflector for the sunroof and cupholder in the center console (since the included cup holders can hold the giant cups of tea :).  I wish we had gotten the trunk mat, since I have already had a jug of washer fluid leak onto the carpet in the trunk.  At least the carpet comes out.

The last gripe that I have is that the optional first aid kit is in German.  C'mon...I understand that this is a German car, but I am not in Germany :).  All in all, this is a great car and I would easily buy it again.
