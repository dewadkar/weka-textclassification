            Many words have been written about this wonderful piece of German worksmanship. And it's only fair that most of those words are of praise. This is a truly great example of the cars Detroit should build but just does not... VW decided to go upscale with their cars but not necessarily with their prices. They know that the AUDI customer is always going to be in a whole different category so they moved VW up a notch into empty space between the top of the line (AUDI) and what used to be the "People's car" (VW). And what a great idea that was...

Most of my comments below apply to all the models. Some to the V6, 4motion, wagon I reviewed. So use accordingly.

<B>PROS:</B>

First and foremost this is a finely built automobile. It is rock solid with no funny gaps, no rattles, solid doors and insulation. It is impossible not to compare it to the AUDI and it is very close in craftsmanship. A real treat. 

Associated with the quality mentioned above are the material choices. The plastics feel good to the touch and do not look cheap. The wood trims look like real wood. The leather is spectacular. Great stuff indeed.

Now that we covered how well they built this thing let's look at the design.

The Wagon I reviewed was very, very spacious. Something inbetween an A4 wagon and an A6 wagon. And about the same size as the Subaru wagon. You can easily take two kids, and all the stuff that comes with them, cross country. If the kids can handle it... I especially liked the fact that the 4 motion (4WD) wagon did not lose much interior space due to the rear differential. Good packaging.

The triptronic gear box works very well. It is your choice to use it as full auto or manual. And the manual mode is pretty smooth and works well. Not the case with other cars...

This car looks good. It looks very upscale and well appointed. It is original without being too far from the classic european look. Good stuff.

Finally one of the major points that impresses me is that VW is backing it up with a 4 year "big car" warranty. They really are getting the Passat a new pedigree...

The V6 is smooth and meaty. I liked it very very much.

In summary an AUDI wannabee that does the part well. You can get a loaded 4 motion V6 Passat wagon fro 10 grand less than a comparable A6 wagon. It's a fair deal. And you will get a fantastic car.

<B>CONS:</B>

As much as being an AUDI wannabee helps the Passat it also deters from it. This car has not found its personality. "Am I the blue collar Passat of yore? Or am I the white collar city car of the future?" 

The car was made to look almost a little too upscale. With lots of silver lining... It works for some and not for others. It borders on "nouveaux rich". It's a double edged sword but a very subjective issue.

The handling is where this car falls short. Drive an A4 and your jaw will drop. The Passat is a larger more boat like car. Just like a VW should be. I guess they wanted it to be more AUDI like, but not quite an AUDI. Fair enough.

<B>RELIABILITY:</B>

New car. But the previous iteration (basically the same car) has faired pretty good. And now you have the 4 year warranty. Cant go wrong with that.

<B>CONCLUSIONS:</B>

A truly remarkable car. It is pretty darn near perfect for the price. Although price ranges from $24K to $32K you will always get a good deal. The same can not be said for other German cars.

I suggest you take a long hard look at this car. You may save a few bucks driving a Japanese sedan... But this car has a lot more soul and style for a little more money.

And the resale value should be pretty high.

Buy it! (if you can find one!)
