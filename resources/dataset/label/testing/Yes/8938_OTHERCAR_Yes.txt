            When we found out that we were going to have number two, we decided that the car we had just bought 7 months earlier was too small. We shopped around, and it came down to two minivans, the Ford Windstar and the Dodge Caravan. When we looked a price and options, we thought Dodge had the most to offer. So we bought one. And I think it was the BEST thing we could do (other than have two wonderful kids... :o) ). When I talk to a friend that bought the Ford, she tells me she wishes that she would have bought one too.  

With living in Wisconsin I was worried about how it would handle in the snow. I had heard some things that concerned me. But when the first snow fell.....I was surprised, it handled like a dream. So I'm sure you can guess what it is like to drive in regular conditions. One of the best features is the spare tire is hidden underneath the car. It's not what you think, you don't have to crawl under and get dirty to get it, you just lift the flap in the trunk and put your lug wrench in it and lower it to the ground. Then you you put it on.  <br><br>
