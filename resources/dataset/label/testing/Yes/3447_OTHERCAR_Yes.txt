            I've owned this car for just over three months now, and overall am very pleased with the decision. Other cars on my short list included the BMW 3 series, the VW Passat V6 and the 2002 Nissan Altima; I chose the CL because it was a solid performer with rock-solid reliability and an excellent value.  

The CL-S had placed in the top two in every magazine comparison I could find for cars in its class, and my test drive experience bore this out: the car's performance envelope was well beyond anything I was bound to use on civilian roads.  The Vehicular Stability Assist (VSA) proved to be an ideal compromise between letting you have fun and keeping you out of trouble, and the seats, which might be snug for those with large torsos, were very supportive through the twisties, yet have proven comfortable on long trips.

The engine pulls like a freight train, once you understand how to get the power out of it. Iï¿½d suggest the following transmission settings: D4 to get maximum power out of the engine around town, D5 for cruising on the highway, and SportShift on the twisties. 

The long list of standard equipment was the main reason I chose the CL over the Accord V6 Coupe, which shares the same platform as this car, but can't be optioned up with some of the things that come standard on the CL, like Xenon headlamps, seat warmers and auto-dimming rear-view mirror.  I skipped the navigation system, because after test driving both, it seemed the ergonomics of the standard CL-S were superior.

The styling is clean and contemporary, which some people think is bland, but I think makes the car less of a ticket magnet. I like the perforated leather upholstery, the seat heaters, the automatic climate control and the auto-dimming rear view mirror in particular.  The six-disc CD changer is very nice, though I ended up scrapping the Bose speakers and amp in favor of some Boston Acoustics speakers, a sub and Sony Amps (you can do this with an adapter available from AudioLink).

Gripes: Other than the "blose" speakers mentioned above, the car has some annoying detail problems unbecoming a $30K car.  Two in particular come to mind: the sunroof has a resonance/rattle which is bad enough for me to drive around with the sunshade closed, and my drivers-side seat has a tendency to squeak like a cheap motel bed in corners. Both of these are going to get dealer attention until fixed. A minor gripe is that the bumper "fog lights" are actually "marker lights" that don't match the hue of the HID headlamps, but swapping the factory bulbs with PIAA 91224s corrects this.

The Acura TL is available in Type S trim for model year 2002, and it offers the same tweaks as the CL-S, plus two nice extras: a subwoofer mounted in the trunk (to fix the bass problem many people have cited in the CL) and real fog lights in the bumper. Both the CL-S and TL-S models in 2002 have mildly restyled wheels which bring outer edge of the rim inside the outer wall of the tires, making the rims less susceptible to scratches.  

Overall, the CL-S is a wonderful car that would give anyone years of enjoyment.  For those of you wanting a manual transmission, supposedly one is in the works for late this model year or early next.  With this, and a few other tweaks to the engine to unlock some of the power hidden within, I'm sure this car will maintain its place in the firmament for some time to come.
