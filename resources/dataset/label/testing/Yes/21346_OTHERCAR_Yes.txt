            I got into an accident and smashed up one of our cars, and had a rental car for 3 weeks during repairs.  The rental was a 1999 Toyota Camry.  I made a face when the agent told me, thinking &quot;cramped little car.&quot; I was 6 months pregnant at the time and feeling a need for space. I was pleasantly surprised when she took me over to a good size &quot;mid-sized&quot; car.  I was even more surprised when I drove the car over the next 3 weeks.  It handled beautifully, like a sports car on corners and parking in tight spaces.  It had great pick-up on the highway, so much I thought it was a 6 cylinder engine, which I later found out it was not.  It had more than enough leg room both in the front and back seats, and a very generous trunk.  And it didn't look like a Toyota, or at least what I thought of when I pictured a Camry.  I fell in love.  Six months and one child later it was time for my husband and myself to go new car shopping.  He thought we needed more of a family sized vehicle.  So we looked at Jeeps.  We looked at vans.  We looked at station wagons.  I kept mentioning how much I loved the Camry, finally convinced him I wouldn't be happy until he at least looked at one.  To make a long story short, he fell in love, too.  We bought our Camry 8 months ago and we are still in love with it.  It has great pick-up for a 4 cylinder engine, which means it also gets great gas mileage.  It is a 4 door so getting the baby in &amp; out is convenient,yet there is plenty of space for our older children to stretch out their legs.  So far the only problem we have had is the automatic door locks sticking, it has been back to the dealer for nothing else so far- not one rattle or annoying squeak that you usually get with a new car.  Its a lot easier to park (and back up in!) than my friends mini vans, and I feel like I'm driving a fun car rather than a boring sedan.  <br><br>
