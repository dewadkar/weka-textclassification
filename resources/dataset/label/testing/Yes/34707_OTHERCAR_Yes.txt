            I looked, and looked, and looked for a family car. Camrys? Not gonna pay $20,000. Accord? Too ugly! Sonata? Hmmm, this could be it! I bought the Sonata (1998, wish they had something on it) because of the price, styling, and power. The Sonata's rock-bottom $15,000 base is an excellent price for a lot of car. My car totaled up to $16,242, with options like automatic transmission, carpeted floor mats, and a whole lot more. The styling of the front is amazing, the best I've ever seen. The design of the curves going up from the fascia into the hood was what really got me. The back looks as if it has a V-6 under the hood(mine is a 4-cyl), due to the dual chrome tailpipes. The car also looks as if it sits lower, too. The power is also more than the competitiors (125 for Camry, 135 for Accord, and 137 for the Sonata). Although for the year 2000, the 4-cyl outpowers the competitors, the V-6 surely does not(194 for Camry, 200 for Accord, 170 for Sonata). Back to the 1998 model year, i think the thing that I most love about it is the fabric on the seats, and the stereo(great sound, Hyundai!). I hate the dim low-beam headlights the most. You can leave your high-beams on and no one will care. Hyundai, please make them brighter! I think the people who are most suited for this car are: four member families, doctors, lawyers, and elderly folks. Contractors fit into the class that shouldn't buy this car(no offense guys!). Pick a Sonata!<br><br>
