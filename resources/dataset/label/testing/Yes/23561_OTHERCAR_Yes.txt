            I purchased a Chevy Z71 extended cab truck a month before I graduated from college, and being my first car purchase, I spared no expense. Leather, CD, towing package, third door, the works. I can honestly say that I am as proud of my truck now as I was the day I bought it.

When trying to decide on my initial purchase, I truly loved the fact that the Z71 was a real truck with solid design lines and a lot of capability. Its looks alone demand a lot of respect, and once I test drove one, nothing else really compared. 

In a little under three years of heavy driving, I have had one single incident to report--a faulty battery. No problems with the electrical or computer systems, no problems with drivetrain or engine, no problems with four-wheel drive system (which I have made extensive use of).

The 4.3 L V8 has been a workhorse, obviously not wonderful in terms of fuel consumption, but a smooth and powerful piece of machinery. Highway acceleration is excellent, and the drop in gears to accomplish highway passing has never been a jolting experience. Gas mileage proved to be most efficient in highway driving, when the big V8 was not exposed to lots of stop and go driving.

Being 6'5&quot; tall, head and legroom is of utmost importance. Headroom is good, but would be much more accommodating with at least one or two more inches. Legroom is wonderful, and can easily accommodate the tallest driver.

The third door is wonderful, but the back seat is better suited for luggage than for passengers. Any unlucky passenger who is seated behind a tall driver (like myself) is in for a cramped ride. This is something that Chevy addressed in the 2000 models. However, if not many back seat passengers are anticipated for an owner, it makes an excellent space for cargo or luggage.

The '98 Z71 is a solid truck that has characteristics that an owner will either love or hate. Being specifically an off-road model, the suspension is noticeably stiffer than a car driver would expect. The Bilstein gas shocks are excellent for off-road handling, but can be somewhat jolting driving long distances over semi-rough roads. However, this is a characteristic that I quickly became accustomed to, and personally added to my love of the truck as a real SUV and not a minivan with big tires.

The truck has a relatively wide turning radius, so this can be troublesome in tight parking or turning situations.

The four-wheel drive assembly worked flawlessly (manual lever on my truck) through a lot of use. I have driven through some rough areas without a hint of a pause.

In summary, the '98 Z71 is a truck for an individual who appreciates the ruggedness and capability of a true off-road truck. Reliability has been excellent, and I would not hesitate to buy another.<br><br>
