            We bought our Jeep Grand Cherokee in July before two of the worst winters
here - 1992-3 and 1993-4.  And boy, were we glad we did!  It handled 
wonderfully in the snow.  In March, 1993, we got 28 inches of snow from 
one storm.  We were living in a place with no parking, so we had to
park on the street where the snowplows kept piling up the snow around
our car.  I was able to drive up and over the mounds of snow with little
problem.  I love it!  The car is now 6 1/2 years old, just hit 100,000 mi
and we've had one major problem (that was covered by the warranty).  The
only negatives are the low gas mileage and the backseats have no headrests.<br><br>
