             I have owned 3 suvs.  Jeep Cherokee, Chevy Blazer and now Dodge Durango.  The Durango surpasses both by far in the style, room, and convenience categories.  I have the third seat option which is key for me.  This third seat folds all the way down so you don't know it is there when it's not in use.  Kids love the cupholders and cubbyholes everywhere.  I Cart around 4 kids 2 adults, and many times bikes.  Everyone is comfortable and plenty of room so kids don't completely torture each other or me.  Off road, on the beach it drives like a dream and turning four wheel drive on and off is easy.  I absolutely love the car!  I travel 50 miles a day to and from work and this car is thirsty.   Gas mileage is the only drawback.  Go to a five-star Dodge Dealership.  They treat you right.<br><br>
