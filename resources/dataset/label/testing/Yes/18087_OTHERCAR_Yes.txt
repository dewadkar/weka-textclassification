            We bought a 96 Neon in 1996.  It was a great little college car that was reliable and fuel efficient!  Now 4 years and 130,000 miles later the car is still running like a champ!  The only bad thing about it is that it gets extremely noisy when highway driving, but if you can handle turning your radio a little louder you will never notice.

I would definitely advise this vehicle to a college kid who needs to save money on gas (we get about 40 miles a gallon, which with todays prices is great!).  It takes about $15 to fill it up and that will last you 1-2 weeks (depending on how much you drive!).  I would not advise this car to someone who likes a very smooth ride or who has a problem bending down to get into the car (my mother-in-law hates driving in it).  But if you are looking for a very dependable cost efficient car... The Neon is for you!<br><br>
