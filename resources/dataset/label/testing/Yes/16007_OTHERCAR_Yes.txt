            Recently shopping for a family-size sedan, the 2001 Toyota Camry was near the top of the list. We also took a look at the Honda Accord, VW Passat, and Mazda 626.

This car is a fine choice, with all the comfort, reliability and performance (six-cylinder only) that you need.

The Camry is one of the more expensive choices (topped by the VW Passat only), but for that extra money, you get Toyota's stellar reliability record, and a very solid car. 

The best aspect of the Camry we test drove was the quietness of the ride. We drove a V-6, and it was smoooooth. A lovely ride that anyone would appreciate, with very little wind, engine and road noise. The engine is exceptionally quiet, it works hard for you without straining or struggling. 

Quietness and smoothness score huge points in my book. If I only cared about ride, this would be my car. But, the Camry doesn't do as well in other areas, including:

<b> Styling. </b> The car is bland. It is not a bad bland, but it by no means an exciting car. Forget it. A Toyota Camry is a functional, well-built, nice riding, quiet car, but it is not a pretty car. It is not a sporty car. It is a very modestly attractive car, and that's being nice. Frankly, I prefer the Camry styling of a few years ago, which had some class (the back end was more attractive). The new taillights may want to be sporty, but they're not even close.

In addition, the Camry paint selections leave something to be desired. If you do decide to buy a Camry, please do me a favor and DO NOT BUY A BEIGE ONE!! I am just sick and tired of all the beige Camrys out there. There are surely too many, and Toyota makes tons of beige cars. It's a shame. Please, go for an interesting color (or as interesting as you can get in a Camry). My recommendations would be the dark green, the red, perhaps black or silver. It's going to be hard to create some excitement with that Camry, but you really should try.

I love red cars, but the Camry red is dull and dark. Really, a few lively colors in the mix would really help those of us who like our cars to feel alive.

Ok. Back to the car. The Camry's interior is equally utilitarian. Instruments are well-placed and easy to read. Seats are comfortable. Styling is bland and functional. 

On the higher-end models you can get leather seats and neat options that try to jazz the Camry up, like two-tone paint. It's a nice try, these models do have a little more oomph.

Overall, the Camry is a really good car. I have no doubt that many Camry owners will get many, many happy trouble-free miles from their faithful vehicles. They'll love the quiet ride, they'll love the reliability and comfort. They'll blend in rather than stand out.

If I had been feeling a little more practical, mature and sedate I might have bought a Camry. (And in fact, there may be a Camry in my future someday), but I ended up choosing an Acura TL. A little nicer than the average family sedan, and that's exactly what I wanted.

Have fun car shopping! Go drive a Camry!
