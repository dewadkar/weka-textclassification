            I bought my 1991 Chevy S-10 Blazer back in the summer of 1994.  The 1991 model was the first to come out with four doors.  To make a long story short, besides my investment in Microsoft and Dell stock at the same time, this would have to rank as one of my best investments ever.  I have had only one minor problem.  The air conditioning fan went dead.  However, this can be attributed to the place where I live where you run the AC at all times in the summer and blow the heat all winter long.  I would highly recommend a Chevy Blazer.  It is stylish for a first car teen, yet dependable and reliable for the commute to work.  Go out and get a Chevy Blazer today. <br><br>
