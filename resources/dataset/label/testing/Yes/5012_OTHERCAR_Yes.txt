            THE DEAL
   A week ago yesterday, my partner's 1996 Plymouth Breeze started acting up, again.  Have bought the car in September, and sinking $2000 in it in February, I was sick of this money leeching car.  I demanded we buy a new car.  Well, he knowing not much about cars, and I knowing alot, I headed off to search the local lots.  I had been eyeing the Hyundai Elantra GT, but the dealer I had been working with was out, so I went to the dealer next door.  I was cruising the lot, checking out a 2001 Honda Civic, when the salesman showed me a silvery 2001 Nissan Sentra SE.  I was immediately impressed by the look of the car.  It had a spoiler, foglights, at 16" rims.  I was also happy it was a Nissan (I have a 1993 Altima with 152,000, runs perfect, which I bought at the same dealer).  So I took it for a test drive.  The salesman, Danny, had the A/C on, and the car had plenty of pickup, especially for an auto(mine's a stick).  A few things my partner was looking for was something smaller than his Breeze, and with more power.  Well this fit the bill.  I called him told him about the car, he said go ahead.  They appraised his Breeze at $1200(very reasonable) and the price they had on the Sentra was a tad over $13,000.  This particular dealer has the No Haggle policy...the Sentra actually books out at a tad under $15,000, so I knew it was a deal.

THE CAR
   The car itself is the Radium color, and has the performance package.  It has all the standard goodies, plus sunroof and wind deflector.  The interior is black, with an odd but yet not very obtrusive design on them.  SE owners will understand :).  I have read complaints of the use of "hard plastics" in the interior, but I find the tastefully done.  I love the layout, everything is easy to use.  As with most Nissans, the cupholders are blocking something, this time the climate control.  I like the look of the titanium face gauges and the layout of the speedo/tach.  We travel alot, (100 miles a day) and use the top cubby for napkins, and it works great.  The air works great, but we have not had a chance to use the heater.  The seats and a tad firm, but overall are comfortable. I am 6' tall, and find the interior space good, head room is excellent.  I did some research and discovered this car is the same size as my 1993 Altima.  We both LOVE the steering and handling of this car, and don't mind the little ride quality sacrificed. I am considering a Sentra SE, stick of course, when my Altima finally gives up.  Gas mileage has been good, about 27 mpg, considering we are still having fun hot rodding right now.  Another plus, is you don't see one everywhere, as you do with the Civic.

OVERALL
   I would definately recommend this car to people who need a super reliable car that's affordable, fun to drive, and gets decent gas mileage.  Get one with the performance package if you can, for added looks and handling!
