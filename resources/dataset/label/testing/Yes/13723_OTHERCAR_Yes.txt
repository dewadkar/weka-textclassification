            	Firstly, I preface this review by stating that I have a 1998 Mercedes-Benz C 280 sport sedan. HOWEVER, if I were given the chance (and I will probably do it soon), I would trade it in for a 1999 BMW 328i and the difference in price in a heartbeat.

	I had the pleasure of borrowing a friend's Beamer, and I was a bit surprised. I thought that, being less expensive than the C 280 it would be less of a car, but I was, for the most part, very wrong. Granted, the Benz has a more solid feel to it and smoother gear shifting, the BMW has almost exactly the same engine (a 2.8-Liter V6) and was very comparable in terms of speed and acceleration (the Benz was quicker off the start, but once the BMW gets into 3rd gear, you're really jetting). The interior, though, was a bit plusher. My only complaints are that the stereo system was not quite as good (although a high-end Bose system is an option), and the BMW had no cup-holder. Other than that, it was certainly a sportier car, with a sportier look.

	The handling in any BMW is just heavenly. The 328i is so quick and nimble, I felt very safely glued to the road, ensconced in the pilot's seat. I immediately took the car to a windy mountain road I know and it soared. There was very little sway around very tight corners at very high speeds and the engine was VERY happy to burn up some carbon at the high RPMs I was pushing out of the roughly 200-hp powertrain. Inside, however, the ride was quiet and smooth, although the suspension was a little harder than that in the Benz, but this was also why it swayed less on corners--and besides, I like to feel the road! I was not terribly worried about my personal safety, either, the BMW being armed with a whole slew of safety features, very similar to those found in the Mercedes-Benz. In terms of reliability, there is little better than a BMW--my friend has not had to take it into the shop yet, except for the standard check at 5,000 miles and a new set of clutch pads (he likes to DRIVE his cars)!

	All in all, the BMW 328i is a sporty, nimble, and gorgeous machine, one of the best toys for big kids (okay, and sophisticated adults, too!) you can buy for less than $30,000.<br><br>
