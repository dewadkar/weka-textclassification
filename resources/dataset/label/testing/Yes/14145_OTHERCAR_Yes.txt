            I bought camera from a friend at a price i could not turn down! I needed a good Digital camera but did not want to spend over $300.00. This little baby is just what I needed!

1.3 Megapixels,1,280 x 960 Image File size,2x Digital Telephoto, 1.6 inch LCD Monitor,USB Port cable,8 MB memory stick and software.

You can set camera at best resolution and take 12 pictures, medium resolution and get 20 and lowest resolution and get 47. The batteries last at least 200 pics! 4 AA batteries. Very easy to operate and is about the size of my wallet. The Automatic flash is nice.

I recommend this camera to the person just starting out in digitals, the price is right and the performance is outstanding. <br><br>
