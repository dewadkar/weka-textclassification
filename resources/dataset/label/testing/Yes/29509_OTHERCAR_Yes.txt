            A few months ago, my son and I were in a big electronics store and he showed me a digital camera.  He told me that this would make are regular film camera�s obsolete in the near future. I thought the camera was very interesting, but I was exactly going to go buy it.

A few weeks later, my son owned my some money for an appliance that I paid for when he moved into his new house.  Instead of giving me the money, he bought me the Kodak digital DC240 camera.  At that point, I decided to keep the camera and start getting into the 21st century.

The camera has many useful features,  I really like the fact that you can view all your picutures right after you take them on the 2 inch lcd display. Then, if I don�t like them, I delete them on the spot.   I have also found that if you leave the display on a long time it really puts a serious drain on the batteries.

The camera comes with and 8 Meg memory cards which is easy to insert. I am able to take 54 pictures at standard resolution (640 x 480, I think) before, I usually have to delete or export the pictures to my PC. The camera  also comes with 8 batteries, 4 our rechargeable with the included recharger. 

The Kodak Easy picture software is pretty easy to uses, but it does take a long time to down load.  My son said that I don�t have a USB connection and using the serial connection takes a lot longer.

It's still a great way to email pictures to your friends and family, especially if you don't own a scanner.

I would recommend this camera, but until you can print truly high quality, high gloss pictures that won�t cost you a forture, I see this technology still a few more years away from being in the mainstream.
