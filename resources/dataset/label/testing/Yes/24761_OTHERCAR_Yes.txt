            <b>Experience</b>
I bought this camera about 4 weeks ago from eBay. Since then I've used it to take about 300 shots from daylight to flash and have a good grasp of the controls and features already.

Previously I have only used point and click type cameras although I've been around semi-professional users all my life and understand the basics. 

<b>Why</b>
I wanted a another digital camera so I could keep taking heaps of shots and not worry about photo development costs. I wanted a strong optical zoom and more features too. I researched the camera quite well on the net before I bought it. Luckily there aren't too many digital cameras in my price range with that kind of zoom so the choice was easy. The camera does have its known issues but ultimately it was billed as a very satisfactory camera.

<b>Budget</b>
Budget was important to me when buying this camera.I wanted to spend less than US$400 all up. This included for the following items (all of which I believe are a necessity): 
* Memory card for at least 100 higher quality shots
* Fairly good soft case 
* Fast 12V/240V NIMH Charger and 
* 8X high capacity NIMH batteries

I live in Australia and the best price I could find here in a shop (or local eBay seller) was way too expensive for my budget so I got it from the US. So what I am reviewing here is the US model (Olympus C-720 UZ), made by Olympus America and new in the box (not refurbished).
<b>Choices</b>
The only other models that the reviews that I saw looked kindly on were:
* Fuji FinePix 302 (6X optical)
* Olympus C-740 or 750 (10X optical)
* HP Photosmart 10X zoom.
Why didn't I go the extra mile and get the C-740 or the C-750? The answer is budget. You can get the cameras for $100-$200 extra respectively which doesn't seem too much for that extra megapixel and a few more features but here's the catch. The C-720 uses the older Smartmedia memory technology. The C-740/750 use the newer proprietary Fuji/Olympus picture cards. These are about twice as much to buy per megabyte compared to the Smartmedia and also with the extra capacity of the cameras, I'd end up needing more megabytes of memory for the same number of pictures. This meant I would have to pay almost double for all the stuff I needed. The newer memory cards however do use less power, come in larger sizes and have faster read/write speeds. 

In my research I discovered the C-740/750 has the same  1/2.5" sized CCD (picture censor) as the C-720 as well as the same lens. When I looked at the example photos for the cameras, the shots for the C-740 were bigger but not that much better. So I made my choice - stick to what I can afford and leave much less room for disappointment. After getting all the necessary accessories etc. I was still well under my budget and I am very pleased with the camera.

<b>The Camera</b>
Fantastic level of control and ease of use. I got to know this camera pretty well within an hour or two. It will serve as an excellent introduction into better photographic techniques using  aperture / exposure controls as well as serve me well as a point and click camera for when I'm too busy having fun. You choose what settings you want to change and the camera will set the remaining ones. This is great for learning because say for example you have a particular shutter speed setting you want to use, you can see what aperture setting the camera will use to compensate.

Zoom function is fun to use and great for people / wildlife / action shots. Smooth and fast enough with little loss of picture quality (just be sure to have a steady hand on max zoom). Pity the minimum zoom is at 40mm but this can be overcome using the panorama function. 

Time to focus can be a little long at times, especially in low light. Manual focus option would have been nice. Shots look great under flash, minimal red-eye and good colors. LCD is a little small but well detailed. Same detail in the digital viewfinder but It looks fuzzier and a little choppy - again, especially under low light.

Pictures are good although a little fuzzy at 100%. At 8'x 11' they're just fine. Very nice on close ups and macro mode. Great color balance, especially in low light, not much noise (dotty complexion). I've seen better photos from the likes of the Canon G3/G5 (gorgeous) but they ain't got nearly the zoom!

Some of the chromatic aberration (purpling around the edges where really bright areas meet dark areas) mentioned in other reviews is evident in a few shots but fairly minimal. I'm sure once I learn to use the aperture/exposure settings better I'll be able to minimize them further. It has been said that this is a common problem to all digital cameras with big zooms so if you really want the zoom, you've just gotta live with it I guess. If worst comes to worst I can always Photoshop or other software to get the purple out.

Movie mode is just passable. There is a maximum of 16 seconds (no matter what memory card you have). There is no sound, and the quality ain't real great. It'll do but the movie mode on my old 1 megapixel cheapie is better. Anyway, that's not why I got the camera so I'm not really fussed. If I want movies, I'll buy a movie camera! The C-720 has a burst picture mode which fires about 2-3 shots/sec if your're worried about capturing the right moment. One shot per sec if the focus and aperture are re-assessed for each shot. 

All digitals have some shooting time lag. The lag on this camera is average. Not too good for say, catching a bird in flight at close range but ok for most sports or wildlife shooting.

<b>Final Word</b>
If you want the zoom and the features this is a great camera. If you want that AND you are on a budget this the perfect camera. Great "bang for ya buck" as they say. Pick one up while they're cheap and still new in the shops.
