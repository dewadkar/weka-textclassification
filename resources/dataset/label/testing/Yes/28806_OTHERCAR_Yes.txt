            We got this car last fall and love it.  We're only guilty of driving too fast.  The Chevy Lumina has a very smooth ride.  And it's very roomy for our three kids (ages ranging from 3-9).  Our kids love riding in it.

We have the Chevy Lumina LTZ which is loaded with accessories.  We have a sunroof, cd player and cruise control.  All for a reasonable price.  

Having a family of 5 this is truly a nice family car.  But also looks sporty enough to look "cool". It also has the great feature of child locks for the back doors.  So you can feel secure about not having the kids play with the doors. 

I truly recommend this car for the family person with a sporty taste.

In fact, we (my husband and I) fight on who gets to drive it.
