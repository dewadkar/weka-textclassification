               I have used the Coolpix 900 for a couple years.  This camera has functioned very well and the pictures have furnished the visual information necessary to add credibility to my work and make my job easier.  Recently I had the chance to use the Coolpix 950, for a day.  I thought initially that little had changed.  On the outside I was right, but the inside has changed.  the quality of the pictures in both improved resolution and recycling speed to the next picture, has me saving to purchase this model for personal use.  Additionally, the day after using the 950, I have requested funds at work to purchase it for use as the office's primary camera.

   People or companies that require HIGH quality, professional  have to project photos on large screens, or have requirements for fine details, plus do not have huge sums of cash, this camera provides professional quality.

   The ease of use and quality of the pictures was the best of any I have tried within the last months.  The feel of the camera in my hands also felt right most of the others did not even feel good.  The price on this camera is higher than most in this range of cameras.

   The wide angle adapter lens is quite a help in tight spaces and does not cause any noticeable distortion.  The memory flash card (furnished) is to small for my office's work needs and will necessitate an upgrade to 64MB.  A 64MB Viking Components CompactFlash (r) card (also borrowed) worked as soon as I turned the camera on and is an excellent value.<br><br>
