            This camera is Great!
Though under 1 MegaPixel, it still gives great looking pictures, even when printing with standard HP, Cannon, and Lexmark Printers.  And with a 14x fully Optical Zoom, this Camera is a Must have for any Photographer wanting to Digitalize his work.
Also, with Sony's 3.5&quot; Disk Drive, Pictures are easy to store on standard Floppy Disks, and Disks can be easily stored or taken with you.
Comes with a Lithium Ion Rechargable Battery and charging station so you don't have to spend a bundle on AA's.
The movable View finder is also a great addition to let you get those hard to reach shots.

Built in standard Tripod mounting screw, and works with all 1.44Mb Floppy Disks.

Carrying Case is also a must.

At $999 this camera's expensive, but worth every penny.<br><br>
