             I bought this van because i heard a lot of good things about them. Even though it had 207,000 miles on it when i bought it back in july 1999. everything was original but then the water pump and the timing belt broke it cost $266.00 to fix but it still runs more than 100% . I am a chrysler and chevrolet person and nothing can change my mind. I have had many autos and all fords where JUNK so where subarus ext. I love the way it handels and rides . As you can see since july i it went from 207,000 to 214,000 and it still runs great. and is in very great shape also some rust just starting. But not threw yet.The only two things I can say that i don't like is it smokes and very little storage (glove box ext.). The smoking hasn't done any harm so far i have been told that the all with the 3.0 v6 will smoke and to fix it it alittle pricey. And it won't do anything it's just the valve seals. 

    so i would very much highly recomend this van.  i have the 7 passenger and it is also very roomy in all seats i can just imagine if it was the grand voyager.<br><br>
