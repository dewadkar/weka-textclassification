            THIS REVIEW IS ON THE 2003 CLK

I've waited for this car all my life: Make enough money to buy an awesome car. I finally did it, reached that goal and was faced with a decision. What to get. (my price range was 40 - 70 thousand). After long deliberations, I zeroed in on CLK-320.

Why?

1. Its a Benz.
2. Looks Amazing:
   (I suggest go to MBUSA.com and look at some pictures, 360* exterior and interior views)

   - Redesigned Front       
   - Redesigned Back 
   - MOST IMPORTANTLY:
          No Bi-Pillar. What that is, is the bar that 
          separates the front seats from the back seats in 
          ALL coupes. The rear windows look extremely 
          small (like airplane windows). In the 2003 CLK 
          model, they rear windows look like actual windows
          and they actually open fully!!!! Find that in 
          your local coupe.

3. It has a very powerful engine, all of the CLKs do. I chose the 320 because I live in New York, and I drive on New York highways, mostly in traffic. So 5.0 (CLK 55AMG)seconds vs 7.0 seconds 0-60mph (CLK 320) means I will be 2 seconds faster to the next stopped car in bumper to bumper traffic for two hours.

Quick Engine specs:

<b>Engine </b>3,199-cc SOHC 18-valve 90� V-6. High-pressure die-cast alloy cylinder block, alloy heads. 
 
<b>Net power</b> 215 hp @ 5,700 rpm 
 
<b>Net torque</b> 229 lb-ft @ 3,000 - 4,600 rpm 
 
<b> Compression ratio </b> 10.0:1 

There are a lot of options that you can choose, I got the following:

<b> 951 Appearance Package
 K3 Package 
 K4 Package
 Heated Seats
 Command System
 6-CD Changer
</b>

1. 951 Appearance Package:
(this is what it looks like: http://mbusa.com/media/images/byo/popups/MY2003/CLK320C/pack_951.jpg )

. 17" 5-Spoke Alloy Wheels
     These are the AMG rims. 
� Performance Tires:
� (F) 225/45 ZR17; (R) 245/40 ZR17
       You should be very careful in the snow with them
� Enlarged Chrome Exhaust Finisher
� Patterned Aluminum Trim
� Sport Shift Knob w/Chrome Trim
� Rubber-Studded Brushed Aluminum Pedals


2 K3 Package
. Glass Sunroof
        - Sunroof is great. One touch. Also, the moonroof, it its opened, will not let any liquid (rain, snow) in if its left open - very useful in rainy areas.

� Power Rear-Window Sunshade
          - This isthe James Bond feature of the car. The sunshade comes out of the back panel and covers the rear window. Looks extremely cool. Problem, after a week - that thing broke (I probably played around with it too much). The car is at the dealer - they are fixing it.

3. K4 Package

. Headlamp Washing System
You have to see this to believe it. This is very cool!
� Bi-Xenon Headlamps
Xenons are Xenons. What else can I write!

4. Command System:
This is the navigation system which is integrated into the controls along with the speedometer. Its navigation, CD, Sound settings and much much more. The command system probably needs a separate review. Overall opinion, its great!

5. Heated seats: Two modes - regular and extra crispy. Try the extra crispy with something very thin on for some fun with your buttocks

6. 6CD changer. Its in dash, and is very fast cycling between the CD. With my configuration it is actually a total of 7 CDs, one for Command system, the other 6 for music.

So those are the options. Now for other cool things.

The sound out of this car is simply amazing. Its a BOSE system and it is best I've ever heard. It also adjusts its sound for the noise level.
The sound settings (beside Bass, treble, etc) have ambience levels, for different type of music, and optimization levels (i.e. driver). A lot of fun.

The ride is very smooth. The car feels extremely powerful and it exterminates the bumps on the road. You can't even feel them. Its a very, very solid car.

The in-dash settings controls are out of this world. There is a feature that you can turn on, from your wheel, is called Park Assist. What it does is that as soon as you put your car in reverse, the side mirrors tilt down, so you see the curb better. After you're done, they move back up into their stored position.

There are a lot of more little, extremely cool things, such as the rear fog-light, the compartment that opens from both sides, the, the, the... I won't give away too much.

As compared to other, similar sized coupes (my friend just bought the new Infinity G35 coupe), the seats in the back are very comfortable and there is more room. Obviously the CL500 will have much more room compared to the CLK, but CLK, for its size will do. Moreover, the front seats, if looking at them from the back, have wedges for knees of the back-passengers. That way, its even more comfortable.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the car, except for the long time I spent waiting for it (I ordered it in late August, got it in Mid December). Also, the sunshade thing upset me a little - but Mercedes service is taking care of that for me. 

P.S. If the mafia locks you up in your own trunk, there is a special release button, that opens the trunk from the inside. Mercedes dealers claim that its for a baby "if it gets trapped inside"

P.P.S. Almost forgot. It has two types of traction control between which you can toggle. One is the summer control (S) the other is Winter (S).

The summer traction control is the standard one, the winter one is the cool one. When the car gets stuck in snow (and its rear-wheel drive), instead of spinning the rear wheels indefinitely, getting into snow even more, the winter control makes them spin at 1/4 turns, that move the snow away.

The traction on this car is also great. It helps you steer, and brake.

The automatic shifting also memorizes the way you drive and switches gears according to your driving!
