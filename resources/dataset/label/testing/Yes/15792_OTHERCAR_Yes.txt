            Well, after only a short year and some change, the Stratus was replaced with a 2000 Town and Country LXi. Let me tell you why it was replaced.

At three in the morning, we receive a ring. Resentfully, I answered and it was my mother asking me to pick up my brother on the East side of Indiana; almost to the Ohio border. Keep in mind we live in Central Illinois. Not an afternoon drive by any means. While still trying to wake up and understand what the bloody hell was going on, my companion was going downstairs to get a disabled woman out of bed. 

While on the road, it started to rain. No problem, right? Although we had had almost no problems with the Stratus up to this point; this was Dodge's one 'Get out of jail free' card. We were on US-80 in Northern Indiana when traffic got very heavy at such an odd time of the morning. With the road wet, the car packed with 1,200lbs 5 people, it became a dangerous combination of oil and water. Long story short, the brakes became wet, the situation almost became critical. Subsequent reaction; next day, traded Stratus for Town and Country.

Let me tell you! The following weekend, we were summoned again to pick up my youngest brother from Nashville. He was done with school and needed transportation back to Illinois. Well, mother only has a Dakota and an LHS. Not enough to get all of his things. 

We decided to take out the third-row bench and leave the Captain's chairs in. That worked out perfectly. All three of us were comfy on the way down. When we packed all of his crap in to the van, the back end drooped a little, but so would you if you had 500-1000lbs on your rear. Anyway, the van had three large adults and one medium sized adult. Packed full and driving through the ranges of Tennessee were no hassle for the well geared 3.8 V-6. Well done, Chrysler. Now all you need to work on is your transmissions.

Alright, the van was purchased used with 46K on it. It came equipped with 16" brushed aluminum rims mated to Michilen MXV4 tires, leather, heated front seats, second row captain's chairs, rear heat and air, power vents, keyless entry, dual climate control and much more. We got an excellent deal at $19,800 out the door, including financing. GREAT DEAL!!! 

Anyway, let me say that there was only about one seriously odd thing about the van. The front-windsheild wipers. The blades didn't want to stay on. I don't replace the blades, I replace the entire assembly; excluding arm! Had more issues with that than I care to admit. 

There are no negative issues to discuss about this van. The economy is adequate in town, great on the highway. After two trips to the Eastern Seaboard, there are still no major concerns with the vehicle. Of course the suspension is going to be stiffened with some heavy duty shocks and the timing-belt needs to be replaced. But that is routine maintinence.

All in all, this is a testament to the skills and craftmenship that Chrysler is notourious for. I thank them. The van still looks fantastic and isn't embarrassing to drive. 

Happy Motoring.
