            I took delivery of a new Z3 on April 10, 2000, and am ecstatic about it.  With a big ticket item like a BMW, there is the potential of &quot;buyer's remorse&quot; once the newness wears off, but the more I drive it the only thing I regret is not buying it sooner.  I thoroughly researched all available sport cars - not ruling out any - and tried to be logical:  I wanted safety, styling, handling, and a vehicle that would maintain its value as I plan to keep it 10 + years.  While I liked the price of the Miata, its lack of roll bars eliminated it from my list. My wife and I  have a 1994 BMW 325i and a 1994 Isuzu Rodeo� no children at home� so I can keep the Z3 garaged on days of bad weather. (I have driven it on a miserably rainy day... no leaks at all from the roof). Make no mistake - if the Z3 is your ONLY vehicle, it will be difficult putting those plants and mulch into the small trunk!

The 2000 model has a rear end design that is subtly different from earlier models... a little longer and taller... I always thought that the 1999 and earlier models looked a little &quot;small&quot; in the rear end.  The tail lights are also redesigned and they give a wider look to the rear.

I carefully evaluated and selected the color and options, and got exactly the vehicle I wanted.  (Note that air conditioning and power windows are standard on all Z3's.)  Here are my choices:

Engine - I opted for the 2.8 liter.  While it is only marginally more powerful that the 2.5 liter (and the model that has the 2.5 engine has a &quot;2.3&quot; emblem on the back!) the 2.8 comes with much nicer wheels and Z-rated tires.

Transmission - I chose the 5 speed� remember, it's a sports car!

Color/Interior - Steel Gray with black leather and wood interior trim.  Steel Gray is a new color for BMW and looks great against the chrome trim and black wheels, top, and interior.  I wanted leather and wood� again, it's a sports car!

Chrome trim package - Not too much, but nice accents here and there.

Driving Computer - Displays outside temperature, time, miles-to-empty, MPG, average speed� I use it much more than I thought I would.

Upgraded Audio System with in-dash CD Player - this is a factory installed Harman-Kardon system with subwoofer that automatically increases the bass and volume as you go faster.  Excellent audio quality.

Electric Top - Didn't want this, but it was already on the only car in this area that had my other options.  An electric top is definitely not needed.

A &quot;must have&quot; option is a removable windscreen that attaches to the roll bars and keeps the wind from blowing back into the cockpit.  This is available from the BMW dealer's parts department and really works; we can comfortable drive at 70 MPH with the top and windows down and not get blown out by the wind.  It sells for $149, but I got my salesman to include it to &quot;close the deal.&quot;

The Z3 has incredible handling, even for a &quot;regular&quot; driver like me.  An example:  The other day I left my Memphis office and drove down into the Mississippi countryside to visit a friend who has a farm.  I followed a winding two-lane blacktop that has virtually no traffic� most of the way it is straight as an arrow and I can drive 60 - 80 MPH.  However, there is a double curve that's marked as &quot;Dangerous - 20 MPH&quot; that I took easily at 40 MPH.  Coming home later that night I was cruising at 60 MPH and somehow missed the sign warning about the curve...  next thing I knew I was into it at 60... nothing I could do except steer! The Z3 tracked as true as if it were on rails, nary a slide nor even a roll!  I bet I could have taken that curve at 70 MPH!

Buy a Z3 - you will be amazed at what a fine driving machine it is!
