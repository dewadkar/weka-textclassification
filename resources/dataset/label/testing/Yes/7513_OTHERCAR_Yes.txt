            I bought my 97 Dodge Stratus in May 1999 after a long search for a comfortable and affordable mid size car.  I have friends that own the identical car and after talking to them and test driving the Stratus at various dealerships I found it to be a good buy for the money.  I have two pre-teen children who feel there is more room in the back seat of the Stratus than there was in the back seat of the 92 Taurus we traded in.  The particular car we purchased came with the 4cylinder engine, I would have preferred to have the 6 cylinder that is also available but really liked this car and it had low miles on it making it even more appealing,  However, after driving this car, both in town and on road trips thru the mountains, I feel very comfortable with the 4 cylinder engine, it has a lot of power and has no problems keeping up with the speed thru the hills.
  On the downside, the back seat folds down for extra trunk room and you can only fold the entire seat down rather than part of it, so when you use this option, you lose your back seat area completely.  Also the drink holders in the front seat are placed in a bad place making it hard to use for larger cups because of the height restrictions.   I have recently had a problem with the steering that the Dodge dealer states is a update but is unwilling to fix within the extended warranty so I am responsible to pay for it.  It isn't a functional problem but a noise problem and that is why they aren't willing to repair it.
  All and all I am very satisfied with my car and feel I got a good bargain for my needs and for what I was looking for in a car
