            The Ford vehicles of the 1940s, 1950s are still shining and going strong on Calle Malecon.  Even though the spare parts are nonexistent to maintain, most Cubans become creative and deal with their own repair.  It appears that most of them are mechanics.  Here, my point is that a well-built vehicle is a piece of art.  I bet you that most Cubans will own their vehicles until Fidel dies of old age in power or until the new revolution brings new American cars to the island.  As for Toyota, I can't seem to forget the Land Cruiser of the 1980s.  

I had my first experience with a Land Cruiser when I was working for a Travel company in the Caribbean a few years ago.  Actually, the Land Cruiser is the vehicle of choice for this kind of business.  Since the roads were in bad conditions, it made sense that the owners of the company bought three of them for their the travel agency.  Besides being a comfortable vehicle, it handled well on the road.  No potholes or muds or rivers scared its drivers away.  Actually, there were some close calls.  On most occasions, we managed to get to our final destination.  Is there such a thing as off-road driving in Cuba, for example?  It's something that is done every day.  For one thing, the roads are not paved as smooth as the US.  No matter what, in major cities, you can drive on paved roads.  Some of the other Caribbean countries where I drove had practically no paved roads.  The Land Cruiser makes traveling a more reliable experience.

<b>Retro Lifestyle</b>

Toyota has come up with new models since then.  They now have the following: the Highlander, the RAV4, the Sequoia, and the 4Runner.  For some reasons, despite all the great designs and technology that are packed in these vehicles, I enjoy the simplicity and the comfort of the first Land Cruiser.  This is not saying that it should be taken for granted.  Believe me, if you buy one, you won't feel disappointed.

<b>What's all the hoopla about the Land Cruiser?</b>

*  Seek Comfort:  you will have lots of head and leg room.  

*  Seek a great variety of design 

*  Seek toughness, durability

*  How about torque?

Each time I test drive one of the most recent models, I think about my first time driving a Land Cruiser on that Caribbean island.  It may be expensive, but if you own one, it is for life or a long, very long time.
