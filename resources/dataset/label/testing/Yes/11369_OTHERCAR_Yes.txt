            We purchased a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan last summer and are extremely pleased with it. It handles very well and is quite roomy. I especially like the easy access and convenience of having 5 doors. My husband drove us from Florida to Indiana in 16 hours and said the seat was very comfortable the whole trip. It got excellent gas mileage and handled very nicely on the snow and ice.
The only problem we've had with it is the rotors had to be replaced at only 3000 miles and again after 6000 miles but hopefully the problem will be corrected. 
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who enjoys comfort and quality in driving.<br><br>
