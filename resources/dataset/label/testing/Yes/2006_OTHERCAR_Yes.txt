            I picked up a Frontier King Cab XE 2WD with a 2.4 4 cylinder engine in late December of 2002 and have now had it over 1 year.  The only thing wrong with it after taking delivery was a bad jump seat spring on the driver side jump seat.  The entire seat had to be replaced but this was due to service department bungling.  The option package was good which included: bed liner, CD player, tinted glass among other basic stuff.  The package was light on options but gave everything needed.  The CD player is great.  The truck feels solid and sure while driving.  It even feels stiff while going over bumpy roads.  The power is a little lacking in the top end revs while changing gears.  This was solved by installing a K&N performance air filter and Bosch platinum spark plugs.  These are direct drop in replacements.  The engine was wheezing over 3,000 RPM and the filter opened it up just enough to put the power where it should be.  Little 4 cylinders need to rev and this one does now.  Super-unleaded fuel makes a big difference because new Nissans have extremely sensitive knock sensors.  With regular unleaded the ignition timing get scaled back reducing power and rev-ability.  This Frontier has a five speed which changes gears smoothly.  No tilt wheel makes getting comfy a little harder and seat position is critical.  The seat and interior quality are good- nice and sporty.  The gas mileage is good around town, great on the highway and it has a 15.9 gallon tank.  I picked this Nissan Frontier over the S-10 or Ranger because I hope the Nissan's reputation for quality holds out.  I am happy with this purchase.  It now has 9,000 miles.  I will update this review periodically so stay tuned!  One note to keep in mind is that the back seats are incredibly small.  My elementary school kids barely fit in there.  Flipping the seats up and just using the extra space for storage is more practical.
