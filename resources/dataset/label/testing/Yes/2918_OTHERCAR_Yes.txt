            I upgraded to the RSX Type-S from a 1999 Sentra SE-Limited.  The Sentra has a SR20DE 2.0 Liter Engine with 140hp and 135lbs of torque.  I was very  happy with the power band, 4 door accessibility, and it's over practicality.  Then I realized my years of being impractical is limited, so I better get a impractical car while I can!!  Obviously, the RSX Type-S beats my Sentra in every single category, (except my Sentra had an armrest)

Thus my list of cars to get:

VW GTI VR6 or 1.8T
Subaru WRX
Mercedes Benz C230 Kompressor Coupe
Toyota Celica GT-S

I will organize this review by comparing why I chose the RSX over each of these cars, followed by my impression of the car after I've owned it.

1.VW GTI
Strengths: Solid Look (despite being outdated), Gorgeous Interior, decent power.

Weakness: Lack of Reliability

I have been a VW fan for a long time, and still am.  They really pack a lot of value in their cars.  They have a very German feel to them, and are truly "Small on the outside, big in the inside".  They use top-grade material, and have very very nice interiors for the price.  The 1.8T engine pumps out 180 turbocharged horsies, while the 24v new VR6 that is shared with the Eurovan pumps out 201hp.

The only reason I did not buy this car was because VW has reliability issues.  They have known issues with the Air Flow Sensors, 2nd Gear Grinding, and Air Flow Sensors.  VWs are also not very tightly put together, and they experience an inordinate amount of squeaks and rattles.  I do not have time to stress over car problems, and regardless of its 'value', they are not enough to outweigh it's reliability.

2.Subaru WRX
Strengths: AWD Turbo

Weakness: Only has AWD Turbo

For some.... AWD Turbo is all they needed.  There are very few AWD Turbo out there.  Audi A4 1.8T Quattro, Eclipse GSX, or 3000GT VR-4 are the only cars I can think of, and 2 of those are discontinued.  The WRX is just a lot of punch for 25k.  For a performance enthusiast, there is no better car out there.  I was so close to closing a deal on one because I like to go snowboarding, and the AWD will be just fantastic.

After some thought, here are the reasons I backed out of the awesome deal (25.5K out the door fully loaded, had a friend at dealership).
1. I am not going to drive my  new car in the snow!!
2. No Sunroof
3. Kinda froggy looking front end
4. Very dated interior

I want more in a car than just performance, it's too bad Subaru couldn't put more in the car without increasing the price tag.  But I felt I was getting more car with the RSX Type-S, despite the fact the WRX could run circles around it.

3. Mercedes Benz C230

Strength: BENZ!!! SUPERCHARGED!!! What more can I say?

Weakness: $$$

This is one cool Benz.  It has a panoramic moon roof that is HUGE, nice interior, tons of options and features, and a supercharged engine that performs very well in this light car (in Mercedes Standards at least).  It looks very refined, until you reach the back end, then it is up in the air.  I personally think it looks nice.

Being the cheapest Mercedes, it's in no way cheap.  The base price increases exponentially with options.  They have so many options it almost appears you have to pay for the steering wheel and seats.  The price easily balloons to 30k if you want it decently equipped.... and that's unfortunately out of my price range.

Although Mercedes are 'reliable' to an extent.... there are so many things that can go wrong in this technologically advanced car.  And believe me (my dad has a C280), Mercedes are NOT CHEAP to fix.  So because I'm not making enough to support this car, I decided to wait. 

4. Toyota Celica GT-S
Strength: Awesome Handling, Sporty Look, Toyota Reliability

Weakness: Cheap Interior Materials, Poor Gearing

Toyota, Toyota, Toyota... you almost had a winner here, but you really blew it on the gear ratios.  The car would have a much much more powerful power band if it had been geared differently.  It is in no way slow, but it could have been a lot faster.

The GT-S is by far the closest competitor to the RSX Type-S.  They have the most similarities of any car you can compare to the RSX.  I must admit the GT-S seems to handle a tad better than the RSX Type-S, but I felt the RSX bettered the GT-S in every other category.

Winner! RSX Type-S 

It pretty much came down to the wire between the WRX and the RSX.  From what I have heard from other RSX Owners, this is a similar road they have traveled.  The decision seems to be split, and both WRX and RSX owners have a pretty good case for their decision.

The new i-VTEC allows for this car to have more useable horsepower.  You will have to drive it like you hate it if you want to get the full 200hp, but cruising around town, you don't feel quite as gutless as other Honda VTEC Engines.

They are both wonderful cars, and it is all about what you want.  I wanted something that is more grown up and refined.  I was willing to sacrifice a few horsepower and AWD for auto-climate control, leather seats, moon-roof, 6-Spd Transmission, and getting 30miles per gallon. 

My biggest dissapointment about this car is that it doesn't have LSD (limited slip differential).  That feature is reserved for the Integra Type-R (RSX in Japan, and everywhere else but here), and that model is not coming to the US.  I also hoped that it would have an arm rest, but I have adapted to not having one. Other than that, I'm 100% satisfied.

I am just so happy with my RSX Type-S, there is no doubt in my mind that I made the right choice.
