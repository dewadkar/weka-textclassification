            I made the decision to purchase a digital camera after forking over a few too many of my hard-earned dollars to develop roll upon roll of film. I really wasn't interested in anything fancy, just something to get my foot in the door. After doing a little bit of research and some surfing of HP's web site, I decided to go ahead with the purchase of the HP C200.

Having had the camera in my possession for a couple months now, I have to say that the HP C200 is one of the best values out there in the megapixel range. The camera itself worked great &quot;out of the box.&quot; 

Instructions were easily understood, buttons are intuitively placed, and the menus that pop up on the LCD display are self-explanatory (although there are very few picture-taking options beyond a 2x digital zoom). The LCD display itself leaves much to be desired. There are two LCD modes: picture-taking and picture-viewing. The LCD display in the picture-taking mode is extremely choppy, almost rendering it useless as an aiming device (I'd recommend using the the normal view-finder). 

The picture viewing mode has slightly more value, but if you didn't purchase an AC adapter at the same time you purchased the camera, you might want to rectify the situation. As with any camera, the LCD severely drains the batteries (and the C200 uses 4 AA batteries, so look out!). 

The pictures themselves are of good quality (there are three quality settings on the camera itself as well), with crisp images and vivid colors. No matter which picture quality setting is chosen, the resolution is 1152 x 864 (safely in the megapixel range). 

The only arena in which I had any problems was the actual transfer of the pictures from the memory card to my computer (the camera purchase includes a 8MB memory card). My link cable was faulty, but rather than contacting HP and ordering a new cable, I simply purchased a memory card reader instead. I haven't heard of anyone else experiencing the same problem, however. 

In summation, this camera is great for someone who isn't interested in breaking the bank or reading a 500-page manual before jumping into the joys of digital photography. <br><br>
