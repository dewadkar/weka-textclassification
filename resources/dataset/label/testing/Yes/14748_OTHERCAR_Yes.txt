            i bought an 86 crx for 1000 dollars. this was the best investment i have ever made. from gas milage, to car milage the crx drives for chaeper than any other car i have found, while not sacrificing power, speed or accelleration. 
i can fill up my tank for $15 and drive for well over 200 miles. the car has been low maintainance so far. my car has 165000 miles on it, and the only things i have had to replace were the clutch and the front axels. other than that it has run exceptionaly well. 
another one of the advantages to the crx is its maneuverablity. i have never lost control of this car, even haulin' balls through windy canyons, this car never even slips. and i have never se3en a 2 wheel drive vehicle do better in snow. i live in a loan that is constantly covered with snow. i see all kinds of vehicle on the side of the road, stuck in a ditch, and i have never slipped once. and if you do get stuck in the ditch, the car is light enough to pull right out. 
i would highly recogmend tohis car to any one who drives by themselves, and wants to get better gas milage, and anyone who loves todrive.<br><br>
