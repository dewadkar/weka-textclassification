            Out of boredom, I went to test drive an Xterra.  I had done some research on the Nissan website, so I knew a lot about the truck to begin with.  I did not plan on buying anything for another year.  I had the salesman go with me on the test drive, and I asked questions on everything.  It's roomy on the inside, and has compartments everywhere.  Anyway, I was pretty impressed with the answers he gave.  I saw a terrain area and decided to test the 4x4.  When I got back on the highway, I put it back in 2x4 and heard the brush falling out from the bottom of the truck.  I gave the salesman my checkbook right there!

I bought the XE, with the Sport, Utility and Power packages.  Some nice extras that I like: the power to the windows stays on for a few minutes after the key is out of the ignition.  Also, for short people like myself, there is a handle to pull the hatch down.  Not to mention the window shade to hide your gear, the back seats come out for more room,  and the back seats sit up high, so your back seat drivers can have a clear view.  The truck is very roomy.  I bought 5 bookcases today, and fit them all in the truck in one trip.  It fits ALL of your gear, groceries, work stuff, and other junk.

Now the cons.  In my opinion, these are minor.  If you put the back windows down while you're on the expressway, you get a helicoptor sound, due to the roof rack (wind buffet).  Of course, the gas mileage sucks compared to a car, but the gas tank is only about 15 gallons so you're not spending your paycheck at the gas station.  This is expected for an SUV.  The back windows only go down half way (my personal pet peeve with most cars).  Finally, it's such a good truck that you see them everywhere you go.

Overall, it's a great SUV that handles like a truck.  It will look good on you, and you'll turn heads when driving.

Go 'head...but it!
