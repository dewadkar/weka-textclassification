            The Dimera 3500 is a great camera if what you are looking to do is take simple photos to upload to a web site. I bought my first one to take pictures of objects I was selling on Ebay. Pretty straight forward, point and shoot.
No auto focus. I found that using a desk lamp to control the illumination aspect of the shot composure resulted in some pretty good photos. I was even able to do some  really neat close-up shots using this technique. I bought the second 3500 after absent-mindedly attaching the wrong ac adapter to the camera and frying its little brains out...oh well, me bad! You can't shoot 19 volts into a camera designed to run on 3 volts...Who knew!! Bought both at online auctions. The first on Egghead dot.com for $89; the second just last week at Ubid.com for $49. It pays to shop around. Use the various search engines.
