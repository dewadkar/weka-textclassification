            I became a Toyota fan after I purchased a Celica GT brand new in 1984.  I kept that car for 10 years with the only maintenance being regular oil changes.  In 1994, I bought a Camry coupe and just loved it.  When my lease was up, Toyota was no longer making a Camry coupe.  

I did not want a 4-door (I call them &quot;mommy&quot; cars) and opted to hold onto that Camry a little while longer.  Imagine my delight when the Solara came out!  I immediately knew I wanted one.  

I bought my Solara in May 1999 and absolutely love everything about it.  The exterior styling is great, the interior is well-appointed and comfortable.  Sound system (JBL 6-speaker system) is fantastic, the ride is extremely quiet.  Gas mileage is what I expected.  I bought the V6 SLE with ALL the bells and whistles:  It is black with leather seats, spoiler, alloy wheels, CD/tape deck, AM/FM stereo, side air bags, moon roof, climate control power driver's seat, power windows, keyless entry, alarm.  I really like the three programmable garage openers as I have remotes for the gate to my condo complex, my individual garage door, and the gate where I work.  This was just way too many remote controls to have to carry around.  

The only maintenance I have done is regular oil changes.  

Everyone who sees the car likes it.  I have had adults ride in the back seat on occasion, and they have found it generally comfortable.  I would probably not recommend this car to someone who has to tote kids around.

I cannot think of anything that I don't like about the Solara.  For me, it is a sheer joy to drive.<br><br>
