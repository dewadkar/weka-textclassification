            Bought the vehicle because of 1) The end of 2000 year pricing and financing and 2) The Infiniti experience.

The one shortcoming of the QX4 is the under powered engine....it performs adequately for freeway and around town duties, however when pressed at high altitudes and/or full cargo it requires constant downshifting.

Overall quality is excellent with excellent dealer support.

I drove the 2001 QX4 with the 240 HP engine and surprisingly it wasn't that much quicker and overall not much change.

Bottom line.....excellent appointments for an SUV.......nice style.....good for the daily commute, however a little short on the engine side.
