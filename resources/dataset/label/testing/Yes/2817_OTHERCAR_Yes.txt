            I bought my white '92 Jetta 2 door in April 2002 because I wanted a reliable car in decent condition for a reasonable price. The body really has almost no rust at all, which is extremely rare for an 11 year old car in Montreal. In the 5 months I've owned it it hasn't left me stranded, and I have no reason to think it might do so in the future.
  
However, I have been a bit disappointed in how much the car has cost me to maintain, though most of it was probably due to neglect on the part of the previous owner. In 5 months I have changed all 4 shocks, 2 tires, a drive shaft, timing belt, oil pan and valve cover gaskets, spark plugs and wires (though these weren't really necessary), an engine temperature sender, and I had to have the brakes bled and adjusted, since the rears weren't working at all when I took delivery of the car (though it still stopped better than the 92 Olds I drove before buying this car). All this amounts to about $2000CDN, which is a fair chunk of money to spend on a car I paid only $3700 for to begin with. 
  
Now that it's all done, though, I have to admit I wouldn't easily part with my car. For an econobox it handles quite well, and would be downright dangerous with the right tires and springs on it. The car is so light and compact, it kind of feels like driving a go-kart. Just throw it around and it'll do what you want it to. At the same time, though, it's very stable on the highway, which shouldn't be too shocking considering it was built by a country that has no speed limits on their Autobahns. The car reminds you of its light weight when the roads get slippery, though. It understeers fairly easily on wet roads and doesn't give much warning before the back end snaps out on you. This can be a lot of fun, but it scared the hell out of me the first time it happened and I almost went sideways into a wall on a highway onramp (Punk teenage drivers, eh?) The brakes aren't spectacular, but they're decent and even when the rear ones weren't working, it stopped faster than the 94 Cavalier Z-22 I was also looking at for the same price, did. No ABS on my car, and that's the way I like it. The brakes are easy to modulate, but do tend to lock up on slippery roads probably due to the car's light weight and small tires. 
  
Acceleration with the 5 speed is decent enough, as long as you're not hauling around a lot of people or cargo. It'll go, though, as long as you don't mind revving up the engine, which this car loves to do. Even after 190,000km (~115k miles), I can rev the engine right to redline without so much as a buzz from under the hood. Fuel economy is good, though not spectacular. The gas tank is huge, though, so you won't be filling up too frequently. Doing highway driving, I can do 800 km (~550 miles) on a 55 liter tank. I'm burning very little oil, and the engine really almost feels and sounds like a new one. I've seen ones with almost double the mileage on mine still running strong.
  
Speaking of highway driving, the engine is quite noisy at higher speeds because the car is geared very low. In 5th going 100km/h (60 MPH), I'm turning 3000 RPM. The up side to this is that passing power on the highway is quite respectable. The car can still hit 170km/h plus (110 MPH), so it's really not much of an issue. Like I said, this car doesn't seem to mind high revs.
  
On the inside the car has held up very well. The upholstery looks almost new, and the materials on the doors and dash are very nice, unlike the plastic garbage on a lot of American cars. There are some rattles when going over potholed streets, but overall it's fairly quiet. The seats are amazingly comfortable even in the base model. The ones in the GLI are to die for. Driving position in either is nice, and head room is markedly high for a compact car. My car has tilt steering, which is a nice feature, and the dash is very simple and easy to read. All the controls, including the heater and radio, are very high up, and easy to reach. Control stalks have a solid, quality feel to them. Rear seat room is surprisingly good, and you really can seat 4 to 5 adults in the car, despite the fact that mine is a 2 door. (I actually like having only 2 doors: The interior room is the same, my front doors are longer which actually eliminates the blind spot created right next to your head since the b-pillar is moved back. It's also a lot less common and sleeker looking than the 4 door, and a bit lighter, so acceleration is theoretically slightly better.) The 6 speaker cassette stereo is clear, but underpowered. Don't expect to impress anyone with this one, but it gets the job done.
  
Open the trunk and you'll just about fall over. It's massive. The most I've ever had in there was my mountain bike (with wheels taken off), a sleeping mattress, a tent, various emergency supplies, and my luggage. And I still had room to spare. I literally can fit everything I own into this car (granted that doesn't mean too much seeing as how I'm an 18 year-old male).
  
My bottom line on this car is that it has cost me a lot of money (for a student on minimum wage), but it actually looks fairly stylish, the original paint still glistens in the sun, it'll keep up with traffic and even surprise the occasional driver in an automatic if you know how to handle a stick(I once kept up with a Mustang V-8 coming off a stop light... no kidding. Of course he would have smoked me if we had kept going past 50km/h.), and most importantly, it'll get you where you're going with no worries. I drove it for 13 hours straight from Montreal to Halifax, and twice to Albany, without any trouble. What more can you ask from an 11 year-old car worth less than a new laptop computer?

*Update: February 4, 2004
The car is still running strong. Salted roads have taken their toll on the body a little bit, but after a good washing and polishing the car still looks good, albeit with some rust spots. Since the major repairs I described earlier, the only other significant money I put into the car was on new brakes and better tires (Dunlop Sport A2 - they work quite well and have eliminated the car's tendency to fishtail in the wet). 

I'm still barely adding any oil between changes, and the car has seen its share of 1000km+ trips, with a guy who likes to massage the gas pedal and work the revs into the fun zone. In these nearly 2 years I've had the car, the closest thing I ever came to being stranded has been when the car wouldn't start in pretty extreme cold on my driveway. A quick jump from the parents' car, and I was on my way. Otherwise it's been 100% reliable in the 40,000 km (25k miles) I've driven the car, despite a number of times being subjected to -30C cold starts. 

Current mileage is at 214,000 km (133k miles), and it still drives as well as when I bought it, though perhaps with a few more rattles coming from the doors and dash. This has turned out to be a much better long-term investment than my original cash outlay and early repairs suggested. It's still a blast to carve up the backroads with. Just watch out for the VW trademark inside rear wheel lift around sharp corners - I had it happen at least once; it's a lot less scary than it sounds (actually it's pretty cool and doesn't affect handling), and it's probably happened when I wasn't even aware of it.

Overall, I'm still happy with the car, and would recommend it even more enthusiastically than I did a year ago. I'll also say that with cars as old as this, preventative maintenance is what makes the difference between a car that'll leave you stranded every other week, and one which you'll feel comfortable taking week-long road trips in. Happy motoring!
