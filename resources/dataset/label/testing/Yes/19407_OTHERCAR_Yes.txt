            The CR-V is another Car-Based &quot;SUV&quot; designed to cash in on the trend of &quot;Rugged Utility Vehicles&quot;, and it appears to have performed this task admirably. But what lies underneath the flashy paint and the (admittedly nifty) picnic table?

Lets get one thing out in the open right away: This is not a truck. It was not designed to be a truck, and it makes no appologies for not being a truck. As such, it is not designed to handle extreme off-road trails. Now depending on your perception of the term &quot;Off-Road&quot;, this vehicle may or may not be able to handle minor to moderate off-road situations. This is not to say that it would handle the famed Rubicon Trail, nor Moab Utah. It would be ground to scrap metal in moments.

But this is not where the CR-V's capabilities lay.

The CR-V is really just a modern adaptation of Honda's AWD Civic Wagon (You still see many of them driving around the streets of Denver, particularly on snowy days), it was never a big seller, as it came too soon and did not advertise as being &quot;Rugged&quot; and &quot;Adventurous&quot;, but it did have a comfortable niche. It was not (nor is it now) a fuel guzzling powerhouse, designed with rock-crawling and motorboat towing in mind (In fact, it's tow capacity is just 1,000 pounds. Several sedans have tow rates which exceed this). 

It did, however, handle a great deal more cargo (and people) than your average civic.

So Honda decided to bring it back, and make it a little bit flashier.

The CR-V is an exceptional vehicle for family transportation, in good weather and bad. It's fuel effeciency is not the greatest in the world, but certainly not as bad as many truck-based SUV's. It's larger cabin provides better 'hauling' capability than a comparative AWD sedan, and, lets face it, that picnic table is just plain nifty. 
It can make its way through several inches of snowfall with a sure grip on the road, and stop with the same assuredness, thanks to the antilock brake system Honda installed. 

Unfortunitly, it is slightly underpowered (Honda, are you listening? V6 Vtec!), which causes much dread on the uphill portions of I-70 (Anyone who lives in colorado, knows about Floyd Hill.) On the test drive that I was on, I was able to hold a top speed of 55mph, which impressed me, as I thought it would be less, but still left me wanting for more as Jeeps, Isuzu's, Dodge's and Fords passed me by at speeds more than 10mph greater. 

And while it can make its way quite nicely through several inches of snow, Colorado is often known for several *FEET* of snow at a time, and the CR-V does not bode well in this area, being left behind to the Jeeps, Land-Rovers, Toyota's, and other trucks. 


The overall consensus is; if you live in a rather flat area, which gets light to moderate amonuts of snowfall, and you want to move the family around in comfort to the beach (and have a picnic!), This is the car for you.

If you live in a mountainous area, with a lot of snowfall, and like to tow heavy objects (insert Tim Allen grunts here), I would pass for something with a larger engine, better tow rate, and more ground clearence.<br><br>
