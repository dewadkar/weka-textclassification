            I own a 1996 Toyota Corolla and couldn't ask for a more dependable, safer, reliable car.

The Corolla is small and light, but still has four doors, usable back seats, and a decent trunk.  I drove to a park for a canoe trip with it once with four guys, gear for a week, and a canoe on the roof and it was fine!  I mean, I didn't pass anyone going uphill, but for a small economy car, that is as much as you could ask.

The interior materials have held up well.  The drivers controls are well laid out and easy to use.  The base stereo is poor, but is easily changed.

Fuel economy is great.  I get about 525km in the summer and 450km in the winter on a 35-40 litre tank of gas (sorry for all the American readers, but I don't have a calculator handy to convert that to miles and gallons).  The car is actually pretty good in the snow because of the narrow tires, and even better if you replace the standard all-seasons with winters.

My car is red and requires biannual waxing to keep it from turning pinkish, but then I have always parked it outside.

Servicing is very cheap with this car, mainly because nothing ever goes wrong with it.  If you keep up the regular stuff, like brakes and oil changes, the car will never bother you and you can keep it forever.  The engine sounds as good as the day I bought it, and there are no squeaks or rattles.

Actually, a few things did go wrong:  the air conditioner pulley had to be replaced after 140 000 km, and the drivers seat belt twice got stuck and had to be replaced.  The second  time it was outside warranty and I paid for it, then later learned that Toyota unofficially warranties seatbelts for life and I could have taken it back to the dealer.

I have size 13 feet and have always found the pedals and footrest too small.  Also I have long legs and find the legroom and kneeroom to be less than I want, but I find the car to be comfortable overall and often after renting other, bigger cars for work trips, am glad to be back in my Corolla.

The engine is 1.6 litres and doesn't generate much horsepower.  I find that 0-60 km/h it is fairly peppy, but after that it takes a long time to get up to speed.  I suppose the automatic transmission doesn't help.  I have learned to mash my foot down on the gas just before it changes into 3rd, which lets it rev a bit longer and gives it a little extra jolt of speed, but in general short on-ramps are problematic.  There are no problem up hills, and the A/C doesn't impact the cars performance.  The car is fairly noisy on the road but good for it's size and class.

I love the car in the city because it is so easy to park, turn, and generally fit in spaces the giant SUVs don't.

Corolla's really keep their value, which is great if you already own one, but makes it tough to buy one.  Don't be fooled by price - my 96 Corolla is more expensive than many newer non-Corolla economy cars, but I know I can drive my Corolla forever!  You'll never regret buying it.

The suspension in the Corolla is very soft.  Small bumps are absorbed well but big ones rock the car.  There is considerable lean in corners and the car dives during braking.  If your mechanic hasn't set up the front rotors and back drums exactly right, the car will shimmy under hard braking as well.  Despite the independent suspension front and rear, this car is meant to be driven sedately.  You don't   want to do any emergency maneuvers with it.

My Corolla was made in Cambridge, Ontario.  US Corollas are made somewhere else.  If you can find a Geo Prizm, buy it because they are twins of the Corolla and usually sell for much less because they have the Geo name and not Toyota.  The cars are identical in most every way, like the Vibe is to the Matrix.

I won't even talk about the Corolla's styling because it is so bland that I am having trouble remembering what it looks like.  It will never look bad and it will never look good, it  is just sort of there.

Having said all these good things about my car, I am sad to say that I am going to replace it soon.  I plan on buying a car with more driver comfort and better performance.  I will probably buy another Toyota just because I have been so impressed with the quality.  I also got some dealer quotes on prices for my Corolla as a trade-in and was amazed how much it has retained it's value.
