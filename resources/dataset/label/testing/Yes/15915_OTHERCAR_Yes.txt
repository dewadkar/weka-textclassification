            The Sable is perfect for anyone, single men and women, college students, and newly-weds.  Neither small nor expensive it is a perfect match.  The Sable has good handling, gadgets, great interior, and much, much more. The Sable gives you a smooth ride, and has a great sound system. Available in great colors, this car is loved by all. It's an all around great car, thart fits anyone's lifestyle. I recomend this automobile and I hope you buy one. I think this car, the Mercury Sable, is one of the best all around cars available on the market. It's a great car for a great price, and I think anyone would love to have a Sable in his or her driveway  <br><br>
