            We have owned a Ford Winstar for about 3 years now and have been extremely happy with the roominess, comfort, and ride of this vehicle.  It has been very dependable.  I have not had to bring the van back to the dealer for any type of repair.  We are at 42K miles and just had the front brakes redone and the tires changed which I think is fairly average for a vehicle of this weight.  We just took a 6 hour trip and the car is a cruisemobile!   It is quick off the start and very quiet even at the 70 MPH range.  Gas mileage is average and not too bad on an extended trip.  BUT, the biggest factor is that one child is in the way back while the other child is in the middle seats.  This makes for a more stress-free trip. 
The Winstar is mainly driven by my wife and she just loves the feeling of being up a little higher.  She feels that she is able to see better and thus drive better.  Her only complaint is that the ride is so quiet that she needs to check her speed often since it tends to climb easily :) just tell that to Mr. officer!  The side view mirrors stick out a little so when we go into/out of the garage, we need to be very careful, only a couple inches of clearance.
We test drove the Chrysler equivalent which are also nice but decided to go with the Ford since we have had great luck with Fords.  My 1990 Probe is still running as if it was new!<br><br>
