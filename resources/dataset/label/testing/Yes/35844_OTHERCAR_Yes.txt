            I picked up my 1993 Saturn SL2 a little over a year and a half ago.  It had 172,000 miles on it and I got it dirt cheap.  I just needed a vehicle to go back and forth to work, and this fit the bill.  The body and interior were in such good shape that I knew the last and original owner took good care of it.  It is a basic car; no power anything or sunroof and a 5 speed transmission.  I even added an after market cruise control.  What I got in return was a reliable and comfortable car that seems to think it is still new.  Anyone who drives in my car cannot believe that it now has 193,000 miles on it.  It burns no oil (note: it does use the Saturn norm of 1 quart of oil between oil changes), and runs smooth and strong.  The 5 speed does help greatly with acceleration and it is effortless to merge with traffic.  The quality of the interior has little to be desired and I absolutely hate the automatic shoulder straps, especially if I accidentally touch the inside track of the straps (it has a graphite grease that is hard to wash off).  But overall, the interior has few rattles and the seats are very comfortable.  So, a piece of advice: want something very reliable, get a Saturn SL2 without all the bells and whistles, and a 5 speed transmission.  I intend on putting at least 300,000 miles on this car and I have no doubt it will make it.
