               As Editor in Chief of my college newspaper, I was tasked with the responsibility of purchasing a new digital camera.  
   Having a limited knowledge in the area of digital photography and cameras, I set out to bone up on my research.  One of the Deans of the college had recently purchased this exact model and offered to let me give it a test run for a few issues.  
   After using the Sony MVC Camera for two weeks I was thoroughly impressed with its ease of use, the availability of the 3 1/2 floppy disc storage, and the quality of the photographs.
   The camera, however slightly larger than other models, still weighs in at about the same weight, and the LCD viewer lets you see what your shooting almost like a camcorder.  
   By pushing a few buttons on the back I could easily navigate through the options menu, turn on and off the flash, and understand what I was doing without ever reading the instruction manual.  
   The fact that it has the floppy disc storage, made accessing the photos from any number of computer stations a breeze.  One of the few drawbacks was the fact that the 3.5 floppies can only hold 5-7 photos before you have to insert another disc.  If planning on shooting alot pictures, bring a few discs so you don't miss a thing!  After your done, save the photos to your computer and presto, you have clean disc to go out and use again and again.
   I would highly recommend this camera to any one who is just starting out and demands performance and quality in there digital photography.  <br><br>
