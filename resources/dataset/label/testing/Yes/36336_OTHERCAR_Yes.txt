            I am in love with my Celica. The car has smooth, well drawn curves and a smooth sporty look. The pop up headlights add a bit of fun for night time driving. The trunk and fold down back seat provide plenty of room assuming there are only 2 passengers. The car has some bite to accompany its bark. Even though it only has a 2.2 4 cylinder engine, it is incredibly quick. With a manual transmission, many cars equipped with bigger V-6's have eaten my dust. The official MPG is about 20/24 but I have gotten well over 30 on the highway. The Celica handles corners remarkably well and the brakes allow you to stop on a dime. It performs surprisingly well in snow, considering it's low ground clearance. Mine also came with a nice 6 speaker sound system which can be modified very easily.

The Celica is not perfect for everyone, however. The back seat is more useful for cargo space than carrying passengers. If you are taller than 6'1, you might feel a little cramped, although the bucket seats slide very far back.

Overall, the Celica is a great car. I bought mine with 140,000 miles and it has never let me down. It's great looks and surprising performance have kept my affections. It's a great car for college/high school students or anyone that doesn't need a lot of passenger room.
