            How can't you love a truck that runs like a hummer and feels like a vet. The S10 pickup is a good truck for your money. The 4wd is a great feature and comes in handy in the snow.
 The truck handles well in the wet and snowy conditions becasue of its weight. The steal is all matched. It rides smooth. Unlike most trucks its size it does not rattle or bump on ruff roads. 
The seats in the front are big and roomy. The back seat fold out of the wall like on a plane. If you need the room they fold fight away inside the wall. I would recommed this truck to anyone who needs a good truck to haul around crud. 
There is a one ton limit for the back and tow.
 If you are looking for a truck to use in contrustion this is the truck but it can't hold big big loads so if you  are looking for a truck that your hauls hardcore go up a level and 5 grand to the Chevy sliverrado.<br><br>
