            The object of this review is a 6 week old 2004 Forester XS with the Premium Package (body color molding, bumper protector, and sunroof).

I've had her now for just over 6 weeks and so far so good. It's a nice car for every day driving, chuckable enough to be interesting on tight roads at speed without getting scary, and spacious enough to haul all kinds of stuff.

For an "SUV", this thing handles like a good AWD car. It sits a little higher than Audi A4 fans will be used to, but because of the engine configuration and the extra effort Subaru put into the chassis and suspension design the center of gravity is low enough to offer a vehicle that corners well without the massive amounts of body roll you get in taller "small SUVs". After a blessedly short acclimation period I was right back to running twisty backroads at well over the speed limit, with no bad behaviour creeping up even when corners are taken at double the suggested safe speed.

Speaking of the engine, it's a very nice little package (DISCLAIMER: As the owner of a BMW R100GS motorcycle I am a fan of boxer type engines.) For 2.5 liters it puts out an easily accessible 165 horsepower and what feels like gobs of torque. The Forester weighs 3000 lbs, but she pulls hard right from zero. I test drove the XT version, which was quite impressive in a straight line, but Subaru's decision to only offer the sunroof with an automatic made that a non-option and I decided that the extra impetus at launch was not really worth the extra cost anyway when the non-turbo is more than quick enough to outrun your average cell-phone yakking suburbanite at a stoplight anyway.

The brakes are very good (4-wheel discs with ABS) and bring her to a stop quite quickly. At 3000 lbs, she weighs less than you think she will, so be prepared.

I've had a couple of chances to drive it on both snow and black ice now and I've been suitably impressed (my previous winter car was a BMW 325iX, which was great in the snow but a money pit otherwise). Subaru has earned its reputation the hard way, by going the extra mile to build a car that really does perform and then working to make it better and better. She handles snow with absolute calm, and the ABS brings her to a halt rapidly and in a perfectly straight line. She requires a bit more finesse from the driver on ice, but she still does well as long as you stay out of the brakes and don't push too hard coming out of corner, in which case she will powerslide quite nicely and controllably if you know how to drive with your right foot.

Inside, Subaru has done a nice job of building a quality car without running the bill up to atmospheric levels. The plastic does look a little cheaper than what you see in an Exploder, but then this thing costs quite a bit less as well and personally I bought this car to drive, not to admire the plastic interior. There are plenty of storage bins for stashing all your stuff, the in-dash 6 CD changer, with large buttons for switching disks or changing station presets, is a nice touch, and the climate controls (large round dials that are easy to understand and use right from the get go) should be the standard against which all others are measured. There is plenty of headroom for anyone up to about 6-2, and the seats are comfortable, if not quite top of the line. In addition, Subaru has spent a lot of time thinking about child safety features, so this thing has all kinds of built in anchor points for car seats and a shoulder harness for even the middle seat in the rear.

And now for the short list of complaints:

Subaru spent a lot of time making this things as light as they could. One result of this is that at highway speeds you can actually see the edges of the hood deflecting from wind and bumps. Not really a problem, but it is a bit unnerving at first, and the end result is a car that stops better and gets better mileage (I'm averaging around 25 miles to the gallon driving her pretty hard).

The cup holders are placed too far back in the console, especially if you have the armrest extension (the one I bought had it and it wasn't worth waiting weeks to get one that didn't), making it hard to put a cup of hot coffee into them. My old Toyota 4Runner had a much better setup, and it was built in 1991 for god's sake!

The hill holder feature on the stick shift models sounds like a great idea (it stops the car from rolling backward anytime it is in gear and the clutch is depressed, such as when you are sitting at an uphill stoplight and trying to get moving), but it takes a bit of getting used to. This thing engages even if you are on a hill that you would barely notice and you have to give it more than the usual amount of gas to overcome it and get the car moving. If I could unhook this, I would.

The indash CD changer has a random feature, but it only randomizes the tracks on 1 CD at a time. This makes no sense whatsoever in a stereo that holds 6 CDs and is something Subaru should fix immediately.

All in all I am quite pleased with the choice I made and look forward to driving it for many years to come.
