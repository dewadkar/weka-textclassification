            I just can't sit by and let so little to be written about one of America's premier cars.

First let me say this car is not owned by myself but my grandparents who have given me plenty of opportunity to drive this vehicle.  

My grandparents originally bought this car new in 1991 to replace their Dynasty.  They liked the room and luxury of this car so after I drove them to the dealer for a &quot;look&quot; they drove home in a Deville.  

The Deville impresses you with its smooth ride and instant power.  The 4.9 engine really knows how to scoot!  Don't tell them (grandparents)but I out ran a Camero in this car!  I personally drove this car on a vacation to the Smokey mountains with that V8 giving plenty of power and still got 24mpg according to the on board trip computer.

The interior deserves praise it never feels too hot or cold even with the wild hot and cold weather we see here on the Texas Gulf Coast.  I do credit the light outside color and light tan interior and upright windows.  No cracks or tears have appeared on the leather seats or dash and the overall interior can still be rated as excellent condition (the car is garaged).  Rear seat room is abundant.  All family members like the power front seats that are easy to adjust to your liking.

The exterior styling is very pleasing to look at and is rather reminiscent of Cadillacs of the fifties, or so I think.  For as large as the car is the trunk is not huge by todays standards, roomy yes, but not huge.  My grandfather likes the Deville's large door openings but I question the large lip on the trunk you have to clear to load.  Not a good car for someone with a back problem!  

Deville's tend to have some common problems and this car has not escaped all of them.  First, most Devilles I have heard of have water pump failure about every 60,000 miles so far we are on the original pump (knock on wood). One problem that came as a suprize was the failure of the brake master cylinder.  That was a exciting trip through the intersection! At 110,000 miles the a/c compressor developed a leak which I am also told is a common problem.  Even though this car is loaded down with electronics very little has gone wrong in the nine years and over 100,000 miles we have owned it.  One power window switch, ground for the starter, and (yes this is a biggy)one of the two engine computers. 

One of the most perplexing problems came from the starter ground. After leaving the car parked after driving it would not start again for about 10 minutes.  After a time we noticed this most after the car made a sharp left turn just prior to parking such as turning into a tight parking space.  Sanddollar Cadillac in Galveston TX. finally saw that the ground was comming in contact with the firewall due to the flexing of the car body.  If your Deville experiences this problem have your shop check this, it took over three visits over one year for us to figure it out!

Although I know of several people who drove their Devilles past 150,000 or 200,000 miles but I think this car will be replaced by a new Toyota Avalon while it still makes a good trade.<br><br>
