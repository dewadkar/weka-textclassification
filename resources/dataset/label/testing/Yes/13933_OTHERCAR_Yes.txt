            When my dad said that he was going to get a new car I was ecstatic! He had had his old car (a Volvo) for way too long and I had been prodding him to get a new one. Then when he said that it wasn't going to be a Volvo I wasn't as happy. After much research and deliberation he chose the Subaru Legacy Wagon. Despite the fact that it isn't a Volvo I love it! It is great to drive, handles amazingly (the all wheel drive helping even more during the winter months) and has plenty of room for transporting friends, or belongings. It is a safe car with standard dual airbags and of course the All-Wheel Drive system that has brought Subaru back as a major competitor in the market after several years of silence. If you have the extra money to spare, I would recommend the Outback model, having a slightly more powerful engine and higher clearance. That is the only complaint that I have to the Brighton model. The clearance is a couple of inches lower (which on the plus side makes it more stable and handle slightly better) but get annoying when you are parking and the front catches on a curb. The bumper can be easily banged back into place but it is just a pain. Other then that, this car is an excellent deal, and an excellent car.<br><br>
