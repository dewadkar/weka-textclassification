            We needed a useful car, but we didn't want a full size minivan, such as a Grand Caravan or Odyssey.  We initially looked at wagons, such as the Legacy, Passat and V40, but we finally decided to bite the bullet and look at a minivan. We prefer non-American cars, and the Honda was too big, as we live in an urban area.  It turns out that the MPV fit the bill perfectly: the right size (for us), upscale styling, and exceptional utility.  For those magazine reviews that say the MPV is too small and underpowered: No way! We've already moved desks and a dining room table with only the rear seat in the floor and the middle seats folded.  When we picked up the table at Pier1 Imports, we saw some poor guy taking apart his table to fit it in his Caravan because the 3rd row won't fold into the floor!

We initially looked at the DX, but it lacks ABS, tinted windows, dual air, and power features, cruise, etc.  The LX is a much better deal, and we bought through CarCostCanada, and paid $700.00 over invoice before the $750 rebate from Mazda.  Overall, the price including freight was about $26,500 CAD before tax. It lists at $29,500 CAD, and our deal was no-haggle, thankfully. Maybe we could have done better, but we're happy with that deal.

I'm not used to the lower gas mileage, as I just traded in my Protege! Plus the MPV certainly doesn't feel too underpowered after the Protege.  I recall only 3-4 years ago where 170 hp or so would be more than adequate in a minivan, why is the &quot;standard&quot; now &gt;200 hp? Search me.

I have some reservations about the durability of the Ford engine, hopefully no head gasket problems like in the Windstar, but as always, Mazda has one of the best warranties, so I'm not too concerned.

Overall, Great car!
