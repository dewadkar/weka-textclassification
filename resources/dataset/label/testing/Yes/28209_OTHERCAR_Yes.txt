            In the fall of 1998 my wife and I decided the '95 Dodge Intrepid had served us well and it was time to look for a new vehicle.  After a lot of slick convincing on my part, we decided that an SUV was on our horizon.  It didn't take long for us to determine that the Chev Blazer and Ford Explorer were to small for our comfort and besides their styling was becoming aged.  The Expedition and Suburban wouldn't fit in the garage, and along with the Tahoe, they were just to expensive.  We looked at the Dodge Durango and immediately were impressed with the roominess.  The darn thing fit in the garage right where the Intrepid had parked, and the price, albeit considerably more than the Intrepid, was at the top of our budget.  We purchased the Durango February 1, 1999.  It was a 4x4, 318 cu.in. V8 with a medium level of options.  Since then we have put on nearly 13,000 miles with absolutely no problems.  It handles well, is comfortable and tight, hauls everything we have needed hauled, and turns heads when we drive by.  There are two negatives; 1) the fuel mileage has been a pretty constant 13-15 mpg overall, with one 16 mpg on a road trip of 2500 miles.  2) With the big Tires, it gets a tad squirelly on rain drenched roads and will catch you by surprise when you hit standing water, hold on!  Other than that, we are very satisfied to date.<br><br>
