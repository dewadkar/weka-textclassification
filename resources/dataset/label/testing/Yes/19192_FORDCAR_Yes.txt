            This is the second least glamorous car I have ever owned, the first being a 1988 Ford Festiva.  But this car is truly worthy of my respect.
Most people fuss if a car doesn't have air conditioning, an automatic transmission or an AM/FM cassette.  The Aspire was never meant to be a luxurious, mileage-minded vehicle for families.  It certainly was not designed to hold playpens, a dozen pieces of luggage, a folded wheelchair or any of the other load of crap that one might cram into a sedan sized family car.  It is merely a commuter car, no bells or whistles. 
I bought my Aspire used and its a wonderful commuter car.  We've saved over $200 per month in gasoline alone (I'm not kidding here).  It shifts smoothly, brakes and handles well, has excellent visibility (except those teeny side mirrors which I find fairly useless), and is surprisingly spacious inside for such a small car.  I have no problems getting my 2 and 5 year old kids in and out of the back seats and there's enough trunk space for my husband to pack all of his work stuff. 
This car has proven itself to be exactly what it was marketed to be.  An economical, reliable little commuter car.  I'm pleased as can be with it.
