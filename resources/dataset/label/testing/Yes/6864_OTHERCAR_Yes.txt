            I bought my Elantra in May and so far it's been pretty good to me.  The only problem that I've had is with the dealership not wanting to honor the warranty.

About a month ago, every time I would hit the brakes, the whole car would shake.  I took it to a mechanic and he said that it was the master cylinder and that it should be covered under the warranty.  I made an appointment with the service department at the dealership for 7 at night.  Now that seemed odd considering they closed at 8.  How would they have enough time to fix it?  They then tried to tell me that the master cylinder wasn't covered on the warranty and they would have to charge me.  Well, I pulled out the warranty and showed them that it was covered.  I then had to make another appointment for them to fix it.  Now, I was pretty ripped because I drove 45 minutes in a car with no brakes for them to just tell me what's wrong?  Then I brought it back two days later and they tried giving me the same shpiel and I told them that it was covered, we went back and forth for awhile, but they eventually fixed it at no charge.

A week later, I get a bill in the mail for the service!!  I drove straight up there with the bill and warranty ready to just give them back the car.  But, they calmed me down and explained that it was just a computer mistake.

I think that if a company advertises this wonderful warranty they should stand behind it with pride and honor it with out any problems.  They shouldn't argue with a customer, especially when the customer has the paperwork in their hand that clearly proves them wrong.

The car is fine, but the company needs to shape up.<br><br>
