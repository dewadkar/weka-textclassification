            This camera is a dream come true for any webmaster. No more shooting, developing, scanning. I just point, shoot, pop out the disk, and voila! I have my photograph to add to my site. The camera is extremely easy to use for most features. You can truly pull it out of the box and start shooting. The only issue I have is that sometimes it is difficult to focus for close ups. You should definitely consider having a backup battery charging at all times because it does not seem to hold a full charge while in the camera, even if the camera is turned off. The mpg feature really surprised me. The specs when I purchased it claimed I could only make 15-second clips for my web site, but I have had no problems getting 30-second clips. Video quality leaves something to be desired, but it is as good as anything else on the Internet(and you aren't a slave to the congestion of Real Player). Be sure to carry lots of disks with you if you plan to shot mini movies since they do take up quite a bit of space. <br><br>
