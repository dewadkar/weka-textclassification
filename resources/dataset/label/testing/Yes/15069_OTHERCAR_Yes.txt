            My husband and I bought this camera because we had a new baby boy.  My husbands parents live 200 miles from us and we wanted to be able to take pictures of our son and email them.  This camera was recommended to us by a friend.  We like the fact that we can use a floppy disk to take the pictures.  That makes it easy to use and to be able to take the disk and give it to someone else who just has a computer.

I think if you are just wanting to take pictures with relative ease, this is the camera for you.  I comes with software to be able to share the pictures on the internet through Adobe.  That's a great feature as well<br><br>
