            I paid over $900 for my Afga 1680 when I purchased it. That's how long I've had it and continue to use it. It was my 2nd of 3 digital cameras I own, and it is still the one I use most often.

Since I run a site geared towards digital photography, I recently went looking for an additional new camera. I was pleased to see that my $900 Afga 1680 had come down in price and was being offered below $500.  Unfortunately, at the time nobody had one in stock. Even now, I suspect they're hard to find.  I looked on EBay and while I could find many of the cheap under $100 Agfa's that take garbage photos, nobody was willing to part with a 1680. I take that as a good sign for the quality of a product. If you can't find people selling it on EBay, there might be a reason why. In the case of the Agfa 1680, it's because it's a great camera.

A number of qualities make this camera stand out. It's reasonably small and even with its case, it can fit into a jacket pocket. It's pretty quick coming on when you flip to record mode. Picture processing also occurs in a reasonable time.  Optical 3X Zoom is provided and is a must feature on any camera you might consider. The 1680 also provides a unique document photo mode which works well and might make you feel like you're a secret agent. 

Two features stand out as a great reason to purchase this camera.

The photo quality is outstanding.  Even in 1280x960 mode the photo quality is such you can print an 8x10 hard copy that looks like a regular print. In it's 1600x1200 mode, it uses an extra feature that requires processing with Agfa's Photowise software. The quality in my eyes beats my 3rd camera, an Olympus D-490z which is in the same price range.

The twist body offered on the 1680 is my all time favorite feature. This allows all sorts of photographic opportunities.  It provides a means to take great shots at all levels.  I can hold the camera at waist level or raise it over my head. Great candid shots are even more possible because your subjects have no idea you're about to take the picture. My next Mega-pixel camera I purchase will have this feature.

The single most annoying fault of the 1680 is lack of viewfinder. This makes for impossible photos in dark or dimly lit situations. Many times I've had to guess the subjects of my photo were before taking a shot. In dimly lit situations the LCD screen is useless. What ever camera you decide to purchase make sure it had a viewfinder as well as an LCD screen. The viewfinder will also improve your battery life.

Additional lenses can be added like a real camera but it doesn't have a lens cap so you need to be careful and keep your lens clean.

The Afga 1680 uses SmartMedia cards. I've had good luck with them. Unfortunately, it only supports up to a 16meg card but swapping cards is easy.

I've had this camera for over a year now and it's still my favorite.
