            A few years ago my sister bought a new Nissan Altima XE after she received her Master's of Veterinary Science from Mississippi State University. She needed a new vehicle to replace her aging and fairly unreliable 1987 Chrysler LeBaron that took her through undergraduate school and beyond. She was about to embark on a two-year internship at several farms and animal hospitals throughout the US and Canada. 

She looked at several vehicles in the compact/midsize range and ultimately purchased a Nissan Altima XE for around $14,500. Her car is finished black enamel with a dark gray cloth and black interior. The XE is the base-model Nissan. It comes with a 2.4 litre SEFI transversely-mounted inline four rated at 150hp and 167 lb/ft torque at 4000 RPMs. It's mated to an optional, (for XE) 4-speed automatic transaxle with overdrive. A five-speed manual is the standard transmission. 

Mechanically, the car has been extremely reliable. My sister reported no major mechanical problems after almost 63,000 miles - fairly high compared to what I put on my vehicles. I've driven her car and it seems to have plenty of power, except perhaps on very steep inclines such as the mountain road outside my upstate Pennsylvania hometown. Even then, I didn't have to mash the throttle to the floor as I have on some 4-cylinder vehicles. The steering felt precise with little or no torque-steer effect. The car braked in fairly short distances. 

The Nissan XE comes with a lot of features for a base car - power windows, power mirrors, tilt wheel, but the seats are manually adjusted. There seems to be plenty of room up front, though the back seat seemed a little cramped when I sat back there when I rode with my Dad sitting in the front passenger seat. The base radio is AM/FM cassette, but my sister replaced it with an aftermarket unit with a ten-disc CD changer mounted in the trunk. The dashboard controls are well laid-out and the instruments are easy to read. Unfortunately it also has the stupid tach in place of a much more useful ammeter and oil pressure gauge. Why do automakers put tachometers in cars equipped with automatic transmissions anyway. Also, like too many other cars flat blacks and grays dominate the instrument panel and the rest of the interior. I can't wait for the day that we return to the more colorful interiors of the 50s and 60s. A little more fake wood and chrome accents would help. The chrome Nissan "hamburger" logo on the steering wheel breaks up the monotony a little. The HVAC system worked well, but I felt it was a little slow to cool the car, though this could be due to the car's black interior. 

The interior materials were a little disappointing. I was expecting a Nissan to use material superior to that of domestics, but I found it the same as in my Dad's 1997 Mercury Mystique. The black steering wheel was exhibiting a slight milky white haze. 

Also, like too many base vehicles, my sister's Altima had the tacky flat gray plastic wheel covers, though the chrome Nissan logo made them look a little upscale of other makes' plastic wheel covers. If a car has to have wheelcovers in place of real alloy wheels, make them out of stainless steel and use a more imaginative design instead of the fake sport-wheel look. Nobody's fooled. The GLE's alloy wheels are sharp and do wonders for the car's appearance. 

The trunk has a low liftover and provides plenty of space for her veterinary equipment and luggage despite the space eaten by the CD changer. It looks shallow but it's deep. Best of all, Sis' Nissan has, get this, A FULL-SIZE SPARE! Hallelujah!

The worst aspect of this Nissan is its paint. My sister cleans and maintains her car fairly well, but the clear coat is flaking off in dime-sized chunks on the slat grille and has a slightly oxidized look overall which I find bad for a four-year old car. Has anybody else experienced this with their Nissan?

Another problem she had was that windshield cracked badly for some unknown reason. It was replaced and paid for under her insurance.

All and all my sister is very happy with her car. If somebody wants a modest car in the compact/midsize range, the  Nissan Altima would make a good choice.
