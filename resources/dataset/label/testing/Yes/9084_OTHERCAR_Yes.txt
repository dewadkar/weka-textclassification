            This is the second Sportage I've owned (I also had a '97). Kia has made considerable improvements over their previous model years and fixed little annoyances like the spare tire lock, adding a center console and relocated the cup holders. In the three years I've been driving them, I can tell you that it handles like a champ in the rain and snow, and actually out-performs my buddies Pathfinder when we go four-wheeling (although it could really use another inch or two in clearance). The little 4 cyl engine is missing highway pickup, but is geared more for power while off road (and it CAN tow a Pathfinder out of a ditch pretty easily). You should be aware, it's a little bit of a rough ride, but remember it's a small truck, not a luxury car. The '99 Sportage isn't a Durango, but for the price, it's still much better than the other mini SUV's on the market.
