            She's still running strong!! I've had mine for 5 years ( bought it used) and it has 139,000 on it. I love the way it handles ( like a car). The body holds up very well and I live in an area with salt on the roads almost half the year. I have a small surface rust spot on the back that you really  can't see and that's the best I've seen for a 7 year old vehicle in these weather conditions. As far as repair bills I would say I've spent $2,000. total including oil changes etc. The two things I would improve on my van would have to be the heating system (needs more power) and windshield wipers (they need replacing more often than I would like).Don't get me wrong these two items work just fine, I just think there's room for improvement.
My best friend bought a Caravan around the same time I bought my Villager and I still have mine!! She had major problems with hers and it is long gone but like I said my Villager is still running strong!!<br><br>
