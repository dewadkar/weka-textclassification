            I purchased my Taurus wagon at 60k miles.  A very roomy, comfortable car.  But MAN, I get tired of the repair bills.  When I bought it, a new trans had already been installed.  Poor transmissions in Fords are legendary, every 60k or so they break down.  I replaced the trans at 120k (right on the 60k failure mark) for $2,300 (MAJOR Ka-ching!).  The steering was sloppy and tie rods were replaced.  A/C 'connectors' are poorly designed (according the a/c experts I ran into), hence recharging the a/c bi-yearly (ka-ching, ka-ching).

Had to drop and repair the gas tank due to cracked stress point.

This year (Y2k) has seen the following:

Died in the desert; started missing, then died.  Towed 75 miles home (ka-ching).  Replaced rotor, wires, etc. (admit the dist. rotor was in BAD shape).  Still not sure WHAT caused it to die.

Just recently at 140k, the head gasket blew.  It also failed the smog check because the timing is way off (55 degrees), but runs fine.  Mechanic thinks the balance (round thingy with the timing marks on it) may have slipped but WHO knows (I hate those issues!).

I have probably $5-6k in repair bills into this car, a total of $12k invested.  I may give in based on the blown head gasket and timing issue (and get another car), but the wagon has been excellent overall due to comfort and roominess, but sucked big time on repairs.<br><br>
