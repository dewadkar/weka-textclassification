            I recently purchased a 1999 VW Passat and I actually feel as though I got a lot of car for my money.  This car handles great, has plenty of horse power (I bought the turbo) and is very luxurious without the luxury car price tag. Before buying the Passat I test drove a BMW 528i and fell in love with it.  I did not, however, want to pay that kind of money for a car.  The Passat was the only car I found that was about the same size as the 528i and had that European look and feel without that enormous price tag. I recommend this car to anyone who wants a mid-priced car that isn't as mainstream as, for example, a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. One more thing...I highly recommend buying the Tiptronic Transmission which basically allows you to operate the vehicle as an automatic or a standard.  The manual transmission mode makes the vehicle drive like a sports car.<br><br>
