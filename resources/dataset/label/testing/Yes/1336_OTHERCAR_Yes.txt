            The 1999 Chevy Silverado Trucks have to be by far one of the best ever made.  Although the new styling is not favored by everyone (including yours truly) it is more than made up for with comfort and power.  I have a V6 SWB TX/OK package equipped Silverado.  The TX/OK pkg. includes A/C, carpeted floor, Tow/Haul pkg., chrome bumpers and grill, chrome steel wheels, black body side moldings, and bench seat.  Both me and my brother have the same truck except mine has cruise.  We are both college students and mainly use our trucks for going around school, work and and around town.  The V6 gets great gas mileage, right at 17.2 MPG in the city on mine with a 3.42 rear-end.  We towed a 1970 Chevelle with my brother's truck and it never missed a beat.  You would never imagine a V6 could be so powerful and so smooth, even while pulling a car behind it.  My brother's truck has a FACTORY 3.73 rear-end in it and it will literally burn the tires at a stand still on dry pavement.  The truck around town and on country roads handles very well.  The truck does have some body roll but since it is so small it is almost fun to pull some G's out of the truck around a turn.  The interior is nicely equipped with everything laid out very well.  Even the factory AM/FM Cass. stereo 4 speaker is pretty impressive.  As far as looks go, if you are wanting a truck that looks like it is ready to go into the new millenium, this is it.  Personally, I like the '88-97 body style.  To me, a truck should be a little square since it is a work vehicle and not to meant to be pranced around in.  Most importantly this Silverado is a great buy!  Mine was right at $18,500 after TT&amp;L.  You are getting a solid reliable truck that will give you many years of enjoyment.   <br><br>
