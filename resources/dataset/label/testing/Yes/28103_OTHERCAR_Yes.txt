            We own the Polaroid PDC-700 Digital Camera, and really like it. It comes in a package deal. It includes the camera, batteries, computer attatchments, and software so you can do things with the pictures you take. For example, you can make a web page with this software, make t-shirts, posters, etc. 

This camera is good for a reliable, inexpensive way to take pictures. It is small enough so you can fit it in pratically anything, instead of having a huge camera and have to lug it around. I recommend this camera to anybody. I am very satisfied with it, and am planning on getting the step up to this model. 

If you are looking for a digital camera, but don't have thousands, the Polaroid PDC-700 is perfect.<br><br>
