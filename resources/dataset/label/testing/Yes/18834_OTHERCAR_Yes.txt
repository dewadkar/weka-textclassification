            I have been very pleased with my purchase of this model Panasonic Camera.  I reviewed other digital cameras and found none that satisfied my desire for more storage capacity.  With memory cards usually costing $80 for other cameras, and then only being able to store a small number of photos, I was amazed at the capacity of this camera's memory.  With the super floppy drive, you can store hundreds of shots, depending on the quality you choose.  

I usually upload my shots to SnapFish and have them print them for me after I have edited them.  They have turned out great!  I love the ability to share pictures with family and friends immediately after taking them.  It is very easy to transfer photos to your computer for permanent storage.  (Just keep the book handy at first until you get the hang of everything.)  The camera can be used for slide show shots or action video and sound can be recorded with all types of pictures.  

This camera is really easy to use and I allow my 8 and 10 year old daughters to take pictures with it.  The viewer shows you just what you are getting in your shot.  It has a 'super' zoom feature that enabled me to take pictures at swim meets this summer from the opposite end of the pool from my little swimmers.  

Another really great feature of this camera is it's ability to be used as a zip drive for your computer.  Replacement disks run about $12 each in packs of three.  I am really looking forward to being able to use this to keep my data backed up.

The battery recharges very quickly and lasts longer than necessary, usually.  I did run it down after a day at the zoo with lots of zooming in and out for shots.  Those special effects use more power.

I bought my camera at Office Max for $499 and received a $100 rebate along with a free photo printer valued at $99, so basically got the camera for $300, although I probably would not have bought the printer otherwise at this time.  I have friends that insist I would enjoy printing my own photos but I have been waiting until we get our home office finished before I start trying that.  (Too crowded now!)

The only complaint I could possibly have about this camera, and it would apply to all digitals, is the delicate nature of them.  I wish I had thought to put it on one of my charge cards so it would have one of those fool proof guarantees in case someone drops it.  As it is, I make sure I protect it and keep it in the case when it isn't in use.

06/08/02  Still enjoying using this camera.  We have taken thousands of pictures with it.  I use online photo services to have prints made, often 5X7 or larger.  I have filled most of my picture frames and albums!  It is great being able to edit pictures instead of being stuck with what you took with a regular camera.  
I love the viewfinder so I can take shots of the kids at events without standing in front of people.  I just raise the camera high enough to clear the heads of those in front of me, adjust and click!  I can see right away if I got the shot I was after.
Now I am really wanting a digital movie camera!
