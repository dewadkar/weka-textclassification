            My 1993 Dodge Intrepid ES four door sedan was purchased because I consider dodge to be a trusted vehicle, and because I loved the features of the car.  I also love the comfortable seats, the ample head space, leg room, and the extra large trunk capacity.  I also love the sporty lines of the exterior.  I have two teenage daughters who are very proud of this car, their friends all consider it &quot;cool!&quot;  Even today it's looks are modern and up to date.  As for driving, it handles well on the road, corners well, and has a smooth running engine.  I have had no repair problems and have only had routine care done such as oil changes.  I would definitely recommend this car for comfort and style, as well as the way it runs. <br><br>
