            I had my 1993 Charade GTTi 1.0 litre turbo 12v for around 6 months.
It was a truly great little car, and out of the many cars I have owned, this is my favorite to date.
It was really fast and the engine noise sounded great even though its just a one litre. I've had many other turbo cars but none that were quite this fun.
It is very small which added to the feel of speed, but there was plenty of room in the front as the car is quite wide, although rear room is limited.
I'm generally not a fan of Daihatsu and almost didn't buy the car because of the manufacturer and their reputation of unreliability and poor build quality. This was one of the last ever charades (old model) and they seem to have sorted out all the problems.
One problem though is rust. Check the rear wheel arches, that is where they go first. Even my 93 model was just starting. The metal is very thin and once rust starts, its very hard to get rid of.
Mine had full electrics and I had no problems with them.

They are not highly deirable cars, so you can get a cheap price.
I would always get the newest model you can afford.

I was very happy with mine, and I want another.
The main problem is that they are getting very old and are rusting away, so finding a good one would be hard.

Find a post 1990 model with full history and if there is little or no rust, buy it. Otherwise, its probably better off not buying it.<br><br>
