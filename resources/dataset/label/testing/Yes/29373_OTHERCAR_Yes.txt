            The first time I saw the Honda CRV at the Chicago Auto Show in 1997, I new this would be my next &quot;car&quot;.  I had an Infinity G20, which I adored, but new that I wanted my next &quot;car&quot; to be sportier.  I am not in the least disappointed in the CRV.

The cargo space and flexibility alone, is worth the money. Now if I see some landscaping that I want to buy (to add to my rose collection, for instance), I do not have to wait until I can get a friend to put it in their truck. The CRV offers spontaneity that my Infinity could never give me. 

We travel quite frequently by car and the CRV has gotten us through all kinds of weather and has allowed us to carry cargo and kids.

There is no one who could not benefit from driving this vehicle. I highly recommend it.
