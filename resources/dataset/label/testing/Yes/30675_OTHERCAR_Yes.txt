            Ok, to begin, my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee is the TSI model, a limited edition Jeep, which was only produced for about 8mos, from mid 97 to around mid 98.  These are awesome Jeeps, and probably a collectors item. The stock sound system is fairly strong, (infinity gold), and reproduces the music about as good as anything short of a Nakamichi system in a Lexus GS300, or a Bose in a Cadillac or Audi. Handling in this car is not really up to par for what i wanted, but the best short of the BMW X5.  Also the 5.2 liter, optional v8, really kicks some rice burner a$$, and basically every other 4wd SUV and truck...ok so not an X5, or a Saleen Explorer, but you get the point.  Hehe...this SUV tops out at 125, which is good enough to hang right in with every BMW except the M cars, and 540i 6speed.
The seats in the Jeep are very comfortable and supportive, and the heated seats option is really nice as well, 1 because its nice to have a warm tushy, and 2 because without it, I couldnt have put in my custom sound system that needed alot of bass without the 130amp alternator provided with the heated seats...most hondas only have 30amp alternators...not real good, but gets the job done, compared to German cars with 90amp ones. These allow for more powerful headlights, ignition systems, sound systems, heated seats...anything electronic.  As far as off road goes in this Jeep, i have gotten it up 65 degree slopes, and tranversed some pretty sketchy sections, with rocks, and shallow creeks.  Snow performance in this vehicle is top notch, and the quadra-trac transmission wont allow you to peel out...and it CANNOT be fooled!! It is an awesome transmission that can vary the torque from 0-100% on a per wheel basis, to give you optimal traction off road, and wet/muddy ground. Overall this Jeep has been great, and repairs minimal. Only scheduled maintenance has been done, and a 35 dollar vacuum leak repaired.  see you on the road!
