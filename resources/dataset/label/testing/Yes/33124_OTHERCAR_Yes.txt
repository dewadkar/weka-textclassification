            My husband and I had our first child in November and needed something bigger than our Chevy Cavalier. We had been looking at Malibu ever since my father leased one the year before and so decided after much searching and looking around, that it was the perfect car for us. The great thing about this car is the size. I love how roomie its trunk is especially since I'm hauling around baby stuff and a huge stroller. The backseat can comfortably fit three full size adults or four smaller people. (There are only seatbelts for three people though) 

One drawback that is very minor about this car style is that the back doors are &quot;slow&quot; to close. It is very annoying when you're taking the baby out of the car and the groceries and trying to get everything inside and you hit the door with your hip and it won't close completely. I'm used to cars where you tap the door and it slams shut. This you have to push hard to get to latch completely. Its a very minor problem though. 

Overall, this car is roomier to drive than most I've experienced. The seat belts don't cut into your neck and are completely adjustable which is a very nice feature. The steering wheel moves even on the &quot;scaled down&quot; model that we got. When I'm driving I have enough speed and pick up to feel confident without being power driven. The car gets good gas milage too which is important right now with the prices so high. I feel that we have picked a safe car for our family that has wonderful benefits. 

The people I think would fit this car best would be anyone! Young people, older people, family types, single types, everyone would love this car!<br><br>
