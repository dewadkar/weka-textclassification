            My family bought this car about a year and a half ago, and its been nothing but fun. This car is extremely roomy and has a lot of power from its 256 horsepower V-6. I think the interior is absolutly beautiful and my opinion is its better looking on the inside then most other luxery cars, like Cadillac and Lincoln. So far their has been no problems at all beside a headlight went out which is really nothing. I'd say the only thing that could be better on this car, would be the headlights, their not real bright. 
The comfort this car gives is great, with the huge back seat and powered front seats. The ride is also very rewarding, very smooth and soft. I also love the feel of the steering system, it feels very firm and precise. I would also like to mention the safety of this car. It has dual front air bags and ABS, and just a very well built, quit riding car.
