            Just getting ready to purchase my 5th Jeep, my last one was a 1997 TJ. I find that nothing else is as much fun to drive around town and on gravel covered back roads. Highway driving is acceptable but noisy with the soft-top. 

For me the 5 speed manual, soft-top and half doors is the only way to go. I don't find the lack of a hard-top in the winter a problem, and I live in Canada. It is garaged at night and during the day snow does not really stick to the back window, therefore rear visibility is not a major concern.

I really enjoy being able to remove the top half of the doors completely, leaving a perfect spot to rest my elbow when driving. And on really nice summer days, when no rain is forecast the complete door assembly lifts right off, and then it becomes my Harley-Davidson with 4 wheels. 

The negatives are that it is made by Chrysler ... or Daimler now... and it still has annoying quality problems. Look at any brand new TJ on the dealers lot and the front horn under the bumper that is visible form 15' away is already rusted. They have always had problems with paint flaking from side mirrors after a few years, it was a problem on my 1997 and I noticed that nothing changed on a 1999 that my dealer has on the lot.

If it is being used for commuting, or as a primary family vehicle it is not well suited to that task. With teenagers driving it, extreme care must be taken, the short wheel base can make emergency handling and tipping a real concern. For baby boomers such as myself it is the ideal toot around town 4x4.

Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any further questions regarding options to order etc. Thank you for reading this.    

P.S. The other negative opinion on this Jeep is very well written, so I felt no need to repeat what is said there. Jeeps are a personal like/dislike more then anything else... as the ads say "it is a Jeep thing". All the comparison stats and tech info has no great bearing on this unique 4x4 ... it is just plain fun for those that like them and annoying for those that purchased a Jeep just because they are a bit trendy.
