            If you are looking for a compact digital camera that can take great quality digital photos. Stop reading this review and go buy the Casio Exilim EX-S3. 

The minute you hold this camera in your hands you will be blown away by it's size. It is actually the size of a credit card and thin. It can slip in your shirt or trouser pocket with room to spare for your key. 

Turning on the camera is equally impressive. The large 2 inch TFT screen. Simply bueatiful LCD with easy to navigate menu. I know because I have yet to read the owner's manual. 

What about the picture quality? Simply Beautiful. With the exception of one or two of the photos I took, the picture quality is really good. Remember this is a 3.2 mega pixel camera, more than enough for publishing on the web and adequate enough to print to photo paper. 

Another selling feature is its removable media. Supports SD (Secure Digital) cards. I bought 128 MB card for like $90. The extra media comes in handy when you want to shoot a couple of small video clips. It is unbelievable how smooth the video played back on the 2 inch LCD display. All video is stored in AVI format. All photos are web ready and stored in JPEG format. 

I'm honestly sitting here trying to give you the dirt on this camera but I'm coming up blank. Casio has truly engineered the near perfect slim digital camera. There is one thing that does not sit well and it's the camera's rechargeable battery. I can see myself ready to take the picture of the year and there's no juice left! I guess I will have to buy an extra battery and keep it charged and in the car! 

If you are like me and itching to get rid of that bulky digital camera you bought last year, then buy the Casio Exilim EX-S3. This is one purchase you will not be sorry about.
