            The Pontiac Vibe is a useful and modern design. The modern 1.8 liter 4 cylinder engine is well designed and feels great. I just gave up my 1983 Honda accord with a 1.8 liter engine, and it is nice to see so many improvements with the same size of engine. I love the way the engine sounds and the way it powers up hills and passes cars. When the engine goes all out, you know it. Great fun. It is the perfect balance of power and gas mileage. I am getting better mileage with new Vibe than I was my old Honda. Who would have thought that possible? The Vibes quick engine is under tight control, thanks to great handling. I have always disliked the way large vehicles corner. Pickups, Vans, and Suv, have always felt tippy while cornering. That was one reason I chose a lower vehicle with the same functionality.  The vibe really hugs the road and feels pretty good in a corner.   When parking and turning I am always amazed by the small turning radius, and power assisted steering makes it a breeze. The power steering is not too much as to make you loose your feel of the road.  However, watch out extra carefully in parking lots and freeway traffic. The side visibility of the vibe is poor. Power adjustable mirrors help, but still, Look out! Traveling in high speed traffic is quiet, and comfortable inside the Vibe. I feel extra secure with front and side airbags, and ABS. The modern safety features are something you should have. The horn could be made safer, it is way too wimpy. It lets out a quiet "eeeep".  It doesn't sound appropriate for such a great car. Overall, I am impressed with the cars functionality. A mountain bike lays in the back with the back seats down. The vibe has lots of function goodies.  Tie down points, I never see myself actually using them with the tie down straps. Compartments are all over the place, I will never use.  I will probably never use the power outlets in the car.  I dream of buying a laptop and using it  with my Vibe, but I am too poor now that I bought this car. The price was surprising, and the extra features really add to the dealers price. The car is hard to find so it may limit your ability to get a good deal. Good luck even finding a base model within the next five states. You may have to settle for more options and a higher price, just to get your hands on one. Remember the GM cars from the 80's? They were really bad in my opinion.  After owning one, I am a little skeptical of the craftsman ship of the Vibe.  Some elements within the car seem a little off. I had to spray wd40 around the red Dash instruments, to stop an annoying squeek, already? However, I am sure the partnership between Toyota and Pontiac has been a learning experience and they were able to churn out a sound vehicle. We shall see. Overall, I love my Vibe. It looks Sweet!
