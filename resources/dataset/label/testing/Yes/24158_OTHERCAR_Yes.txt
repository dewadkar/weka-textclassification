            My husband and I went out one day, just browsing, for a new car.  We really didn't need one at the time, but we were bored so we thought we would just go look.  Little did we know that we would be going home with a new car. 

We looked at several lots before making our last and final stop at a Hyundai dealership.  We got out of our car and started to browse the Elantra's that were sitting out on display.  There were quite a few that caught our eyes, but we just didn't know.  Soon enough a sales person came out to assist us.  He started telling us all about the cars features and had us get in a set in it and before we knew it we were signing the papers to buy the new 2003 Hyundai Elantra.  

Well, even though buying the 2003 Hyundai Elantra was kinda spur of the moment, we are very pleased with our purchase.  The Elantra has so many neat features and they just make  you love it even more.  

Let me tell you some of my favorite features.  First it has a neat little sunglass holder on the ceiling between the two front seats. It also has a gas cap holder for when you are pumping your gas. This feature prevents the cap from falling down on your car and scratching it up...good feature.  It also has a handle in the trunk of the car (it glows in the dark) so that if someone would for some reason get stuck in the trunk of the car, they would be able to get out on their own.  On the back seat, hidden underneath, there are two cup holders that when you push a button they slide out, so your back seat passengers have somewhere for their beverages, (we've had the car 6 mo. and I just now found this feature!).  And for more cupholders, it has a cupholder in each of the front doors and it has two cupholders in the middle console and it comes with a size-a-cup cupholder so that your drink won't roll around.

Those are just a few of my favorite features of the car.  There are many other features as well, like, front and side airbags, power windows, door and mirrors, trunk and gas tank popper, safety locks in the rear doors, rear defrost, delayed windshield wippers, many little cubby holes, comfy seats and a very roomy inside.  And one other key thing is it gets really good gas mileage. 

This car is definitely worth every cent that we paid for it.  So if ever you need a new car, dont' be afraid to stop by the Hyundai Lot and give a new Elantra a test drive!
