            For the past decade or so I've made my living as a courier, delivering small packages in and around the Twin Cities area. When I look for a car, the first things I pay attention to are gas mileage, cargo capacity, and ease of maintenance.

Saturn was not really a brand name I was thinking of before I purchased this car. It was brought to my attention by an Internet car-buying site that listed the Saturn SW2 among several other models as having the qualities I was looking for. Further surfing brought to light a used one available at a local Nissan dealership for what seemed a good price (it helped that the first wave of zero-percent financing had flooded the used car lots and depressed their prices). It's even silver, so it looks just like the photo at the top of this heading.

How it rates according to my major criteria:

Gas mileage: generally good, usually mid- to high-thirties. I had hoped for a little better from a five-speed manual. A Mercury Tracer hatchback with a five-speed manual I once had would hit the low forties on occasion. But the SW2 has a lot of accessories such as power steering and air conditioning that the Tracer did not, so perhaps that accounts for it.

Cargo capacity: with the fold-down rear seats, usually adequate for what I want it for. Surprisingly, although the SW2 is larger on the outside than my 1994 Ford Escort wagon, it has less cargo capacity on the inside. The distance between the rear wheel wells in particular is smaller, meaning some items that can fit flat in the Escort must ride tilted in the SW2.

Ease of maintenance: anything I can do means I can save a bit of money. But I'm not a mechanical wizard; changing spark plugs is about as complicated as I'm willing to deal with. The SW2 is something of a mixed bag for the do-it-yourself-er. Some things are easy, some are oddly difficult.

Let's start with something really common: cleaning the windows while fueling up. Unlike the Tracer or the Escort, which had their extensible radio antennas mounted in the driver's side windshield pillar, the SW2 has a fixed radio antenna mounted on the passenger side front fender. This makes it somewhat more difficult to clean the passenger side of the windshield. As for the rear window, it turns out that the rear windshield wiper <i>cannot</i> be lifted up enough to clean under it. It is impossible to completely clean the rear window. It's not just this particular vehicle; I was so astounded I went to a Saturn dealership and tried another SW2. Nope; they're all like that. They must have a reason for that, but I couldn't tell you what it is.

Another thing that's difficult about that rear windshield wiper is replacing it. The front wipers are easy, the limited clearance of the rear makes it quite hard (in fact, I still haven't managed it).

The air filter is quite easy. It's placed right up at the front of the engine compartment. Its cover is held on with four snaps, easy to undo and easy to snap back on. Easiest replacement I've ever experienced.

Changing the spark plugs is also the easiest I've ever experienced. They are mounted on the top of the engine, and there is nothing blocking them. They are unusually well-protected by their ignition wires, which completely fill and seal the spark plug wells.

Too bad I don't need to do those things very often. Changing the oil is the most difficult of any vehicle I've owned. The first problem is that there doesn't seem to be a natural jack point. There is a jacking rail for use when changing a flat tire, but a hydraulic jack just crumples that. I've changed oil around ten times and still haven't found a spot I like enough to want to use it again. I dunno, maybe I should use ramps :)

The second problem is that the oil filter, unlike the Tracer and the Escort, is not accessible from the top. Like the oil drain plug, it's only accessible from the bottom. It's also on the back side of the engine, so I have to go fairly far underneath the vehicle in order to reach it. Loosening the filter spills oil (often on me). The only good thing is that a new filter goes on very easily. Even though I can't see the connection point, it just spins on if I get it even close.

One more odd thing about changing the oil is that an "oil life" monitor needs to be reset (a switch under the hood). The monitor is supposed to turn on a light on the dashboard when the engine computer decides it's time. I don't pay attention to that. I just change oil every 3000 miles or so and reset the monitor. I've never seen it come on, but it was on when I bought the vehicle - the dealership had changed the oil, but apparently didn't know about re-setting the monitor.

I bought this vehicle with a little under 20,000 miles on it. At that time it was about a year old, so the original bumper-to-bumper warranty still applied for two more years or 16,000 more miles, whichever came first (in my case, 16,000 came <i>way</i> first). Saturn doesn't care who owns the vehicle, only about the warranty terms. The only work I had done under warranty was to fix the rear windshield defroster and - tada - rear windshield wiper (a broken relay apparently caused both problems).

At 35,995 miles the left blinker stopped blinking. At 36,016 miles I got it to a dealership. They weren't gonna be picky, but they traced the problem to an aftermarket towing hitch that the original owner had installed. Its faulty connections to the electrical system screwed up the blinker. So I had to pay for disconnecting that. The blinker works fine now, but if I ever want to tow a trailer I'm going to have to figure out a way to power its lights.

Other than those two things I've not had any mechanical problems. After 40,000+ miles I've not even had to replace the brake pads (which worries me a bit - how long can they possibly last?!).

At 40,000 miles the OEM tires wore out. They were Firestone Affinities. They were noisy, unresponsive and lasted just as long as they were guaranteed to and no longer. I wanted to replace them with BF Goodrich Control T/A's, which I like very much, but they're not made in the SW2's size (185/65 R15).

I eventually settled on Firestone Affinity LH's. The "LH" designation apparently makes them much better than regular Affinities. They certainly are quieter and have twice the guaranteed life. They also have a noticeably firmer grip on the road, even when rain or snow is present (they will slide when cornering on ice, though. They're not Blizzaks!). Handling is also improved. The SW2 now goes wherever I point it without protest.

The driver's seat is quite comfortable. The steering post is adjustable, which was a new feature for me (I re-set it to clear my knees). The dashboard instruments are laid out well and easily visible, although at night they don't always seem illuminated brightly enough (I have to turn that up every so often). It took me about a year to realize that if I pressed the small button next to the digital odometer I'd get the trip odometer reading (which does measure to tenth-miles, unlike the main odometer). The wiper switch operates in the opposite direction of my past vehicles, and I still haven't quite gotten used to it. The owner's manual is excellent: hardbound, full-color, hundreds of pages and still mostly unread (I'd have probably found out about that trip odometer a lot sooner otherwise!).

Although I'm not crazy about the sound system's controls (too many multiple-function buttons), it does sound better than any other vehicle I've owned. This vehicle came with CD- and cassette-players, which I don't believe is standard. The CD player doesn't skip, and remembers where it left off if I shut off the engine (spooky the first time it happened, but pretty cool after that!).

If this was my first car, I'd probably love it. Sometimes I feel like I ought to love it more than I do.

Then I have to change the oil again.

As it is, I like this car. I have no regrets about buying it. If Saturn was still making them, I'd be willing to buy another low-mileage used one.
