            I purchased this car in September 2002.  I was fortunate enough to purchase the car through a family member and received "A-Plan" pricing.  My Escape is the XLT Choice 2 model with FWD.  The only option I added was the Mach sound system with an in-dash 6CD player.

Compared to other vehicles in its class (Rav4, CR-V, Xterra, etc.) I think it is a good-looking car.  This is obviously a personal preference.  I think the Toyota Rav4 and Honda CR-V look small, and the Nissan Xterra is kind of ugly.  Feel free to disagree.

The main selling points for the Escape, in my opinion, are a relatively smooth drive (for an SUV), the V6 engine (not available on most other small SUVs), and the car's affordability.

I think the car drives great.  The V6 engine provides quite a bit of power.  The Escape truly handles like a car.  Many publications have said the Escape's braking distance is superior for an SUV and quite comparable to some cars.

One complaint I have heard often about the Escape is the noise.  I do not think engine noise is really an issue.  You will hear a fair amount of wind noise at highway speeds.  However, its nothing overly ridiculous (no more than any other cars Ive been in at 75-80mph).  Just turn up the radio, speaking of which..

As mentioned earlier, I had the Mach system (7 speakers)installed as my only option.  This cost me approximately $500 more and I think it is well worth it.  This system does not have a tape player which was not an issue for me, but may be for others out there.  The two front speakers sound particularly impressive.

One small point I would like to add about the Mach system.. you can see what radio station you are on as well as the time of day on the display.  Most other displays I have seen only allow one at a time to be on.

I am about 6'3" and have no problem with leg room in the vehicle.  This includes the driver/passenger seats and the back seat.

I have only owned the car about two months so far and have only put 4000 miles on it, so I can not really speak as to the reliability yet.  There were several recalls on the 2001 models (2001 was the first year for the Escape) so I think they had some "growing pains" on the assembly line that have been worked out.

My car insurance went up about $125 every six months after purchasing the vehicle.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Ford Escape and would recommend a test drive to anyone looking to buy a car/SUV.  Thanks!
