            If you are looking at a used Saturn, you should know that the 2002 L200 was a great year for that model. In 2002 the L200 came with four wheel disc brakes, a feature that the 2003 L200 lacks. The 2002 L200 boasts 137 horsepower, as opposed to 135 horsepower in the 2003 model. Additionally, the 2002 L200 gets 33 miles per gallon on the highway, with an automatic transmission, a mile improvement over the 32 MPG that the 2003 models get on the highway.

Granted, the 2003 model looks snappier than the 2002 L200, which looks like a perfect car for the witness protection program. However, the bottom line is that the 2002 is a better car at a better price! Both year models offer dent proof doors, which keep Saturns looking new longer than other cars, while also reducing insurance repair costs.

After 16,000 miles I'm still very happy with my L200. I still love the engine, which gives me great mileage, while providing ample power for the big Saturn. The 2.2-liter,Ecotec 4-cylinder makes good smooth power, putting out a very smooth 137 horsepower. I've replaced the stock air filter with a K & N air filter, which probably gives me an additional three or four horsepower. 

Maintenance: The L200's engine design will save you money. It has no spark plug wires, cap or rotor to replace! The oil filter is a cartridge type, that is built into the engine block. It is easily accessible from the top of the engine compartment. All fluids levels are clearly marked and easily accessed.

Driving Impressions: 
This is a very comfortable car to drive. The seats are fine for daily commuting and the center console works wells as an armrest. The driver's seat has a height adjustment that is manually operated by a lever on the side of the seat. The speedometer and tachometer are large analog gauges and they are easily read. Window visibility is good, but there is a blind spot in the side rear, which drivers should be aware of. The cruise controls are comfortably located on the pad in the middle of the steering wheel, on the left and right sides of the pad. All window controls are located in the center console, like the BMW. However, the window controls are rather big and clumsy to operate, unlike the BMW controls. The basic sound system has a radio and CD player, and no cassette player. The CD player is easily accessed and CD's can be stored in the empty slot below the player. 

The L200 has more road feel than most American cars. It tracks straight, without any drift. Braking is sure and efficient with the four wheel disc brakes. Road and wind noise are not noticeable in the cabin with the windows up ( This is a noticeable change from earlier models, as the 2001 L200 that I rented before buying one had substantial wind noise, even with the windows up). The Ecotec engine has more than enough power to handle the freeway speeds of southern California. The automatic transmission is smooth and efficient and the car is geared for freeway cruising. 


Buying Options:
All 2002 L Series Saturns had four wheel disc brakes, except for the L100 models. For safety, I would pick the L200 over the L100 model to get four wheel disc brakes. There was a stick shift available, but it only got one mile per gallon better than the automatic did. The L200 with an automatic is the best choice. The L300 is a six cylinder, which drinks more fuel. The engine compartment in the LS300 is crowded and more traditional, with spark plug wires, cap and rotor. 

Performance: 
Saturn L200 owners seeking more horsepower and improved gas mileage should consider installing a more efficient air filter. See the K & N link in my profile to learn more about efficient air filters. My only complaint is that Saturn uses a hinge style lid for the air filter box, which is a pain in the neck to secure.

Brakes:
Change to harder brake pads in the front calipers when you do the front brakes to cut down on the excessive brake dust. There are many excellent aftermarket pads out there, but do your own research rather than let Joe at the station just sell you his. Some of these pads need to be warmed up before they grab well, and I would shy away from those. Get the best pads that you can find and don't let cost be a factor. The cost difference between great pads and average pads is minimal and they could save your life! When you replace your front brake rotors, I recommend switching to slotted rotors. They will dissipate heat better than the stock rotors and reduce brake fade. The Saturn dealer in my town stocks, both the K & N air filters and slotted brake rotors. 

Brake Fluid:
Change the old brake fluid when you change the front brake pads. The brake fluid can collect moisture and dirt. Brake fluid also lubricates the pistons in the calipers, which extends caliber life (I never had to replace a caliper in my life and I had over 217,000 on my last car, a 1986 BMW 325E. BTW, I nailed a door and the insurance company totaled my BMW, so I opted for a new car with an air bag. The motor was still great!).

Tires:
Change to performance all season tires when you replace the Firestones. This upgrade in tires will not only improve the car's handling, but also make it a safer car. The tires don't have to cost you an arm and a leg. My first choice for replacement tires are the Dunlop SP A2's. They run around $58 a tire and they will definitely improve the Saturn's handling, outperforming the Michelin MXV4's on dry or wet roads! The Bridgestone Potenzas are my second choice and they should wear a little longer than the Dunlops. For best mileage, I recommend staying with the standard tire size 195-65-15. Lower profile, wider tires hug the corners better, but their larger footprint and slightly shorter diameter will definitely hurt you at the gas pump! 

Switch to a Fully Synthetic Oil:
Saturn dealerships allow you to change your own oil in their service bays, which will save you the cost of the standard oil change. Take the money that you save and use it to purchase a good synthetic oil. Resetting the oil change indicator is a breeze and no tools are needed. Saturn uses a cartridge oil filter, that is very easily accessed from above. The drain plug on the Saturn takes a 15 mm socket, but the oil filter cap takes a special socket tool, which Saturn service mechanics always lend me for the oil change.  While you are under the car take a look around. Check out your brakes pads and rotors.

Cautionary Note on Synthetic Oils:
When you have synthetic oil in your engine you may think that your oil is 1/4 quart low and end up overfilling your engine. Follow the manual and put in 5 qts of synthetic oil the first time.  However, the next time you change your oil put in 4 3/4 quarts of synthetic. Then check the oil level again in the morning when the engine is cold. You should be exactly full. Mobil 1 clings to engine parts and I suspect that most synthetics do, as well. No sense blowing a gasket needlessly. 

Use Extended Oil Changes After Your Warranty Runs Out:
Car manufacturers make no allowances for synthetic oils when they provide their maintenance schedules, so change your oil when the light comes on (the L car has an counter that tallies engine revolutions). However, once your warranty runs out you can safely run a good synthetic oil 12,000 miles, instead of changing it every 3,000 miles. This extended schedule will save you money and it's better for the environment. If this worries you, you can change it at 6,000 or 7,000 miles and the environment will still benefit from your longer oil change intervals. For those folks that need convincing, please not that Mercedes and Jaguar now indicate the first oil change for their vehicles are at 12,000 and 9,000, respectively. The reason for this is that they both vehicles come factory filled with synthetic oil.

Visits Back to the Dealer:
I have had several visits to the dealer but never for anything major. A glob of grease saturated one of the window roller pads, so the dealer replaced the window roller pads .Most people wouldn't even notice this. One of the rear window trim strips started to separate slightly from the body, so that was replaced. At 5,000 miles the ignition cylinder had to be replaced, as it would lock my steering wheel (a common General Motors problem). 

Other Issues:
My only two issues with the big Saturn are the soft paint and the vehicle's blind spot. The soft paint scratches and chips too easily. The blind spot is a major safety concern and all prospective buyers of this vehicle need to remember this if they purchase this vehicle.

Please Let Me Take My Car Back to the Dealer:
Going to the dealer has always a rather pleasant experience for me. I visit with other Saturn owners, have a cup of hot chocolate and they wash my car. However, I hadn't had a single reason to go back to the dealer, other than to change my oil, since 5,000 miles. I was searching for an excuse to go back when I realized that my dash trunk release didn't operate. Finally I was taking my Saturn back to the dealer. Unfortunately, I they found the problem in less than a minute, denying me my pleasant Saturn dealer experience! How dare they! The valet switch on my trunk was on. Oh well, there is always next year.

Mechanics' Choice:
I should mention that the Saturn mechanics I know also prefer the 4 cylinder Ecotec engine over the 6 cylinder engine. The Ecotec is easier to work on than the 6 cylinder and gets pretty good gas mileage. 

Summing it up:
The Saturn L200 represents great used value for a family car. The  engine should provide many carefree driving miles. 

Bugs in earlier year L cars:
If you are seriously considering buying any L series Saturn, you should find the link in my profile very helpful. It provides a brief history of L series reliability problems and their solutions. The site is maintained, but bear in mind that the author is a Saturn salesman. 
 
Good luck shopping and comparing cars. Remember that newer is not always better, especially if you are comparing a 2003 L200 with a 2002!
