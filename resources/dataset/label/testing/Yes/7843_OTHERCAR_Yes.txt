            i love my dads rodeo. he let me borrow it for the weekend because i was driving a few friends up to HSU. it has so much room and the seats are really comfortable. i was driving a '97. it comes with a great sound system in it too...with tweeters up front, side door 3ways, and 6&quot; woofs in back. the back seats fold forward for tons of room. i remember sleeping back there once when i was at the lake...very roomy! also, with a standard V-6, this baby can get up and go pretty quick...it also has two neat driving options...there's power drive that delays shifting for maximum output and horsepower...for those narrow roads where you're stuck behind a grandma driver and you're late for a movie...and it also has winter driving...this uses the clutch to start out in 2nd gear...this dramatically decreases the start off punch which increases starting traction on those wet and icy days. i definitely recommend the rodeo for someone seeking a great SUV with a relatively low price, low maintainance, and long lasting.<br><br>
