            So I don't know anything about cars. That's okay. I know what I like. And I like the 2002 Kia Sportage. No--wait--I love it. The love affair started a few weeks ago when I decided I wanted a 4 wheel drive SUV. I also knew I didn't have much money. So I went to the internet and started comparing features. One thing that's very important to me, as someone who doesn't know much about cars, is how the vehicle looks. And this one looks good.

By the time I went to the dealer I already knew I was going to buy one, the question was when. If I didn't get a good deal, I couldn't buy that day and would have to wait a while. Delayed gratification isn't my cup of tea, so I wanted to leave the dealership with the Kia.

The absolute have-to-have list included: air conditioning, cd player, and automatic windows and locks. On my wish list was remote keyless entry. For $100 more I got a remote starter as well. Wow. Way too cool to turn down this offer. I got everything I wanted--including a CUTE vehicle that matched my eyes, slate blue. Of course, that's what everyone desires in a car, unless of course your car and eyes are red.

The only downside--so far--is that I can't put much in the glove compartment. Even the owner's manual won't fit. Luckily there's a little storage area on the door where the owner's manual fits nicely.

I really wanted a 4 wheel drive SUV because I live in the frozen north. Of course, this year we haven't had snow yet, so I'm stuck in the 2 wheel drive position. But, boy oh boy, will I ever be prepared when it does snow--in my 4 wheel drive Kia Sportage that matches my eyes.
