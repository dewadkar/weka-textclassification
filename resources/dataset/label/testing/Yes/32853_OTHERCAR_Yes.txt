This camera is AMAZING. After owning it for only one day I already feel like I can navigate any of it's functions without the need for the manual. Here is a quick outline of what I feel are it's shining features and tragic flaws.

UNBEATABLE FEATURES:

1. The camera features an outstanding button layout and well planned software that is easy to learn and a joy to navigate.

2. Scene Mode - You can choose preset auto settings for virtually any environment. These include: Portrait, Indoor/Party, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Sunset, Snow/Beach, Fireworks, Close-up, Backlit, and Copy. 

3. Quick Play Mode - The ability to quickly see the photo you just shot without a hassle or long wait. No other camera I know of offers anything similar to this!

4. Movie Mode - Go into the continuous shooting menu and choose "movie" in order to record up to 40 seconds at a time (Quicktime Format). In my experience a 40 second movie is approximately 11mb. This will eat your standard 8mb card in no time flat so plan to buy something larger. The downside of the movie mode is that you need good external lighting.

5. This package is so strong I cannot foresee myself needing another digital camera for a long time. That makes the $650 well spent.

TRAGIC FLAWS:

1. With quickness comes high power consumption (with the LCD on). This really is not a tragic flaw if you are prepared. I use an external rechargeable power supply that costs ~$30. You have to deal with a cable dangling from the camera to your battery but the costs savings are worth it.

2. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery is a splendid accessory but with the charger (which doubles as an AC power supply) you are out another $100. Ouch.

3. The 8mb compact flash card is ridiculously small. Bite the bullet and buy the largest card you can afford.

4. If you own other Nikon flashes you cannot use them with the 880. Well it can't have every option the 990 offers, right?

5. Does not come with an AC adapator. Why the market has standardized on this I cannot explain. I would rather pay a bit more and get the whole package.

6. The movie mode attracted me but after using it a bit I am not that excited anymore. The final product viewed on your computer is much darker than it appears on the LCD. It really needs to be brightly lit to get good results. The worst part is that the camera is constantly refocusing as it records, making for a very choppy movie. Lastly, I wish the movie mode was MPEG rather than quicktime. I am more familiar with MPEG and not sure what to use to edit quicktime movies.

CLOSING:

I am foaming at the mouth I am so happy with this camera. At this pricepoint I wouldn't recommend anything else. Enjoy.
