            <b>Basics</b>
For those of you in the entry-level Sport Sedan market, you know you are limited in the amount of cars you can chose from.  Not only does this make the purchase decision harder, but it also makes your research even more important.  The more you know about each car the better.  With that in mind, I would like to introduce to you, the 2000 Audi A4 1.8T.  

Lets start with the basics: Front wheel drive (with an EXCEPTIONAL Quattro option available), 4 door sedan, with either the &quot;base&quot; 1.8L Turbo engine, or the &quot;optional&quot; 2.8L V6 normally aspirated engine.  For my review I will focus on the 1.8L Turbo engine as that is the engine I ended up getting.  Audi offers both a 5spd manual and a 5spd &quot;Tiptronic&quot; automatic, the later being borrowed from Porsche.  

Audi offers many pleasing and unusual/original exterior options as well as 3 distinct interior Atmospheres, all of which I recommend you view in person, in sunlight.  Colors viewed in a brochure, or viewed inside under florescence never look the same as they do in &quot;real&quot; light.

<b>Exterior</b>
For 2000 the A4 receives some very nice, yet subtle improvements over the '99 model.  Things such as updated door handles, new badge placement, new sport wheels, relocation of the fog lamps to a more eye pleasing location, revised grill and headlamp look, relocation of the window washers, redesigned side mirrors, and clear side markers.  All of these changes add up to make the A4's appearance even better than previous models.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior options are a little confusing.  Audi offers Atmospheres, which are basically interior &quot;packages&quot; that have coordinated colors that look good with the exterior color of choice.  Please see Audi USA's homepage at www.audiusa.com for more information on Atmospheres.  For the 1.8T model, you can have either a high quality cloth or decent leatherette.  I personally don't care for the leatherette because it does not breath nearly as well as cloth or even leather.  The biggest downfall here is that you can NOT get leather seats on the 1.8T.  I'm not sure why Audi chose to do this, but I personally would like to have at least had the option.

The standard seats are offered in both cloth and leatherette, are quite comfortable and have decent lumbar and lateral support.  The optional Sport Seats ($700) however, are much nicer, have an electronic lumbar adjustment, and excellent lateral support.  The Sport Seats are not offered in leatherette.  Both the standard and sport seats on the 1.8T are 8 way manually adjustable, with no option for the electronic adjustments (they are standard on the 2.8).  I would venture to say that just about <i>anyone</i> should be able to find a comfortable and ergonomically correct seating position inside of the A4.  To assist you in this, even the steering wheel tilts and telescopes so that even really long legged, short-armed people will find the perfect position in the A4.

The steering wheel stalk functions are difficult at first but becomes second nature as time passes.  Just about everything needed to control your car is available on the stalks.  The new in-dash CD player is nicely organized and easy to use as well.  Instrument lighting is also exceptional, new for 2000 is white numbering on the tach and speedometer, which makes seeing the numbers much easier than years past when everything was the same hue of red.

Rear seat room is a little cramped for 2 adults, and nearly impossible for 3.  Kids fit in the rear perfectly.

<b>The Driving Experience</b>
As if everything before this isn't good enough, driving this great auto is better yet.  With the optional Quattro (a must even if the weather where you live is sunny and dry 100% of the time) you can push this car around corners with the utmost confidence and control.  The 1.8T engine is small and peppy, revving quick enough for most people though the power band.  The peak torque at 155 ft/lb. is available as early as 2000 rpm, and stays at peak all the way to 4000 rpm.  This is due to the turbo keeping the engine running as efficiently as possible.  Now for all of you turbo skeptics, this small one (putting out around 7psi max) and is quite reliable.  In the nearly 4 years the 1.8T engine has been available very few problems have occurred regarding the turbo. 

<b>Final assessment</b>
To tell you the truth, I was surprised to find the quality of the car, quantity of the standard features, and ride of the A4.  Before I bought mine, I had very little interest in Audi's, but after my investigation, I found that not only does the A4 suit me perfectly, Audi carries a car to fit just about anyone's needs.  I am very pleased with the service and treatment so far.  Not only is just about everything service related free (everything but tires), but its all been taken care of quickly and with courtesy.

If you have any other questions, I suggest you check out A4.org at www.a4.org, it's an excellent site dedicated to the A4 (the forum section is especially helpful).
