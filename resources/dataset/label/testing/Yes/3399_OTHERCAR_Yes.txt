                 I recently bought (used) a 1997 Nissan Quest.  After a 3 year nightmare with my last vehicle (the review is listed in the Kia section) it is great to be back in a Nissan.  This car has a very smooth ride and is quite comfortable.  Putting in a lot of time on the road, I have also been very pleased with the vehicles gas mileage.  
     The interior is very spacious and I have had no problems accomodating both family and cargo.  It's filled with many small amenities such as arms rests, reclining seat, cup holders and my favorite, back seat air controls.  
     There are only a few cons that I have found so far.  The rear hatch can be kind of tricky.  It doesn't always close all the way.  Even when I think I've got it, the cabin sensor indicates an open door.  then I have to get out and make sure it's closed.  The vehicle sometimes seems to lack power on the highway, though putting it into overdrive quickly remedies this.  The last con is the headrest.  While having a comfortable seat, the headrest seems a bit far back for comfort.  Thus I don't use the headrest often.
     Other than those few small things, I think the Quest is a very nice, spacious, fuel efficient and fun vehicle to drive.  I can hardly wait to take it cross country!
