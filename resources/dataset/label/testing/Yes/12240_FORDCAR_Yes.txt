            The Ford has always been a BIG influence in my life ever since birth practically. I've always lived around Ford trucks and my Father has owned one Ford after another all his life. Being that I've always been around them and grew up with them, I LOVE them! I honestly think that Ford trucks are built better and look better than any other truck out there. Ford trucks are the best selling trucks and have been for many years. The day I found my 1994 Ford Ranger was the day that I bought the best truck I've owned so far. I have owned a 1983 Ford Ranger and a 1987 Nissan before the 1994 Ranger but they didn't compare to this truck. I paid $6,000 for my truck in 1998 and it was the first day that I started looking for a newer truck and the truck had just been bought by the dealer from a bank that had repo'd it from someone. It looked brand new and still does today because I take good care of it. The paint is as new as the day it was made. It is Cayman Green. I love the grey interior and it's a 5 speed manual transmission which shifts smoothly and really nice and is an XLT package which comes with air conditioning. It has manual window handles for raising and lowering the windows and I like manual better than the power ones. It has a back sliding glass window (2 piece) that opens up to let in the fresh air in the summer. It has a really nice stereo system with good bass and good heat and air and well as really comfortable seats. The only bad thing to me is that most of the time, it's kinda sluggish on take off and winding out during shifting gear but once you get your speed up, you're ok. This may veruy well be linked to tune ups and the fact I need one, but it's always semmed a little sluggish anyway. It's only a 4 cylinder so that may ne the reason. It has nice aluminum wheels which are standard factory and an engine that has never had ANYTHING major done to it at all! I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles and that's the life of an engine in my opinion. I bought the truck with 70,000 miles and now it has 164,500 miles and still going strong. It gets about 20 MPG out on the open road which is great for a truck in my opinion. Hills and curves take away from gas mileage some however. This is the very first truck I've had that I haven't had any major problems with. I changed the oil and get tune ups every so often as well as keep a good check on everything and good tire pressure and tires rotated. I really think Ford rangers are the best small size truck made and this one has really made me a believer. I like small size trucks better than the bigger ones so that's why I'll probably always be a Ford Ranger owner. Other small size trucks are definitely cheaper, but as the saying definitely goes "You get what you pay for." I say try one out today if you want a good, reliable, well built truck that you can keep for several years before buying a newer Ranger. I'll probably try to keep mine for several more years because I'm attached to it now. It's like one of my family members, hehe.
