            I bought one last Mai 1999. I have had no major problems, other than a loose wire under the dash (loose connection), got it corrected at no cost.
It has all available features other than leather seats and not an automatic. Since mine is Canadian specs, with all the niceties that go along with a cold climate vehicle, like heated mirrrors, heated front seats, warmed windshield washer water. The draw back for some Americans may be that this vehicle is a five speed, although an automatic is available but you may have to wait longer to get yours. I bought it here in Germany at a German AUDI/VW dealership in Wiesbaden and the price was right, less than $19000.00, and I got the engine I wanted, a 1.9 Turbo Diesel that gets in excess of 48 miles to the gallon and will run up to 110 miles per hour, I drove it on the Autobahn here in Germany. About the size; it is a lot bigger than you think and can be made into a small wagon with the back seat rest down and flat. <br><br>
