            Why does your search stop here?  Well, in my opinion, this car gives you a lot of bang for the buck.  I test drove many SUV models, from the Toyota RAV4 to the Isuzu Rodeo to the Honda Passport, and found that this car is perfect for someone who is wanting a lot of features for an affordable price.  I got mine for $17,000.  It's a 1997 top of the line CRV...fully equipped with tinted windows, real-time 4 wheel drive, power windows, power locks, a/c, and a security system, just to name a few.  Not only does it have these key features, but it's a fairly smooth, comfortable, and quiet ride that actually is quite roomy on the inside (although it looks like it would be rather small from the outside view).  The tinted windows keep it nice and cool in the summer and offer a little privacy.  The real-time 4 wheel drive is an exceptional feature, especially for someone who lives in a snowy or rainy climate (I live in Colorado).  This feature keeps you from sliding all over the road and here's how it works:  anytime one of the tires starts slipping, even slightly, it kicks into 4-wheel drive mode.  The power features are great for those of us who like the newest in technology and also for those of us who are lazy and don't want to take the time to operate these things manually.  Now, for the features I didn't previously mention, but really make this car hard to resist:  two power ports, a middle drink holder that collapses down, a dry well in the back, extra storage compartments galore, and seats that flip down.  Why, you ask, are these all special?  Well, first, the two power ports really come in handy, especially in this day and age when technology is at the forefront of all we do.  I can use these to plug my laptop into and do some work for business...very convenient.  Second, the middle drink holder is great, particularly for a mom or dad,  because it flips down, giving easy access from the front of the car to the back of the car to check on the kids, dog, etc.  Third, there is a dry well in the back that has a handy portable picnic table on top (again, another great feature).  The dry well can be used to keeps drinks cold on ice, or for cold sandwiches, or simply to store things.  Which, speaking of storing things, brings me to the next great feature...all kinds of storage.  There is so much storage in this car to hide your jumper cables, maps, personal items, etc. that I have plenty of empty storage left that still needs to be filled!  Finally, the seats flip down, so someone can put her mountain bike in the back and head up to the mountains, or she can bring that brand new table home from the store, or be the lucky person that friends think of when they are moving.  So, you're asking, what do I NOT like about the car?  The only things I would change is that there is no arm rest on the passenger's side, but there are a few company's out there that offer the arm rest for about $100 (your Honda dealer would probably have a list of these companies), and the CRV doesn't come in a V-TEC engine, which probably is a good thing because I would end up with several speeding tickets.  Other than that, this is the best car I've ever owned!!  There are a lot of features I left out, so you just need to go and test drive one for yourself to find out about those.<br><br>
