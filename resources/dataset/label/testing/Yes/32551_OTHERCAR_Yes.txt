            Just before Chrismas,I went and blew lots of dosh on a DX6490 and the easyshare printer dock as discount package. I Didn't need the printer bit but what a gizmo, for producing a quick print to send the Rel's home with. My Father-Inlaw has a full on Nikon Digital and he didn't have a wrong word to say about its functions or its Results. A Good looking Camera with more than a few little things to adjust and get used to. Good results can be gained out of the box, but a little tinkering with settings brings this upto fantastic. The First thing I switched OFF was the nasty "time lag" inducing picture review after every shot.(Then I swithed ON the EVF). Much better already!. Coming from my trusty 35mm Canon EOS 650 SLR with 35-105mm zoom lens, the zoom range of the Kodak is just amazing (38-380 equiv').This giving very good results with little or no coloration or distortion visible on the final photo (even printing at bigger than A4.). Function for Function both DX6490 an Eos 650 are almost identical both in full auto and so called Manual or "PASM" mode. A nice touch is the pop up flash as on the Eos 500 (sadly not available when my 650 was born.)and the inclusion of a standard flash sinch socket under a rubber flap on the side. Several focusing modes are selectable and focus times are good on the Kodak, although hunting is much more noticable than on the Eos and the Eos has the edge on speed. The millisecond shutter lag of the Kodak takes some getting used to compared to a 35mm but does not detract from the enjoyment of its use. After all, if its a pocket snapper you are after then a 35 mm Ixus or Digital Ixus or similar is the tool for you. This Digital camera is one for the Medium to Advanced Amature, who wants 35mm type manual features in an afordable Digital Format (and a few quick Auto settings for the wife to keep her quiet on holiday!). All said and done, this will still be happily living side by side with my trusty old Eos 650 in the kit bag. 35mm is not dead just yet!.
