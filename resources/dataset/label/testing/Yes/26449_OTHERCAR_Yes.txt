               A good friend of mine got cut off while driving her Bonneville, and wound up totalling the other vehicle (a small pickup that pulled out in front of her).  She had a small raspberry on her cheek from the air bag.  It was this experience that made me decide to buy a '97 Bonneville for my wife since we were about to start a family.  Little did I know that our safe car was going to be a fun drive, too.
   Shortly after we bought the car, we drove from Georgia to Kentucky for a round trip of 1000 miles.  The ride was smoother than anything that I'd experienced.  A year later, we moved from Georgia to Colorado and took a detour through New York.  All in all, we spent a month and a half on the road with a large dog kennel in the back seat and tons of stuff in the trunk.  The seats were comfortable as can be, and our 45 lb dog's kennel actually fit without having to move seats forward.  The ride is quiet and easy to control, whether in town or doing western state speeds (85mph or so).  It also has power to spare and will accelerate without any hesitation, so merging and passing aren't any issue.
    The handling is very good, even on snow and ice, although the standard tires aren't as good as the Michelins we just put on.  The sound system is great, and I've gotten spoiled by the steering wheel mounted controls.  Even Barney sounds good through the stereo.  
    I computed our gas mileage yesterday, and it's right about 20 mpg with a mix of highway and city driving. 
    I'd buy another one.<br><br>
