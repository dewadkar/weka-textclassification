            To all who are looking for a new small truck:

    I have had a Ford Ranger since I was 21yrs old. I currently own a 2001 Ranger with the 4.0 V6.  I am now 31, so that gives me 10 years experience with both Ford and the Ranger model....


The first thing to look at with ANY Ford product, is the support for ANY and ALL warrenty issues with the dealer you purchase this vehicle from. Ford Motor Company will ALWAYS refer you to the dealer you purchased the vehicle at.

The Ranger is one of the best trucks around, and the price is very reasonable.  The 4.0L engine is very solid; In fact this engine uses the same "core" as the old Mustang 289 (For you muscle car types). That engine has been the most reliable engine made by Ford. STAY away from the 3.0L "Edge".  If you are on a budget, then buy the 2.5L engine.  You WILL suffer from a complete lack of power, but at the same time, you will not EVER need to "fix" this powertrain.

The 2001 Ranger has everything you would want, but there are some problems with this truck.

Ford has a major electrical problem with the Ranger.  You can "test" this issue by performing the following tests on your test drive:

1)  Open the DRIVER door after you remove the key from the ignition.  There should NOT be a door chime sound.

2)  After performing the above task;  You should not see the overhead lighting system on after approx a minute. (DO NOT LET THE SALESMAN tell you that is normal, because it is NOT).

3)  During your test drive;  Turn on the wipers and the washer at least 5 times.  Make sure you drive around for at least 10 minutes.  If the wipers and/or washer turns on during this time, you have an electrical nightmare ahead.

Bottom Line for this truck is that you will enjoy the most powerful truck for its' class if you buy the V6 4.0.  BE WARNED.  If you do not do the above "checklist", then you might be visiting your dealer more then you would like.

There are MANY other issues dealing with Ranger owners.  If you would like to see the Specs and issues then
