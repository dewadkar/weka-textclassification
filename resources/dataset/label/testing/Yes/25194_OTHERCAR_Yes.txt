            I bought this car because nine years earlier, I had bought a Protege and it served me well.  In fact, it was still going strong with nearly 200,000 miles, but I got in a bad accident.

So, my friend suggested to me that I look into another Protege, since the other one had served me well.  My only regret is that I should have picked a different color.  (I have a Sand Mica one, and wish I had picked teal or forest green).

After buying the car, I found out that Consumer Reports rated it No. 1 in its class.  I liked having my decision validated.

There's a lot more on this car than on my 1991.  The cruise control comes standard with the LX, it has power windows, a huge trunk and reminder bells for if you leave your keys in the car or if you leave your lights on.

Unlike the 1991, the rear seats don't lock, making it possible for valet parkers and anyone else who gets in the cab to get in your trunk.

I've never had any maintenance problems with this car.  

The moonroof is noisy, so I don't use it on freeways, and a moonroof isn't as fun as a convertible, I've found.

Still, a fun little car for a low price.
