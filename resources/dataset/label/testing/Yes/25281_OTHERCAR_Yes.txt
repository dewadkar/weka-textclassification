            The Epson Photo PC is my first digital camera, and I would highly recommend it to anyone from the beginner to the intermediate digital photographer.  Also, advanced photographers will also enjoy the ability to control a lot of the settings such as the exposure, f stops, and shutter speed.  You can even customize the white balance. If you aren't an advanced photographer, it even has settings to make it seem like one.  The settings included are : normal, sports (for high speed shots), portrait (for high detail), and landscape (for rich color).  

The camera came with little setting up- I pretty much took it out of the box...recharged the batteries...and took pictures.  Really good pictures.  It also has a nice black and white setting.  The menu is very simple.  I'm the typical guy that doesn't read all the instructions, and well- I was ok.  Now once I got the hang of it, I did go back and read the finer details.  This camera is very compact.  It's very nice to be able to go to a function and not feel like you need a &quot;Press pass&quot; to take good pictures.  

The only draw back I have it the lack of the AC adapter.  Yes there is one, but you have to buy it.  Also, a optical zoom would be nice, but the image is soo good that unless you get &quot;zoom happy&quot; on the image d-load screen- you will be able to zoom in a good deal without it looking too jagged.  There are some after-market add-ons for this camera.  You can attach a telephoto lens (adapter required) and several types of filters.   

All in all, I did my shopping...and I compared cameras till i was blue in the face- The Epson photopc 800 was my best choice.  <br><br>
