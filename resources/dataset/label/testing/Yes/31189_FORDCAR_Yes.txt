            I bought this car used w/40k miles and an extended 5yr/40k mi bumper to bumper warranty. Even with an automatic V6 I have more than enough power to merge and pass. The car accelerates and cruises nicely, although it is easy to speed without realizing it. Breaking with the 4-wheel ABS is excellent. Handling is also very good. As you may or may not know, power windows, door locks, mirrors, and driver seat come standard. I also have remote keyless entry, trunk release, and alarm (insist on this if you are considering buying, it is must have). I only wish it included remote ignition but that can be had aftermarket in an automatic. The seats are big, comfy, and recliner-like. The stereo (with standard am/fm, cd, and clock) sounds wonderful and works well. The climate control is excellent. The a/c kicks in immediately and does not appear to affect engine performance at all. The cruise control is awesome - it allows the driver to accelerate/decelerate by holding a button and releasing it when the desired speed is reached. Overall, I'm pleased with this car, but it does have flaws. It is as pretty as it is crude. As glam as it is slam. Not perfect and not apologizing. <br><br>
