            The recently restyled Honda Accord is a hybrid marvel of sporty spirit and reasonable practicality.  Before walking into the dealership to testdrive this gorgeous car, I used to think that Accords were just &quot;family sedans,&quot; incapable of giving me the sense of fun and adventure I was looking for in a new car.  Boy was I wrong!  Now that a new coupe has been introduced with an exciting rear spoiler, the '98 and '99 Honda Accord Coupe looks more like a performance sports car than a family sedan.  

But wait! Even though this car looks like it could beat the socks off a Porshe or BMW, don't be fooled into thinking the amenities you're afforded will be sold short.  Here are my favorite bullet points that make the new Honda Accord my top pick in the sub-$30K car market:

-- It has a very roomy interior capable of accomodating even very tall individuals in the rear seat comfortably.  And yes, five people really DO fit into my car!

-- A very convenient set of interior amenities are at my disposal: a dual-level storage unit in-between the driver and passenger seats, a flip-down sunglasses holder, two spacious hideable cup holders, an interior lever-operated gas tank cover, an electronically-controlled driver's seat height adjuster, and a 3-stage lever-inflatable lumbar support cushion, to name but a few.

-- The ride is absolutely heavenly!  I have a hard time driving friends' cars now that I've experienced the smooth handling, comfortable ride, and firm grip on the road that my Accord has gotten me used to.

If you're considering the purchase of this car, RUN, don't walk to your nearest Honda dealer for a test drive right away.  You WON'T regret it!!!
