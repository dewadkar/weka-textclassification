            Why is this this truck different then the others?

My favorite is that the rear doors actually open all the way, and are not like the skimpy doors that are on those other small trucks. These two new revolutionary doors lead to a very roomy back seat with a rather big interior design that is just perfect for more people. 

With the flick of a wrist the two seats in the back of the truck flip up and now you have created soo much more space for that stuff you donï¿½t want out in the back of the truck it is an ingenious idea that safes tons of room. 

The Dakota also comes with the most pulling power in it's class so that you can take everything with you when you go down to the lake for the weekend, along with the rest of your family.

The power is roughly 235 horses with the new magnum V-8 engine and has incredible strength.

So know that you know why this truck is different than the others, don't you want to buy it? My brother just got one for his family and everyone just loves the beast. The beast is a great off-road vehicle that handles very well in the mud and snow where other trucks and suv's might struggle. Also if you want to get a lift, get one because it looks sweet with one!!
