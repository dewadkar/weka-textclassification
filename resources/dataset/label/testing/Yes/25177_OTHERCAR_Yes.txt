            I like small cars.  I know that phrase may be un-American by hey, they've got spunk, are quick, and handle beautifully.  I bought this car because Consumer Report listed it as a best buy.  You know what, it was right.  

The outside is decent.  Small, but not too boxy--you can still lean up against it and impress chicks with your &quot;hot rod love machine.&quot;  If you are a lady reading this review, know I have never actually called my Protege this name out loud...only thought it....naughtily.  Mine is cherry red but I'm sure any color looks good.  I find it comforting to know that when I'm cruising on the highway, wind in my hair, not a care in the world, people can look at me and think, &quot;what a practical, economical young gentleman that driver must be for purchasing such a wonderfully compact and affordable automobile.&quot;  They sing a different tune once I cut them off going 90.  Just kidding.

The interior is surprisingly roomy for such a small car.  Leg room is ample and all the dashboard controls are conveniently placed.  The trunk is surprisingly spacy as well; you could fit at least six large sacks of sugar in it.  Who knows why you would want to, though.

Though I only purchased my Protege a few months ago, I have had no problems with it.  As far as extraordinary features, there are a few.  For one thing, the standard sound system that comes with the car is unbelievably loud and surprisingly clear.  You can make the rearview mirrors thump Jurassic Park style with the bass that comes with this baby.  Also, the handling is superb.  I love allowing my friends to give my car a test drive, watch them overshoot a turn considerably (I make sure their are no obstacles on the side of the road first), and laugh as they star at me wide-eyed and amazed.

Final word:  Worth the money and then some.  I just don't know how those folks at Mazda do it.  Maybe its the water.<br><br>
