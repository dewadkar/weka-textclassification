            Nine months after buying my 2001 Prius I am less enthusiastic about the car than I was in the beginning. Despite careful driving -- my eyes often glancing at the mpg display -- I average 'only' about 43mpg around town. Contrary to EPA estimates, I get a marginally better average on freeways.

The Prius is my retirement car. After 20 years of Sevilles and Q45s -- for a 90-mile roundtrip commute -- I figured a high-mpg vehicle would better suit my mostly in-town driving. Well, 43mpg still beats 20mpg.

Overall:

1. The car is comfortable enough, even on the 200-mile roundtrips I occasionally take. It's also roomy, though only for four adults.

2. The car is remarkably quiet. There's very little engine noise, though wind-noise at high speeds is greater than in a Q45 (about the same as in a Seville). At stops, of course, is is entirely quiet: the gasoline engine shuts down entirely, starting up again the moment you press the accelerator.

3. Options are limited. I chose a one-CD in-dash player (a six-CD player is also available) and floor mats. Cruise control is available on 2002 models and may, for $250, be installed on 2001s. A navigation system is (or shortly will be) available. I'd have chosen a leather interior if one had been available; it's not.

4. The four-speaker audio system (AM-FM, cassette, CD) is adequate. The sound is, in fact, enhanced by the unusual shape of the cabin: higher but narrower than similar-sized cars.

5. A monitor displays everything from mpg and how the motor and engine are interacting to audio controls -- and allows the driver to change settings by using his finger like a mouse.

6. The air conditioning/heating system is excellent. Using the a/c will, however, significantly reduce both power and mpg.

7. The trunk will hold four to six suitcases or a week's groceries. The fact the back seat doesn't fold down is no inconvenience unless you want to haul something really large.
