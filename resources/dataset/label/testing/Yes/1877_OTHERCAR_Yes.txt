            In 1998 My cousin final got to buy the car she always wanted, a newer style Pontiac Grand Am.  She bought a 1992 Grand Am SE with a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 3.3 litre V-6.  The car had 125000 Miles on it so everyone though it wouldn't last.  It did...

The 1992 Grand Am was the first of the new Body style.  So it had the most problems of all the body style that followed.  The Grand Ams had 2 distinced body styles and 3 different engines. there was the base model with was the SE. The SE had an base engine of a 16V SOHC Quad 4 that produced 120 Horsepower, and an option of a 3.3L v-6 with 160 Horsepower.  As well Pontiac offered the GT as the high end Grand Am. The GT offered Ground effects, Rims and more options. Under the hood you could get a 16V DOHC Quad 4 High Output with 180 horsepower and the option of the 3.3L V-6 used in the SE.  The only good engine was the 3.3L V-6, GM is not that good at building a performance 4-cylinder engine.  All Quad 4's (SOHC or DOHC) are pleaged with problems. They die faster that most engines or crack heads often, just usual unreliable and may not even go to 100000 miles. My cousins V-6 has 201k miles on it and runs like new.

The only problems with the Grand Am (besides the QUAD 4) are one big one and many little ones.  The big one is automatic transmissions have the tendency to slip and die after 130K miles, where the manual transmission just requires a clutch from time to time.  The other little things are all the small things, the Trunk lid has the tendency to rust alittle at the corners.  As well as, The front turn signals like to crack or break, power door locks like to fail, fuses like to blow and the Lighter ends up not working over time. Besides that the Only think I know that goes bad is the Driver side power window likes to slide off track.

The grand Ams have many good features on them as well.  They all seem to have good acceleration with the Quad 4 H.O. being the fastest with the V-6 close behind.  The stock stereo is Nice, with the CD deck and premium sound option along with the addition of a Sunroof and AC makes the Interior fell sporty.  The Exterior looks really good with the options of a Spoiler, 15" rims and fog lights.

the 1992 Body style went from 1992 to 1995 when in 1996 it got a minor updated body design and the Quad 4 was Replaced with a "TWIN CAM" with is still a Quad 4.  And in 1994+ models the Main engine became a 3.1L Multiport V-6 with 150 horsepower...
