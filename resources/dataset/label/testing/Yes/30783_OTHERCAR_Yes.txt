            I just wanted to write this to tell everyone that this camera is a real work horse. I have had this camera for over two years now and it still gets tons of use. Sure it isn't a USB camera, but the serial port works just fine. I have always enjoyed the quality of the pictures and all the little goodies included. I get a lot of use from the multiple picture display and the digital zoom feature. The LCD screen is bigger then most would expect at this price. It is so rare in todays times that a piece of electronics is made so well. But make sure to buy a padded camera holder for it. This camera is fantastic for someone wanting to break into digital cameras. And the price is unbeatable.<br><br>
