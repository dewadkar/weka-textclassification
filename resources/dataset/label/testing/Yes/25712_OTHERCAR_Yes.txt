                 Even though it was purchased used, I expected something more from the Pathfinder.  I assumed the reins at about 15,000 miles, frankly excited about driving my first sport utility.  After some months, when the euphoria had worn off, I began to realize the Pathfinders shortcomings.  The engine itself seems to have been ported in directly from their mini-pickup, and with the heavier chassis, the torque in first and second gears leaves something to be desired.  All the same, fully loaded, the Pathfinder is still competitive with the entry-level models of the larger SUV names.  I would drive another one given the option between it and any car, as I prefer the higher vantage point in traffic.  The four wheel option was seldom useful where I'm from, but it was nice to have it there in the several occasions in which it availed itself.  Overall, the Nissan Pathfinder is an SUV that I would rank amongst entry-level models such as the Chevy Tracker and RAV4, but I wouldn't dare pit it against the raw power of my new Ford Explorer.<br><br>
