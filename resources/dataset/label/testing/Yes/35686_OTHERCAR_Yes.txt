             When I first went car shopping in '97 I was dreading it.  I knew that I could not afford to buy a new car &amp; was desperately seeking a quality used car.  Until I bought my Tercel I thought the term quality used car was an oxymoron.

 After going to several different dealers in Orlando I wound up at one of many Toyota dealerships. I went straight for the used cars.  My find was a '95 tercel with only 15k on it. I thought to myself &quot;Who could ask for anything more&quot;.  Laugh! Well, I bought it. This car has been an excellent choice for me.  Being a single woman and really knowing little about cars I needed a good car that wouldn't break all the time like my previous vehicle's had, and sent me to the poor house because of.  Other than the most basic maintenance(ie: oil changes)  this car has cost me nothing in upkeep and is excellent on gas.  It is very small so I wouldn't recommend it to a family person, but for a single person it is wonderful.<br><br>
