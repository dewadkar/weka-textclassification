            In 1994, I bought my first new car - a black, 2-door Grand Am SE, 4-cylinder automatic.  It took a year to decide between a Honda Accord and a Grand Am. 

Some may say I made a mistake not buying an Accord (given their reputation for durability), but the Grand Am was nearly $2,000 less than the Accord.  There was a rebate available, and I managed to purchase the Grand Am for $150 over factory invoice, a feat I could not accomplish at the Honda dealership.  I planned to keep the car for several years, so resale value was not a critical issue.  I'd owned a Pontiac several years before, and I thought it was a good, dependable vehicle (though my late Grandpa was not fond of Pontiacs - he had owned a Pontiac sedan in the 1950s that he viewed as a lemon).

During the six years and 59,000 miles of experience I had with this car, I only had to go to the shop one time for anything other than routine maintenance.  And that was a problem that was my own fault.  You see, there is a handy little flip-up compartment that houses a cupholder.  The cigarette lighter is directly beside this cupholder.  I had a car phone at the time that used a charger that - you guessed it - plugged into the lighter.  

One day I was on a short trip and I recall tossing a couple of pennies into the cupholder.  Now, what does all this have to do with a car problem, you ask?  

Well, my power door locks stopped working.  My dad thought it was simply a blown fuse.  Simple.  He replaced the fuse.  Well, that fuse blowed up as well.  Door locks still didn't work properly.  The car was still under warranty at the time, so I took it to the local Pontiac dealer.  The mechanic tracked down the problem as being - of all things - a penny wedged in the cigarette lighter!

Would you believe that less than a year later, I was window-shopping at the dealership and ran into a high school classmate who was waiting to have his wife's Grand Am checked out.  The problem?  Door locks wouldn't work, he said, and the fuses kept blowing each time he tried to replace them.  I casually mentioned my door lock problem and how a penny had messed them up.  He got a strange look on his face, held up his hand as if to say "Wait!" and jumped in the driver's seat and began looking in the cigarette lighter.  Sure enough, there was a penny jammed in it!

I tell that story just in case someone else had a door lock problem with this model.  

Well, that was the only problem I had.  Everything was in fine shape when I sold it last year.  I'd bought an SUV a year or so earlier and just couldn't justify keeping both.  The Grand Am got great gas mileage and was a perfect commuter car, so it was hard to let it go.  The lady who bought it needed an affordable, dependable car for her college-bound son, so it worked out well for both of us. 

The car had been pampered, so I did manage to get NADA retail for it in a private sale.  I had all the records and it was obvious the car had been taken care of. The lady who bought it said she could have bought one for much less at  a car lot, but she could not find one like mine that had the seats covered, no stains or tears in upholstery, etc.  I have found that this can make a difference when you are selling your car private-party.  A new car salesman told me flat out that in such a case you are better off selling it yourself to get full value out of what it's worth.

Look around and you may find a good Grand Am like the one I had.
