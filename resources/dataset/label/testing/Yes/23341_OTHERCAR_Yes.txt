            I have purchased three RX-7s (new) since 1985. Bought the 3rd generation, as the new body style is called, used with 50K miles.  I was aware of some of the potential problems with the turbocharged motor, so I was prepared for spending some money to bring the used vehicle back to like-new specs. Most mechanics, even at the Mazda dealer, are not familiar with the complex system of vacuum hoses, solenoids and sensors that are required to keep the twin-turbocharged RX-7 running properly, so be prepared to do some research and searching for a good mechanic.  Having said these somewhat negative caveats, the car is my favorite of all time.  It accelerates faster than anything on the road except some of the very high end cars, like the turbo Porsches, Viper and the newest Corvette, with the performance package.  This is from a car with a little 1.3 liter engine!  The handling is as good as or better than any of those cars, due in part to the RX-7s weight of only 2800 lbs.  Braking will never let you down, short of driving in the 24 hrs of Le Mans.  All in all, it is a near-race car that can be driven on the street.  For those power-hungry gearheads, there are dozens of performance modifications that can nearly double the available horsepower and modify the suspension to make the car corner even better.  There is a substantial RX-7 club network across the country and a good information network on the internet.  If you can find a 3rd generation RX-7 in good shape and are a serious performance car enthusiast willing to spend some time and money on proper maintenance and repairs, then this is the car for you.  After all- they ain't makin any more of em!
