            This digital camera is nothing less than a marvel and a delight to use. �

The Sony MVC-FD73 is extremely easy to use, and the quality of its pictures is very high. Anyone can use this camera, so you don�t need to be a great photographer to be able to take great pictures. And the camera itself makes those pictures great with its excellent resolution. Of course, you can choose from various degrees of resolution, but they are all great.

Some digital cameras require you to hook up numerous wires to your computer. With the Mavica, all you have to do is stick in a floppy disk. Also, the picture files from the Mavica are quite small. Though it varies with the type of resolution you choose, you can hold as many as 20 pictures on a single disk!  So don�t worry about having to lug around a hundred floppy disks on your next vacation, because with THIS camera, you�ll probably only need about three. And the great thing is, the quality is always excellent. 

Of course, from Sony you would expect even more features. And you won�t be disappointed. In the camera, there is a thumbnail feature that allows you to look through minis of each picture and choose which one you would like to look at fully. And for those times that the lighting isn�t so good, don�t worry that one-in-a-lifetime shot is gone. There is a lighter/darker feature that allows you to perfect the lighting. And if you want to make the picture look strange, you can invert the colors. If you�re going for a vintage look, you can change the colors to the unique greyish color of the end of the 1800s and beginning of the 1900s, the sepia tone. And of course, you have the standard choice of color or black and white. Whatever color and effect you choose to use, you cant go wrong with the Mavica.

I can�t emphasize enough how easy the camera is to use. Just point and click and view. Then edit, put it on your computer, and open. In two minutes, you�ll end up with GREAT shots. Never again will you have to worry about over-exposure or wasted film. Never again will you have to worry about forgetting to develop or losing your film. All you need is a disk, and hey, disks are reusable. Take a laptop with you, and you have a portable developing center. Or just enjoy your pics in the camera and wait till you get home to put �em on your computer. Then you can email them to all your relatives, make calendars and greeting cards, and enlarge and reduce your photos. 

I gotta show my props to Sony and their AWESOME camera. For only 450 to 500 bucks, there is no better digital camera investment. So go and buy it today!
