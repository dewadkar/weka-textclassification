            In the city of entertainment, Las Vegas, Nevada, there are many things to do and see that could excite people, both tourists and locals alike. Their are billion dollar hotel/casinos, all hours nightclubs, strip clubs with gorgeous girls, and weather most people only dream of. The sun shines everyday in Sin City, as we like to call it. Being different is the only thing that matters in Vegas, and buying a 1999 Plymouth Prowler does just that. The car is beautiful, bottom line. I bought it with about 22,000 miles on it, but the car is clean inside and out. The guy that owned it before me probably treated it better than his wife. What's wrong with that? Purple is the color to get when buying the Prowler. It's like buying a red Corvette-it's just the color to get. If you have a nice car in Vegas, you often go "crusing the strip", which is driving up and down Las Vegas Boulevard where all the casinos are. Believe me when I tell you, my ride blows all other cars off the road. People would much rather gaze (and gaze is what they do) at my Prowler than any Mercedes, BMW, or Porsche. Yeah, those cars are nice, but too many people have them, and their not different enough. The Prowler is a very comfortable vehicle. I'm 6'3 and I have enough leg room to manuver, so the rumors about the interior being to small are not true. The car jumps off the line, and speeds up real fast. It handles beautifully, and you can even move into stick mode while you are driving. It takes turns real well, and changes lanes beautifully. The car just owns the road, both visually, and performance wise. This is my only vehicle, however I do not drive it that often. I bum rides off friends and relatives, just so I can save and savor my vehicle. Believe me, bumming rides all week to work is worth it because when the weekend hits, and it's 85 and sunny out, my day has arrived. Before I owned this vehicle, I owned a 1994 Mustang LX and a 1999 Mustang GT. I wish I would never have gotten those, and just saved for a brand new Prowler. I guess we live and learn. I advise all those who love cars more than life itself, love to clean and detail cars, and even once in a while drive one, and bask in all the glory that you have the sweetest ride on the block to get a Prowler. Next time you're in Vegas, look around for a purple Prowler, Nevada license plate NRVUS. Check it out. Everyone else does.
