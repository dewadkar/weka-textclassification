            One of my friends has this SUV.  She got it when they had their third child.  She wanted a bigger vehicle so they chose the Cherokee.  It is red with tan interior.  It is four doors and much easier to get the kids in and out of.  It has four wheel drive.  That is good in the snow and I am from the south, so it is good for mudding too!! 
 
She loves this SUV.  Her other car is a 2000 Dodge Neon and she would rather drive the 95 Jeep.  This SUV handles really well.  It holds the road on curves.  It has a tape player, automatic door locks and windows.  It is four wheel drive.  It is nice looking.

It doesn't get very good gas milage.  But then again what SUV does?  The back seat folds down for in case you want to haul something. It handles corners and curves really well for a SUV. 

Thank you for reading and have a good night!
