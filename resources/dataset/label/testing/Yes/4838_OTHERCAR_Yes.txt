<TEXT>
            we purchased our 1999 LHS used in december of 1999. it only had 14,000 miles on it, and it was in mint condition. it was formerly used as a corporate company car, which meant this car belonged to one of the big wigs at Chrysler! this was good news, since we knew it was completely maintained by Chrysler. 

DRIVING

The LHS drives amazingly nimble for such a huge car. we find it very easy to park and manuver. The turning radius is a good size, not too large, surprisingly small for such a boat. the independant suspension makes the car feel like it's gliding on a cushion of air. when you hit rough pavement there is some road noise, however the impacts are never jarring. 40mph turns can be taken with little protest and a small ammount of bodyroll. The 300M handles slightly better because it's tuned for more agressive driving, while the LHS is for comfort and performance. Being a 1999 model, the cars were a little noisy, so we had MOPAR Mastershield Undercoating and Rustproofing applied, which acted like a sound barier, and made the car quieter. I hear the roadnoise was corrected in 2000. The car is huge inside and out. The trunk will swallow whatever you give it. The all leather interior is extremely roomy for 5 adults front and back. The front seats are heated and come with 8 way power movement plus 4 way manual headrest movement and manual lumbar support for the driver. 

PERFORMANCE

The '99 LHS is equipped with Chrysler's 3.5 Liter V6 SOHC engine that puts out 253 HP and 250lbs of torque. The interesting thing is, only the 1999 series has an output of 253HP. all the other years, Horsepower was reduced to 250. The engine has an active intake manifold that tunes the engine for optimal performance. the intake manifold consists of two sets of runners, one short, and one long. during normal driving, the manifold tuning valves keep the long runners open for excellent torque output. however, when the driver wants maximum performance, the tuning valves will engage and open up the small runners for maximum horsepower and speed output. The 3.5 liter engine is mated to chrysler's more durable transmission, the 42LE. It is similar to the transverse 41TE trans. however, it is rotated 90 degrees. so the LHS is front wheel drive, yet is still able to have a North/South mounted drivetrain. Talk about engineering! The transmission seems to have all the previous bugs worked out, since it has performed flawlessly for us to the tune of 4 years. 

QUALITY

This car seems to have excellent build quality. We've had very little maintenance done to it. We had to have a recall done on it and that is it. However, there is one complaint i must make. The GoodYear Eagle LS tires on the car, though giving excellent traction, seem to be of low quality. the car has 33,000 miles, and the tires are shot. The tread is worn, and multiple belts have snapped. We are still waiting to replace the tires. Once that is done, the car will run smooth again. There is also one small squeak in the car when it is driven over bumps. the squeak can also be heard during loud bass play with the awesome stereo. However, those two problems are minimal compared to the overall satisfaction we have with it. Interior fit and finish seems to be very good. there are no loose panels, no giant screws showing their faces. i'm proud to say that only the 1999 model LHS has the molded wings on each side of the dash clock, which looks very classy IMO. All controls are easy to use and execute smoothly. Cruise controls are large buttons on the steeringwheel. They lack backlighting, however are easy to memorize with just a few uses. The exterior is almost as beautiful as the day we've bought it. there are some imperfections. The imperfections come from many trips to the groccery store as well as someone cracking the rear left light housing. There are some dings and scratches as well. None are Chrysler's fault, but the fault of careless passerbys who hit our car. This car has NO visible rust whatsoever.

FEATURES (and their workings)

- AUTO DIMMING REARVIEW MIRROR: works flawlessly and reduces glare without hindering visibility.

- CRUISE CONTROL: steering wheel mounted. lacks backlighting, however is interactive. if car senses overspeed, will downshift automatically to allow engine braking.

- QUAD PROJECTOR LAMPS: includes fog lights. 1 set of lights on for low, both sets on for high beam. the coverage is excellent and inspires confidence at night.

- 120WATT INFINITY SOUND SYSTEM: 9 speakers. 4 front, 1 dash, 4 rear. front speakers work in tandem with the imaging dash speaker to give both driver and passenger 100% stereo sound. rear speakers give mono sound to rear passengers, however, enhance the imaging for the front. (typical of almost all cars today)

- ANTILOCK BRAKES WITH TRACTION CONTROL: ABS works great in rain and snow. increases handling and steering during panic stops. traction control works great in rain and gravel. in snow, works great as long as one wheel has traction. if both wheels have no grip, then Trac. Control will just ensure that the wheels spin at equal revolutions. (typical of all 2WD systems) 

- AUTOMATIC TEMPERATURE CONTROL: works very nice. will not blow heat until engine is warmed up, so no cold air blows around. AC is very powerful. works with exterior temp sensor, interior temp sensor and dash sun sensor to find optimal settings for the programmed temp. Can be manually overridden. 
[many say the stereo and ATC are hard to understand and use...maybe to the inept, but i find them simple to use.]

- REAR WINDOW INTEGRATED ANTENNA: gives excellent reception. however, when rear defroster is on, there is interference. 

- SENTRY KEY SECURITY SYSTEM: keyfob arms security system. key has encoded chip. will only start with correct key. 

- FRONT HEATED SEATS: work great, and fast. LO and HI setting. will heat you fast, even through your thick winter coat.

- AUTOMATIC HEATED MIRRORS: engage whenever either front or rear defrost is activated. 

- OVERHEAD CONSOLE: displays temp, compass, distance till empty, ignition on time, trip odometer, instant fuel economy, average economy. built in HOMELINK transmitter. can be programmed to 3 radio devices. either home lights, garage doors or gates, etc. 

- DUAL VANITY MIRRORS WITH LIGHTS

- OPTIONAL SUNROOF: the kind that opens into the roof

- ACTIVE INTAKE: automatically tunes engine for power and torque or speed and horsepower.

- PLATINUM SPARKPLUGS: with individual coils, no plug wires or distributors. good for 100,000 miles. 

- RECOMMEND MIDGRADE FUEL FOR MAX PERFORMANCE. REGULAR FUEL IS OK AND SAFE, MILAGE WILL SUFFER SLIGHTLY. 

- REPLACE TIMING BELT AT EXACTLY 100,000 MILES TO BE SAFE. 
AVERAGES 90 TO 110,000 MILES. 
IF TIMING BELT BREAKS, NO ENGINE DAMAGE WILL OCCUR. 
NON-INTERFERENCE ENGINE. 

- SECOND GENERATION DRIVER AND PASSENGER AIRBAGS

- VERY LARGE 6" WIDE TORSION BAR UNDER DASH TO IMPROVE STRUCTURAL RIGIDITY

- THEATER SEATING: rear seats positioned 2" higher than front. so rear passengers dont feel like they're sitting in a tub.

- REAR TRUNK PASS THROUGH: a large 8x10" opening exposes the trunk. allowing lumber or skies to fit in the trunk and protrude into passenger compartment. 

- FULLY ADAPTIVE 4 SPEED ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION: computer controlled, will adapt and learn the driver's style to give smooth shifts, or added performance feel. will adapt to wear and tear, so no trans. adjustment is ever necessary. just fluid changes. features a "life monitor" or Clutch Volume Index. dealer can read the indexes and determin how much clutch material is left, and how long the trans. has to live. Also features "limp home" mode. if trans. malfunctions, will automatically shift into 2nd gear so you're not stranded. 2nd gear allows driving home or to a dealership for service.
