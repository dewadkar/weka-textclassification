            I purchased my 4-door 1994 Pontiac Grand AM SE about 2 weeks before I turned 16 in Aug. of 1996. The vehicle had only 35,000 miles. I have since drove that car all over the place. I live in Tennessee and have taken trips to Detroit, MI (4 times), Toronto, ON, Sandusky, OH (5 times), Panama City Beach, FL (3 times), Louisville, KY (4 times), Atlanta, GA, Cherokee, NC (about 10 times), and to Houston, TX. I have also taken this vehicle 45 minutes north of where I live to Nashville uncountable times. I put approx. 13-14 gallons of gas in the car and go about 400 miles before I fill up again. I have had very few problems with this vehicle. I've changed batteries a few times and alternator twice (I have a lifetime warranty on the new alternator, so it cost nothing to replace, plus I had 400-1200 watt amps. and 2 12" subwoofers in trunk for years). I have changed the transmission fluid and filter 5 times and the transmission runs great. I change the oil approx. every 5,000-7,000 miles and often use the 5 minute system flush and used to used Mobil One pure synthetic oil when I did it myself, now the oil change place I go to uses Pennzoil pure synthetic oil. I have the original shocks on the rear, and they are fine. I've replaced the front struts one time. The vehicle had a cheap, plastic vacuum line in it and kept causing my A/C / Heating controls to stop working along with the cruise. The Wal-Mart battery was leaking acid and caused breakage on the line. I replaced it easily myself with a rubber line that's held up since. I replaced 1 motor mount, not too expensive. I replaced the ignition coil f times. Goodyear (Gemini) has replaced it 3 times and I did it once myself. My theory is that when I used to spray my engine off with the hose, water gets into the hole on the side of the motor cover (above where the spark plugs and ignition coil & module are located) and causes the ignition coil to short out. It hasn't happened since I stopped spraying the engine off. I had to replace the heater core once. One of the non-replaceable plastic hoses that come off of it broke. I replaced it with one that has metal hoses. It was a very difficult task to change it, but I managed and pretty sure that I saved quite a bit of labor dollars. I have not had any engine or transmission trouble. Other that this, any other repairs were caused by something I did, like bending the tensioner which the alternator belt hooks around. Replacing the alternator was a little more difficult that other vehicles I've worked with, but not too bad. I had to have the crankcase sensor replaced at 205,000 miles. Over all, at over 220,000 miles, with most of these problems happening after 100,000 miles, this vehicle has been wonderful. Shows that taking care of a vehicle makes it last! CHANGE YOUR TRANSMISSION FLUID AND FILTER EVERY 50,000 MILES (I've done it more frequently)! Update (11/2003): The power steering pump is going. Hard to steer at take off, but fine once you get going. I've been told this is common for GM vehicles.
