            My partner (we'll call him James) and I have been together for nearly 5 years despite the fact that we have very little in common.  Case in point, he's a total car-buff.  In our 5 happy years, nearly 30 cars have passed through our driveway.  He's kept one or two as long as a year, but generally, the shelf-life of a car in our household is about 6 weeks.  His co-workers are planning an intervention to somehow get him into a 12-step program.

On the other hand, when we met in the fall of 1998, I was a 25-year old without a license.  No, I didn't lose my license.  I simply never had one.  It wasn't a priority.  I walked a lot, and I had the calves to prove it. (It must be said though that while James has an irrational penchant for automobiles, the same case can be made against me and my CD/vinyl collection.)

I really don't know much about cars, but 97% of what I do know, I've learned from James.

His most recent purchase is a blaze-orange (the official color name is "tangerine" - but it's approximately the color of a hunter's cap) 96 Mustang Convertible.

What generally happens when he brings home a new car is that he spouts off a bunch of information about it (that means very little to me) with the enthusiasm of a child describing his Hot Wheels to his less-than-interested babysitter.  I nod, I smile and laugh when it seems appropriate.  I proffer the occasional "Wow" or "That's neat" or "Good for you."  

Usually, he adds "I think this one's a keeper", but I've heard that before.  The use of the word "keeper" in our household isn't the indication of permanence it is elsewhere.  Don't get me wrong.  He does keep every car he buys.  

At least for a couple of weeks.  

He'll get a new stereo for it, buy new tires for it, wash it daily... and then, find something he suddenly likes better to replace it.

On this occasion however, I think he means it.  But then, it's only been a week, so he could yet make a fool of me once again.

Whether or not we keep the car for any substantial amount of time, one thing's for sure.  He loves it.

And actually, though I hate to admit it, I kinda do too.  It's a nifty little car, and it's color is quite an eye-catcher.

For instance, driving down East Washington Avenue in Madison, Wisconsin yesterday, he nearly ran a red light.  We did stop, but we were well into the intersection, even after we'd backed up to get out of the paths of drivers turning in front of us.

Behind us, a guy shouted out, "That's a great color!  Very cool car!"

I turned and shouted back, "Thanks!  Now, if we could just learn to drive the darn thing."

Fellow drivers usually aren't this nice when someone has committed an act of traffic stupidity as obvious as we had.  And yet, here was this guy behind us smiling and waving and laughing and talking to us like we were good people who really did know how to drive. He might have invited us over for a barbecue had the light not changed.

We received enthusiastic compliments on no fewer than three separate occasions in the space of a single afternoon, from fellow motorists we had never seen nor spoken to before.

The Tangerine '96 Ford Mustang is a powerful force of peace and goodwill between men.

It is also quite rare.  The Mustang was only offered in tangerine for one year - only 800 or so were manufactured, and around 250 of those were convertibles.  These statistics made James happy, and well, I thought it was kinda neat too.  

Aside from its ability to inspire goodwill from perfect strangers on the streets, it's a nice car to drive or ride in.

Mind you, I'm no connoisseur.  I've only been driving for 4 years, and I drive a 2000 Chevy Prizm.  No sports cars for me, no sir.  I take my motor transportation practically.  

But if suddenly there was a law dictating that we must all drive sports cars, I could do worse than to get a '96 Mustang.

It gets around 20 miles to the gallon.  While, for me, as a Nader-lovin' tree-hugger, that's not quite acceptable, it's certainly no Hummer either.

The seats are extremely comfortable, although for men of Goodman-esque build like James and me, there could be more leg room (and forget about sticking anyone in the back seat).

The dash has a slick, elegantly sporty design, although it (and actually the front hood of the car) sit very high which gives driver and passenger a little-kid-sitting-at-the-grown-up-table kind of feel.  It's not necessarily unpleasant, but it takes some getting used to.  

When the top is up, the sightlines both through the windshield and on the sides of the car feel restricted and narrow.

For a car as old as this (though ours has only about 30,000 miles), the steering is quite tight and the car handles very well.  While driving, I never had a sense that any part of the car was beyond my control.  It felt like an extension of my body.

With its V8 engine, you can get some really nice speed pretty quickly.  And (this is the part James likes best), you get a nice butch grumble from the engine when it accelerates.

Yeah, baby.

The only serious bummer about this car (and it's a bummer about convertibles in general) is mostly a geographical one.  We live in Wisconsin.  Convertibles and Wisconsin just don't mix well.  It's not just that for 9 months out of the year, the weather is too inclement to put the top down.   Even with the top up, convertibles just aren't that fun to drive in the winter.  They're cold and they lose heat quicker - they're also more prone to leaks.  Not fun at all.

But then, knowing James, we won't have this car by the time winter rolls around.
