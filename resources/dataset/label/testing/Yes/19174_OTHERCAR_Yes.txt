            While surfing the Internet a couple of years ago, I found many positive references to a new 1998 car in Europe.  It was the newly re-designed Passat and it had many, many positive comments.  A few months later, it was introduced into the United States, received great press: Car and Driver and Consumer Reports -- two quite different publications -- both indicated the Passat as a fine car choice.
It is roomy -- not quite as wide as my old Bonneville -- and peppy. The peppy comes from the optional 6 cylinder version vs the 4, which I have only test driven.  Great tires -- Michelin MXV4's -- a fun automatic with a manual shift option, precise handling and very large trunk are other features I like.
A negative: too small side view mirrors, especially the right one.
I have been driving the car about 18 months now.  I love it.  <br><br>
