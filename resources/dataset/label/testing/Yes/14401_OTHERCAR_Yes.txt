            As if Lamborghini's Diablo did not have enough power, the Italian car company decided that a Super Diablo was needed on the market.  So, they supercharged the #1 Sports Car of the Century, according to many sources. This car truly gives meaning to Italian car design and shows the difference between Italy's automobile production and that of the United States or any other country.  All you have to do is compare this car with anything from the Ford Mustang to the Dodge Viper, from the BMW Z8 to the Mercedes SL600.  Though these are all nice cars that I own, I enjoy the pleasure of laying back and riding the cool waves of the Diablo.  The seats are so comfortable, you will think that the cows were just killed to obtain the leather.  As you shift and sense the car moving into 6th gear, you know you are in heaven.  The engine is so beautiful, you could sit back and stare at if for hours at a time and weep for joy that God has allowed such a beautiful specimen to exist.  Thank you Lamborghini.<br><br>
