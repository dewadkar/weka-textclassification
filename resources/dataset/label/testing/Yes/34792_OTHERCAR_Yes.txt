            mitsubishi has done it yet again! The montero sport just keeps getting better and better. sporting a new body style, a stronger engine, better traction and a heck of a lot of fun into their already well built SUV package. Its wider wheel base and firmer suspension make handling in this sport utility much easier then before. With a luxurious interior (to match the newly designed and very attractive exterior) a fine sound system not only will you want to test drive this vehicle on and off road but you'll want to wrap it up and drive it home immediately. Test drive one today and see for yourself why the montero is fastly becoming a favorite of off and off road sport utility fans!<br><br>
