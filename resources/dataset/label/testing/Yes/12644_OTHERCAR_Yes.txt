            And you can get compact flash cards in sizes from 2MB cards all the way up to the IBM microdrive, at 340MB. It's like loading 45 rolls of 35mm film all at once. The PowerShot S10 brings your communications into the digital universe with its cross-platform USB connection. The software that came with the camera was Zoombrowser, Photorecord, Photostitch, and Adobe Photodeluxe. Adobe Photodeluxe caused me to do a full restore, so we won't discuss that one (arrgh). 

Zoombrowser is the utility that you can first download your images to - it is easy to use and fast. We connect with a USB cable and 70 pictures transfer in less than 5 minutes. You can look at them all and do minor adjustments in your pictures here. Photostitch allows you to stitch the photos together easily, you just choose them and the software does the rest. I haven't used Photorecord yet, but it lets you make digital photo albums.

By connecting your S10 to your computer (PC or Macintosh) via the included USB cable you can download your photographs at 20 times the rate of the older serial connections. With today's high-capacity storage devices, a quicker download is essential, and with the USB connection, you can now communicate at digital speed. The camera allows you to view all the pictures you have already taken on the LCD monitor, and easily delete ones you don't like.
