            I purchased a used 1991 Mazda 323 about a year and a half ago. It had 125,000 miles on it and seemed to be in good running order. I bought it from a woman who received it as a gift from her father after graduating high school and has been driving it since then. 

Since purchasing the car its daily life has changed dramatically. It was used to simple trips from home to campus everyday for four years (a 10 mile trip), and then used as a second car for the next 7 years. My lifestyle was far more demanding. 

The car in only 16 months now has 200,000 miles on the odometer and that landmark is why I'm writing this review. 

Here's what I love about the car: 
Still gets 33 miles to the gallon. 
Doesn't burn any oil. 
No fluid leaks at all. 
A recent check by a Mazda Mechanic revealed no loss of compression. The engine still has a long life ahead of it. 

Maintenance items have included: 
All parts are genuine Mazda (unless otherwise noted) 
Timing Belt at 155,000 
Oil change every 3,000 
New brakes at 125,000 and 180,000 (I'm quite hard on the car) 
New CV Axle�s just recently. 

The axel issue is one I do feel should be addressed. 
The Continuously Variable axels were replaced with cheap NAPA axels (a considerable price difference over genuine Mazda) However the Mazda axels when replaced had nearly 180,000 miles on them. The Napa ones have lasted only 20,000 miles. So when I just replaced them, spent the extra cash for the Genuine Parts. 

Now the reason I keep this car is not only because of its reliability but also because of its durability. The car has taken me from Minnesota to Alabama to the Florida Keys and back twice. I wouldn't hesitate to take it anywhere. 

When buying a car that�s this old you can't expect that the car will hold up as well as I've said. This is due to the fact that many older economy cars simply haven't had the care of a genuine Mazda mechanic. If the car you're looking to purchase has had multiple owners, do yourself a favor and look for a service history. 

Knowing what's been worked on is good, but knowing what parts where used is just as, if not more important. Threes a reason aftermarket parts are cheaper. 

Good luck and I wish you the best
