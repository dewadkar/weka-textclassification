            You want prestige?  Luxury?  Want to turn heads?  Don't buy a Saturn.

You want good value?  Terrific customer service?  A reliable gas-sipping car?  You gotta look at a Saturn!

We haven't had a small car in years.  We have four kids and three dogs, and it just hasn't made sense to get a minimobile.  But when my husband needed a car just for his 20-miles commute, we quickly decided that small was the way to go.  After talking to Saturn owners and reading about the car on various e-boards, we decided that this was the car for us.  

So we wandered into a dealership one night.  You know how the sales staff usually pressures you in some way?  No pressure.  They're enthusiastic about their products, but they don't try any of those cheesy selling techniques that you see at other dealerships.  They don't have to.  They sell at a fixed price, and they know there will always be people ready to buy their product.

We test drove the SL and SL1, both in manual shift.  The SL was just a little too hard to drive -- no power steering.  Otherwise, it's a really good value, in my opinion.  The SL1 was just exactly what we wanted.  It drives zippily and quietly, and it has just enough interior features to make us happy without paying lots of extra moolah.  Unfortunately, we had decided that we had to have a black interior, and we had to have a car within a few days, so we had to upgrade to the SL2.  Not much more money, and a very nice car.

On our visits to the dealership, we were also impressed with the unique Saturn body design -- parts tend to snap off easily so that they are easily repaired or replaced.  We have had reason to test this.  I drove the wrong way over a curb I didn't see and knocked my bumper off.  My daughter tied it back on the car with dental floss, and the whole thing cost less than $100 to fix.

We have 8000 miles on the Saturn now, and it's been great.  We'll drive it forever.  <br><br>
