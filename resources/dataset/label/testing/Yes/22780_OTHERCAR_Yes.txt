            This is probably the best car I have ever driven. The ride is so smooth it is amazing. The seats are comfortable and the dashboard is great.  

First of all this car is top of the line.  It is the flagship of Oldsmobile, and there is reason it is the flagship.  The cars interior has so many amenities.  It has a great stereo system, the dual temperature cotrol is great and it even has an onboard trip computer.  The seats also are 12 way motorized. They even have settings to remember how you like your seat so if someone else drives it and adjusts it when you drive it again you don't have to fidget with the chair.

The next thing I have to talk about is this cars unparalled driving experience.  The ride is incredibly smooth and responds beaitifully. Also if you only like driving heavy cars than this is definetly the car for you.  It is just purely a great car to drive.  You will enjoy the ride wether you are the person who is driving it or just in the passenger seat.

Now if you have a family then you will appreciate this.  The back seats have plenty of leg room even for extremely tall people.  They will enjoy the ride and won't be squished up in the back seat like you are in so many cars. 

The only problem with the car is that the dashboard is reflected on the windshield.  What I mean by this is that you can see the top of the dashboard in the windshield. Now this can be a problem while you are driving if you are distracted by this. However if you really love this car other than that (I am sure you will) then you can get something to put up there to stop the reflection.

Last of all I would like to talk to you about the the exterior of this car. This car just yells to me watch out. If you are looking for elegance with a sense of sportiness this car is that and more.  The rear of the car has a very interesting curve which makes this car. The front of this car is also very interesting. IT is long with  interesting curves and ripples in it.  It is a very unique car which will leave a lasting impression in you head. Also if you are looking for a specific color than may I suggest the red. It is just simply the best color.
