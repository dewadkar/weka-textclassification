             I recieved the olympus d-450 zoom as a Christmas gift. Upon opening the box I was a little skeptical I figured I would have to be Einstien to operate this device. But to my surprise this camera is very easy to use. 
 I found that the pictures come out very clear (regular photo quality). The camera has a LCD monitor letting you see the picture before and after you take it. 

FEATURES

1.3 megapixel sensor CCD

1280 X 960 resolution

3x optical zoom

2x digital telephoto at any focal length

stores pics on a 8MB uncompressed card

sequence shooting 2 frames per second

3x image inspection

red eye reduction

force flash... fill in flash

There are really to many features to mention. 

 The camera is light weight, and easy to use. You really just point and click. And to put the pictures on your computer you just plug the camera into your camera port and it starts downloading.
But to use some of the features on this camera is a different story. The instruction manual is very hard to read and disorganized. The manual comes with every language imaginable but the sections aren't separated so you have to sift through and find your language. Read the directions and then sift through again.
 The only complaint I have about this camera is that it goes through batteries like WATER. Especially when you have the LCD monitor on. But that is sorta the whole purpose to see what u are taking a picture of.

 I would recommend this camera to the beginner or advanced digital photographer. Good luck and have FUN
