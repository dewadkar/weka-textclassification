            We purchased this vehicle in May of 1999. I operate a daycare in my home and regularly transport four to six children on a daily basis. We took our first long road trip in July to Galveston, TX. The van with the TV and VCR made the trip very enjoyable! We have two teenagers and they were able to listen to their own music through the headphones which helped everyone keep their sanity! The reclining seats made for extra comfort when a short nap was needed.  
Low gas mileage is a factor, however, the extra comfort and convenience make up for that disadvantage. It does get almost seven miles a gallon more on the highway than in the city.
I wouldn't recommend a full size van as a vehicle to drive back and forth to work everyday as it would not be very economical but for traveling it can't be beat!<br><br>
