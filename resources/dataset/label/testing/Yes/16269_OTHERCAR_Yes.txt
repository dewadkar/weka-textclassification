            The Toyota Corolla is more of a love and hate vehicle.  You'll hate to love it.  My parents bought this vehicle for me for commuting to college.  The Corolla was not my first choice for a car to say the least.  At first, I found that it is really a perfect commuter car.  It does not guzzle gas like my old car, but it lacks the punch to make driving exciting.  First, the car is well built with relatively few creaks and rattles on the road.  It is roomy for the driver and front passenger, if the seats are pushed all the way back, leaving the rear passengers with less leg room.  The controls for all the accessories are well placed and easy to reach.  The trunk has ample room to hold books and groceries.  
Driving the vehicle is like a well behave school boy.  The car does what you want and is well manner on the freeway.  However, like a well behave school boy it lacks the power to stand up to the big boys.  When the car is fully loaded with passengers and cargo, it feels as if it's struggling.   The lack of horse power is evident on when going up steep inclines or when your carrying too much weight.  I think the car is perfect for a small family, and those that just commute, like myself.  The lack of interior space for the rear passengers eliminates it from being a full family sedan.  Overall, this car is a good car that I learn to love.    <br><br>
