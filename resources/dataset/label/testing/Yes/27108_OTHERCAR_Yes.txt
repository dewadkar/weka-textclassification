            Have you ever seen the Cutlass Supreme Convertible on the road? If you have, you probably gave it a second look, because it doesn't look like any other convertible. Drop-top and room for 5 without sacrificing leather interior, climate control, air bags and anti-lock disc brakes? You bet!

I wanted a convertible car that could do anything. I have a family and can't stand the new 2-seater roadsters for the lack of space. I wanted sports-car look and feel, too, though I knew Miata-like handling is only attainable in a Miata sized package. Lastly, I needed something unique. Something that had the combination of sport, luxury and pure look-at-me individuality that I love.

The Cutlass Supreme Convertible has all that.

The &quot;Sport&quot; is covered by the fact that it's a convertible and has the 3.4 liter DOHC engine. That's 210 horsepower, stock. It's got nice punch throughout the powerband.

The &quot;Luxury&quot; is covered by the 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, automatic climate control, fog lights, leather seats and other interior appointments. These are great seats, really. Even the back-seat is comfortable for adults. Lastly, for a convertible, it's a VERY quiet ride with the top up. I was amazed at that fact and it continues to impress me.

The &quot;Individuality&quot; is covered by the fact that it's relatively uncommon. How many Honda's do you not give a second glance to every day on the way to work. The distinctive &quot;roll bar&quot; and dual-exhaust keep it looking sharp, and most often, these babies have the striking color schemes to match. Mine is red with white top and white leather seats and black carpet for a nice 2-tone interior.

Driving is very comfortable in this car. Steering-wheel mounted climate control and radio controls are very handy. With the top up (which has a real headliner and glass rear window), it's a nice, roomy coupe with some get-up-and-go when you ask for it. With the top down, it's a comfortable, airy ride that is my personal paramount of relaxation after a rough day at the office.

Maintenance can be demanding. Don't ever let the timing belt break - replace it first, and keep the transmission well serviced.

If you're a car lover or convertible lover, this car is for you. If you want basic to-and-from-work transportation, maybe you should look elsewhere, as the maintenance of a convertible and the 3.4 liter drive-train does require some maintenance more than others.<br><br>
