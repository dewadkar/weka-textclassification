            The 1995 Nissan pick up is one of the best choices you could make for that year pick up, it has good  power, nice looks, and not a bad ride for a 4x4. I plowed with mine and it did a great job, and I live in Maine and we can have alot of snow up here some winters.The jump seats in the back are so so, ok if your a child, 5 yrs of age to 10 or 11 yrs of age, but for teenagers and up it is not comfortable, if you have more then two and one child in that age range in you family I wouldn't recommend it.
The handling is also very nice for a small 4x4 pick up, even when I put agressive tires on it, there wasn't to many places i could'nt go with mine with a good set of tires. The seats
were very comfortable for me and I am 5' 5&quot; with a back problem, if i have to hold my foot in the air to use the clutch it will kill my back and this is the first manual transmission that didn't bother me at all to drive,I could keep both heels on the floor and shift, no one with any height that drove mine seemed to have any problems with driving it,untill you got over the 6' range. hauling capacity is average for a small pick up, anyone wanting to haul large loads should buy a large truck. it has a 3500 lb. towing capacity, which isn't to bad. and one more thing about the jump seats, child car seats don't fit at all, they hang over the front of the seat and you cant secure them. Over all its a great truck. mine would run great on anything i put in it regular or unleaded gas,(no diesel...:)..... and a  nissan engine will last well over 2 to 3 hundred miles if maintained properly.<br><br>
