            I must say that I was a bit apprehensive when my mother bought this car. Not for the safety reasons because everyone knows that Volvo's are the safest cars on the market. I was worried b/c of how old she truly got in trading her cute little sports car in for a Volvo... 

I truly couldn't get over it. My mom drives a Volvo. So I pretty much decided that I wouldn't go near it, if I had to drive somewhere, I would use my clunker (a true lemon) rather than a Volvo. Because truly, look at how bad they use to look and how uncomfortable they were. 

But you know what? When I saw the car she bought, a black S-70 turbo, I realized that &quot;okay the new design isn't THAT bad&quot; and that its also &quot;pretty cute.&quot; And well, the day that my clunker finally bit the dust I had to drive the Volvo around and it isn't bad...

...actually it handles great. I can't lie. It hugs the turns. The seats are comfy, roomy interior, its great. It handles like a little sports car, it looks like a little sports car, so pretty much it is one. I never thought that I would admit that, but I feel the need to tell the truth.

I drive the Volvo more than my mother does, its great. I love this car- its wonderful. I feel competely comfortable when driving it (both safety-wise and also in actual comfort). Its great and we haven't had any problems with it. Not to mention that they all come with a great security system and also great warrenty deals. 

Anyone who cares about safety (whether their own or their loved ones) should get this car. Volvo's safety is impeccable and the new model S-70 comes with all of that and attractiveness. So its great! Everyone should go out and buy this car, I truly recommend it.<br><br>
