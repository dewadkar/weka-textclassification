            I am new to the digital camera market, and had quite a bit of learning to do, before purchasing a camera. I am happy to say that the recent purchase of the Olympus D450zoom was a good one. 

While researching cameras, I discovered that there are some features that I definitely wanted, and some that were not worth the extra money to me. For example, I had to begin with pixels. I am still not sure what pixels are, but I know that I wanted around 1 to 1.5 mega-pixels, for sharp and clear pictures.  I also wanted a zoom capability that would actually zoom, not just digitally enlarge the picture. I wanted to be able to control how many pictures were stored on my camera. Most importantly, I wanted to be able to up- and download pictures easily and quickly. After all, why use digital if you can�t email, right?

 Well, the 1.3 mega-pixel Olympus had all those important features and more. There are two different zoom settings; one is the digitally enlarging one which can come in handy, and the other is an actual zooming lens, for close-ups. 

The Olympus also allows you to set the quality of the pictures, from good to better and best. This is important, because the better the quality, the fewer pictures you can store at one time. For example, when the quality is set at �good�, the camera is able to store around 122 pictures at one time. When the setting is moved to best, you can only store 36 pics. 

The pictures are easy to upload, and the camera offers two options for the process. You can load the pictures by plugging in the accompanying cord, but the process takes a long time and draws from the camera battery, not the computer power (why is that???), or you can pay $79 more for a floppy disc adapter. With this adapter, you take the tiny &quot;brain&quot; �out of the camera, fit it into the floppy and then pop it into your computer. The pictures are available for viewing and email in a matter of a few minutes. The thumbnail pictures, which are available in the computer, and on the camera screen, make choosing just the right picture a breeze. 

So, if you are in the market for the wave of the future, check out the Olympus D450Z digital camera!
