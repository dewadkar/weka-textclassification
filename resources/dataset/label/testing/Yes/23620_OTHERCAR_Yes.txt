            I used to tell my friends, &quot;My truck is outside.&quot;  They would walk outside and say, &quot;That's a Jeep.  It's not a truck.&quot;  They were right--and wrong.

My 1996 Jeep Cherokee had enough cubic meters in its interior to move all of my possessions. Twice.  Well, the luggage rack on top held the mattresses with no problem.  The 4.0 L, six-cylinder engine didn't feel the extra weight of my furniture as I could still pass on the highway with ease.  These tasks are usually only talked about by truck owners.

The ride is very quiet--comparable to most cars.  Certainly not like any pickup.  The engine is powerful, with plenty of leeway for pulling trailers, boats and whatever else you want to move.  The interior is plain and basic--this part the designers of the Cherokee took from pickups.  The exterior is durable.  I was even rear-ended by a Saturn and suffered only a dented bumper.  The Saturn was totaled, with the hood of the Saturn pushed almost back to its windshield.

The faults of the Cherokee lie in its interior.  Leg room is not the best for tall drivers.  The seats don't go back as far as most cars.  the gas pedal and brake pedal are close to each other, and I often found myself trying to stop while pushing the edge of the accelerator pedal with my braking foot.  I would also choose a dark interior if you plan on moving furniture, etc.  Maddening stains showed up quickly with my beige interior.  I also recommend the four door if you have passengers that will use the back seat.  If you're not a midget, you're going to have a tough time getting out of the back seat of the two door.

I'm still not sure whether it's proper to call it a truck or not.  I have gotten used to calling it a Jeep because it is a truly unique automobile.<br><br>
