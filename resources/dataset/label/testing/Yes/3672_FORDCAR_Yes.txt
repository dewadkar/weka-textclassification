                I bought my 1999 Ford Crown Victoria from a local ford dealer. This is a big and powerful car. It has a lot of body force and power. I bought this vehicle of its size and power. This is one of the biggest sedans in the world today. American cars are more powerful than foreign cars. 

    My 1999 Ford Crown Victoria comes with alarm, key code, cruise control, keyless remote control, dual air bags, leather seats, a.m./f.m. stereo cd player, automatic transmission with a column shift, and the parking brake is a foot brake. My car is a full size 6 passenger vehicle. The things I like about this car is it's big, it has lot of room inside, a huge trunk, a strong car, and it can hold a lot of weight in back of the trunk. Some of the things I hate about this car is it's hard to park, it makes some funny noises sometimes, boring interior: not that much special functions, and it's hard to wash the car when it gets dirty. When I drive my Crown Victoria it's like driving a huge truck because of it's enormous size. The Ford Crown Victoria shares the same platform of size and strength with its father the Lincoln Town Car, and its baby brother the Mercury Grand Marquis. The Ford Crown Victoria is a police car, and is also used for cab drivers too.

   My Ford Crown Victoria is 212 inches long. I would think the biggest sedan is Ford Crown Victoria, and the second biggest is Mercury Grand Marquis, and the third is a Lincoln Town Car. The only reason why the Lincoln Town car and the Mercury Grand Marquis is as big as the Ford Crown Victoria is because the ford motor company makes them. The Lincoln Town car is a  luxury car. It would cost around $40,000. The son Ford Crown Victoria would cost around $20,000. Also the baby brother Mercury Grand Marquis would cost around $19,000.  If you can afford a  luxury car then go for the top model Lincoln Town car. Other wise just go for the low price Ford Crown Victoria or the Mercury Grand Marquis.
