             Hello everyone. I too, just purchased a new Dodge truck. I got my first Dodge back in May of this year. A white Dakota Club cab. I love it. It's perfect for me. Roomy yet not a huge vehicle. In this truck, I got a six CD changer, tunnel cover, bed liner, and wheel flares. Very nice to say the least. It's such a nice ride. Very quiet for a V6 engine. To say the least I am very pleased about my new truck. That's why I had to go buy another one.

 Only this one was a 2001 Dakota Quad Cab. Let me tell you they are very sharp looking trucks. Ours is silver with grey interior. Very roomy, so therefore makes it easier to haul stuff. It has a very smooth ride. The only thing that it is missing, is some nerf tubes to help vertically challenged people, like myself, to get into the truck.

 This truck is ideal for a family with a small child that is still in a car seat. It has child lock doors as well as child lock windows. The truck also has little &quot;secret&quot; compartments, for example, you can lift both back seats up to store things under them.  

 It's is true that the beds are shorter. They are only 4 foot instead of the 6-8 foot beds that most trucks have. But hey, the rest of the truck makes up for it. 

 So if you are looking for a sharp ride, but still need a family vehicle. This is perfect. And for the people that live in places like I do (cold places that are likely to get snow) this truck comes in 4WD. So there you go, it has everything you need in a vehicle. Roomy interior, sharp looking, child safety features, and a 4WD. And of course for you out there that are interested in all the engine stuff, it has the new 4.7 liter engine V8 Magnum in it. Very nice, smooth ride.<br><br>
