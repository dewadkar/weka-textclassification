            I bought my 1999 Malibu LS new in February of 1999.  I fell in love with it on the test drive and liked all of the available features that are usually options on other cars.

Love:

Like I mentioned above, this car has so many standard features that are usually extras on other cars.  It is V6, it has a CD and cassette, has the intermittent wipers, air, everything.  

The seats are very comfortable and make any long trip more comfortable.  However, I chose the cloth seats which are on the LS model, and they are a little hard to scoot in the car when wearing a dress.

There is so much room in this car.  I like the theater style seats, meaning that the back is a little higher than the front so that passengers in the back can see easily.  Everyone has plenty of leg room when you have four adults in the car.

The car handles very well and is easy to drive.  

Hate:

Within the first year of ownership I have had a few problems.  One problem is that I have had to have both tail light assemblies replaced.  The good news is that it was under warranty (thank goodness!).  The left side went out, I had it replaced and then within 2 months, I had to go in and have the right side replaced.

I have 24,000 miles on my car and have already had to have the brakes replaced.  This seems like low mileage for having to get new brakes.  I was told by my dealership that I did better than most people because some have had to have them replaced as early as 16,000 miles.  One very big problem with the Malibu brakes is that they are very costly!  I spent over $150.00 having the front brakes replaced.  I was informed when I asked if my husband couldn't replace them that if he didn't have a special tool that he could ruin the rotors and they can't be turned.  They have to be replaced when they go bad.  Thank goodness I went in when I first heard the squeaker so that I didn't ruin the rotors.  BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU HEAR YOUR SQUEAKER.  Get it in as soon as possible!

Also, I had to replace the windshield wiper blades.  They are two different sizes.  The driver side blade is 22 inches (narrow) and the passenger side is 19 inches (narrow).  This can be a big pain when buying new blades.  There may be a safety reason as to why they did this, but I'm not sure what it would be.

I was also told that if you aren't careful when you purchase new tires that the people who put them on could mess up your brakes if they don't have the right tork.  That is thought to keep in mind when thinking about buying new tires!

Overall:

Overall, I am happy with my Malibu and enjoy driving it.  However, I think before I buy another vehicle down the road, I will check into the parts and prices before I consider it.<br><br>
