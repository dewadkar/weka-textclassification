            Well, I just finished writing my opinion on my 1992 Ford Probe LX.  I couldn't resist writng another one on the 1994 Probe GT.  I don't actually own this vehicle, my girlfriend does.  However, I get to drive it often enough and have been around it constantly. 

We bought this car for $4500 with 94k miles.  It has only been 2k miles later though.  I can't talk about reliability I guess except from what the guy before knew for the most part.  He said that in the time he had it then only major thing he had done was have the brake pads/rotors replaced.  He spent a lot of time driving from here (Rochester, NY) to Washington, D.C.  

He loved the car as much as we do.  Almost didn't sell it infact.  The car is an absolute blast to drive.  It has a smaller V6 (2.5L) than my 92 LX (3.0L) and as a result has a little less pick up off the line.  However, it nets more horsepower (165 as opposed to my 92's 145) and has a greater power band.  Basically, I can take my girlfriend off the line, but she has the mid range power.  

The car itself looks sharp.  It is pleasant to look at and is much better looking than the 92 models.  Personally however, I like my old style better than this one because it looks like less of a &quot;girl&quot; car.  However, this car pimped out with fog lights, cd-player, spoiler, power seats, and power windows, is an undeniably fun vehicle.

This being essentially my second Probe, I love the cars.  They have proved to be nothing less the economical, fun, and reliable to me.<br><br>
