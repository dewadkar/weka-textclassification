            If you like to drive fast and love gadgets, you will like this car. The car has a lot of power, quite roomy, good looking exterior, and fills with cool gadgets. It certainly is not a S2000 or a Porche 996 when it comes to handling. The body rolls a bit too much when you corner in this car. It has a lot of power, and can feel the torque when you hit the gas. The ride is plush (compare to other sports coupes) and quiet, but you can still hear the V-8 grunt when you floor it. I've gone up to 140mph, and it was quite effortless and smooth. I didn't even notice I was going 140.

The steering wheel has four buttons to control cool gadgets in this car. My favorite is the voice activated cell phone. You can ask it to dial a number or store a name and tell the phone to dial that name by saying the name. It actually records your voice, and repeats it when you say the name. It works quite well. One thing that I didn't like was that the phone I got was not compatible with new AT&amp;T plan, so I got an AirTouch phone and the coverage isn't as wide as AT&amp;T, so I lose connection once in awhile. It also has a rear window shade that goes up and down by pushing a button.

Overall, I like the car, but if you are looking for a sharp handling car, this car isn't for you. However, if you care more about luxury, gadgets, and comfy, go check it out. <br><br>
