            I was looking for a good value in a new car that included automatic, ac and a cassette player, and I hit it on the nose with the Cavalier. A great city car, fits into most parking spots, a tight turning radius and good gas mileage. Additionally, we've used it for fairly long road trips (5 hours) and it's held up fine - if you're going to be spending alot of time on the highway I would recommend cruise control. Last winter when everyone was floundering about in the blizzard I drove my wife to work and was really impressed with the way the car handled in the snow. For just over $14K this car has totally surpassed my expectations and I plan to drive it for as long as I can. The only thing I would do differently is get a four door instead of a 2 door - it's a little impractical.<br><br>
