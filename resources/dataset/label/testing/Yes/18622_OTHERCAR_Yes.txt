            I recently purchased a 1999 Olds Alero and wasn't expecting much but your average midsize family sedan. Boy was I surprised! The handling is exceptional, the seats are so comfortable and the power is amazing. When you step on the accelerator, it responds! The console has everything set up so that you can adjust the heat or the radio without leaning up or taking your eyes off the road. The trunk is huge and the leg room for backseat passengers is very comfortable. It also has a neat feature of turning the headlights on and off for you, so no more forgetting and worrying about a dead battery. I am trying to think of something that I don't like about this car, but I can't! I would recommend this car to families and single people alike because it is somewhat luxury and sporty all in one. I give it an A+.<br><br>
