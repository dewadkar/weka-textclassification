            I have bought two Lexus SC 300 Coupes, the 1995 and the 1999.  Racy and reliable are the two words that best describe my experience with the Lexus SC 300.  My 1995 Lexus SC 300 was my dream car.  I couldn't have asked for a better car.  Mechanical problems were nonexistent.  The only drawback was my tires wore out too fast, but that could be partially due to the fun I was having driving my SC 300.  After four years, I got new car fever and bought a 1999 Lexus SC 300 Coupe.  Again, I couldn't be having more fun.  When I drop my child at her school, the kids who are members of the safety patrol race to open my door.  You can hear them saying &quot;my car.&quot;  The kids even tell me &quot;nice car.&quot; The best description of the service department at my Lexus dealership is don't worry, be happy.  I love the service, which includes loaner cars.  Therefore, I always get to drive the newest Lexus ES 300.  (I owned a 1990 ES 250.)  I can't really hate anything about this car, except, maybe the necessity for buying more and more tires.  This is my third Lexus and I buy them because they are reliable and fun to drive.  If you have lots of kids or haul around lots of kids, this car probably will not meet your needs.  However, if you spend most of your time driving solo or as part of a couple, this car will serve you well. <br><br>
