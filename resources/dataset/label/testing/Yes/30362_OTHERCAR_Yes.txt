            This 2001 Pontiac Aztek has been all the buzz lately.  The marketing campaign blitz that accompanied its arrival on the market made one of my friends' wife salivate.  Till this day, I don't know what attracted her to this vehicle.  Well as long as she keeps it, she will have a great set of wheels.  With all the placements in the Survivor Show which attracted lots of viewers last season, many people have become accustomed with this vehicle.  All the while, I was very reluctant to think it's a vehicle that I could buy my wife.  I never pictured myself driving it on the rare days my wife would let me do so.  <b>But, I had a huge change of heart and attitude toward the Aztek after I went up the hill with my best friend in his wife's SRV</b> 

<b>Gone Fishing In The Foothills of Yosemite at Millerton Lake area</b>

My friend and his wife have already taken their new vehicle to a fishing expedition on the Central Coast.  I think they went to the Pismo Beach area.  They had no problem loading up their surf boards and pulling their boats.  In fact, they showed me pictures of their tent by the beach and their catch.  They did not plan to stay at a nearby motel and hotel.  They had enough space in their car for the two of them.  <i>The seats can be folded down, removed or flipped forward to make enough space for them. </i> The addition of their tent makes it more spacious.  In our trip to the lake in the foothills, we did not have to think about spending the night.  Early that Saturday morning a few weeks ago, we headed up the hills.  With his cooler full of beverages, fishing rods and bait in tow and our boat in the back, we were ready to have a grand' ole time up there.  We made sure to check our fishing licence.  I knew I would be the sole sober one.  Already, my friend and his gorgeous wife started drinking as soon as we got there.  

On the way up, I observed that the Sport Recreation Vehicle pulled and grabbed on the road very well with its large track Michelin tires.  The tires are 15-inch all-season ones.  Sitting on my bucket seat at the steering wheel, I realized that I had enough leg space. The 2001 Aztek is rugged.  "It was built for this type of environment" added Betty, my friend's wife.  She saw that I was slowly falling in love with her truck or SUV.  I glanced at her in the back and noticed that she had lots of space too.  She is an average height woman.  I truly like the way the SRV handles the road.  It's interior is truly comfortable.  I then grabbed my cup of orange soda from the cup holder.  Looking at the dashboard, I realized all the technology that is in this SRV must not have been just by hazard.  In fact, GM designers have been working on this car to be a hit among the <b>active, young crowd, the surfer's type or those adrenaline-driven people out there</b>.

<b>Delivery of Constant Source of Power</b>

If you decide to take a Pontiac Aztek for a test-drive, you will find out that it is powered by 3.4-liter OHV V6 engine that packs as much as 185 horsepower.  It is said to have a great appetite for <b>towing assignments</b>.  This truly explained why, for a long time on the journey, I did not account for the boat the SRV was pulling.  This one is all-wheel drive.  I just wished that we had taken this trip to the snow in the Sierra Summit in the dead of Winter to see how this truck would fare.  Based on my experience with it, I can say that I doubt I would have any problems up there. 

<b>A Sure Head-turner In Its Own Right</b>

Some aesthetics and design critics are quick to say that it's because it's so ugly.  Now that I have driven this vehicle, I know otherwise.  It's more than the exterior look.  This is a gutsy SRV.  It can carry all sizes of people and cargo.  All you need to do is to take advantage for its flat load floor.  If you are going to hike and have lots of gear to transport, the 2001 Aztek is the vehicle for you.  With just the two of you, you will have even more space than you can think.  You won't have to squeeze your luggage any more in a tiny spot.

Just keep in mind that as the driver, you will be very comfortable in your bucket seat.  And to make space for your luggage, you can fold, flip forward or remove the rear split bench seats.  They are lightweight and modular designs.  Don't worry about their weight!
