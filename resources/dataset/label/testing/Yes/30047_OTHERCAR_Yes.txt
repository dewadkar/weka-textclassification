                    Wading through the jungle of choices for digital cameras can be scary at best.  Kodak, however, �tames the wild animal�, with its DC240 digital camera.
 	Straight out of the box, they begin with batteries � knowing that you�ll be anxious to use the camera, they give you a set of batteries to use immediately.  But, knowing that cameras use up batteries quickly, they supply you with rechargeable batteries and the charger.  The owner�s manual is handy, but this camera is so easy to navigate that my wife, who is not the least technically savvy, could figure out the basics of using it with little help.  The buttons are conveniently located and logically laid out, and the menu almost helps itself. Kodak even provides a decent size memory card (20 megs), alleviating the frustration that 8 meg cards can give.  The USB connection is great for quick downloads, and the video out provides quick access to photos via TV.  Even the lens cap falls off by itself when the camera is turned on.
	The quality of pictures is excellent, even at 8x10.  My only problem now is getting a printer worthy of the camera.
	Finding negatives with this camera is a bit difficult, however there are a few features lacking.  The LCD viewfinder is located right where your nose goes if you chose to use the optical viewfinder, leaving smudges on the screen.  If you�re careful, this can be avoided.  
Also, a voice memo for tracking particulars would be nice.  
And, for all that the camera comes with, you miss a simple case to put it in for protection, and an AC adapter to use while the batteries are charging.  These are easily obtained otherwise.
Given a choice to trade this for another camera � Simply put, I wouldn�t.
