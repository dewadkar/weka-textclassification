            Surfing the web a few weeks back I entered a contest to win a Cannon Powershot Digital Elph.  Amazingly, I won.  I never win anything.  So winning the camera was a plus from the get go.  I highly suggest winning your Elph; it cuts down on the $499 price tag.

I've owned the camera for two weeks now, and have seen its many pros and few cons.  

To begin the camera is very lightweight and very small.  Its a little wider, but the length and width are smaller than that of a box of cigarettes, making it very easy to carry.  It fits in ANY pocket.  The camera casing is 100% metal, no cheesy plastic.  This casing makes for a very durable long lasting camera.

I am very impressed with the options the camera has, all of which are very easily manipulated by the way. The camera has all the standard digital camera options, as well as additional options.  There is a simple auto/off flash button, up close (4 to 22 inches) option, infinity option (greater than 22 inches away), as well as picture size options.  The available options are designed to allow the operator a large amount of control over the pictures, but not so much that taking a simple picture becomes tedious.  

Even if you manage to screw up taking the picture, the software included with the camera, Cannon Zoom Browser and Photostich, as well as Adobe Photo Deluxe Home Edition 3.1, allow you to easily correct any mistakes.  I have taken pictures with low light and too much light, and then went into Cannon Zoom Browser to touch them up.  The results look professional.  The software is simple to use, anyone technologically literate enough to use the camera would have no problem using the photo editors.

Although this camera has many great features, there is some room for improvement.  The battery that comes with the camera has a slightly short life.  The package includes a charger, which is a plus, however the battery only lasts long enough to take about 12 large pictures, and view them.  Of course, you could make the battery last longer by not using the LCD display, and taking smaller pictures.  All in all, the battery supplied is not enough to last through say, a baseball game or a day trip.  I would suggest purchasing an additional battery.

Another con to the Elph is the 16MB storage disk supplied.  This disk holds minimal images, only 12 large images.  I would also suggest purchasing at least another 16MB disk.

Over all, the pros of this camera far out weigh the cons.  The camera is lightweight, extremely small, rugged, and very high quality.  With a little extra investment in another battery and more storage this camera is idea for any application.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone seeking professional quality images with an amateur�s budget and experience.  All of the goods packed into such a small package is proof size doesn�t really matter.
