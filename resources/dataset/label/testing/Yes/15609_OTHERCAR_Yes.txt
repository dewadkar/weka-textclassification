            Sony really went all out with this camera.  It is one of the few cameras on the market that works with a floppy disk.  So you can take your disk out of your camera, and pop it right in your computer.  It's just too cool! 

 You can use the view finder or the built in screen on the back of the camera to see what you are shooting.  It has a manual or automatic setting for your convenience.  It comes with the best zoom feature that I have ever had on a camera.
  You can zoom in close on someone a block away and they never have a clue that they are getting their picture taken.  So you  get a lot of great candid shots.  Another neat feature on this camera is the mini movie feature.

  Even though this is a still shot camera, you can flip it on movie and take a 60 second movie complete with sound.  A minute doesn't sound like very long, but you will be surprised how much you can get in a minutes time.  

I have been having so much fun with this camera, and the price has already come down $150 since we bought it.  If you are considering a digital camera, I suggest you take a look at this one.  In my opinion, this is the top of the line.<br><br>
