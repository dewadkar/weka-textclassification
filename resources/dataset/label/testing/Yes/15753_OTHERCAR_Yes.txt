            This camera is a very much like a professional digital camera in its performance.  The pictures are very clean, and sharp. The lens for its size performs extremely close to the larger format lenses. In the automatic or program mode, it very much like the larger SLR cameras for ease of use.  As like many of the small cameras there is no flash shoe or external flash connection.  If an optical remote flash sensor is used, a remote electronic flash can be used with the camera (not documented).  It will take some expertise to work this out. The picture quality is very much like 100 ASA film up to sizes of 11 X 14, and maybe a bit larger.  There is very little background noise or grain in the pictures from this camera. In the program or manual modes there are very many setups that can be used.  This camera will work as a fully manual camera, with EV exposure compensation if required.  The scrolling function button can be a bit tricky to get used to.  When using the manual focus, a magnified image is displayed. This can be a bit tricky to get used to, but works well.  The macro function is very good for general use. The software with this camera can be a bit tricky to install if the installation instructions are not followed exactly.  But, the software is very simple to use.  Both the software and camera operation are very well designed.   After investigating many cameras in this level and a bit higher,  I would say it is the best one that I could find. As for taking pictures this camera is very simple and accurate.  As for the manual setup modes, it can get about as complicated, as you want, with very flexible setups. When this camera is taken right out of the box and the battery is charged up, you can start taking great pictures immediately without any complications, or setups to do. It is highly recommended to get a bigger memory cartridge than the one that it comes with. A faster memory cartridge is also an advantage. A spare battery is also ideal to have.
