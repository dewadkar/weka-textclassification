            We bought a 97 Millenia in 12/98 with 12,000 miles on the odometer.  We both admired the car since it was introduced but the sticker price at the time was way out of our range.  Mazda initially priced these cars in the $32-$38K range if memory serves me correct.  Later they dropped the price and I looked at a 2000 model fully loaded for about $31,500 a few months ago.  We were happy to find our car at a local high quality used car dealer for about $20K, so we traded our 96 Protege (another fine car) and have been very pleased with the Millenia.  I could have bought a new Camry or Accord for roughly the same price, but these cars seemed bland in comparison--not to mention everyone and his brother has one. 

 The Millenia has been around essentially unchanged since its debut in 1995, and to me still looks fresh in comparison to current offerings in this league.  Ours is not the S version with the Miller cycle engine but has adequate power (not great but not a sloth either).  We have about 43,000 miles on the car and have had no problems whatsoever--just routine maintenance. 

 When we traded our compact Protege, we intended to buy a larger car but having recently added a new baby to the family we have discovered that the Millenia is not as big as we thought. A trip to the beach proved that we will need a bigger vehicle before any new youngsters are added.  My father in law liked the vehicle and considered buying one, but at 6'3&quot; his knees touched the dash in the drivers seat. Probably not the best choice for tall people or those often carrying a lot of gear. This car is a good alternative for those wanting a little more luxury than an Accord or Camry or for those not seeking the snob appeal or the price of a Lexus or Infiniti. Mazda in general deserves a closer look and produces a quality product.<br><br>
