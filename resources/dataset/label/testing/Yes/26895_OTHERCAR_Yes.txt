            I bought the 1998 Dodge Caravan SE and I have never been more satisfied with a vehicle in general.  I have had it into service for some MINOR things like radio vibration, ect...nothing major and I was always given the best customer care.  I am actually leasing it and pretty sure I will be purchasing it at the end of my lease I am that satisfied with it. The things I like about it is both side doors open, the integrated child safety seats on the middle bench which I Highly RECOMMEND anyone with a toddler or preschooler get..they are perfect for the child who has outgrown his toddler seat.  This van Drives very smoothly and is extremely comfortable to travel in.<br><br>
