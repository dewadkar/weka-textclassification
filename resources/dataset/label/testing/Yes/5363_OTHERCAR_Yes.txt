            This is one dependable car. After all I put it through I'm suprised that it lasted the year that I had it. I ran it into an elevated railroad track at 30 miles an hour, I never changed the rotors even though they had indentions, and I never changed the oil once. The car kept going and going. It was an automatic and had no features except air conditioning and a radio. I got excellent gas mileage and never even put it in the shop. I thought this car would last forever until a friend of mine totaled it. Then I went out and got another Nissan but I got a 240sx this time.<br><br>
