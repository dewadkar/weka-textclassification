            So I step off the Hertz shuttle and approach the parking slot assigned to me.  Hmmm... I wonder what I got this time for the week.  A Mustang! Good, I had always wanted to try a mustang.

Well, right off the start, I was disappointed.  The car is quick, but just not fast.  This is due mainly to its hefty weight.  Mustangs weigh over 3,000 lbs., and it feels like it.  The 193 hp V-6 just isn't enough to overcome the bulk.  Flooring the mustang as I went up highway on-ramps, it felt like the car was dragging.  (Plus, my interior smelled like pee, but I won't hold that against the car.)

Nevertheless, as the week wore on, I found the mustang to be a pretty fun ride.  Maybe it didn't stick me to the seat, but it was fast enough to zip around.  Plus it is rear-wheel drive, so you can try to kick the tail out a little when you turn.  This can be fun, or very bad if you live in an area with lots of wet, slippery roads.  One day, I hope to test drive a v6 manual and then a v8.

Exterior styling is subjective, of course.  Close-up, those non-functional side vents look quite cheap.  But overall, I think the current generation of mustangs looks pretty good.  Most people seem to agree, seeing as Ford sells over 100,000 of them each year.  You might want to consider this if exclusivity is a factor.  No matter where you go, there are always mustangs around.  

By the way, is it just me, or is there no friggin' keyhole on the passenger side??  I never did figure out how to unlock the car from the passenger side.

Fit and finish are quite good for an American car.  I didn't notice any obvious flaws or rattles.  Overall, the interior looked pretty good too.  It didn't feel or look too cheap.  The cruise control was different to me.  There was no 'cancel' button, which struck me as odd.  I believe the buttons were cruise, resume, and set. I've never seen this before, even in other Ford cars.  

My only major complaint about the control layouts was the center console's depressed position.  Every time I wanted to toggle the radio or AC, I had to lean forward and reach.  I don't know why they made the console this way, especially considering that more people are likely to use a lower or further back driving position in a car like this.

Gas mileage was lousy, but not as bad as I expected.  Like many large engines, the mileage is quite good once you're on the highway.

So in short, I would say the v6 auto mustang(about $16,900) is the definitive "chick car."  It's flashy, but is far from the fastest thing on the road.  If I were to get a mustang, I'd just go all out for the 260 hp GT($20,800).  Afterall, the mustang is supposed to be a muscle car.

If you absolutely must have the skin of a mustang and you don't care about speed, then I suppose the v6 is the most practical choice for you.

Other contenders:  I've never driven <b>camaros</b>($17,300 - $21,870), but from what I've read, they are overall faster than mustangs (v6 vs v6, and v8 vs v8).  However, I feel that camaros are of much cheaper build quality than mustangs.

The Toyota <b>Celica</b> GT ($16,985) is similarly priced to the v6 mustang.  The celica handles better, but it's looks may be more polarizing.  Go with the celica if reliability is more important to you.  If you have more money and care for speed, binge for the celica GT-S ($21,400).

Also consider: Subaru <b>Impreza WRX</B> ($23,490), Mercury <b>Cougar V6</b>($17,200), Mitusbishi <b>Eclipse GT</b> ($20,900), Honda <b>Prelude</b> ($23,600) and the upcoming Acura <b>RSX</b> (?).
