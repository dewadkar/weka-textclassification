            I bought this vehicle used on December 07, 1999. The features that attracted me to this car initially were the excellent fuel economy, and its low price. Over time I fell in love with this car. I noticed right on that the 1.9L 4 cylinder was not exactly the most powerful of engines, but the 5 speed helps give it some added zip (and I had a big old 350 V-8 prior). Shifting is easy, and almost effortless, and I have had no problems with the transmission itself (aside from fluid change/maintenance).       
      The instruments and controls are easy to use, and are arranged with the idea of "form with function". Seats are comfy in the front, cramped in the back...not a good family car, but if you're single with no kids, it is perfect. The safety features are also note-worthy: dual front airbags, height adjustable seat belts, and steel safety cage w/ crumple zones. As a side note on safety, last December I hit a patch of black ice while driving on the freeway, while the car did a 720 degree spin, it did not flip, and fortunately I did not hit anything, only thing damaged was my confidence in winter driving in Chicago-land.
     The car isn't the quietest on the road, but then again it is an economy car, not a high end luxury roadster...you get what you pay for, but it isn't too bad if you keep the radio up, and just enjoy the trip itself. Over time I have noticed the dash squeak and creek a little bit, but I believe it may have more to do with the car needing a bit of work (which I shall go into shortly).
     Now, onto the negative side (the part you have all been waiting for!) The engine itself is not the best in my opinion, for one it lacks the extra zip that a driver may need on Chicago freeways, and it seems to have some little....quirks. The one I have had was this: I have been meticulous with the oil changes, every 3000 miles, yet the engine consumes quite a bit of oil, due to sludge buildup on the rings, and valve stem seals wearing out. I am guessing the person who owned it prior to me wasn't as mindful of such trivial things as proper service intervals. Also, the oil pan and valve cover gaskets seem to be wearing out, but that is due to age/mileage I believe. Overall, a good rebuild will solve the problems (which shall be done as soon as the weather warms up, and I acquire the extra funds/time).
