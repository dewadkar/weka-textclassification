            The Dodge van that I have is the 1989 B350 (1-ton) model. It has a 360 V-8 with TBI (throttle body fuel injection). I bought it for $700 and it needed a lot of work! Apparently, it had been poorly maintained by prior owners. Once I got the bugs worked out, it has provided good service to me.

I had to replace the steering gearbox, it was leaking fluid. From what I have read on the world wide web, this is a common problem with this era of Dodge vans and trucks. Also replaced the muffler, heater blower switch, and usual tune-up items. A/C was not cooling. Oil pressure was low, which was helped by changing the oil three times every 100 miles after buying it to remove sludge and by using a higher weight oil. The smog pump needed to be replaced.

The engine is, for the most part, easy to work on, because most of it is inside of the van under the doghouse. The power steering fluid reservoir can be difficult to fill, though.

It rides very well for a van, not too bumpy at all. There is a lot of room inside for cargo with the seats removed.
Even with a new steering gearbox, it tends to slightly pull from side to side, requiring small corrections with the steering wheel while driving straight down the road. It recently developed brake noise due to worn out rear shoes (currently being repaired),but with good brake shoes braking ability is good. The van tends to stumble as you accelerate from a stop, but is smooth after that. Have not found the cause of that problem yet.

The radio is very sensitive...can pick up far-off FM and AM stations other radios cannot.

It is a gas guzzler though...mileage is about 10 m.p.g. The gas tank is huge (necessarily). I think it can hold 30 gallons.
