            Ever been around a member of the opposite sex that exuded such magnetism you found them nearly irresistible? Fujipix 4900 abides the same quality. Its a beautiful camera to look at but it also delivers fantastic quality. To say "beautiful" is to be subjective perhaps but I mean its sleek and compact.
 The operator can switch between viewfinder viewing and the larger ECF by a simple push of the button. In fact the Fuji 4900 is loaded with buttons. Even the Zoom lens can be manually manipulated by a simple button slide. It features built in flash like many of the competitors in the 4900's class. It goes the extra mile though offering a hotshoe ready for your attachment on top for more vigorous challenges. It ships with 16MB media card where many competitors are using 8MB. 
Pictures  can be instantly viewed and discarded if you like by a quick gaze into ECF. It features an excellent bracketing manipulation and an onscreen overwrite lets you know when you have correctly set it as it does for nearly all settings. This feature virtually ensures absolute success in your final image or simply hit a button and do it again. This feature most likely cannot be over emphasized as older enthusiasts, used to the 35MM, will find the "no wait to see 'how they turned out' ritual" a most refreshing benefit. Better experts than I still argue as to which rendition is more brilliant but for my eye the minute difference between a digital image with the 4900 and a traditional 35MM exposure, are impossible to discern. The Fuji 4900 4.3 is easy to set up and a pleasure to operate. Your friends will marvel at the camera's beauty then be downright jealous when you show them some instant pictures.
