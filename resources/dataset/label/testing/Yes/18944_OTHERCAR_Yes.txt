            I am a regular subscriber to five current automotive publications--Motor Trend, Car and Driver, Automobile Magazine, Road & Track, and AutoWeek--so naturally, my cousin asked me to go along with him to shop for cars. He was in the market for anything up to $60,000, so we had a large amount of makes to cover. Since I am an Audi aficionado, I took him (in my S4), to the local Audi/Mercedes/Porsche dealership first. He absolutely loved the cars, but was not in any rush to have a car just like mine. A Mercedes or Porsche didn't fit his tastes, so we pushed on to other dealerships--many of them. Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen, Acura, Lexus, Saab, Jaguar, and Cadillac dealerships: just about nothing. He came very close to purchasing a great Saab 9-5 Aero, but was repulsed by his salesman's arrogant demeanor. We again moved on: this time to Honda, Infiniti, Toyota, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac. He again found nothing. As I was about to scream from frustration, we spotted a Mitsubishi dealership, and decided to give it a whirl (mostly because there was a great 1995 Mazda RX-7 that caught my eye--I later bought it, and found it just right for the racetrack). 

After admiring a glossy black Galant LS with tasty looking leather seats, we stumbled into the business offices and demanded a test drive. It was well past 10pm by then, but a friendly saleswoman gladly pulled the keys off a hook and fired it up. The engine had a pleasant, well put together sound. The performance was astounding, considering the Galant is a front drive family sedan. It didn't measure up to my Audi in most respects (because it is in a much lower price/status class of vehicles, and has front wheel drive), but considering it's positioning in the marketplace, you begin to realize what a truly great car this is. It's ride was dead quiet, the handling was great for a front driver, the interior was nicely finished (the faux wood looks excessively cheap, though), and it was a sexy looker. Best of all, though, was that this car could measure up with cars costing much more than this. Some high priced cars that this car could easily beat: Volvo S40/S60, Toyota Avalon and Infiniti G20. My cousin was immediately sold, and with his picky nature, that says something great about the Galant!

Mitsubishi's ads for their Galant and Eclipse had always turned me on, but I never really wanted to go into thier showrooms. Thier cars (especially the Galant) possess a very tasteful, chiseled design, but I never thought they could even come close to satisfying my Audi craving tastebuds. Boy, was I wrong. Audi rules, but Mitsubishi is definitely very cool. 

Before you assume that a higher price means a better car, drive the Galant!
