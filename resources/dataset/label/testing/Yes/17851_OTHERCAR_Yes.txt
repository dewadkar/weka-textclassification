            Of course it would not be wise to travel the winter roads in a sports car. Therefore, when I returned to the Magestic Green Mountains of Vermont from school, flashing my sporty red Eagle Talon, I had to make a change of vehicle. One that could portray the sporty attitude, yet plow through the buckets of snow that mother nature offers. Where did I find such a vehicle? I found the Chevy Blazer 2000 2-door sport...in Victorious Red. How fitting!

As the image of the vehicle suggests, the Chevy Blazer drives like a sports car (a little higher off of the ground of course), but when Jack Frost decides to present a challenge...the Blazer shows its power and reliability. While semi-trucks and cars attempt to make the wintery treks, with the only success being that of leaving a trail like a snake in the road, the Blazer continues to show its wonderful handle in the snow by showing no faulter. The proof? Well, the other night on the mountain (Killington ski area), there was a snow fall of about 16 inches. While all other vehicles could not make the road, my blazer had no problems whatsoever. 

Now, what is a brand new car, that can drive anywhere, if it had nothing to enjoy the ride with? Well, you are in luck with the new Chevy Blazer. Its features include an amazing factory stereo system (both cd and tape players) that can boom sounds of dance music or just play some classics or jazz, an outside temperature gauge (to tell you when the roads might be getting slick), many storage departments, and many many more!

Thus, the Chevy Blazer 2000 has been shown to be a wonderful vehicle. It is sporty, reliable, luxurious, and fit for any walk of life!
