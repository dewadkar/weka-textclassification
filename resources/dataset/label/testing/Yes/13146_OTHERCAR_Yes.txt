            I looked at a few different digital cameras before I chose the Olympus Camedia C-5050 Zoom Digital Camera. Sure there were smaller cameras available, ones that are easier to carry, but the bottom line to why I chose this one was the fact that its photos just seemed to be the best that I experienced. 

This camera is oh so easy to use. It features 5 megapixel resolutions, uses a 32 MB XD-picture card but also accepts both Smart Media and Compact Flash media cards. IBM Microdrive also works with the C-5050. You can focus anywhere from 35mm up to 105mm with the lense that it comes with and it will take optional telephoto as well as wide angle lenses with after market purchase.

The C-5050 has an optical viewfinder and shutter speeds ranging from 16 seconds to 1/2000 of a second. This can allow you to take time lapse photos or freeze a hummingbird in flight, something that I always wanted to do. The camera also has video and audio that rocks once you learn how to put to optimal use.

This camera is more for professionals than it is for anyone else but it is so easy to use that sometimes you will think you are a professional when you see the pictures you can take with it. The battery lasts up to around 350 pictures, at least that&#146s as many as I have taken before I recharge it. The camera also has semi-automatic and manual modes to improve your photographic skills if you care to try them.

With the simple press of a button you can pull up a menu that has easy to figure out icons to switch different focus modes for instance. There is a dial to rotate the different options into the selection area. Image settings, self timer, and flash modes can be accessed this way as well.

One of the funny things this camera does is let you know whether your lens cap is still on. If you turn the camera on before you take it off it beeps. Although I first found this annoying I ultimately decided that it would probably prevent me from running down the battery by leaving the camera on by mistake or accidentally turning it on.

I truly like the way it fits into my hands and have pretty much figured out that I only need one hand, the right, to make the camera do what I want it to. Another neat feature on this camera is the fold out LCD panel. It rotates up to 90 degrees for those times where I might hold the camera above my head. Think red carpet at the Oscars and lots of people in your way. For you moms, think school plays and other moms in front of you.

The C-5050 uses rechargeable nickel batteries and has an external charger but if you have to you can actually use regular AA batteries which I think is a fantastic feature.

The bottom line is that the C-5050 is a great camera that takes absolutely fantastic photos.
