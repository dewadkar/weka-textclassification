            Country living calls for a truck - our old truck is a '92 Sierra (GMC's name for a Silverado) Extended Cab, and we've grown quite attached to it and what it does (see Epinion on 1992 GMC Sierra 2500).  

It looks like 2001 is a very good year for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Extended Cab LS.  Now with two access doors that can be opened after the front doors, the loading ability is dramatically easier (especially for our elder family members) and a pure delight.  Except when I have to make three maneuvers to get my shopping cart in the right place to unload directly into the rear cabin area.  But - it's an improvement!

The new and improved cabin is great.  Bucket seats are an add on, but they are 6-way power adjust plus a manual lumbar support adjustment, and they are still reclining that are adjustable to your particular upright preference.  There is less 'bucket' to them, making the seats more like a chair and, to me, more comfortable.  With the bucket seats is a center console (lockable) with wide, open space. The rear seat bench has much more comfort and padding, and there are two adjustable headrests for the rear seat passengers.  This rear seat also folds up to allow for greater cargo room, if needed.

Standard features on the LS model include gauges clustered to the right of the very readable instrument panel for at-a-glance systems check, and a digital 'message board' that has MANY possible messages delivered by the new on-board computer, from the status of many systems to when you need to change your oil.  This vehicle you NEED a manual to operate!  

The dashboard is a much improved design over our 1992.  There is a smoother contour, which not only gives a roomier appearance, but the old style actually blocked some of the air conditioning vents to the driver, which has been remedied.  There is also added a few roof-mounted compartments, one just for glasses, one custom designed for a garage door opener, and another (undesignated)small one.  

Standard with the LS package is an AM/FM radio with CD player (cassette is extra).  The stereo sound is quite good, with several programmed audio settings as well as manual override.  

The security measures are extensive now.  First, an ignition design that, if someone tries to start the vehicle without the key, shuts off the fuel.  Secondly, entry into the vehicle other than using the key or remote unlock device triggers a horn-and-lights alarm.  This is also activated by pushing the panic button on the remote.  A third, and optional measure (which our dealer puts on ALL his vehicles), is a registration code etched into each glass pane in the truck, all with the same number.  The vehicle can be traced through this registration code, and a thief wanting to alter the VIN number for a fake title would have to replace all the glass in the truck to avoid it's being traced back.  This option, offered by Spectrum Services, warrants that if the vehicle is stolen and is declared a total loss because of the theft (never recovered, or recovered a total wreck) they will pay you $2,500.00.  

Our Silverado LS has the optional 5.3 liter V8 engine - rated at only 1mph higher than the smaller engine, but delivers more power when you need it.  It easily powers this truck through routine driving situations with quick response.  Handling is agile and stable on 16" tires.  

This truck is easily a "cowboy cadillac" - move up to the LT series with the leather seats and all the toys, and you might need two manuals just to figure out everything!
