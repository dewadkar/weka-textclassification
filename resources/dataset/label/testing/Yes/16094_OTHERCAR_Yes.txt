            The new Jeep Grand Jerokee is very smooth on the road.  It is great for driving your kids around, and it's also great for road trips.  There is space for 5 people.  Two seats up front, plus a bench seat in the back.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee has airbags(of course).  DO NOT LET KIDS UNDER 12 YEARS OF AGE RIDE IN THE FRONT SEAT.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee is great for you and your family.  Also, there is space for a dog in the back(if you want to bring it on a road trip).  The inside has very comfortable leather seats.  There are cup-holders, a radio, and a cd player.  The new Jeep Grand Cherokee also had Lumbar support for those achy backs!  This is a great SUV, and its not terribly expensive either!  The only real problem is it doesnt get the MPG that those new bugs do.  Buy it at your nearest Jeep Dealer today!<br><br>
