            Interested in purchasing a new vehicle? how about the new 2000 saturn sl2, this vehicle is top of the line quality for a new vehicle.My wife and I are very happy to drive such a wonderful vehicle. The saturn dealership was very helpful with the questions we had, and were also no problems like other dealerships around. The thing we like about the saturn Sl2 is the design that was changed for the 2000 year, and also the new safety features for infants for those of you have or expecting children someday.
The safety features we like were the safety locks in the back doors, and also the new features are the safety buckles located near the rear speakers to attach the new care seats.

The saturn sl2 has the get up and go engine with the 1.9 liter engine that 
picks up speed quickly when needed. also we liked about it was the quietness that is noticed when driving this vehicle, none other car can compare to the silence of the drive of the Saturn. The factory system is great in respect to any stereo system, the sound is like listening to a concert in front of you.The Saturn Sl2 also has a built in alarm system also included is fuel shut off if someone tries to start the vehicle. 

Anyone wanting to drive the best should drive away in an affordable car 
the saturn sl2 a great car!  <br><br>
