            I have owned and driven jeeps since my youth, CJ, XJ, YJ and now TJ.  The TJ has many new improvements over previous models.  (Too many don't want to list all) the soft top is easy to get up and down now and the frame and structure of the top is sturdier.  The ride is awesome compared to older versions, the coil spring suspension and other new suspension components make the new TJ better on or off the road.  I picked my 97 Jeep Sport 5 speed 6 cyl. up in Arizona and drove it back to Missouri.  I loved the trip and the ride in the Wrangler.  If you gotta have extreme comfort or something (which the Jeep was comfortable to ride in) then buy a Cadillac.  The 97 Jeep is great I have had mine for a short time (less than a year) but have not had any problems with it.  If you are a jeep owner or not a jeep owner the new TJ is and excellent Jeep and should take a ride in one or drive one and that should be all it takes to change your minds.  Anyway I love my Jeep and to mirror other reviews in this area.  Jeep owners are friendly, great people who will help you out and will definitely wave when they see other jeep owners on the road and the only other car owners that do that are Vette owners (I have one of those too, but that's not what this review is for)  Anyway there are literally tons and tons of aftermarket items that you can buy for the new Jeep so you can have it as stock or as radical as you want it (or as much as you can afford)  Good luck, if I see you in one on the highway be sure to throw a wave back.  :-)

PS  Don't buy a 4 cylinder of any year as they are dawgy and you will not be happy in the long run, no matter what you do to it.
