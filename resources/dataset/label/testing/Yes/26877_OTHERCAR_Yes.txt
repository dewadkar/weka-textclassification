            Today's family lifestyles have become complex, and our family, with dogs and kids, is no exception.  This is my first Dodge in 30 years of owning vehicles.  I've always been a GM man, so I didn't just jump into this 'fat, dumb and happy'.  After several months researching, shopping and test driving several 4-door pickups (and pseudo pickup wanna-be's), the candidates were soon reduced to a field of one: The Dakota Quad Cab.  

In real day-to-day life, the Dakota Quad Cab is truly a multi-functional vehicle.  I consider it the best of both worlds.  The 4-door interior is roomy and very comfortable, even in the rear seats.  The interior is SUV-like, virtually identical to a Durango, but behind the rear seats is where the SUV stops and the pickup truck begins!

Our Quad Cab (equipped with a bedliner and cap) suits just about any scenario comfortably, be it a weekend family jaunt out to the lake, hauling a load of mulch, taking the dogs to the groomers, a foursome with golf clubs or getting a load of groceries, etc.  The rear seats also fold up easily to provide a large storage area inside the cab.

After deciding on the Quad Cab, I spent several weeks researching and pondering over the available options before I ordered mine.  (There are a number of forums on the 'net with excellent info and feedback from existing Quad Cab owners) I strongly recommend considering the new Magnum 4.7 V-8.  It's a little thirsty, (16 to 18 MPG in everyday use) but well worth the additional power, smoothness and towing/hauling capacity.  Also recommended is the &quot;Tire &amp; Handling&quot; package, which includes a stabilizer bar that greatly enhances handling and drivability.  

I was surprised at a previous opinion questioning the Quad's stereo.  I ordered the RAZ option, the 8-speaker, top-of-the line AM/FM/Cassette/CD.  But even the lower tier stereos sound great.  They feature Infinity speakers and have enough bass to make your shoes come untied!  (Find some forums related to the Quad Cab and you'll see these same words from many other owners!!)   

It's hard to describe driving the Quad Cab.  It has such a big, heavy, quality, substantial 'feel' to it that I haven't experienced since the first time I drove a Toyota Land Cruiser!  The Quad Cab also has rack and pinion steering and I've heard it described as 'like driving the Town Car of pickups', which I thoroughly agree with.  (One should check out the bucket seats vs the standard bench seat.  We found the standard bench seat to be just as comfortable and more functional than the bucket option.)  The Quad Cab is just plain fun to drive!  

Besides being so multi-functional, the Dakota Quad Cab happens to look great too!  It draws a lot of attention and comments.  It's a vehicle you always feel good about getting into!  In fact, it's the first vehicle we've ever had that virtually every family member loves, ... even the in-laws .... and that's saying something!!

Please note, it's now early June and the 2001 model can now be ordered.  The 2001's will offer additional options and amenities, such as leather interior, push-button 4 wheel drive, etc.  

In my opinion, Dodge hit a 'home run' with the Dakota Quad Cab! I'm very, very happy with mine!
