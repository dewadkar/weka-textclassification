            When shopping for a good reliable <i>USED AUTOMOBILE</i> we have all been a little skeptical from time to time as to why that particular automobile you may be looking at is <i>For Sale</i>. Depending on the dealership you are making a purchase from your automobile may or may not have a warranty. Therefore, you want to be sure you have made a correct choice and are not getting yourself into someone else's repair problems. 

My advice to you is to research!  The internet is an easy way to shop for information without leaving your home.  <b><i><a href=''>http://www.EPINIONS.COM</a></b></i> is an excellent source to help in researching a product or a service, by reading the reviews of others who actually own a particular product that you may be looking for.  

For those of you who may be considering purchasing a great reliable economical used car. The <b><i>1993 Saturn SL1</b></i> gets my highest recommendation.

Sure I was really skeptical when I first made this purchase, because this car was used.  Honestly, I have to admit from my own experience with this car, <i>I also consider myself another <b>Satisfied Saturn Customer!</i></b> 

Before I had written this review I had read and rated other reviews on <b>SATURNS</b> and have found them all to be as satisfied.  These reviews prompted me to write this review about my Saturn and not think that I was the only one fortunate enough to have found <i>a one of a kind <b> Great Deal!</b></i>.

Our <b>Saturn SL1</b> has provided my family with 4 years of reliability, comfort and minimal maintenance expenses.  I liked the fact that this car is a 4 cylinder and has a 5 Speed Transmission, especially the way the gas prices have been rising steadily, this Saturn has saved money on gas by giving me approximately 32 miles to a gallon (city) and a good 37+ miles to a gallon on the Highway.

As it stands right now this car has over 130,000 plus miles on the odometer and it is still running as well as the first day I drove it off the lot. Keeping the oil changed regularly as recommended and bringing it in for a tune up has kept the engine running strong.

For a small car it is comfortable, actually able to seat a family of 5, if your children are small.  There is enough room in the back seat for three car seats for my grandchildren to sit comfortable and still be securely buckled in. As far as adults, I have found just two adults can sit comfortable in the back seat of this car.  Another feature I love about this car is it a 4 door and has child locks so my grandchildren can not open the doors as the vehicle is in motion.  The automatic seat belts guarantees me that my front seat passenger is wearing their seat belt the minute the door is closed and car has started.  

<i>The <b>Saturn SL1</b> has many features, such as air conditioning, AM/FM stereo cassette, sun roof, comfortable cloth seats, anti-lock brakes, a drivers side air bag, automatic seat belts, tilt steering wheel, child locks, and child proof windows, the back seats fold down for extra trunk space, lifetime rust through on any part, scratch resistant paint and dent proof side panels.</i>

Most of all, having a guarantee directly from Saturn, if a part rust completely through Saturn will replace the part.
 
Saturns are considered to be one of the most safest vehicles on the road as well as very reliable with low maintenance.
