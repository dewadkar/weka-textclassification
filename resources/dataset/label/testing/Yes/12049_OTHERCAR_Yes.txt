            I bought my Silver/Red S2K about 3 weeks ago. I was one of the lucky ones, got it for MSRP. If you look around you will see that is a great price.
Well have 900 miles on it and I love it , and my wife loves it. I drive it almost every day and people just give it looks. My BMW sales person who owns an M3 drove it. He loved it and said except for the M coupe he loved this the best. better than the Z3.
I think it rides nice and lots of power. You get use to the sound after a while and I have learned to love it.


There are a few things I would change line, the rear window should be glass, no clock, no glove box.

Every thing else I love and it kicks butt and takes names.
I have read almost every review and they love it.
So what do I say &quot;get one before there all gone&quot;<br><br>
