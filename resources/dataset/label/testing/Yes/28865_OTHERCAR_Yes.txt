            I love this little camera, it takes great pictures,you don't have to be a pro to use and the product will last for ever,with just a little care.
the kids,(teenagers)can use it and theres no worry that will break it,and there pictures are great to.
the only thing really missing is a zoom lens that will zoom into space however,I find that I really don't need it.
I feel that if your looking for a camera that will last you for a long time but do not what to mortgage the house this is a great buy, keep your eyes open for sales and save even more.<br><br>
