            A truly amazing car.  No car on the planet can match its fun performance and handling.  There are faster cars, yes, but BMW is not all about speed.  

There are a few rattle problems around the front side windows.  It appears to be a common problem.  But it's not a big deal.

Don't feel compelled to buy the larger engine - the 323 (and 325) have a lot of power, and after a few months of break in you should notice significant more power from under the hood.  No kidding.

But don't let the base price of appx. $26k fool you.  Expect to pay $35k or more for a car loaded with decent options.  But it's well worth it.  Just look at all the magazine reviews and tests - it's the safest car in its class with an extremely low cost of ownership.  Plus BMW's have great resale value.  You will pay more for this car, but it'll last a long time and be worth a surprising amount down the road when you sell it.

A note on some options...

Leather vs Leatherette - I went with leatherette.  It's a lot more durable than leather and most people can't tell the difference.

I do recommend the Premium Package which unfortunately if you get the larger engine forces you to get leather.  If I had gone with the larger engine I would have taken the leather and been happy (but just had to spend a lot more time cleaning and keeping the leather in shape).

I didn't get the Sport Package, which I regret sometimes but I enjoy the standard ride and am glad I have all season tires.  The SP comes with sport tires which are no good in the winter weather so you have to swap wheels or not drive during the winter.  So I chose the simplest route and just keep the standard suspension.  Plus I think the "standard" steering wheel is much more handsome and the buttons on it easier to use than the sport steering wheel.

Xenon is great.  Heated seats are well worth it.  Harmon Kardon system is well worth the money (unless you want to spend time installing an aftermarket sound system, in which case you could probably do better).  

Go buy this car!
