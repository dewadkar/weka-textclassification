            Dimage X, no doubt, the smallest 3x digital out there.
Looks shiny, cute, and certainly goes every where.
If you are looking for a convenient digital camera to take wherever you go, whether it is someone's birthday party, pizza parlor, amusement park, or just a walk in the park, this is it!

Speedwise, it's pretty fast, bright flash, too!

So, what's the fine line?? Image quality, my friend, image quality. If you are a first timer to digital or even otherwise, pictures will look pretty good to you, coming from such a small camera...but wait...if you compare pictures with other 2 mp digitals, it's a different story..sorry to disappoint you..but it's true..

As I always do, I did a benchmark test of Dimage X with Olympus C-700 (acclaimed as the world's smallest 10x zoom 2 mp digital camera. Palm size, very compact). 

When I compared the same shot taken from the two cameras with same angles, same zoom, etc. I realized what was missing in Dimage X.  It was the WOW! factor.

Photos from C-700 are very, very sharp, accurate colors, and they seem to pop out of the screen. Dimage X photos are good but no WOW! there.

Would I keep the Dimage, I bought? Probably, because of the portability factor. If I want some just "occasion" photos which I would have missed without a camera on my waist, this camera would be the one to do the job. Canon S200 which will be out in about a week or so, is smaller than Dimage X, but it's ex (not much difference, really), but it will be slightly heavier. Picture quality of Canon would be good if it is like its predecessor (Canon Powershot s110), if the reviews are correct. Since nobody has seen this camera, we may have to wait and see another week.

Well, take a serious look at this camera. Check it out, personally, physically, and you may fall in love with it.

Also, when you are checking out cameras, take a look at the Olympus C-700. In my opinion, it's the best buy. It's a little camera which would fool you very easily unless you take close look at it. It's loaded with features, it's amazing how that many features, in such a small size, for such a bargain price was made possible.

Well, gotta go! Good luck snapping!
