            The Lexus GS400 is a purebred sports sedan, blending the best of a powerful V8 and the luxury typical Lexus� have to offer.  It is the only serious competition to the long time &quot;King of Sports Sedans&quot; the BMW 540i.  Lexus introduced the GS as a sports sedan large enough to accommodate 5 comfortably, and still be a competent performer.  The previous generation�s GS300 did just that, but left drivers unfulfilled when it came down to outright road fun.  In 1998, Lexus delivered a new engine, a 4.0 Liter V8, with the name GS 400 behind it, and the title of being the fastest Lexus on the road.  Exceeding all the standards the previous GS set, the Second Generation encompassed the best of two very different worlds: Sport, and Luxury.

The GS 400�s interior is eye catching.  Real wood trim accents straddle the center console and highlight the door panels are a bit too small for my liking, but nonetheless are real wood.  The center console rises steeply and with the GPS Navigation option, a screen is the center of attention.  The shifter is also accented with wood.  The seats are comfy with more than plenty of room.  During spirited driving they are sufficient in keeping the driver planted.  Rear seat room is spacious though the headrests do tend to get in the way of the driver�s inside rearview mirror.  The sound system included boasts a 10 inch subwoofer in the rear deck which probably leans more towards the elegant refined luxury half of the car, rather than the aggressive, bass-thumping, V8 Sporty nature of the car.  The Stereo is controlled mainly with the GPS screen in addition to the trip calculator and Air Conditioning, which is fully automatic dual zone.   The Instrument cluster is separated into three pods, each deeply receded into the dashboard backlit for clear visible numbers during the day, and a high tech indiglo look at night.  The steering wheel has the standard controls along with a cell phone remote control mechanism and buttons for shifting up and down in manual shift mode.  All windows are auto-up/down, probably the most useful amenity in the entire car, sorely missed when driving lesser vehicles.  The remote unlock does not have an incredible range, though it does serve its purpose well, and can even roll all the windows down and open the sunroof.  Highest on the novel feature list is the automatic telescoping steering wheel when you insert the key in the ignition.  The wheel comes from its receded position to greet you like a handshake.  Memory Seating has two locations and works in conjunction with the steering wheel.  Though when in reverse the right side mirror does NOT tilt down, I guess they saved that for the LS400 exclusively.  The Auto-leveling Xenon High Intensity Discharge headlights are very useful, when starting the car, they are at they�re highest position... after a second of calibration they auto level so that they do not blind oncoming drivers, even when you are sporting a trunk full of luggage and three passengers in the rear seat, the headlights remain level.  If you pop the hood you can see the levelers with the bubbles inside used for the calibration, quite innovative.

The exterior of the GS is either a love it or hate it kind of styling.  The overall appearance of the car evokes emotions of power and intimidation.  The hood is muscularly shaped, and the quad headlights unique (unique as in NOT like a Mercedes-Benz�s).  At night the Xenon headlights, a bright white with a hint of blue, combine with amber foglights for an look exclusive to GS400�s.  The rear window has conjured a lot of controversy, it slopes down giving the rear of the car a short overhang look similar to a sports coupe, but looks a little strange on a burly Four-door.  The Tail lights are also exclusively GS400, with nothing on the road yet to even come close to looking similar.  (The soon to come Lexus IS300 has hints of GS-styling)  The Rims make a Five spoke bold statement, but most GS owners aren�t exactly proud to say they have *only* 16 inch rims/tires, even with the option of the 17 inch rim/tire package.  

The engine delivers a smooth linear torque curve, with beautiful acceleration.  The car doesn�t throw you around while driving aggressively, the cabin is almost separated from the rest of the car.  A Dead quiet ride while cruising, and a beautiful note from the engine when called for.  Steering is good, it feels Lexus-like, albeit a little too detached from the road.  The engine accelerates the car to 60 mph in a short 5.7 seconds, though it feels only like you reached 30.  I realize the car is a luxury vehicle, but it also has a very potent V8, when I drop the hammer I want to feel like I�m in a 6G centrifuge.  The GS accelerates TOO smoothly that it saps a little from the fun.  I think Lexus should show a little more Sports than Sedan in this case.  In the turns the GS is fun, but its almost impossible to hide that the car weighs nearly 4000 pounds, I don�t care if you�re Enzo Ferrari the sheer size and weight of the car show. Overall though, minus the body roll and the weight, the rear wheels do a good job of pushing the suspension through the twisties.  Shifting gears manually through the steering-wheel mounted controls was easy enough, but wasn�t as fun as say a shift knob controlled Tiptronic.  And in manual mode, the gearbox doesn�t drop into first gear, for some reason Lexus Engineers decided it would be best to let it only go as low as second gear.  Rumors of a Lexus GS 400 Sport have been stirring, with upgraded styling, larger and more low profile tires, and a more aggressive  suspension.  Look for it in Detroit or Los Angeles at the Auto Show this January.

With all that said and done, you had a competent sports sedan (The old GS 300) transformed into a refined beast that you can claim the fastest way to get Five people from 0-60 and sip a hit of double latte at the same time.
