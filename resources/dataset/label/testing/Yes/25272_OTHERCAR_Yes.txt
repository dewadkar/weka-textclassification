            Ok, I'm going to say this right up front. This is the BEST vehicle I have ever owned. I'm going to give this truck five stars and if you look at my profile you'll see I never give anything a full five stars. This is how impressed I am with the performance of this truck.

First, a little background. We purchased this truck new in early 1995 from Tasch in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. It was a regular cab with automatic transmission mated to a 175 horse 3.9L V6 engine. The only options it had was the auto tranny and the V6. Other than that it was bone stock, but it was a sport model, which included a cloth interior, tape deck with four speakers, chrome wheels and thats about it.

I owned this truck four years and the odometer read 127,000 miles when I finally traded it in for my Ford. This little pickup saw a LOT of highway in my college days.

In the four years I owned the truck it cost me about 600 dollars (not including oil changes, spark plugs and the usual items). The additional expense was for rotors, a thermostat and a breather. The rotors were the only major component ever to be replaced on the truck and this was due to  NORMAL wear and tear. These are the ONLY repairs ever done to this vehicle.

Performance: With 175 ponies behind a light vehicle such as this it managed a pretty good clip. The V8 would have been better but the V6 has more than enough power for every-day driving. The truck was exceptional for highway use and when you put it down the engine howled like a banshee and took off.

Maintenance: This truck you have to jack up or run on ramps to change the oil. It uses a cheap standard air cleaner and the plugs are easy to get to. For being a newer vehicle the engine bay was very clean, with little computer junk cluttering up the place. The high-rise intake topped with Holley fuel-injection gave it a performance look to the engine which I like better than the &quot;covered in plastic&quot; look you get now. Heck, on the new Mercedes I don't even think you can see the engine under all the plastic shrouds. It had six-bolt rims (unusual for a light truck) and 15 inch tires, putting it in the passenger car class of tire-prices. 400 bucks will get you a good set of rubber all the way around.

Snow: For a two-wheel drive truck this thing would crawl around like crazy. One night we had a major snow storm, so me, not being the sharpest knife in the drawer, went for a ride. I went to a bank parking lot and there, on the flat, it would push snow from drifts to the top of the hood with good tires before it finally gave up. I was impressed. I backed up and took a run for it and drove her home. Now the other side of that coin is if you have to stop on even the slightest incline when it's slippery... well, you had better just pull out and hope no other car is coming for the next 15 minutes as you coax it along.

Body: Rock solid. The metal on this truck is stiff. Very stiff. The tailgate is light but sturdy enough to hold a 300 pound gas pump and two rather large guys. The paint is very good and resists damage and the red color that I had did not fade. I peeled off a sticker that had been on the truck for almost four years with no differentiation between the colors under it and near it. The bumpers are painted black and they do fade to some degree. The only rust developed where the hot exhaust would blow back on the corner of the bumper. In this area it got a little rot but just on the surface and only on the bumper, not on the body. The box is double-walled so dents on the inside don't show on the outside. There are no tie-down hooks in the bed, which can be problematic when you want to haul over-sized loads.

Other: The interior is spacious and comfortable. One drawback was that the cup holders on these older Dodge truck are way over by the passenger. It was kind of a reach. There isn't much storage behind the seat so you have to get a cover or a cap for the box if you plan on hauling things and keeping them dry. With the windows down the air blows in and smacks you right upside the head. Visibility is very good with thin A and B pillars. The lights are bright but tend to burn out from side to side more often than what they should. I have talked to several people with the same problems. 

Almost all V6 Dodge truck engines will start to rattle a bit at 30,000 miles. It's the timing chain (yes... chain, not belt). I ran mine to 127K and never had a problem with it and others have done the same.

They ride like trucks. Nothing fancy.
