            I baught this car in October for $12,000 out the door.  I orginally wanted a Jetta, then I wanted a Civic.  I then settled with the Elantra.  I don't regret my choice at all.  VW quality is nothing like is used to be, and 2001 civic I read was on the down side too.  I use this car to go up to the mountains a lot.  The drive is about 3 hours. When I first started going I thought it could have just a little bit more power.  Until I started using 93 oct gas.  The change in gas greatly change the performance for climbing mountains.  For regular driving their is no need to use anything other then regular gas.  It drive as good as card that are twice as much.  I have the keyless entry witch works from quite a distance.  The heated mirrors are very nice.  The car's heater and defrosters only take a few minutes to warm up in the coldest of weather.  I have not really been able to test the A/C yet since it is Feb. I have used it a few times though, because the car became to hot inside from the heater.  I have seen A few complaints about the trunks size.  I have been able to fit a complete 5 peice drum set in the rear.  I right now I have a medium sized printer box, large rubber made container, and a few crates packed in the truck.  I think the trunk is more than enough.  The stereo sounds great for a stock system.  I think the layout of where everything is in the car is great.  The cup holders are in great places.  The guages are easy to see.  The radio is easy to change with out taking your eyes off the road.  This is also a huge amount of compartment space.  It has a deep 2 part center console compartment.  A driver side change compartment.  A misc drive side compartment(Most likey for ciggerette pack) Under the radio deep compartment.  Large gloove box.  2 from cup holder.  Adjustible steering wheel. Now for the problems.  Their has been a buzz when the radio is playing.  I think it is the arm rest.  The weather stripping on the rear driver side door is coming down.  Both of these I'm have fixed with my next oil change.  The rear seat belt also seems to sometimes fall on the rockerpanel.  So you have to pay attention or might scrape up the paint on the rockerpanel.  I have 10k miles on the car and I'm been really happy with it so far.
