            Hello Everyone,

  I am the proud owner of the Olympus E-10 and personally am not looking to sell this one anytime soon.  This is my 5th Digital Camera and the Olympus E-10 replaced my pervious camera "Canon G1" and I never looked back.  The Olympus capabilities are so much more powerful then my pervious cameras.  A lot of people complain about the fixed 140mm lens on the camera.  Really its not that bad because any dust that gets on the CCD could cause picture and capturing problems so you always have to worry about dust entering your camera.  Fixed, you never have to worry about it.  But here are some of the features of the camera that I enjoy.
  
  The 4x fixed zoom lens is powerful.  Combined with the 3x Telephoto lens Olympus offers for the E10 you get a 420mm zoom!  Thats crazy!  The Auto focus is incredably fast.  No just from object to object, I mean even from macro to scenic shots its focuses in less then 1/3rd of a second.  I couldnt believe it when I used it.  The capability of using two different types of media.  Compact Flash and SmartMedia, and you have them in the camera at the same time and switch between them with a button on the camera itself.  All the information in the view finder is fantastic.  It is realtime display of your shutter speed, if its out of focus and everything else, more information in your eyepiece then most point and shoot cameras have on there LCD display.  Another little thing that I know people have always wanted to do but couldnt was the ability of real date and time stamping.  Well this camera has it.  Doesn't stamp your file, it stamps the picture!  Not too many digital cameras can do that.
   There is so much to know about this camera.  I know that I do no regret in any way leaving my Canon G1 to the Olympus E-10.  It just out preforms it in every way.
