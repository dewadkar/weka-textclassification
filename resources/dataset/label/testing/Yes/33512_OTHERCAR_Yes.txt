            This is my first new car review, so I am sure that it will not be as polished as the other reviews in this category. I have had this car for one week at the time of this review and here are my impressions so far.

Exterior-

I have always been a fan of the Maxima, but this is the first one that I have ever owned. While many people think that the Maxima is awkward in its execution, it is this subtlety that attracted me to this car. Redesigned in 2000, the new Maxima had a fresh appearance, but it was not so radically different from the older model as often happens when a new model is introduced. I will leave it up to you to decide if this is a plus or a minus. Fit and finish seem to be typical of Japanese cars. The gaps appear to be even all the way around and the paint seems to practically glow. The dual exhaust tip is a nice touch, but I would actually prefer the dual exhaust like the Altima 3.5S.

Interior-

Let me preface this section by letting you know that my former car was a 2001 Nissan Sentra SE 2.0. Obviously, the Maxima has much more interior space than the Sentra. Sitting in the rear seats is no longer an experience in contortion for the average size adult. In a side by side comparison with many other cars in this class that I was considering (Millenia, Camry, Passat) the Maxima had much more interior space.
There are 4 cup holders (2 in front, 2 in rear), 2 12v outlets, a large center armrest/storage compartment, large map pockets, 8-way power drivers seat and 4-way power passenger seat. The dials are easy to read and are well lit at night. Something that I applaud Nissan for is getting rid of the red marker that is found on so many speedos at "55." I have a friend who is colorblind and this is something that he has complained about for years on many cars.
While it is true that there could be more lateral support in the seats, I have found the seats to be very comfortable, even on a long trip (I spent 9 hours in this car yesterday). Again, fit and finish seem to be excellent. Mine is a GLE version with enough leather to outfit 2 cows. The leather is soft and supple and I have not found a loose seam yet. One thing that I really miss about my Sentra is the amount of interior storage. While my Sentra had a place especially for my cell phone, my Maxima does not. Also, there is a storage compartment in the dash of the Sentra as well as a center armrest/storage compartment. The Maxima only has the armrest compartment.

Power-

What can I say here, this car will absolutely move when you stomp the gas. The 3.5L 255hp V6 is the only engine choice, so even if you get the base model, you are still going to get a lot of power. Engine noise is at a minimum. Fuel economy is 20 and 26. So far, I have averaged 24mpg. Not bad, but I will admit that I have only used Premium fuel so far, something I do not like, but Nissan recommends. 

Handling-

Most of my driving experience so far has been in the city or on the interstate, so I have not been on any twisty roads. The ride is very smooth and the steering seems to be very responsive.

Overall-

This is my first fully optioned car. Like I said, I have had it just over a week and so far, I have not been disappointed. While I do miss my cellphone holder and dash compartment, the Maxima more than compensates in overall room and comfort.
