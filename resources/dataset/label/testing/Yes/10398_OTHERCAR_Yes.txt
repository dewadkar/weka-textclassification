            The Chrysler Town and Country Minivan is the largest van with the most features of any on the market.  It rides like a car, and the interior is luxurious and comfortable.  The leather seats are a dream to sit in.  It is well-made,extremely dependable and drives like a luxury car.  On the highway, the Town and Country gets up to 23 mpg with the 3.8L V-6.  In-town mileage is not bad at around 15-17.  The luxury, appointments, and roominess outclass the Japanese minivans considerably.  The only negatives are a bit of road noise on the highway and a long turning radius.  The price of a new Town and Country may put it out of range for many people, so my advice is to buy a low-mileage used one. That is what we did.  We found a 1995 one year ago with only 25,000 miles on it.  It was just like new, and has been wonderful to own and travel in.<br><br>
