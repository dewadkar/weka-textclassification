            I have been the proud owner of a 1995 Del Sol SI (125hp) for the last 8 months. I picked it up in desperation, actually; came to the end of a lease on a ;95 Civic EX, and financially wasn't ready for a brand new ride...THANK GOD!! 
Okay, it squeaks a bit with the top off, (or on, depending on the pavement)and the  roof seals may leak a bit in heavy rain, but it handles like nobody's business.Contact your Honda dealer regarding warranty seal info; they may replace the seals comp. even if your warranty has expired. There is AMPLE room for my 6'1' self, and I'd swear the seats confirm to the rear of whomever's behind the wheel. The most comfortable, yet hard-drive-supporting seats I've ever been in, AND the mileage is great. There's not as much punch as the VTEC(160hp), but this ain't no slouch. You need to get the revs up to 5,000rpm, and with creative shifting, you won't be caught at the back of the weekend warrior pack. 
To me, the one piece targa top is the best feature. Nothing beats the open air motoring in this ride, coupled with the safety and assurance of the top in place when you're done tooling around town. The car is almost too easy to maintain; I'm at 90,000, so it's timing belt and major service time, then oil changes every 3,000 till it's time for another service (roughly $600 for the 90,000 check up; hey, I'm in Miami, s'how it is). 
A highly underrated vehicle; consider it the wild child cousin of the '92-95 Civic SI. If you're single, a couple w/out a family, or if you want a nice little change from the family truckster on the weekends, by all means pick one up. 
Hints; upgrade the stereo, run better rubber on the 14&quot; rims, or upgrade to 15&quot;s, change the oil and timing belt/water pump on high mileage (90 grand +)Sols, watch the brakes, cause this generation of Civic-based cars had a few issues in this regard, and enjoy. 
Remember, all else aside, there ain't nothin' else like it on the road today..<br><br>
