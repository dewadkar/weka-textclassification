            Having a family of 4 and the passion for travel, I wanted a large but comfortable vehicle.  After test driving several SUVs I decided on the Expedition for several reasons.  Foremost, I love the ride and handling.  The Expedition can &quot;turn-on-a-dime!&quot;  That's no joke, I have turned a complete circle within a three lane space.  The steering is very easy; sitting still or moving it takes no effort to turn this vehicle.  You can turn into a parking place with the ease of a smaller vehicle.  Oh yes, it fits in a standard garage too!  Another great feature I love and wouldn't know what to do without is the over-head heating and cooling vents.  The rear seat has its own control knobs making it easy for the kids to set their own temperature.  One of my personal favorite features is the cup holders (4 in front), now how's that for a place to put your drinks?  There is also two holders in the rear seats pull-down arm rest, placed in the center of the seat...very handy.  And they didn't leave out the third seat, it too has cup holders placed on each side of the vehicle next to the window.  Now for the power plant, I opted for the 5.4 liter Triton.  I believe it's powerful enough to pull just about anything.  Just out-right performance it's quick and fast for a large vehicle.  One of the very few things I'm not quite satisfied with is the third seat option.  It is very difficult to remove and I am 6 feet tall and weigh 200 lbs, so mom don't try to take the seat out by your self!  It's heavy and very hard to handle, yet it's a nice thing to have.  The fuel mileage is what you would expect out of a large vehicle...bad.  I get around 11 to13 in the city and 18 to 21 highway.  Maintenance wise, we have had a few difficulties.  There has been two recalls on this vehicle; one for the gas tank gage not reading accurately and one for the lug nuts coming lose.  We experienced some noise problems when it was new, the front-end bushings had cracked and were making an annoying squeaking sound.  It took several trips to the garage before they fixed it.  If I were to describe how this vehicle drives I would have to say GREAT!  It's truly in the luxury class of SUVs.  I have taken it on 1,600 mile trips with out being worn out.  I would recommend this vehicle to the big and tall person, but a small person would feel right at home as well.  My wife loves to drive it, at first she didn't think it would handle very easily, but after driving it the first time I had to beg her to give it back.  I would have to give this SUV a big thumbs up.   <br><br>
