            Chevrolet says it all.  I own an '83 Corvette which has 265,000 miles on it.  I've changed the oil every 3,000 miles and done nothing more than routine maintenance.  Chevy has been building quality V8's ever since I could remember.  This car has the characteristics of a muscle car and a digital car of the future.  A power plant of muscle and intelligence.  You have the ability to change it's driving mentality from cruiser to dragster in the touch of a button.  With it's press button adjustable suspension and traction control the driver has complete control.  Find out why this car has been an American icon since it's birth.
