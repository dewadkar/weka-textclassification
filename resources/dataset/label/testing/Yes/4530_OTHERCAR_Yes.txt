            I have been selling digital cameras for about 2.5 years and this is the one I like best.  It has just about all the great features of Fuji's other great cameras (4700, 4800, 6800) plus just a few really nice improvements.

The best thing they have done is to improve the image contrast.  Pictures come out brighter and seem a little sharper than on previous models.  Fuji also added a true macro capability, which the other models mentioned claim to have but in practice do not.  This model has added full manual controls as well.  The user interface is also improved.

The only drawbacks I have noticed is that they reduced the battery capacity a bit from 1300 MAh to 1100 MAh.  On the upside this battery is also used in the Pentax Optio 330 & 440, so it may be a bit easier to find in a pinch.

One more thing I wasn't really happy with is that Fuji left that wonderful docking cradle out of the package.  It should cost about 55 USD for one.  It is definitely a good idea to get this, especially if you are not one who loves to fiddle with cables everytime you go to your computer.

It's a good one.  If you are looking to go digital and you have the cash get this one.  Also don't be a cheapskate and try to go without a camera case.  Spend 20 bucks and get a Lowpro D-Res 20AW.  It fits the camera perfectly and looks good.

By the way I quit my job selling Cameras at the store on Fulton Ave in Sacramento.  And I still recommend this camera.  (and that store)
