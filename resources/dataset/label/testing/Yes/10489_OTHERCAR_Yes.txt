            After driving a minivan, I was skeptical of this vehicle I had never heard of.  My husband researched Daewoo on the internet and found this Korean company is one of the largest corporations in the world.  With the help of Porsche Company, Daewoo built a smooth and reliable engine and transmission.

We drove our piece of junk minivan to the local Daewoo dealership and soon found that we were able to look at cars without a salesman breathing down our neck.  The questions we asked were met with sound answers.

While we originally went to look at their station wagon, we soon discovered the roominess of the sedan.  With only one child we really didn't need a mini van any longer.

The car itself is wonderful, the fit and finish on the inside is superb, with everything in a logical place.  We had only one problem in trying to figure out how the wind shield wipers worked, but we soon found the way.  It was different, but aren't most things these days.

The standard package is great.  We weren't planning on paying extra money for an AC, but with the Daewoo it was standard.  We specifically wanted a standard transmission and were excited that too was standard.  The transmission is very smooth, but a little stiff on cold mornings.

What we are really impressed with is the gas mileage.  The sticker said we could expect 22 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway.  They really need to re-evaluate that.  On a recent 300 mile trip to the beaches of South Carolina, we paid close attention to the mileage and our figures showed an impressive 33.5 mpg on the highway.  Our city mileage is above their rates too.  We average about 25 to 28 mpg in the city.

Over all it is a beautiful car and I wouldn't trade it in unless I was trading it in on another Daewoo.<br><br>
