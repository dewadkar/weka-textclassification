            My '95 is the second Nissan pickemup I've owned. I'm a painting contractor in Colorado &amp; my trucks get worked pretty hard. Mine has also been driven to Baja twice, Phoenix, Vegas, California, &amp; upstate Michigan.
At 117K miles it's reliable enough for me to trust on road trips. I'd buy a new one in a heartbeat if I could afford one right now! 
One caveat, at least for the '95. The 4 cylinder is a bit of a dog on big hills; I would get a 6 cylinder if that was important to me. Other than that, its sturdy &amp; well built &amp; I've even towed a kit car down to Phoenix in August with it, no problems.<br><br>
