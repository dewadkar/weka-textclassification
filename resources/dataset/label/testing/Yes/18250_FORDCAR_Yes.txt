            I owned a 1991 Escort GT for about 7 years.  I felt it offered the best band for the buck when I bought it back in 91 for under $10,800, tax included (a Civic Si was about $4 grand more).  Hey - I was a poor college student.

I loved the powertrain, a Mazda 1.8 liter DOHC 16 valve design. It offered 127 hp and 114 ft-lbs of torque, plenty for such a light vehicle.  The 5 speed made for quick sprints, especially off the line.  The hatchback design offered tons of utility, I don't understand why more Americans don't agree.  It gave me 107,000 miles with no powertrain problems.

I hated the general quality control.  The gas guage was off from day one.  The motorized-mice seat belts failed regularly, and there were more squeeks and rattles than I could count.

Driving this thing was a lot of fun.  The suspension was firm, and it had 15&quot; alloys with 60 series H-rated tires.  That made for sporty handling, though the ride was a bit stiff.  The engine was loud at high revs, but it was so much fun I didn't care.

When it was totalled (by a careless Cherokee driver), I still got $3,000 from her insurance company.  So 7 years and 107k miles later, it still held 28% of its original value.

Overall, it's not a bad ride for a college student looking for a bargain.  You'd really have to go to a 2 year old Honda or Toyota for the same price.  Ford dropped the Mazda powertrain, so I can't comment on the newer engines.  The Focus looks pretty nice, though.<br>
