            I ordered my 1996 Saturn SC2 from the factory and have enjoyed 6 trouble-free years of fun with it. I know these reviews are all highly subjective, so let me explain my situation so you know where I'm coming from: single male, 5'11", slim, and always wanted a coupe with popup headlights since I was a kid. If you have kids, are over 6 feet tall or weigh 200 pounds or more, this car might not fit you.

RELIABILITY
In 6 years, I have only had to pay for regular maintenance. Oil changes every 3K, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary or out of line with what good preventive maintenance is all about, and I take preventive maintenance seriously.

I did replace the metal strips along the door windows after 4 years; they started peeling so I bought a good set of used ones. Heading into my 7th year I had to replace the horn, that's my first true servicing due to component failure. I expect to have to replace some more things as the car's age starts to show. Hey, it's better than a loan payment every month.

My beloved SC2 was stolen in its 4th year and recovered, so it's been partially rebuilt. Haven't had any reliability trouble related to that horrific experience. This car has been totally reliable for me.

DEALERSHIP EXPERIENCE
Definitely a cut above other brands I've owned. I usually feel respected and valued as a customer, and I get thorough answers to my questions. If anything, I wish my salesman had been more eager to sell me options, because he was so laid back and polite I didn't realize how worthwhile some of the options were--like the fog lights and the traction control system, which I've always regretted not getting.

DRIVING
I love the SC2 for its light weight, low center of gravity and high torque engine that makes even routine errands pleasurable. With the 5spd manual tranny, it's FUN--not "fast" so much as zippy in the lower gears. Sadly, Saturn has never fulfilled the true potential of the SC2, it could have been a real sports car for another couple thousand bucks--give it a turbocharged 4 or a V6 and it would be a rocket. As it is, the inline 4 is one of the more noisy engines you will encounter--but I don't mind it at all, I hate cars that run so quietly you can't tell if you've stalled while at a stop.

The performance of the car improved dramatically when I replaced the horrid Firestone Firehawk GTA tires with new ones. Those Firehawks were the most dangerous tires I've ever driven, they should never have been paired with the SC2. Too hard a compound to grip in all but the most hot, dry climates. I once got stuck in a parking lot with only 2 inches of snow on the ground! I recommend owners of SC2s buy a set of winter tires unless you have the traction control option--I've heard great things about that. In my case Toyo Observes and Michelin Pilot Alpins have been good winter tires for me in this car. For summer driving, I've had very good luck with Dunlop D60A2 and Bridgestone RE730s.

ERGONOMICS
The '96 SC2 is a mixed bag regarding how the cockpit fits the driver. On one hand, this body design of the SC2 (there have been two less unique styles since) features the best visibility of any car I've ever seen. It's like driving a greenhouse! Not one blind spot anywhere. Try that in any other coupe for any price. Other good things include a leather steering wheel that feels really good to grip, controls for the radio and heating that you can operate by touch instead of looking, and a really wide range of intensity for the cockpit lighting at night that is sure to accommodate everyone's night vision needs. The cruise control is right on the steering wheel, very usable.

A couple bad points on the controls are the turn signal stalk and the horn. The turn signal stalk is too far away from the wheel to be used easily, nor is it long enough. And the horn is a joke of bad interface design--instead of a large target area all over the center of the steering column, you have to find and press one of two little buttons. The Japanese have no trouble fitting good horns into the center of their steering wheels, why can't Saturn? The air bag is no excuse.

OTHER
The plastic body panels are as good as claimed. Mileage for me runs higher than what the EPA estimated, I have gotten over 40mpg on the highway going about 65! Mixed driving of town and country yields a consistent 31mpg. I liked the clutch feel when new, right now I'm at 92K and have yet to notice wear on the clutch or the brake pads needing replacing. No alternator trouble like my dad has had on his '95 SL2 (which has also been a great car, btw).

CONCLUSION
I wrote this review after 6 years of blissful ownership because I know some of you are looking for a used car and might consider this Saturn model. Those plastic panels keep them looking younger than other cars. For me, the 1996 SC2 was the pinnacle of refinement for the SC series before it was made to look like a pathetic copy of a Japanese style reject in 1997 and later. I will never sell this car unless the frame should rust away. How many cars will you own in your life where you are not even tempted by newer cars on the market in its price range or a little higher?
