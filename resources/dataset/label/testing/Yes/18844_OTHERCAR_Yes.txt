            I have your basic Monte Carlo with no leather interior or sunroof, but I must say that this car hauls some major butt for the price I paid.

Being only a V6 engine, when you put the pedal to the metal this car tips back and just whales like crazy.Hit the accelerator twice and the thing will whip you back a couple times.I raced this thing against many other cars with V6's and it beat the crap out of them.I beat Honda's, Hyundahi's with turbos in them, Cadillacs (and those are V8's!) and many more cars.

The model that I purchased was a 3.1 liter which gives me awesome gas mileage of 28 on the highway! Much better than my old car, an oldsmobile station wagon from the 1980's.

Another benefit with the model I purchased it the keyless entry system.No more fumbling with keys to get the door open (especially in dark areas where you can't fit your key into the door and you end up scratching your paint).

Some options you can get go well with this car, but something I didn't get when I bought mine; leather, very beautiful black interior, and a sunroof for cruisin main street to pick up chicks (if you live in Minneasota, ya know what I'm talking about).

The car comes with power locks, power windows, power mirrors, and more power accessories.You can control the window of your passenger on your side too.No more snotty friends keeping their window down when your freezing your butt off and they're hot as hell.

Another great thing about this car (yes, I know the list just keeps on going doesn't it?) is that there are fold down seats in the back so you can fit large objects in the trunk or set up some bumpin' box set full of subs to make the seats rumble to the sound of your favorite music.

Something great about my model I bought is that it came with installed turbos and dual exaust making this car unbeatable by any other V6 car.I am planning on buying a supercharger for this car too which will make it beat many V8's and make me stand out on the cruisin clique of main street.

The style of my car is great too.It came with a nice big ol' spoiler on the back and it also came with a phone and speaker system installed (weird, huh?) which actually works.

The car is an automatic (manuals are annoying!) which makes this a great car for younger drivers who don't want to keep all their attention focused on shifting instead of driving.The cars steering is tight and responsive as well.Buy this car if your interested, if I could do it over again I would get a Camaro or Thunderbird though.
