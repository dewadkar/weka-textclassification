            I've had a few digital cameras so far. This camera replaced a Kodak DC 210 which was stolen from my home during a move. I hope the mover who stole the camera is enjoying it as much as I did. I bought that particular camera primarily on price. It had much higher resolution than the Mavica FD7 which I was replacing, and it went really cheap on an online auction. When I bought my DC 280, a big factor was because I had enjoyed the DC 210 so much! I did all of the research, and the Kodaks had gotten great reviews. I did look at all the offerings at the time, but this camera was a lot nicer than my old DC 210 and it had the mega-pixel resolution that I craved.

   I have no remorse at all, nor do I have any desire to replace this camera. It has been extremely durable, I've put upwards of 2000 exposures through it already, i've spilled Coca Cola on it and it didn't rot away, it has been dropped and generally banged around..(not intentionally, mind you!) and it just keeps coming back with focused, clear high res. pictures which always seem to garner compliments. It is interesting to note that I tend to use not the highest resolution, but actually, the one right below it. (the number escapes my mind right now). I've made some wonderful 8x10's at that resolution, which rival the ones that my wife gets at the drug store from her negatives!

   I really like the glass  automatic focusing lens (vs. fixed focus), as well as the 2x optical, 3x software zoom, though I do miss the 10x zoom of my old mavica. I also like the choice of viewfinders, both preview screen as well as optical. That old screen was pretty tough to navigate on a sunny day! I also like the fact that although it's an automatic, it is possible to somewhat manipulate exposure
settings. The adjustable brightness/darkness setting for the preview screen is used a lot, as well.

   The only complaint that I have is a pretty universal one when it comes to digital cameras. Unless your favorite uncle owns a battery factory, you would be best suited to use only rechargeable types, as these things do like to munch on penlites! I also heartily recommend a card reader for downloading your photos, it's much more convenient than the cord from the camera, and significantly faster, too. All that in mind, I can honestly recommend this camera to anybody who wants a great reliable digital that doesn't mind spending the extra bucks. If the budget is tighter, the 215 seems to be a great buy.

UPDATE 3-17-01

  Just to let everyone know that I have surpassed 5000 exposures and this camera is still cookin' along, making great exposures. I still have no regrets.

  Interesting to note that:

  Kodak is now offering a firmware update, to version 1.01. I installed it and I know it sounds crazy, but I am now getting substantially more life out of my batteries. This is one of the general shortcomings which has been resolved.

  The DC 2800 is now "old news" They can now be had very reasonably. A great buy, if you ask Me.!
