            I remember when I was young I saw this vehicle on a poster at a store.  I told myself when it would come out it would be the greatest vehicle ever to exist.  Well, I was sort of correct.  I never really bought this car, but I own another Mazda car, the MX6.  From the looks of both of these cars, they are very similar, both interior and exterior.  Although the MX6 is much bigger, they show extreme similarities.  For one, their creator, Mazda, did a very good job on both.  I have notice that the Miata has a very aerodynamic look which grabs the attention of anyone!  Its sleek look and compact size proves that it can be used for those moments in which you wish you could be a teen again cruising down in the &quot;coolest&quot; car ever!  Mazda has a very good reliability rate.  Out of all their vehicles (Miata, MX6, 626, RX7, Protege, 323, 929, MX3, etc.) the Miata proves to be one of the most reliable.  I have heard of people going up to 200k miles before starting to see any problems!  Not lying, this is true.  I really recommend this car.
