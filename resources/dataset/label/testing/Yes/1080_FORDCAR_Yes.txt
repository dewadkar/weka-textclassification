             I traded up from a gutless Ford Aerostar to a 97 Windstar and have enjoyed traveling the city, highway and mountain roads ever since.  We bought the LX Windstar new with Quad seating (a must with teenagers) and a few other extras.  I have serviced it every 3- 4,000 miles and have had no mechanical problems with it for 68,000 miles and counting.  The vans 3.8L V6 has plenty of power which is appreciated when I try to pass a logging truck on a two lane mountain highway. By pulling out the rear seats I was able to haul furniture items that wouldn't fit into a friends full sized, capped pickup.  The family also appreciates the rear heat and air conditioning.  We like to travel and go camping and this van has met all of our needs.  The only compliant I have with it is that I am on my 3rd set of tires, due to their higher profiles mini-vans tend to scuff off the tire edges. If you are looking for a versatile and reliable mini-van you should consider the Windstar.  Even with the girls going off to college soon I plan to either keep this one or buy a new Windstar. <br><br>
