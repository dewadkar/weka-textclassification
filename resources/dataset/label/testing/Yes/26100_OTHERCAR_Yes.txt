            This is one awesome camera!  

I've had my Epson PhotoPC 750Z for about 6 months now, and I still enjoy it very much.  The first time I transferred some of the pictures to my PC, I was totally amazed!  The 1024x768 images that I saw were crisp, clear, and colorful.  I didn't even need to adjust them with a photo editor.  I've even printed some of my pictures on a color printer, and they came out as good as regular photos!  

The best thing is that I no longer have to buy film or pay someone to develop my film.  It's also very convenient to have the ability to delete pictures that you don't like...  I've taken up to 150 pictures with the camera's included 12MB of memory.  (some of the pictures were 640x480)  Even the lower-resolution pictures are awesome!  They're perfect for websites, greeting cards, and lots of other simple things.  

The battery life on this camera is also great.  Even using flash and the LCD, the batteries last for hundreds of shots.  Fortunately, the batteries are rechargeable NiMH batteries, so you don't have to pay extra for new batteries every week.  

This camera is excellent for everyone from casual users to professionals.  I will continue to use mine for a long, long time!<br><br>
