            The Ford Explorer is a workhorse and a playhouse.  The versatility of the Ford Explorer is not understood until one is owned and utilized.  The Explorer has true truck capabilities but not the bloated size of a truck or a full size SUV.  The optional four wheel drive capabilities are well worth the money add greater personal value especially when used in severe winter weather.  Recently, the southeastern US experienced snow and the town nearly totally shut down yet the Explorer rose to the occasion and had absolutely no problem handling the snow and ice on the steepest and sharpest mountain roads.  The Explorer can haul tools and equipment with great safety and makes trips to the grocery store painless.  The Explorer is my weekend getaway.  I can throw a canoe on the factory roof rack and a couple sleeping bags in the back and I have a hotel on wheels that can stop at any national park.  Mechanically the Ford Explorer is very sound.  My personal Explorer has over 150K miles and the transmission and engine are in great condition with no more maintenance than regular oil changes and personal tune ups.   <br><br>
