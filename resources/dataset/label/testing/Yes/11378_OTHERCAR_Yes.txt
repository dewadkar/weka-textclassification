                 The Grand Caravan is a nice looking piece of machinery and is priced right.   If your in the market for a lower-end minivan that can soccer mom you left and right, this is your minivan.   The dual air conditioning leaves much to be desired, however, the thought was nice.  The movable seats will come in handy when hauling larger loads  and perhaps the transmission you typically need between 50,000 and 60,000 miles on the MOPAR technology.  I enjoy driving my Grand Caravan around town and it looks nice, and appropriate when pulling up to the school in the morning when dropping off the kids.  I was momentarily romanced by the salesman when he spoke of the Grand Caravan's power and performance.  The performance was in his selling technique and not in the vehicles highway act.   Be reasonable, you get what you paid for and that is what the Grand Caravan is all about.  Its nice, its family orientated, it will not be featured in a James Bond film anytime soon.  The grocery getter that looks like the Brady Bunch of the 21st century.
