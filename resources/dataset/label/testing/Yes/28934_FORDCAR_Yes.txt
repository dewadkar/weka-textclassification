            This Ford Explorer is a really nice viciele.  I recently bought this suv and I love it.  I think that eveyone should get this suv if they are looking for a new suv.

Some of the new features with the 2000 model are-
-Trailer towing is now standard on 5.0-liter equipped XLT Sport,
-Eddie Bauer and Limited models. 
-Engine options include 4.0-liter 160-hp V6, 4.0-liter 210-hp V6 and 5.0-liter 215-hp V8. 
-New colors added this year are Chestnut Clearcoat and Black Clearcoat Metallic on Limited models. 
-The Eddie Bauer model comes equipped with lighted running boards, Mach Audio System and leather seating.
