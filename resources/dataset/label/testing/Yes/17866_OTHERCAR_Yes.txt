            My blazer is my best friend. Ever since my parents got it for my graduation (I have a 92) it has been faithfull ever since. Though it doesn't get the best mileage, i can trust it in the snow- which is great, since i live in blustery massachusetts. I don't know what I'd do without it! It's great to pile my friends in, for a short trip to the mall, or a summer day at the beach, i can fit tons of stuff (and people) in it! As long as I check my oil regularly (who wouldn't??) it runs like a dream..... My boyfriend loves to borrow it for camping trips- my car handles great on rough terrain. I think the blazer is THE car to have!<br><br>
