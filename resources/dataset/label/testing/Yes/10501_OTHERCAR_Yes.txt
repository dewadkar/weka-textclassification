            In looking for a near-luxury, high $20s-low$30,000s car, several very competitive models came to mind when we began our search.  The Audi A4, BMW 323, Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30, even the VW Passat.  As a car buff, I was aware of the much improved, redesigned-for-'99 Acura TL, but only when I seriously looked at it as an option for myself did I realize how amazing a value and in general how fine an automobile the TL is.  It basically offers a combination of more features, power, performance and room (not to mention reliability) than the others at a lower price.  Here's the deal: for about $28,500 you get practically every conceivable convenience and performance feature available, all standard.  This includes 225 horsepower (more than all but the Infiniti, which has 227), lots of torque, roadholding that betters just about all the others, traction control, ABS, 16&quot; alloys, 5-speed auto/manual shifter, front and front-side airbags and xenon headlights on the functional end.  For convenience, all the usual goodies (power everything, in-dash CD, moonroof, air filtration system, automatic climate control, leather, you name it, are included.  To be honest, the only thing that I wish it had is a driver's seat memory function.  My wife is smaller than I am, and a memory feature would have been handy.  To amaze and delight ourselves and our friends, we also got the fantastic navigation system for an extra two grand.  The thing is just incredible, providing actual directions by voice and display at each relevant point in your travel.  It's improved over the '99s in that the entire continental U.S. is covered on one DVD, rather than having region-specific discs as they did last year.  Beware, though - only more major metropolitan areas have complete street listings in full detail.  In LA where we live, it's terrific.  If we lived in parts of central California, for instance, the system would only provide major road and route info.  In the city though, it's pretty nifty.  Honestly, it even advises you to &quot;stay to the left&quot;, for instance, when approaching a fork in the road.  It's eerie, yet SO COOL !!!  Very easy to use, too.  

OK, enough with all the doo-dads.  They make the drive a lot of fun.  What's perhaps even more fun, though, is the way the TL drives.  It packs a nice, solid punch off the line (about 7.8 seconds 0-60, faster than all those mentioned above) and the engine and tranny are as smooth as butter.  As a bonus, the 2000 TLs are ULEV compliant, meaning they're exceptionally low-emissions vehicles.  The ride is soft without being too much so, damping bumps with an appropriately sporty firmness.  The steering is direct and provides good feel, and helps the fun factor on this car.  The fact that it has a &quot;manual&quot; shifting mode only enhances the experience.  It feels great to gun it and shift for yourself without a clutch, being able to put it back in automatic mode whenever you want.  While I slightly prefer the raspier engine note on the I30, the TL's responsiveness and feedback exceeds that of just about all the other cars I mentioned above, save for perhaps the BMW.  However, the TL offers substantially more backseat room and more power for several grand less, comparably equipped.  The trunk is voluminous, but the DVD player for the navigation system hangs down from the top of the trunk, impeding access slightly, and it would have been nice to have a full-size spare.

Stylistically, the TL is handsome but could have used a bit more inspiration.  It's best angle is the rear, with crisp lines and taillights, and sporty dual exhausts.  The front is least interesting; from longer distances, it's sometimes difficult to differentiate the TL from the current Honda Accord (on which the TL is based).  At night though, the bright bluish xenon lamps help distinguish the TL.  So overall, it's a clean design; it could have used a bit more panache in a few areas, but it's definitely a handsome, sharp car nonetheless.  Park a TL next to an A4, 323, or Passat and you'll see what I mean.  All other things considered though, the TL is a stand-out automotive value.

Which brings me to my last point: getting one.  Word of mouth has spread like wildfire on this car.  We wanted a specific color (White Diamond Pearl) that's in short supply, and this, combined with demand for the car in any color, caused a major acquisition headache.  There were apparently two - TWO - available the way we wanted it in the entire state.  Often times, waitlists have formed for certain color combinations, as people submit deposits to maintain a place in line.  The reason I mention this is that while the car is an excellent value, don't expect any deals over and above sticker.  You basically won't get it.  Luckily, dealers don't appear to be gouging, but what you see is what you get.  It makes the purchasing process easier, but if the TL's competitors are being sold for less than sticker, the TL's value quotient drops a bit and could potentially be a bit more expensive than a heavily discounted competitor.  Keep this in mind when making comparisons, but I still feel that the TL is simply the best overall car in a very capable field.  It's perfect for people who want luxury at a reasonable price, is roomy enough for 4-5 people, and makes an excellent executive express or upscale family car.  I'll end with this: I drive a Miata, but every chance I get, I try to sneak a drive in my wife's new TL.  Get 'em while they're hot.<br><br>
