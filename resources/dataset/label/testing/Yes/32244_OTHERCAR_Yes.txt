            <b> Introduction </b>

I actually purchased a 2004 model CLK320 coupe, but it's essentially the same as a 2003 model. I evaluated the BMW 330Ci as well, but as there's so many already in my area I wanted something different for the $40-50k I was going to spend. 

<b> Interior </b>

Via the dash computer you can set the steering wheel to move out of your way when you open the door, a nice feature. You can also select how long the interior lights and exterior lights stay on after exiting the vehicle. Additionally, you can check the engine oil level without having the open the hood! 

The back seat is I found to be more roomy than the competition. I sat in the back of a G35 coupe and there is just no way! (unless your 5 feet tall or below) To some it isn't important, but personally I do want to occasionally carry friends in the back so it is important to me. It feels more spacious than any other competitive coupe out there with the possible exception of the Acura CL. 

The dash display is impressive to me with everything easily visible. I love how the dash lights up white at night. I'd prefer that the center console also light up white or light blue instead of amber. 

Driver visibility is good. It certainly helps that the B-pillars are gone. 

Interior is pretty quiet, although surprisingly noisy when driving over concrete overpasses. (Worst experience was  from 880 N to 80 N in Oakland/Emeryville) Almost like there is no sound proofing at all. It does handle rough asphalt roads pretty well and quietly.

The parking brake pedal is too close to the side of the compartment. If you're not careful your shoe will rub against the upholstery. 

Controls are pretty intuitive although it takes some getting used to the turn signal. One quick touch (such as to signal a lane change) results in three turn flashes automatically and cannot be stopped. Nice idea, but if you make a mistake you don't have the opportunity to correct it. 

<b>Sound System </b>

The 8-speaker Bose sound system is wonderful, much better than the Harmon-Kardon of the Beemer for the music I listen to (jazz, R&B, Rock, Rap)

I feel cheated on the CD player. A single in-dash CD should be standard, but it's not even an option. I'm even more disappointed that the factory CD-changer cannot recognize CD-RW discs. I've rented a Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Altima within the last year and all could play the CD-RW I tried on the CLK.  Such a car supposedly on the leading edge of technology should be able to play a CD-RW disc. I do like how you can just key in the radio station instead of using dials. I wish you could store more than 10 station pre-sets on the FM band. 

<b> Exterior </b>

I love the way the windows roll down on the CLK if you press and hold the unlock button on the key fob. On the BMW the windows only open outward, not down. Despite what others may think, I like the new styling. I would not have purchased the previous CLK body as I thought it was really unattractive. I'm pleased that MB designed it with a different look than the E-class. 

The Xenon headlamps are wonderful! Although part of me wonders if the "auto-level" feature really exists in the car. 

<b> Handling </b>

Handling is good. During quick lane changes in LA traffic, I always felt in control of the car. It is very smooth at high speed. 


<b> Fuel Economy </b>

Fuel economy seems to be a bit better than rated. I was able to drive the roughly 350 miles from Vermont & 101 in Los Angeles to 880 & 237 in Milpitas (San Francisco Bay area) non-stop on a single tank of gas. That includes 90 minutes stuck on I-5 in the Angeles Mountains moving at 5mph in 104F degree heat with the AC set to 78F. (I'm actually surprised the car didn't overheat). The fuel warning light didn't even come on when I refueled in Milpitas. 

<b> Safety  </b>

At first I thought the seat belt presenters were a gimmick, but they are useful. Once the key is in the ignition, it automatically presents the seatbelt to you and the front passenger once the door is closed. It will also know to perform this task if you are picking someone up (again once the door is closed). 

Driver, front passenger airbags along with head and side airbags for all passengers are standard.

<b> Engine </b>

Looking at engine specs from competitive vehicles I was a bit disappointed in the comparison, but it moves quite nicely for my taste. I'm not a performance minded person and well if you're looking seriously at this car you shouldn't be either. 


<b> Trunk Volume </b>

Trunk Volume is pretty good. Although it quickly fills if you have one jumbo size suitcase. You'll only have room for a carry-on size roller bag after that. 

From golfer's perspective (my father is, I am not) I think it should hold two if not three golf bags easily. 

<b> Public Perception </b>

While this car is a head turner, I seem to notice 80% of the time its guys' heads who turn. Although according to my girlfriend, most women don't look at cars or even know what they are. I suspect the later. She only would look at one because I have one.

<b> Parting Thoughts </b>

All in all I'm still happy with the car, but if Mercedes wants to continue to justify the relatively high price of the car they need to do more. (In-dash CD player standard, two cup holders, better noise control over concrete roads) Not much more but still more... 
Not sure if Mercedes is paying these artists, but it did help my decision a little bit that many of the songs I like talk about the MB ... now I have one....
