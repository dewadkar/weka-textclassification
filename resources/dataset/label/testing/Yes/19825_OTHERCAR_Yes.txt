            My husband and myself purchased a 1997 40th Anniversary Land Cruiser.  We had always had the traditional family sedan and with my husband retired and always a lot of children/grandchildren around we started researching the SUV's.  

We drove every one of them except the Lexus.  The Lexus has the exact same engine/wheel base and honestly we did not want to pay the extra money just for the big &quot;L&quot; on the vehicle. We only observed the interior of the Lexus and again we were more impressed with the Land Cruiser.

 Every make/model we test drove felt like we were in a truck until we drove the Land Cruiser.  It still drives and handles like new.  We also have antique autos and tour all over the country. We pull the 30' LaSalle with no problems whatsoever.  This is not a V8 engine and we cannot believe how it handles the load and road. 

 There is not one thing I can say negative about this auto. As far as maintenance goes, we have only had to take the car in for the standard oil changes/filters,etc. No problems with anything mechanical.  We will definitely buy another one! <br><br>
