            Honestly, My Dad bought me this vehicle.  I wanted an SUV but was thinking about going along with the pack and getting an explorer.  I'm glad he chose otherwise.  My new car is a '00 Chevy Blazer 2DR with 4Wheel Autotrack.  I love the way the car drives, it handles great, I find the power to be more than adequate.  I have taken a few long trips in this vehicle and have had no problems with passing or large downgrade/upgrades.  To make these long trips more enjoyable I got the 6 speaker Bose sound system with CD and tape. The sound system is very nice, and was worth every penny.  While some people have said that the rear seat is small, my friends have found it to be adequate even on long trips.  Rear cargo space is somewhat lacking, but the car does come with a roof rack that can be utilized.  My only gripe about the 2Dr Chevy Blazer is the view out of the rear window.  With the spare tire and both rear seat headrest upright it is impossible to see out of the rear window.  This makes backing up impossible.  To rectify the situation I have left the rear headrests folder down.  I would recommend this car you young drivers who need 4 wheel drive.  I would not recommend this car to anyone who needs extensive carrying space, or a large amount of interior seating space.  I am definitely the coolest kid in school with this ride.<br><br>
