            We bought an S60 about six months ago, a new 2002, bought at an excellent price after the 2003 cars were out (unchanged).  In general we are very happy with the car, although there are some complaints and worries.  We wanted an all-wheel-drive car, and we were happy that we got one when the snow and ice hit.  The all wheel drive feature works flawlessly, and I was rarely aware of when power was being switched from one wheel to another.  It is a very advanced type of all wheel drive system, based on front wheel drive, and much better than those of some other companies.  In general the car has driven beautifully, and feels very comfortable and luxurious.  

It does NOT seem underpowered or to lack a good response when driven around sharp curves etc.  What is true is that the ride is not as precise and stiff as the BMW 3 series, but the BMW was rough, even bumpy.  I didn't mid that, but my wife certainly did.   All in all, I think the Volvo has a better ride, more comfortable handling etc., but this is a matter of personal preference.  Note: Even though the ride is softer than the BMW, this is not a mushy, American car.  It still seems very precise, just comfortable as well.

Controls:  The reviews all trash the radio because you have no buttons for the presets.  Instead you turn a knob.  (You can also move from preset to preset via a control on the steering wheel.)  this sounds like an irritating design because you can't go directly to the chosen station.  you have to turn the knob to the right number.  Is it really a problem?  Not for me, but it might be if you have six or seven preset stations that you really listen to.  be sure to try this out when you test drive the car.

Problems:  
The gas mileage is quite poor, maybe 17 mile a galoon in city driving, nothintg near that of our Accord.  By the way, we use "regular" (permitted), not "super" (recommended).

The electronic unit that controls the locking of the back doors, opening of the gas tank, trunk etc. suddenly died at about 3,000 miles.  Volvo fixed it, gave me a free loaner etc., but it was still very inconvenient.  it also made me doubt how reliable the car is and will be after the warranty runs out.  Would this happen on a Honda?  So far, the problem has not recurred.

Visibility is not so great out the back window.  I find the car a bit hard to parallel park, for instance.

My conclusion:  It is a great car.  I love it.  Consumers reports rates it as reliable.  If it is, I am sure I'll be very happy with it.  If not though, I am sure I will be miserable.
