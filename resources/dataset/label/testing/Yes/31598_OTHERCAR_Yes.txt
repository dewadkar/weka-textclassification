            I had the opportunity last year to buy about 100 digital cameras for resale.  They consisted of the following models: Nikon Coolpix 800 and 950, Olympus 2020z, Kodak DC280 and 290, and several SONY Mavicas.  I kept the 800 for personal use because it had the most inviting complement of features and an attractive price. 

It shares pic quality with the 950, but only has a 2x lens.  The design of the body is great, easy to hold, and you can throw it around a bit more than the other cameras with confidence that it won't break. 

The Olympus nearly won me over, but it seemed to bulky and too complicated for what I wanted to accomplish.  Pic quality was not that different fmom the 800 either.  Memory type is important here too as compact flash is a bit more robust than smart media.  The Nikon CP800 seems to get everything right, the weight, the feel, the quality and solid one piece design without any fancy lenses that go in and out every time you turn the camera on.

I avoided the Kodaks because I disliked the menu system which was difficult to use and read.  The SONY mavica is just not a higher end camera and it has way too many useless features.

hint: get NiMH batteries, AA Duracells die quickly.<br><br>
