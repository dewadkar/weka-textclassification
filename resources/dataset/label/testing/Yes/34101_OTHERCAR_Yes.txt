            I bought this car used about 6 months ago.   The car "looks wise" was in almost perfict condition.   And it only had 108,000 miles on it.  Some of you might think this is alot of miles, but I had a 1986 Crown Victoria that went well over 318,000.    

Anyhow, heres the story.   The very next day the engine blew a rod after driving up a hill at about 55mph.    I ended up calling AAA and having to have the car towed back to the carlot where I bought it.   Fortantly the dealership replaced the engine for free.   So I was on my way again.  

One month later, the transmission started leaking.   Seemed like a simple fix.   It was the torq converter seal.    After 2 weeks of working on the car in what little spare time I had, I ended up finding out the torq converter barrings went out and runed the torq converter shaft.  All together I had about 500 bucks in fixing it, and two weeks of my time.   To get to the transmission, the engine had to be removed.   I really didn't want to do this myself, but I couldn't find a mechanic willing to touch it for under $2000.00.  

Shortly after that, the heater / cooler fan went on the fritz.   It now has two working positions, hotter than he11, or colder than ummm.... he11.    

A month ago, wind blew a tree on top of it and totally crushed the car from the back window back.  Deffently not the cars fault, but the parts to replace it was extremely expensive.    Just for the back window, it cost $800.00.  Almost 2,500.00 in damage.  Fortantly the insurance covered all of it except $100.00.

I put back breaks on it a few weeks ago, cost almost double than my Crown Victoria did.   About 35 bucks for the back breaks.     And the calipers were froze up and rusted, they really need to be replaced.   I also knoticed the back swaybar is broken.

The speedomiter cable fell off last week, wich caused the dash to read "0" (its digital).   Not a big problim, but this cable also controls the downshifting of the transmission.  Should be easy to fix, but unfortantly, the exhaulst has to be removed before the plug can be reached.

Ok, enough of the " cons ".    The car actually looks GREAT!  Their simply is NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING that rides like a lincoln.   The only thing "close" would be a Cadalac.  

On the average, I am getting about 21mpg. I don't beleive this is too bad considering the size of the car.   The trunk is EXTREMELY roomy.   I took it on a 6 hour trip when I first bought it with four grown adults in it, we were more than confortable.    

There are no cup holders, but a cup caddy from walmat fits nicely on the floor in the front under the dash.   

<b>Some features I have fallen in love with</b>
- Air Ride supension, smooth ride.
- Climent control (if its working)

- Auto Dim on the Bright Lights, turns the bright lights off when a car is comeing at you, and back on when it leaves.
- Heated Mirrors
- Auto Door locks (locks all doors when you put it in drive)
- Auto Head lights
- Anti Theft Gas Lid (Can only be opened with button inside glove box)
- Built on Security Alarm (extremely sensitive)
- Trunk release inside the glove box.
- Anti Slam Trunk (you can barley close the trunk lid, and it will electronicly lower iself into a secure closed position)

I really enjoy the lincoln.   It looks great, rides great, and I really didn't pay a whole lot for it, about $2,800.  Despite all the problims I have had with it, I would probibly still buy it again.    I assume the previous owner was rough on the car.   And I am sure after all the bugs are worked out, the car will have plenty of life in it.  The 3.8 liter engine is a solid built engine that with some care and knowhow, it will run forever.   The Ford Torus is the same engine.

If your looking for a car that screams class this is the car.  But be carefull when buying a used one.   Use common sence, and make sure the car is as good as it looks.  Maybe see if the dealer will let you bring it home for a night.   
Ask the dealer if he knows the owners, or any history of the car.  Sometimes dealers will let you call the owners. 

My brother had the same car, same year, and he never had any trouble with it.   I really feel the previous person abused the car.   So be carefull when buying a used car.
