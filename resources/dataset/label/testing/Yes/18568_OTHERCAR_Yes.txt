            I had narrowed my choices down to the Nikon Coolpix 990 and the Casio QV-8000. While the 990 certainly lives up to the Nikon name, the Casio has enough composition control features to enable me to create great shots. 
I spent a good deal of time looking for this camera in a local store to no avail. Finally purchased from BUY.COM. Some of the features I use most: Exposure +/- for backlit subjects, continuous shutter mode that captures 5 shots and you pick the best one and delete the rest. Panorama, fun! AVI movie mode, more fun; no sound though... The macro works very well.
The 8X zoom and high shutter speed has allowed me to catch hummingbirds at our feeder full frame from 8 feet away.
One feature that routinely gets mentioned in reviews is the lack of an optical viewfinder. My opinion is that, with the 8X zoom, it would be useless . 
Of course, the viewfinder is difficult to see in bright outdoor lighting; but, you can work around it.
* Quality of the camera and accessories is superb.
* Battery life is 2+ hours of continuous shooting.
* Invest in at least a 32MB Compact Flash card.
* Viewing images is easy due to the camera saving the images in an HTML format; however, Internet Explorer 5 seems to not be able to display 4 color JPEG files.
