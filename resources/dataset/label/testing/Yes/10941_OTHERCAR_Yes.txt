            This being my first contribution to e-pinions, I don't want it to be somethign negative; the most positive comments I have to make is about my car, a 2000 BMW 323 iTouring. 
I'm female, mid-fifties, and have driven domestic and import cars for the last 30 years, never a BMW, although I grew up in Germany. BMW's, in Germany, are like "you have arrived", and I didn't know that I had!
I'm still not sure that I have arrived, but my teenage son, who is a BMW afficionado, talked me into buying one almost three yeard ago.
I'm glad.
Nearly three years old,, with about 50,000 miles on her, "Missy" still drives and feels like a brand new car. No rattles anywhere, no groans, no moans. (Say this of any domestic, they tend to rattle from day1). You push the accelerator, and she seems to say:" How fast, and how soon?" You push the brakes and stop on a dime. You get to a tight curve, and she sticks to the road, no squealing.  I am not an automotive expert. I know that my BMW is a 2.5l I6, and really it has no right to get to 160 mph. ( Where in the U.S. can you do that, anyway?)
What I do know though, is that I feel totally confident, that when I drive "Missy", that I can accelerate as fast as I want to, stop as fast as I need to, and I can hug tight curves even when I don't expect them. 
This car, like any BMW, is a sports car in disguise, and never mind the cargo capacity. You can enjoy a sports car performance, even while you're lugging a dozen 2x4's, and a load of fertilizer. (Just don't look back!) And meanwhile, enjoy 12 speakers on your stereo system. Which brings me to another subject.
EURO_DELIVERY!. YES! It seems I wound up with extra speakers and a few more extras (like a 3.25 liter displacement instead of a 3.23), when I went with EURO delivery. Plus I saved a good $ 4,000.00 on my purchase price when I took delivery  of it in Munich. (You can use the savings to finance a vacation in Europe, or just be happy the car was cheaper). 
A word of warning, though! For the first 5,000 miles or so, in order to run your new BMW in properly, you can't exceed 3,000 RPM. Which means you can't even get close to Autobahnspeeds. So allot the time to at least run the car in properly, before you have to have it shipped. And don't loose the chance to try it out on mountain serpentines and straight-out Autobahn at 200 kph.I'm still disconsolate. I didn't have time to run Missy in properly before I had to hand her over to be shipped, which is part of EURO-delivery at no extra charge. Here in the States, I will never be allowed to drive fast enough to see what she can really do! Oh well, it's one of those missed opportunities! In conclusion, under the hood, exterior, interior, this, in my 30 years of driving experience, is the most fun-to-drive, useful, and reliable car I have ever owned. I intend to keep her for another ten years at least. She's good for it.
