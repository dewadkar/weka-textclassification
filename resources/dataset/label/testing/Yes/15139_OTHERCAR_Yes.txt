            It's been a long day.  Screaming kids, nagging girlfriend, worked too much.  The night doesn't promise any relief.  You've got to get away.  At that moment, while climbing the stairs from the basement with a cold Brisk iced tea, your keys stab you in the thigh...a sign?  Who cares.  Fire up the GT and roll on out to a country road.  You've got some driving to do!

Okay, in all reality, this car has bite.  I'm speaking of my '96 Cherry red GT Grand Am.  the engine is a high-revving automatic v-6, 3L and a spoiler sits atop the back end, hence the GT.  I bought the vehicle used, the first car of my own, at 19 yrs old.

Although the car jumps well from stop signs, the best acceleration range is at highway passing speed.  I love to just open up the engine!  Keep an eye on your RPM's though; the car has the ability to outdo its own capacity.  It handles just okay, though.  I'm comparing to a Dodge Intrepid sport, which has a wider wheel base.  Remember the &quot;wider is better&quot; advertising from pontiac?  a couple years too late for this one.

One thing I'm still impressed with about the car is the factory sound.  People often ask me if I have 12's (12 inch subwoofer speakers) in the trunk.  I dont.  The only thing I added was an in-dash CD player.  The audio was there to start with.  The highs are crisp and clear, the lows are strong, but not overwhelming, unless you boost them up and crank the volume.  Sounds like the concert hall of factory speakers.

I love the four-door with plenty of spacious comfort, both in front and back.  Nice car to tote a family around in, and, when alone, still look like you don't yet have one.  The car is now 6 model yrs old, and it's in great shape.  I've replaced the alternator, had a couple minor fluid leaks plugged.  Pontiac has also outgrown the head gasket nightmares of its previous models, as well, so no worries there.

The worst and most annoying thing about it is that twist in your stomach that you get when you turn on the a/c and nothing happens.  air comes out, but its WARM!  but, you get that with many post-toddler age cars.

Overall, if you're wanting to retain or regain a little youth without blowing your viagra savings, or wanting an American car that looks great, feels great, and still has room for the little ones, give the Grand Am a spin around the block.<br><br>
