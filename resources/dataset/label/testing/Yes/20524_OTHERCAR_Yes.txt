            I bought a used 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva in 1997.  I was a little apprehensive about the purchase because my family always owned nothing but Fords.  I'm here to say that five years, one accident, and 70,000 miles later that the Oldsmobile Achieva is a great car.

This car is great for commuters.  I drove this car to and from school (appx 35 miles to school then 35 miles back) five days a week for four years.  In all that time, other than regular maintainance, I only had a radiator leak and a dead battery.  I never worried about breaking down on the side of the parkway.  One of the best thinks about this car is that the panel that has the radio, AC, and heater controls if facing the driver so it's really easy to make adjustments  without taking your eyes off the road.  The seat is also really comfortable.  It almost hugs you.  The steering wheel is also really thick so your hands don't get tired when you've been driving for a long time.

I've also got to mention that I had a relatively bad accident in this car and my passenger and I were able to walk away without almost no injuries.  The passenger wasn't hurt at all and I only had a small bruise on my knee.

Because it is 2002 going on 2003, the 1995 Achieva probably isn't the car for a serious commuter.  However, if I were you I'd definitely check out a newer model.
