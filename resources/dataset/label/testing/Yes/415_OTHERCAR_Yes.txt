            The ES300 has been evolving for some eight years now adding to its tremendous list of luxurious ammenities as well as its powerful engine.  As Lexus commercials have often tried to demonstrate, the ES300 is very quiet as well as smooth.  Additionally, once you begin driving one, it is very hard to move on to another car, except if it is within the Lexus line.  I have had the pleasure of driving one for six years (two different ES300s) and can not complain.

In terms of driving performance, there is nothing I can say to complain about the driving and handling of the car... The only issue is keeping the car under the speed limit.  The handling is marvelous.  Even a small twist of the steering wheel yields a large turn from the car.  The wheel turns with ease and makes driving so nice.

The safety features are numerous...  The standard dual air bags as well as a roll cage design always makes driving less stressful.  Furthermore, with multiple crumple zones, side, rear, and front collisions dampen the impact and will cause less injuries.  Personally, I have not had the need to see these safety features in my six years, but I can assure you that they work.  My friend had a head on collision two years ago with an ES300 and only had a slight injury to her tongue because she bit it during impact.  She was fine otherwise.

The leather seats and premium sound system make you feel as though youre on a leather couch in the middle of an entertainment unit say in your home.  It is such a comforting feel as you drive to enjoy the ambiance.  The ES300 truly makes driving fun and gives you the power to maneuver how you please.<br><br>
