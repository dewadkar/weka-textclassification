                 Fall means different things to different people.  To me, ever since I was a youngster, Fall has meant that it was time for the release of next year's new model cars.  This year, as in the past, I have always anxiously anticipated getting to see, and especially getting to drive, the latest new Honda's.

     Upon entering the showroom, my eyes were immediately drawn to the 2001 Honda Passport 4WD EX with the Luxury Package.  What a beauty!  I was impressed by this vehicle's overall appearance, from it's rugged looks, to it's sleek aerodynamic styling.  The two-tone paint and body side-moldings were extremely effective in their presentation.  This sport utility vehicle looks tough enough to take you just about anywhere you want to go, but just one look inside, and you know that you are going to have one comfortable smooth ride getting there.

     The Passport 4WD EX comes with an automatic 4 speed transmission with a shift-on-the-fly 4WD, 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS, a power moon roof, and many other great features.  The Luxury Package gets you leather trimmed seats and door panels, a 4 way adjustable power driver's seat, as well as my favorite part of the deal, which is a spectacular sounding AM/FM stereo cassette with a 6 disc in dash CD changer.  Sophisticated audiophiles will appreciate the smooth, powerful bass response, and the natural sounding crystal clear highs.

     No discussion of an automobile is complete without mention of what's under the hood.  I was immediately impressed by the visual presentation that my eyes were greeted with.  The engine was a 3.2 liter 205 horsepower V-6 that looked like it was all business, and that it had plenty of power to spare.  The positioning of the various components under the hood was well designed and easily accessible, affording the opportunity for the amateur car enthusiast to be able to perform the usual routine maintenance chores without having to be a contortionist.

     It was now time to inspect and test out the interior more closely.  The seats were extremely comfortable, both in the front and back.  There was ample leg and head room for even the biggest of passengers.  The controls of the audio system, climate control system, and the like, felt like they were just where they should be.  The interior's ergonomic design was accentuated by a number of useful amenities such as cupholders, interior lights, cruise control, and power windows and door locks.  All were placed within easy reach, and felt comfortable and easy to use.

     I was now ready for the ultimate test, the test drive.  This vehicle has plenty of pep.  I was able to enter onto the highway and quickly achieve highway speeds without any difficulty.  The transmission was smooth and seamless during gear changes.  It took to steep hills and sharp turns quite well, and the breaking was quick, clean, and straight.  Unfortunately, I was not able to test out how the Passport handled off road driving conditions, but I can say that the 8 inches of ground clearance and gas powered shock absorbers seemed like they should make off road driving quite smooth and controlled.

     If I had to state any negatives about the Passport, it would be the same drawback that I find on most, if not all Honda vehicles that I have driven, including my own 1998 Accord EX, and that is that the ride is a bit noisy.  One can readily hear road noises, and this is especially true for passengers who might be riding in the back.  I love my music.  The stereo system sounds incredible when the vehicle is stopped, but a big drawback for me was that at highway speeds, the sound of the music was meaningfully compromised by intrusive road noises.  Come on Honda. Spend a little more time and effort in sound proofing and insulating your vehicles.  It will improve sales, and increase customer satisfaction, especially for this customer.
