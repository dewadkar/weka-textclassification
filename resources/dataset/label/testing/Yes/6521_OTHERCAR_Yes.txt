            I purchased my Sunbird SE 3.1L-v6 in 1996 when it had 30k miles on it. It now has 140k miles on it and it's been an awesome car. It's fully loaded - power windows, ABS, power locks, auto-trans, AC, alloy wheels, cruise control, rear window defrost, and tilt steering wheel. I think the only things it doesn't have are a sunroof and a CD player.

The V6 gives me awesome acceleration from stoplights and for passing vehicles on the interstate at 70+mph. The car also has a very smooth ride and awesome handling.

The factory installed stereo still sounds awesome (although I think I finally blew a speaker a couple of weeks ago). 

I've had the alternator replaced twice and the starter once and the thermostat once. I don't see the point of mentioning standard maintenance items like the serpentine belt or brakes. 

My only gripe about the car is that the older it gets, the worse the fuel economy gets. I used to be able to get 350-400 miles on a tank of gas, now I get 275-325 on a tank.

Overall, this little car has been very good to me. So good to me that when I went looking for another car a couple of years ago, I ended up keeping my Sunbird because nothing else performed as well. 

The name of the game, boys and girls, is maintenance. Keep up with your oil changes and transmission fluid changes and the other basic maintenance and chances are high your vehicle will do well.
