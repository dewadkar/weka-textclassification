            My Canon G1 had the dreaded, well published, black screen of death. Or in other words, it completely died with the lens extended. Off to buy a new camera. 

I have used cameras for over 20 years now, and I currently own a Canon Elan II with a Tamron 28-200,  440EX flash, and vertical grip. Other cameras I've owned: Minolta X-700, Yashica Rangefinder, Koni-Omega Rapid 6x7 Rangefinder.

The Canon G1 was my digital entry allowing me to use the same flash. Now that it has passed on, I've replaced it with a Canon G3. 

I'm not the one to list all the features of a product. You can look at other reviews and get that information. I'll just cover what I like and dislike about this camera.

<b>PROS</b>

<b>Flip Screen</b>- This is probably the most useful feature that not many other cameras have. The LCD screen flips out and turns around in several contortions. It allows you to hold the camera directly above your head and still get the shot. That's because you can flip the LCD screen straight down, hold the camera above your head (to shoot above other people's heads), and still frame and focus your shot. You can also flip the screen so that it faces the subject. That allows you to stand in front of the lens, (group photo with you included) and frame the shot. This is really cool when you use the <b>wireless remote</b> with it.

<b>Image Quality</b>- Even though it is only 4MP, quality enlargements can be made to 11x14. Actually, people have told me that my G1 3.3MP enlarged at 8x10 looks better than film. And they can't tell the difference. I can. The 3.3 looks fine at 8x10 and the 4MP looks fine at 11x14. With prints at those sizes, you won't be holding them up to your nose anyway. 

<b>Modes</b>- There are too many to mention. Some of the really cool ones are being able to expose the flash differently than the background, being able to save custom settings, and (the mode I use most) Portrait.

<b>Flash hot shoe</b>- People just don't realize how important this can be. When you finally realize that 10 feet just doesn't cut it, how do you use an external flash with other cameras? This camera allows you to connect a Canon EX series flash to the camera and increase your range and coverage. 

<b>CONS</b>
A little bulky- Really, that's all I can complain about.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I love this camera. Since I purchased the G3 (and the G1), I've rarely shot film. I like being able to review which photos I want to print, without having to drop off film, and pick up a whole bunch of photos. I can print just the best ones all while retouching them myself on my computer. Much easier than trying to describe to the photo lab person what to do.
