            The Chevrolet Blazer, is a great vehicle. The 4.3 litre engine is a top of the line V6, it has great power and can pull it's weight without being a gas guzzler. The sporty look of this vehicle makes this a great vehicle for a person of any age. It is great for a family, yet also good for a group of party animals to pile into after a party. The 4 wheel drive  is amazing on this vehicle. The option of being able to switch from 2 to 4 wheel and back again at any speed is a beautiful, and helppful feature. When fully loaded, this SUV feels like a caddie! Although almost like every other SUV on the market, the handeling on sharp turns can be better. If your looking for sports car handeling, get a sports car. Over all, a great machine in every aspect.
