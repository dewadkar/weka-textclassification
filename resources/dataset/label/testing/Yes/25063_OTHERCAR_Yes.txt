            Best from Kodak. Comparable with Nikon CP 990 and Olympus 3030Z. Very appealing pictures, well balanced, saturated colors, etc. Very easy to use. Uses CF Cards, has USB connection, 3X optical zoom, and flash connection plug for any flash unit. Chech www.digicam.tc for details, and sample pictures, as well as a comparison with Nikon CP 950.

It is very easy to use because it is much more similar to our old 35 mm cameras, especially if you want to shoot at manual mode. You don't even have to read the manual. Over and under exposure knob is the first thing that you will notice, which is the adjustment that you will need the most. You don't have to enter the menus for that. For aparture priority, all you have to do is to select the aparture from the main knob, again w/o going into the menu.

As soon as the Kodak DC 4800 arrived, I started to experiment to see the capabilities of this camera, and naturally compared it with my previous camera, a Nikon CP 950, to see the better sides of each one. This is all in our site, www.digicam.tc

As expected, both have a lot of good or weak areas, but before you start, you may read Steve's review about the Nikon DC 4800, and go over Kodak's specification sheets, to understand this new camera better.

After all, I'm sure that you will like the camera.
