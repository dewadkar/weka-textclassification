            When my brother turned sixteen he looked into buying a used Saab as his first car. We got a really great deal on a Saab 900 with low mileage. I don't know how my brother ever talked Mike into buying this car. I have to say that I enjoy every ride I take in it with him to and from school. There is a very powerful engine that allows you to get great acceleration out of the five speed transmission. Since it is low to the ground, it takes turns without a problem and is almost everything you could want in a luxury car. This car heats up fast in the winter and you won't stay cold for long in this car. A large trunk made it possible for us to put a system in the back of the car without a problem and still have room for our bags. The trunk also makes it possible to fit ski's of snowboards into the car for those who like to hit the slopes.

However there was a downside to owning a Saab. The first reason is that it is a foreign car so it is expensive to repair. Also since it is low to the ground, my brother has taken out the oil pan on the car a few times. Since we live in Connecticut when the temperature drops, the car tends to make weird sounds but none that make you feel as if the car will fall apart. Once the car heats up everything is fine. 

I think that the Saab 900 is a great car if taken good care of. Its handling and acceleration rank up there with the best of cars. The Saab 900 makes driving fun and will make long drives seem short.<br><br>
