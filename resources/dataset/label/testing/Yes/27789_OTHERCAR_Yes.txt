            Alright, this camera is a little expensive, ranging from 300 bucks to about 500, but in the end it is definatly worth it.  Its not the top of the line digital Canon Elph, there is one that takes miniature movies (30 seconds)which is pretty niche.
  
Advantages--  The S100 is the midget of digital cameras, its tiny and still has an awesome view screen on the back.  It will fit in a coat or pant pocket, and it comes with a great carrying case.
- The pictures are of great quality
- The Menu on the LCD screen is very satisfactory, it's easy to view and access many different pictures that you've taken
-Another cool feature is the black and white feature, allowing the camera to take b and w digital shots
-Memory Card holds tons of pictures, and if the pictures stink, you can always delete them!

Disadvantages--  The S100's zoom lens is pretty stubby, it zooms in clearly, but a couple more inches wouldn't hurt (like a midget
- Memory cards can be expensive

All in all this camera is an awesome buy,if your looking for a great camera to take real good pictures and be realy worth the money, buy this Canon, or the next step up.  If your spending the money on a digi, you might as well spend about 300-400 bucks on a good, reliable one, like the S100, instead of getting ripped off by a cheap one. Definatly buy this camera!
