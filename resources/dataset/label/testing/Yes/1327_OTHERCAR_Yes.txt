            I have put about 53,000 miles on my 99 Silverado LS 4x4 and have had no major problems.

The only immediate annoyances when I bought were the flimsy cup holder (for non console models).  you can't put anything in it without it rattling around and spraying liquid everywhere, so make sure you use a cup with a lid.  Also some squeaks and rattles of dash components are starting to get worse.  The other thing I don't like are the automatic headlights (fully automatic, not daytime running lights).  I have NO control of the lights when its dark, so when sitting a parking light with the engine on, my lights are on. If I want to flash my lights on and off, I can't (although there is high and low beam).  Ford and Jeep have overrides for this, but not Chevy.  Also, the doors lock when you take off, but don't unlock when you stop and turn the key off (must be the adult proof lock option).

The 5.3l engine has plenty of power and gets decent mileage for a full size truck.  It rides pretty well, even better than some decent mid size cars that I have driven.  Seats are comfortable and the new longer cab is roomy.  I have slept in the back seat on long trips and its not bad for a truck.  The autotrack 4x4 option is so-so, the response time could be better (but that may be the traction control engineer in me).
