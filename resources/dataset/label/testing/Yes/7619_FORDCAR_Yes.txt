            I love sport cars, and when my husband pulled into our driveway in the 1994 turquoise Mustang convertible, I dripped dishwater all the way across the dining room carpet and out the garage door, getting to the driver's door. I warned him, &quot;You'd better be serious about this.&quot;

He was, and I was soon in the driver's seat of a sleek, topless beauty.  I'd wanted a convertible since I turned 16, but this was my first at 45.  The flowing lines of the '94 make it a favorite body style of mine; I won't trade it for a new one.  

I love the envious, resentful looks of teenagers once they realize I'm a middle-aged broad in a cool convertible their parents won't buy them, and they can't afford insurance for.  I do wish I'd gotten a 5-speed manual, but the automatic shifts at the right places and has been trouble-free.  And even though Ford designed this convertible not to flex, it certainly does flex side-to-side when easing over speed bumps.  

Driving my dream car has been a delight for five years.  No repairs have been necessary, just regular maintenance.  A highlight of any weekday is putting the top down and slaloming through one of the canyons over to the coast for a cruise in the sea breeze.  Anyone who likes being outdoors and driving a classy piece of machinery would enjoy owning a '94 Mustang convertible.<br><br>
