            Due to the misfortune of having my car totaled in an accident I found myself in the market for a new car. I took a mechanic friend of mine with me on a whirlwind tour of local car lots trying to find a car that called my name. 

Upon entering one such car lot I found a few cars that I was interested in and began to check them out. After about an hour I still hadn't found anything that really &quot;rang my bell&quot; until I noticed this little Mustang LX. 

On the outside it didn't look like much. It needed a new paint job and its tint was in sad shape but I checked it out anyway. Apparently, its previous owner had not paid much attention to the exterior of the car but the interior was immaculent!

We opened the hood and found it to be in very good condition. I took it for a test drive and fell in love with it!

This Mustang is only a 2.3 liter 4 cylinder so I didn't expect it to have too much power. I was mistaken. Even being 11 years old its get up and go had not yet got up and left. Its 5 speed transmission made it a blast to drive.

What impressed me most was that even after all this time, all the electrical systems still worked like a charm. It is equipped with power windows, door locks, power steering and even power mirrors which are adjusted from a small panel next to the driver's seat. It also came with cruise control and anti-lock brakes which also still work like a charm. It has a great stereo system that out performs many of the systems in newer cars I have driven. 

I'm glad I found my little Pony. With proper maintainence and a little TLC I expect it to be with me for a long time. As with any older vehicle you have to expect little things to need work but this car has suprised me with very little mechanical problems. Soon it will get a new paint job and a new tint and it will look all spiffy again like it was meant to look.

I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a dependable, used car that is well built. Unfortunately with Mustangs you need to thoroughly have them checked out even more so than with some other cars before purchase because of the way some people will drive them to death. Good luck in your search.
