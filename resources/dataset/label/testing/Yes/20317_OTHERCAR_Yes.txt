            SUV's are so versatile when it comes to &quot;configuring cargo&quot; be it human or &quot;stuff&quot;--- so Ford Explorer had served our needs for several years.  Time to trade in and trade up, so we tried the '99 Mercury Mountaineer . What a ride!  Six-way seats with lumbar; the wonderful suspension and all the time 4 wheel drive lets us sail thru all kinds of road conditions in confidence and comfort not experienced in any other vehicle!  (Refuses to hydroplane even here in wet Oregon)  Cockpit is so well designed and controls so intuitive that we felt at home behind the wheel immediately--besides cruise,there are controls for heat, sound, fan, --conveniently duplicated on the steering wheel---not just luxury but a safety feature.  Digital readout of mpg., fluid levels, oil, etc, are a nice feature.  Monogrammed leather interior is gorgeous.  What do I NOT like?  V-8 engine is a little greedy. So far mpg is 16.4 (according to the digital readout in the cockpit which is right on with our old-fashioned check it out mode) Our other vehicle is diesel powered and gets 24-30 mpg. But we just came home from a meeting in pea-soup fog....the foglights and lighting system is phenomenal! Lots of nifty little stuff, like compass and temperature readout...handy when there's ice.  What a car!  We love it! Who shouldn't buy it?  Those looking for great economy should stay away.  Get a used VW rabbit or a small Honda?  
PS!  Update!  Feb.19th, 2000 - Car now getting 18.6 mpg av.!  Still seems to be on the increase!
