            Wow! what a great car for the money.   I bought a 1996 Saturn SL2 model.  I got the base model which has power nothing, but an auto trans.  The car is a hunter green, which gives it a sporty look.  The one thing about the engine that is so good is performence mode.  It shifts at a lower RPM for quicker Acceleration.  
  I could basically live in these seats.  The back unfortunatly is not that big with he seats pushed all the way back.  Plenty of room for kids.  The trunk is enormous.  I could fit like 4 sets of clubs in it.
 Another impresive thing is milage this thing can go up to about 200,000 miles +.  
I would definately recommend this car,but try to get more options, it would make the car so much easier to use.
