            Since I have five children, I always drove a van.  When three of them grew up and moved out of the house, I was able to buy a smaller vehicle.  I wanted to buy something that was reliable, low gas mileage, safe, and had a comfortable back seat.  I test drove about everything on the market.  I always sat in the back seat of a car before I even bothered to take the vehicle for a drive.  It had to be comfortable for my two growing boys.

I read Consumer Reports and they rated the Honda Accords the best.  So off I went to the Honda dealer.  I have to admit that I was very impressed.  I am still as impressed today as I was then.

My Accord looks very sporty, gets great gas mileage, is comfortable, and is very reliable.  Since I am a single mom, reliable is very important to me! The color of mine is sage green, which looks almost blue.  I love the color and the looks.  Unfortunately, my teenage sons also love it.  We have put 120,000 miles on it so far!  I haven't had anything major done for repairs.  

I don't have any complaints at all about my car.  In fact, my 19 year old recently joined the army.  He is buying a new Honda Accord for his first vehicle.  When I wear this one out, I plan on buying another Accord. 

I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't love them, unless they want a roomier vehicle.
