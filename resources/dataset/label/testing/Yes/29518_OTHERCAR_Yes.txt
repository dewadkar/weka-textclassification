            My boyfriend bought this camera last year, and it is the best I have used yet.  The picture quality is great...clear and not choppy like a lot of other cameras.  It also loads the pictures fast, so you don't have to worry about moving the camera around after the picture has been taken.

Installing this camera is so easy, that anyone can do it.  It uses a USB connection, which saves a lot of time.  Included is a cd with everything you need including drivers and help files.

Not only does the camera take great pictures, it has a lot of wonderful added features such as borders (great for wedding, baby, birthday pictures), flash, zoom, and a timer (great for taking pictures of yourself).

The only weakness the camera has is the life of the batteries, which is not all too important since it comes with a charger and rechargable batteries.
