            My <b>Honda Prelude</b>�. 
I do not know much about cars and am hesitant to write in this category, but I will give a layman�s perspective on my car, because it is my car and I have an opinion on it. So here goes nothing�

I leased a <b>1999 Honda Prelude SH</b>, color <i>silver metallic blue</i>, the same color shown in the picture here on this page! The <b>exterior</b> color is unique (somewhat of a periwinkle hue), but definitely a girly color� my boyfriend used to own a dark forest green Prelude. They do have a small, but interesting array of colors.  All �pearlized�, they currently come in  white, black, silver, and blue. And a  �Milano Red�, all with a charcoal black interior. The exterior body styling (I have the SH, which is the sportier model: comes standard in five speed with a rear spoiler), is very sleek and slender. It looks great driving by and has very stylish stock rims. 


I have the cloth black <b>interior</b> which is very nice looking. The feel of the dashboard and the doors, I must admit, feels a little less than luxurious, though. The layout of the dashboard features is very simple and everything is easily accessible. The stock radio system (w/CD Player) sounds very nice. Includes a tilt moon roof, a luxurious feature, and of course the standard cruise control, trunk release, a nice console with well placed cup and change holders, well powered AC, power windows, etc. <b>Safety features</b> include ABS breaks and dual airbags. 

The front seats are fairly comfortable, although on long rides, or if you are tall, it will not be comfortable for you. They are very low and you feel like you are not sitting up straight. The back seat is not really very functional, maybe for small children or a small build short adult. There are no ashtrays or a cigarette lighter built into my car, but there is a socket to charge a cell phone.  The trunk is roomy for a car of this size, and the back seat folds down for extra space or oblong objects, like say, a fishing pole?

The only <b>specs</b> I know, or so my boyfriend has told me are that it has 200 Horsepower and gets 22/27 city/hwy MPG. It has a 4 cylinder V-tec engine.  I feel it is good on gas, and several times when the �get gas now� light came on, we (my boyfriend), kept driving and driving and driving for over ten miles and it still did not run out of gas. It does, however suggest taking only premium gas, which these days, gets quite expensive. Now the best part, <b>driving it</b>� the drive is very smooth, and the shifting is also very smooth. I don�t have the 0-60 stats (at least I�m honest), but the pickup is great and it is very smooth going very fast! Honda, (or at least my car), is also a very reliable car. The I have had this car for over two years, still young, yes, but the only thing that I have had a problem with is one blinker light went out, that's it!

The handling of this car is my favorite part. Never having a new sports car before this one, I was amazed at how well this car handles (not as great in snow), and how it turns corners and brakes so accurately. I think the corner handling is due to torque or something, like I said I am no expert in this area. :)

Well overall, I am very happy with this car, and would like to lease another one if possible. The color, interior features and handling are my favorite features. I hope this is helpful as a layman�s view opinion in an intimidating (auto) category to be writing in. Thanks for reading, I welcome comments on anything I may have missed. 

Happy and safe driving,

~Stephanie
