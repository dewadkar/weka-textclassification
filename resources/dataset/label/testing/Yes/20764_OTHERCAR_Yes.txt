            I bought my 1990 Honda CRX in December of '99 as my first car.  I had never heard of the car before, but it looked and drove great, and what research I did (on cars.com) seemed promising.  The car had 150k miles when I bought it, and it's almost up to 170 now.

While I had the car thoroughly checked out, some parts have given out on me, as I would have expected on an 11-year-old car.  Since I bought it, I've replaced: oxygen sensor, catalytic converter, front struts, left CV axle, both windshield wiper linkage arms, both front brake calipers, and steering rack.  Sure, it's had its fair share of problems, but the engine and tranny are still rock-solid.  I attribute the mass of problems to the way this car must have been mistreated by a previous owner, not to the CRX or the Honda brand.  My mother's old '84 Accord ran over 380K with no real work at all.  Despite the problems I have had I would still recommend the CRX.

The suspension is optimized for performance, not for a soft ride, but the occasional bumps and jolts are well worth this car's mastery of the twisties.  Even though it's FWD, the CRX can hang with the best of them, as body roll and torque steer are non-issues.  The double-wishbone suspension helps the car "handle" or "corner" where the other guys just "turn."  However, the car is very lightweight, which makes it a real pain to drive in any kind of snow.

The engine, a 1.5L SOHC I4, is built for high mileage and a long lifespan.  I have averaged about 38mpg, driving mostly highway miles, but with lots of hilly terrain.  Although it's only 98 HP, the CRX weighs only about 2100 lbs, so it will out-accelerate many vehicles.  The key to driving fast through the twisties is keeping the RPM's up above 3500-4000 for quick acceleration out of turns.

The CRX's super-small body (think Mazda Miata) makes it a breeze to park, even in the tightest of places.  The interior is not the best, as the hatchback area is plagued by rattles.  Both the heater and AC take some time to get going, but work nicely once up to speed.  The seats are VERY comfortable, and I have not trouble fitting in the car even though I'm 6'.  I can't comment on the base stereo, since mine came with a Sony CD, but there is quite a bit of road and engine noise when driving over 50mph.

This is certainly not a car for everybody, but singles in the market for a fun, economical, good-looking ride should check it out.  It's doesn't have sports car power or luxury car fit and finish, but it's a definite winner in it's category.  Compare it to the Ford Festiva or Geo Metro, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the CRX.  Resource.crx.org is a great site for everything about CRX's.
