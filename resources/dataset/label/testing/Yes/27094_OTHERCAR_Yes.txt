            Go ahead...race a stock car in the quarter mile, you'll beat it.  With a huge V10 in the front of this beast you'll have no problem wasting just about any car you see on the road.  I guarantee it.  According to Car and Driver magazine this car does zero to sixty in a jaw dropping 3.3 seconds.  The acceleration on this car is just amazing.  This car may not have a huge trunk or room for the family, in fact this car has a tiny interior, but I highly doubt that when all the females see you driving around in this car that they will say &quot;That car won't fit my groceries.&quot;  Compared to other big name sports cars the Viper really isn't that pricey either.  To be able to go this fast your looking at having to buy Ferraris or Lamborginis and I don't even think they look as good as the Viper.  So let your nipples get hard as you are going to work every day too.<br><br>
