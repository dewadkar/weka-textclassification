            I looked at all the SUVs offering a third row before choosing the MDX. For the money it is by far the best on the market.  You can't beat the reliability and resale value and the market hasn't been saturated with them yet. (i.e. Expedition)
I agree with many of the other reviews listed here on certain annoyances and pros.  The gas mileage isn't great, but it's not all that bad.  I think if the MDX had a larger tank, it wouldn't even cross my mind.  I fill up about every 6 days.
MDX is often compared to the RX330.  It shouldn't be.  For anyone that cares to know.  Acura and Lexus aren't even true competitors.  Acura models itself after European vehicles. (i.e. stiffer suspension, sportier and noisier ride)  Lexus models itself after American luxury (i.e. Cadillac and quiet ride, soft suspension, etc.)  I don't understand the one complaint in a review about the 2nd row seats not reclining.  They don't go parallel to the floor but both 2nd and 3rd row seats recline enough to keep your head from falling forward if you're sleeping on a trip.
Another minor complaint is the plastic door frame on the inside causes scratches when the seat belt clip falls back into place.  That was a lack of attention by Acura.  
Acceleration is great for an SUV.  It feels somewhat sluggish, but if you really put your foot down, it's accelerates quicker than any other SUV in it's class, Murano, included, and can hold it's own with the average sedan.  However, who buys an SUV to race?  It has sufficient power for it's purpose.  It's not too big or too small. Navigation is great and the stereo rocks!  However, speaker covers rattle loose at times and need to be replaced.  I don't know why Acura didn't use screws instead of just popping them in and out.  Overall, I LOVE this vehicle and couldn't have made a better choice.
