            I recently bought a 2001 VW Jetta GLX, galactic blue, with tan leather interior.  Okay, this car just feels good.  The first passenger I took out in the car said, "This is a Volkswagen?  I feel more like I'm in a BMW!"  That's basically what I feel like driving this car everyday, and it usually puts a smile on my face that I paid in the mid 20s instead of the mid 30s for this awesome car.  

The handling is crisp and the acceleration is great, even on the automatic.  Top speed seems to plateau out around 110, but I'm sure I could get it up to 120 or so if I had enough road and no cops were around.  

The Monsoon sound system is absolutely great, but I haven't had the chance to use it with CDs yet considering the Jetta does not come with a CD player.  You can get a factory installed in-dash or 6-disc changer in the trunk.  I've done some searching and found that the Panasonic CX-DP610 works with the VW radio and all controls, and it installs easily in the truck in like 10 minutes.  You just need to buy a converter thingy and set up the mounting brackets.  (Check out www.logjamelectronics.com to get a good deal on this 6-disc trunk changer)

Let's see, what else.  There really isn't much leg room in the back seats, but hey, I'm not sitting back there.  Passengers can be comfortable if I move my seat up a couple of inches, which does not hinder my driving ability at all.  I'm about 5-11.  If you were much bigger, you'd need to have the chair back all the way and anyone sitting behind you would be a little cramped.

The radio and climate controls are located a little bit low for my taste.  There really isn't anywhere else they could go unless you removed the center A/C blower.  Also, there is a small slot where the in-dash CD player would go that is located above the A/C controls and the radio.  The cup holders obstruct this slot when they're in use.  (The cup holders work well with any size cup or can because they are like a spring loaded claw that clamps down on the cup.)

The trunk size is large enough to lay a set of golf clubs flat in the trunk or to hold maybe 20-25 grocery bags.  It is kind of annoying that you have to physically lift the trunk after you unlatch it.  It doesn't automatically pop up to the top position.

The auto-darkening rear view window is great when you're driving on the highway at night and a big truck is behind you.  Normally, you'd be blinded but this great feature spares your eyes.

There is one gimmick feature on the GLX which I think is a complete waste.  Supposedly, it has rain sensing wipers that speed up with more rain and slow down when the rain lightens up.  To me, it seems that the wipers just randomly wipe without any connection to how much rain is collected on the windshield in front of me.  They do automatically stop when the rain stops, so they must work a little bit, at least.

The main thing I love about this car is the appearance inside.  The tan leather contrasting the black "rubber" dash makes the car just look phenomenal.  The wood trim just adds to the look of this car.  I've found it well worth the price tag so far, and I just hope it holds up well for years to come.  

Oh, and they say you're supposed to use premium gas with the VR6 engine.  With gas prices already high, I've been alternating between regular and premium.  If anyone knows any reason why I should NOT do this, please let me know.  I don't want to kill my car.
