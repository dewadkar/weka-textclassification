            I recently bought a 1997 Nissan Sentra. It is for my wife who must drive about 120 miles everyday, on the highway. I did a lot of research on this car before I bought it, using a wide variety of web sites, consumer reports magazine, and recommendations from mechanics. 

When I was shopping for this car, I used this guide:
1) It must be safe
2) It should get over 30 miles per gallon of gasoline
3) It should cost under $9,000
4) It should be less than 3 years old
5) It should have a reputation for getting high mileage
6) It must have less than 80,000 miles on it

I found that the two best cars that fit my requirements were the Honda Civic and the Nissan Sentra. After hunting around my area, I realized that there were very few Civic's available and I'd have to get a Sentra. We found one that cost $9,200, had 49,500 miles on it, had a standard transmission, and was a 1997 model.

The car gets very good gas mileage (about 33 miles to the gallon). It rides very well, and the steering is surprisingly crisp. It handles quite well in the rain and wind. It is relatively safe for a small car, has excellent resale value, and seems to be very reliable (we've had it for about 6 months now).

I am unhappy about its lack of power on hills. Its four-cylinder engine doesn't provide much acceleration, which can be annoying. I also find the car to be a bit cramped. There are no armrests, and the cabin feels small (it is a small car). Larger people won't like this car very much: there isn't quite enough room around the steering wheel and shifter. Also, the gas, clutch, and brake are too close to each other for my liking. However, my wife has no complaints. She loves it. That's good news, since she is the primary driver.

Summary: This is an economical little car that gives you good bang for your buck. Use it for trips around town and reasonable commutes, but leave it at home for long trips. It is also an excellent second car or college car. I expect it to last for at least another 100,000 miles.
