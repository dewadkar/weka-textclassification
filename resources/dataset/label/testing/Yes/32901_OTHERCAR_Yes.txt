            I have owned many digital cameras, including ones from Sony, Kodak, and several Canon ones. The S300 is essentially a S100/S110 type Elph Camera with a better optical zoom than it's little brothers. Canon has really done a good job, with a great overall package, in terms of design, picture quality, and hi-quality of the product.

Design: The best selling Digital Elph has done it again with consistent, high quality design. The sleek case nicely complements the high-tech features of the camera. All the buttons are well placed, within easy reach. And the user functions are all quite intuitive. I also like how the same interface is used to access the USB and the RCA Video out functionality.

Software: Probably the best suite of software for both Mac and PC. (Mac OS X support is native to OS 10.1!!) For once, the manufacturer did not skimp on Mac software. The photo Zoom browser software for PC is especially powerful, allowing you to easily organize and browse thru hundreds of pictures in many folders.

Photo Quality: Photo quality is on par with the other Canon Digital Elph cameras. When printed out on high quality paper by Ofoto.com or on nice quality paper on a decent inkjet printer at home, you can barely tell that they are digital photos! The camera does have a tendency to give people Red Eye in dark rooms if you forget to set the red-eye reduction, so be careful. Colors are bright and vibrant, and requires little additonal touch up on the computer!

Accessories: Unlike some of the Low End Sony  models, Canon has always supplied their best Li-Ion rechargeable batteries with their cameras. I have found that the battery life is excellent, easily 50-60 pictures without a recharge (and probably longer!), the included 8MB CF card is on the skimpy card, so at today's prices you'll want to get at least a 64MB card, to save yourself the constant downloading to your computer.

Probably the only down side to this camera is the relatively high price when compared to current 2.1 megapixel cameras. Also, unless you are dying fo the 3x optical zoom, I'd probably pick the S110 due to the small size of the camera. 

The smaller the camera is, the more likely you will carry it around and make use of it!
