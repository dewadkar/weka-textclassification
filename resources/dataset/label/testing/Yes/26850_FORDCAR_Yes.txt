            This is one big car!  The Expo has tons of creature comforts, and feels well put together.  On the flip side, that can be interpreted to mean it drives like a drunk whale.
We have a sort of cobalt blue Eddie Bauer with the Triton 5.4L engine.  The engine feels strong, and lugs this thing around with a lot more zip than you might expect.  No one will confuse this with a sprightly vehicle, though, and when you have to turn the beast, that monstrous weight shows up with authority.  While equipped with load-leveling springs at the back, body lean is still a little scary, reminiscient of those Isuzu Troppers of the mid-90's.
That extra weight is not often well spent.  The Expedition truly revels in its excess as you look in the passenger compartment.  To its credit, the seats are supremely comfortable, to my butt the best in class.  The view outward-or should I say downward?-is commanding to say the least.  You are literally on eye-level with bus drivers.  It's a real hike to get up in the drivers seat, and I'm 6'2&quot;.  Now, granted, once I'm in, it's a nice size.  Having driving SUV's all my life, it's not so hard to get this in parking spaces or other tight spots.  People coming from smaller cars will find this thing to be akin to getting on the New York subway with a gigantic backpack.
The driver's seat pretty much contains everything you need, and so much you don't.  The seat warmers are a nice touch on cold days, as are the auto lights that are noticeably absent from my Durango.  The sound system is, in a word, mindblowing, with deep rich bass and nicely clear highs.  Also nice (I guess, for the ultimate couch potato) is the auto climate control, which is adequate.  Things no car should have or need: adjustable pedals (does ANYONE actually say, &quot;ya know, it'd be a great car, but the pedals!  So far away!), the millions of settings for the radio, and the radio controls for the backseat (the ultimate in driver annoyance).  Things missing that I really miss: steering wheel radio controls (once you have 'em, you never want to go without), a functional auto-dimmer mirror, and a more functional trip computer.  I guess these are things the Durango has that the go-go-gadget Expo doesn't, and should.
One thing I like a lot is the sunroof, which gives the cabin an even larger, airier feel.
Gas mileage, for such a large car, is almost reasonable, probably hanging around 14 mpg.  The car looks very good, inside and out, and the materials feel well chosen.  The lift gate is a little maddening, but once gotten used to, is fine.  The 4 wheel drive feels like its faking it, with a little clicky knob to turn.
In all, this is a very nice car: there's a reason the brother navigator is the choice of tons of sports stars.  It's roomy, it's got a ridiculous level of creature comforts, and is a self-esteem boost every time you get in a peer down at the peons.  But driving it just feels pondorous and laborious.  I'd like to try the new Tahoe, and I think I'd still take my Durango over this one and spend the extra dollars on an equivalent sound system.
