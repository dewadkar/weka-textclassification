            It's not even 2001 yet, but Toyota's newest hybrid electric/gasoline 4 door sedan priced at $19,995 (plus destinations charges) hits the road today.

I recently had the opportunity to test drive &quot;Prius&quot; after reading current information posted at their website and was very impressed. When I first arrived at South Bay Toyota, I was in awe looking at the Prius. I circled the vehicle several times, looking it over: the paint job, the wheels, the spoiler, and anxiously peering inside. From the outside, the car looks very aerodynamic, with its low sloping front end, along with a roomy cabin which could be mistaken for a Camry (well almost! more like Corolla I suppose). 

I was greeted by a salesperson.

I asked for him to pop the hood so I could see inside. The engine looked pretty cramped but compact in design. Then I looked at the interior of the car. The doors were solid, you can tell by the way you open and close them. The seats with made of a cloth fabric, and there were two instrument panels. One is the digital speedometer which is high visible near the center of the dash located at the front most part of the windshield. This lets you and the passenger see how fast you're going on the open road. Second, there is an active matrix computer display that's logically placed within reach of you and your traveling buddy. The computer displays constant feedback of engine performance, charging status/capabilities and outside temperature. Salesman noted, that charging the batteries is never needed, give it gas and drive. &quot;There's no need to charge the batteries...Everything is automated,&quot; he said. The charging is done passively when you brake and coast. Of course Toyota's biggest selling point for this car is the fact it's half gas and half electric. They claim 56/mpg in the city and 45/mpg for highway. Most of those who do the city commute like I do can really benefit. That's double the mileage I'm getting from my car. Wow!

I couldn't resist, so I took it for a spin.

The vehicle has adequate power (not a sports car by any means). It's a 4 cylinder engine with a stylish spoiler. It's very quiet and rides like a larger car. Very comfortable seating for 4-5 people. The car has a smooth transmission and is available only in automatic. The vehicle is front wheel drive with front disc brakes (standard ABS) and rear drums in the back. I really love the car and am planning to order the car. Right now, Toyota is taking orders and will be delivering the product coming November/December. 

My only gripe about the car is the lack of trunk space and the fact a in dash CD player doesn't come standard. The area is quite small for this car, because the fixed lead acid batteries are seated behind the rear seat of the vehicle. Because, of this design, the rear seats don't fold forward to provide more space for longer stowaways. Regarding the CD player, there is no space provided for you to install an after market CD player without wrecking the look of the ergonomic dash of the Prius. I think Toyota intended for people to add their factory option for a trunk mounted cd changer for this car.

Overall, I give a thumbs way up for someone who does a lot of city driving/commuting to work who wants to cut energy costs by half. Buying this car would be a smarter alternative to those gas guzzling American sports cars/big fullsize trucks.
