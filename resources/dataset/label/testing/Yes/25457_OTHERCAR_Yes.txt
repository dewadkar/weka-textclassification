            We had a 92 geo metro. Yes, I know, a green bug! We were expecting our 2nd child in Feb of 98. We decided in January of 98 to buy another car. We went car shopping, and tried a dealership that would be happy to give us a car with 19% interest! We tried another one, 21% interest, and yet one more..the Saturn dealership.
We went in and were kind of leary about buying a car after the last 2 dealers. We looked around, decided we needed a SL. A plain model SL.
We test drove it and absolutely fell in love with it. This car is a smooth ride, a quiet ride and had lots of room in it.  
We decided, this is it. We want this car.
We spoke with a salesman and we found out it was less than what we paid for the Geo Metro!
We have now had our red Saturn SL, for 2 years this month. We have taken it in for routine oil changes. When we take it in there, it is only $15 for the oil change!  They hook it up to a machine that tests the electrical system for free! They wash it and vacuum it, for free!
We were driving it through a car wash the other day and for some reason water was spraying our faces! The seal around the door had came loose. I called the Saturn dealership and they said &quot;Bring it right in&quot;. We took it in and they replaced all the seals on all the doors, for free.
Great car, we have not had anything go wrong with it except for the seals, which they took care of immediately.
Driving this car is great. There is no &quot;windy&quot; sounds while driving on the highways. The shocks absorb the &quot;bumps&quot; wonderfully! 
There is a lot of room for 2 adults, 1 9yr old and a 23 month old with a carseat and diaper bag. We still have lots of room left over!  
I love the fact that the seats fold down in the back. Easy access to the trunk! Great for putting my husbands 2x4's in!
We use this car for trips, highway travel, used it in 18 inches of snow (we live in IL), handles well on ice.
I think its a great car for the money!
I also think that is a safe car. Dent resistant panels, metal bars in the doors where, if you were in a crash, the bars would help keep the door from smashing in on you. 
I feel you get great safety in these cars. I would recommend to anyone, especially parents!<br><br>
