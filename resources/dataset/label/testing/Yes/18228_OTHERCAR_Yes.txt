            I just recently purchased an 1998 Integra RS.  This a nice trendy car and has nice handling and adequate power.  While my model only has 140 hp its pretty easy to speed in her.  Going around corners is nice, the car has a little body roll but I would say it has above average handling. 

If you are looking for a sports car, I wouldn't recommend the Integra unless you get the Type R.  The regular version is a nice balanced ride but don't be expecting a pocket rocket.  Compared to my old Honda CRX it doesn't feel as driver friendly and compared to my Nissan 300ZX, there is no comparison the 300ZX is by far nicer but also cost way more to maintain.  The interior needs work, it's plain and spartan which can be a good thing, but I would at least expect a more cockpit type of interior for the driver.  It reminds me more of a Civic.  The seats are nice and support you firmly when corning hard.  

The shifting is very good, typical Honda quality.  Engine loves to be reved but the lack of low end power is the price you pay for fuel efficiency.

This car has a cult following but personally I don't like it as much because of this.  If you want individuality look for something else, but if you want reliability and a nice car and don't mind there being lot of others ones out there then the Integra is for you.

Update - I have now driven the car for 3 months and I am liking it more and more, especially since I put in lowering springs to increase the handling, the car has little body roll and really sticks to the road more.  The stock suspension really is not all the suited for a sport coupe, because it is way too soft.
