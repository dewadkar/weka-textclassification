            There are a few cars that combine pizazz and practicality well enough that they can draw a crowd at a car show on Saturday afternoon, then take you to work Monday through Friday.  Some cars stand out from the hoards of Corvettes, Jaguars, and Porsches, gathering admirers, turning heads, and starting conversations everywhere they go.  For most enthusiasts, the Viper, Prowler, and some Ferraris come to mind.

So should the DeLorean.

There is no mistaking a DeLorean as it first pulls up to you.  The bare stainless steel skin gleams like no paint in the world, and its fuel injected V-6 idles restlessly as the DeLorean comes to a stop.  The crisp lines of its Italian-styled body sing the song of exotica that draws men and boys alike.  Now the engine stops and, at the moment when other cars let you down, your DeLorean encounter reaches its climax.  Quietly and effortlessly, its sleek gullwing doors reach for the sky.  For a moment the DeLorean looks like a futuristic spacecraft.

Then the whispering starts.  Everyone knows that the DeLorean Motorcars Company met its end in a sensational scandal, a scandal that even today continues to make headlines around the world.  It is a colorful and exciting story, made more so by the fanciful rumors that sprang up at the time.  No car, not even a Tucker, can match the DeLorean as a conversation starter.

Considering that its head-turning abilities can match those of any car ever made, the DeLorean is surprisingly easy to own.  Parts are plentiful and inexpensive, technical information is easy to find, and DeLoreans require less maintenance than most cars their age thanks to the durability stainless body.  I can operate my DeLorean for roughly the same cost as a Volvo or Saab of the same vintage.

I am the proud owner of a DeLorean that was made in May of 1981, when I was still in high school.  Today I am 36 years old and my DeLorean is almost 20.  Because the body is stainless steel, the engine is aluminum, and the underbody is fiberglass I fully expect the driveable life of this car to outlast me by centuries.

As much fun as I have with my DeLorean, I would love to own a Duesenberg or a Lamborghini.  But even if I owned both of these classics, I would seldom drive them to the office or grocery store.  To reiterate: there is only one car that combines head turning of an exotic with the practicality of a daily driver.  That car is the DeLorean.

Other useful facts:

The DeLorean gets excellent fuel economy.  Sticking to the 65 mph speed limit, my 5-speed with 2 passengers and minimal luggage once got almost 29 mpg on an all highway trip.

When you drive a DeLorean you get used to minimal luggage.  As with the Porsche 911 and other two-seaters, space is limited.

The brushed stainless body is very easy to clean, and never needs wax.  Best of all, minor scratches can be removed with the stroke of an ordinary Scotchbrite pad!

All DeLoreans came with a Pugeot-Renault-Volvo V-6 engine and drivetrain.  Many owners enhance its performance with aftermarket options like turbochargers.  While it handles like a &quot;thinly disguised racing machine&quot; performance is on par with a Porsche 944.

The DeLorean is perhaps the best sportscar ever made for a tall person.  When the gullwing door opens it lifts part of the roof, so you do not need to duck as you enter the car.  I am 6'1&quot; and the DeLorean gives me many generous inches of headroom, much more than my wife's Porsche.

Unlike the Bricklin, the DeLorean's gullwing doors are well designed and reliable.  They are lifted by cryotwist torsion bars made by Grumman Aviation for aircraft and spacecraft hatches.

As stated above, DeLorean parts are plentiful.  Both of the websites below will lead you to a number of vendors who specialize in DeLorean parts and service.

Contrary to popular belief, there is a magazine dedicated exclusively to DeLoreans.  It is published by the DeLorean Owners Association.  Information is available at www.delorean-owners.org

You can find out about the experiences of hundreds of DeLorean owners, many who drive their DeLoreans every day, on the DeLorean Mailing List at www.dmcnews.com

As I write this (September, 2000) DeLorean prices are very reasonable.  There has never been a better time to buy than right now!<br><br>
