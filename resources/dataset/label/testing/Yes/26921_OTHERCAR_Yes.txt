            This car is a masterpiece in itself. It in my opinion is the mast comfortble car on the road. i have some friend that own Toyota Camerys and they love theres too. If anyone says &quot;Oh, the Camery isn't as goof as an Accord&quot; or any other car do not believe them. We have had ours for about two years and we havn't even had the tiniest problem with it. The gas milage is great. we only have the four cylender engine but this baby has some real power. If you want a smooth ride then look no futher this is it. In my opinion and in the opinion of everyone that I know, the Camery is a great car and probably the best car there is.<br><br>
