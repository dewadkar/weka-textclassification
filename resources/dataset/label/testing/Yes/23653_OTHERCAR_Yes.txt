            This camera was purchased to replace an old HP photosmart camera (<a href='/content_60714552964'>http://www.epinions.com/content_60714552964</a>) because I hated the HP camera. After doing some research on digital cameras, it came down to either the FinePix 2650 or the Sony Cybershot DSC-P31. Although the Sony came with rechargable batteries, it didn't have optical zoom and only has an 8MB memory stick (The FinePix comes with a 16MB xD card) So I bought the Fuji.

One of my main concerns was battery life. From previous experience with digital cameras (my old HP) battery life was horrible. I somehow expected the Fuji to be the same, thinking that all digital cameras were known for eating batteries (don't know why I thought that)
Battery life is great though. I put in the 2 AA alkalines that came with the camera and took pictures of things around the house. I took pictures of my dog. I took pictures of my room, and some other things, just to test it out. So far, I've probably taken at least 75 pictures with the original batteries, and I've transferred them to my computer. The low battery warning light just came on tonight, after several shots. Even with the low battery light on, the camera is still taking pictures. I did buy some Ni-MH rechargeables for the camera to save me money, but I don't know how well they'll do because they're charging for the first time right now.

Picture quality is awesome with the highest setting. No blurriness or pixelation. The pictures come out clean and sharp.
I took a picture of the inside of my computer (because I had nothing better to take a picture of) and was expecting the fan blades to come out blurry, since they're spinning at around 3,000 RPMs. But I was wrong. Take a look at http://www.geocities.com/yourgod17/fan.html and notice the big orange fan. You'd never know that fan is spinning at 3,000 RPMs from that picture. This camera is awesome for motion shots.

USB connectivity is great. Image transfers are fast, and the camera shows up as a removable drive in My Computer, so you can just copy pictures from the camera to your hard drive in Windows Explorer (a lot easier than messing with software)

The camera is a bit thick, so it won't easily fit in your pocket, but it definitley isn't made out of cheap plastic. I don't think dropping it a few inches onto a hard surface will hurt it. (but I won't try it)

My only complaint about this camera is the proprietary storage format, the xD card. I would prefer something more common such as a CompactFlash or SmartMedia card, so if I ever got a PDA, I could put the camera's card in the PDA and view the pictures, but I cant with the xD card. But the xD cards are about the same price as all other flash media, so I'm not too upset about the xD cards. I also would have liked rechargeable batteries to be included, but I guess you can't have everything, can you?
