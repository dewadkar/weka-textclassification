            Chevy Blazer's are the ultimate vehicles for young couples with small families. I purchased a Blazer after the birth of my daughter to ensure that she would have a nice vehicle to ride in as well as enough space not to feel crowded. I also purchased this vehicle because it allows me to cruise with my friends from time to time. When I go grocery shopping, I can rest assured that there is enough space for my groceries. Also I can participate effectively in the workforce carpool knowing that I have enough room for four additional passengers. I really believe that a Blazer is the vehicle that anyone can drive on any occasion. If you are at a loss for what type of vehicle to purchase, I strongly reccommend that you purchase a Blazer, you definitely won't regret it.<br><br>
