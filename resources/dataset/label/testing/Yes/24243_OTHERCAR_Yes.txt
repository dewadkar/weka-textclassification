            I am the proud owner of my second Chevrolet Tahoe.  I purchased my first one in 1995, the first year they were made as the full-sized SUV.  It had previously been known as the K-5 Blazer.  With 4 doors and a folding rear seat, it had plenty of room for all my antique auction treasures as well as plenty of room  when I traveled.  I was single at the time and had part ownership of an antique shop. My first Tahoe gave me over 100,000 miles of
trouble-free service.  The air conditioner ran full-time in the summers and my only repair was a $25 switch!  I traded in my 1995 model on a 1998
model and it too, has so far, been trouble free.  There is plenty of room for 5 adults and plenty of gear.  I am married with a 2-year old son now and when we travel to auctions or to visit my family, it's great to have all the room and luxury the Tahoe offers.  I love everything about my Tahoe and hate nothing!  Any family would be proud to have this fine vehicle, even if they cost as much as a small house used to cost!  That's the only thing I don't like about the Tahoe - the extremely high price!
