            I bought this vehicle last year because of my need for a car that could transport a family or four and alot of luggage. My son plays on his highschool varsity hockey team. Because of this we have to travel all of the time. We have to travel through every condition you can think of. Imagine driving through snow, sleet, rain, or anything from 2-12 hours straight. You can not find anything that could do it better than a suburban. I have not had any major problems with my Suburban. I absolutly love this car. It is a very nice looking car also. It has a great sound system and it rides better than any other suv that I can think of. When you drive a suburban you feel like your in control. You feel power behind the wheel of a Suburban. If you have a family of 4 or more the Suburban is the car for you. If you have to cart a lot of people around all the time then you want a suburban. It is a good everyday car that you can feel safe driving<br><br>
