            The Honda has always had a good reputation in the car industry.  I knew I wanted a Honda Accord and I bought one.  It is a nice sized car.  Not too big or too small.  The EX model has the V-Tec engine.  This engine allows you to get up and go.  There is never any doubt in my mind if my car will be able to get me into fast moving traffic.  The CD player and stereo are amazing for being a manufacturer's stereo.    It drives very smooth and handles well.  However, after riding in a Toyota Camry which was a couple of years older than my Accord, I felt that my car was lacking in this department.  The Camry has a quieter engine and a smoother ride.  Overall, I'm very please with my car.  I feel I got my $14,000 worth.  I haven't had any problems and hope my luck lasts.  <br><br>
