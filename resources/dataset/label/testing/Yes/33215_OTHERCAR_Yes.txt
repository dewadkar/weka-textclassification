            All Hondas are known as cars that last for a lifetime. Well.... maybe not, but they have a significant life span that appeals to the consumer because of good quality, great styling and easy upgrading. Without a doubt, this car is quite possibly one of the best on the market and I highly recommend to anyone who is need for a new &quot;used&quot; car.

I purchased this car because I crashed my other 1993 Honda Accord EX (which I also have a review on, so be sure to read it!). I was really in need for a new car. I decided that I'll give my favorite brand of cars another shot by purchasing a newer model. Except this model is a 1997 Accord LX-V6. Read on to see the pros and cons of this car.

Pros:

- Excellent styling
- V6 motor
- Cloth interior
- Low gas cost
- Great manual

Cons:

- My car came with over 117,000 miles!
- Small aspects of the car could have been better, but that's just nit-picking.

Let's start off with the positives. This car has a nice shape as with the other models. As a 4-door sedan, my car is very roomy and I even have enough room for 4-5 6-foot tall (and over) buddies of mine. Next, although my car is a 4-cylinder, is has a very powerful V6 motor that pretty much stands in a class of its own. Also, as with most of the other models (primarily the Honda Civic), Honda has mastered what it takes to be a low gas saver. Although not as good as my old car, the car will run on half a tank of gas lasting for a couple days to a week. 

Now for the negatives. Even though my car was used, it came with over 117,000 miles. I fear that this will break down my car soon, but Honda has assured me that they are built to last. Small things like the A/C, stereo, or even the SRS Airbag system could have been a lot better.

Overall, this car is perfect for teenagers, grown-ups, old people, or whatever. The many positives will attract people for a long-time to come. As for me, I think that I will take a spin in my car now.
