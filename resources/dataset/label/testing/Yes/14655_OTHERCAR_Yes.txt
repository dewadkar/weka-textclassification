            I've had this car for a bit over a year now.  And I am very happy with it but before I get into that I should say something about why I bought it.

Why I bought:  I was looking for a small and reliable car. My first thought was  a Toyota as I had several of them over the years and was very happy with them. But I did not like the styling changes of recent years (specifically, the inability to see the back end of the car when looking out the rear window). This seemed to be a common trait in most cars made in the past few years.  So it seemed I'd need a spoiler (even though I did not like them) or maybe a small wagon.  So I read Consumer and Subaru was very highly rated (comparable to Toyota and Honda as I recall).  I visited quite a few dealers and the wagon I liked best was the Legacy.  I saw the Forester on the lot, drove it, and liked it even more.  So it was back to the books.  It was also highly rated for both reliability and safety. It did cost a bit more but I think it was worth it. Especially as I am the type who keeps a car a long time (I still have a 1983 Volvo and a 1986 Toyota.)

What I like:  I like that it is a fun car to drive.  And YES, it does drive like a small car.  It is very maneuverable.  It has a very strong 4 cylinder engine.  So it gets very good mileage (about 25 mpg) like a 4. But when driving it seems to have power more like a 6.  It has the power to pass on the interstate and accelerate rapidly when needed. I like sitting higher than a car.  I like the visibility in all directions. The seats are comfortable for long trips.  All wheel drive (AWD) is a big safety plus.  It is great on the highway as it improves traction by automatically shifting power among the wheels as road conditions change.  For me the usefulness is mainly in the rain.  Living in Atlanta, I don't have much experience with snow and ice.  Small touches like map lights and extra storage compartments are nice.  I also like that it seems require little maintenance.  Other than changing the oil every 3 months and a 7500 mile service ($62), I've not had to do anything.

What it is not:  This car is not for everyone. It is a small car with some SUV characteristics.  If you need to haul lots of stuff or your family is big, you may prefer a full-sized SUV or maybe even a mini-van. If you do serious off-the-road stuff you may prefer 4WD to AWD. Although it is considered a 5 passenger car, I think 3 adults would be cramped in back if they went any distance. Two adults or teenagers would probably be fine.   Three small children would be OK in back but children have a tendency to grow and in 5 or 10 years the Forester will probably still be doing fine but those small children won't be so small anymore.

So I'd highly recommend the Forester if it fits your needs.  The price might seem a bit high but remember this is a quality vehicle and the price probably includes standard equipment which may be optional on other models. (Power windows, power mirrors, and air conditioning come to mind.)

Note added Feb 2001:  I finally found something I don't like.  I guess you could consider it a minor issue since it took a year and a half before I noticed.  I know they taught us in drivers ed that you should adjust the mirrors before driving but I usually forget until I need the mirors and the dome light is already out.  The control for the power side mirrors is on the door and is not lit in any way.  Oddly the only control on the door that lights is the driver's window. So if you want to adjust the mirrors, use the power door locks, or even lock the window controls, you must feel around in the dark.  It's a minor annoyance.  Adjusting the side mirrors in the dark is something that only comes up occasionally but it sure would be nice to have some light to do it by. By the way, I still like the car very much.
