            Ok, I've looked at other reviews for the new Nissan Altima and want to counter some of the opinions, based on our extensive Altima history.  Our first Altima, was a '94 GXE.  That car saved our life literally a couple of times.  We jumped to a Pathfinder in '96, but decided we needed something smaller, after having so many problems with that.  We ended up getting the '99 Altima SE.  The SE handled the road great, but had lots of road noise and tight suspension, and as you get older, and creak a bit more in the bones (I'm only 31, but have arthritis), you tend to not thrive on the sportier suspension.  Yesterday, yes, just yesterday, we turned in our SE since we were at the end of our lease.  We were planning on doing a lease buyout, but it turns out, we could get a NEW Altima for less money than what it would be to buy the old one (and the bumper to bumper was about to expire), so it was a no brainer for us.  We need reliable transportation, not saying the '99 wasn't reliable, but you always feel safer in a new car when there's no worry about warranty!
Anyway, we were kind of put into a position where we didn't even test drive one out.  That's right, we signed the papers before even turning on the engine.  Our little girl went with us to pick out the color, though she promised me my turn the next time around.  We decided on Velvet Beige.
We get into our new Altima and instantly notice several things.  Room, LOTS of room compared to the '99.  Don't know what to do with all that leg room.  I turn around to strap my daughter into her booster, and I can't reach.  Large cabin, that's for sure.  Next thing we notice, the colors inside don't all quite go together.  It seems Nissan had several people plan out the colors, on different days, in different lights. The differences are slight, but to us, noticeable.  The design of the interior is different than what I'm used to, with sharper edges than our SE, but I will get used to it.  We have gone from a Sport Edition, to a Mid Size Family Sedan.  
Security, window etching is already done, so all you have to do is register the vin number.  There is a microchip in each key, that sends a signal to the engine to let it start: if you don't have a key, engine won't run, period.
We ended up with a basic package, but one that includes a compass in the rearview mirro that shows direction and cabin temp digitally.  
Now for the real test.  Oh darn! I forgot my license at home when I was doing paperwork!  Husband drove it home for 15 miles.  It was like Driving with Miss Daisy.  He poked the whole way and I was just DYING to feel the difference.  The salesperson assured me that the new 175 hp engine would be comparable to our SE's.  With husband driving, you'd never know there was more than a few dozen hamsters powering the engine.
We get home, we eat dinner, and I grab my keys.  Now it's MY turn to test drive this baby.
Initially, going from a sport suspension, I notice the steering to be looser and not as responsive, but that's ok, we're in a sedan, not a stock race car. I begin to accelerate and whoosh, the car takes off.  Ok, I know you're not supposed to "punch it" when the vehicle is new, and I respected that, but I needed open road to see how this baby was going to pass tractor trailers.  I get out and push it carefully to 55, but enough that I can feel the car's torque zones.  Feels great so far. Turning is fine, not as tight as the SE, but doing quite well considering this bugger is LONGER than the previous model. 
My only real problem with this vehicle?  The pumpkin orange night display on the dashboard.  And I mean pumpkin.  It glares at you and you feel your face is looking at the sun. I"m going to have to adjust that, but for now, this nice, redesigned model is sitting in our driveway sleeping peacefully...until I take her out again. Will have to get used to that awful redesigned 6 speed automatic shifter too.
