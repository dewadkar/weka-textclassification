            I recently borrowed a Sony MVC-FD88, and let me tell you I will be getting one soon.
The large LCD screen was an extremely nice feature.
Takes great picstures, and is very easy to use. You do not have to be experienced with photography or electronis gadgets to get great pics with this camera.
The 16x zoom is awesome, I photographed items for e-commerce sites and ebay with this camera and really enjoyed the zoom for this reason :
I had my work area set up with camera on tripod and a stand for photographing items on. You can shoot several items of varying sizes without having to move anything, just zoom in and out to fit the item to the screen. Even on extreme close ups I didn't notice much image quality deteriation.
Gotta love the battery life indicator that reads out in minutes too.<br><br>
