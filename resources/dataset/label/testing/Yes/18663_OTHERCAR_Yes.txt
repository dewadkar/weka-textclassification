            OK, let's get the details down from the start:  I am *NOT* a minivan kinda guy.  I own an Acura Integra, and the very thought of driving a minivan would send me running for the hills.  So what changed?

In a word--MARRIAGE.  In 4 words, Marriage with 3 kids.  Kinda hard to seat 5 in an Integra.

So, we went shopping.  We shopped, shopped, and shopped some more--since October.  We took test drives, read reports and reviews, and asked people who owned.

I have to admit, I was kind of biased towards Honda, since my Integra has been just wonderful;  over 130K miles without a hint of trouble except for normal wear & tear.  So, when we test-drove the Odyssey, I started out expecting more than I had from, say the Kia, or the Toyota.  I am happy to say that the Odyssey met my expectations--and then blew them away.

I won't detail the basics; you can go to www.hondacars.com to get those.  So why did I buy an Odyssey?

POWER/HANDLING:  The Odyssey comes standard with a 3.5L V6.  "So what", you say, "so do other minivans".  Well, the ingenious Honda engineers have taken the VTEC engine that first debuted with the Prelude and tweaked it for the Odyssey;  I get 240HP out of this engine -- more than on my Integra!  It's coupled with a 5-speed automatic transmission (yes, FIVE speed) with Grade Logic Control, which means that you can pass on the interstate or on country roads without wishing for a tailwind.  The brakes are 4-wheel disc, with independent double-wishbone suspension in the rear.  65 MPH at around 2300 RPM--quiet, efficient, and easy to handle!

ROOM:  This thing is HUGE.  Plenty of cargo space with all three rows of seats filled, and plenty of seating configurations.  The third-row seat just folds away--never have to remove it, and if you've ever had to remove a bench seat, you know what a pain THAT is!  The second-row bucket seats are easy to remove, and can be pushed together for a pseudo-bench seat if desired.  

SAFETY:  Side airbags complement front airbags for driver and front-seat passenger.  three-point harnesses for all passengers.  Anti-lock brakes, traction control system, electronic brake distribution system.  'Nuff said.

CONVENIENCE:  I could go on and on--OK, I will!  First off, BOTH side doors are powered;  two buttons on the remote keyless entry opens them.  Some folks don't like them, I guess, but when you are trying to herd three kids into a van, while it's raining, they are a GODSEND.  Yes, they can be annoying (it took me about 10 mins to figure out they WON'T open if you are not in "park"), but overall I'd much rather have them than not.

Automatic climate control is another neat perk.  No more sliding the control from hot to cold to hot;  set a temperature and it's maintained.  A sunlight sensor detects if you are in direct sunlight and turns up the cooling to keep you comfortable BEFORE you heat up.  Rear heating/cooling is nifty too, and can be overrriden up front if the kids play too much.

Single-disc CD player is standard, and comes with controls on the steering wheel;  no more reaching over to find a station, or turn up/down the volume.

There are so many more "wow, that's nice!" things about this minivan, but I'll stop here.  I'll just say one thing more:  Read the reviews (Edmunds, Consumer Reports, Car & Driver, etc).  Check out the resale values.  Do a side-by side comparison at sites like carpoint.com.  Then you decide.

The downside of all this, of course, is that the Odyssey is a HOT seller--and the dealers know it.  Do not expect much wiggle room on the price.  I contacted 8 dealers in three states and they were within $200 of each other on drive-away costs.

Another thing I would have liked is more power outlets--there's only two in the vehicle (one up front, one in the cargo area).  Did you know that Hondas do not have ashtrays anymore?  They are OPTIONS now.  Cool by me, but the smokers out there might not like that!

Overall, though, we are EXTREMELY happy with this vehicle, more so than we expected.  We paid about $2000 more than we would have liked, but for Honda quality and value I feel it's worth it!
