            I purchased my pre-owned 1996 GXE Nissan ALTIMA in 1997 from the dealer for $13,500 with around 20,000 miles on it.  The car is fairly priced since i couldn't afford a 1996 Honda Accord at that time, i bought a Altima instead.
    I was happy that i made this purchase instead of the Honda due to that the acceleration is very good (150hp), the car has good handling, the interior instruments are set-up nice and simple, the chairs are comfortable, fairly roomy trunk and interior (fits 5 people but 4 very comfortably), and the fuel economy is very good with almost 220 miles/ full tank on a automatic GXE (depending on how you drive), and excellent power windows and door locks.  The Altima is very reliable though since I presently now have around 128,000 miles on it and it still runs no different than the day i bought it (with the regularly scheduled car maintenance).  The style is nice and stylish, and the window view (front, rear, and side windows) is very good.  Another aspect of the Altima that i would say is excellent is the sport shift button that transfers the car from D-gear to 3rd gear.  On the way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, the 15 Highway has many steep hills and when i switch to 3rd gear with the sport shift button, the performance was excellent with four adults in the car.
    There are some negative aspects on the car though.  The car itself tends to sway left and right somewhat driving at higher speeds, the brakes tend to squeak very often even after you have changed new brake pads, the noise reduction level when you have you're windows up is not so good (you can still hear many noises outside of the car), the brightness adjuster for the interior front panel tends to break often, the radio antenna tends to malfunction, the light display for the gears (ex. P,R,N,D,2,1) tends to go on and off, and the break lights are used up quickly.
     Maybe i'm not giving this car enough benefit of the doubt since these are the problems I experience, but the car itself overall is a car with endurance, but with slight problems.
