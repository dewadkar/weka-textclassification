            We purchased a new 99 Camry and it is a great car.  There is enough room for the whole family without feeling like you are driving a boat.  The trunk space is large which is nice as I carry around a double stroller and playpen at all times and am still able to put groceries and such in there.  I would definitely recommend the remote keyless entry if you have kids.  We didn't get this feature and could really use it.  The car drives good in all weather conditions.  It has daytime running lights and a censor on the dash that automatically turns your regular lights on when it gets dark.  You could never leave your lights on since it also shuts them off automatically when you take your key out of the ignition.  All in all this is a great car for the price, not to big and not to small for a family of four. <br><br>
