            First off, this was not <i>my</i> vehicle, but I did drive it a lot and came to love it! In 1995, my mom and dad decided to lease a car for the first time. They chose this brand new, 1996 Honda LX Sedan, a beautiful white car with power everything and an expensive car phone thrown in just to make the deal sweeter. I for one am glad they chose this car, I felt like I was riding around town in luxury!  

I didn't get my drivers license right away when I turned 16 and was getting ready to try for it not long after my parents leased this car. Lucky me, I got to take my drivers test in it! This could have turned out bad for the simple fact that I wasn't used to driving this car. It was bigger than the car I had been practicing the parallel parking with. During my parking test, I <i>almost</i> hit a cone, but luckily did not and passed my test. I finally had my license!

Now pretty much every time I had to go somewhere I would ask to borrow the Honda. The car I had was old and ugly, so any chance I had to drive the Honda, I took. I still remember what a smooth ride this car was, it really did feel like luxury! It had an awesome CD changer, and the hands-free phone was killer. The acceleration was excellent and the power everything just had me loving the car, wanting it all to myself!

From what I've read, Honda's are usually synonymous with high-quality, reliable, fun-to-drive transportation. I back this up 100%! Unfortunately I can not afford a brand new Honda Accord at this moment, but when I can, I will have one. The car I have now is a 1990 Honda Civic... close enough for now. The Accord consistently appears on many top ten lists for magazines, which reassures me how reliable and safe the car is. This car literally started my love of Honda's...<br><br>
