            Sleek- aerodynamic- sexy- you name it- this car is it. 
I purchased my 1990 LSC in the fall of 1995. I think I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 for her with 82,995 miles on the odometer. Yes- it was kind of high- but the condition of the car was immaculate. 
Yes- she has cost $$$$$ to maintain, and the air suspension works flawlessly. But- when it does have a problem- it is a relatively easy repair. DO IT YOURSELF!- 
The dealership wanted 1500.00 minimum to repair the front air springs. I located the manufacturer- paid under 200.00 for the NEW set- and paid my friend at the exhaust shop 100.00 to put them on for me.
Tranny shifts effortlessly- GREAT PURR with the Flowmaster dual exhaust and straight pipes. 
Need to pass that slow guy?- lightly press on the accelerator to go around- in an instant.
This car has been from Nashville on trips to Orlando, Manhattan, Louisville, Knoxville, Atlanta and Memphis and has always delivered a smooth, consistent ride. Average MPG on those trips has ALWAYS been between 19.5 and 22.0 per gallon.
However- those long trips- due to the stiff racing inspired seats, can get a little painful. Stop and stretch every now and then.
The Raven black exterior gets a regular coat of Zymol wax and combined with keeping it in the garage and out of the rain has kept that black to a mirror shine.
She is semi-retired now- and only gets driven to work on Fridays or the sunny Saturday outing- but ALWAYS starts, and still turns heads. 
The owner of the Lincoln dealership has even stopped me to admire how clean she is- "would I want to trade"?- he asks. 
LOL- only if he is buying!
