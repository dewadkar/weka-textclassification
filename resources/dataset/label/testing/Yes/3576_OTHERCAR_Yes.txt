            I bought the Canon PowerShot G2 Digital Zoom Camera after trading up from the Kodak DC280. As far as features and settings go, there is no comparison between the two.

The Kodak took great pictures and was much smaller and compact, but did not have the range of features and settings like the Canon. This camera has everything you would need to become a professional photographer if you take the time and effort to learn to use all its features.

If you don't have all that ambition and just want a great digital camera that will give you excellent photos without taking advantage of all its versatility, the Canon is still one of the best cameras you could possibly own. Just use the Auto settings and you will still be producing the highest quality photos than you could with any other camera on the market in this price range.

The camera has a good solid feel to it and it has a very comfortable grip. It is a bit larger than many other cameras but that is something you will easily get used to.
One of its best features is the monitor screen which can be swung, tilted and snapped back in place so it faces outward instead of inward.

The camera comes with a 32MB compact flash card which is more than many cameras provide, but I would recommend adding another higher card like 128MB or 256MB. The prices on these cards are dropping rapidly, so shop around. This is a 4.0 megapixel camera so a larger card will give you many more pictures at the high settings.

Two things that did disappoint me a little were the macro capabilities and the lens cap arrangement. The macro, or close-up, ability does not seem to be as good as what the Kodak DC280 offered. There is a close-up lens available from Canon, but even with this, I seemed to get closer and clearer shots with the DC280 and its close-up attachment.
The other slight disappointment is the lens cap arrangement.
With the Kodak, the lens cap popped off automatically when the camera was turned on to shooting mode. With the Canon, the cap has to be manually removed or the camera will not function. Although the cap can be tethered like the Kodak, it is still a bit of an annoyance until you get used to remembering to remove it before turning on the camera.

The software that comes packed with this camera is top notch. You get the Canon Zoom Browser software and the Adobe PhotoShop 5.0 LE, both of which are fabulous and easy to learn and use. There are so many great features and capabilities to this camera, that there is really no way to attempt to describe them all in this short review. I can only say that if you are in the market for a digital zoom camera in the price range of $700-$800, don't look any further than the Canon PowerShot G2. You might even be able to find it cheaper than that, but be careful where you buy it and make sure it comes with a U.S. warranty. There are many stores and on-line sites that will sell it cheap, but with a non-U.S. warranty and you want to avoid this.

The user's guide that comes with the package is clear and concise, but I would also recommend investing another twenty bucks or so and buy the book by Dennis Curtin: A SHORT COURSE IN CANON POWERSHOT G2 PHOTOGRAPHY. This is a great supplement to the User's Guide that will help you understand the basic and the advanced uses of this fantastic camera.
