            hey i highly recomend this car because i  bought one my self like 2 years ago.  my car is a 1991 acura integra ls.  now it has like 163 thousand miles and its still very fast and reliable.  i bought the car for like 2 thousand dollars and it still last  and haven't broke down on me.  acura integra is made by honda and trust me, i work with a lot of honda and i think acura integra is a very good car to buy.  ok, my car broke down on me before, the timing belt pop  after six  months and i thought there goes  my engine but i put another timing  belt and the car still very fast.  oh  by the way, the new integra motor (90-00) is  the same as  the old motor,  trust me on this, i work with race cars.  hey  this is a good car, fast,  reliable, and fun to drive.<br><br>
