            I had a 1993 Geo Storm for 5 years.  It was good for the first few years, but then I started having a lot of costly problems with it including having to replace the head gasket and a very costly break repair at around $1500. Lucky for me I had an extended warranty and everything was covered (with a 50.00 co-pay each time) but it involved bringing my car into the shop often, sometimes for days at a time.  

Geo Storms are terrible winter starters!  I would have to set my alarm clock so I could go out and start my car every 4 hours when the temperatures dropped under 20 below with a 50 below or more windchill.  You may ask "when does it get that cold???" - Well, every winter in Wisconsin we have at least a week of that....and I was stuck every winter without a ride to work some morning.  

But enough bad stuff, this car is really CUTE and fun to drive.  The stereo sounded great and the seating was comfortable...very sporty with that whole "laying down" feel.  It was reliable in that it never stranded me, although it had it's major problems.  It was a better winter driving car than you might think, and I loved it. It was really hard to part with...I liked it so much.  But I got lucky and found the only car I would give my Geo Storm up for - a Toyota Paseo, which is very similar.  I say I was lucky because by the time my Geo Storm started getting more and more worn out, they had stopped making the Paseo.  I found my dream car used and in mint condition - and finally said goodbye to my Storm.  

I recommend the car, just because I loved mine so much.  But Geo's have their problems...I'd recommend a Toyota over a Geo.
