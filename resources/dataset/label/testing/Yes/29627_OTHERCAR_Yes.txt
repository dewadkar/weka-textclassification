            I have had 6 Nissan Quest's.  With my three children, this mini van is perfect for our family.  We lease our vehicles, and can't imagine going with another mini van.  Other than the usual maintenance, we have never been inconvenienced with having the Quest in for repairs.  In fact, we have never had to have any of the van's in for repairs.  We have driven to Charleston South Carolina three times with a Quest, and myself and the children all ride very comfortably.  My only complaints about the car would be the shelf in the back of the van, I have a hard time managing it and am not quite sure what to do with it, and the cup holders.  I have been reassured by Nissan that the cup holders will be much improved in the 2000 model year.  I highly recommend this vehicle!  In fact, we did recommend this vehicle to my husband's elderly uncle, and he is so happy, he plans on buying a second Quest in 2 or three years.<br><br>
