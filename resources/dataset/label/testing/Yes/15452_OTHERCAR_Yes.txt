             We recently bought the Sony MVC-FD88 about a month ago. And we just love it. It was the best investment that my husband and I have ever made.
I think that anyone would benefit from this product, but mostly that people that have children that you take alot of pictures of, and have love ones far away that you can sent the too. 
 The reason we bought this product was a friend of ours had one and just really liked the quaility that the camera produced.
It is light weight and you can also make mpeg movie on it which is also great for sending online. The regular disk hold approx. 14-16 pictures and the movies can be 20 seconds long. I just totally love it.
