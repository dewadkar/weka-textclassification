            I got a 1998 Integra as a loaner while my Legend was having a major service performed. I had the car for 2 days and I was a little surprised as to why so many people seem to go nuts for this car.  Overall, it's a fine car...BTW it was a 4 door LS loaded with every option except leather seats.  The styling is pretty slick.  No other car looks like an integra.  I really liked the projector beams more for asthetics rather than function.  I found no difference in their performance when compared to standard headlamps with halogen bulbs.  The interior is nicely done, but the dash is very strange.  I don't like how everything stacks on one another and kind of starts poking out at the occupants from the radio up.  The gauges are very nice, but the huge &quot;pod&quot; like instrument cluster seems so strange. Also, the general feel and look of the interior was a little on the cheap side.  I expected more from Acura.  Performance wise, this car is a bit anemic.  The engine does make a nice growl, but doesn't have enough muscle to back it up.  Those of you who think I don't know what I'm talking about because this wasn't a GSR with the VTEC engine.....stop and consider the VTEC to PGM-FI ratio of integras you see on the road.  I think it's safe to say that over 3 out of 5 integras you will see out there are non VTEC.  As far as handling goes, it's perfect!  I didn't think a sedan could ever be so light on it's feet.  To impove this car, Acura should redesign the dash to wrap around the driver while being considerate of the passengers.  The 1991-1995 Toyota MR2 dash and interior is one of the finest in the world.  I suggest Acura lower the seating position in the car and move the dash closer to the front seat occupants.  Also, drop the LS engine!!!!!  Make the 170 horse VTEC engine standard and leave the only option in that area as being the TYPE R.  Overall, I'd reccomend the Integra, but at about $8000 for a 1994 model with high miles, it's priced too high.  About 5-6K sounds more reasonable.     <br><br>
