            It's a Benz
Cons:  The only drawback I can think of is that my model did not come with fog lights and the dealer at the time could not provide them. Three phone calls and a couple of emails to Mercedes Benz of North America remedied the situation.


The ML430 is a classic Mercedes vehicle with German simplicity, combined with muscle and compelling energy. I purchased the ML430 because of the extra energy provided well beyond the ML320.

I wanted to remain with a Benz and waited several years until the SUV arrived. I have driven Benzes for more than 25 years and could not face getting an SUV unless it was a Benz. Guess it is in my blood.

The vehicle is not ostentatious but sports a smart mix of form and function. Power is very very cool. Would not trade it for the world. Though the ML55 sounded most attractive, not sure the extra $25k will get me a good return on investment beyond that of the ML430. 

The only drawback I can think of is that my model did not come with fog lights and the dealer at the time could not provide them. Three phone calls and a couple of emails to Mercedes Benz of North America remedied the situation.

For those of you in California, beware that the built in fog lights are disconnected because the State of California does not allow them because of the height restrictions.

Despite these facts, I love my ML430.....
