            This is know as C-1400XL here in Australia.

I've had this camera for a few months and have been a joy exploring it's shooting abilities.I have always used film based SLR cameras.

It was a top of the line camera from a few years back. And, maybe be a bit obsolete in terms of its resolution. But, I reckon it performs really well and delivers very good pictures compared to the other cameras of the same resolution.

The macro shots I took were great...sharp, vibrant and detailed. The optics which came with this camera is very good, and have been quite pleased with the results I got.  It has spot metering and the synch for the external flash has been quite useful in light filling my subjects when the surroundings are too bright.

The controls are well positioned as well.
One thing I like about this camera is that it doesn't look like a digital camera. It has the feel of a regular autofocus SLR. 

Film based photography can get expensive. With a camera like this, I still get to enjoy my shoots without having to worry about spending for processing and development. I don't have to fuzz about scanning my pics to store it digitally too.

I have little complaints about battery life because I use 1650 mAH NiMh batteries which lets me shoot to my hearts content and not worry about draining the power.
