            <b>There comes a time in every man&#146s life when he is faced with the temptation of satisfying his instincts&#133  of succumbing to his primal urges, no matter what the cost.  No, I&#146m not making a defense for any college coaches out there, nor am I being lewd.  I&#146m talking about the Nissan 350Z&#133  I&#146m talking about how this encounter between man and machine almost separated me from my meager income.</b>


Perhaps I should explain my story.  I&#146ve always liked the Z car, especially the early 90&#146s versions.  Ah, I still fondly remember opening my car magazines to show the 280 ZX and 300ZX turbos in all their glory.  Sadly, Nissan priced the car too high and the Z came to rest after 1996.  Rumors circulated that a new Z would return, but nothing came of it&#133  until now.  And so, as a fourth year medical student about to start his residency (and gain some income for the first time in his life), I thought I&#146d go have a look.  True, it was out of my price range, but it was nothing that a little loan here and a little loan there couldn&#146t handle.  I&#146ve driven this car twice now&#133  and am very glad I did.  I will get into this later.

<b>EXTERIOR:  9</b>
Talk about striking.  With its wide stance reminiscent of a bulldog ready to strike, its bold, muscular styling draws my attention every time I see it, particularly in the dark gray color.  It&#146s perhaps a little too rounded in the back, looking like the &#147J-Lo&#148 of sports cars at some angles, but the two oversized exhaust pipes finish off the muscular idea quite nicely.  

Built on Nissan&#146s FM platform (shared by the Infiniti G35 and others), the engine is located farther back on the front wheel axle, though not completely behind it.  The 350Z is neither a lightweight or a porker:  averaging 3200 pounds, it&#146s of a respectable weight, considering all the standard equipment already thrown into this lovely package.  However, the heaviest 350Z (3320 pounds) weighs more than a &#145Vette.  Respectable too is the 53:47 front-to-rear weight ratio, though I admit I was expecting it to be more even.  No matter:  with a long wheelbase (104.3&#148) and generous wheel tracks, this car promised to be able to handle anything thrown at it.  Upgrade to the Track model, and you&#146ll be able to show off huge Brembo brakes through the larger wheel rims, and a rear spoiler.


<b>INTERIOR:  7</b>
It&#146s a given that in a two seat sports car, some compromises are inevitable.  This was indeed the case.  For starters, take the lack of cargo space.  The two-seat interior has acceptable room for two 6-footers, despite an almost oversized console.  Where&#146s the glove box?  Storage bins are hard to access (<i>behind</i> the seats?!), and the chassis stabilizing bar, while nice to look at, bisects the cargo area, precluding loading and unloading.  The &#147trunk&#148 (area behind the seats) provides you with a meager 6.8 cubic feet of cargo space&#133  enough to fit 2 golf bags, supposedly.  Edmunds.com reports that Nissan offers fitted luggage as well.  That might be a smart buy.

Sitting inside, you&#146ll notice that Nissan went through to great lengths to make the 350Z feel like a true driver&#146s car.  For instance, you&#146ll notice that the driver&#146s seat is shaped differently from the passenger&#146s, with extra thigh cushioning and lateral support.  There's even a chunk of the inside lateral bolster that was removed so as not to interfere with shifting.  You also sit pretty low to the ground...  I felt as if I was sitting in a Camaro/Corvette.  The tilt steering wheel actually moves the <i>entire gauge cluster</i>, not just the steering wheel.  Controls are easily within reach and logically placed so you can keep your eyes on the road.  The sound and climate control controls are large enough that it makes them hard to miss.  Speaking of climate control, it works very efficiently&#133  it was a hot day in San Antonio, yet the automatic climate control performed admirably.  The standard 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system is decent enough, though I was expecting it to be as kick-buttocks as the rest of the car was turning out to be.  As always, a tape deck is a nice thing to have (for audio books and such), but it's not available here.  Upgrade to the Touring model, and you can opt for a more powerful system, as well as leather seats.

Unfortunately, one feature that cannot be had on the Z is a sunroof.  That's logical enough, as headroom would be even tighter in there.


<b>ENGINE:  9</b>
I&#146ve driven few cars in the recent past that actually <i>feel</i> as fast as they advertise.  The 350Z is definitely one of them.  No sooner had I stomped the throttle, I was pinned in my seat, startled at how much power there was on tap.  Using Nissan&#146s award-winning 3.5L V6, the valve lift was increased and the intake ports were redesigned to produce a hefty 287 horsepower at 6200rpm and 274 lb-feet of torque at 4800 rpm.  The beauty of the relatively low-end torque was that not much shifting was required to get the acceleration that was needed.  The Z has plentiful power across the power band, though it&#146s most noticeable from a stop.  Truly a joy to drive&#133

&#133 And yet&#133  and yet&#133  a chore at times.  You see, even though the manual shifter is sure and precise, there is so much power is on tap that using the manual takes some getting used to.  The gas pedal needs only a soft touch when you come off the clutch to get the car going.  Anything more than that, and you&#146re sent lurching forward as if you&#146re in a big hurry.  I hadn&#146t noticed this so much during my first drive because I mainly drove on the highway, and there&#146s still plenty of power in sixth gear to scoot.  My second drive consisted mostly of city driving, which better exposed this little flaw.  I finally got used to it, but I&#146m not sure I liked it.  Oh yeah, and don&#146t forget to use Premium gas on this baby (good thing gas mileage is decent).

But then again, who&#146s to complain when driving a $30,000 Porsche?

Although I drove the manual, a sequential-sport shift automatic is of course available.  According to my sources, the &#147manual mode&#148 is indeed the real thing:  even when hitting the redline, the transmission will not shift for you until you select the higher gear.


<b>HANDLING:  9</b>
Easily one of this car&#146s strongest suits, the 350Z was a hoot to toss around.  You can really feel how stiff the body structure is when engaging the twisties.  Similarly impressive was the short braking distances, almost into exotic car territory, by some accounts, made even easier with its effective brake assist feature.   Power steering is very quick, though not necessarily darty, and feedback is adequate.  Other Epinions members have stated the car is easy to drive fast, and I agree.

The Z has unfortunately become notorious for front-end plowing into hard turns.  I&#146ll defer to the experts on that one, though I noticed nothing of the sort during pretty spirited driving.  (What I wouldn&#146t give for a track when I drive these things!)  Having said that, I was expecting better balance.  While there is no body roll and the Z stays composed, you don&#146t necessarily feel the balance and &#147tossability&#148 that you&#146d find on, say, a Mazda Miata or Toyota MR2.  Perhaps a comparison shouldn&#146t be drawn between these cars, as the latter two can&#146t match the Z&#146s muscle.  


<b>RIDE:  7</b>
True, I was expecting the Z to be stiffly sprung.  And in most instances, I was reminded of how solidly built this car was.  Plus, wind noise is pleasantly hushed.  However, the ride gets jittery on uneven pavement, and downright tiring after driving imperfect roads for an extended period of time.  The engine note can be quite sonorous during heavy acceleration, but isn&#146t even all that satisfying.   It&#146s true that it&#146s only a V6 engine, so I shouldn&#146t expect much...

I forgot to mention that there are very few creature comforts for the driver in these driving situations.  For example, there is no true armrest.  In fact, the seats are so low, it's uncomfortable to rest your elbow on the window sill.  Oh, the prices we pay for fun.


<b>RELIABILITY:  ???</b>
As I&#146ve mentioned a couple of times, the 350Z felt very solid on both occasions with no rattles or noticeable flaws in build quality.  Some interior materials, such as the plastic cover for the center console, felt a little flimsy, but overall I&#146d say things in the Z should hold up nicely over the years.  No recalls have been issued for the 350Z so far, but in case you want updates, I suggest you check this website periodically: http://www.autoweb.com/recalls/default.htm?uMid=16&uS=Research

Nissan has done a pretty good job at building cars that require little if any unscheduled maintenance.  The 350Z should be no different, though it is in its introductory year, which deserves a little cautioning.


<b>VALUE:  9</b>
Where else can you find a car that will take you from 0-60 in 5.4 seconds for under $28,000?  Sure, you could opt for the smaller and less powerful Miatas, MR2&#146s, or even WRX&#146s but for anything close to this kind of power, your next option would be a Vette, priced well into the 40&#146s.  
All trims of the Z come with that sweet 287hp engine.  Even the base trim 350Z has the following standard items:  automatic climate control, a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD sound system,  power windows, locks, and mirrors.  Even the most tricked out Track model (that&#146s a tongue twister for ya!) tops out around $31,000&#133  that&#146s still $9K less than a Mercedes SLK and $12K less than a Porsche Boxster.  All indications so far predict that resale value will be excellent.

The only problem here is that dealers know what a steal they have on their hands, and they&#146re not likely to dicker down very much.  Nissan is keeping production of the Z under control so as not to flood their dealers, too.  Of course, demand is pretty high.


<b>THE VERDICT:  THE Z LIIIIIIIIIIVZ!</b>
So there I was, driving up to the dealer&#146s parking lot, white-knuckled and heart pounding.  A wonderful car for a fun drive.  &#133 But to own?  After my second drive this all became too apparent.  Lack of cargo space, a touchy shifter, and a sometimes intrusive ride (even by sports car standards) made me ponder it long enough to decide against breaking the piggy bank.

Oh, but don&#146t let me sound like I&#146m coming down on Nissan&#146s new poster child for performance.  It gets solid 4 stars from me...  Income, or lack thereof, was the real culprit here, although some inhospitable aspects of the Z sealed my decision.  Had that not been the case, I probably would have taken the plunge.  At risk of sounding repetitive, I must say that this driving experience reminded me of a drive I took in a Porsche several years ago...  no other car for this low a price will give you that.  Who knows?  Maybe in a few years.

<b>AVERAGE SCORE FOR THE 350Z:  8.33 out of 10
