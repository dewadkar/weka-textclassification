                  Unlike 90% of SUV owners I take my Pathfinder off-road, a lot.  Not to say that I take it on the Rubicon or anything, but living in Maine and having to get around to campsites and the like in snow, mud, ice, etc, has provided me with an adequate understanding of the Pathfinder's abilities.  

      I only have the base model XE with all the power options so I can't comment on the dual setting suspension system however the stock suspension seems to me like a near perfect blend of on road comfort and off road ability.  I'm not saying its up there with the Mercedes M Class or the new BMW X5, but in it's class I'd say its a leader.

      The engine could use more power and the wind noise is a little loud but aside from a broken CD player (covered by the warranty) I've had no mechanical problems at all.  I love the 2000 models redesigned front end and have recently test driven one and found the level of refinement to me leaps and bounds above my 96!  Considering it's up for a total makeover next year I think I'm going to have to start saving up for my next one.  You can't beat Nissan build quality.       <br><br>
