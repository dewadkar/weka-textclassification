            We purchased the 1999 Chrysler Concorde LX after an exhaustive search for a new car.  I was embarking on a new career in real estate and wanted a vehicle that could haul people around comfortably--and I got it!

I love this car for it's comfort and roominess.  I always joke that you can hide several bodies in the trunk! LOL

The interior is equipped with power seats, mirrors, door locks and windows.  The seats are comfortable and the backseat has tons of room for tall people.  The overhead console has settings with compass/temp, distance until empty, average fuel economy, trip odometer, etc.  You can program it to open your garage door or set the alarm on your house.  I'm addicted to it!  I also can't live with out the keyless entry.  The stereo has a CD player (no cassette, which I miss sometimes for books on tape) that has great sound quality even over the slighlty noisy ride.

The exterior is stylish and sleek.

This car seemed to be in the same class as an Accord, Camry, Taurus, etc, but for us it looked like a much more expensive car and had all the bells and whistles.

We've been really happy with it so far but have experienced some difficulty with the power windows.  At one point or another all four power windows have stopped working and we've had it in to the dealer 3 times before they replaced all 4 window regulators.  The problem seems to be resolved, but I still have an uneasy feeling about those windows.

I am also noticing that my interior lights will flash on at strange times and for no reason.  We have not had this looked at because we can't predict when it will happen.  Minor glitch or early warning of major electrical problems.

Overall, we've been really happy with our Concorde and would recommend it to anyone.
