            I love my car.  I have had it for one year now and have not had one single problem with it, not even a rattle!!!  It handles like a dream.  I can take a corner at 35 mph and not even feel any body roll, the tires won't squeal, and it hugs the corner tight.  Everything is easily accessible in the car also.  I can reach the radio, heater controls, trunk and gas tank release all without stretching.  This car is the perfect size for parking, zipping in and out of traffic, and best of all it is great on gas.  I can get about 350 miles out of a tank of gas, and that is all stop and go traffic. I can't say enough about this car.  I would definitely buy another if I could afford it!!<br><br>
