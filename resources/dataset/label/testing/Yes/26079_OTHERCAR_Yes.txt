            I think the Mazda Protege is one of the most outstanding cars out here on the roads. I just purchased one last June. One thing that I can say, that it is a very reliable car. It's excellent on gas and maintenance. I would like to see Mazda make this car out to be a sedan. I would be sure to purchase another one.  If you are thinking about purchasing a car in the next few months, be sure to think of the Mazda Protege. I believe deep in my heart that it is a winner.  I have referred the Protege to several of my friends. I have had a few that have actually went an test drove the car. We all sit and talk about how the body shape has improve. It much more roomier than the old one. It has this air about it, that make you think, is that really a Protege. I feel in love when I first brought it. This is my first car, and I wouldn't give it up for anything else. If I were to buy another car, I would keep my protege and just have two cars.

To all of the people who are considering buying a new car for the first time, think of Mazda's Protege.
