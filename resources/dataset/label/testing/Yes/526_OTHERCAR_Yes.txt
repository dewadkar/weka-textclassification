            I bought this UZ-2100 last Winter for my vacation. Before I made the purchase I had done a lot of research and comparison as this is not a cheap investment! I paid $699 + $100 accessories. I compared the picture quality of this model against other very popular digital cameras--Nikon (950,880 etc.). Olympus beats Nikon this time. The light
and color that Olympus presents is significantly better than Nikon. Any the 10x optical zoom leaves Nikon further behind. If you want to take pictures of your kid's soccer game or the singing birds on your roof or the ship far away on the ocean...you will love the ultra zoom. As for the mega-pixel, you really don't need anything more than 2.1. Do you really want picture of size more than 10M that can crash your PC and has much more resolution than your monitor or printer? The "3rd level" picture this camera produces (about 400k in jpg format) is GOOD enough for printing and viewing on the PC. I haven't even tried to 
take the highest resolution photo, which is about 10m in tiff format. So the optical quality (lens, zoom etc.) is more important than the high mega-pixel. I took the best pictures in my life last Winter in Florida. Yes, it is expensive, but worth every penny!
