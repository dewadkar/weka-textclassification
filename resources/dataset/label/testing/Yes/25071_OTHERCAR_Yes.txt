            This is currently Kodak's high end consumer camera.  Although you can get higher MP in the professional lines, this is probably the only one you'll need for your home photography.

I purchased this camera at Futureshop for $500 USD ($750 cdn.)  after a mail in rebate.  I wanted something with 3.1 mp for future use but to be perfectly honest, this is probably overkill for your regular 3x5/4x6 photos that you will be developing.

This camera is amazing at getting daytime photo shots and comes with one of the best packages/options available.  It comes with a 16 mb compactflash card but the first thing that I ended up getting was a 48 mb card.  This is a well built, solid camera that comes with a lot of accessories for the price range.

You'll probably need 64 mb (= 64 high res pictures/ compressed) for most daily uses.  The second thing that I would recommend is getting an extra battery as the LCD screen turns off when you reach about 50% battery life.  It allows you to continue shooting but you won't have the advantage of immediate feedback.

The achilles heel of this camera (and other digital cameras as well) is low light/ nighttime flash photography.  The built in flash is not quite strong enough to throw a typical 6' range.  In addition, it has trouble getting clear edges in low light so nightime action shots are definitely out.

Still, I've taken over 750 shots over the last 3 months and have no regrets.  Buying this as an introductory camera to digital photography will allow you to use these pictures in the future (when you're nostalgic, and looking back) when technology has progressed.

I also considered the Nikon 880 (recommended - costs $200 usd more for comparable package) and the canon S20 at the time but they were both more expensive.

Final note - now that the rebate offer is over, the reasons for getting this camera (compared to a Nikon 880) are less compelling.  I suspect that they will release a new model in the near future with improved features and you may wish to wait until then.
