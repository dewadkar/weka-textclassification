            I realize that when most people see the title of my opinion "Geo Metro my best car" they probably laugh and figure that I haven't had many good cars. They would be wrong. I currently own a 2000 Cadillac Escalade, a 1999 Dodge Durango, a 1993 Mercedes Benz 300 SL Roadster, and my favorite, my yellow 1991 Geo Metro LSI convertible. I bought my Geo Metro in 1996 at a car auction for $1500. I commute 160 miles every day to work and I needed something that was good on gas. The $1500 was the best investment I have ever made. I choose to drive my Geo over my other cars for several reasons. It gets great gas mileage. I have a standard shift (the only way to go with these cars) and I get about 45 mpg. I have 192,000 miles on it and it has been inexpensive to maintain. I did have to put a new transmission in it 2 months ago. The total cost was $275. Anybody who knows about cars knows that is dirt cheap. You can get four brand new tires for about $99. The car is also safer than most people give it credit for. I was rear ended in an accident. My car was sent forward about 50 feet. When I got out of my car I expected the rear end to be totally smashed in. There was only an imprint of the other car's license plate on my bumper. I found out later that the Geo has a triple bumper design to help it withstand a rear end collision. There is also an airbag. The only things I don't like is that the headrest is too short and sometimes it can get a little noisy on the freeway. A loud stereo helps solve the latter problem. It actually has more leg room than my Mercedes and I'm no shrimp (6'2"). I have been made fun of by some of my associates. They call my car "banana" or "Old Yeller".They tell the usually windup car jokes. I usually get the last laugh when they mention that it cost them $35-$50 to fill up there big SUV or luxury car while it only cost me between $9-$14. I know a lot of people wouldn't be caught dead driving a "Geo". It's not exactly an ego booster. When my ego gets bruised too bad I simply drive one of my other cars. I also tell my friend that the Geo is the reason I can afford all those other cars. Since the car has saved me so much money over the years I recently decided to spruce it up. When I first purchased it from the auction the paint was all faded and there were several dents. I decided to give it a whole new makeover. There are so many accessories out there that I wasn't even aware of. I never knew you could make a Geo Metro look so sporty. It looks brand new now. Most people I come across ask me if Geo has put out a 2001 model. I have gotten several offers for what I have now dubbed the "G-C-1" edition. Before the makeover my wife wouldn't drive the car and my daughter didn't want to be seen in it, that is no longer the case. If you would like to see some before and after pictures and get a complete rundown of what I did to my car feel free to E-mail me at GChambers0183@aol.com. I plan to keep my 1991 Geo Metro LSI Convertible forever.
