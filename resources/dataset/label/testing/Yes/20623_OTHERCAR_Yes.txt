            This car is great!  It is so fun to drive and my radio is fantastic (I am in sales, and count on a great radio for a pick-me-up). That upgrade was very worth it! The interior is great, and I love the red dash!  The turning ratio is great, and I find I am often making u-turns when going to appointments, etc-no curbs for me!  It is very responsive, and I have had virtually stress-free winter driving with the 4 wheel drive quattro.  Great Pick up.  The service covers everything (even oil changes) for the first 50,000 miles, and I have loved the service department.

Cons:  The cupholders are not only too small, but placed in a very bad location.  Directly above the radio console!  1 quick stop, and your soda will go all over the radio and heat buttons (personal experience speaks).  Also, could have better compartments for all the loose stuff in your car (CD's, sunglasses, change, pens, business cards, etc.)

I was considering a Volvo for my next vehicle, but the service on this car is so great, why mess with a good thing?
