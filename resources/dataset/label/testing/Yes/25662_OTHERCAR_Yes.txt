            Saw the Vivitar at SAM's for $130.00 and decided I could not go wrong. The Camera has alot of features for a $160 and under digital camera. 4 flash modes, 6 resolutions, 2X zoom (only in 1600X1200 resolution), 3 focus modes,5 white balance, LCD clear screen, 10 Second timer. Only have used super fine1600X1200 setting. 128meg flash card gets 177 photos. Takes good pictures, Easy to use. Photosuite 4 included, hooks to PC easy and opens pictures as soon as camera is connected. Batteries don't last long. I tested the strength using all the features, took about 20 pic's viewed them on the LCD, used the LCD viewer while taking pic's, played them back, used the slide show on the viewer, and hooked it up to PC. Batteries lasted about 2 1/2 hours under these conditions. Noticed the most drain while hooked to the PC. Camera has an auto shut off that does not work when connected to PC.  
Changing batteries resets settings. Using the quick viewer LCD and not using play back function I took about 50 photo's and lost about 1/3 of charge. Connected to the PC for about 20 minutes and lost another 1/3 of the power. Have yet to find the optional AC adapter for the camera which would help when copying onto PC. LCD features are great but kill the 4 AA batteries.
