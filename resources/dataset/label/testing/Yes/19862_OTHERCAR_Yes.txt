            When my husband wanted to get a Chevy truck, I figured it was a &quot;guy thing&quot;.  I thought it would be a useless toy for him.  Boy was I wrong.  First off, the ride is fairly comfortable, so it serves as a reliable means of transportation.  In addition, it is pretty fun to ride in.  The bucket seats are roomy and comfortable.  This truck has an incredible turn radius and handles really well.   It gets pretty good gas mileage, about 20 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway.  We did not get the extended cab, as we did not want the additional room up front.  The truck is solid and reliable, however, it is a little bit weak on uphill climbs.  We have had no mechanical problems, but it is only one and half years old.

Lastly, I vastly underestimated the amount of schlepping one does in the course of life.  Not to mention our move.  And trips to the storage unit.  And those major bargains from garage sales!

The BEST part of the truck is that we were able to save thousands of dollars by using our GM credit card. (Love that GM Mastercard!)
