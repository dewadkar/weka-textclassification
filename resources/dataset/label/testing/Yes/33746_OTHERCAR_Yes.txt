            My last two cars have been Nissan Maxima�s both bought used.  My first was a 1990 white Maxima with tan a interior and automatic transmission.  It had some 50,000 miles on it when I bought it and survive the harsh Hawaiian salt air and the trip over to the mainland quite well.  My ex-wife got it in the settlement.  

So when I needed a new car, I sought out the Nissan Maxima again; this time a 1995 Emerald Green GXE with a 3.8 liter DOHC V-6 engine, leather interior, manual transmission, moon roof, A/C, power everything, and a CD player.  I bought it at CarMax and I love this car!  It handles like a dream, is fast off the line, shifts smoothly, accelerates quickly�which is great at highway speeds where acceleration is essential, brakes on a dime with little fade, and is easy on the wallet, especially on the highway where I can go almost 425 miles between fill ups. The seats are comfortable but on long trips I can experience some lower back strain.  The ride at highway speeds is smooth, and  the car remains responsive, and the engine has enough torque even at the higher ranges to make acceleration a non-issue.  

The sound system, made by Bose, which includes six speakers, is fantastic.  The stereo has controls for bass, treble, balance, and fade, and are easy to operate.  All the controls, including those for temperature, are within easy reach of the driver and have a balanced feel to them as well.   The button for the cruise control (C/C) are on the steering wheel, which is great for me, because I activate the C/C as soon as I hit the highway and get up to speed.  I then govern my speed while driving via the C/C utilizing the buttons to speed up or slow down as needed.

The only problem I have had with the car is a faulty fuel injector, which was replaced to the tune of some $500.00; ouch!  But, like I stated at the outset, I love my Maxima and will probably keep it for another year or two before trading it in on something equally as nice, and of course as fast and fun to drive.
