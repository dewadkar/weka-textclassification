            I bought a refurbished Kodak DC-200 camera from Kodak's website nearly 3 years ago.  Now, more than 5,000 pictures later, it is still going strong!  I paid (Summer 1998) about $400 for this camera and I have yet to find another that I would trade it in for.  While prices have dropped dramatically (let me tell you what I paid for my scanner...ha ha) I just don't think you can beat the value and quality of a Kodak.  

I honestly haven't missed not having a zoom--I could have gotten a DC-210 for $100 more, but as a poor college student at the time, I figured that could wait til I upgraded.  As other epinions will tell you, yes, you can use a lot of batteries with this camera.  Luckily, my wonderful sister and brother bought me 8-AA Nickle Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries and a charger from Radio Shack that year for Christmas.  These batteries are great (I'll rate them a 10 as well!) and I get about 2-3 full runs of pictures with them before they need to be recharged (about 5 hours to recharge--I plug it in before I go to bed, very convenient.)  

If I were to use the AC adapter when unloading, the batteries would last much longer.  Also, I never use the &quot;preview&quot; screen when taking pics as this seems to drain the batteries much more quickly.  I find it's easier to trash a picture immediately after taking it if it's not a good one than to try to use the &quot;preview&quot; feature (hey, all my pictures are good...) and so my batteries last longer.

I keep the camera set at the middle setting (38 pictures on a 4-MB picture card) and the resolution is great, the color is true-to-life, the contrast is perfect (not too dark or yellow like some cameras).  I've honestly been so satisfied with the batteries I use that I never even bothered to buy the AC adapter--though I notice it comes standard now with some of the packages available at www.kodak.com.  I thought I'd like a larger picture card, but I haven't yet had the need to upgrade the 4-MB that came with the camera.  If I were to go on a long vacation I would probably upgrade to more memory, but the camera works well with the laptop I used so I haven't yet.  

Also, great follow-up and customer service from the Kodak website guys.  I had a little cheapie 35 mm camera from Kodak and the living hinge on the viewfinder broke, so I emailed asking to buy a replacement and they offered to send me a whole new camera for free!  And, last fall I received an email from Kodak asking if I wanted to trade in my camera for a $250 credit towards any camera on their website.  A smart person would have taken them up on that offer, but I've had such great luck with my DC-200 that I don't see a need to upgrade just yet!
