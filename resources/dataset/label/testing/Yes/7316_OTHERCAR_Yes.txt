            I received this digital camera for my birthday.  At first, looking at it, it seemed very daunting!  I mean you had software, cords, and instructional manual that's an 1/2 inch thick!!  I'm like..."Yeah right!  I'm going to figure this out?"  Well, I did figure it out and it's so easy to use!!

<b>The Body<b>

It looks just like any other point and shoot camera that they sell out there on the market.  It has the lens cover, the flash area, the shutter release button at the top, etc.  Just think camera!  When you turn the camera over is where the likenesses stop.  The back has your on/off switch, your digital screen to preview your pictures, a menu button, buttons where you can lock your pictures in, etc.

<b>Use of Camera<b>

You can either use the camera as a point and shoot (which cuts down on bouncy pictures, and produces a more steady photo, also can autofocus), or you can use it by locating your picture on the digital screen and taking your photos that way.

<b>Reviewing and downloading your photos<b>
You can either view the pictures on your television, (with the cords that are supplied and is difficult for this novice to figure out!!  LOL), on the camera itself, or you can hook the camera to your computer and preview and download that way.  Personally, also as a gift I received the Microtech Smartmedia Card Reader/Writer by ZIO!  It made viewing the picture so much easier and you are not wasting your batteries by use this device.

<b>In conclusion<b>
I feel that I am going to have a lot of fun with this camera and I have a lot to explore.  This review was primarily written on a first hand experience of opening the package and learning.  There is still so much to learn about this camera and I hope to come back often and update this review.  So if you are a digi camera beginner, I hope that this review gets you going the right way.  And please check back often as I learn more about my new camera!!
