            Hi,
My mom and dad bought a 1993 Plymouth Acclaim with a 2.5L four cylinder in it back when I was little.  We had traded in a Chrysler station wagon because it was falling apart all over the place.  My dad said that he had owned a few Chrysler's in his time and each one that he bought would be better than the last one.  Well, he thinks buying the Acclaim was one of the best decisions he has ever made.
The little four cylinder has incredible power that delivers when you need it to.  The sound of the engine being floored is one of the best sounds that I have ever heard.  I can still pull into traffic with absolutely now worries at all.  The power is the same as when it was new.
The car now has 232,000 miles on it and it has never had any major problems.  We drove it back and forth across the states for years and it never shut down on us.  The quality is unbelievable.  My entire family loves this car and it will probably stay in the family for years to come.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  Many people at my school drive them.  I would also have to say that mine is probably the best looking out of all of them even though no other car has the mileage that it does in the parking lot.  The other people that own the Acclaims at my school have beat the @%#$ out of them and they still start up and run like new.  I love this car.
