               This car is great for the price. The new MR-2 looks something like a warped porsche boxer. This car retails around $23,500.00, and for that price you get apretty well rounded package. This car has only 135 horsepower but it's weight to power ratio is so low it doesn't really matter. 
   The MR-2 is also a blast to drive, the seats hold you in and the atmosphere is almost like a porsche, but with better seats. 
   Some problems i noticed from the car is that it's only a 5-speed, and slower then the celica gt-s. The interior is also less superior in comfort and style to the celica's in my opinion. The celica is flush in appearence, and adds that 6-speed shifter. The MR-2 on the otherhand has a awkward, waste of space between the center console and the dash. One other peeve was that there is no trunk, it's engine in the back and a spare tire well in the front. 
   There are some good points also, this car has a passanger airbag turn off switch, which is very important if there are young kids in the seat. The guages are also white faced and alalog not like the digital displays of Honda's S2000. The steering is powerful and predictable, the clutch makes shifting a rush, and the car is just a blast to own.
   Right now, i think the engine needs more tuning and i hope that they will make a turbo version, like they did with the 2nd gen MR2's and hopefully they'll also come with a 6 speed gearbox.
  If you can't wait for engine upgrades the japanese aftermarket has already adopted the spyder and i'm hope that these parts will soon come to the states. i've already heard that they have tuned these cars to 250+ horsepower.
  Well i hope this has helped you, and i personally would recommend this car to anyone looking for a porsche boxer, bmw z3, or a honda S2000.
