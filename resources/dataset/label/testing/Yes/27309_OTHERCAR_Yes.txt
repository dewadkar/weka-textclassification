            This midsize sport utility is the largest and best in its class. It's comfortable, has plenty of room for cargo and passengers, is quiet, and has great handling.  This vehicle comes with a v-6 or v-8. If you want the power and acceleration this SUV was meant to dish out than the v-8 is a must.  The only SUV that is comparable is the Toyota 4-runner which runs slightly more costly.  The only drawback I have found is that it goes through gas like there is no tomorrow.  Still, if you want a large vehicle that will handle well in rugged conditions yet don't want to get into the more expensive full size sport utilities this is the car to buy.<br><br>
