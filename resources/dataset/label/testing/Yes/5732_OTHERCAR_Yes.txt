            My family have owned many cars for years. My dad has a hobby of working on cars; buying cars that need repair. My dad saw a car that they had at a used car lot a 1992 2.5 liter Plymouth Acclaim white with red interior. The car was in fairly good shape but had engine problems; it had a blown head gasket. My dad decided to purchase it (it was being sold for $600.00) and made arrangements to bring it home. My dad repaired the engine and vacuumed out the interior. He drove it around a bit and asked if I could use the car because I needed some reliable transportation. My dad agreed and gave to me as an extended loan. I took the car home and did some extensive cleaning inside and replaced the muffler. that was 4 years ago and I have since put over 70,000 miles on the car. The odometer has over 177,000 miles on it and the engine is still going strong. Here is how I have rated it:

Interior: has some good leg room, seats are comfortable; and they seem to clean up very nice.

Equipment: My model was a very basic one with cruise control and A/C. The A/C uses the old R12 system that is expensive to refill but I was lucky that the R12 was still in the system and it works great!!

Power: 2.5 liter with a 3 speed transmission; for the most part the performance is ok. the engine tends to chatter a bit from the cam shaft and valves (sounds like a diesel).

reliability: Excellent!! This car is my work horse; If you keep the oil changed every 3,000 miles and change the transmission oil every 10,000 miles you should not have any problems
