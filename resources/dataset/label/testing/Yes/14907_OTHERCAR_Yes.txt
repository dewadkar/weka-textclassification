            My journey through the world of digital photography began one day when I decided to purchase a digital camera. 
With so many options in both features and price, I must admitt that at first, I was quite intimidated by the whole experience.  

You can buy digital cameras dirt cheap, or empty your wallet of thousands of dollars.  I decided that I wanted something of pretty decent picture quality, not an el cheapo from k-mart, yet.. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars because after all, I'm just a poor college kid.

After shopping around I finally decided on my Sony Mavica camera and heres why:

<b>Overall quality:</b>  The camera feels very solid in my hands, has a very nice styling to it which makes it less of a burden to hold, and does not weigh too little nor too much.

<b>Ease of use:</b>  Every feature on this camera is very easy to learn and apply.  The effort involved in learning how to use this camera is not even as difficult as some traditional cameras that I have seen.

<b>Picture quality:</b>  Trust me on this, the pictures look good!!  Crisp, clear,..not grainy or blurry at all.  Unless you have the need for extremely high resolution pictures,..this camera will do you justice.

<b>Zoom:</b>  The 10x optical zooms in and out on the LCD display on the camera (in color)..just as if you were looking on a camcorder.  My experience has shown that the 10x zoom, is really more then I need.  It gives me the perfect amount of flexibility in where I take a picture from.  Unless you have the need for zooming in VERY close, to objects VERY far away (such as spying on neighbors)..then this camera will work fine.

<b>Flash:</b>  The flash on this camera is extremely bright, it literally lights up the entire room like daylight.  The only problem that I have found that is, if its too dark in the room, when the flash goes off..the camera then *see's* objects it couldnt in the dark, and takes the picture before the camera has adequate time to focus correctly on this *new object it see's*.  However, you can solve this problem by adding more light.

<b>Battery:</b>  The battery is a breeze to slip into its charger, and a light tells you when it is charged again.  Battery life in the camera is about 2 1/2 hours.  I have also found that the battery does not lose much of its power during times when its sitting around for weeks on end without use.    

<b>Photo Storage:</b>  Unlike probably 95% of the other cameras out there, this camera uses a standard 3 1/2" floppy disk for memory storage.  However, I would NOT consider this a downfall because.. a disk can hold about 30 pictures - which is all I need.  Disks can be taken out of camera and easy slapped into any computer any time.  Also disks are easy to come by, and very cheap, so instead of loading the pics off of a memory card, you can simply take out u'r disk ..throw it in your pile of disks and grab a new one, and your ready to go.

<b>Other:</b>  This camera also comes with a very sharp looking carrying/neck strap which I find is great. In case the camera should slip out of my hands - or I need my hands for other things..the strap is there.

In conclusion, I'm very pleased with this camera, Its fun to use, meets my demands ..and has paid for itself in terms of no longer needing to pay for film and processing.
