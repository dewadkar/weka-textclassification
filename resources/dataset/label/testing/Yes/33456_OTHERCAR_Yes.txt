            A few months ago I bought a D-510 for my wife, who's a schoolteacher. She wanted something decent to use for her classroom, and that would interface via USB with her iBook. Well, I began to covet her camera after seeing the first few shots, but I figured that when I broke down and finally bought my first digital, I'd want more megapixels. 

However, since I already have a Nikon F3 for the more serious work, I really just wanted a do-it-all, go-anywhere, digital point-n-shoot, and 2 megapixels is plenty. 

Anyway, I get ready to buy another D-510 -- after all, I also bought my wife a battery charger, a 64MB card, and a 128MB card, and wanted to be able to share -- only to learn that Olympus has moved on to smaller and better things: the D-520.

It's smaller, but it isn't *too* small. It's also slightly lighter, and it takes just two AA batteries instead of four (as in the D-510), which makes it a lot easier to carry spares in a little camera bag (more on the bag later). With all the talk about the poor battery life, I half-expected them to run dead after the first few shots, but they are still going strong after about 60 shots, which isn't much, I know, but I'm not complaining.

The other major improvement with the D-520 is that it comes with a 16MB card instead of an 8MB. Since I'm mainly interested in shooting stuff to share via e-mail and the web, I doubt I'll ever need more than 16MB on a single outing. 

I said I wanted a go-anywhere, do-anything camera, and what that means to me is that it's got a decent macro mode all the way to a decent short telephoto mode. You need to use the viewscreen to properly frame your subjects in macro mode, but the little viewfinder works fine for regular shooting. Using the viewfinder is not only easier, but it uses less juice from your batteries.

Another nice thing about this camera is the fill-flash. With the regular auto setting, it has been doing pretty darn well, even with somewhat backlit subjects. It doesn't overdo it, and I don't have to give it a thought.

Finally, as for the camera bag. After I saw the one I bought my wife (came with the "Executive Kit"), I knew I didn't want one for myself. It's on the bulky side, and I don't think there are any compartments for extra batteries. There's a company called Eagle Creek that makes beaucoup sizes of bags, and they have a real small one that's perfect for a point-n-shoot. It's got the main pocket, a front pocket (for batteries), a zippered pocket (for a spare Smartmedia card or whatever, and you can carry it with a shoulder strap or on your belt, or on your backpack's chest strap. I sewed a small denim pocket inside mine that holds my Swiss Army Knife, and I keep a cigarette lighter and a $20 bill in the zipper pouch -- so I've got me a mini-survival kit and a camera to record my survival adventure -- all in one. ;)

All in all, it seems like a pretty nice camera for $243.95 (including shipping, bought from Buydig.com).
