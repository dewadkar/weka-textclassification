            I didn't want to spend more than $250 on a digital camera, so this 2.14 megapixel Toshiba was definitely out of range, until I found a brand new one on Ebay for $270. 

It's probably the best picture quality you can get for that price if you use the 1600x1200 resolution. The picture quality at 800x600 is actually very bad. I suggest shooting at 1600x1200 and using the highest compression mode. 

Another weak point is the battery life. Batteries let you shoot about 40 pics and then die. On the other hand: you can recharge the battery inside the camera, which is why I chose this camera over the Olympus D-340R and D-360L. 

If you can get one for under $300 I suggest you buy it, as the comprehensive features and clear picture quality make this a brilliant camera. To find the cheapest place to find this camera I suggest you check out this website:
