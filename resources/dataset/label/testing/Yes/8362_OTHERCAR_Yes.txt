            If you are looking for a fun car to drive, then this one is it.  I always wanted a sports car, but never wanted to pay $50,000 to have one.  The choices in the less expensive category are minimal.  So, I researched and decided on the Firebird based upon the positive reviews and price.  I was not disappointed.

I purchased a 1997 Pontiac Firebird with the v6 option.  My reason for the v6 is due to insurance cost and gas mileage.  I have been getting around 20 miles per gallon in the city and as much as 28 mpg on the highway.  While the six does not have the horsepower the v8 does, it can still really pull.  For those of you with a heavy foot, easy does it.  This car has great acceleration and performs very well at higher speeds. 

Unlike some sports cars I have driven, the suspension is not super stiff.  While not like that of a luxury car, the ride is relatively smooth for a sports car.  The handling is like that of a race car with the instant response of the steering.  Very minimal movement of the steering wheel is need to get a response from the car.  There is not a lot of engine noise like some sports cars.  

The T-tops are a great add-on for those wonderful summer days when you can just cruise for fun.  The bucket seats are very comfortable and cradle your body as you can easily see the gauges and displays on the dash.  I love the layout of this car's interior!  The stereos in Firebirds are great!  Which is why I did not have to upgrade the stereo at all, nice clean sound and will go as loud as I can stand it without distorting.  Other benefits: ABS, rear defrost, power seats, and driver and passenger air bags.  

As with all rear wheel drive cars (this is one of the last of the breed), taking off from a stop on wet and snow covered pavement can be tricky.  I usually spin the tires on snow covered surfaces with this car easier than most.  My Firebird has a traction control option that limits the loss of traction most of the time.  

The one thing that I dislike the most is the large &quot;blind spot&quot; due to the design of the rear hatch back.  Since there is a long slope to the hatch, the metal connecting the roof and the rear quarter panels is rather wide.  I must really check my blind spots before changing lanes due to this problem.  In the 50k miles I put on this car I have had only two problems:  (1) I had an electrical problem early on with the headlights and (2) I had to replace the alternator.  Otherwise, this car has been very reliable.

I highly recommend this car if you are looking for driving fun.      <br><br>
