            This is my very first car and as such it performs well to my standards. Driving it while in the rain and on snow it does well. Major factors for me however are the facts that it is just not as large as a van. Which scares me because getting into an accident is not something that falls within my goals. However, with all of the major league bad drivers here in Maine it is a lesson in anger when management when someone tries to force me a little bit. That forcing can lead to major dangers and it is the major down fall of this automobile. Despite, having great features, CD player, automatic seat belts, and great steering the issues are not being able to take a crash. Inside of Maine there are good drivers and bad drivers. To, stumble onto a personal story while out driving to a friends house I stopped at a four way. Letting those who had stopped before me go, I went, unaware to me on my left side that I had checked was a driver that was speeding, and he did a mini stop went forward and started blasting his horn at me as I went through. Looking at me he swore and said something about young drivers being dangerous. That type of thing scares me no matter what a little car like mine seeing a big car like that. Little protection is what scares me about it. 

Handling 3.5/5 
Here in Maine having four wheel drive is a fact of life. Since this is two wheel taking it out in a snow storm is not an option. It handles well in the rain but, not as well as it should, and the good steering for a two wheel coupled with inexperienced is a bad thing. But, I still manage to keep it on the road and since I'm always careful the handling is great. 

Radio 5/5 
A CD player was put in it before my father bought it so it is awesome. It tunes well, the CD effects are awesome, and switching the bass and other menus is a breeze. Everything about the radio is awesome and with the speaker effects there is nothing to beat it. 

Condition 3/5 
A little rust here and there needs a car wash in a bad way. Other then that a little ding king would not be so bad for it. Well, since I'm waiting to get a job then I can do all three when I get the time and money until then that's how it will stay. 

Problems 3/5
Fixing a broken driving joint is the only problem that I've faced with this car.  

Over All 2/5 
While not a bad automobile at any rate protection is limited so it gets a little touchy on the over all scale. Other then that handles good, radio is awesome, and the condition will be better when I get a job.
