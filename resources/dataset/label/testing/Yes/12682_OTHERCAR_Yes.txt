            If safety is your first concern when buying a new car, consider this completely true story that happened to me in May of 1998. . .
My gracious parents wanted their oldest daughter to have a new car for her &quot;Sweet 16&quot; birthday, so they went out and bought me a brand new, black, Chevrolet Cavalier Coupe in August 1997.  The car worked out great.  It's a wonderful first car for teenagers.  It's not so fancy that it is too much to handle, but it's also not the 1983 Buick the poor kid down the street had to scrape together allowances for.
Anyway, one Saturday evening in May I was heading over to a friend's house down a very narrow, hardly paved road in front of my school.  This road has ditches on both sides about 8 feet deep, and NO shoulders at all.  For one split second I casually looked down from the road and when I looked back up I was heading straight into an oncoming car in the very narrow lane beside me.  I jerked back suddenly, started to veer off the road, and jerked back.  The car began to fishtail and I headed straight into the ditch, flew my car straight back up int he air, and rolled it five (count 'em, FIVE) times before running into a barbed-wire fence and landing upside down.
I crashed through the driver's side window, and as I came up, dillusional but fully aware that I was alive, all I could do was frantically run around picking up my belongings and yelling that my parents would kill me.  Any by-standers who stopped were positive I was dead, hurt, unconscious, anything but running around.
After being rushed to the emergency room I was sent home with a few scrapes and bruises.  The Chevy Cavalier held out on me through five spins and even succeeded in keeping the frame sturdy when it landed upside-down.  In short, I was not killed that night because the Cavalier's frame refused to let go of me.  It held it's shape, however totalled the car was, until I could safely get out of the car.
Or was that an Angel??
If you want safety all the way, and can't quite afford a Volvo, get the Cavalier.  It could save your life.
