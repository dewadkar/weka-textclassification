            OK, show me and SUV with this kind of power that gets 22.9 miles to the gallon!  We just returned from a trip to the Wine country in CA over Donner Summit and across the Nevada desert.  So we had flat country and mountains.  The pilot got an amazing 22.9 miles to the gallon consistently. Just so you know, if you go this route, the Costco in Reno has gas = best price.  I followed a Mercedes SL500 and zipped right along with him on the mountains going between 75 and 80 MPH.  
Drives like a car instead of a truck, the DVD system was great, interior room fits our kids perfectly. Our kids they were not with us for this trip.  The third row is made for kids, period.  But it's perfect for that.  When they want to bring a friend along etc, you have the room and the belts.  Some of the Honda shortcuts are very annoying, can't get heated leather, no power controls on the passenger seat, no lighted buttons for the cruse control on the steering wheel, no standard 6 disc changer in dash. I mean how hard can this last one be to do?  
Overall, the best darn value out there though.  I know in 4 years when I sell this it will be rock solid.  Try and do that with a Yukon, Expedition etc.  Not to mention that this has sooo much more get up and go than than either of the aforementioned models.  
We just love it.  We are in the income bracket where we could own a Sequoia, Escalade etc.  But I'm not going to 'donate' my money via depreciation and fuel expense for the sake of a few creature comforts.  One other important thing the pilot has a Gross vehicle weight of 5952, but with a tow package it is just over 6000 lbs.  This makes it eligible for the IRS section 179 deduction of $100,000.  
So do what we are, and buy two.  Our first one is gold sand color and our next one, mine  is going to be that gray blue green with the same interior as our first one, tan leather.
P.S.
We paid about 33.1K for ours.  We used the Costco pricing program to get a guideline on the price, then did our best job.  We live in a fairly small town though and competition is not real good.  You could probably do better in a big city.
