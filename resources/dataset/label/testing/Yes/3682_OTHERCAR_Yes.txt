            The new Civic is bold and new in almost every way.  The engive is noticably more powerful and carries the car better.  When i first drove it, it was somewhat sluggish, but once i broke in the engine, this baby really revs.  The gas milage has also been increased, a welcome change due to rising gas prices.  The interior is roomier for both the front passengers and the rear seats.  The exterior has been trimmed down and makes manuevering the car easier.  Handling is about the same, with the tight turning radius you would expect from a Civic.  Overall, a very good car, at a very attractive price, good for young and old.  Now to the specifics:

The Interior has been almost totally redone.  The dashboard, stereo/environmental control, and instrument panel are much more ergonomic than before.  Dash has red characters and gauges, which makes viewing them at night much easier on the eyes.  The environmental controls are still knobs from the 2000 series, but are much wider, and easier to grip and turn.  
The cabin is also roomier.  The driver, passenger, and rear seats are much more comfortable, are wider and deeper, and actually somewhat relaxing.  The most notable part is the flat floor of the rear seat, making the rear quite accomodating for 3 average sized adults.  
If there is one minor qualm many people have with the car, it's the new styling.  Many miss the old japanese styling and don't enjoy the new European take on the car.  In fact, it reminds me heavily of a Ford Focus.  If exterior is really important to you, and you have a problem with the new Civic, then definitely look elsewhere, like maybe to the corolla.

<b>Now some minor nits about the car</b>

-before, in the 98-00 models, the front beverage cup-cover would block the storage compartment/stereo access (if you had a 3rd party stereo installed).  Now, there is no cup-cover, and the cup holder has been moved closer to the driver, leaving room for both access to the storage compartment and beverages

-when you turn on the front windshield defrost, the AC automatically turns on, even though the heater performs exactly the same task without using gas.  When you switch to other vents, the ac remains on.  

-The windshield wiper control is a lever system, not a dial as before, making it harder to distinguish the neutral position from the on position.  

-The windshield cleaner now sprays in a fine mist, making it easier to clean your windshied.  

-the odometer is digital now, and can only be displayed when the engine is on, although it does have 2 tripometers. 

-the rear middle seat has a shoulder-waist seat belt, which is a welcome addition.

-the glove box can no longer be locked.

-the switch for the trunk release and fuel cover release has been integrated into one switch- you push it to open the fuel cover, and you pull it to release the trunk.  It is now much easier to do both actions without having to look down to find either switch.

-there is a new emergency trunk release on the inside of the trunk that glows in the dark - an important safety feature.

-There is no longer a center console armrest/storage compartment.  

-the new shifter for automatic transmission takes some getting used to.  

That's about it.  The new civic is a great economy and "fun" car, perfect for an economic budget, commuting, and first time drivers.
