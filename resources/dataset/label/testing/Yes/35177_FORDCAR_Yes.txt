            I love my car!  We've had it for a year now and it has 17,000 miles on it.  We do everything in this car.  We drove to Texas for Christmas and back...no problems.  It was comfortable for the trip, (and this included our baby and all of his new presents in the back.)<br>We had a problem, with the lining on the door when we first got it.  It came off and was fixed, came off again, fixed and no problems...and they were very friendly about doing it for us.  Same with the dealer when we bought it.  Honestly we haven't had a bad experience with this car, that's why I want to tell everyone about it.<br><br>Very economical, yet roomy, good, cheap family car.  I love the color we got, it's a light bluish purple, and it isn't cheap looking like the old Escorts were.  And ours even came with a really good sound system with a 6 disc player for free....VROOM, VROOOOOM, VROOOOOOOOM!<br><br><br>
