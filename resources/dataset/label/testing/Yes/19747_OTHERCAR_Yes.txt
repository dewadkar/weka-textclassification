            With 3 kids a van was a must.  We bought this van totally loaded, our purchase price is well above the one listed here.  Oldsmobile has been great.  My battery ended up having a dead cell, so it kept going dead.  Under the agreement they sent someone out on two occasions free of charge to jump start my battery.  Also, I had a flat tire at a little over 36,000 miles, but being that I was 7 months pregnant at the time they still sent me help free of charge!!  The tv/vcr have been great on beach trips, and even from NC to Florida.  The kids have the build in head phones so me and my husband can listen to the radio at the same time.  I love the built in air pump in the back, I have had to use it on several occasions!! The ride is great.  The automatic sliding door is a life saver with a small baby now.  The sound system is good, and the vent system is great.  No where in the van is too cold or too hot.  The seats in the rear are easy to remove and easy to replace.  I can do it with no help.  There is also black netting in the back to help keep things in place.  Plenty of cup holders for everyone.  As far as room goes, we can take our family of five and all the contraptions the baby needs plus my husbands golf clubs on beach trips and no one is cramped!!  We have looked at the new suv's , but nothing has the room and comfort that this van has, especially if you stay under $40,000.  I would recommend this van to anyone.  My husband even likes to drive it, that says alot right there!!
