            I bought this car when it was 2 years old and had 25,000 miles.  I chose the SL1 over a used Cavalier, Neon, Civic, and Corolla (which I test drove and researched pretty thoroughly).  The reasons why:  the fit and finish were poor on the Cavalier.  The Neon had great fit and finish and styling but its reliability record (and the Cavaliers)wasn't as good as the Saturn's.  The Civic and Corolla were great cars and just as reliable as the SL1, but they were more expensive and had bland styling compared to the SL1.  The only option my SL1 has is AC.  It's a 5 speed manual tranny model.  I have added a factory Saturn am/fm cassette stereo which was easy for me to put in.  I also have since added a CD changer.  I've only had one problem in the 2 years I've owned it--a broken wire in the ignition system that was easily diagnosed and repaired at the Saturn dealer.  I was REAL impressed with the service dept. for their handling of the only repair that I've had to have done to this car.  I bought this car becasue I wanted a small, reliable, and fun to drive car.  I am real happy with it.
