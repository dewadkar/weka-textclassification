            Just a few words about an incredible sports car.  I have a 1994 Mustang GT 5.0 5 speed.  This car is a dream for me that I made come true this past summer.  I have always wanted the power and feel and look of a Mustang GT beneath me.  Mine is dark green with tan leather interior and has really low mileage (less than 50K).  This car handles unbelievably tight and is very responsive at the gas pedal.  This car is definitely a looker in the class of sports cars.  I love the looks, power, interior design, Mach 460 stereo system, and response from other people on my car.  The things I hate about the car are minimal, but important just the same.  They include:  terrible in the snow, and heavy rain soaked roads, not very good gas mileage.  Other than that I wouldn't ever get rid of this car!  I would recommend this car to anyone interested in alot of performance in a car for not alot of money.  Insurance is not that bad either.  Definitely get to a dealer or private seller and check this car out.  <br><br>
