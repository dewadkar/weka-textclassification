            I have been a proud Subaru Legacy Wagon owner for a year now and I have NO COMPLAINTS!!!  I bought my car used with no repair history , drove it from Missouri to Oregon, and I have not had a single problem.  Mine is a 1991 with All Wheel Drive traction device.  It has taken me on many road trips through the mountains and the desert.  I have fit 5 adults, a toddler in a car seat, and two dogs all at the same time- COMFORTABLY!!  The winters in Southern Oregon can be pretty treacherous when it comes to the mountain roads and I feel completely safe.  The AWD feature lets me get over the pass without slipping and sliding. 
I have 93,000 miles on my car and I expect it to make it to at least 200,000.  My uncle was a mechanic for AAA which means he has worked on everything from Ferraris to Datsuns and he also drives a Subaru wagon.  He claims that it rates up with Volvos for safety.  
If you are like me and need to drive through all kinds of road conditions and usually carry a full load- you will love this car!!<br><br>
