            This is one fine little car. Fun to drive, quick, responsive, and fast. The navigation system is great and the sound system is one of the best. Heat and AC work fine in our hot southern summers and cool winters. The car has the feel of a heavy model and is fast almost to a fault. I have to really pay attention to my speed or I find I am cruising at 90 mph when it feels like 70. The quality of finish is way above average and we have had no problems with the car during the first eight months we have driven it. If you can find one buy it. You will not be disappointed. The only negative I have for the car is that being over 6 feet tall my head just touches the top of the car in the upright position that I like use  while driving. Even with the seat in the lowest position my hair just touches the top. Reclining a  few degrees takes care of the problem but I wish I could be more upright. Overall I think this is one of the best cars for the money in the world. <br><br>
