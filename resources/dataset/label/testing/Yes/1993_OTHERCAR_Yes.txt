            This is my first Nissan Maxima although we do own a 1997 Nissan Altima.  We compared it closely to the Camry but I liked the feel of the car and the styling better than the Camry.  In addition, in the Maxima, there is no need to change a timing belt at 60,000 miles as on the Camry.  The car has great power on the highway and feels solid and comfortable.  The CD player sounded just fine and the dealer even through in the 7 disc changer.  

This car is fun to drive as it handles well.  The only minor complaint is with the remote keyless entry system.  My wife likes it when all the doors are unlocked with one button push and she also likes the horn sounding when one unlocks the car.  On our Altima, all the doors lock when we start the car but that security system did not come from Nissan.  I happen to like that feature.

I would highly recommend this car.  although it costs a bit more than a Camry, in my mind you get more car.<br><br>
