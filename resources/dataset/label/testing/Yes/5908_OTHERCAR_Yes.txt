            I ordered the car on Volkswagon's build quality. Mine is the 2.0 Litre Gti, All I can say about this car is that it's soooo smooth and calming to drive, that you could almost fall in love with it. Why can't all cars be this refined. I am not just being biased here, my car is a company owned veichle, and I had to wait almost 6months for delivery. During that time I drove an assortment of cars from Rovers to Fords, all under the ï¿½20,000 pound bracket, except for the Audi A3 I found the Golf to be the most comfortable, refined and enjoyment out of probably 10 cars. An excellent choice. It could however do with a little more power, but I don't see the car as a adrenaline rush, for that I use my Yamaha R6. It's not a car you want to zoom around in, it doesn't give you an aggressive ride it's more for people who like to relax and enjoy a smooth comfortable ride, but still have enough power to get you upto speed quick enough. My partner has just bought the Polo Gti, which is a more aggressive not so smooth smaller version of the golf gti, Excellent fun but I'd still rather drive mine. :) But if you want an aggressive drive go for the Polo Gti. 

A simple test for anyone is just open and close the doors of the Golf and you will realise the difference between a VW to a Ford, Alfa, Rover, Honda, Peugeot, Renault etc etc etc the list goes on and on. !!!<br><br>
