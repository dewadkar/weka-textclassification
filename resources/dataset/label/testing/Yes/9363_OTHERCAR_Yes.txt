            We recently purchased the Olympus C-2500L to use for business, personal and volunteer efforts.  My husband and I both use it, we practically fight over it.  It seems to have features that would suit just about anyone.  My husband has never been much of a shutterbug, but he was able to pick it up and use it effectively with little instruction. I, on the other hand, used to be a free-lance photographer (using 35 mm).  You have the advantage of SLR lens, being able to adjust the F stop and focus to make more creative shots.  The prints come out gorgeous!!!  I found that this camera had a much better lens and photo quality than cameras in the same price range.  We love the 32MB cards that can store photos without having to download all of them to our hard drive.  This is a great camera for beginners and pros alike!!<br><br>
