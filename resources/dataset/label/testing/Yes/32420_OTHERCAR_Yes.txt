            My family has always owned Honda's, so when I went shopping for my first new car, it didn't take me long to decide that it would be a Honda.

At first, I was going to purchase a Honda Civic LX, because there happened to be a really good sale on them at the time I was looking, but then I saw it .....a 1999 Honda Civic EX, fully loaded, &quot;turn your head red&quot;, just sitting there on the lot waiting for me to drive it away!

The car was pretty much brand new, with only 1100 miles on it.  When I took it for a test drive, I knew I had to have it.  It just fit me perfectly!

What do I love?
I love the sporty new look of the car
I love the gas mileage it gets ...about 28 &quot;in town&quot; miles and 33 highway miles.
I love the 6-speaker sound system
I love the comfort and roominess of the car ...even though it's a 2-door
I love the smooth and quiet ride
I love being able to slide back the moon roof and let my hair blow in the wind

What do I hate?
I hate the transmission ...the car tends to shift strange, especially when using the &quot;Accelerate&quot; button on the cruise control.  Be prepared for the car to rev up to 4 RPM's when you hit this button.

This is the perfect new car for someone just graduating college.  It was very affordable, and the insurance on it isn't too bad either.  Since it's a Honda, you can almost be assured that other than routine maintenance, it will require little repair work.

I love it!
