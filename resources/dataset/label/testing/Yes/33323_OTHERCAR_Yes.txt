            Ecclesiastes 3:3 reads �There is a time for everything, and a season for everything under heaven.�  There couldn�t  be a more fitting explanation for the Buick Park Ave.  Everything has its place in the automotive world, and the Park Ave. fills its place nicely.  Let�s face it, this is not a sports car, it is not a hot rod, and it is not a European touring sedan.   It is simply a luxury car, granted the Ultra is packed full of power, but still this car is ultimately about luxury.  And at $37,000 the Park Ave. represents somewhat of a bargain in terms of  luxury for the money.  

I know a lot of  people under 40 think the Park Ave. is strictly for the retirement home set, but that couldn�t be further from the truth.  The Park Ave. Ultra is fast, and with the optional suspension package exhibits less of the body roll found on the Park Ave.�s GM stable mates.  The Park Ave. is a great cruiser.  Admittedly the styling is bit stodgy, but it is not a bad looking car, the rear seems to have a bit of a sporty flair while the chrome grille up front projects an elegant quality.  OK some people say it looks like a middle aged persons car (my wife for example), but I say it looks� established.

Inside the Park Ave. are all the luxury gadgets that make an owner feel as if his/her money was well spent.  Leather seats are big and soft, however the so called �convenience console� is anything but convenient and it is just plain ugly.  Also, it seems like the bucket seats that come with the convenience console are slightly less comfortable than  their non-bucket counterparts. The driver information center is well placed, and can be read with a quick glance at the bottom of the tachometer, however the buttons which activate the display are placed at an odd angle on the left, outside edge of the dashboard. Even though some buttons are placed oddly, they retain a high quality feel unlike some less expensive GM products.  A/C vents for the back seat passengers are almost a must in a car this size.  The back seats offer almost limo like room and comfort and the front seating area is quite large as well � perfect for long trips. Trunk space is plentiful as well.  On those long trips, the steering wheel left me wishing for a little more padding, the hard plastic seems rather cheap.  Stereo sounds great, and the Concert Sound III speakers are  incredibly clear whether your blasting Mozart  or Metallica.  For $37,000 I�d expect a CD changer to come standard.  The Mazda Millenia is thousands less and has a cool 6-CD changer built into the dash. 

On the open highway the big Buick really feels at home. An open stretch of road is  where the Ultra really shines.  What could be better than 240 hp, a vault like cabin and a �Best of the 80�s� CD?  Not much.  Sure the Park Ave. is not the car you would choose to race down twisty canyon roads, but remember �there is a time for everything.�  The Park Ave. is time for a nice quiet ride.  Expect nimble handling or fun tossability and you�ll be disappointed. The Ultra�s ride is soft and cushy around town, but lacks the detached floating feeling found on older Buicks and Oldsmobiles.  Large dips or small hills at speeds over 40 mph can result in excessive bouncing  from the decidedly un-sporty suspension.   This car is fast in a straight line, but after all is said and done, it is no BMW.

Overall the 2001 Buick Park Ave Ultra is very nice and luxurious car for the price.  A smooth, quiet ride and subtle power are its strong points.  On the down side, the interior is not very well thought out, and especially annoying is the so called �convenience� console.  Also, American cars tendency to plummet in value on the resale market may leave some owners scratching their head in three to five years.
