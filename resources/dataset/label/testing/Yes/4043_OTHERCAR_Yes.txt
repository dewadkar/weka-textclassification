            My job enables me to drive every type of car, truck and utility vehicle on the road.  In three months when the new style, 2000, Chevy, Tahoe comes out I will be purchasing one for several reasons.  It is the most comfortable, smooth riding of all the utility vehicles I have driven, with the GMC Yukon, running a close second.  

The Tahoe is roomy, for both the driver as well as the passengers.  It does not drive like a truck, but an expensive car, with all the comforts. 
The heated seats, in my opinion, are a waste of money as who wants to have a &quot;hot&quot; bottom.  It does not take that long for the seats to warm to the interior temperature.  

The new z71 off road style Tahoe, is to expensive to take off road.  It looks good, but all the added, costly features are strictly for off road use, so why pay for all the bells and whistles to drive it on the road.  
This vehicle is great to carry items in and convenient to lay the back seats down instead of removing them like some of the passenger vans.  When you travel and reach your destination you can unload the car and put your back seats in place and be ready to transport the guest you are visiting.  
Overall I can't wait until I will be purchasing my own Chevy Tahoe.<br><br>
