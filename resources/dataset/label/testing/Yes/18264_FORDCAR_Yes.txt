            My parents invested in a Ford Escort nine years ago for my older brother, and after three high school drivers, it is still running great for me.  I was actually kind of hoping that it would break down, and I would be able to get a new car, but it's just too reliable.  Of all the economy cars my family has owned, this one has the most pick up, and has lasted the longest.  The car is durable, powerful, and does great in the snow.  Mine has seen more than its share of Colorado winters, and it always handles great.  It also gets pretty good gas milage, so it's not too terrible to fill up.  I'm not going to pretend that I know a lot about cars, but I do know that this one is reliable, durable, and fun to drive.<br><br>
