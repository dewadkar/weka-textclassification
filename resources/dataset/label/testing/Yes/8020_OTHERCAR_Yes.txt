            This is an amazing instrument.  

There is absolutely no comparison.  No longer will you have to face the all-knowing high school yearbook geek whom knows you've been up to something dirty when you pick up your film.  You can print all your nasty photos from the comfort of your own home and more!

For years I had to hear this S-!^ from my wife.  &quot;Don't take a picture of that!  What would people think?&quot;  Now I don't have to worry about what people would think.  It's all digitally contained in the privacy of our own home. While my wife is still suspicious and neglectful of my pornographic tendencies, at least now when I take a digital picture I don't have to feel guilty getting it developed any more.

The picture quality of the 300Z is just about as good as a standard camera.  The only difference is that this little bastard of the 20th century monstrosity shows the slightest ghost of pixels when you blow up your shot to an 8x10 print.  Even with a 35mm SLR standard however, you are going to sacrifice quality for the size of the photo you want. To me that�s no big deal.  

If you are no great photo journalist/artist type you will love this camera. I take pictures for memories sake and I am impassioned about this little chome colored sexual gem!  

You can take shots of you and your sweetie posing in a particle board cutout of Goofy and Mickey Mouse beating the hell out of each other at Disney Land and have the shot persevered for printing that very night on a lap-top without having to spend the extra bucks for developing or having to submit a second mortgage on film like the average Joe Paycheck does every time he/she buys Fuji at Disney World.

It�s all very convenient to say the least.

The first week I got mine, I was a celebrity.  It came in the mail just before my wife and I were to go hiking in Colorado.  I opened it up on the road to Estes Park and at first I was extremely disappointed.  

To the inexperienced hand it takes crappy shots in low light.  The 300Z also has a difficult time dealing with portrait studies.  In other words, it will take the person whom is the most beautiful soul in the whole wide world to you and invent flaws in their face.  I must intone however that this is no Nikon.

Once I got use to the bastard contraption however, I was taking shots that would rival National Geographic.  People in the restaurants that we would stop at were looking at the pictures on my camera.  They recognized trails we had been on and commented on the images of the light snow we got into during our hike saying things like:  &quot;Wow.. It really dumped on you guys.&quot;

This terminology for snow scarred me frankly... yet; I was triumphant in my knowledge that after the third theft of my third camera I had made a good purchase in the 300Z.  

Genius is a trait I have such a hard time dealing with.

To summarize... this camera is a bit difficult to get use to.  The LCD screen is a [nastry word] to see in sunlight and you will have to use your point of sight instincts to take shots at high noon on a cloudless day. The lens has its shortcomings when taking pictures of close up still-lifes for artistic merit (to impress your friends).  However, once you get use to the 300Z's handicaps you can take pictures that are worthy of comment (especially since you can delete the bad ones with the camera's editing option before ever downloading them).

If you have an ability to see something and say &quot;I would like to remember that in the future.&quot;  I say get it.  Polaroid�s suck butt and their film is expensive.  This baby will pay for itself in film and developing in no time.  Plus you can take guilt free nudes of your wife and when she makes you angry you can alter them with the free software that comes in the package!
