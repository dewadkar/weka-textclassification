            If you have champagne tastes in automobiles and a limited beer budget you might want to consider a Daewoo Leganza. The Leganza, especially the CDX model, retails for around $19,500 and provides you with every option you could ask for in a luxury automobile. 

The Daewoo CDX comes equipped with leather seats, simulated wood grain dashboard, six CD changer, AM/FM Cassette/CD, power windows, power locks, alarms system, keyless remote, cruise control, air conditioning, power sunroof, and a host of other options typically only seen on much more expensive autos. 

This model drives like a much larger vehicle, has seating for 5 large adults, and tall/short drivers are equally at home in the vehicle.

Leganza compares to the Toyota Camry and Nissan Maxima in size and sells for thousands (about 5) less. All scheduled maintenance for the first three years is paid,as is roadside assistance. Daewoo offers great financing on their 1999 models as well as cash back. All cars are going to depreciate as soon as you drive them off the lot so why not spend several thousand less to begin with?<br><br>
