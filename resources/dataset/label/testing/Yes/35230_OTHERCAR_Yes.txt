            Hello Everyone

Recently (last year) my father purchased a 4-Runner.  He was reluctant at first, but after driving it for a few weeks, he was thrilled.  He feels that it's one of the best cars that he has ever owned.  It's reliability is superb, Toyota's are excellent cars.  It has a powerful V6 engine, with off road packages available.  It's very nice on the inside,and ther're lot's of amenaties that other car's don't offer, such as a rear heating system and a hatchback window that's electronically controlled.  Options such as a sun roof and a CD changer are also there, if u choose to upgrade your model.  
All in all, the Toyota 4Runner is a very wise decision if you're in the market for a new SUV that's reliable and fun to drive!  <br><br>
