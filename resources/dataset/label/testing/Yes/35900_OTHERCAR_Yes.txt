            When I got my first drive in an M3 back in early of 1998 I knew that this car right here is the one and only car that everyone in the world should own.  Talk about the perfect mix of acceleration, suspension, power, and steering all in one very sleek and professional looking automobile.  With BMW's M powered V6 motor the 1998 M3 has 240 HP and comes in manual transmission only.  The car has great kick in any gear and it always seems to have reserve power every time you increase the pressure on the throttle.  But the true fun of this car comes when you take it out on the backgrounds.  This car takes turns like nothing.  It seems to handle itself around any curve and with the traction control there has never been a safer way to take a curve faster.  Ontop of the great road performance this car includes a Harmon-Kardon sound system that is the next best thing to having a live band in your car with you.  The system has a 12 speaker setup including two 8 inch woofers and midrange speakers all over the place.  The one flaw that I was able to notice in the car though, was that the steering wheel does not telescope out.  Meaning that if you have long legs and short arms, you will either have to sacrifice leg space for easy steering or easy steering for legspace.  In the end though it didn't really affect the way I drove the car.  The 98 edition of this prime BMW is a fantastic car, but the future editions of this automobile will include better acceleration, different body design, and a V8 motor which will make it a contender against ANY other car.<br><br>
