            I bought this car slightly used from a Lexus dealer in Houston.  The car has met all my expectations.  The car is extremely quiet for the performance and power it has.  The EPA mileage estimates I saw before making the purchase were 18 city and 24 highway.  I have been averaging 15 mpg with a mix of city and highway driving.  My driving style may be a factor in this.  With the traction control off, it is possible to easily spin the rear wheels on dry pavement.  The 17" wheels are much noisier than the 16" wheels, but the performance gain more than compensates.  Check out www.clublexus.com for great information on this car.
