            My 84 Toyota Camary runs great, my 84 Toyota 2wd Pickup still runs great with 240k (but it is time for an upgrade). When I decided to get a newer truck, the decision to get a Toyota was easy, finding one that someone wanted to sell for what I wanted to spend was a bit more difficult.
After searching the net for a few weeks I was able to bring myself up to speed on a 94 Toyota 4x4's worth and options. I felt very fortunate to find this great deal, but I had to work at it.

This truck is better than I could have ever imagined! Although it is over 8 years old, it drives like new. It gets 22 mpg and responds a lot like a passenger car. In 4wd low, it will inch slowly up inclines that would take your breath away, this is one great truck!
The tail end is a bit on the light side, but I just throw a couple of sand bags in the bed during the Winter months.

If you want a truck for pulling a heavy trailer or hauling heavy loads on a regular basis, there are better options. If you want a truck to abuse and beat up, buy a Ford or a Dodge, but for a great all around great looking rig for on or off road fun and transportation you won't beat this truck. With common sense maintenance and care, it'll last a very long time and several hundreds of thousands of miles.

I bought this truck because Toyotas have proven longevity. Their style is timeless, and with a basic set of tools, a manual and a little bit of time, several times a year, for maintenance, one can keep this "Toy" running virtually forever.

I really enjoy this truck and love not worrying about it breaking down, it's very well engineered and built right!
Five solid Stars!
