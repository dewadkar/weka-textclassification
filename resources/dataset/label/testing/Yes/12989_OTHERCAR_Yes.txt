            My Accord was on it's last legs, approaching the 300,000 mile mark, and my credit was unsteady from a divorce not too far back.  I heard the ads that Kia would "Finance anyone", and they did.  The interest rate sucked, but at least I could get to work with no worries, right?

Well, a Rio is reliable transportation, for sure.  I have no complaints with that, it was a very reliable ride for the two and one half years I owned one.

My liked mine and went and got one of her own, still has it.  Hers is the Auto Trans model, whereas mine was Standard Transmission.  Although I got slightly better power and mileage, it wasn't all that noticeable a difference.


My complaints:

Interior panels never were attached right in some places, and never was fixed well, they always popped back out later, and I finally gave up and left them in the garage.

The body panels are very thin, and don't spring back from much.  Both mine, and my wife's Rio's picked up many dents in the parking lot that never went away, often missing paint to the metal.  which leads to complaint #3

Cheap paint.  The paint on these cars is...not very good, thin coats that remove easily and show wear early.

Seats:  Not too uncomfortable, but the cloth on my driver's seat wore down to metal within a year and a half on the entry side.  Maybe I'm just too big for a Rio.

What I liked:

It's cheap.
It's reliable.
It got pretty good mileage.
It had surprising power, manual or auto trans.
The cassette stereo wasn't half bad.
It really wasn't a bad car for trips, and it was plenty comfortable for commuting.
The Air Conditioning kicked butt.
(BUT) It zapped power bad on hills (ok, pro + con)

That pretty much sums it for me.

If you are looking for cheap reliable transportation, this will do.  Don't expect frills or lasting value in the marketplace.

I will update this page with any major problems from our remaining Rio.
