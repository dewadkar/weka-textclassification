            Though we were not in the market for a L/C per ser, when my wife and I saw  and better yet test drove the L/C, we knew it was the vehicle for our family needs.  It handles like a champ in snowy conditions.  My family lives on court at the bottom of the street and when it snows in Lexington, KY, it really snows.  Previous winters, my Porsche nor my wife's BMW were able to get up the hill to go to the store to purchase the necessary items 
for a ice storm.  The first winter with the L/C, all our neighbors wanted to ride to the store because their vehicles lacked the front wheel or four wheel drive mechanism.  The roads no one wanted to tackle during the snowstorms, were like dry paved roads for the L/C.
