            After saving up money for a car for about 4 years, my parents were shocked when their 18 year old daughter bought a silver grey 1984 volvo wagon. What kind of 18 year old buys a station wagon? I did, and it was BY FAR the best decision i ever made. My Volvo was a total work-horse, i drove her to death. in the 2 years i had it i put nearly 100,000 miles on her and she had over 100,000 when i bought it. The only problems i ran into where with finding competent people to work on my Volvo and when i did, being able to afford to get the work done. I had the standard transmission 4 speed with automatic 5th gear (overdrive) in a turbo. She had real get-up-and-go. Unfortunatly, the automatic overdrive went out at about 175,000 miles and i could never get it fixed. I would recommend a volvo wagon (especially the 1982 - 1987) to anyone who wants a safe and reliable car and can afford to do the maintenance on it. Perfect for college students (like me) or people who want to be able to drive with both passengers and a dog in the car. My volvo died the day that the new star wars came out, the engine blew (my fault). But even with a blown engine i was able to sell it for over 500 dollars. And i actually cried when i sold her.
