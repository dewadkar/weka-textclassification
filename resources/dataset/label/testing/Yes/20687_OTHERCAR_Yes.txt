            I have had my S70 T-5 for almost three years. Because the car was based on the 850, I knew a lot of the kinks would be worked out. I loved the look of the car too. I opted to buy instead of lease, because I knew I would keep this one for a while.

I checked out the GLT and the T-5. The GLT (Light pressure Turbo) was a hair faster off the line, but once the engine spins up to 2300 rpm, the T-5 becomes a rocket. It handles great too. The only downside here is that insurance is pretty expensive. I have no tickets and over 30 years old the best and deal I could get was about $800/year. I was a bit surprise given I am driving one of the safest cars in the world. The GLT on the other hand would have been about half as much to insure.

I really like the interior. The seats are so comfortable. Looking behind you takes a little getting used to with the high headrest, but after a couple of days, it's no problem. 

I was considering a BMW 328 or a Saab 93. I went with the Volvo for a couple of reasons.

1) I am in sales and I don't like the stigma that come with a BMW. I enjoy driving a car with a conservative reputation that doesn't tweak anyone's nose, but drives like a sports car.

2) The leg room in the back of the the Volvo was much better than the BMW or the Saab. Also, if you are considering the S60, consider this too. I think Volvo made a mistake in discontinuing the S70 for the S60. I would understand a new generation of body style, but they lost one of their biggest advantages by shrinking the back seat.

3) The list of standard features was excellent. Mine has every feature, including the spoiler, electric passenger seat adjustments, seat and mirror warmers, CD player, and the trip computer. Everything else was standard: leather, sunroof, driver power seat, traction control, nice stereo (six speaker system), and all the stuff you would expect to be standard.

4) The trunk is huge. I can fit four sets of golf clubs in it. 

Also, experience has proven that it is a capable snow car, even without snow tires. We have a 4WD that we take skiing, but if we did not, I would be perfectly happy taking this car.

When my wife's lease is up, I will encourage her to get a Volvo cross country just because I am so happy with my Volvo.
