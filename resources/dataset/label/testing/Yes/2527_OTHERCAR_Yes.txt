            The only car people die to ride in is a nice Cadillac hearse.  A few years ago I decided I needed a good used car.  After looking in the newspaper and used lots, my brother and I got the idea of a hearse.  We called a funeral home to find out what they do with the old hearse.  They told us that the cars (coaches) are auctioned off at the national headquarters.  He did tell me of a place locally to get an older car though.  We went there and found one.

The 1974 Cadillac Fleetwood hearse was in great shape.  It had 63,000 original miles.  Pampered for its entire life, there is no better car.  Cadillac was at the top of innovation even in the 70's.  Looking through the owners manual, I found out that dual airbags were an option in 1974!  Automatic climate control has been in Cadillacs since the 50's.  

The interior was the real cool part.  I am 6'1&quot; and sitting in the seat I couldn't reach the ceiling!  The back was all original.  It had a wood floor and rollers.  The rollers made it really easy to roll long buffet tables, water heaters, and anything else into the back.  It had brackets which held the casket in place.  These made a perfect place to put a cooler.  I even slept in the back on an overnight scuba diving trip!

The few problems were mostly a result of age.  Things go bad with time.  The challenge is finding someone who will work on the thing!  On several occasions, I was refused an oil change.  The other minor problem was gas mileage.  I got 7 miles per gallon.

The one thing I learned was that if I didn't want to talk to someone at a stop light, I had to keep the windows rolled up!  Otherwise, I was fair game to &quot;Ever had a girl back there?&quot; 

In the end I was proud to drive my hearse and am looking forward to purchasing another one in the future.  <br><br>
