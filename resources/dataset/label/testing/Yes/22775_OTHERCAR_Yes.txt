            These cars are an absolute delight to drive, especially on a long trip.  The car handles surprisingly well in emergency situations, however it does roll a lot more than a typical modern car in hard corners. The ride is excellent on most surfaces.  The interior can seat five adults in comfort with TONS of cargo.  Eight people fit in the car relatively comfortably, although the person in the middle front will likely be somewhat cramped.  Cargo space is excellent, especially with the second seat folded flat.

Drivetrain on this car is very reliable, although the engine is a little underpowered for its size.  Running this engine hard can make fuel economy go down really fast.  The transmission shifts very nice, but I would recommend frequent fluid changes for a long trouble free life.  The standard 2.93:1 gear ratio is good for gas mileage and high speed cruising, but is really sluggish in the hills or while towing.  If you tow or drive in the hills, the 3.23 rear end is much nicer.  The car has excellent traction in the snow, even with a standard "open" differential.

Overall my car has been very reliable.  Keeping on top of maintenance will make these cars virtually problem free.  I would recommend rust proofing yearly to prevent rust.  These cars have very tough bodies, but salty winters can make them rust out quickly.
