            No matter what I do to this car it will not die.....  I have an '89 Toyota Corrolla 4 door sedan.  I have had the car for  4 years now and rarely do I ever have any problems.....I do have a couple of minor complaints   1.  It would be nice if it dinged when I left my lights on....several times I have gone out to go somewhere in my car and I have had a dead battery.  and 2.  My gas gauge is weired....one minute I'll have have a tank and then next I'll have 1/4....  but these complaints are probably just fueled by the fact that it is an older car now.  I think the toyota is a great car for anyone...families too.  I think this would be the perfect car for a first time driver...its small enough to get through tight spaces, sporty, yet roomy, reliable.<br><br>
