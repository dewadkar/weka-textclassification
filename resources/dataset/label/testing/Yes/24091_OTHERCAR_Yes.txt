            The best way to describe this camera is cheap but decent.

You're not going to set the picture taking world on fire with this sub-$100 camera but if you need to take &quot;normal&quot; snapshots and store them on your computer or a website this camera will do the job.

When you consider the price it's actually a great little camera to test the digital photo waters with.  The software that it comes with aren't the greatest in the world either but they are a start.  I would recommend getting PhotoShop to download and edit your pics with but it's not 100% necessary.  I do recommend that you buy the A/C Power adapter to use while downloading pictures otherwise the battery life is pretty short.

The only thing I really don't like is that you can't control the flash at all.<br><br>
