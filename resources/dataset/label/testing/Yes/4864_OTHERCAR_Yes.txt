            The Fuji S5000 can produce what are, without a doubt, some of the best quality pictures in the non dSLR digital camera market. The S5000 benefits from Fuji's brand new Super CCD technology, giving it wider dynamic range (can capture more information from both the shadows and the highlights) and increased resolution.

Color reproduction is stellar. One can even choose a "Chrome" mode, which closely reproduces the look of a very saturated slide film, such as Fuji Velvia. 

The zoom is probably the feature that sets this camera apart. A 10x optical zoom equates to a 330MM zoom on a 35mm camera. That's just HUGE! Let me tell you, it's very convenient to have a moderate wide angle capability and extreme telephoto capability all in the same light, portable camera. 

Although this camera is technically 3.2 megapixels, it can interpolate up to 6 megapixels for very large size prints with no visible loss of quality. The quality of the CCD blows many of the other offerings at this price point away, and no visible color fringing or other abberations are apparent. The camera also comes with a lens hood with a 55mm filter mount, so you can use a polarizer to further increase the aesthetics of your pictures!

Don't be fooled by the low price. Fuji has equal, if not BETTER technology than equivalent Nikons or Canons, and the lens is of excellent quality too. Why else would Fuji be the number one producer of high end minilab and photofinishing equipment? They have put their expertise in this area into the digital arena and made a great product.
