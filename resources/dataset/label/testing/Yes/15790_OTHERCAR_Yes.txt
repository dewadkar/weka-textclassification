            My family bought this vehicle because we have 2 daughters and space was essential.  Our girls, ages 4 and 2 1/2 are still in car seats and the captain chairs in the middle are wonderful.  It allows the girls to see one another, but they are far enough away that one cannot instigate the other if you know what I mean.  They also allow us to walk in to back of the van without getting out of it.  Also, in the LX version the middle captains chairs release forward so it is much easier for someone to use the very back seat. We love everything about this vehicle, the color inside and out (Champagne), the features-most which are standard, the back seat comes completely out for space on a trip, and the SPACE for a family.  The only negative aspect is that the captains chairs cannot slide forward or backward.  The van is very smooth to drive even if you are in in the middle and back.  Also it is easy to handle.  Anyone with 2 or more children should buy this van if you want any type of comfort level.<br><br>
