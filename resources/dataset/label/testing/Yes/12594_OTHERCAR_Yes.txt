            I finally found the right camera!!! I am a happy camper! I got mine at Amazon for only $350. and it included a case,extra battery and another flash card. Good deal. I went ahead and ordered the power supply,battery charger for another $100. cause..you gotta have one if you are serious about taking pictures. I am very impressed with the picture quality. I took my first shots inside in a dim room and I am very pleased. The clarity made my mouth drop,I was really not expecting the pictures to be that good! Be forewarned that pixels are not everything! I just returned a Kodak DC4800 with 3.3 pixels because of the jaggs, so there is more to picture quality than just pixels..yeah,surprised me too. This S10 is soo cute ,easy to carry around,easy to shoot. So far I have only used the auto features,but there are plenty of manual controls to play around with. I advise you to read the install instructions for the USB connection and installing drivers, I didn't and I had to reinstall..good instructions! However I can't seem to locate the image folder in the Zoom software. It gives you the option to use another image program of your own,so you may want to do this. The software for stitching is pretty cool and it allows you to prepare this right in the camera. Neat! I know that after I learn all the faetures on this camera I will have a great time. There is a good manual to explain all these functions.
If you want a great little camera at a low price for the quality then this is the one for you. It is better than the latest version S100 which is strange,but true. I want to thank the other members for giving such great advice. I would not have considered this camera if I hadn't read all the great reviews.
