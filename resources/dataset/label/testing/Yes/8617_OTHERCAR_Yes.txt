            It's been almost a year since we got the Oddy.  They always say the first year is the best one, and it has been.  With nothing more than oil changes and scheduled tune ups at the dealer, this van has been impecable.  Almost 18,000 miles on it and it's still going strong on it's perfect ride (no jinx here).  

The coolest feature of the van is that rear seat that just disappears with the removal of a few headrests.  When I say disappear, I mean disappear, it completely goes into the floor of the car creating a nice wide open space.  What about that nice retractable console between the driver and passenger sides?  That thing was the best invention for mothers and those who need a place for their mobile phone and persons who frequent the McDonalds often with their family and need cupholders galore!  The dash already has two cupholders, but the console adds another 4.  For a family of 6, that's plenty considerring that the rear seat has two more holders.  What about cigarette light power supplies?  Yes, this van has one in the front on the floor already, but the rear has one too incase you need any teenage who needs to finish their paper with a notebook computer in the back.  

So do you want to hear more of the features that I've used over this year period?  Well, short of the power sliding doors, I've found that the standard 'both sided' sliding door has been a nice feature with kids.  The rear heat/ac controls and vents have made the long trips much more comfy.  What about those middle row seats?  Ah, yes, those things are so easily taken out and are lighter than anything!  Seriously, I've had to take them out on numerous trips to the local Crate and Barrel and with that rear seat folding flat in the floor, I could pick up anything at the local CnB and have it home in a jiffy.  

We purchased the LX version and it came standard with traction control (very cool).  I've found that although the LX does have those ugly looking black and NOT color coded ammenities on the outside of the doors and mirrors and handles, it still has been a great looking van.  And what about those wheels?  Yes, the LX comes with steel wheels with covers, but they're still 16" just like the EX.  

Ok, now about the cons I mentioned.  Yes, it guzzles gas unlike many of it's Honda counterparts.  I acheive a nice 18mpg in the city with a long trip 23 mpg on average.  That's not too shabby considerring that the van is like 4300 lbs, just as heavy as my past vans (Astro ALL WHEEL DRIVE).  That's all I have to complain about this van.  It has served me and my family well for a year now and have had no problems whatsoever.
