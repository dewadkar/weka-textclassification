            I currently own a 1995 Toyota Avalon (93K miles), and the car has lived up to my high standards.  I expect a car to perform with little or no shop visits.  I expect a smooth ride without vibrations.  I expect the car to handle well in cold, heat, rain, sleet, and snow.  The Avalon met and exceeded these expectations.  
While owning the car, the performed very well in the Wisconsin and Tennessee states in all weather conditions without any shop visits. Based on five important points listed below, I would recommend this car to business professionals and small families.
1) Very dependable car.  Has always started and worked without headaches.
2) Drives like a luxury car for those who participate in business trips and lunches.
3) Holds 4 people with comfort, back seats are very roomy.
4) Serious trunk room for luggage and travel accessories.
5) Can accelerate rather quickly with the V6 engine.  Gas mileage has positive results with a consistent 25 mpg in the city.
