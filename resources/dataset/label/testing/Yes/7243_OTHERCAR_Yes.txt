            I love this car!  The handling is excellent.  I was concerned about driving in winter conditions, but that all faded quickly.  The front wheel drive is superb!  I live in the Great Lakes area, and snow is not my enemy in this sporty car!  
The V-6 engine has plenty of power and the gas mileage in my automatic is averaging 29mpg.  With gas prices the way they are, this is a definate plus!! 
This car is fun to drive, looks great, and has all the power and comfort options you could ask for.  I especially like the 6 disk CD changer mounted in the trunk.  A friend of mine has the single disk up front, and it is a bit of a pain to load and un-load disks, but with the changer, I load up 6 and am ready to go for the day!
I think this is the ultimate &quot;chick&quot; car!  Fun and easy to drive with just the right amount of pizzaz to turn heads!!  <br><br>
