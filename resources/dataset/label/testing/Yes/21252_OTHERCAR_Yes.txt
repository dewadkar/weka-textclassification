                 Do you want a safe and affordable car for transportation? If so, this is one car you should think about buying. The Toyota Camry runs quiet, and has roomy interior. There's alot of leg room, and the driver seat is motorized. The driver can move the seat higher and lower also. I bought this car because it has been ranked one of the safest cars, and also i have friends who need a ride to school.

     Although, it is a safe car, the brake pads wear out real fast. Every Saturday I have to go to school and I have to drive up this steep hill, and at night when I go back home, I have to brake a lot to keep a 40 m.p.h. limit. At the bottom of the hill, there is a stop light which is usually on red. So I have to keep braking, thus wearing out the brake pads fast. Fortunately I found out that I had this problem by the blinking &quot;BRAKE&quot; icon in the dashboard. So I got it fixed with a whopping repair cost of $300.

     I have learned that this is not a car you will want to go down a steep hill with occasionally, unless you replace the brake pads with some good ones.

     Other than the brake pads, this car has been easy to clean, the cd stereo system is great, and did I mention ROOMY?<br><br>
