            For less than $100 you can't go wrong. Takes "good" pictures for the price - not great. However, you can use the software or other image editor to correct/improve brightness, focus, hue & saturation. Great for emailing pics and posting to the web.

Would not use for serious photograhy. I plan on eventually upgrading in the future as I a learning more about taking digital pics. The only problem I had within a years ownership was with the CompactFlash Card. I thought something was wrong w/ the camera, but tried getting a new Card b4 scrapping. I actually bought a 64mb card and it is working great although the instructions say 32mb is the max. I bought this in error but seem to be fine. Takes 99 pics at highest resolution.
