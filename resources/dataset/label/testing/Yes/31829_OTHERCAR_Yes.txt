               I consider myself a very performance oriented person.  I choose my cars carefully and make any after-market changes I feel needed.  When I first looked at the Civic EX 4-door, I was looking for potential.  This car is full of it.  With the many cool after-market accessories available, I was sold.  
   For the normal person, however, who just wants to buy the car, and live with its weaknesses I have to say this.  The engine on the EX, the only one I would even consider (Except the Si), is not as powerful as you would think.  The engine is weak unless you rev the engine above 4,000 RPM, or near the redline, in each gear.  You should also know, that like most Honda engines, it revs high.  The redline is at 7,000 RPM and it screams power there. 
   Something I must also say is that this car needs much firmer suspension.  I live on a very curvy road (55 MPH speed limit) and one of the first after-market things I bought, behind 17" wheels, was performance springs. The average person usually cannot afford to spend an extra $300 for sporty springs to improve the body lean and handling.  In addition, the tires are excessively small for the EX name.  Even the Civic Si coupe needs bigger tires and wheels. 
   Why doesn�t Honda make a Si trim in the Sedan?  I enjoy coupe cars, but for some reason I am attracted more to the sedan.  I do think the coupe is sporty looking though.  The sedan almost looks like an Audi A4 or BMW 3-Series car.  The styling is very cool and after-market styling choices are very cool.  I do not think I am aloud to mention any certain body kits or spoiler brands, but there are some good ones out there for the Civic.  They are not cheap and most range from $500-$850. 
   In conclusion, if you don�t have the money to improve the your Civic EX Sedan 4-door, you should be prepared for the following. 
  
Bad Things     
        1) Limited low RPM Power & Torque
        2) Body roll
      
And the following good things
        1) Sporty when driven hard
        2) Many after-market choices
        3) Good Character
