            This is actually my wife's car but I get to drive it once in a while and am a passenger frequently. I'll start out by saying that I'm 6'3" and she is 5'2" and we are both comfortable driving it. The seats are very comfortable and adjustable to get the right driving position, and outward vision is clear and unobstructed.

The motor is a blast: rev it above 3000 rpm (where the turbo first kicks in) and let it wind out to red line, it is smooth and torquey, plenty of predictable power. Shifting is enhanced by the sport shifter package (a worthwhile option). The chassis is set up very well, so cornering is superb and predictable. All wheel drive makes for great handling on a variety of road surfaces, we've tested dry, wet, snow, ice, gravel, dirt, it takes it all in stride. Anti-lock brakes, front and side air bags, head restraints in the rear, an impressive list of safety equipment. The premium sound system is another worthwhile option, the powered subwoofer is terrific.


This is an amazingly versatile and compatent vehicle, fun to drive, well designed and built, solid, great road manners.


Drawbacks? Not too many. Premium fuel is required and expect around 20 MPH. The Impreza is a small car, so if you're used to larger vehicles this will really stand out for you (but hey, it is a sports car). The original tires are mediocure and won't last long.


No visits to the dealer so far, reliability is what we've come to expect from a Japanese car. All we've done to it is change the oil and kept air in the tires.
