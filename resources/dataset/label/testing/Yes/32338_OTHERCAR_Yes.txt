            Okay, let me begin by admitting that this camera is not
perfect. Most of its shortcomings can be overcome, however;
and for those willing to adapt to it the F300 can be an
outstanding instrument.  In my opinion it is the best 
digital camera yet in a specific niche once occupied by 
the lauded Leica M3 of the '50s:  extremely small and light
but very flexible, capable of taking sharp, beautiful
photographs in a variety of situations with a minimum of
effort. For many it's all the camera they will ever need.
 
Many other reviews and websites cover this camera's specs
and features in exhaustive detail.  If you are reading
this review you probably already suspect that the F300 may
be suitable for your needs.  I thought I'd focus on the
quirks I've found that might make you unhappy with an F300
purchase, and some possible workarounds that might make
the F300 acceptable.

I've found three main flaws in the F300 that mar an
otherwise excellent package.  The most bothersome for me
is a tendency toward graniness in some types of pictures.
Large areas of a single dark color show this flaw most
apparently, particularly blue sky.  In manual mode one can
force the ISO setting to 64 which helps reduce this
tendency.  I also imagine that image editing software such
as PhotoShop may have tools to correct this, but that would
only be worth the trouble for the most valuable of images.
Please note:  this graininess does not obscure fine details
or reduce overall contrast in the image. It is as if one
were shooting ISO 800 film in a high-quality 35MM camera.
You get very sharp, contrasty images with excellent color,
but noticeable grain in some open areas.
 
The only other flaw that directly affects image quality is
a good bit of barrel distortion at the wide angle setting.
For portraiture or nature photographs this will be of little
concern, but for architectural or urban images it can be
a nuisance. The only simple solution is not always possible:
back yourself up and zoom out of wide angle mode. Otherwise
you can spend some more time in PhotoShop.  Besides this
one flaw, though, the lens of the F300 is one of the best
in any compact digital camera, with high contrast, very
low color fringing, and excellent resolution.
 
The last flaw I'll mention will probably bother casual
snapshooters the most:  The autofocus has trouble in low
light situations.  There are several remedies for this
problem --

1) Put the camera in Aperture Priority mode and set it to
   F5.6 or F8.  This will give you greater depth of field,
   but will make the flash work harder to keep up.
2) Use manual focus.  Hey, some of us remember when that
   was the ONLY focus mode available!
3) Hit your subject with some additional lighting, push
   the shutter release partway to lock focus, kill the 
   extra light and then take the pic.

Of course, Minolta could make this problem disappear with
the addition of an autofocus assist lamp to the F300.  
Let's hope Minolta reads reviews.

I bought this camera to use while travelling, which for me
includes backpacking.  It suits my needs perfectly.  I
can buy AA batteries anywhere, and can use CR-V3 and 
rechargables too.  It shoots excellent nature photos and
razor-sharp macro pics.  The colors are beautiful and 
natural.  The five megapixel images let me do final 
cropping and composition at home without losing a lot of
image detail. I love the little remote control you can buy for the F300. 

If Minolta starts making an F300 Version 2.0 that fixes
any of the three problems I mentioned, I'd buy it in a
second!
