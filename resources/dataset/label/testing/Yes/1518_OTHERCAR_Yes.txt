            I fell into this car back in the end of 1995.  I didn't think I'd like a Saturn.  But there were several factors that changed my mind:

*Styling.  They restyled the SL and SW for the 1996, and it no longer looked boxy and stiff.  Smooth, rounded lines - it turned a lot of heads when I first got it.
*Service.  Saturn is famous for it, and my experience was no different.  The sales consultant let me test drive five different cars (model/trim levels) before I bought one.
*Gas mileage.  It gets 35 mpg average on the highway, and I get up to 38 mpg in some cases.
*Maintainability.  There really isn't anything that needs to be done.  This car now has 128K miles on it, and it looks a year old, tops.  The plastic door panels really keeps the car looking new.
*Reliability.  I've had some problems with it, but nothing out of the ordinary - serpentine pulley, auto window regulator, wheel bearing, battery, tires, and rear brake caliper have all been serviced or changed.  The tires lasted 84K miles!
*Repairibility.  I do a lot of my own work on the car, and I've had very little trouble repairing my car when it was required (saved a lot of $$$).

The only two issues I have with the car is the engine noise and the cost of aftermarket replacement parts.  The engine noise is notorious on pre-1997 models, until they redesigned the engine (I've heard the difference for myself).  Parts cost is high - I replaced the rear caliper and it set me back $120 for a remanufactured one with new pads.

My next car is a 2001 Saturn SC2!
