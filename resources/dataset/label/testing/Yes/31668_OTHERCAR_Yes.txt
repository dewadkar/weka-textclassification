            We owned a 1989 Chevrolet Mark III van.  It was nice when we got it, with a very nice interior, and very comfortable seating.  The 305 CI V8 got it moving pretty quick.  We got a great trade-in on it, which made most of the problems worth while.

First of all, it was very roomy, and all of the doors were great(six in all).  The seats were comfortable, and it easily sat seven people with four captains chairs and one bench seat.  It was fairly tall, fitting my Honda motorcycle in the back at one point.  The towing package was a nice addition, and with the 5.0(I think) liter engine, it could easily tow heavy trailers.  Driving this behemouth was a pleasure, smooth, responcive, it acted more like a car than a truck.  The speedometer broke off, but was very easy to replace.  When the seats needed to be removed, it was fairly easy.  The captains chairs were on hardmounted bolts, and very easy to remove.  The bench was mounted from underneath, but still an easy removal and install.

There were quite a few cons though.  The engine was crammed in there!  It was very hard to work on.  After only 160,000 miles the engine was ready for a rebuild.(At this time we traded it in)  Although it was in dire straights, we still got $3,000 for the trade, half of what we paid.  Which, after six years was a great return.  One of the captains chairs was attacked by a 50 lb dog, which broke the mounting system, fortunately, there was plenty of room to incorporate a twin bed.  In heavy precipitation, often leaks would accrue on the inside.  This problem was never solved, but it also wasn't much of an issue since they were small leaks.  The stock stereo face was horrible, and the cassette wore out, not ejecting properly(sounds like a personal problem) after a while.  As always, Chevy needs to use primer.  The paint, although very detailed and beautiful, chipped very, very badly.  A sticker placed on the paint by the previous owner removed quite a bit of pigment.  Gas mileage was a steady 15 mpg, but the 35 gallon tank gave it a giant range.  I don't know the exact weight of this van, I'm guessing it to be 4,000 lbs or more.  The brakes barely contained this, and should have been bigger.

If you had the chance to purchase one of the these vans and needed the extra room, I'd say go for it.  It offers power, room, comfortability, and a nice feel of the road.  Definitely recommended.

The only reason we will not own another is because it was fairly outdated, our Blazer does everything as well, except seating, but the extra capacity is not needed anymore.<br><br>
