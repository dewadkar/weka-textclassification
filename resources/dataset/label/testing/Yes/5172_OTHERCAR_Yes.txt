            When i bought my 1999 Dodge Dakota I was truly excited! Now a year later...the only thing I am excited about is getting my Toyota Tundra.

   After about 3 months of a good truck ...my luck changed..i developed a leak in my back window. I took it to the dealership and they &quot;fixed it&quot;. I have siced had it fixed 4 times. My most recent problem was the radiater fan. For some reason it malfunctioned and would cause my truck to over heat when idleing. That to was also fixed by the dealership..Luckily I got an extended waruantee.


   I've gone about 2 months now with no problems..it has 15,000 miles, and the leak seems to have gone away? It hasn't over heated in a while so i hope that is fixed too..

   I guess I am giving Dodge an unfair chance but i dont think I'll by another...TOYOTA HERE I COME!!!!
