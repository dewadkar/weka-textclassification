            This car has a V8 engine with 360 horse power. By giving four wheel drive and good traction, I suggest this car for your family when you drive on road trips or if you are venturing in rugged terrain. The new model has stereo in the back for head phones and controls to control sound and volume. Two seats in the back with ample leg room, can be put down to provide room for carrying items. The middle row of seats can hold three people with an adjustable arm rest if no one is sitting in the middle seat. The front of the car has a 6 disc cd changer and great volume control with a mini sub woofer in the back. The back of the car can come with an extra stair for easy access and  a spare tire for any flats. The steering wheel can also be heated for those cold days.<br><br>
