            I'm presently looking to buy my 4th Ford pickup, and my 3rd supercab. The truck I own now is a 4x4 with the 4.6 V8 engine and 3.55 rear ratio with the off road package. I would not opt to get this motor in this type of truck if you are considering to tow anything or live in hilly or mountainous terrain. I thing the weight of the vehicle along with the 17 inch tires is to much for the motor and the rear end ratio offered. I have drove the same model of truck with the 5.4 V8 on trips in the mountain regions of Montana, and have had no problem with it being under powered. Gas mileage was also very comparable to the 4.6 engine. The 4.6 engine is a excellent choice in the same truck in a 2 wheel drive version. <br><br>
