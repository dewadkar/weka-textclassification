            I drive a Green, 1995 SL1.  It is within about 300 miles of the 50,000 mile mark and shows no signs of stopping.  It has required some maintenance, but I know I can trust the mechanics at the dealership where my family bought this car, Saturn of Columbus North.

So far, they have had to replace the front car seat, a tightener (the alternator belt was wearing), an engine valve, and two spark plugs.  This may sound like a lot of items, but after each repair, the car has operated just fine.  I see no reason that it won't last at least 2 or 3 more years.

UPDATE
JANUARY 12, 2000

I happened to notice that my Saturn is only 65 miles away from 50,000!  To celebrate the occasion, I think I will clean the car.

UPDATE
SEPTEMBER 9, 2000

Tonight, my car surpassed 55,000 miles.  That is roughly 64 round trips from my Columbus, Ohio home to its birthplace in Spring Hill, Tennessee.<br><br>
