            In October I needed a car because my VW Jetta's lease was over.  I wanted to stick with VW after 3 years of satisfaction with an Audi followed by another 3 years with the Jetta, but none of the dealers were able to find me an automatic.  A Saturn dealership recently opened near my house so I decided to go look at them.  I wasn't sure about leasing this car.  First-I was actually afraid it was too inexpensive to be any good and Second--I never had an American car before. Originally I was considering the S Series, but when I saw this blackberry L200 I was sold. This car is beautiful--and you can't beat the price.  I have every option I wanted  for a lower lease price per month than I was paying on the 1997 Jetta. And they really mean it when they say no pressure.  It was the most relaxed, comfortable car leasing experience I ever had!  <br><br>
