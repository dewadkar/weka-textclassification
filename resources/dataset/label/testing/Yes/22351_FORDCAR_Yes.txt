            After having my 2000 Expedition for about three weeks I'd have to say the jury is still out on whether I love it or just like it.

Update 2-17-2001: Have had Expedition for almost a year. Like the ride and reliability. Hate that it has blind spots in the corners (front and rear). Constantly feel as if I'm about to run over a little kid on a tricycle when packing out of parking spots. Will probably opt for an Explorer next time around only because I don't like the blind spots. Everything else has been perfect. No defects or complaints. This is a BIG vehicle.

The things that I absolutely love about it:

a) It is bigger (more storage than my previous Explorer) but doesn't drive like a big boat.

b) Rear seats are available as buckets instead of benches. I have two infants and it makes it much easier to get into the back and walk right through to the third row seats (also an option).

c) I find the ride to be very smooth.

The things that I am still trying to decide whether I like:

a) Gas mileage - this you should know before the purchase. It gets around 13mpg average. Don't hope for anything much better. With gas hovering in the $1.80 area and a 30 gallon tank -- expect BIG gas station bills!

b) Reliability - within a week of picking up my Expedition it stalled right in the middle of an intersection. It hasn't done anything since, but I am very concerned and hesitant about pulling out into traffic.

Overall I think that I am going to enjoy this SUV very much. My previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer which I did not have ANY trouble with for the whole 2 years I drove it.
