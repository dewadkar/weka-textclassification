            We decided on the Kodak DC4800 last year because we had heard good things about it and it was on sale for under $500.00. We have 35 mm camera equipment but being able to shoot a picture and see it instantly was really appealing. 

The Kodak DC4800 has a resolution of 3.1 megapixels so the pictures come out looking clear and professional. With the Kodak pictures, even larger photos I ordered from Snapfish or OFoto looked as good as ones taken with our standard 35mm. I have ordered 8x10 photos that turned out crisp and clear from the digital camera, which was impossible with our old Polaroid Digital. 

The other feature I really like are the different photo modes for pictures. You can select black and white, sepia toned, saturated for deeper colors, and other options. Each of the modes gives your photos a completely different feel to them. The sepia is sort of fun to play with because it is like taking old time photos. 

If you are interested in the specifics of the camera, it comes with the camera body, a compact flash card, lithium ion battery, AC adapter, USB cable, cable for viewing pictures on the TV, Kodak software, and user guides. The camera also comes with a strap so you can wear it around your neck. The feel of the camera is a lot like a 35mm. 

There are still some features that I am not that comfortable using and my husband has figured them out much quicker than I have. The Polaroid camera we used had alot fewer options and I could operate it easily. This one is easy to operate but I haven't learned all the neat tricks to it yet. 

Some of the features include a 3.1 megapixel resolution, a 1.8" LCD viewfinder, a 3X optical zoom lens, automatic or manual settings, a self-timer, and a built in flash. I haven't played with the manual settings much and usually stick to automatic but the lens can go from a wide angle view to a telephoto shot. With the viewfinder, you can see the photo and decide right then whether you want to keep it. You can also use accessories with the lens, which is nice if you have filters. The camera also has a tripod mount but we haven't used that. 

The zoom feature allows you to go from telephoto to wide angle.

The highest resolution is 2160 x 1440 but you get fewer pictures so if I just want some quick snapshots to email then I stick with lower settings for more pictures. If I am having them printed then I always use the highest resolution setting for best quality. With different ISO settings at 100,200, and 400 you can change how your photo will look when it comes out. The different settings are good for changes in lighting. 

If you just want a simple camera to snap and go then this is the right choice. We still use our standard 35mm for capturing our son's every move to film but the digital is great for quick snapshots to send to family over the internet.
