            This is my third Toyota truck, I've had an '85 2wd and a '99 Prerunner. Now I own a 2001 4x4.  

If you are interested in the Prerunner, please read my epinion review of the 1999 model. 

I Loved my Prerunner, I could take it �almost� anywhere. I never officially got my Prerunner stuck, my locking differential bailed me out more than a couple of times, and I had to back down a mountain trail once (embarrassing!). With my Prerunner I quickly learned my limitations, so when it got totaled in a wreck there were no second thoughts, I was ready for a 4x4. 

Agility: Obviously this thing is going to out climb my old Prerunner, and it does by miles but it also out performs 4x4�s costing thousands more. When I went looking for a new truck, with the hassles Toyota dealers were giving me, I though I might upgrade in size and go for a Z71 Chevy. My buddy has a �97 Silverado and I really like it�s style. Since I was not interested in a huge truck I test-drove a 2001 Z71 reg cab, it actually has a shorter wheelbase than the xCab Tacoma. I took the Chevy and a 2001 Taco off road back to back at an obstacle course down the street from a Toyota dealership. Going up steep grades in the Chevy I felt like I was flying a 747 jumbo jet. I could see nothing but sky out of the cockpit! The Toyota has plenty of visibility. Going over deep ruts I plowed the front tow hooks of the Chevy into the dirt, the Taco�s high front approach angle glided over everything. The power steering on the Z71 was so cushy that the wheel lacked feedback, with the Taco I really feel connected to the road. The cab room in the Tacoma xCab is comparable to the Z71 regular cab, and actually you have more storage with the Toyota. On the plus side for the Chevy you and your passenger don�t take up each other�s space, there is plenty of elbowroom. The Z71�s shortcomings could be overcome with a lift kit, and some getting use to (visibility and steering), but the Chevy is $5k more and the Tacoma is ready to roll. I�m never going to be one of those extreme 4x4 guys who goes out hunting boulders to traverse, but when it comes to going in deep this truck is superior to your average 4x4.

This new 4x4 really zips through desert trails. This is one area where I thought the Prerunner would out perform the heavier 4x4. Just as in my �99 Prerunner the Bilstein Shocks on this 4x4 really eat up washboard trails. Also I find the truck has a lot less over steer when running dirt trails, when the truck gets loose, the front wheels just drive into the slide. Shifting into 4 hi on this truck is a snap. You don�t have to overreach, move from your seated position, or take your eyes off of the road. It takes little effort to move your right hand from the wheel down to the center console and pull the truck into high-gear 4wd. I thought I might want the optional 4-hi selector switch Toyota offers, I�m glad I did not get it, it simply feels cool to pull this truck in to 4wd on the fly. 

Style: Okay I started off stating there were no second thoughts, well with respect to 4wd that is true, but I was hung-up on the 2001 Tacoma grillwork for awhile. To avoid the �ugly grill� I considered buying a 2000 model, but with the interior upgrades on the �01, I decided to live with the looks. Right up until I bought the truck I was thinking, �okay after I get this thing I�m going to have to replace that grill�. Well after owning this truck for three months I have to say the looks really grow on you, the grillwork is just beautiful. I�ll go out on a limb here, I think I get what the Toyota designers were up to. The grillwork is kind of a retro design. I guess the current run of Tacoma�s are due for a major body-off design change, this last iteration is a flash back to pre �97 and the first Tacoma�s.   

Fuel Economy: 20 MPG from an automatic V6 4x4. My Prerunner barely got 20MPG so this is great, I did not lose fuel efficiency going from 2wd to 4wd.

The Bad: The biggest complaint I have about the new interior is that Toyota stuck with the cheap cushy seats from �99. When I drive longer than an hour I feel as if my butt is going to slide down into the floorboard. Also there is little lower back support. Aside from still being uncomfortable, the stitching on my seats appears to be crooked. I actually think the �01 seats are worse than the �99. Also on a poor workmanship note the center console on my truck was installed with a couple of cross-threaded screws. My last interior gripe would be that my '99 Prerunner had two grab handle's for the passenger, and one for the driver. My '01 4wd has a single handle for the passenger, and none for the driver. 

The Good: Despite the seats and handles, overall Toyota did a good job on the design changes for 2001. On the outside instead of 15�s you get 16� alloys with bigger tires, and as an extra bonus you get that front-end artwork :) . On the inside the door panels are more sleek and comfortable, and the controls from the A/C to the side mirrors are neatly laid out and are easier to reach. The instrument cluster seems a bit dated, and I can take or leave the new white face gages. The headliner seems thicker, and it�s my impression that the road/wind cab noise is way down over �99. The six-speaker stereo with CD and cassette looks and performs better than the old system, and the door tweeter�s work well. 

Toyota Motor Company in General: I like the Tacoma, but am not fond of Toyota in general. Toyota builds great running trucks, but customer service appears to be an after thought. I ran around in circles trying to order special packages for my truck, things like a sunroof, ABS and the Limited package. Man I really wanted the firm sport seats offered on the Limited Tacoma. These options were available in other areas of the country, however (speaking with Toyota Motor Company) I found I could not get them on an xCab 4x4 in Arizona. Toyota knows they build solid trucks, the dealers know they sell, and you almost have to take what they throw at you. I am very happy with my 4x4, but when it is time for a new truck I will definitely shop other brands in addition to new Toyota�s.

If you are thinking of doing an internet purchase please read my review of Carsdirect.Com . 

Conclusion: There are trucks out there with a more comfortable interior ride. The Tacoma is a pure 4x4. With the TRD package you get 16� wheels, tall tires, plenty of ground clearance, great shocks, a locking rear differential, and unbeatable off-road performance in a stock truck. You get all you need to hit the trail in confidence. Toyota Motor company is not the greatest when it comes to customer choice, but the Tacoma is a great 4x4.
