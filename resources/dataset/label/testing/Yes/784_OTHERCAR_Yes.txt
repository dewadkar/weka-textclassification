            Earlier this month, my father and I had an extended fishing weekend in Alaska, traveling around Anchorage and Kenai Peninsula; I have already reviewed the trip itself. But obviously, in order to get around the vast distances even in this relatively small section of Alaska, a car was necessary - so my father reserved a midsize car. But as things turned out, we ended up with a free upgrade to a minivan, specifically this Chevy Astro - and it was an upgrade well needed.

<b>Exterior</b>

It looks too familiar. Astros have been around since the Ice Age, and the unflattering boxy shape of my particular example proved it outright. In order to look less Neanderthal and more sophisticated, my example came with light tan bumpers and body cladding as well as chrome wheels complementing its dark blue body - a combination I didn't mind. On the doors were the badging "ASTRO AWD," with "AWD" in red, to emphasize that this vehicle was equipped with all-wheel drive. While I see very few AWD Astros on the mainland, I found that virtually all Astros in Alaska were AWD.

<b>Interior - Up Front</b>

Just like in the big vans, the engine protruded somewhat into the cabin, and the engine cover pretty much made for a wide separation between the two front seats. Above it was a rather high dash, consisting of two nearly symmetric pods, housing the instrument cluster for the driver and the airbag for the passenger. I found the instrument cluster a typical Chevy variety, with a 100-mph speedometer flanked by voltmeter, oil pressure meter, fuel gauge and temperature gauge, but no tachometer. On the left side of the steering wheel was a stalk that controlled turn signal, cruise control, AND wipers - that's a bit too much there. Headlight switch was located separately at the far left end of the dash.

In the center stack, tilted well toward the driver, were the climate control and the radio. The climate control had three easy-to-use knobs, but they lacked separate recirculation and A/C controls. The radio housed the clock - typical domestic feature - which was just fine because I turned off the radio to avoid those politically tainted Anchorage radio stations; it did sound good though when I managed to turn it on. Below it was an add-on CD player, which seemed as it would get gummed up from drink spills, because of the two cupholders right in front of it. To the right of these items were switches for rear A/C and heat, plus the rear gate wiper.

Above my head was a console that could house sunglasses, garage door opener, and a few other items. (Sorry, no HomeLink here.) But its star feature was the trip computer, which proved to be very helpful during my journeys. It could be switched between US and metric units, and could display such items as direction and temperature, average fuel economy, instant fuel economy, average speed, and expected range with given amount of fuel.

I noticed that the dash itself was in one shade of gray and looked fairly nice in a van setting. On the other hand, the various switches and parts - including awkwardly high power window switches - were in different shades of gray, at least four on my count, something GM is notorious for.

<b>Interior - Seating</b>

This was a rental that had taken some serious abuse. A lower cover of the driver's seat had been knocked off, couldn't be put back, and was stored in the back. That said, the seat was decent - although the power adjustments were near the engine cover and very hard to find and use. I nearly fell asleep at the wheel quite a bit though, but I'll blame much of that on the northern summer twilight and the hard schedule. The passenger's seat was manually adjusted.

The second and third seats could handle three passengers each, although the right seat belt anchor on the second row was missing, and ugly metal parts were showing. This definitely was an abused van. These seats could fold down or stay up, or they could be removed altogether. Sorry, but there was nothing nifty like the disappearing seat of my Honda Odyssey. Besides, those bench seats looked heavy, and I wouldn't even attempt to remove them alone.

In any case, this vehicle sits high, and it's a long climb to the seats. It won't be a good idea to be dressed like my namesake character (R.I.P.) if you'll be traveling in an Astro.

<b>Doors and Gates</b>

The Astro is an old design and hence has only one sliding door instead of the now-usual two. My example was, again, a very abused one, and the sliding door was jammed, making it hard to open; otherwise, it moved smoothly.

The rear gate was of an unusual design which I appreciated. I would insert the key into the top part of the three-part gate and turn it left to unlock; then I'd push the keyhole and pull the handle to open it. I could then reach over to grab small items, or swing open the lower two parts to the sides to lift heavier items.

<b>Driving</b>

Honestly I had absolutely no intention of doing any driving in Alaska, but eventually I ended up doing much of the driving myself. I have some previous experience with full-size vans, including a Ford E-350 moving van I once rented from Ryder, and this Astro felt just like them, only with softer ride to cope with those Alaska potholes. Acceleration took a while, and I had to be very careful around corners to avoid leaning dangerously. At least the 4-speed transmission shifted well, and the shifter was straightforward PRND321; it also had a special "Tow/Haul" mode I could trigger.

Visibility was excellent, since this was a high-sitting vehicle. Even to the sides and to the rear, the visibility was fantastic. The three-part rear gate, which results in a one-piece rear window, really helped out with the visibility part.

It was also very nice to know that just like virtually all GM vehicles nowadays, my Astro had daytime running lights. Since Alaska law requires headlights to be on at all times when driving outside major cities, it was a good thing. The pleasant surprise, though, was the automatic lighting at night; if I started up the Astro when it was dark enough, I'd get not just daytime running lights, but all lights - headlights, parking and taillights, dash lights, etc. - without having to manually turn them on.

The onboard trip computer told me that I was averaging about 18 mpg in city driving and 20 mpg when driving the Seward Highway around 60 mph. It's a bit lower than I'd like, and I'd blame the AWD for eating up a bit extra gas. I didn't feel any difference driving with AWD, I must say, but then I was driving in warm, dry summer weather.

<b>Quality</b>

Driving a badly bruised rental for only an extended weekend does not give me much to say. But that said, I was happier with this Astro's workmanship than other GM vehicles I had driven before. The switches are in different colors, and a few plastic parts are cheap, but I can live with that in a van like this.

<b>Verdict and Afterthoughts</b>

I did my driver's ed on the original Dodge Caravan and now drive a brand-new Honda Odyssey, and this Astro is definitely a very different breed of van from either of them. I felt that the Astro drove and felt like a full-size van while most minivans act more like a family sedan. With all the fishing gear I had to haul around, a minivan was definitely a welcome upgrade, and I don't think a midsize sedan would've done it; but honestly, I would've been happier in a more carlike minivan.

Nevertheless, I had a good experience with the Astro. It gave me a comfortable ride over the Alaska potholes and carried my gear in style. The view was excellent, and the rear gate design clever. I just had to be a bit more careful in my driving.

As a normal minivan, the Astro is a heavy, hard-to-drive, and aging design. But for heavy-duty use, such as driving through bad weather or towing, the Astro is ready, with optional AWD and an automatic transmission that has a separate towing mode. (Even though I can go to a Honda dealer and buy a towing package for my Odyssey, I'll never tow with it!) For what it is, the Astro is unique and capable, and I'll definitely recommend it. I just hope that GM will bring it up to date by replacing its Reagan-era look and adding a second sliding door.
