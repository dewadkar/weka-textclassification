              I originally was looking for a Grand-Am when I came across the Achieva 6 years ago.  It was about 4 thousand dollars less than a Grand-Am in similair condition, and they are virtually the same car with different skin.  I knew the wheel bearings were shot when I test drove it, and factoring this into the price, it still was a good deal.  The stock Good-Year Eagle tires were worn out, so I replaced them with Eagle GT-2 tires, that were breaking belts and totally worn out by 60,000km of easy driving by my wife. They have since been replaced with a set of Cooper tires from Sears, that are far better than the Eagles.  
  After I purchased the car and got it home, I mentioned to a Olds-mechanic friend of mine that I had had bought the Achieva with a quad-4.  He said he would be watching for me at around 80,000km when I wound be bringing it in with a warped head.  This caused great concern, and after searching it out on the 'net, I was convinced it was just a matter of time.  The car now has about 175,000km with no head problems yet(KNOCK ON WOOD!).  
  Other problems are doors that lock you in at 5mph(keeping rescue crews from getting you out in an emergency!), cheap interior quality(a few rattles, door lock buttons that stop working or fall into the door), check guages light comes on here, there and everywhere for no reason(anyone know how to fix this?), condensation in the oil(no, it's not anti-freeze), wheel bearings, and creaks and groans from the rubber steering bushings that require an injection of grease once a year.  
  Over-all, while the quality of the car is fairly low, it has not yet left me stranded, and it hasn't given me any major repair bills.  It is a fun car to drive(with 190 ponies out of the quad-4) and a 5speed.  You must be capable of repairing small stuff to own this car, but it has really been fairly cheap to own.  While not many people know what an Achieva SC is they agree it is a fairly nice looking car(2-door, with 16inch wheels and bologna slicer on the trunk). It has not yet rusted(approaching it's tenth birthday!), and I would keep it for a few more years but the wife is increasing the pressure to get a mini-van...
