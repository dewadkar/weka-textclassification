            My mother bought at 98 Prelude brand new. I LOVE preludes, always have, but her car seems to be something of a lemon itself. The car is gorgeous , don't get me wrong, but it doesn't seems to be holding up very well. First of all, the blind spots on this vehicle are ridiculous! The panels between the front and back windows make it very difficult to see anywhere. 
Second, When you put the car in gear, and touch the gas, or sometimes when you are coming to a stop there is a horrible grinding noise! It sounds like a transmission thing, but it doesn't do it all the time so mechanics don't seem to catch it. I wouldn't be suprised if it turned out that the nifty little automatic / standard transmission isn't that great after all. I mean it is convenient but I don't think they really worked out all the kinks. She keeps very regular maintenence on it at a honda specialized mechanic too, putting in only honda parts.
I am a huge fan of the moonroof/ sunroof as well but this one isn't very big. Also, the seats just seem to stiff and the interior is nothing to get really excited about. Also, I noticed, is red like a accident magnet or what?? This car has gotten more dings in it than anything I have seen in the past two years! 
Please don't think I am bashing hondas or preludes, I have a trusty old 86 prelude myself and I tell you, it may not look like much anymore but it is more comfortable than my mother's 1998 prelude! I could go for the looks and the speed, but mine is just great.<br><br>
