            The Mitsubishi is a great automobile until it breaks down.  The car I have at the moment has 60,000 miles and is a 1996 Mitsubishi Montero Sr.  I loved this car as soon as I bought it; great off-roading experience, luxury, nice ride, everything I wanted.  The car tended to &quot;ping&quot; as I call it if I did not use at least mid-grade fuel and if I pushed the engine too hard - especially up hills.  I was taking a right turn to park and the car just shut off.  Every time I took my foot off of the gas the car would shut off.  I ended up taking it in and the mechanic said that these types of cars tend to last up to 80,000 miles and then start to have problems.  To fix the car, he just &quot;adjusted some tubes&quot; and it stopped quitting on me.  I think that I will see if it continues to break down on me and then I will rid of it, but if it doesn't, I plan to keep this car for a long time.  If you are to get a Montero, lease it or plan on selling it before, I say, 70,000 miles just to be safe.  The Montero is a nice luxury vehicle but it is hard to maintain and is too heavy for the type of engine it is equipped with.  Good luck!
