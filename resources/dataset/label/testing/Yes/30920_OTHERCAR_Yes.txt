            When Chrysler introduced the Sebring convertible back in 1996, it was a dream on wheels. The beautiful body, and new updated styling looked marvelous.

It was the perfect predecessor for the tired LeBaron.

I first saw the car at a local dealership. The salesman, knowing it caught my eye, handed me the keys and let me take it for a spin. I was looking for something more economical....but this salesman was no dummy. He knew after a single drive I would be hooked.

And I was. =)

The Sebring JX convertible rides like a dream. Her wide wheelbase makes even the tougher roads seem like polished glass. The glass back window is another great feature. Much better than the usual &quot;plastic&quot; windows that are frequently seen on ragtops, the glass one won't yellow, and is always easily viewed though. With the top up, it's almost like riding in a regular full-sized hardtop vehicle. One drawback however, if the glass ever gets broken, (and trust me here, it's happened to me one time while I was putting the top down!) it's gonna cost you a pretty penny to fix. The glass itself is NOT CHEAP...Mopar likes to think everything they make is made of gold. On top of that, finding a auto glass repairman who will even DO THE JOB is tough, and pricey in it's own right. (Most glass places will not do a convertible-top glass, and will refer you to a specialist due to the difficulty of installation.)

A real benefit of the Sebring over all other convertibles in it's class is the roomy backseat. Very rarely would you find a huge backseat in a ragtop. Compare it to an Eclipse or Ford Mustang and you'll see and feel the difference. The car gives you breathing space, which adds comfort to the ride.

Besides her good looks, decent gas mileage, affordable price, and smooth ride....the Sebring convertible has a dark side.

Two words....electrical problems.

Chrysler first issued a recall on ALL 1996 models, due to significant problems with circuitry. Even the newer models have had very similar problems. I myself, have seen this &quot;electric gremlin&quot;. After a year of having my car, the RPM gauge went nuts. The radio freaked out, and suddenly died...no power to the central console at all. Shifting gears with the headlights on, or merely dropping your speed dims your lights so badly you can hardly see for a second or two. 

Overall, the Sebring JX or JXI is a great buy. Nowhere can you find such a stylish convertible with as much items at such an affordable price. But as with any car you purchase, be sure to have your warranty handy, and take even the slightest electrical malfunction directly to your dealer. If you let even a little go, it's all downhill from there...

....and it's a bumpy ride all the way down that hill. =(
