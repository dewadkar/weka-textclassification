            I wanted something different and found it when I entered a Volvo dealership.  There it was, in all it's shiny, silver splendor:  the Volvo S80! It's distinct, yet attractive grill let me know I was looking at a Volvo, however, the new look of the S80 was different than anything I remembered Volvo being. Looks aren't everything though so it was the introduction to the many safely features built into this car that really got me hooked.  For those of us on the road a lot or parents with one or two small children, the safe environment of this vehicle is very reassuring. 
I have been driving my Volvo S80 for about five months now and there is very little that I don't like about it.  If pressed to find something, it would be the visibility when backing up.  Even though the specially constructed headrests in the back flip down, I still find I have to be extra careful to make sure the coast is clear behind me.
All things considered I would give this car an A+. I would definitely consider purchasing a Volvo in the future but since I was told that some people keep their Volvo's for up to 17 years, I may not have to make that decision.<br><br>
