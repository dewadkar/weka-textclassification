            Recently our company decided we didn't need our company cars anymore, and it was finally time for me to purchase my own vehicle.  I just bought a house (fixer-upper) and found my Taurus just couldn't handle 2x4's.  So, with that in mind, my quest for a new vehicle brought me into the SUV arena ... something I told myself I would *never* own.

I shopped for weeks and weeks and sampled nearly every model within my price range ($10,000).  When it comes to the Pathfinder no one can touch this vehicle for the money.  It's solid, stable, quiet, and has a reputation in the long run to be reliable (go to www.jdpower.com and see).

My first gut instinct, like all Americans, was to go get a 4Runner.  They are reliable, have power, and are revered in the auto community.  Well, after driving a 4Runner and then a Pathfinder, all's I can say is that the Nissan felt more sturdy.  Every 4Runner I tested (1993-1996) had torn leather, faded instrument panels, wishy washy suspension, loud interiors, and the like.  These test drives were not exclusive to my price range.  I went up to $13,000 on the 4Runner.  The Nissan won hands down, period.

There are a few quips, as with all cars cuz none of them are absolutely perfect.  I won't go into the power thing as everyone has already commented on that.  One thing a prospective buyer should know is that the Pathfinder has a documented history surrounding the exhaust manifold.  Because of a design flaw at Nissan, these tend to "blow out" more often than other models.  The cost of this is about $600 for both sides ... more if the bolts are broken.  Make sure that before buying one you have the compression test performed and have them inspect the exhaust manifold.  I did with mine, and Nissan is going to fix it at "shop cost". You'll know they are going as the engine will have a faint "dieseling" sound. Also, the steering on mine is a bit squirrely.  I had the front-end checked completely before purchase and my mechanic said there was nothing wrong.  This could just be part of the design, or that I am so used to passenger vehicles that the "play" in the steering wheel is commonplace for this sector of the auto world.  Don't know, but I'm going to have it checked again.

Interior fit and finish is supurb.  The SUV (never call the Pathfinder a truck!  Unlike the 4Runner, the Pathfinder is NOT based on the truck platform) even under shaky circumstances does not rattle or shake.  Not one bit.  And the transmission is as smooth as silk.  Turning radius is very impressive, as is the handling.  The A/C runs COLD and the heating system can get the car burning hot in no time.

All in all, for the money I sincerely and highly recommend the Pathfinder.  You won't find a better deal out there.
