            The '98 9000CSE is the last year of the 9000 model, and arguably the best year to buy.  Each '98 9000 came in CSE trim with all of the goodies - the only option you could add was an automatic transmission.  The 9000 was introduced in '86 and underwent a redesign in '93, and by '98 the car had been perfected.  Only 1200 '98 models were imported to the US before the 9-5 was introduced.  While the 9000 was an older design by this time, it still held its own with brand new models.  


EXTERIOR 
Exterior styling is a matter of opinion, but I can assure you a bright "Imola Red" '98 9000 draws frequent compliments.  All '98's were originally equipped with 3-spoke alloy wheels with low profile tires, and a standard plastic rear spoiler which improves the appearance.  

INTERIOR
Inside, the 9000 is loaded with amenities.  Features include 10 speaker Harmon Kardon stereo with in-dash CD, wood dash, trip computer, power windows, heated power mirrors, powered operated glass sunroof, remote power locks and built-in alarm system.  I may have forgotten some - almost everything you could think of is there.  The front seats are 8-way power adjustable and heated, and are some of the most comfortable seats ever put in a car.  I have driven 1500 miles from Maine to FL in 2 days in this car, and even on such a long trip they are supurb. 

ENGINE
The only engine offered was Saab's classic turbocharged 2.3L four-cylinder.  This is truely a marvel of an engine - the power is unbelievable, yet it still gets 27-28 miles per gallon even at a steady 80mph.  Power output is 225hp for manual transmissioned cars, but limited to 200hp for automatic models.  The takeoff is incredible, especially on the highway - nudge the gas and the car goes from 60 to 80 in the blink of an eye.  

TRANSMISSIONS
The 5-speed manual transmission is manufactured by Saab and is generally quite reliable.  The 4-speed automatic is a german built ZF unit, and is less reliable - has been known to fail as early as 50K miles or sooner, although some units have lasted over 200K without any problems at all.

RIDE AND HANDLING
As generally expected of a European sports sedan, the suspension is tuned more towards crisp handling than soft ride.  The car takes the corners quite well, and the ride is not overly harsh.  However, if you're used to Japanese or American cars, you would probably find it a bit firm...

RELIABILITY
I would say maintenance and reliability is about average for a late '90s European car.  There are a few known problem areas, but they aren't much more than minor annoyances.  www.quasimotors.com is a great website dedicated to the 9000, and has some great tips on what problem areas/what to look for.  Regular maintenance goes a long way towards keeping this model in good shape... however... it is nothing like, say, a Toyota Camry.  More on the lines of Volvo/VW/Audi/Mercedes, not as bad as BMW.

SAFETY
Saab has a long record for being a pioneer in safety, and the 9000 is no exception.  Saab as somewhere around 40 different crash tests they do when designing a vehicle.  Some of them are situations that no other manufacturer takes into consideration, such as the "moose test", which involves throwing an 800 lb. bail of rubber and steel at the A-pillars at high speed.  This safety-first design philosphy pays off, as the 9000 had the LOWEST highway fatality rate of any car for several years.  I was personally in an older 9000 when it rolled over 1.5 times, and was impressed at how well the car held up (I was uninjured). 


Overall, the 9000 is a car for someone who really enjoys driving a well engineered vehicle, and doesn't mind taking the time/spending the money to keep it properly maintained.  At around $15,000 for a low-mileage '98, the model is also relatively affordable.  If you are considering purchase of this car, I would definitely recommend test-driving one, and also visit www.saabnet.com to get an idea of the owner's community for the car (there are bulletin boards where you can ask any questions)
