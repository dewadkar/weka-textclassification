            This car is mainly designed for teenagers and young adults.  For people who are looking for a good handle, SPEED, and attractiveness.  This compact sports car is best driven with a manual transmission which is offered in the SH model.  The SH model also includes the spoiler which makes the car sleeker, and more aerodynamic.  

Some may be concerned that this four valve engine may not be powerful enough however, Honda has perfected the VTECH engine which enhances the performance and speed of the vehicle.  

Main problem- lack of space in the back and only room for four.  this minor problem is minimal compared to the other benefits-- comfortable seats (relative comfort in the back) and nice interior.  

Driving this Honda is a great thrill.  The sport shift version available is a nice attribute yet the real joy comes from driving it in manual.  This is the only way you can get the full feel of the car and experience its power.

Try it for your self.<br><br>
