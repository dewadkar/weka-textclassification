            Loving your "ex?" Didn't know you were married! No, silly, that's loving my E.X.-model Accord. And who wouldn't?

This is my second Accord. My first was a 97 Accord LX and I loved every minute I drove it. Because I now have a job where I commute a lot more miles every day, I decided I wanted a sunroof, leather, and a CD-changer ... so I bought a 2001 Accord EX. I'm very pleased with the decision. 

As I'm sure you know, Honda's fit and finish is superior. There are no rattling doors, no mysterious noises, no leaking windows. This car company knows how to put an automobile together. It kind of amazes me, when I think of all that goes into a new car, that it can meander down a winding road and not even have one rattle in all of its moving parts. My refrigerator makes more noise than this car does inside and so do a lot of other new cars on the market. 

The 2001's interior has some nice improvements over the earlier model that I drove. First, I chose the EX with leather package, and the leather in this vehicle is very nice. It's gathered and creates a nice custom look and feel. In a way, I guess I really like it because it <i> looks </i> like leather, not like vinyl. The faux wood grain trim around the interior door handles and center cup holders is nice as well, but I wish Honda would have included the wood trim around the heating/a.c. controls and the stereo. It looks unfinished there, although there is an add-on option for that piece at a price of about $100. 

Others have reported that the seats are a bit firm. I don't think so. I find them to be just right as far as that goes. I do find that they are shorter in seat length than the 97's which would concern me if I wasn't of average height. The driver's seat in my EX has an 8-way power adjustment, which is a nice feature, of course.

The EX has a power sunroof that tilts and slides back. And a nice feature along with that is the ability to close the windows or sunroof for a limited amount of time even if you have removed the key from the ignition. That's thinking!

My EX is a 4-cylinder manual, which I chose for very specific reasons. I have no need for V6 or the hefty gas bills that go with a bigger engine. I like the manual transmission because it makes driving a bit more fun, although the manual on the Accord is so refined that it isn't as much fun as, say, the Passat (which was a close second for me when I was looking at this car).

I don't need to go into any detail on styling. You know what an Accord looks like. They are everywhere. I find the styling to be somewhat ho-hum, but Honda owners generally don't by their cars for fantastic, sexy looks. I think we buy them because we know they'll last and won't give us fits. The Accord presents itself in a straightforward fashion without a lot of hype or Hollywood. That's perfectly okay with me.
