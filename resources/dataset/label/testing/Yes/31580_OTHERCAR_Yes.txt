            The Nikon Coolpix 800 does not have ultra high resolution, super fast performance nor does it raise the standard for new technological achievements.  Quite the opposite; it is a �plain Jane� reliable working and well designed 2.1-megapixel digital camera.  Its appeal is to the point and shoot crowds and in a point and shoot situation it does extremely well.  The camera is in fierce competition and is unrightfully overshadowed by equal point and shoot cameras from Canon and Olympus.

With its alkaline batteries and 8MB CompactFlash memory card the camera is a lightweight, well-balanced camera.  Although the camera body is entirely of plastic it is still a nicely designed camera.  It has an exceptionally well-designed hand grip for securely holding the camera.  On the top is the information LCD and the back has a nice image viewing LCD.  I don�t particularly like how the playback LCD software works.  On playback there are actually two images on the screen that superimpose themselves on top of each other.  The first quick image is a very course picture that always surprises me into thinking my captured image is out of focus.  Then a second later a finer image is overlaid on top to clean up the course image.  I�ve never gotten used to the way the 800 does this.

The 800 is a 2-megapixel machine with four image quality modes called simply hi, fine normal and basic that is easily accessed though the �QUAL� button on top of the camera.  It saves in both JPEG and high quality TIFF formats.

Although this is an automatic camera there are a couple of adjustable controls.  There are adjustments for image quality, focus settings in automatic, macro and full manual, single or multi-shot modes, five different flash modes, three different types of metering modes, three different camera speeds, white balance controls and exposure compensation.  There is an unusual image taking option that I have never used called CONTRAST +/- and LIGHTEN +/-.  Most of these features are accessed though easy to get to buttons.

Although the 800 does have many options for photographing, the camera is simple and fun to use.  There are surprisingly very few buttons on the camera.  The buttons are well-marked, conveniently placed and easy to use.  And with only a few menus, commands and options the camera is easy to set up and is ready to shoot quickly.  It is designed to be ready to shoot in a minimum amount of time.  The internally adjusting lens moves into position fast.  The camera has an unusual feature of a real time, constantly adjusting, lens that is always focused on your subject so the shutter lag time common to other digital cameras that focus only when the button is pressed is eliminated.  The continuous focus is an option that can be turned off to conserve battery power.

The image quality is excellent.  The pictures always come out well exposed with sharp resolution, beautiful contrast and accurate colors.  The 800 also has an equally impressive macro lens.

The camera does have the unusual �Best Shot� option that is handy and amazing to use.  With the best shot option on, if you press and hold the shutter button down the camera will take up to ten pictures, analyze each picture for the best focus then automatically save the best shot.  Don�t quite throw away the tripod but in slow shutter situations the camera will get sharp pictures that I couldn't get with other cameras.

Exposure is calculated with three, all accurate, modes.  The camera gives you the option of using center weighted, spot metering or, my favorite, Nikon�s famous matrix metering mode.  Matrix mode magically compares and analyzes 256 areas of the scene with a stored reference library of typical compositions and automatically sets the exposure.

Nikon is a nice company to include a camera case.

It isn�t a perfect camera.  With only a two to one zoom there are many times I have wished for a little more reach to grab the perfect image.  F/3.5 maximum aperture is a little slow for light gathering ability.  With the fixed lens mount that makes it easy to add supplementary lenses and the large, but welcome, hand grip that doubles as the four AA-cell battery holder the camera is a little large and lumpy.  The memory card door is all plastic and feels flimsy.  Ejecting a memory card is extremely hard to do because of the limited space to put your fingers.  The tripod mount, while in the perfect spot for panoramic photographs, is located to the extreme side of the camera opposite the heavy batteries putting a lot of strain on the mount.  Nikon doesn�t give you rechargeable batteries or charger with it.  Nikon does give a quick start manual and supplies a reference manual on a CD (but I have yet to find the reference manual).

This Nikon Coolpix isn�t cutting edge technology.  Instead it is a well balanced, reliable machine with a perfect blend of functions to make it a versatile and enjoyable camera to use.  The camera is not a professional camera but in the right hands it has the potential to make great pictures.  Learn to appreciate the well thought out design of this camera and it will be a welcome photographic friend.
