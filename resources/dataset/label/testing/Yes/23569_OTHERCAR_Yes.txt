            I bought the Z71 because I have always had good luck with Chevy's.  It performs great on the highway as well as off road.  The seats are comfortable to sit in and it has good leg room.  The third door comes in handy when you have kids riding with you. It gets good gas mileage even for a 4x4.  We have had to lower end of the engine rebuilt at 50,700 miles because of part failure.  They have upgraded the door hinges but it comes a little too late for us.  We have had to repined them 2 times.  The 4x4 components went out and we had them replaced at low miles.  I wish anything that we had not experienced these problems because my faith in Chevy is diminishing.        <br><br>
