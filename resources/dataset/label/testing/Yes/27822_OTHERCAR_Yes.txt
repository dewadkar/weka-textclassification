<b>Fluff Chick Write Off:  Epinions "Fluff Chicks" Write About Guy Stuff</b>

Most of these writers are well-known for writing about "girly" items, such as beauty products, but have decided to express their creativity in a slightly different subject category!

This "Fluff Chick" also happens to be "Daddy's Little Girl."  And if there's anything that Daddy taught this little girl to appreciate, it's a sleek car.   I've been able to competently discuss the model variations between the 3 years of Classic Thunderbirds ('55 through '57) since I was in grade school.  Dad owns a '57.  For a while, our "family car" was a '66 Mustang.  My first car was a Camaro.  When the Camaro became "uncool," it was time for me to make my first real car purchase.  There was no doubt in this fluff-chick-car-girl's mind what she was going to buy....it was 1991 and I wanted a Miata!

The Mazda MX5, more commonly known as the Miata, was introduced in 1990.  I can still remember salivating over the first commercials in '89.  Even my dad, who's pretty much an American-car-only kind of guy, was impressed.  The Miata was most exciting because it was totally unique - a sleek, sporty, exciting convertible at a price that "real people" could afford.  Bye-bye Camaro...<b><i>HELLO, MIATA!</b></i>  

There were 63,434 Miatas produced in 1991.  The '91 Miata was available as Base, A Package, B Package, or Special Edition.  Features could not be added "ala carte" to a base model... packages were all or nothing scenarios.  The car I ultimately purchased was an A-Package Miata.  That is the model which I will be discussing and reviewing here.   More options were available for the B package.  In 1991, the first Special Edition Miata was also introduced.  

The MX5 packages essentially broke down like this:

<b>Base Model:</b> This one's basic indeed: Manual Steering, 14" steel wheels, no radio

<b>A Package:</b>  Power Steering, Leather Wrapped Steering Wheel, 14 inch Alloy Wheels, AM/FM Cassette w/Anti-theft

<b>B Package:</b>  A-Package plus Cruise Control, Power Windows, Headrest Speakers

<b>Special Edition:</b>  B-Package plus Tan interior trim and tan leather seats, Wood handbrake grip and Nardi shift knob, scuff plates, CD player, personalized interior badge

Factory options that could be added to the above packages were hardtops (in all colors except Metallic Silver), ABS (to B Package Only), Automatic Transmission, Air-conditioning

Colors available in 1991 were:

Classic Red
Mariner Blue
Crystal White
Silverstone Metallic
British Racing Green (Special Edition Only) 

As an A Package model, my car did not have the ABS option, but I did purchase the additional hard-top.  As a sports car purist, I stuck with the 5-speed manual transmission. I did not add air-conditioning - a choice which I later regretted!  Mine was Classic Red with a black interior, black cloth seats, a black vinyl soft top and a Classic Red hard-top. 

<b>Size and Comfort</b>

The Miata is a small two-seater that would probably be cramped and uncomfortable for anyone who is excessively tall.  I am 5'10" and was always comfortable in it.  At about 6'2", my dad said he felt like a tight fit behind the wheel.  The Miata sits very low to the ground.  This is great for a road-hugging drive, but presents a problem in the winter-time if snow gets too deep.  The bucket seats are soft and comfortable.  Throughout my college years, my best friend and I took many, many lengthy road trips in this car and we were very comfortable in it!

<b>Drive and Handling</b>

The ride in the MX5 is suprisingly smooth for a low-built sports car.  Handling is very precise with this car - much better than I had in the Camaro before this.  It hugs the road and corners nicely.  Miatas are rear-wheel drive vehicles.  I was a bit wary about the RWD, simply because I live in Ohio, and driving my rear-wheel drive Camaro on icy roads was about as treacherous an endeavor as I could imagine.  However, the Miata is a very well balanced car and I found that winter-time handling was actually quite good!  The manual transmission shifted easily and was very "quick" - this little car accelerated nicely and had quite a lot of pep!

<b>Structure and Durability</b>

A feature that I was afraid might eventually give me problems in this car was the pop-up headlights.  A friend who had these in a different model car had nothing but problems with them.  I am happy to report that I did not.  They functioned well, never jammed up and never froze shut, as I understand some are prone to do.

The clear plastic window in the soft top was another feature I was a bit worried about.  So often, the soft rear window in convertibles ends up wearing out and looking scuffed and opaque.  Mine never did.  It held up magnificently!  The hard top was lightweight and easily lifted and attached with two people of average strength.  It clamps down very simply.  I attached the hard-top for the duration of every winter and never had any problems with leakage or drafts - it made a nice tight seal with the body of the car.

The 4 cylinder engine was powerful enough to make this little car very responsive and perhaps more importantly, was maintenance-free.  I had this car for several years, put over a hundred thousand miles on it and never had to do anything but regular maintenance visits and oil changes.  This was certainly the most relieble car I ever owned.

<b>Electronics, Safety, and Economy</b>

I replaced the original radio in my car with a CD player a few years after I purchased it, so I cannot attest to the long-term durability of the factory installed radio, but it lasted well for the few years I had it.  The speakers were located in the doors and produced good sound - never tinny or garbled (the way the door speakers sound in my current car!)

The '91 Miata had a driver's side airbag, driver and passenger side interior lights, chrome-rimmed guages and an easily accessible fuse panel.  None of the electronic features of this car ever required maintenance of any kind.

I got excellent gas mileage in this car, both with highway and city driving.  My drive was usually an equal balance of highway and city, and I averaged about 30-32 miles per gallon.  Superb!

So why am I discussing my beloved little machine in the past tense?  Alas, the little darling was stolen a couple of years ago.  Apparently there are some car thieves out there who also appreciate the sleek appearance and superior handling of these little beauties.  For now I drive a somewhat more practical Honda Accord.  Would I buy another Miata?  You'd better believe it.  I'd buy it for a combination of reasons - some practical and some fluffy:  it's a reliable, sure-footed, and very dependable vehicle.  It's also cute as a button!  And in all probability, when I do make my next Miata purchase, I will find a nice 1990 or '91 model to buy used.  As the Miata continues to develop and change, these earliest models are destined to become classics.
