            Okay Hewlett Packard are not particularly known as a camera manufacturer, but we'll come onto that in a minute*...

This is a great wee camera for somebody who wants something easy to use, giving good pictures up to A4 size, with a reasonable zoom and reasonable movie mode.

It's also really hard to argue with the price.

I like this wee cam for its *pentax optics, straight forward control (it tends to use buttons rather than menu's, the LCD is communicative, and most major functions have a dedicated button on it's exterior).

It can be used straight out the box as a fully auto point n' shoot (probably how most folks will use it) although if you press the mode button on the top panel you get various programme & scene modes: these are self-timer, macro(close up), sports, landscape (infinity focus), and aperture priority at two set apertures (f2.8, the cameras fastest/widest and f8, the cameras sharpest/smallest).

If you are so inclined you can compensate the exposure from +2 to -2EV, you have a spot meter mode and the usual flash modes (no, always, auto-, reduced red-eye).

The resolution is controlled by the top panel, with three setings from e-mail quality (small file, so more on memory) small print (postcard & a5) and large print (up to A4, but using most memory).

THe White ballance can be set for tungsten, flourescent or daylight, with an auto-mode (default) if the term 'white ballance' means nothing to you.

The zoom lens gives an average range, equivalent to 38-115 on a normal film camera, again all most folk need.

It's not the most compact camera, but it does feel plenty solid.  It runs on double A batteries whichare readily availbale anywhere so you never need be without power.

The prints are vibrant & sharp with plenty of resolution available for home use, the movie mode, like on most digital cameras is adequate at best: if you want proper movies, buy a camcorder. 

Like most of these cameras it is really heavy on the juice, it will chew alkalines for breakfast, invest in a Nimh charger & four batteries and it'll pay for itself in a week.

There is no AV cable (surprising) but it comes with the USB & software (compatible with Win 98 on & Mac OS 8.6 0n).

You will also need to buy more memory, as it comes with a paltry 16mb, which at high res is simply not enough.
That said it's not any worse than what other cameras come with.
