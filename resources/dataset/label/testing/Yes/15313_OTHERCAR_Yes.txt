            I have been researching digital cameras recently, in preparation for my first digital camera purchase.  I finally decided on the Sony Mavica FD-83.  I have been very pleased with my decision thus far.

One feature of the Mavica that sets it apart from the others is that it uses floppy disks as film.  These are easy to find and inexpensive to purchase.  I just stick a floppy into the slot on the side of the camera and start taking pictures.  When I'm finished, I simply put the floppy into my computer's floppy drive and my pictures are there!  You don't have to hook the camera up to your computer for downloading pictures.

Another nice feature is the video recording capabilities.  You can record up to 60 seconds of live video, including sound.  This is nice for recording your kids to send to distant relatives.  This does take up a lot of space on your floppy, so be sure to have extras on hand if you plan to use this feature.

The rechargeable battery is good for up to 90 minutes.  When I first got the camera, I only had about 30 minutes on the battery and thought &quot;oh, no, that's not much time&quot;.  But after I recharged it the first time, it gave me 90 minutes and has done that each time I recharged again.  One nice thing is you have a countdown timer on the camera's LCD screen which tells you how much time you have left on your battery.  I would recommend buying an extra battery so you have a backup ready.

Setting up the camera is very easy.  I got it up and running without using the manual.  The back of the camera has several operation buttons which are very user friendly.  You have 3 choices when using the camera: still picture, video, or view pictures.  When viewing your pictures/video, you have the option of deleting the ones you don't want.  That way, you are not tying up space on your floppy with pictures you don't like anyway.  Deleting pictures is very easy to do with the on screen menu.

Some features of the camera that I have not used yet are the self timer function, which allows you to be in the picture, and the copy disk function, which allows you to copy your floppy onto another floppy right in the camera.  This is nice for giving copies to friends and relatives rather than having to email them later.

The camera is heavier than I had expected, but I quickly got used to it.  It's about the size of a manual 35 mm camera.  It came with a camera strap, but no bag.  I definitely am going to have to get a case for it.  Sony has an accessory kit which includes the case, another battery, cleaning cloth, and 3 floppy disks for around $60-70.  If you can afford it, go ahead and get that too.  The camera does not come with any floppy disks, so if you're excited about using it right away, make sure you have a few on hand.

Overall, I am pleased with the Mavica.  The picture quality is good and the camera is easy to use.  And I'm having a blast using it.<br><br>
