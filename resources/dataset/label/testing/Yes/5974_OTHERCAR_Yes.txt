            This is my first new car! I was stuck in traffic on the highway, in the dead of summer, coming home from work when I saw my first del sol.  As I was broiling in my own car, I made the decision that I would own one. Soon.
I became the proud owner of a dark green '97 Si that weekend, and I am still in love.  Quick, responsive, sexy, fun and reliable.  WHY WOULD YOU BUY ANYTHING ELSE?!?!?!  Oh, yeah, they were discontinued.
I have had mine for 3 years and I've only had to change the oil.  I have driven from NJ to FL and back twice, in comfort and I managed to get a tan in the process!
For anyone without kids who likes to drive, I would HIGHLY recommend this car.  If they still made them that would be all I ever owned.
