            I have 3 kids, one husband and lots of stuff that has to accompany us no matter where our destination is.  I hate those ugly, utilitarian minivans with lots of seats but no separate storage space.  This means that all your &quot;trunk&quot; things, i.e. windshield washer, motor oil, ice scrapers, are kept in the same compartment as the passengers - I have a problem with this.  What to do? Buy a Dodge Intrepid!  This is the best car I've ever owned - not only is it fabulous to drive with 215 HP, it looks awesome, especially in Inferno Red (worth the extra $175).  I easily fit THREE car seats in the back with room to spare and the trunk holds 5 suitcases plus beach gear.  The ride is smooth as silk and noise-free and
with the sun roof open, there is no better experience than a Sunday drive in the spring.  The ES comes with 8 way power seats, auto-stick, which turns the transmission manual with one gear shift (fun), upgraded CD stereo, leather wrapped steering wheel, power windows, locks and mirrors, and keyless entry.

Since I bought the car in May, I have yet to find any negatives.  If my kids are quiet I can almost believe I'm 21 again and out for a joyride!     <br><br>
