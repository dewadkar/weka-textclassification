            I was wary about giving up my SLR and moving into the Digital world. But I have learned that with a great camera (like the DC-280) and a good photo editor (like Photoshop) a semi-pro like me cna do just about anything. The only thing missing is the ability to mega-zoom, since you can't fit any different lenses on this camera. Also,  everything they say about battery life is true. Expect about 40 pictures per battery charge, and that is if you save juice by turning off the viewfinder and not turning the camera on and off too much. But these small gripes are made up for by the crisp, warm photos that you can take with this camera. Focus is clear, and colors are bright. Picture transfer (at least to a Mac) is a breeze, though a bit slow through the USB cable. I've heard that a card reader is quicker, but its all quicker than sending a roll of film out to be developed, so I can't complain about the few extra seconds. I've printed photos from this camera up to 8*10 and at that size pixels are just starting to show up. Any smaller, and its top-notch.<br><br>
