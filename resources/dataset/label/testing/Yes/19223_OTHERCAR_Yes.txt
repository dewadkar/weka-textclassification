            I wanted a camera to take on vacation in Italy. I was not looking for a camera with a lot of complicated features, just wanted it to be easy to use and take decent pictures. It also needed to be fairly compact so that it could be carried and gotten to easily. Although there are some very compact cameras out there, I ruled them out because they generally use odd sized batteries that could be hard to find or expensive.

This is my first digital camera and it worked out quite well on the trip. It uses 4 standard AA batteries, came with rechargeable ones and a charger. I found they would last a full day and I would charge them each night. The camera comes with a 8 Meg Compact Flash card which holds about 24 pictures at the standard resolution. Since I did not want to be worrying about losing flash cards while traveling, I bought a 64 Meg flash card which would hold well over 200 pictures (this cost me another $150). That may not seem like enough for a vacation, but since I could review the days pictures each night and delete any poor ones, it was plenty. One feature I liked was being able to change the ISO setting, which made it possible to get some very good pictures indoors without a flash (you can't use a flash in many museums and churches anyway). Using this and other features does require an extra step or two. I carried the camera in it's pouch on my belt and it was easy to get out quickly to use. The only problem that I had was that the camera takes a couple seconds before you can shoot, so you WILL miss some shots that you would have easily gotten with a regular camera. Also you cannot just snap the shutter as quickly as on a regular AF camera, it must be pressed fairly slowly (this may be true of other digital cameras, I don't know?). The USB interface was handy, although it says the software only supports Windows 98, it worked fine on my W2K machine. 

I would recommend this as a very good basic camera, suitable for travel if the flash card is upgraded. Definitely look on the web for the best prices!<br><br>
