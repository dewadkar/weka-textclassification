                 I am now the proud owner of a 2000 Honda Accord Coupe EX.  Ever since I saw the first one on the road in '98 (a red one-- WOW) I wanted one.  There aren't many times in life that you can buy what you WANT instead of what you NEED, but I figure since I'm single, 18, and will not have a need for four doors anytime soon, I BOUGHT IT.
     
     I decided that I actually wanted to own an Accord Coupe because it is classic-looking, yet sporty, 

     Let's start with the exterior.  I decided on silver 1) because black is too hard to keep clean 2) red attracts those evil ticket-givers and MUCH higher insurance for a girl my age and 3) white, green and blue look best on the sedans (just my opinion-- heck, the coupe may not even be available in those colors-- I'm really not sure!).  Since my aim was to look sporty, I looked for a coupe with a spoiler (without it, the coupe looks classy-- not quite as sporty).  The lines are sharp, and I happen to like the wedge-of-cheese look the Accord sports.  The sunroof is fun, and the dark tinted windows have a sly, important *look at me* appearance.

     Interior.  I love the layout of the controls-- very comfortable for me to reach while driving.  I don't have to shift my position in the seat to easily reach the air or stereo buttons.  The controls are also a little larger than most which make them easily accessible (especially the air conditioner temperature and speed dials).  The stereo quality is average (I'm comparing to my last car-- Maxima-- that had an AWESOME Bose system).  The maximum bass sounds a bit muddy, so I keep it on about medium.  The console is a little awkward.  By the time I move the seat up far enough for my short legs to reach the pedals, I can no longer comfortably rest my elbow on it.  Cabin noise is almost non-existent.  Honda was generous with the padding in the seats, and I seem to sink into them.  Very comfortable!!!  The simulated wood grain that trims the control panel and the area underneath the console is very nice, and gives the interior an expensive Acura look.  I opted for leather, and I love it.  It is soft, supple, and very easy to clean.  The carpet is soft and high quality-- but BLACK, and a little tough to keep clean (but I knew that when I bought it, so I shouldn't complain).  Okay, after all the reviews I've read on the Accord Coupe, all contain some complaint on the seating room.  IT'S A COUPE, NOT A SEDAN!!!  The coupe is really not a soccer mom car!  I do agree that the backseat can be a squeeze if a larger passenger is in front, so some strategic seating arrangements should be made.  

     The drive.  The car will do just about anything I want it to.  Suspension is great, sharp curves are a breeze, and braking is sensitive but gentle.  The ride is smooth, and you can just FEEL the eyes on you!!!  The transmission is solid-shifting, but smooth.  The 4-cylinder is just more economical for me-- a little cheaper than the V6, and much better gas mileage.  I don't expect my car to throw me into my seat during takeoff like the V6 is very capable of, but for 32 miles a gallon, I'll give it a few more seconds to get some speed!!!  Overall, guys, I totally recommend this car.  And it's a HONDA.  GREAT resale value, and you can drive the thing forever.
