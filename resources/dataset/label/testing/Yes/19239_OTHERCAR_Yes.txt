            My husband and I bought a 97 Dodge Intrepid about six months ago, and we absolutely love it.  I'm the primary driver of it, and the feel is very smooth.  The car is fairly quiet, and there's lots of leg room in this car, even in the back seat.  I drive this car a lot, since I commute an hour to work and back every day, and I feel very comfortable in it, even when the roads aren't ideal.  We have the Sport model, so this car even has an Autostick.  This enables you to drive the car as a standard, but without the clutch.  Believe me, this is very valuable when the roads are slick - I love being able to slow down the engine without ever touching the brake.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who wants a dependable car with lots of room (the trunk is huge too) and anyone with a family.  There's plenty of room for tall people in it too.
