               I bought this car a week ago after researching and test driving cars for 4 months. I traded in my 1999 Mustang. I was looking for a front wheel drive car (I live in Wisconsin) that was as sexy as my Mustang, that had things my Mustang didn't offer (moonroof, decent interior, hatchback, good seats). I got the 5 speed GT.
   Let's start with the good. This car is VERY attractive. I care a great deal about how my car looks. I've read EVERY review of the car on the internet. Even the reviewers that hadn't much good to say about the car (there's always a few), NOT ONE even dared to say this car wasn't HOT looking. The other cars in this category all have their likers and dis-likers, but the Tiburon opinion was unanimous.
   Next, the standard features for this car are irresistable. I won't list them, you can see that on Hyundai's website. Some of the reviews I read said that you could get a Celica or an Acura RSX for the same price, and recommended one of those. Let's compare apples to apples though. Compare the base 4-cylinder Tiburon with the base Celica's and RSX's, and you'll see a $4-5k difference. Same with the Tiburon GT 6-speed,vs. the RSX Type S and a loaded Celica GTS. I didn't want to spend more that $20k, so I had to pick from a base-model 140hp Celica, a base-model 160hp RSX, or a loaded-to-the-hilt Tiburon GT. Not a hard choice.
   The stock 17" rims (manual transmission GT only) and Michelin Pilot tires are just plain sweet. Keep in mind these are summer tires only. You'll need to spring for winter tires if you live in the snow belt.
   The warranty....enough said. I am a big fan of having a piece of mind. This scope of warranty is ~$1500 extra for other cars. With the Tiburon, your extended warranty is essentially free.
   The power. The engine is very smooth and torquey, and easy to drive fast. With the Toyota and Honda products you have little power unless you wind the berries out of the engine (RPM's). I like the easy, predictable power of the V-6 Tiburon. 
   Let's touch on the bad. The mileage isn't up to speed with it's competition, 26mpg highway. Variable valve timing would have been nice. This allows the engine to run with conservative, fuel efficient settings when just 'putt'ing around, then adjusts the fuel and valve operation to performance modes when the throttle is mashed.
   The paint isn't up to the other cars. The Mercury Cougar (and I'm sure others) blow this car away. Most people wouldn't notice this (I'm a picky paint-guy). It isn't as smooth of a gloss as the other cars. Looks kind of orange-peely or bumpy up close. Also, I saw a car in the showroom that had paint chipped on the rocker panel from people getting in and out. I kicked the rocker on my Mustang hundreds of times with my boots and never chipped the paint once(to be fair, maybe the Tib in the showroom got scraped with some of those steel lace-hooks like on hiking boots). Like I said, 99 people out of 100 wouldn't even see any of this.
   The body sheetmetal stampings are also marginal. If you stand near one of the tail-lights, and look down the profile of the lower door skin, you'll see small ripples from the imperfect stampings. This is also present at the door jambs, although to a much lesser degree. Once again, this is purely cosmetic, and most people would never see this. The only reason I saw this, is that I read a review that mentioned it. 
   Headroom is tight for people 6 foot and taller (I have a moonroof, and I understand this takes away from some of the headroom). I've gotten used to driving with the seat reclined a bit more than some are comfortable with, so this doesn't bother me so much (but I'm only 6 foot). Getting in and out is a bit tight too. Taller or wider people will almost always biff the side 'wing' of the seat when getting in. This mars up the seat a bit. Also, the gas pedal is very close to the brake pedal. I have big honkin' feet, and this annoys me. The last thing I need to do is apply the brake and throttle simultaneously. I wonder if these last three issues are from Korean engineers designing the car to suit the physiology of the Korean population base. Not a good idea if you want to sell cars in America.
   Torque steer is also fairly prevalent. However, I think I am somewhat biased to noticing this as I've almost always driven rear-wheel-drive cars. If you jump on the throttle, keep both hands on the steering wheel or you'll end up on somebody's front lawn.
   Here's the reason I didn't buy competing models:
RSX Type S, boring exterior, only 16" rims, expensive
Celica GTS, expensive, only 16" rims, very small-looking, no torque
Stratus R/T, cheap looking interior, not sporty enough
Eclipse GT, ugly boy-racer body-cladding, cheap interior
Cougar XR, low on power, last year of production

Don't get me wrong. I've listed alot of (small)gripes, but this car is great. I researched these cars for a long time to be sure I do not regret my purchase. The real deal-clincher for me (besides the super-hot looks) was the warranty. It made me look past the small aesthetic imperfections, and gave me confidence in the mechanical quality of the vehicle. If that does not give you the warm fuzzy feeling it gave me, get the Acura or the Toyota. You will not see stamping imperfections or marginal paint on those, just be prepared to pay more.
