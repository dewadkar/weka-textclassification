            Like many people today, I have become caught-up in the digital camera &quot;revolution&quot;.  It seems everyone around me has one or was about to buy one. I was a little late joining this revolution, but I did.

So, the tediously LONG and thorough research began.  I went everywhere digital; read everything digital; I was sinking in a sea of reviews, comparisons, and friendly advice from co-workers and associates.

In comes the Olympus D-490 Zoom.

I went to a local, very respected, photography store and spoke with the photographers there. They had everything from disposables to cameras (digital and &quot;regular&quot;) costing more than my car.  They all assessed my needs, wants, and budget and unanimously pointed me to the D-490 Zoom.

A little more than the D-460, but worth the extra $100, I was told.  Well, I bought it, a Smart Media Reader, and an extra 32MB Smart Media Card.  WOW, much more than I wanted to spend, but this seems to be the norm for electronic gizmos now-a-days.  I would suggest to anyone wanting to &quot;get in cheap&quot; that the little extras are basically mandatory if you want to enjoy the use of your &quot;low-end&quot; camera.  They call them low-end when you don't spend $800-$2000 dollars, then they are high-end - just shy of professional (which, of course, is anything over $2000).

First off, I really like the looks of this camera.  I know, it is what's on the inside that counts, but I don't like big, square, bulky cameras.  This one reminds me of a standard point-and-shoot film camera (non-SLR).

The controls are as easy to use and the digital extras are quite easy to understand.  The extras include a 2.5x digital zoom which I don't use because the 3x optical is plenty and looks great. Also, short QuickTime movies (without sound) are possible and look nice.

The image index and zoom/review mode is a very nice feature and has really come in handy on a number of occasions.  Though it does not playback the QuickTime movies - you can see the first frame only.

The batteries that came with the camera (non-rechargable) are still in it and I have shot well over 200 images and a few QuickTime movies!  Battery life is among the best in the digital camera world.  Even with the LCD on, which isn't really needed thanks to the viewfinder and &quot;older style&quot; LCD display on the top which tells you all the needed info.

It is simple, stylish, and takes the best quality images of cameras in it's range (and a little beyond).  The software bundle was as useful as any software bundle - it does the basics and that's about it.

The camera turns on by opening the sliding, attached lens cover (a big plus), but turns off by &quot;slightly&quot; closing it without hitting the lens, this then starts the lens retraction. Once the lens is fully retracted, then one finishes closing the cover.  It takes some practice and attention to NOT hit the extended lens while closing the cover (and the manual conveniently says not to hit it), though I haven't noticed any damage caused or problems occurring from bumping into the side of the lens.

The camera connects to a PC or MAC via SERIAL only - no USB.  Therefore, the purchase of a Smart Media Reader was mandatory if you do not want to take a short break every time you unload some images.

There is also a video-out cable that allows you to view images directly on your TV or other RCA-input video device.  Interesting and I am sure it's a hit at parties or something, but it's just as simple to use the full-color LCD to review images.  The manual recommends using the optional (not-included) A/C adapter if the video out is going to be used.

The D-490 Zoom only comes with an 8MB Smart Media card, so another higher capacity card was mandatory.  Let's face it, unless you are shooting only web/desktop pictures, 8MB will not go very far.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who has a budget that can accommodate the camera, a Smart Media Reader, and extra media.  This appears to be true for many so-called low-end cameras as well, so maybe Olympus isn't too far off the mark with the serial-only interface and tiny 8MB card.

The only reason one buys a camera, as it was pointed out to me, is for the quality of images. The Olympus D-490 Zoom takes fantastic pictures and I thought the images were comparable to some slightly higher-priced cameras.

This camera is idea for most people from novice to intermediate.  Even the professional photographers I spoke with love this camera for everyday shooting - that says something to me.
