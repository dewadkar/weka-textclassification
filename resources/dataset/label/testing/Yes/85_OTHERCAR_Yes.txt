            The Mazda Miata that I owned was a 1992 Limited Edition model. This was actually a 1992 1/2 model where it featured the black exterior color for the first time along with tan leather interior which was also a first. I was completely drawn to this car due to this color combination that was never seen on a Miata before.
The Miata has given me year of pleasurable driving experience. While the 116 HP or 105 HP in my 1.6 liter automatic did make me wish for more power, the handling capabilities of this car made up for my anguish. The handling on this car is amazing. Able to corner as if on rails, the front engine/rear wheel drive layout along with the perfect 50/50 weight distribution enables the car to maintain itself under extreme driving conditions.
Part of the fun with the Miata is not only its handling but the experience of a top down driving. The top can be lifted and lowered comfortably if stepped outside the car but with some strength the driver can raise the roof from the inside with no problem. The only drawback in lowering the roof is that the plastic rear window must be unzipped before it can be lowered. There has been a few times when the roof was accidentally lowered without the window unzipped and this has led to a crease in the middle of the rear window:(
Don't look into getting this car if you require room for luggage.  Think of Miata as if there is no luggage space. The trunk is very minimal and some people may resort to taking out the spare tire and just keeping a can of tire fix instead. Removing the spare will increase the trunk but only slightly. Being a car audio freak that I was, I installed a 10 inch sub in the trunk with a sub box that I designed myself to incorporate it into the small trunk space.  While I was successful I had only enough space to put in a backpack.  Hope that gives you a better idea of the space limitations.
Overall this is a wannabe sports car.  While I do admit that it has the handling capabilities of a sports car, it lacks the power to be given the sports car title. Yes, it does look like a sports car and if that's what you are looking for this it the car to purchase. Manual transmission is also recommended. If I could go back, I would definitely have gotten a manual transmission instead of the automatic. While I am not complaining about the automatic transmission itself, (because it shifts smoothly and at the right time) but the manual transmission will give the Miata the full advantage of its handling capabilities and optimal acceleration.<br><br>
