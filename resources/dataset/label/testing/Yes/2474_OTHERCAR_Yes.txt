            I just purchased the Concorde LXI and I must say I'm really impressed so far. Very comfortable, spacious, handles well. Very quiet.  Although I would have preferred the 300M but it was not in the budget. Easy access, good MPG for a car this size. Gigantic trunk! I received the car with every possible extra except &quot;smoker's group&quot;.  I'm particularly impressed with the 'homelink' option. This opens and shuts my garage door.  There are 3 buttons, 1 opens/closes, the other opens the other garage door and I even programmed it to open my parents door. The sound system sounds fantastic with the Infinity speaker system and 4 CD changer. I would have preferred the radio to have that RDS system, it auto-programs stations when you are on vacation and far from your normal listening range. My mountaineer has that. The steering is very precise and seems the car can drive itself.  
A couple of drawbacks though, visibility is limited with the small rear window. Also it takes getting used to judging the front nose and the rear of the car. The left foot rest is too short which makes my left leg a bit short. Wish it had a good money change and tissue holders. Back doors do stick out quite a bit when you open the doors. No daytime driving lights or automatic head lights. I was surprised at this, even my Chevy Malibu which i traded in had those. 
In general I do recommend this car.  I will be updating this as I experience the car more. 

UPDATE - 5 months.
It's been about 5 months and I still like the Concorde. Service has been very good. The engine is running a little rough and i'm probably going to take it in for them to look at. Other than that I'm very happy with it. It is such a nice change from a SUV, my other car is a Mercury Mountaineer.

UPDATE - 11 MONTHS
I love this car even more than I did on the last update!  Still rides quiet and smooth. No problems at all other than the usual maintenance. My only problem with the car is that I put too many miles on it.  We have a SUV but I prefer the Concorde. Those who wrote that the front end is too low I have never had a problem or a bump.  If you are considering this car, then purchase it. My gas milage is still the same at almost a year after I purchased it. 22 miles per gallon for a car that has 225 hp!<br><br>
