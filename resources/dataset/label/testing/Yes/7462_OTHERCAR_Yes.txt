               With Pontiac's aggressive styling and powers plants the Grand Am has lived up to my expectations as a well rounded vehicle. Plenty of pep in the 3100 v-6 power plant,soon to be added the supercharged version(WOW!!),Great gas mileage, handling that is found only in more expensive sports cars and interior room to boot! All the interior controls are easy to reach from the diver or passenger position. The steering wheel radio controls (optional) make it even easier fro the drivers position. Awesome sound systems.
    Split folding seats in the rear make extra luggage easy to haul. You want safety? Note this Toyota..STANDARD 4 wheel anti lock brakes,nothing extra...STANDARD...dual air bags, A vehicle that's structure is built out of the strongest steel on the market today! 
   If you are looking for a vehicle in this size class, look no further. the Grand Am is a well built and designed automobile. Toyota can't even come close to this with the new Celica. Not enough power, room and can't get close to the price. Driving excitement is what Pontiac is all about...By the way, I sell Toyotas<br><br>
