            A few months ago, I bought a 1999 Eclipse Spyder.  It's what enthusiasts call a 2G DSM, for second generation Diamond Star Motor.  Overall, I think this is a great car.   Other vehicles I've test drove include the Mustang, Camaro and the 3G non-convertible Eclipses.  I never intended on buying a convertible, but it's a love at first sight sort of deal.  This is the kind of car that has a classic ring to it, a clean beautiful design that's meant to be drop topped.  

Compared to other cars, it sticks to the ground like nobody's business.  It doesn't have a fluffy suspension, but enough to soften the blows.  After buying the car I've been taking the roads less traveled, notably the ones with twists in them.  The ability to open up and see the sky adds much to the experience.  But more on that later.  On different occasions I've opened the car to see that every major structure in the car has been strengthened and cross braced.  It is obvious that Mitsubishi put a lot of thought into this convertible, and didn't simply hack off the top.  As a result, this car is stuff as a bathtub.  More importantly, it's a pleasure to drive.  Actually I've been trying to get this car to spin out, even in the rain, and I haven't been able to do it, this car is just too sticky!! 

I've been taking the twisty routes for the hell of it, like Highway 17, 84, 12, 170, etc.  I've been through Napa and Sonoma, Monterey, Half Moon Bay and other places.  And traveling with the top down zooming on the edges of cliffs is the bomb!  On the downside, the rear seats are a joke.  But if you keep it in mind that this car is a two seater, then consider the rear seats a luggage shelf.  And what trunk space?  The trunk is close to nonexistant.  But for a car meant to carry two, it is just about perfect. 

In terms of engine power, it uses the 2.4 liter Galant engine.  This means high reliability, and more power and torque than the Neon 2.0 that they use in the standard GS.  It is not upgradable to a Turbo, and engine mods are limited because of the Galant ancestry.  Off the line power is pretty good and depends on your ability to control the clutch, and you can spin the tires easily, more so in the wet.  The gears are smooth, and you can cruise in just about any gear, the drivetrain is that good.  The engine has a 8000rpm redline, and sounds cool as hell in the high end.  I've been tracking fuel mileage at 24 miles per gallon.  I've been able to get 35 miles per gallon on a twisty trip through Napa, somehow.  

Since this is northern California, it does get a little chilly, and the heater is actually designed pretty good, and keeps the cockpit HOT, even at night.  The interior dome light is moved to the rear view mirror and actually does a great job at lighting the interior.  The instruments are well laid out, although there are a few punch out panels unfilled making you wonder what is missing.  (Turns out that there is a rear wiper control and an undefined button which makes no sense on the convertible).  

Also on the interior, I think the &quot;premium&quot; Infinti system is a joke.  It's adequate for the most part, but as an audiophile I cringe when listening to the low level noise present in the system.  I pulled out the Infinti the second day I had the system and replaced everything with ADS and Alpine.  That's talk for another review.

Finally, this car is a looker.   It is a hot car, and they don't make them any more.  It has bulges and curves popping out everywhere.  With the top up, it looks pretty good, with the top down, it'll knock your socks off.  

On the convertible top.  It tends to pick up dandelion seeds especially when traveling through roads by fields.  The trick is use a vacuum cleaner to get it all off.  It's a pretty good top, no leaks, dry as a bone on the inside.  Doesn't leak in car washes.  In heavy rain, water will come in if you open the door!  The best part is the top dissapears with the push of a button in 10 seconds.  It comes back just as easily.

Pros Not in Any Particular Order
1.  The car is pretty darn sexy.  I got the car in arrest me red and it's the kind of car that you do a double take on.  It has a nice pug nose.
2.  The GS uses the 2.4 liter Galant engine.   This means higher reliability, and higher performance than the 2.0 liter Neon engine in the non-convertible.  
3.  There is as yet, no leaking even in a car wash.
4.  Superb handling.
5.  Dropping the top takes 10 seconds, a push of a button.
6.  Great engine note.

Cons Not in Any Particular Order
1.  Like all convertibles the porthole in the back is not enough for rear visibility.  (i.e. what visibility?)  Basically the high bubble butt on the Eclipse makes it a little difficult to see the occasional small child or pet as you're backing up.
2.  Since the GS uses the 2.4 liter Galant engine, modifications and upgrades are severely limited.
3.  The weatherstriping on the sides tends to squeak a little.
4.  The &quot;premium&quot; Infiniti sound system is adequate but not amazing, so if you're a sound buff it will necessitate replacement asap.
5.  The shift gates on the shifter are not as clean as I would like. 
6.  Trunk space. Lack of.<br><br>
