            This was my first new car and I am overly pleased with it.  When it was coming down to make a decision I couldn't decide between the Hyundai Tiburon, The Saturn SC, or this car.  

I test drove the SC but didn't like the way it handled, it felt like a family car instead of a sports car.  Also for the same features I got in my ZX2 would have cost me nearly double the price.

The Tiburon felt sluggish and it's stick was difficult to work.  It looked real flashy, but couldn't seem to perform.

Then I stepped into the ZX2.  It shifts easily and smoothly.  Steering is tight and precise.  Engine noise is slightly louder than the other two cars I test drove, but that fits nicely into making it feel like a sports car.  As for room, I've been able to fit three other full grown adults into the car with only mild complaints from them.  But this car isn't designed for car pooling, it's for fun.

To give this car the Escort title is stupid. It packs the sportier Z-Tech engine from the Contour which is also where it's transmission comes from.  The body is styled almost completely different from the other Escorts.  I love driving this car.  <br><br>
