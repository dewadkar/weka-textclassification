            I bought my 96 Ranger Xl Reg. Cab 4x4 as a leftover in Aug. 97. The truck fit the budget but came to find out the re-sale value was not there.  My truck included fog lights, 4wd, 5sp manual, 2.3l, alloys, light security system, and am/fm cassette... not much else.  Over the period of time I had it I realized it was under powered, especially on the highway.  The 2.3l has about 127 horsepower and at 70 mph is was pushing 3000 rpms. The truck would bog down on any type of grade in the road.  The mpg was not terrific considering it was a 4cyc.  Thank god it was a manual.  The engine had no problems, I had it for 48K miles.  I just traded it for a New 2001 Ford ranger supercab 4x4 (see that review).  The cab was small due to a regular cab, now the regular cabs have about 4 inches more--much needed.  The ride was smooth until about 2 months ago.  I had some shaking going on at 60 mph. I balanced the tires, which had plenty of tread but no success.  Not sure why it was happening and didnt really want to know cause I was trading it (Dealer never test drove it to realize the problem).  I tried to sell it for 6+ months but couldnt get below book value, and it was in perfect condition (shaking wasnt happening either, then).  I finally traded it for 7100 which I thought was great since that is what I owed.  The book retail was almost 10k.  Unfortunately it didn't have any selling features, a/c, auto, power, etc.  The best thing I will miss is the long bed, rare to find.  This truck could hold more than a F150.  The styling of the truck was basic, but was all metal!!! No plastic bumpers like you see now (see review of Nissan Frontier).  The 96 came without tow hooks in the front which were much needed.  The truck did very well off rd, never got stuck or gave troubles.  The truck was lite so it was alittle tricky to handle in snow.  The 4wd system was manual, you needed to get out and switch the hubs and put the shifter in 4h on the floor.  The truck developed rattles and squeaks the older it got.  Started to be annoying but as you can see, I have faith in Ford.  Ford does give you alot for your money.  I bought the truck for 13K, listed for about 16K then.  The seats were finally improved in 2001.  My seats were flat and not to comfortable which I have read from other epinions.  The other compliant was I had to replace my front brakes at 40K which is very early.  It cost $450 which was a true sacrifice at 40k miles.  It could have been because it was a leftover and sat for so long, of course Ford denied that.  I also had to replace a broken fog light lense, which was not cheap either ($100).  You can't just replace the bulb, you have to replace the whole thing.  Nobody had a spare part so I had to buy direct from Ford.  The instrument panel has never changed and is eye pleasing with all controls easy to reach.  The stereo was very user friendly.  I had only 1 recall, for the Ford wipers=common problem. The truck was reliable and did what it had to do.  It was my work horse for the house work.  The resale value bothered my because after almost 3 yrs I had no equity.  I would understand if I had bought it at msrp but for 3k under, I dont know.  Im glad to be in a new one.  My suggestions are to buy equipped and buy a v6.  Most ford owners can get easily over 140k miles on a ranger without many problems.  I hoped I helped you in my thoughts and opinions on the 96 ford ranger.  <br><br>
