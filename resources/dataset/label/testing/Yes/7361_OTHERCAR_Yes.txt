            <b>Subaru</b> has offered many interesting vehicles in the past, the infamous 'Brat' and odd looking 'SVX' to name a few. Interesting is one thing, exciting is another. While many of these Subaru's boasted interesting looks, Subaru has repeatedly ignored the publics' cravings for large amounts of raw power and outrageous 0-60 times times; until now. The Subaru WRX offers superior performance characteristics than any 'production' Subaru sold in America in the past and current, even the late, great <a href="/content_50222960260"> SVX</a>. While the price may be close to what you would pay for a base model BMW, the WRX wagon boasts some of the best performance bang in the current automotive market.

<b>For the 2002 Model line-up</b>, the Impreza comes in a few base trim lines, and the top of the line WRX trim lines being the most noticed and desired out of the bunch. The WRX comes available in either a 4 door sedan or 4 door wagon (tester). Both styled WRX's come with the same meaty 227 horsepower turbocharged DOHC 16 valve flat 4-cylinder engine while the other trims come with a 2.5 4-banger that pumps out an adequate 165 HP. Transmissions include a precise shifting 5-speed manual transmission (tester equipped), and an optional (almost $1,000) 4-speed automatic transmission.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

When you settle yourself behind the MOMO brand steering wheel, into the very supportive sport bucket seats, and resting your feet on the aluminum pedals, there is no doubt you are about to drive a performance biased vehicle. While the WRX may look a little plain inside and out, it's not until you actually drive this car that you see why this wagon has received such rave reviews. 

Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is amazing, especially for the relatively mere (compared to an S4) 227 horsepower provided. With the thought of 227 horsepower moving a 3,200 lb vehicle I would not have expected such swift acceleration, that is if it weren't for the millions of ADs boasting that this car does 0-60 in less than 6 seconds. On hard take-offs the tires spin very little, and torque steer in eliminated thanks to Subaru's genius AWD system. Unlike cars that are just FWD, this sort of power and torque does not affect acceleration due to severe torque steer, and front tires that refuse to grip, i.e. the Mitsubishi Eclipse Gs-T. The shifter is located in a perfect position, and allows for precise shifting to get the most out of this turbocharged 2.0 liter 4-cylinder. But what about tubro lag? I experienced very little if any. As another reviewer here at Epinions noted, I noticed little or no turbo lag whatsoever, just clean, refined acceleration that never gave up in any gear. Even though the WRX has great low RPM acceleration, it's from 3,000-7,000 RPM where this car really shows what it's made of.

Besides being extremely fast, this car is also a handling champ.
<b>Handling</b> in the 2002 Subaru WRX wagon was no surprise. With AWD one can usually expect good, confident, balanced handling through the twistys. Body lean/ body roll, etc. are kept to a minimum. The low profile performance tires (P205/55/R16s) help grip even further. This AWD set-up allows for some of the most enjoyable/fun rides through the twistys this side of the $30,000 circuit.


<b>Cruising</b> in the 2002 Subaru WRX wagon is also one of this car's strong offerings. Unlike many 4-cylinder powered vehicles, engine noise can hardly be heard while cruising conservatively at 65-70 MPH. Roadgrain and wind noise are also isolated.  The ride remains composed at almost any speed, and the AWD aids in this department. Under full throttle the engine/exhaust does get loud, but this noise fits perfectly with the performance and overall attitude of this wagon. Another uncommon 4-cylinder characteristic is this car's hill climbing ability. Even up the steepest inclines (7%-10% grades) this car can tackle hills at 65-70 MPH with no need to down-shift into lower gears, although a down-shift into 4th does indeed give much better acceleration up those steep mountain roads, however it's not necessary as with most 4-cylinder powered cars.

<b>Braking</b> in the 2002 Subaru WRX wagon is excellent. Despite the rotors already being thrashed by other test drivers, the car's 4-wheel discs coupled with 4-wheel ABS made for extremely good braking with no fade whatsoever. 

<b>Fuel Economy</b> is average, but for a small turbocharged 4-cylinder is a bit disappointing. The EPA is rated at 20/27 which is about what a 5.7 liter, 400 horse powered  Z06  Chevrolet Corvette receives.

<b>Note:</b> Subaru offers many packages to further great handling. <a href="/content_67772321412"> WWW.CARS.COM</a> or WWW.SUBARU.COM has more info.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the 2002 WRX wagon is mostly a mix of positive attributes, yet like most cars does have its negatives. The plastics in the cabin seem sturdy, unlike what Nissan produces for the interior appliques of Sentra Spec-V/ Nissan Altima 3.5 SE. The drivers position is excellent, as the large instrument cluster is easy to read, rear vision is excellent, ergonomics are almost perfect as are the HVAC controls. A grippy, leather wrapped MOMO steering wheel awaits you upon entry. This steering wheel is an excellent addition to this car's interior, however the tilt steering system does not allow it to fully recline up, so it only can be adjusted upwards to where most steering wheels sit without a tilt feature. Being 5'6" this meant that I had to move my seat back in-order for my knees to be a safe distance from the steering wheel. The dash doesn't exactly look sporty, but Subaru uses a good amount of titanium accents without an overdose as many cars frequently do with this titanium theme or the popular simulated wood theme. Standard amenities are plentiful, an 80 watt excellent sounding 6-disc in dash stereo system with 6 speakers , aluminum pedals, dual front and dual side air bags, AC, cruise control, (note: The cruise control is a little annoying to operate, as you have to push a cruise button to your left on the dash, and then use the controls on the steering wheel), power windows and door locks, power mirrors, cup holders, stylish WRX embroidered floor mats, a huge glove box, a digital clock, and keyless entry. Even though the WRX comes very well equipped with just standard equipment, there is a good amount of optional equipment and packages for this car, <b>www.cars.com</b> has more info. The WRX's seats offer tons of support and comfort. While 'looking' like seats that came out of a Dodge Neon, or any other economy car for that matter, these manually adjusted cloth seats are so comfy and supportive that the cheesy blue/ black design becomes irrelevant. These seats also offer excellent bolstering for aggressive driving. Larger people might have a problem with these seats as the bolsters might cause some comfort problems. Room and storage are adequate, but not great. There is plenty of leg and head room for front passengers, but rear leg room is a little tight. The WRX wagon has rear split folding bench seats that make for decent storage for camping trips etc..

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

The <b>exterior</b> of the WRX wagon is not exactly what you would imagine a car that does 0-60 in 5.6 seconds (according to specs) to look like. The Subaru WRX wagon is anything but sporty looking. Despite boasting a hood scoop, large fog lights, an open mouthed bumper, ground effects, an optional spoiler, 16" aluminum wheels, and wide tires to segregate it from lesser trim lines, the Subaru WRX still looks every part of a grocery getter like wagon. The 3 letter, now famous, insignia 'WRX' plastered on the rear hatch also separates this wagon from lower trim lines, however this 3 letter code is not enough to muster any sort of excitement to anyone who has not driven this understated wagon.


<b>Note:</b> There are many optional body kits you can buy to make this sporty wagon even sportier.

<i>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</i> 

The price on my tester, which included just standard equipment, and an optional spoiler had a sticker of almost 25K. Is this a good price? Well the Acura Integra Type R back in 1998 was almost the same price, yet only came with a naturally aspirated 4-cylinder, was slower, did not have AWD, and had nowhere near as much standard equipment, so yes, the WRX wagon represents an awesome value. It's a little to early to comment on reliability, however I forecast this car to be like the majority of Subaru's which are usually very reliable. <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b> might have some info on recalls, etc. If anything does happen to your 2002 Subaru WRX wagon, Subaru offers a 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty with roadside assistance, and a 5 year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.
