<TEXT>
            I bought my 98 S70, hoping I would love it. Well, I don't.  I like it, but I'm not passionate about it.  I have a bad back, and in my Maxima, which I did love, my back usually hurt.  Well the seats in the Volvo are phenomenal.  Comfortable beyond compare.  It's also quick.  I've got the T5, which has great acceleration at high RPMs, nice for passing cars and getting on the highway, just not real quick off the line.  It handles well, and I love the solid, safe feel of it.  It rides hard, which is ok, except when I hit that occasional pot hole, when my teeth rattle.  I had some problems with the stereo off and on for the first 4 months or so, one speaker would sound blown, then fix itself, then the other.  Never did anything about it, and its been fine for a year (and I tend to turn it up with alot of base now and then) Also had a problem with the right blinker socket, seemed to be failing, and the dealer fixed it on the spot (22,000 miles) and said this is a problem.  Other than that the car has been fine. <br><br>
