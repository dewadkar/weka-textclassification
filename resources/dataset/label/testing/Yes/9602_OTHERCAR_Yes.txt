            Among those under constraint of economy, in need of a car, and have no desire/ability to work under metallic tubing, Civic and Celica are two foremost candidates--if you have no objection to Japanese cars.

SIMILARITY
Both car tends to the small bug type, with lots of modification options, from the &quot;flamboyant&quot; to the &quot;polished&quot; look (usually from $2-3K)

COMPARISON

--Civic (Coupe)--
Price: $12-20K
Horsepower: 115-127 (1.6L)
Fuel economy: 24/32 MPG
Advantage: Civic offers a wide permutation of Civic, tailored to a wide variety of buyers (Celica family have only GT and GTS). The handle is moderately good, as is acceleration. The chassis is a classy, with a modern beveling. The interior is less &quot;ultra-modern&quot; than Celica's, and is usually preferred over Celica's.

--Celica--
Price: $16-23K
Horsepower: 140-80 (1.8L)
Fuel economy: 24/33 MPG
Advantage: Celica has a great handling, acceleration, and a nice unique look (granted, aesthetic is highly subjective).

Upshot, if you want a better driving experience; Celica. If you want a well balanced car; Civic.

P.S. All comments are welcome. I'll keep updating this review whenever I can.
