            I currently drive around in a '97 Nissan Sentra GXE.  I'd be lying if I said it was the greatest car I've ever driven, but it's definately not bad.

It seats 4 people comfortably.  The front two seats provide plenty of leg and head room (for most people, anyway).  The back seat has pretty limited leg room, but I tend to drive with the driver's seat in the furthest rearward position.  Longest road trip I've taken with the car has been around 7 hours with 2 passengers, and I didn't hear any complaints about lack of space.

Gas mileage is good, I average around 26-27 mpg with mainly city driving.  The car compensates for this by having a relatively lazy engine (a 1.6L 115HP DOHC 4-cyl), and if you're looking at buying a Sentra, I'd definately go for the SE/240SX versions with the 2.0L engine, which gives you 25 extra HP (I believe the 2001 Nissans will have this engine standard).  However, the engine does it's job well, and seems to be comfortable cruising at 75-80 mph, and acceleration is acceptable, but don't expect 300ZX performance.

The trunk is pretty big, unfortunately the opening is a little small.  So while there's enough room to fit a large box, it's nearly impossible to actually get it in there.  It's difficult to fit large items in the back seats as well for a similar reason, the doors don't open enough (their open enough for people to get in easily, though).

The car are has been very reliable these three years, although the car only has around 42k miles on it so possible long term problems haven't surfaced yet.

One problem with the car is that there's alot of road and air noise.  At around 70, I find myself turning the stereo up significantly in order to still hear it above the din.  The car also has a couple of annoying squeaks, especially in the front passenger area.  If you plan on buying a high powered stereo and speakers, know that the door moldings tend to shudder on high bass notes, which gets annoying.

All in all, I have no problem recommending this car to anyone.  It's served me well through my college career, and will likely serve me well for a few more years and I save up for a bigger car.  This is a great car for people in high school and college especially as it's reliability lets you not worry about it as much.<br><br>
