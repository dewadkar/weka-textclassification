            When I bought this car it was great for my husband and me. It gets wonderful gas milage. 300 miles per tank!!! We paid about 20,000 for this car. It comes with a lot of safety features and it is dent resistent up to five miles an hour. It really prevents those parking lots dents. The seats are comfortable and the ride is smooth. Outside noise is low. It handles well on the road. th back seat has no room. It is very uncomfortable for passengers. But the trunk makes up for the back seat. It has tons of room. the back seat is difficult to fit a car seat in. Putting my son in and out is a nightmare. There just isn't enough room.
This is a great car for a single person or a couple without children.<br><br>
