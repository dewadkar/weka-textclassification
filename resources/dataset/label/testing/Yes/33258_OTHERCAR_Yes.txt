              This truck was one of the lowest priced in it's class, that was the main reason I was attracted. The truck really has a lot going for it as far as the price paid. It has a comfortable interior and the truck drives well. I really like the interior and the dash, it's very attractive. The extended cab adds a little bit more room to a roomy truck. I got the aluminum wheels on the Frontier and they look a lot better than the old style chrome wheels on the Nissan trucks. The 4 cylinder engine provides enough acceleration under most circumstances. 

  The only dislikes I have about the truck are very insignificant. I couldn't get cruise control and the floorboard is a little cramped. Other than these minor problems, I really feel that I have gotten a nice truck! This is my second Nissan owned and they make good trucks! If you are in search of a low buck truck, this is the ride! <br><br>
