            I bought my 1991 Ford Probe in 1992 after having an accident. A careless driver ran a stop sign and totaled my car, leaving me to find something quickly. The insurance settlement from the accident would have enabled me to buy something more expensive, but I opted to spend some of the money paying off a credit card and the rest on a car. I have never regretted that decision.

My Probe currently has almost 130,000 miles on it and is still going strong. I have had to do my share of maintenance, but I am careful to do such. I get regular tune ups and oil changes and keep an eye on things in case a problem does arise. So far, I've been lucky. I have replaced the muffler, assorted belts and hoses, and brake pads in the 8 years I've had this car. It has been reliable and safe for me and my family.

One of the things I noticed right away driving this car was that everything was at my fingertips. The turn signal was small and just a pinky stretch away from the wheel. This was different from any cars I had driven before, but I liked it. I also liked the placement of the wipers and lights. Everything just seemed to be in the &quot;right&quot; place. 

Having said how much I've liked my car, I will say there are a few things I haven't loved. While the trunk is surprisingly roomy, there is virtually no storage space inside the car. The glove compartment could barely hold a pair of gloves let alone a map, sunglasses, or a pack of gum. There is a tiny compartment between the front seats, but things easily fall down into the crease and are lost forever. Stinks when you need money quickly for toll roads. There is also no cup holder at all - definitely not good for a coffee lover such as myself.

There was a recall on my seat belt that had to be replaced in 1996. It was done free of charge, but required my car be in the shop for two days. If you buy one of these cars used, ask for documentation that this work has been done. Otherwise, your shoulder belt will not work properly. These cars do not have air bags in them, so you really need that belt to work. Safety first! :)

The 91 Ford Probe is a sporty little car, but I have found it is definitely not an ideal family car. When I purchased the vehicle, I was childless. I am 5'8 and it is a great sized car for me. Small, but not too small. My husband cannot drive it because he is 6'4 and simply too tall. Even with the driver's seat pushed all the way back, his head hits the roof and his knees are cramped. I personally like the feel of a small car, but like I said it is not ideal when you are tall. The small interior also posed a problem for my children. Since this car is only a 2-door, it is a real pain to move the seats and get your baby in the back. I would have to say that has been my least favorite thing about this car. It is easy to bump the baby's head when maneuvering him in such a small area. Luckily, both my sons are old enough to climb into their seats by themselves, but I have had my share of sore back from all the work involved in getting them settled each time they get in. Once they are in place, there is virtually no leg room even for someone in a car seat. I cannot imagine an adult trying to sit back there.  Often times I'll feel my oldest (4 1/2) kicking the back of the driver's seat because he can't stretch out.

Other than the size issues for my family, overall I've enjoyed this car. Of course now that I have two car seats in the back and travel most everywhere with my children as a stay-home mother, I doubt I'll shed any tears when I trade in my Probe this year for something roomier. It certainly gets me from point A to point B and has done everything I expected of it. I feel safe driving it and will continue to rely on it for another few months before we make a trip to the dealership. I feel overall it is still a good car  - just better for a petite person driving alone. :)

I paid roughly $6000 for the car 8 years ago. I'm sure the trade in will not be much, but I feel I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of it. Despite the set backs now that my needs have changed, this car has been good to me and I would purchase another Ford product again.
