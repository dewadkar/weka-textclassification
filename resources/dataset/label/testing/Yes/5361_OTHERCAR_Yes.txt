            When deciding on a vehicle nearly 3 years ago I never thought I'd be sitting behind the wheel of a BMW convertible.

But as luck would have it, I was able to find one in my price range.

My car is the 6-cylinder version, with leather tan seats on black exterior.  

1995 was the last year they used the 2.5 liter engine.  In 1996 they switched to the 2.8.  I had the opportunity to drive a 1996 and found it to have much better torque.  Bottom end was amazing, easily outpaced my car 0-60 no problem.  But if that isn't a major concern for you, don't worry about it.

The seat warmer is really my only complaint.  They are known to give out after a few years and replacement is very costly, so I didn't even bother.  Also the stereo could use improvement in output, but I notice the system in 1996 is much better, also the same year they changed to electronic climate control.

This car is a great head-turner.  There is nothing better than cruising on a summer's day with the top down.  Not only that, but it handles like a dream.  Very tight around the corners and at high speeds is where it shows it's true colours.

Also for winter driving it was amazing.  With an equal 50-50 weight distribution this car handled snow and ice without hesitation.
