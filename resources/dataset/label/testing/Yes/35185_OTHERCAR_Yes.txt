            History 

Winter was approaching. My BMW 750il (more info see my �98 BMW 7 review, as I compare all cars/trucks I own/owned to it) and �82 BMW 633CSi are not winter cars. I needed a car for winter as the northeast winter can be as mild as a few dustings or as severe as an all out blizzard. The �Range,� as I call it, was not really my first choice. To tell the truth, I never really looked at trucks and wasn�t to familiar so I had no choices. My good friend loves Landrover as much as I love BMW and Ferrari, and told me to get a Landrover. I was hesitant. Landrover? I heard of them, but didn�t know too much about them. Besides, BMW made an SUV (SAV really), so why do I need to even look at these things? Well, he told me BMW owned them for the last couple of years, so I was interested. Looking around, a local dealer who specializes in pre-owned highline European cars (my favorite) had a �98 HSE, which has the bigger 4.6L engine, with 22,000mi for only $37,000. Following my �buy � years later for nearly half the price� principle, I was hooked. And bought it, white on black leather. 

Later that month, I was just randomly looking up rap songs to download on the net when I can across �Bootee� by Benzino. I thought that it was a funny spelling of bootie and continued looking at songs. I then got an important message and left the computer. It turned out that when I clicked to see the info on the song, I double clicked and downloaded the song. My mistake. But it turned out to be the theme song for the Rangerover. Unlike all the rap songs with the Cadillac Escalade, this ones about the Rangerover!  It was a good song, as far as rap goes. But the chorus is what is great about it. �Ridin through the streets in my Range�� is how it starts, and it repeats over and over again near the end of the song. Which is just straight cool! I got my great truck, and now I got a great theme song for it!
 
Exterior 

The exterior of the truck is simple, elegant, understated, and refined. To many casual observers it looks like an early nineties Ford truck. This is true to a degree, but on a closer look the Range really is much more elegant and refined, not to mention sporting excellent fit and finish. 

At first, I didn�t like the exterior design, but it really grows on you. The optional brush guards gives that rugged look, as well as offer good protection to the lights against the occasional �brush.� It�s a problem that is more pronounced in this truck than others because it is really, really wide. Not crazy wide like a Hummer, but still wide (and the handling reminds you of this with every turn of the wheel.)

Also notable, the 18 inch wheels (opt. on SE version, standard on HSE) are tasteful and look really nice. They are big, but not unwieldy. Unlike 19 or 20 (or even 22) inch wheels, the 18 inch wheels give both tasteful size and performance. I can run over anything and not worry about rim damage.  
 
Interior/Comfort 

The seats are comfortable and supportive. They have numerous different adjustments including the important lumbar support for long trip comfort. They also offer heating for the front seats. The rear seats are comfortable, but not great. Legroom is ample for the front seats, though the rear seat legroom is merely acceptable.    

The general trim is nice, though �underdeveloped.� The wood placement and selection is pleasant to the eyes and doesn�t denote the plastic feel of Mercedes interiors, but is less than BMW standards. For a flagship model and trim, stitched leather should be more prevalent.  

The cargo room is ample, but the best feature is way it opens. One big button, press it once and the glass is opens up, press it again and the tail opens down. What makes is great is that you don�t need to press the button and pull the tail gate down at the same time, rather just press the button and then pull it down. What this means is that if you have on hand full, the other is more than enough to open the trunk, which is nice. Sure it would be nice if it was power, but still it is really nice. 

Features/Amenities 

As far as general/common features go, the cup holder is ok, but not strong enough to hold a really big drink. The buttons are like Mercedes buttons, big and ugly. I like BMW buttons, they are small but not too small, while Mercedes seems to like buttons that are easy to quickly hit even if you are old and unsteady. Personally, the BMW size buttons are just fine for me. Sadly, the trend today seems toward bigger buttons. 

The radio is a German HK sound system. You can tell that they simply put a HK deck into the truck, as the style of the deck is completely different from the rest of the truck. The sound system is very good, with the subwoofer on high and the treble on moderate, it sounds simply amazing. And since the doors are not vault doors like BMWs or Mercedes, you hear it outside the truck (making blasting �Bootee� even better). You really feel the pulse as it bangs. The only thing I ask for is more/better treble control, as its often too much or too little, with little in between.  

Climate control is dual selectable, and works very well. Though the AC control is backwards. The AC button is not an AC on button; it is an AC off button. I thought the little �off� under the AC meant press on for on, press again for off. Boy was I wrong, and I sure felt the heat until I figured it out. You press it to turn the AC off, meaning its always on or comes on automatically when its hot. But the best part is the automatic defogger. No thinking press defogger and increase the heat or decrease the heat to compensate, but rather simply press is and its done. It instantly defogs. Simply wonderful.     

A nice feature is the onboard computer, which works the same way as the one on BMWs. Press the button and the computer cycles through range, average speed etc. Also nice is the on steering wheel controls which control not only volume and tuning, but mode as well, allowing quick CD to radio switches. Only problem is that they are not light supported, so at night you have to go buy feel to find the buttons. Also nice would be a GPS, but this was rectified in the later years. 

By far the coolest feature is the ride control. The air suspension moves up and down, and it is nearly dummy proof. With a press of a button, the height of truck is nearly that of a car, allowing very easy access. Press up, or just start driving, the suspension will start to go up to normal height. Crusin� on the highway? The Range will lower slightly for increased stability. Press up and you go up for off-roading fun. 

Finally the shifter, truly a truck wonder. All trucks should have this �H� shifter. It has 4 modes: Regular Automatic, Sport Automatic, Off-road Automatic, and Automatic-based Clutchless Manual. Although Sport Auto is tempting, it�s not suggested, as gas mileage falls from really, really bad to unspeakably evil.
 
Performance/Ride/Fun 

The ride is comfortable, though it could be a lot softer. A variable suspension that shifts from firm to soft like a BMW would be nice. The overall performance is adequate, But the engine needs more power. Also the actual �performance� is really poor, as the engine has remained essentially unchanged since it was introduced back in the 60s (yup 60s!). As a result, the gas mileage is dismal. I averaged 12.7 mpg (as told by the computer) from relatively conservative driving. To put this in perspective, my 5.4L V12 still manages 14 mpg under pure sort driving(I see redline more often then I change CD tracks ^_^)  

Handling is poor, to say the least. My dad�s Explorer handles better, but has lower traction. That said, my range rover stuck to the road very well for a truck. 
 
All that said, fun was the fact that you could drive over anything. My most memorable experience was when the weather was horrible and snowy. I was stuck in non-moving traffic one exist behind mine. In the slow lane I noticed that there was a road to my right, one not too far off from where I was going. Well between me and the road was about 200ft of snow covered grass which was about 5 to 10 feet down (the roads were built on a slight hill). After not moving for a few minutes, and starting to get late, I said, in essence, �---- it.� And turned off the road and through the little hill and snow. Not being completely stupid, I first increased the ride height to off road (you can only go 25 miles in high mode before it kicks you down automatically for safety). Then I went over on my H shifter to Off-road driving. When the gears all set and the light saying the mode was switching was over, I went. All that I have to say is that I wasn�t late. 

Maintenance/Reliability 

I changed the oil every 3500 miles to be overly protective ^_^ but the Range had given me no trouble. It was great. Reliability is just amazing considering how many earlier landrovers where plagued with problems. BMW ownership definitely improved the quality. We�ll now see if Ford can keep it up. 

Final Thoughts 

I really liked my Rangerover. Sure it wasn�t perfect, but interestingly nearly all of the problems and shortcomings where addressed by BMW in the new Rangerover (power, handling, comfort, interior design, etc). Simple example, BMW dropped a smaller V8 in that gets much better gas mileage and over 60 more horsepower. I only wish BMW didn�t sell the brand to Ford. Not that I have anything against Ford, but I really like Landrovers and wish they were part of the BMW family. Also, quite sadly, the once proposed 5.4L V12 Rangerover, using the same engine as the BMW 750iL, is now just a memory. 

It is truly the king of all SUVs, and the new BMW version will solidify that claim. There is no other 1998 truck I would rather have. 

Just a note, I use past tense sometimes for a reason; after nearly 8 months of great times, I had to trade my Rangerover in back in late April when I got my NSX (see my �97 NSX review). I�m still looking for its theme song�
