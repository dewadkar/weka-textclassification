            Hello!

Well, after my little college car finally gave up and heaved its last gasp, I guess it was time to go and get another car!  I hate shopping for a new car.  The hassle of going to the dealer and haggling the best price/deal, the paperwork after and so on and so on.

I looked at various models that I thought I might like.  The Lexus GS 300 and 430 were a serious consideration and took both out for a test drive.  They were very fun to drive.  Acceleration, handling and all that stuff was entertaining but something was missing.  For me, it felt a little generic.  Not that a Lexus is generic by any means, it just felt that way to me.  I also thought about a BMW, but said �Nah� pretty quickly.  I am just not a Bimmer kind of guy.  

I wanted modest luxury with a touch of sport in it.  To me, the Lexus and BMW focused a lot on the sport aspect, which is fine for others but not for me.  I can�t see myself speeding down the freeway zipping in and out of traffic or gunning my engine to get other people to race with me.   My daily commute consists of a 10-mile drive on a fairly congested Southern California freeway!  My top speed rarely exceeds 15 MPH!   But I did want something with a touch of sport just for those rare moments where I can speed along at 45 MPH!!! Whoohoo!

I decided on the Mercedes CLK.  It was cute without being gaudy. It was modestly quick with a peppy engine and it had the creature comforts that made a one-hour commute feel like a 10-minute cruise.

Yes, one could go on about compression and lateral acceleration but, but for me; I just wanted a nice mode of transportation.  It can get a little boring reading about someone�s limited test drive at the dealer or my friend�s dad�s neighbor having one.   

So I had to wait a little for my car.  Apparently, these little cars are in big demand where I live but I can see why.  

When I got my car, and turned the key, the first thing I noticed was a mild throaty idle.  Not overly noisy like some little putt-putts that try to make their cars sound like a formula one car with weird exhaust configurations.  I get in and sit down, adjust the mirrors and seats and whatever there are to adjust.  Thank goodness that once you set everything, hit the seat memory key and voila, you never have to do it again.  What is user friendly also, is that the passenger seat has the memory function as well.

There are endless gizmos that one could add onto the car.  I just wanted a nice commute car.  I did not need xenon headlights and the headlight washer system that comes with it.  Nor did I did get the GPS navigation.  If I can not find my workplace by now, I don�t think a GPS is going to help.  Also, on our weekend trips to Las Vegas or the Napa Valley, we take my wife�s car, which is a very comfortable sedan with a GPS.  I will comment on the Mercedes CLK ride later.

The creature comforts include dual climate control and power everything.  This is all I really need, in fact, some features I didn�t want, like a power headrest.   Everybody has different wants and needs.  Having the �Bat Cave� around me was not what I needed.  
  
I bought the CLK 320 because that was all I needed.  I didn�t think that there would be a significant difference between the 6 cylinder 320 and the 8 cylinder 430.  I did not feel that the extra two cylinders with 60 ponies were needed to make my car go from 10 MPH to 15 MPH.  

The RIDE!  The ride is firm without being mushy.  I can feel some of the bigger bumps in the road.  The steering was a bit heavy; this seems to be the biggest complaint of this model.  Since my drive is very straight and not on a formula I track, this was more than fine with me.

My wife and I prefer to take the sedan on long drives.  The CLK is not very comfortable on long trips; it�s my boot around the city car.

The trunk space is roomy and can fit my golf bag easily!  This is not too important since I had to start working, I get to play about once a year now.  Maybe this is a good reason to get my 'double par' score down a bit! ;)

I love this car.  Mercedes has done a wonderful job with its design, performance and creature comforts.  

The only complaint is that it is expensive for what you get and I did have to bring it in to get the initial �bugs� out (speakers were fading in and out).

I would recommend this little car for those who want a nice city car to drive around in.  Take care!
