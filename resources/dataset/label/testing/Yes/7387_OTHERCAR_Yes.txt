            The WRX is a breath taking experiance. That little car can provide you with more fun than you can even begin to comprehend. I am sure you all remember that old commercial for Sprite where you see two guys watching a commercial for the soda called "Juki" and the slogan for it was "it's a party in a can"? Sound familiar... this car is that party in a can, although it costs a little more than a sprite. 
           The agility of this car will make you smile like a hyper 4 year old on lauhging gas at the dentist. You can take turns that you wouldn't even imagine possible, in addition to that you feel safer in the car because of it. A little kid could run in front of you and try to get hit by you, and you could easily dodge him, depending on your reflexes. The All wheel drive actually works wonderfully in the snow, although its not an off-road system, it has certainly saved my skin on more than one occasion. It's wonderful.
         The Braking power is also nothing short of astonishing. Although it is expected from a sports car of its size. You can't fully appreciate the ABS until you are perilously headed towards a stopped car on the highway while its snowing, and you stop with 15 feet to spare. In any different car.... for instance my mom's mini-van, you would have undoubtedly hit the car, not only that, but you would have hit the car in front of you hard. Again, another reason why you feel not only confident, but very safe wherever you are in the car, wether you be in the back or driving.
         The stereo is wonderful, rich full bass, and great high and mid-tones too, although there aren't any speakers in the back, near the trunk, only in the doors, making it  a little dead sounding if you are laying your head back. That is not the only idiosyncracy I have found though. Unlike most cars that have a "Next Track/Skip" button, this has a dial, matching that is perpendicular to the volume knob. You have to twist it about 50 degree's one way to get it to go to the next track, and hold it to skip through the song. Although, it is very intuitive, there is no more 'missing' the buttons or anything.
        3,000 RPM, What can I say. That is where the fun starts. If you are flooring it, and trying to get to highway speed, you can feel the turbo turn at around 2800 RPM, but if you are in 4 on the highway going around 65 (you will be at about 3550) and you floor it, I hope your passengers have shut windows with no hats on, because well, they may never see them again. 
      I would definatly recomend this car as a mid-life crisis, its been very fun for me, and my family, and I would definatly NOT recomend this to someone who has never driven standard before, its very VERY hard to learn on.
