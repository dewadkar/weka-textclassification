            My Nissan Pick-up is a 1994 King Cab 4X4 V-6.  I picked it up in '95 and have never looked back.  It now has over 80,000 miles on it, and has been maintenance free.  I take of it, changing the oil regularly, air filters, gas filters, etc; in return it has taken care of me.  It rides very nice, better than most mid size trucks.  This truck has bucket seats, by far the most comfortable seats I have ever experienced in a truck.  They are as/more comfortable than a car, plus you get the extra leg room from the truck's extended cab.  The price is moderate in comparison to other mid sized trucks; it is a good deal.  I often try and find other '94 Nissan Trucks for sell to get a feel for it's local market value, but I can't ever find one.  The owners just hang on to them, like myself.<br><br>
