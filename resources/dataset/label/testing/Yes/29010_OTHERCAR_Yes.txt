            My boyfriend and I picked this car after determining that we needed only one car between us, but one that could do everything.  In particular, I like to be able to put my bike in the car without using a rack.  We surveyed the lower end SUVs like the Jeep Cherokee, Explorer Sport, and the RAV-4, and found that the CR-V was the perfect compromise.  

The body is small, easy to maneuver, and doesn't make me feel guilty about blocking the visibility of drivers in sedans behind me.  The interior is surprisingly spacious.  Lots of head room, and lots of fun little storage compartments.  Friends who have ridden in the back have all complimented the seats (back seats recline), the plethora of cup holders, and the space.

The dash is like every other Honda and Acura you've been in.  What's not to like?  It's cute, functional, and a great size for both lugging stuff around and squeezing into tight spots in The City.

Demand for this car is very high, so the price at the Honda dealer is not easy to negotiate.  I found a great price at CarsDirect.com, printed it out, brought it to the dealer and said, &quot;If you can beat this, I'll buy it from you.&quot;  I recommend that strategy.  They don't want to lose business to online car sellers, so they'll likely meet your request.

There are two design flaws that stand out in this car: the lack of arm rest for the front seat-passenger (even the two back seat-riders have them!) and the way that the back door opens.  Popping the trunk with either the keyless entry function or the button inside the car opens only the top half of the back door.  This window opens upward, and then the user must open the bottom half of the door by using the door handle.  The confusing part is that the bottom half swings outward, forcing you stand in a certain position to put your things inside.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but right now, I have to think carefully about the order in which I must close the back door.  Bottom part ALWAYS first, or the top glass could break.  I'm thinking of putting a big 1 and 2 sticker on each part to remind me of the steps!

This is not a luxury car, but I am not a demanding driver.  Nor I am experienced in evaluating new cars.  It is an excellent car for the price, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a bigger car but isn't ready for a full size SUV.
