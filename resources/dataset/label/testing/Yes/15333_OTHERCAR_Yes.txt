            Have only recently discovered epinions and I truly love this site. Being a newcomer though, it is hard to follow so many others who have rated items I want to write about. I couldn't read all 116 epinions about the Sony Mavica camera but the one I read by "shumma", a librarian from Georgia, pretty well covered all the points I wanted to make. I also use my digital camera in a school as I am the webmaster of St. Philomena's web page. I really enjoy displaying student art but so many times the art work is done on paper much larger than my scanner can handle. Bulletin boards in our school can be a real thing of beauty and I use my Sony to post pictures much too large for the scanner. It is wonderful to use for taking photos of drama presentations or other student activities as well. 
The major weaknesses I find are the same that shumma found. You do have to carry a large number of disks with you but fortunately they are very easy to change. The other major fault, and it is a bad one, it is very difficult to use the camera outside in bright sunlight. As shumma said, you often have to just guess at what you're looking at. You are able though to set the camera to look at the last shot if you can find a shady spot to do so. 
All in all, I really like this camera which is my own personal property. The school's librarian was able to get a free digital camera but no one uses it because it has to be connected to the PC to download the pictures and it is too much trouble to go through. Also the battery constantly needs to be recharged.
