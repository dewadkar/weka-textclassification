                  This car is awesome, its seats 5 people comfortably, rides smoothly and has great control. The 4wd is great during the winters up in Connecticut. It handles like a charm. I love driving this thing through the snow and watching those poor saps stuck in sedans unable to get out of their driveway. 
      This car was very different for our family to buy as we had always been a minivan/sedan family. We bought this as an experiment and have not regretted it since. I look forward to driving this car in the mornings, and hate when I don't get to.
      The cargo space in this car is great. When I took my sister to college there was so much room for her loads of luggage. We had no problem getting it all in, and we still sat 4 in the car.
      The only thing I find troublesome with the Pathfinder is its sound system. The speakers are weak and poorly positioned. The sound quality is horrible, and there is not one seat where you can get a balanced noise distribution. <br><br>
