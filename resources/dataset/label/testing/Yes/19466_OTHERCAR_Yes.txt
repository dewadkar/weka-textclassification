            What could be better than this?  A digital camera that uses the same floppy disks that your computer uses!  No hardware to buy!  Just point, shoot, and take the disk out and put it in your computer!  I purchased my Mavica used for $360.00, and have been using it weekly for photographing items to put on auction.  Before this, I would have to take pictures with a film camera, drive 30 miles to a 1 hour photo place, spend $8.00 to have them developed, drive 30 miles back, scan them into my computer, and then upload them online.  With the Mavica, all you do is snap the picture, remove the disk, and click on the image (which is already in .JPG mode!)  In my opinion, it is worth the money just for the ease of use.  If you don't like the way a picture turned out, all you have to do is erase it......right on the camera!  The only thing I do not care for with this camera is the LCD display in the back, which smudges easily.  However, you can purchase secondary market covers for these.  The INCLUDED battery charges up in about 1 hour, and lasts for about 70 minutes.  You can fit about 30 pictures on one disk (using the HIGH QUALITY mode), and when it is full, just copy them onto your computer!  Menus are easy to use, and very self explanitory (I have yet to look at the manual).  The zoom is wonderful, it lets you zoom in 10X, which is very close, however, if it isn't close enough, you can buy a bigger zoom for it, which will let you zoom in 100X!  The camera is lightweight, with nice grips, and can be mounted onto a tripod with ease.  One of the nicest things on this camera is the &quot;Features&quot; mode, which lets you photograph in Black &amp; White, Pastel, Negative, or in an antique brown!  Wonderful for those special shots!<br><br>
