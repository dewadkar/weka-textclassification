            Before I rush headlong into a few of my &quot;caveats&quot; of buying this particular digital camera, let me first give a few pros to this camera.

Pro #1
Ease of Use:  Sony has been making consumer-friendly products for years, and the Mavica line follows justly in that tradition.  Within minutes, and without having to read the owner's manual, one can easily figure out how to exploit all of the many features of this camera.

Pro #2
Built in Floppy Drive:  This could probably be a subheading under ease of use, but the floppy drive is what makes it probably the most simple and easy to use file transfer system.  You don't have to buy a new kind of storage media and most people already have and know what to do with floppies.

Pro #3
Durable:  I've dropped this thing twice already and it &quot;takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'&quot;

Pro #4
Battery Life:  It comes with a pretty good battery with Sony's InfoLithium technology.  This lets you recharge your battery at any point without having that nasty memory effect which eventually kills most lithium batteries.  The batteries are also interchangeable with the InfoLithium batteries used in Sony's newer camcorders.

Caveat #1
Price:  Be prepared to spend a little bit more money for this one.  The Mavica line starts at around $600, where a comparable camera (without the floppy drive) starts around $200.

Caveat #2
Lighting Situations:  In low lighting situations, the Mavica FD-81 simply stinks.  I have no clue why Sony decided to put a flash on this camera and then make it so unuseful.  I have been experimenting around in low light level situations and have found that in some cases, pictures taken with a flash come out darker than if they were taken without the flash.  Conversely, in high-lighting situations, mainly outside, the Mavica's LCD screen isn't bright enough to produce an image of what you're going to be shooting.  I have found myself in a few situations where I've had to guess-and-shoot, so to say.  

Caveat #3
Image Quality:  The FD-81 is not a megapixel camera.  The current competing cameras in a similar price-range offer between 1 and 2 megapixel quality giving you a much better image.  

The Verdict:
If you don't consider yourself proficient with connecting cables and doing some extra-techy stuff to get your pictures onto your hard drive this is your best bet.  It's also your best bet if you have an antiquated system that might get bogged down in image transfers.  If, however, you need high-quality images and your computer is able to USB devices, I would invest elsewhere.<br><br>
