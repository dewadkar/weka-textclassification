            We were trying to find a vehicle that got better gas mileage than our 1988 15-passenger Ford Club Wagon.  The first place we decided to try was an auction in Des Moines.  All the vehicles we thought we might be interested went higher than we thought they should for the condition and mileage.  

Disappointed, we started home and decided to look around in some of the used car lots.  We went to a Ford dealership and drove a couple of their mini vans in their 'budget alley'.  One we especially liked was a Ford Windstar, seven passenger.  It just seemed to glide down the road and all the seats were very comfortable.  In fact, everything about the van seemed made for comfort. 

We purchased this vehicle and have been extremely happy with everything about it.  It gets MUCH better gas mileage than our old van!  We keep pinching ourselves to see if this is a dream or not.  It was used when we purchased it and had 104,000 miles on it, but ran like a brand new car.  I highly recommend the Ford Windstar!<br><br>
