            The '86 Suzuki Samurai just screams drive me if you're a sporty, outgoing person with a love for toughness. This car will take you places if you have the patience. It's an oldie, but goodie. At first glance this car looks like a miniature Jeep, but it's not. It's a tough little car that might just leave the Jeep in the dust with it's good gas millage and other little essentials. This car is a purist. There's no air conditioning, (Why would you want that when you got the wind blowing in your face with the top down?)the shocks are tight, (It feels like you're going off-road when the road's straight.) and you're going have to deal with a tight clutch. But that's no biggie. This is what you should expect.

I fell in love the the Samurais when I was a kid. Yeah, about eight or so years old. When I got my license, I wanted to get a Jeep---no, wait! A Samurai! What was I thinking? The Suzuki Samurai is a childhood thing to me, so it's means a lot. My father had an '88 model, but there isn't much of a difference, only the '88 had seat belts in the back. 

My Samurai, when bought needed repairs---but what do you expect from an older car? The old owner's son treated like a toy, so now I take care of it, I dressed it up nice and neat as best I could, put a CD player in it, and even dubbed a Japanese name for it (Mori, meaning Forest). For a car like this, you have to be nice to it, or it'll get mad. Really. Well, maybe not really. My car has it's little quirks, but for classic, you need to watch your car. 

Older cars like this do have their quirks. Repairs may be needed. Overall, a Samurai is something to think about. It's not your average town car.
