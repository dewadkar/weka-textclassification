            My fiancee and I have owned a Civic prior to the Accord. It performed like the Energizer bunny. Unfortunately bunnies get totalled sometimes, which is what happened to Janet's Civic. Coincidentally, the Honda Accord Coupe came out about a month earlier, so we checked it out.

Obviously the Accord Coupe's design looks sharp. The ride is comfortable but a bit noisy. Gas mileage is decent (24-28 mpg). It has nice acceleration and handles very smoothly at 80+ mph (one thing about California that I do love - fast drivers).

It is very roomy for a coupe: a generous back seat and lots of trunk space.

So far (15K miles), we've had no problems whatsoever. We could have had a better buying experience, but that is the fault of the Chicago dealership (beware of the sharks at Loeber!). One regret is not getting the V-6 engine. Now when I accelerate, I need to hit my &quot;turbo button&quot; (turn the AC button off).<br>
