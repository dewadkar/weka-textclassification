            I bought a 1997 Dodge Intrepid a few years ago. I can only say good things about this car. It handles very well on the road, comfortable for long trips, pretty good gas mileage, roomy, has quite a bit of power and overall appearance is very nice.

We never had our Dodge in the shop but for regular maintenance. The only thing that I know for a fact is that the Intrepid does not handle well in the snow. I just moved to Kansas in October of 1999 and found this out right away.

So my husband and I ended up trading our Intrepid in on 4x4 SUV. We only wish we could have afforded to keep both but that was not possible. I do indeed miss my Intrepid and my husband and I have thought about buying another one in the near future for a second vehicle.

So if you are in the market for a great car try the Intrepid, I am sure you will like it as much as I did.<br><br>
