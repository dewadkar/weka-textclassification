            I bought a 96 two door tercel two years ago and have not regretted it once! It is a great car for a graduate student or a recent graduate. The car has needed no major work nor have I had any mechanical problems with it. My car gets great gas mileage, which is wonderful with gas prices so high. 

The car is pretty small and not really comfortable for more than two people. It probably would not be great for a tall, big man but it is a great size for a smaller woman. The car also does not handle well in snow. It slides a lot.<br><br>
