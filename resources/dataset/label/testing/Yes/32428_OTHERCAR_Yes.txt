            Although my Honda Civic is the not the first car I ever had, it is the first car I've bought on my own.  As a starving college student, my budget is limited.  So price is what a major factor when I decided to buy my Civic coupe.  Looks were another factor I valued when I bought this car and in my opinion, the Civic is the best looking economy car out on the market.  Reliability was another issue that I took into account when I was buying a car.  No one can deny that Hondas are one of the most reliable car manufacturers.  Honda cars are consistently given excellent reviews by "Consumer Reports".  When most people think of a 2-door economy car, they probably assume that it doesn't have any room.  Not so with the Honda Civic, developers of the Civic designed it to allow easy entry for both driver and passenger.  Trunk space is another problem when it comes to most economy cars but, for the Honda Civic, I would say it's above average for an economy car.  I remember once I had to drive my girlfriend and her mother to the airport, and they didn't think that their luggage would fit into my car.  To their amazement, everything did, four suitcases and a couple of carry-ons.  Ergonomics in the interior, like with all Hondas, is excellent.  Climate controls and radio controls are all within easy reach for the driver.  Overall vision within the car is excellent, there are no tough blind spots.  One can say that Honda interiors are practical but may be bit "boring".  I've happened to spice my Civic interior with many different aftermarket products.  There are virtual an infinite amount of aftermarket hook-ups available for the Civic,  from white-face gauges, metal pedals, shift knobs, to exhaust and spring upgrades.  The Civic is like a blank canvas that you create your own masterpiece on.  Just like a masterpiece, the Civic will last through out the ages.
