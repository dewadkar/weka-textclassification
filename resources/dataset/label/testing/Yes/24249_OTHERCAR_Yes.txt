            I was very impressed when I dove into this vehicle, escaping a thunderstorm at Alamo car rental at Houston�s hobby airport.  The rental clerk had said I was getting a Chevy Blazer, but this Oldsmobile Bravada was far nicer than the 2001 Blazer I had rented from Alamo while in New Mexico.

This Bravada was equipped with very comfortable leather power seats (two person memory), CD/cassette player, automatic day/night mirror, outside temp/trip computer, ABS brakes, and most importantly (yes Even for Houston in the middle of summer!) SmartTrac 4wheel drive. Later, as I researched this vehicle I fond that all of these items are standard equipment for all Bravadas. Would you believe My passenger was comparing the interior of this vehicle to his three year old BMW 5series!

As I drove the vehicle I noticed the abundance of cup-holders four in the front seat (one in each door map pocket and two in the center console) and two in the back (each door armrest).  Storage included large door map pockets, open bin at front of center console and a covered bin for CD/tapes forming the center armrest.  One nice feature was the dual power outlets at the base of the dash.  Including the cigarette lighter you can plug up to three electronic items at the same time without using a splitter.  The cargo area is not as big as other SUV's but useful as it is and you aren't driving around a rig big enough for it own zip code.

The Bravada was extremely easy to drive.  The driving posistion was nearly ideal with most controls for the radio and climate control positioned within easy reach and angled towards the driver. Visibility was good for all angles.  The rear headrests did not intrude too much and the window tint did not hamper night vision.   Compared to the Blazer I had in New Mexico this was far more powerful, of course this rental had 16,000 on the clock as opposed tot he Blazer�s 1,000.  According to the on board trip computer, I was averaging 17.4 MPG. Not too bad for a 4X4 SUV.  Don�t tell Alamo but cruising at 80-85 MPH was not a problem and had low levels of wind/drivetrain noise.   

The suspension set up is probably the most easy to live with of all the GM trio (Chevy Blazer, GMC Jimmy and Olds. Bravada) The ride was nearly car smooth without much lean in turns.  Any truck-like bounce was nearly absence but at times you could feel the rear suspension working to keep things cushy back there.   Brake dive was kept in check with easy pedal modulation and good stopping power.  Interesting the Bravada is equipped with 4wheel disc brakes as opposed to the usual rear-drum set up.

With the automatic 4X4 system I never had to wonder if I was in the correct mode of the type of road I was on.  As I drove away from the rental location the torrential rainstorm made all the roads slick. Even as I gunned the engine while turning the rear end refused to break lose and fish tail. The Bravada just cruised around the corner like it was on rails. Later I had an opportunity to drive the Bravada on some off-road trails through the beach sand dunes (Again please don�t tell Alamo!!!!).   Deep sand or small water crossings were not a problem.  Even as I pointed the vehicle up a nearly impossible trail it handled it with ease.  We never noticed the 4X4 system shifting. Just simply carrying us where we pointed it.  Gratefully the suspension also absorbed all the rough going without bottoming out.  On dry pavement you could feel the 4X4 system binding a bit on sharp turns but not too much to be bothersome.  The Blazer and Jimmy models have 4X4 systems that you can either lock in 2wd mode and low ranges, these might be helpful in serious off-road challenges but as I said we had no problems during our excursion even with the street based Uniroyal Laredo tires.
