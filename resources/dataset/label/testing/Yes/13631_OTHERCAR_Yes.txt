            I owned BMW motorcycles and cherished the power, design and handling. It was a goal to buy a BMW car after an overall positive experience with my 1992 R100GS motorcycle. So I set out to my local Dealer.I was reedy to dive into the the Ultimate Driving Machine. 

I decided early on I would buy a pre-owned model to save myself from the HUGE depreciation that was revealed with little research. Besides, after test driving a handful, these cars really don't feel worn out even after 80k miles on the clock. 

I ended up buying a 1992 325i. Although I wanted a 5 speed, I'd need an auto trans so my wife could drive the car, if needed. My 325i was a 1 owner car with average wear and tear. Here are some items that needed attention. 

1. Water in the rear left tail lens due to a poor seal. 

2. Original Suspension was mushy due to wear. The seats were less than comfortable and I found my legs going numb on long rides no matter what position I had the 6-way power adjustable seat. Never solved this and was one of the key reasons for selling it. 

3. Insurance had increased nearly 40% total premium from my 1999 Honda Accord I replaced with it. 

4. The fog lights leaked and fogged (However, the dealer changed these for me at no cost to me). 

5. I found other drivers going out of their way to be rude to me (cutting me off, etch). During the 7 months I owned the 325i, I had more teenagers pull up in their souped up Civics looking to race than I could count. (Oh yeah, I beat em' all).. 

Space is limited in the trunk and long legged people will not enjoy the back seat whatsoever. 

Conclusion: This was a fun car that I had no regrets having other than it was not a well thought out purchase for my personal situation at the time. Being a 32 year-old father of a 3 and 1 year-old calls for more a SUV or Minivan to handle the task. This is definitely an enthusiasts car, make no mistake about that!!
