            Photography has been a hobby of mine for many years. A few years ago I bought a full Canon Elan outfit that I love to use. However, since I got my Coolpix 950 last year I have only used my Canon film camera twice. I have taken over 3000 picture with my 950 and when the Coolpix 990 comes out I will probably buy that too. The 950 has been a joy to use. It has full auto plus semi-manual controls. I say semi because you cannot change the aperture and shutter speed at the same time. This would seem like a limitation to an experienced user but I haven't fount this to be a problem at all. I love the swivel and also the compact size. I'm sure if you are reading this you already have done research on the specs so I won't bore you with those details. I will tell you what deficiencies I have found.  It eats batteries, especially with the LCD on.  YOU MUST USE NIMH BATTERIES!!! This is the only solution and should be told to all new users because most people will think there is something wrong with the camera when it burns through the 4 alkalines in the box in 10 minutes. Also, the compact flash card door tends to pop open at times.  I have heard that Nikon redesigned this and took care of the problem.  The 950 only comes with an 8MB CF card for storage.  This is WAY too small and another one of your first purchases will be at least a 48MB card.  It is too bad that it cannot use an IBM Microdrive.  All in all, I love this camera! I have taken pictures that I never would have bothered with and that would have been too expensive using film plus a scanner. If you are new to digital cameras and are looking for a first one I would say go for it! Once you start using a digital camera you won't believe how you ever lived without it.<br><br>
