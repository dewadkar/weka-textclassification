            The 1999 Ford Ranger Ext Cab is a pleasure in all aspects of this fine machine.  The ride is comparable to any SUV on the road today.  The 3.0 V-6 option engine has enough power for any towing capacity imaginable in a mid-sized truck.  You should never have any problems with this engine as long as you keep your oil changed every 2500 miles.  A smooth ride awaits you and bumpiness is kept to a minimum as your going down the highway.  Dual air-bags plus a improved height ratio has improved the safety of the 1999 Ranger.  The passenger side airbag is equipped with a key turn off switch for children under the age of 5.  Noticeable anti-lock brakes prevent the fishtale effect commonly found on trucks in rainy weather.  The only downside to this vehicle is some road noise and gas mileage could be improved.  However, overall for the vehicles in it's class there is none better for overall reliability and comfort.  Take your own test drive, I've owned three in last 10 years and never had a problem with any and am always complimented on the looks, especially the new flared box model.  Good Driving!<br><br>
