<TEXT>
            We purchased the Tahoe in 1998....We love it..we have driven coast to coast with it and it handles beautifully. I have 4 girls but at the time of purchase i had only 3. Right now we are CRAMPED for space. I also fear at time the idea of &quot;tipping&quot; over...although i understand it is unlikely it still remains on my mind. I also would like a CD player tha hold more than one CD at a time. Other than that..WE LOVE IT!!! I understand that the newer model for 2000 does have another back seat. I just might trade in mine and upgrade to the newer model now that we have another child and a dog.<br><br>
