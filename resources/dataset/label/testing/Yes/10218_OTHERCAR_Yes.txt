            I have to admit I was one of the first out of the gate to purchase the new Lexus RX300.  It's silky smooth engine and fine fit and finish are up to traditional Lexus standards.  

Although Lexus may tell you otherwise, this car shares many components with the Toyota Camary platform (along with the Toyota Avalon, Toyota Sienna, and Lexus ES300) and this is not a bad thing.  This in and of itself makes for an incredibly stable, dependable vehicle.  

The ride is traditional Lexus.  You will not find another SUV that rides this much like a car.  Feature for feature this SUV simply cannot be outclassed. What is standard Lexus fair are &quot;options&quot; on many other vehicles.

In the course of my purchase I tested the Mercedes Benz ML320, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Infiniti QX4.  The Mercedes is a close second, however, price point is higher, and fit and finish are inferior.  The Jeep is an excellent competitor, however, it has been consistently plagued with problems.  The Infiniti truly does not belong in this class.  It shows it routes, i.e. a fully loaded Pathfinder.  The ride and quality here are traditional SUV fair and therefore it truly cannot compete.  

If I had to choose something to hate it would have to be my love/hate relationship with the exterior's smooth rounded lines.  The SUV itself is often mistaken for a &quot;minivan&quot; (heaven forbid).

It is often noted that this SUV has no true &quot;low gear&quot; for four-wheel drive.  First, I would ask if you truly &quot;need&quot; this.  Second, The Lexus truly demonstrates prowess in off road situations despite the lack of a low 4.  I've tested it myself and have been unable to get my Lexus stuck in any situation.  

The price point is extremely competitive, however, you are looking at a $40,000 MSRP fully loaded. 

Truly this vehicle is a Sevan i.e. part SUV, part Luxury Sedan.  You will not find another manufacturer that marries the two so well.
