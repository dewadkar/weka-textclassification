            First, I should explain my title.  For those who may not know, Volkswagen, Porsche and Audi are all related companies who share their technologies with each other.  So the VW Passat shares the same engine, platform, drivetrain, suspension and other features as the Audi A4.  

I should also say that I leased a 1998 Audi A4 with the same engine, platform and transmission before I leased the Passat so I'll make some comparisons between the two in my review.  

When I owned my Audi A4, I really liked the car.  I had wished it had a bigger back seat and got frustrated with the (mostly minor) electrical problems the car would occasionally have.  My plan at the end of my lease was to get another A4.  But the NASDAQ started crashing and I decided I couldn't justify (or afford) and Audi at that point.  So I decided to "step down" to the Volkswagen line instead.

It turns out, the VW is a <b>MUCH BETTER</b> car than my A4 ever was!  It handles better, rides smoother and quieter, is more luxurious inside, has more legroom in the back seat and has interior and exterior styling that is hard to beat!  

<b>ENGINE</b>
The Passat has the same 190hp 2.8L V6 engine as the A4.  This engine offers 30 valves (5 per cylinder) which is unheard of in non-racing automobiles.  The addition of the extra cylinder allows the engine to "breathe" better resulting in less emissions and a bit more power.  It does an excellent job of pulling the car through turns and easily drives the optional 4-wheel drive system (4Motion), which I'll talk about later.  Note however that the engine requires high-octane gas.  This is required, not suggested as some other cars.

<b>TRANSMISSION</b>
I decided to go with the "Tiptronic" transmission which again is the exact same as the transmission I had in my Audi.  This transmission, which was invented by Porsche, allows the user to switch to a "manual" mode by moving the stick to the right.  By pushing up and down on the stick, you can up-shift or down-shift the transmission as needed.  It's so easy - there isn't even a clutch to push.  And the car won't let you make a mistake.  If you wait too long to shift, and the tachometer goes to the red, it will shift for you to prevent blowing up the engine.  As neat as this feature is, you probably won't use it too often.  There's nothing fun about shifting in traffic and unless you get the chance to drive on the open road, you'll probably forget you have the feature.  But if you choose an automatic, this is the one you'll get.

<b>DRIVETRAIN</b>
There's a very popular option on Audi's called Quattro.  It's also available on VW's under the name "4Motion".  Unfortunately, 4Motion isn't as popular because people don't seem to know what it is.  (And let's face it, the name isn't as cool as Quattro!)  4Motion helps the car handle any condition where it may lose traction with the road better than any other drive system.  Here's how it works... If a wheel loses traction with the road because of hard cornering or wet or icy roads, the car can sense the slippage and apply that wheel's power to the remaining 1, 2 or 3 wheels that still have a good grip.  So as long as one of your wheels is still making good contact, your car will continue to move in the direction it should go.  This system is so amazing, you can drive in the snow without chains.  As a matter of fact, the owner's manual warns you to never put chains on this vehicle.  I can say for certain it improves the car's cornering significantly.  And while I haven't driven my 4Motion car in the snow, I did once drive my Audi with Quattro in a terrible blizzard in Lake Tahoe and had <b>NO</b> problems with slipping and sliding.  You'll also notice how well it works on wet roads.  Have you ever been at a red light in the rain?  When the light turned green, and you gave your car some gas, did the front wheels slip as they tried to make traction on the slippery painted white line of the crosswalk?  This doesn't happen with 4Motion.  If the front wheels even slightly start to slip, the car will send the power to the back wheels.  It happens so quickly, you won't even notice that it's happening.  It's silent and automatic.  <b>NOTE:</b>  I don't understand this but if you get 4Motion on your car, the back seat does not fold down.  My dealer didn't have a good explanation for this either.  So, if you want a folding back seat, you'll have to give up this excellent drive system.  Sometimes I miss the folding seat but I'd choose 4Motion any day!

<b>FEATURES</b>
I'll try to discuss as many of the car's interior and exterior features as I can think of in this section.  First, let's talk airbags.  You have more airbags in this car than you do cup holders.  There's a driver and passenger airbag of course.  Then you have airbags in both of the front seats, which protect the driver from a side impact.  In addition, you also have an airbag that runs from the A pillar (the one that holds the windshield in place) to the C pillar (the one that holds the back window in place).  This airbag protects the occupants from hitting their heads on the windows and also protects them from breaking glass crashing in on them from the side windows.  Hopefully you'll never need them.  That's 6 airbags and 4 cup holders.  By the way, the front seat cup holders are the first excellent ones I've ever seen in a German car.  They're deep, wide and have 3 spring-loaded clips to hold your drink in place.  The ones in the back seat are located in the center armrest, which must be pulled down to access them.  These are your typical German cup holders - pretty much worthless.  Standard features on the GLX include a full power moonroof, integrated fog lights which can be turned on by pulling out the headlight switch, daytime running lights which come on when you release the parking brake, height adjustable front seat belts, attach points for kids car seats in the back, anti-lock brakes, alarm (very weak horn on the alarm!), <b>GENUINE</b> wood trim (most cars have plastic wood or "plood"), a manual rear window sunshade which can be kept up while driving since it's perforated with thousands of holes to allow visibility, a multi-function trip computer (time driven, miles to empty, average speed, average miles per gallon), a rain sensor built into the back of the rear view mirror which passes the windshield wipers whenever a user-defined amount of rain is on the windshield, an automatically dimming rear view mirror (dims and clears fairly quickly), cruise control, automatic climate control system, pollen/pollution filter, power windows, power outside mirrors (the right one can be set to point down whenever the car is in reverse so you can make sure nobody or nothing is under your right rear wheel before you back up), fully adjustable steering wheel, heated front seats, heated windshield wiper nozzles so they won't freeze in the cold, a "Monsoon" stereo (should be a Nonsoon - weak amp and crummy speakers),  8 way power driver and passenger seats, 3 person seat memory on the driver's seat, power mirrors that can fold in to drive your car through a narrow place, and built in Homelink system for controlling your garage door or security gate.

<b>QUALITY</b>
I have had no major problems with my car.  There was an initial rattle coming from the airbag area of the passenger's side.  My first dealer wouldn't take care of it and simply said "it's a moving vehicle - of course it's going to rattle".  But the 2nd dealership solved the problem in 1 visit.  The doors are solid when you close them and everything feels like it was carved out of granite.  Knobs are easy to reach and figure out how to use and the dashboard lights give off a blue light that looks sharp and is easy on the eyes.  My only complaint, and this is minor but annoying, is that the 4 switches on the driver's door for the 4 windows is in a strange location.  I've driven the car almost 2 years now but I still manage to push the left rear window button when I meant to push the driver's window button.  It may be awkward but is one of the few things I can find to complain about.  

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
I've had many friends say how surprised they are that this car is as nice as it is.  If you think of VW's as being econo-boxes, you have to see this car.  It will change your opinion forever.  I read a story soon after buying the car that the CEO of VW said he thought VW could be a world-class car that could easily compete with Mercedes and BMW.  It was his goal to prove that.  There's no doubt in my mind that they're on the right track.  But, since VW doesn't carry the clout that the "luxury" brands do, it's priced like you'd expect a VW to be priced.
