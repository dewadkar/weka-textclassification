            Buying a car today isn't an easy choice.  But, with a little help you can make the right choice and get a Mazda 626.  I needed something sporty but for a family that could get as much mileage with a fill up as possible.  Guess what?  I found it. 
 I love this car.  I haven't purchased a car that I really loved since my mustang was destroyed in a wreck in 1993.  I can't find a thing wrong with this car.  I get about anywhere from 460 to 520 miles to the fill up.  There is plenty of room for the two children, husband and the dog.  I love the sporty look and have ordered a spoiler for the back to give it that special touch.  I love to drive this car.  I sometimes feel like I am a race car driver taking those corners. 
 I feel that I can rate a car better than most. I have owned a station wagon ,mustang,cougar,tempo,fairlane,chevette,ranger,corvette,mini van,le sabre, and two explorers(one used and one new).  
I know that when I purchase again it will be Mazda and I am confident that if you give this car a chance you will be thankful you did.  I think this car is for everyone.  Family no family, old , young, whatever you are this car is the one for you.<br><br>
