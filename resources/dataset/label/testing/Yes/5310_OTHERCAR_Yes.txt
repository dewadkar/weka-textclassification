            I have the 98 Accord V6 and love the car despite a few small flaws. Biggest mistake I made was choice of color. Black in South Florida is a BAD idea.

Problems I had:
* Windshield rubber seal - coming off ever since I got the car.
* Driver side window - making wind noise since I got car. Had rubber seal  replaced once, which helped but it's still there.
* after 43k miles, transmission is making a clunking noise when shifting into overdrive at low speeds.

What I love:
* Looks. It is a very nice looking car.
* Handling
* Performance
* Ergonomics
* Fuel efficient
* Fun to drive

Honda has done a great job fine tuning this vehicle. Quality in details was better on my 2 previous Honda's (Prelude and Civic). Overall, Honda has to be my favorite manufacturer (besides Porsche) and I will certainly buy one of their models again in the future (most likely Acura 3.2TL)<br><br>
