            Overall Opinion: I love the easy usability of the Olympus D-450 Zoom. It small enough to carry with you anywhere, yet holds enough pictures that you don't have to &quot;download&quot; every time you shoot. The quality for the most part is very good. I've seen better, but then I've seen a lot worse.

Price: $699 at the time of purchase, $599 recently. For the fact that you are getting a zoom camera with flash that holds 132 quality pictures, this is a fair price and I would spend it again.

Zoom: Unlike normal 35mm zoom cameras, you can't get nearly as close, but at least you have the ability. Downside to the zoom, I've noticed that if you zoom all the way out, you will get a slightly blurry picture. Recommendation, if you want to use the zoom, extend it all the way out and then a slight click back in. There you have a perfectly focused picture.

Picture Display: I love using this feature. Being able to see what the picture will hold without having to squint your eyes is great. Just be careful, the glass smudges easily. This doesn't ruin your pictures, but you should keep some cleaning tissue close at hand.

Quality: Low quality (you can get 132 pictures) - Use for everyday types of pics that you just want to email to your friends.
         Medium quality (takes about 28 pictures) - If you plan on printing your pictures, use this setting. You can literally see the individual hairs on a persons head.
         High quality (takes about 4 pictures) - These are very large files with a lot of detail. I do not use this setting very often. It is hard to stop and download your pictures every few minutes.

I would definitely recommend this camera to my friends. It is a slightly above average camera. It was used for my wedding, as well as my 35 mm, and some of my favorite pics were taken by the digital.<br><br>
