            I haven't regretted my decision to purchase this car for a minute!  I bought it in March of '98 and waited and waited for months til it showed up at the dealership and the wait was definitely worth it.  If you haven't been in one of these at night, you're missing out...the lighting experience might be what makes your mind up to purchase it.

I'm 6'5&quot; and do not fit easily into most cars, but inside the Beetle, I've got a good 5-6&quot; of head room and am incredibly comfortable inside of it.

The internal stylings of the car are great and a lot of attention was paid to the details of the driving experience.  I have the manual version of the car and am not incredibly happy with how it shifts...it's a little too smooth for my tastes but that's my only complaint with it.<br><br>
