            I love this car.  It has a spacey front winshield which makes you feel that the car is twice as big, runs smooth, and is as good looking as any new car.  It gives the sedan a sport look.  It has a good safety and running record.  On Dateline, it scored &quot;good&quot; on the crash tests for the insurance companies.  The interface is like that of many modern cars, with the bubble look, and of course can be ascessorized with a cd player and other options.  It gets over 30 miles a gallon, and is a great addition to a family with 2 or 3 young children.  If your looking for a larger family car for your aging children, i'd look at the Dodge intrepid.  Or, if your looking for the luxury addition of the Breeze, get the Chrysler Cirrus, which is a very nice car in its own write.  It's a great car for the value and is very sleek, check it out now!<br><br>
