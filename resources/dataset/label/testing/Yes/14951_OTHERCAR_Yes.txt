            This is the ideal camera for those of us who sell items online, and need to show our products to the world.  No digital camera could be easier to use - just point and shoot.  The Mavica stores up to 24 JPG images on a single ordinary floppy disk, and the images are all ready to be uploaded to the Web.   No adaptors, no cables, no need for image software (though it can be useful for cropping or rotating images).  Built in 10x zoom and autofocus.  

My one quibble: the built-in flash is very powerful, which is presumably useful for snapshots but can be overwhelming for close-ups of jewelry and other small items.  I've heard suggestions to drape a handkerchief or other piece of cloth over the flash - but that's sort of a nuisance.  I get around it by shooting small objects in bright daylight.

If you get prints of your digiphotos, you'll find image quality does not yet approach that of a standard 35MM camera.  That's not unique to the Mavica.  It'll be a few years before we see really high-resolution digital photos at a consumer-affordable price.  Until then, the Mavica compares favorably with what's on the market.

The price is good, and when you think of the money you'll save on film and developing, it gets even better.  My Mavica has more than paid for itself with the increase in action on my auctions.  If you're selling online, this is definitely the camera for you.
