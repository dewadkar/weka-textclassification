               I love how this vehicle looks both inside and out.  There is no feeling in the world quite like driving a European Auto.  The commitment toward luxury BMW has even in its three series is unsurpassed.  My mother has owned her's for about 3 years and i never miss an oppurtnity to park my vehicle and take hers for a date.
  
   The good things about this car are too many to list.  Some of the major highlights are a smooth ride, a fine factory sound system, and the fact that this car will fly.  Most inportantly however, the BMW produces the most comfortable leather seats i have ever touched in my life.

  The vehicle only has two downfalls.  THe insurance rate on it is outreagous.  Also, it is very difficult to find parts, and when you do they are very expensive.<br><br>
