            Canon has put together a nice little upgraded version of their popular Digital Elph.  Added Movie clips, and 3x optical zoom.

Let's look at the PROS.  #1 advantage is, of course, its size.  With a camera that's so small and easy to carry around, you'll end up using it alot more often.  Trust me on this one, it's no use even if you have the most advanced camera, if leaving in your closet all the time. :) (It's too bad this unit is actually a little bit bigger than a Digital Elph S100)  And of course the well constructed metal body does a good job protecting your investment.

3X optical zoom is pretty standard these days with the newer generation of digital cameras, so that's a nice upgrade over last year's model.

One last thing I like about this camera, is that it uses CF memory.  Why? Because they're rather inexpensive compare to other memory options, for example, a 64MB Memory Stick would cost double the price of a 64MB CF. :)

The battery does a fine job for its size.  I could fill the 64MB CF card without having to re-charge.  I have never need to use it beyond that, so I am not sure how much longer it can last.

On to the bad stuff. Now, why the heck they couldn't make it a 3MegaPixel?  If they did, this unit would be comparable to a SONY DSC-P1.  I mean, all new digital cameras are at least 3MegaPixel these days. With the lower cost of CF, people wouldn't mind getting at least a 128MB RAM, so that's plenty of pics even at 3MegaPixel.

This unit is mildly costly, but that's a premium you're paying for the compact size.

There is zero optional parts for this camera, so treat this as a point and shoot camera.

Oh, the minimum distance for macro is now 16cm compare to last year's 10cm.

One thing I want to say about the flash is that it doesn't charge up fast enough.  I am not sure it is just me, but sometimes when I take a series of shots (at the same object, from the same position) that require the flash, I noticed the amount of light I get is different among the pics.

And are they ever going to fix that tiny little rubber thing that covers the digital out?  I'd bet that's the first thing that'll break with this camera.

Overall, nice little package, two thumbs up.
