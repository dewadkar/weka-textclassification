            My husband and I bought a used 95 4 dr. Blazer in the fall of last year.  It had just under 50K miles on it at the time.  We've managed to drive it hard enough to put 38K miles on it in one year.  We love for driving long trips as we have our own business which requires occasional long distance driving and also have family two to 8 hours out of town.  The Blazer drives very smoothly, much more comfortably than my husbands Cavalier, which is wonderful for allowing our baby to sleep peacefully.  It is one of the lower to the ground SUV's, so it drives like a car w/o feeling like you are going to fall over going around turns.  The height is perfect for placing our son into his car seat w/o bending or strain.  I have the push button 4WD option which come in very handy when it snows, or we have to drive in the mountains. It has plenty of space making it very comfortable for several people to fit w/o being squashed, even w/ a child safety seat.   
  My only complaint is that it does not handle perfectly on wet roads.  Last fall I was driving on semi-wet pavement using precautionary speed when the truck hit a dry patch and spun out.  Later I come to find out that this happened due to a part in the anti-lock brakes that is currently being recalled.  The company has been very good about taking responsibility for any recalls for the truck.  They gladly fix them w/o charging.  This is the second recall I have dealt w/ in the year that I've owned it.  The other was just for a wiper part.
