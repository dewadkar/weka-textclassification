            I chose the Kodak DC-210 over a couple of others for several reasons.

1. It uses inexpensive batteries. (4 AAs)
2. It uses a flashcard which can be read by a usb reader.
3. It looks like a normal camera from the front.
4. The price was better than many other cameras.

I have done photography professionally in the past and so when I began looking for a digital camera I wanted something that was in my price range and yet would give me reasonably high quality photos.

Once I actually got the camera in my hands I was impressed.  The actual size of the pictures at the highest resolution is huge!  In addition, by using the basic software, I discovered that I could get pretty incredible enlargements.   In fact I have found that for web applications I have to reduce the lowest resolution size even more for it to upload and download quickly.  

My particular camera came with additional software.  Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 and Pagemill 2.0.   These applications are helpful and pretty simple to use.

Overall I have really enjoyed and appreciated the ease and quality of this camera. 

In truth the only real gripes that I have are pretty minor. 
1. You have to save the pictures into a different format to use them in any program other than the Kodak programs.
2. The camera is somewhat heavy for its size making long shoots without a tripod a little difficult.
3. The power button is a little to close to the shutter button.

Last of all you need to decide before you purchase a camera what exactly you need in the camera and what you can live with.  Then look long and hard at all of the ones currently on the market.  Don't just run out to get a camera because someone else has one.  Check out epinions and ask around about each camera you are interested in.  Remember that an expensive camera that doesn't do what you need or want is pretty worthless.

Above all, have fun with your camera. <br><br>
