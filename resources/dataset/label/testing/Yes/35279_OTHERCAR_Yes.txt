            When my old car, a 1989 Lincoln LSC was on the outs, I decided that it was time to purchase a newer, more sensible and family oriented car.  We didn,t have the money for a new car, so we looked for a late model used car.  I wanted a family car - one that was not so sporty, yet was nice looking, roomy - we have a 4 yr old daughter, and low in both cost and insurance.  The Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys are high priced vehicles, and from what I was told, they are among the most stolen cars - so we looked for something along the same lines, but not so flashy.  The Mitsubishi Galant seemed like the perfect choice.

The GAlant is a four-door, passenger vehicle, and came fully equipt with all the options.  It has power everything, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and seats five.  We did not purchase a model with leather interior, but the basic interior we do have is nice as well.  The trunk is extremely roomy, and it is a pleasure to drive.  Being that it is a 4 cylinder, the Galant gets good gas milege, and we have yet to experience any problems with it.

The Galant is very similar to the Nissan Altima, which I had also looked at.  However, as I stated in an earlier opinion, the Altima is a great car-only after the 1996 model.  That model was the very first year the Altima came out, and it was like a &quot;test version&quot;.  I have been advised by a number of salesmen not to look at the '96 model.

We have had our Galant for a mere 5 months so far, but when I'm driving I truly feel like I'm driving a new car. <br><br>
