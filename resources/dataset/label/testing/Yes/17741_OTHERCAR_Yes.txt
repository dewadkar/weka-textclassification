            I mean it.  December 17, 1998, I was involved in a massive collision that ended up involving nine vehicles.  To make a long story short, I was hit from the side, then the rear, then plowed underneath the truck in front of me, then slammed tightly underneath again from behind.  It took police and the fire department over two hours to separate our vehicles, and I was trapped in my car for almost twenty minutes.  Most of the cars in the middle of this pile-up, like my own, were demolished.  The crumple zones on my Saturn made the car look horrific, and it was obvious that I should have been terribly injured.  I only suffered a fabric burn and some bruising from the seat belt.  The airbag and safety system in this car is incredible.  I owe Saturn my life.

Even more incredible.  The engine still ran when they pulled it out of the wreckage.  Talk about impressive!  I recommend this car to anyone concerned about the safety of themselves and their families.<br><br>
