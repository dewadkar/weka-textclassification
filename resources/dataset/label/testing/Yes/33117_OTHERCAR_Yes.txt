                This car is probably the best automobile I have ever owned!  My wife and I are expecting our first child in June, and we needed to get rid of the old &quot;deathtrap&quot;, and focus on something safe and reliable.  Our first thought was Chevrolet.  We researched the competition (Toyota Camry, Pontiac Grand Prix, Honda Accord, Ford Taurus) and found that the 2000 Chevy Malibu LS offered the most bang for our buck.
    One of the most important selling points for us was all of the standard safety features and comforts on the &quot;LS&quot; model.  The fact that most of the features on the Malibu that are standard (4-wheel anti-lock brakes, passenger-side air bag, 4-speed automatic transmission, V6, passive theft deterrent, just to name a few) are optional equipment on the comparable models is what made up our minds.
     Another strong point is the interior cabin room.  I am 6'1&quot; and I was worried about having room to ride in it.  I not only have plenty of driving room, but I can put the front bucket seat all the way back, and still have comfortable room to sit directly behind it in the back.
     I can't believe the ride you get in this car!  The engine is so quiet at idle, it's hard to tell if the car's running or not.  We hear hardly any engine noise at speeds up to 45 m.p.h.  We enjoy taking weekend drives through the country and foothills of Northern California, and I can't get over how the Malibu races right up those hills!!
     If you're in the market for a new car, and you're leaning towards a mid-sized sedan, do yourself a favor and go test drive this car.  It will sell itself within 5 miles.<br><br>
