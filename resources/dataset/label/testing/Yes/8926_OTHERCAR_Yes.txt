            I bought a 98 Dodge Grand Caravan in 99. It was a year old with only 12,000 K's. I love the design of this van, it's very aerodynamic in appearance, almost looking like some kind of futuristic shuttle-craft. The best looking mini-van out there, in my opinion. I was very happy with the van, but dissapointed that the windows weren't tinted. 

It was just a week or so after I bought it that the transmission croaked, taking out the trans-axle with it. Luckily it was still under Chrysler Warranty and it was fixed. Since then my gas mileage has been noticeably worse. 

It handles very well for such a large vehicle. I am easily able to maneuvere (spelling?) around the parking lots of shopping malls, and it has quite a tight turning circle, at least so it appears to me. City driving is quiet, highway driving produces a lot of wind noise. Speaking of highways - the Caravan is a joy to drive on highways. It doesn't veer, or wobble, the cruise-control is easy to use. It is not a sports car, so taking off from 0 to 60 in record time is not recommended, but on the highway it can overtake other vehicles when necessary.

The ride is smooth, but not a feather bed. The AC is refreshing. The radio/tape is fine, but it's that awkward Chrysler oversized type, so that if you want to get a different one installed it can be costly and a pain in the neck.

I've taken the van from Ontario to New York, Cape Cod and Maine, and each time it was reliable and didn't overheat, or degrade in performance even after a straight 12 hours of highway speeds. I don't find the seats uncomfortable, but the rear bench is a little too close to the middle bench, and it's a heavy sucker. Removing it is easy, unsnap the handle thingys, but then you have to lift it out, and when I say heavy, I mean it. It took two grown men to get that baby out.

There's lots of room for luggage, groceries or garage sale junk in the back, behind the rear bench. I think the designers could afford to move it a few inches back, and there would still be acres of room back there.

I like the two sliding doors, very useful. But the rear hatchback door can't be opened from the inside, unlike the older model Caravans.

Overall, I would highly recommend this van, it's a workhorse.<br><br>
