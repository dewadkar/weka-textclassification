            LCD screen is hard to see in the sun.  Red lines appear in the LCD screen when you try to take a picture with a lot of exposure.  The battery life doesn't last over a day's worth of usage.  The video capture is low quality.  It is not truly one touch uploading.  You must first turn camera on and then price the upload button twice.  The LCD screen isn't as easy to see vertically as it is to see when viewing it horizontally.  It gets a little dark when you try to look at it horizontally.  Battery is really tough to take out from the inside.  You have to use your nails just to take it out.  Aside from this, it gets a little annoying to have to twist the camera lens everytime you want to start using the camera; however, this is also a positive because you can create various angles quite easily ... especially when you are taking auto-shots with the timer.  Also, It has a feature that allows you to take 16 shots in consecutive order, however the pictures are squeezed into one big picture to make the little ones a bit tiny and fuzzy.  The four directional joystick is a little hard to use.  It wouldn't be easy for a person to use if he/she has a big thumb.  This is pretty much all my negatives for the camera after using it for a week and taking it to Yosemite for a vacation.  

Despite all the above.  I still the like the camera for its compact size.  I wrote down all the little negatives I saw because I didn't know about them before I bought the camera.  However, regarding the picture quality for a 3.2 megapixel camera, it delivers for me.  I took it to Yosemite National Park and I got a ton of great pictures.  I bought a 128 mb compact flash card for the camera and I can now take about 80 pictures at the camera's finest, highest resolution mode.  I also like the camera's ability to zoom in and out of picture post-view mode using the lcd screen.  You can zoom 6 times to view very close into the picture you just took or you could zoom out to see four pictures at once in the lcd screen for easy navigation.  But overall, my friends admire the compact size.  It's so small it fits into an eyeglass pouch I had lying around the house.  I would compare it to roughly the size of a medium/small remote control.  I dislike the fact that the safety cord is on the left side though.  This is because the capture-button is located on the right; thus, you can't hold the safety cord in your right hand and press the button at the same time for added safety.  

Thus I'd say the best thing about the camera is it's good picture quality and compact size.  The worst things I'd say about it is that it is hard to take the battery out when you have to charge it, the battery has to be charged after a day's use and the lcd screen is hard to look at when the sun is glaring at it.  However overall, I'm happy I bought this camera.  When I saw it's predecessor, the Nikon Coolpix 2500 ranked #1 by a leading consumer testing magazine (i'm sure all of you know the one of the leading testing organizations that publish a magazine of their findings) I decided to buy this one.  I am just an average camera user.  I'm just an average 22 year-old that wants to take pictures from time to time and overall, I am happy with the camera.
