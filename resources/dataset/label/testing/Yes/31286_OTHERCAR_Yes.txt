            I love the Volvo Wagon and this is the car we convinced Mom to buy.  Our family and extended family has bought Volvo models four times.  We have the 850 Sedan and find it to be as good as the V70, thus our recommendation to my mom.  Our motivating force in recommending Volvo is Safety.  This model has dual airbags and side-impact airbags.  Plus we believe in the traction package and have the winter package, as well.  The Volvo is the only car we drive when it snows and my mom has a lot more confidence in this car than her Buick.  

<b>The features we like best are:</b>  The roominess with plenty of storage space when the seats are folded down.  This car can accommodate 5 adults -and a baby can ride in the built-in safety seat.  It is easy to pack the car due to its lower level than a van or suv.  The Volvo wagon has the option of the third row.  If you don't opt for it it leaves you more room underneath.  My mom uses the cargo room for gardening supplies and her cross country bike.  Her biking hobby is the main reason she went with the station wagon.

The car drives smoothly and handles perfectly.  The turning radius is the best I have ever experienced.  I like the improvements (from the 850) on the dashboard.  Everything is in a position that makes sense and the windows are easier to operate  (on the door panel vs. the center console.)  It has a double locking system meaning you can keep the back locked while you only open the front.  

The car is extremely comfortable - especially for tall people.  There is plenty of head and leg room.  We have the leather package which I highly recommend for families of children or pets its easier to keep clean and the seats are even more comfortable - plus you can heat them up. The seats offers good lumbar support, too!

The gas mileage is reasonable, between 19 and 21 mpg.  

The radio offers good sound.  And the climate controls work fast and efficiently.  The defroster works quickly and defogs the windows in record time  

Many people look at BMW and Audi also when shopping for Volvo.  The Volvo costs less than BMW and Audi.  

If you are considering a wagon - Volvo is the way to go in the wagon lineup.  We love this brand and find it to be a low maintenance, fun to drive, good looking kind of car.  The maintenance checks will be costlier, know that going into a purchase.<br><br>
