            It is amazing how fast digital cameras have developed over the past few years.  My previous Sony DSC-F505 proved that digital cameras could produce sharp images no less than conventional SLRs.  The Sony, however, lacked the capable metering system to tackle difficult lighting situations and its autofocus was rather slow.  I decided to buy the Fujifilm FinePix 6900 for several reasons.  The camera has very accurate color reproduction and very good metering systems that works well in many different lighting situations.  The camera design also allows for good firm grip and the manual focus ring is handy and accurate.  The 6900 also offers a variety of shooting modes which can be changed very easily via a dial.  Last but not least, this is one of few capable cameras that offer external flash hotshoe.

Although I�m not a professional photographer, I�ve studied photography for several years and have developed certain preferences and style in my personal work.   My format of choice is still 35mm (conventional roll film to you and me) although that might begin to change.  The Fujifilm FinePix 6900 certainly convinced me that the modern digital cameras are capable rivals of today�s 35mm formats in terms of colors, sharpness, and certainly convenience.  The shape of the 6900 takes on a more conventional SLR style with good grip on the right hand side and a big lens in the middle for your left hand to support.  Not that the 6900 needs that much support as it weighs less than it seems.

The FinePix 6900 is really a 3 mega-pixel camera, though Fuji�s Super CCD technology can interpolate the resolution to 6 mega-pixel with satisfactory results.  It is a nice feature to have should your need arises but I prefer the 3 mega-pixel native setting which produces sharp and detailed images.  The 6x optical zoom is very handy, though expect slight distortion at extreme focal lengths.  There are two ways to control the zoom, one by the controls on the side (when using a viewfinder), and another on the back (when using the LCD).  The 6900 offers 3 different metering systems (spot, average, and multi-zone) that are all very accurate under extreme lightings.  (Unfortunately that�s where many digital cameras fall behind, requiring tiresome adjustments in computers.)  It offers different shooting modes such as Programmed, Shutter-priority, Aperture-priority, Manual, and fully automatic.  Also available are the functions such as auto-bracketing and exposure compensation adjustments to suit your need.

The autofocus is quick and accurate but manual focus can take some getting used to.  The built-in viewfinder is a plus under outdoors use although the framing of the viewfinder is rather inaccurate.  Different ISO settings are also available from 100, 200, and 400.  The slowest setting, 100, can produce amazingly detailed images when the camera is mounted on a tripod.  The 6900 has a small built-in flash that works well for general use, though I prefer an external flash for night time use as it also saves the camera�s tiny battery.  Yes, the battery is rather small and weak.  It also takes 5-hour to fully charge a discharged battery unless you have a charging stand which takes only an hour to do the job.  It is recommended that you get an extra battery or two with this camera.

The FinePix 6900 stores images on SmartMedia (shipped with a 16MB card) that are far cheaper than comparable Sony�s MemoryStick.   It has a USB port which conveniently plugs into my Macintosh for fast transfers.  This camera has finally convinced me that the consumer-level digital camera has come of age.  It�s capable of producing satisfying pictures without the need of computer adjustments.  Thanks to Fuji�s expertise, this camera captures realistic skin tones, and other natural colors.
