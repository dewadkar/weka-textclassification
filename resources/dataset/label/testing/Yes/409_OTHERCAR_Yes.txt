            I wish I could afford to buy a Nissan Xterra.  It is, in my opinion, the best buy in SUV's on the market today.  It looks great, handles great, and returns to the roots of the SUV market.  Nissan has hit their mark with this one.  The Nissan Xterra has 2 available drivetrains; 2 or 4 wheel drive.  Both of these systems are very capable even off road.  The salesman I talked to at First Nissan in Simi Valley, Ca told me that his 2WD Xterra is still a great off road vehicle.  Put a lift kit on it and you should have no trouble with anything short of rock crawling.  If the 2WD system is that good, you can imagine how great the 4WD system is.  Power is supplied to the Xterra through either a 143hp 2.4L DOCH 16- Valve 4-banger with 154 ft-lbs of torque, or a 170hp 3.3L SOCH V6 with 200 ft-lbs of torque.  I do applaud the V6, but the 4-banger does not have enough power to get out of it's own way.  The Nissan Xterra has great features, such as waterproof seat covers, 6 bike racks, side steps, brush guards, a tubular roof rack with a gear basket (perfect for wet clothes), and most importantly, a first aid kit.  One thing that I feel was neglected on the Xterra was the rear fascia, which is really plain.  I think Nissan should mount a spare tire there to fix it.  Overall, the Xterra is a great SUV that should not be neglected when looking for a new SUV.  Like I said, if I could afford one, I'd buy it.  
P.S.- J.R.- Have fun with your new Xterra.  You know I'm jealous!<br><br>
