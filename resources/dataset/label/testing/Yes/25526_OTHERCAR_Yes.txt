            We bought this truck because my husband wanted a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  We were interested in z71, but the price turned us off.  We purchase a 1999 b3000 4 wheel drive king cab truck and are very pleased with its power, towing ability, and comfort.  It has an excellent stereo system and we have only encountered a few problems.  First we had a bolt come loose on the drive train which caused a vibration, we took it to the dealership and they fixed it.  The dealership also fixed a Cruise control that was recalled, but in the fixing made the windshield wipers come on when you hit a dip in the road, this provided several good laughs and has since been fixed.  These little set backs don't eliminate our joy of owning this truck.  You should purchase this truck if you are looking for full size power and ability without full size price.<br><br>
