                 What sold me on the QV3000 was the IBM microdrive, the fact that it holds so much still images for the money is cheaper than buying  the equivalant in 32 or 64 MB Compact Flash cards. I also liked the fact that it used Compact Flash verses Smart Media, Only Olympus goes one better in using both. But this review at hand deals with the ins and out of the Qv3000. 
     My first gripe is why they have no provision for a lens filter, anything to protect the lens. I know it ships with a lens cap but you know it's going to get lost sooner or later. I have "modifed" my QV3000 a bit for more useage, this included removal of the delicate ( you know this will break in time ) door on the side for connecting the USB cable to the pc for transfers of images. I did this because I use 2 external battery packs after quickly realizing that the 4 AA batteries do not last long at all if you start using the flash and the screen display ( even in  power saving mode ) plus the IBM drive consumes quite a bit if juice ( hey it's a hard drive after all )since it's running. So I now use 2 external 1200 ma rechargeable battery packs ( Nickel Metal Hydride )in rotation, and this has greatly extended my shooting time and allows me to loiter and not worry as much about battery life. 
     Which brings me to another point, with the Microdrive it also allow you to keep on shooting and make more shots, "bracketing" your shots and keep shooting without worrying about the capcaity of the flashcard. Indeed I usally shoot about 40 to 80 images ( full resolution too as I do not see the need to step down at all ) at a setting and later edit out the bad shots. Thats why bracketing is so important. As sometimes the camera will focus on the background and not the foreground object, I figure this is due to heavy center weighting of the autofocus, so care must be used as more than one shot has been out of focus due to this and the small 2 inch screen does not really show this, only when you dump images back to a pc for editing do you see what was out of focus, but for the most part I had a few shots out of the 800 plus full size images that I have shot so far, go out of focus, a few in broad daylight where there was shallow depth of feild and backgroud objects were a bit farther back so it focused on the background and a few in total darkness. But  I have learned to bracket and lightly depress the shutter ( to prefocus and set the exposure ) and then fully depress to take the shot. The auto exposure is really quite good on this camera with little correction needed ( besides there is Photoshop or your favorite application for this, one advantage for digital ). The flash settings do not seem to step down the flash much if any as I had tried all 3 settings and it seems flash output is consistent. The night shot setting works amazing well, with no grain effects, I do not know how sensitive the CCD is but I have taken night shot only with street lights and the exposure was dead on perfect, blacks were blacks, colors were vibrant.
     The zoom feature ( digital ) like all digital zoom features, shows pixelation. So I never use it after all if you got such hi resolution handy, why do you need to zoom as the level of detail is simply amazing. Most people have been impressed with my output ( especially when you print out to a an Espon printer ) as they have digital cameras but the resolutions offered do not make for anything beyond 4x6 shots, to stretch those shots to full 8x10 status looks pixelated. And I am one thankful that this camera is a true 3.3 Megapixel and not interpolated like others ( Fuji... ) that claim hi resolutions. This camera truly is hi resolution.Images are saved as compressed JPGs ( no TIFF output :( )so file sizes are "small" if you consider 1.2Mb per shot on full resolition ( 2048 x 1536 )small. Call me spoiled but I miss uncompressed TIFF files when I scan . As you fill up that Microdrive the time between shots ( lag time ) gets a bit longer. So it's best to frequently upload images to you PC to keep write times as fast as possible. The movie feature is very limited. I tried it and it was ok for small web stuff, but I bought this camera for the hi resolution still images, not for movies, Casio was better off leaving this feature off. You want to talk hi resolution movies, then talk the 3 CCD Canon GL-1 or  XL-1. :) The close up macro mode works well and amazingly no out of foucs shots.
     On the ergonomic front, more than once I had hit the  mode button thinking it was the shot button, this may be due to my large hands but I think Casio would have been wise to leave those button more recessed or off to the left more so the finger has a clear path on the shutter button. The zoom is ok for portraits or scenic shots, it's no Nikon but it does the job well for the duties at hand. Files transfers are simple and pretty quick via USB, I do not use there software to load nor do  I use there photo software, though it is very good and does the basics pretty well like remove red eye and gamma correction. I instead manually upload the images from the camera thruogh my file manager. The self timer gets a little getting used to. The tripod moint seems likes it's off center and off balance, but maybe that was were Casio decided to mount it and not obstruct electronics. Still the camera is light enough that once secured you will not have problems with it. I rarely used the optical rage finder, mainly because it lacks any inforamtion, instead using the LCD screen exclusively, thus draining battery power. USB support works well under 98 and ME. There might be issues with 95a ( it never had USB support from get go so blame Mircosoft ) and I have not tried it under 95b or 95c.
     In short I think the Casio is miles ahead of quite a few cameras in the same Megapixle range, becuase if the only for the fact that the IBM Microdrive plus the QV3000 makes the combonation unbeatable for the price ( IBM Microdrives are expensive ). Only the Olympus Camedia E10 has caught my eye as my next digital camera, sure it's 2000 bucks but it's a thru the lens focus that has really won me over and it uses Compact Flash 2 media ans supports TIFF! I have to wonder why no one else package the IBM Microdrive like Casio does as it seems ( battery run time aside )  like the solution to constant swapping of flashcards.

*** UPDATE ***

I still love this camera and taken it everywhere I go, but out of foucus shot still tend to be a problem with it. It now sell for $600.00 , $400.00 less than what I paid for it, under I think QV4000, and in black, but STILL no lens thread for filters, ergonomics are still the same. The camera works ( USB wise ) under 98Se, ME and 2000 with provided drivers. But under XP no driver is needed as XP set it up for me ( neat! ) as all I do is import the shots via my file manager ). The Olympus Camedia E-10 is down to 1500.00 dollars and I am am tempted, if not for the fact that Olympus does not reccomend the IBM microdrive with it due to the there concern of file corruption due to heat generated by the little drive, hmmm Casio has no problem with it nor does Canon and there excellent D-30.
