            I've only had my 2000 model Mercury Mountaineer for 4 days, and already it's the best vehicle I have ever owned.   In researching vehicles I compared this to the Ford Explorer, and it ended up being several thousand dollars cheaper for the same features!  I was able to get mine loaded, instead of a stripped down Explorer for the same amount of money.

The great features are an in dash CD &amp; Cassette Player, plus 6 more CD's handily located in the center console.  There is a programmable garage door opener in the visor, as well as a message center with which you can record 3 minutes of messages to yourself.  The message center is especially handy when you hear a phone number or web address on the radio and can't write at the moment.  

The temperature &amp; audio controls are located on the steering wheel, making it easy to change channels while driving.  The moonroof has a one touch button to open it, though I wish it had a one touch closing button as well.  I have leather seats in the car, which are comfortable and high quality.  They did not have a heated leather option as the Lincolns have and I do miss that.  The seats don't stay cold for long however, even in the cold Michigan winter.  

The cargo space is roomy, the back seats have a 40/60 split to fold down, so  you can still haul something and have room for 3 passengers.  

The few complaints I have about the vehicle are certainly outnumbered by the good qualities.  After only 4 days, I'm hooked and can see myself driving one of these for life!<br><br>
