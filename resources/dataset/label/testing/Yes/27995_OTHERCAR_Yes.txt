            To nobody's surprise, this is a fabulous car.  It's loaded with state-of-the-art technology, it's from a German manufacturer, and it retails for about $70,000 (The S8 is more like $90k, more on that later).

The Y2K model is virtually unchanged since 1995, when it was introduced (maybe a year earlier in Europe?  Forgot).  Well, the only changes are 10 more HP, new wheels, and now all the lights in the interior are not pilot-read, they have been replaced with a white-on-black theme.  Oh also the radio/climate controls are new too, vastly improved.  Bigger buttons, faster CPU control, easier to figure out.

This car sure looks the business.  Talk about classy, and talk about solid-looking.  It sure is solid, but Audi has managed to design this car as if it was carved out of a single piece of exotic granite.  Especially in certain colors (I saw one overseas that was this titanium metallic color, sort of goldish, very shiny, yet stark, not bright.  Oh my Godness you must see it with your own eyes.  It looked AWESOME.  Oops. Oh, that was an S8, so even if it WAS available as a color here, it would only be for S8s I presume, i am SURE it was a special color).  Of course you cannot go wrong with silver exterior (those Germans sure know how to paint silver eh?). 

Speaking of colors, and now for the interior speak.  Wow again.  Your dream HOME should look as nice as this interior.  The A8 hosts what is argaubly the most visually-pleasing center console ever.  Plenty of space for five, and fabulous seats.  Not as incredible as the BMW 16-way comfort seats, but close.  Huge HUGE trunk.  ery solid feel.  Try to get the interior leather color choice to not be black, as it hides the beauty.  Silver or tan!

Oh boy.  The drive.  The engine sounds fabulous, albeit not as good to my ears as the 540i BMW (identical to the 740i(L), but for some reason it sounds better in the 5).  It doesn't offer that much grunt below 2500RPM but boy does it rip to redline smoothly from there on!  The transmission I tested this with is the sportronic one, with +/- shifting.  Works well.  And I use a gimmick like that all the time.  However regular 5-spd auto mode is good enough.  Crisp shifts, and smooth.  You really feel like you are driving something with A LOT of engineering thought going into it.  There really is no comparison to a German V8, although yes, you do pay the premium for it.  Hey at least they OFFER it for those with the money.

Quattro.  The famed AWD Quattro.  While some say it's unnecessary, especially in today's day and age, what with sophisticated and reliable electronics controlling traction at the rear wheels and all, it does offer obvious benefits.  Awesome stability in the turns (when you are on the gas, otherwise it's useless), standstill acceleration in poor grip conditions, etc.  Of course it *is* extra weight to carry around (adversely affects braking, for example) and more drivetrain friction (so w/o it more of those 310HP could reach the wheels), but it's a great peace of mind to have.  And Quattro is perhaps the best AWD sytem offered.  Why?  Nevermind the computer control, the actual hardware used it what makes the difference.  *THREE* Limited Slip differentials (the obvious center one, Rear and Front).  What an LSD does it transfer power to the wheel the slips to the wheel the grips.  Having 3 allows the Quattro system to pull the vehicle out of the &quot;I'm hopelessly stuck!&quot; condition better than any other.  Why?  Because if there is at least one tire with sufficient grip, all power will go to it.  Comapared to the AWD system used by Mitsubishi for example, that only uses a Rear LSD (no front one) if just ONE tire up front lost traction completely, and BOTH of the ones in the back lost it as well, game over.  You're stuck.  But with the front LSD, the Quattro requires BOTH tires up front and BOTH tires in the rear to be slipping to get stuck.  Yes, more cost, more complexity, but the end results are what count.

Anyhow, the car skims through traffic effortlessly.  100mph feels like 40mph in your average car.  Brakes are very powerful, although I think the servo-power-assist is not consistent across the range of pedal movement and speed.  Damn good though.  

Safety? Goes w/o saying.  This was the first car to offer 6 airbags anyway.  It's all-aluminum, which means it's about 300 lbs lighter &quot;than it should be [if were made of steel]&quot;.  You might think this is a problem in a collision requiring fixing, but Audi has implemented a laser welding system in their factories that efficiently cuts out and replaces the damaged section of aluminum!  I saw a demo of this on the TV, very cool.

In the end, even with Quattro, I cannot recommend this car over say, a BMW 740i or 740iL.  The BMW is just better in more than one way, and then it boils down to whether you think the gracefulness of the Audi's shape inside and out wins your heart and head over.  Not me though, although I would love to own this car.  However!  There is an alternative...just not in the USA...

The Audi S8.  Ok, now we are talking!  *THIS* is the ultimate executive mobile.  Take an A8, throw on a sport suspension, 18 inch wheels, a 6-spd transmission, and 360HP, with special paint options, and you get the S8.  This car is worth your buying decision simply because it offers the world-class luxury that compares to the best anyone else offers, yet with a 6-spd tranny.  Uhm, if I had $90k to spend on another car right now...sign me up.  Err, actually I'd get an NSX.  Nevermind...

Ok, so you thinking of one?  Try out the 740iL.  Forget the new S-class (I'll review that later).  If you like the Audi for more than 1 reason over the BMW, get it.  But chances are the BMW will win, which is why they have sold a lot more.  Actually that isn't fair.  It's really in the name.  Audi was in serious trouble until the mid-90s range came out (new A4, A8, and now the new A6).  So people were skeptical of Audi, and so BMW reaped the benefits.  And Benz (that's a different story).

I wanna say you can't go wrong either way, which is kinda true, but we're talking about a lot of money here, yours.  Whether you hard-earned it or not, the A8 is easily worth your consideration, but the competition is FIERCLY excellent at the same time.  Nonetheless, this car sure deserves to sell more.  Also don't forget resale value (not as good as the BMW or Benz).
