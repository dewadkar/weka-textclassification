            My line of work in digital imaging, therefore I have critical eyes when dealing with images.
I've been taking pictures with 35mm SLR camera as long as I can remember, and laughed at digital cameras when they first came out, because the quality was so terrible.

I told myself that I would cross over only if,
1.  The resolution is at least as high as a film scan.
2.  Colors are as good as color slides.
3.  Prices are reasonable.
4.  Price of prints is comparable with 35mm prints.
5.  It's compact with professional features.

Well.. I finally broke down and bought at Sony P9 last week because,

1.  The maximum resolution of 2272x1704 is pretty close to a film scanner resolution of approximately 3000x2000.  To my critical eyes, 4x6 prints from 4 megapixel image developed in a professional lab is excellent.  5x7 is pretty good.  However, I can see start seeing digital artifacts in 8x10's.  Most of my photos from p9 is for general 4x6 snapshots anyway, therefore 4 megapixel is plenty good enough for such purpose.
2.  Professional photographers have been using slides for a long time due to their brilliant colors and contrast.  Sony tends to emulate the 'slide-look' pretty well.  Some people do not like such exaggerated colors in their digital images, but it was one of my criteria.  I don't know what kind of patent Sony has, but they definitely have that "Sony" look.
3.  A good 35mm Camera with a zoom lens costs around $500.  I paid $454 for Sony from a mail order company and another $60 for 128M Memory stick (Good for 65 pictures in the highest quality setting).  It's a little more than what I would like to have paid but I don't think they are going to get too much cheaper.
4.  4x6 prints made from a lab was very expensive compared to 35mm prints, but recently more labs are popping up, increasing competition, therefore lowering prices.  Local Costco store offers prints for just 19 cents a piece.  I have not tried them yet, but it can't be any worse than their so-so 35mm prints, which would be fine for general snapshot.
5.  I wish it had more manual control, such as manual shuttle speed, f-stop priority, and a choice of having either compressed/uncompressed file format,  but you can't have everything in such a compact camera.  I wanted it to be easy to use for my non-technical wife anyway.  It does a fine job in most of the settings.  It's not good for fast moving subjects, but I'll probably get myself a much bulkier 5 megapixel Sony if the needs arise.

I plan on bringing this camera everywhere we go.  Another big plus for this camera is that the underwater housing was just $170, enabling me to take it really anywhere &#150 swimming, diving, beach, boating, skiing, mud wrestling, etc.  
With a plan of using it for general 4x6 prints, we&#146ll be able to use this camera for a long time.  It will definitely pay for itself due to all the money saved on no printing bad prints, because every picture will be sorted and touched up before handing it over to the lab.
