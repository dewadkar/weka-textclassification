            You want comfort, a feeling of security and safety for you and yours, and you want an engine that gets up and goes? Then you want to consider a 2500 Suburban with the 8.1 liter engine. 

I have lived abroad for several years and I noticed that most countries do not have big cars.  Returning to America I wanted to return to a big American car firmly believing in the old adage that there is no substitute for horse power.  I also wanted a vehicle which had rear wheel drive as I learned to drive before front wheel drive was popular and in emergency conditions my responses are geared to rear end driven cars.  This alone eliminated many fine cars.  I also spend a lot of time in the car and the comfort of a large vehicle was a paramount concern of mine.

I took a look around and found that while I was out of the country most car manufacturers really got into front wheel drive. Some manufacturers do not even have a rear end drive car to their name anymore. So I started to look at SUVs with their "traditional" rear end drives. Not wanting to be a victim of buyer's remorse I thought to rent a couple of SUVs for a week each and took them on road trips.  The first vehicle I rented for a week was the Ford Excursion and I was sorely disappointed.  Not surprisingly, it drove like a truck, a big truck, and it required constant minute changes in steering.  After four hundred miles I was mentally weary. There is a lot more to say about this but let's save that for another review.  

Next I rented a 2000 Suburban with the 5.3 liter engine.  What a difference!  This SUV drives like a car and after the same four hundred mile trip (LA-LV)I was fresh as a daisy.  My only complaint was that the engine was too wimpy for my taste.  Patiently, I waited for the 2001 and the new 8.1 liter Vortec engine with it's 340 horses and a strong and flat torque line.  Further, I waited for the end of the year when I was able to get nearly $6,000 off the MSRP and $2,500 in further discounts because I owned a competitors product and had an e-mail discount voucher.  For my patience I got a top of the line fully loaded 2500 Suburban LT with the 8.1 for $37,475.

This SUV does indeed ride better than previous Suburban models.  The height of the vehicle gives an unparalleled view of what's in front of you allowing you to anticipate traffic in front of you much more easily.  Live with it for a week and then drive a regular passenger car and the feeling of insecurity can be acute. You just can't see as much and suddenly what used to be adequate seems so very small. The Suburban is quiet on the road and the handling is unexpectedly car like and easy to steer.  You do not have to constantly monitor your steering to keep this large vehicle going where you want it to. And the seats! They are sinfully comfortable with their power adjustments and heat.  Hold on a second! Heated seats?  Ok, I thought this might be useful for those who live where it gets cold but I live in Southern California.  How could heated seats be of use to me?  Oh, how wrong I was.  The heat is right in the small of the back.  You know, that little place which gets uncomfortable after a few hours of driving and drives you crazy with trying to stretch out the kinks?  Well, heated seats are a godsend for that little tiny spot, especially when it tightens up.  It is now my habit to turn on the seat as soon as the engine starts, regardless of how long my trip is to be.  In addition, the lumbar support and the adjustable "wings" along the sides of the seat can be adjusted for a "custom fit" to your body.  This seat actually seems to hug you!

The engine is all you would want it to be.  It is responsive and powerful and putting the accelerator pedal merely a quarter of the way down is enough to give you passing power in nearly every situation.  Cruising at 65 miles an hour the RPMs are at just about 2000.  To get this engine I had to opt for the 2500 which has a leaf spring in the rear instead of all independent suspension as found in the 1500.  So my ride is a little bit harsher than a 1500, but not by much, thanks to the Autoride which uses the onboard computer to adjust the suspension many times a second.  For the added horses the trade off was worth it for sometimes you need the extra power to get out of a bad situation and of course the car can tow 10,500 pounds since I have the 3.73 axle ratio. The 4.10 axle ratio would have given me a towing capability of 12,000 but my mileage would have suffered and the higher revs would have placed more stress on the engine.

To match the engine the brakes have been improved considerably and stopping is smooth and quiet.  The car is a 4WD but I usually drive it in 2WD mode but it can be switched to either 4WD high or Automatic at the push of a button and you can do it at speed.  (To switch to 4WD low you have to be stopped or going very slowly and be in neutral.) In Automatic mode the front axle is engaged but no power is put into it unless the computer detects the front tires slipping and then it goes to 4WD automatically.  This can be a real life saver in rainy and slick driving conditions but use it sparingly as the car does get a bit less miles per gallon in this mode.  

Speaking of gas mileage I can't really tell you what I am going to get yet as I am still in the breaking in period. During this time I seem to be averaging about 11 miles per gallon but this will go up when the engine loosens up and after it does I will put in synthetic oil.  Since the engine is so torquey I am hopeful that slow and smooth acceleration will make a difference in mileage as opposed to jack rabbit starts.  However, for the times when the jack rabbit in you just MUST come out and express itself you can hop pretty fast. In any case, for the power and peace of mind of a big rear wheel drive car with a big engine I consider the price of gas to be cheap insurance.  

There is a lot of bruhaha about the danger big SUVs pose when they crash into smaller cars. However, the accidents I have seen with my own eyes have shown me that the passengers of the bigger car usually come out in better shape that those in smaller cars.  As my concern is for the safety of myself and my passengers I'll take the bigger car every time and this seems to me a sensible position to take.  I drive defensively and cautiously but let us face it, not everyone does and those that do not drive carefully share the road with those of us who do. 

Cup holders galore in this car.  Two in the front, two for the second row and two for the third row seats.  And speaking of seats there is not an uncomfortable seat in the car.  Even an adult is comfortable in the third row as it is full sized in terms of seat and leg space.  Also the first and optional second row bucket seats recline for those long trips. The bucket seats in the second row make access to the third row much easier than the second row bench seats which are also available. The driver's seat has memory which can be seat for two drivers and the seats adjust to either of the settings at the push of a single button.  Also the second row passengers have the option of plugging in head sets and listening to something other than what the driver is listening to.

There are also three 12 volt outlets in the front, another in the second row and a third in the back.  More than enough outlets for mobile phones, computers, car ionizers, and whatever else one can think of.

My biggest complaint about the car are the OEM tires and this can be easily remedied.  I have Firestone Steelex Radial R45 LT 245/75 in 16 inch.  (Let's not even discuss Firestone and their continuing problems.) I am not comfortable with Firestone products. After talking to a lot of tire and Suburban people a popular solution seems to be to upgrade the rims to 18 or 20 inches and to put on tires appropriate to your type of driving, keeping in mind whether or not you want to go off road and/or drive in the snow.  The good news is that after speaking to my dealer he told me that the car's computer somehow calculates what size the new tires are and adjusts the speedometer to the correct speed. Bigger diameter tires should also increase gas mileage.  A good choice in tires could also provide you with an even quieter ride.  (If you plan to tow make sure your tires are rated for it.)

This car is high off the ground which gives you that great view but it also makes it difficult for shorter and older folks to get into.  Even the optional running boards don't help much for elderly passengers. (A Kodiak SideWinder Step which adds another step just below the running boards should solve this problem.  It automatically lowers when the door is opened and retracts when it is closed.)

The extended floor console between the front bucket seats is obviously made with the driver in mind as the front passenger's access to it is a bit difficult. The hinge to the floor console door is on the passenger's side and in the open position the front passenger has to reach over the door to get at things in the console. But on the plus side there is lots of room and little nooks for spare change, a tissue holder, and tons of space for your music.

Speaking of music, the CD/AM/FM/Cassette has a control which automatically raises and lowers the loudness of your tunes as the car speeds up or slows down. There are nine speakers including a subwoofer but the system sounds as good as you would expect of an OEM sound system.  In other words, if you want great sound you have to go after market but then I didn't buy the car for its sound system. 

I got the sunroof which does away with the easy access controls of the air conditioner system for the passengers in the second row.  The sunroof is easy to operate and there is no wind noise in the closed position.

Who should buy this car?  If you like big cars with big engines and grew up with rear wheel drive vehicles, consider this vehicle. If you drive long distances or carry a lot of people you should also consider this car.  If you tow a boat or trailer, consider this car with the 8.1 liter engine. (The trailer package is optional but I haven't seen a 2500 without it.) For family trips where there is a need for luggage space this car is hard to beat.  If you are concerned for survivability in a crash, consider this car.  However, if you are more concerned with gas mileage or the welfare of people in the other car that may hit you, get something smaller, save gas, and hope for the best for you and your family in the event you have an accident.  Me, I'm selfish and I put the safety of myself and those who ride with me foremost.  If that makes me a pig, than "oink".  Come on in, the mud is fine!
