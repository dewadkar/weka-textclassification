            Instead of 5 possible stars...I'd give the Intrigue 8 out of a perfect 10. I test drove/researched numerous vehicles before leasing my new 2000 GX and I am pleased with the decision.

POSITIVES; 

Great styling (even my 17yr old son likes it...with the wing of course)
Powerful yet economical engine (new 3.5 liter V-6)
Affordable price
Powerful stereo
Comfortable seats
Roomy trunk
Good handling, sporty yet comfortable ride
Eats up highway miles
Luxurious interior
Good value
8000 miles and nothing but an oil change (so far)

NEGATIVES;

Cupholder(s) not convenient
Engine noise can be intrusive under heavy throttle
Electro magnetic steering feel odd at times
Build quality not as good as most imports, minor things but still there<br><br>
