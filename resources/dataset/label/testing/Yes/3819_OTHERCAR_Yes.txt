            My wife and I purchased this car in June 2002 and we've basically been thrilled with it.  We wanted a larger car than our Chevrolet Cavalier, but nothing incredibly huge like your typical SUV.  In addition we have rough winters in Northeast Ohio, so we wanted a vehicle that would handle the snow with ease.  We also wanted something decent on gas.   
After researching Consumer Report's annual guide, we narrowed down our list of cars to look at.  It was no surprise that there were no "American" cars on our list, albeit slightly disappointing...  
After walking through several dealerships, we went to a Honda dealership in Buffalo and test drove the Pilot.  It drove very well, but it was way to bulky and expensive.  Plus, they did not have any CRVs available (a common story).  Next we hit a Toyota dealership to test drive the Camry, Highlander and Volkswagen Passat.  The RAV-4 is simply too hideous a creation to try out.  The saleswoman there was EXCELLENT!!!  She bent over backwards to help us.  The Camry drove like a dream and we were really impressed with its roominess, good looks fuel economy.  Both the 4 and 6 cylinders performed well.  It was a bit pricey and they did not have exactly what we wanted.  But I recommend testing the Camry; you will love it!  The Highlander felt like a minivan so that was out of the question (and it seems like the only color they make is gold).  The Passat was impressive looking at it and driving the 4-cylinder turbo was a blast.  But when I sat in the backseat I quickly realized it was way to small to be practical for any family of three with a dog.  I'm 6'-1" and my head hit the ceiling...  The dealer proceeded to take us to a Subaru dealership (her husband's).  To make a long story a little shorter, the Forrester was much too small in the back seat and the Legacy and Outback were overpriced.  Plus neither of them afforded the driver the "high view point" we wanted while driving.  
We finally went back to Mentor, Ohio and foud a dealer with CRVs.  The salesman was very nice and we took a spin.  It felt great!  Perfect size too.  But we would have to wait a month for more to arrive.  We went to another dealership in Ashtabula with the intent to buy.  They had one left.  This dealer we did not like at all however.  He would not negotiate and they did not have the car ready on the day agreed upon.  Nassief Honda seems a bit shady.  Nonetheless, we bought the car based on our previous test drive and Honda's reputation.  Plus the price was reasonable.
It has such a solid feel that's difficult to describe.  the 160hp 4-cyclinder engine provides more than enough zip.  Why do you need more power?  The rear leg room is more than ample.  3 adults fit tightly in the back b/c of lack of shoulder room, but this is the case with virtually every car.  One negative is the front right passenger seat does not go back very far so the leg room isn't the best.  The fuel economy is ok (25 mpg average), though we always wish it were better.  The six-CD/cassette stereo sounds great for a factory one.  And the CRV performed very well in the snow last winter.
Here are the real negatives so far.  We recently noticed rust (exactly one year after purchase) that Honda is partially fixing.  They claim that some was due to chipping from rocks.  Rust after one year is unacceptable.  Our 1998 Cavalier has none and it's five years old!  Also, we just started hearing a scraping noise on the right rear wheel; the rear breaks locked up and have worn already!  Honda's warranty only covers this until 15,000 miles.  Since we took it in at 18,000 it isn't covered!  Since Honda recommends you take the car in and change the oil only every 10,000 miles, how are you supposed to know this should have been fixed earlier?  I get the oil changed every 5,000 miles or so.
Anyway, the ride is great and there are a few problems that hopefully are not a sign of more occurring in the future.
