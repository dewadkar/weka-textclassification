            I love my DC4800 it takes fantastic pictures! As they advertise if you follow the instructions in the little manual you can take pictures in a few moments. The battery was charged in mine!

I ordered mine on line at 11:am on one morning and because of a special shipping deal they have I got it the next day! I was amazed.

I also had a Dc210 and thought it took great pictures and it does! A great point and don't think about and shoot camera! The Dc4800 is not that type, yes you can set it up for fully automatic and take really great high quality digital images. However in a low light situation the camera lens will be fooled and your pictures will not turn out well. The reason is that automatic will set the camera speed so slow it should be on a tripod. However you can compensate by turning the little button on the top and adding up to 2 full stops. In the other situation with too much light you can go 2 stops the other way.

I have had my camera for 6 months now and taken some of the best pictures of my life! I have not explored all the advanced features yet but they have opened a new world for me!

I have bought a larger card (48Mg)and the lens kit for my DC4800 so I can get 97 pictures in 3.1 m pixel compressed resolution.

Things I love about the camera. Easy to use if you read the manual! The wide angle lens in the lens kit. Picture quality and resolution. The USB interface. The ability to change the F stops on the the top of the camera for different lighting conditions with the turn of a button. Pop up flash, slide show ability and the menus for changing the camera setup.

Things that could be better. Computer software package, it works but i like the older version I have much better and do not use the software that came with The Dc4800. It sure would be great if it was a single lens reflex. The lens barrel does show in the window you use to focus! The time delay to set the focus (thats why most people get fussy pictures with it.)Focusing with lens kit on. You need to use the the display screen.

In summary: I love this camera and it has opened a whole new world of taking pictures for me. Kodak has a great website with tips and hints that helps. If you want a point and shoot camera and not have to think about the pictures or setting the focus etc this camera may not be the best choice for you! However if you don't mind thinking just a little and are willing to explore just a bit then this camera is for you and takes the best pictures I have seen in a long time! It certainly has great quality and is easy to use with a little study and exploration!
