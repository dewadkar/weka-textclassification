            I was on vacation and decided to rent the Honda S2000 for a few days.  The exterior styling of the car (in my opinion) is great.  It has very smooth lines and looks good from every angle.  Every since I saw the S2000 at the auto show I wanted to drive one.  The exterior fit and finish as well as the paint job appeared top notch.  

The inside of the S2000 is quite cramped for a person my size (6ft) - Not much head room, leg room, or arm space.  The trunk is very tiny and the only storage space is a very small glove compartment between the two seats.  I realize that this is the nature of this type of car but there are other small sportsters that seem to have much more interior room (Audi A4, Corvette, etc.)

The seats are firm yet comfortable and the steering wheel (though not adjustable) and stick placement are close to ideal.  I didn't think I would like the digital dash but after a while I got use to it and although I prefer Analog, I could live with the S2000 digital setup.  The controls for the climate control and radio are within easy reach of the driver and work well.  The radio and 2 tiny speakers are absolute crap; no bass, no volume, terrible quality, etc.  The carpeting in the s2000 seems kind of cheap and it is overused, wrapping around the center console.  The top operation is fast and easy with the flick of a up/down button in the center console, and locks with two clips to the front.  The rear window is plastic which distorts your rearward vision if you are driving with the top up (now why would you do that?)  

While driving the Honda S2000 you have your choice:  

Your first choice is to accelerate and shift as you normally do in your everyday car and you will not be too impressed (although with the 2.0 Liter 4-Cyl engine you might get pretty decent gas mileage).  At low rpms (that's like 5500 or less in this car) the car has very little power.  

You second choice is to rev the engine up (like you are suppose to in this baby) to the 5500 - 9000 range and listen to the engine come to life.  If you want to be ready to take off fast, you must keep the engine revved up high in one gear lower than you might normally drive in at that speed.  Not exactly like driving a sports car with a V-8 or V-12 at your disposal, but you have to give Honda credit for making such a small engine put out so much horsepower.

The best thing that can be said about the Honda S2000 is the FUN TO DRIVE factor. This cars handling is fantastic, the slightest nudge of the steering wheel and you have changed lanes, very tight.  The near 50/50 weight distribution of the S2000 allows for a lot of fun around corners.  The 6-Speed manual shifts flawlessly and the clutch throw is not too long or short.  

In summary, I think the S2000 would be great as a second car to go cruising with on a sunny day.  Is is the best drop top you can get for $32,000+ ???  For those who want a reliable little pocket rocket that looks good, is a blast to drive and has just enough power to keep up with the neighbors V-8 sports car (maybe), then the answer is YES.
