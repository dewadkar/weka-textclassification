            Let me first say I'm not an expert to photography. I'm more of a entry level advance user.  I own 6 cameras.  I started out with Nikon and ended up being a die-hard Cannon fan. The Minolta is my 2nd digital camera.  The first I purchased 3 years ago (Phillips/magnavox) and regret that because of the rapid advances in digital photography. 

I looked for a digital camera for about 6 months. I read everything I can get my hands on, reviews, magazines etc. Of all the info I read about digital cameras it came down to 3 things on why I purchased the Diamage 5.  

1. Howard Creech's Epinion review and his response to my questions on the camera.

2. DPReview: Digital Camera Reviews and News, the most comprehensive testing of all digital cameras on-line. Highly recommend going to this web site to look for info on digital cameras.

3. In store handling.  After all the reading and reviews, I went to a store and picked up a Minolta Dimage 5.

After all the reading, I had in my mind that I definitely wanted a Canon G1 or G2. It was the most highly rated camera on the market. It had the best features. But quite frankly when I went to the camera store, I picked up the G2 and instantly I did not care for it. I thought there was no grip on the camera. You may think that may be silly but if you drop a $800 camera especially a digital one , then you want something that will hold in your hand tightly. Along with grip there's comfort, the G2 was larger than I thought and I felt uncomfortable with it. I knew I would drop this. 

The salesperson handed me several cameras, I was most impressed with the Minolta's. The Minolta S304 I was particularly impressed with. When she handed me the Dimage 5 I instantly liked it. Maybe out of all the camera's it reminded me mostly of a well balanced 35 mm. It has a true 35 mm glass 7x zoom aspheric type lens. I like the fact that I can look at the LCD monitor and look at the electronic viewfinder. The LCD monitor automatically shuts off when you get with-in about 2 or 3 inches so you can look at the viewfinder. On bright sunny days you probably have to look through the view finder. 

I've had the Dimage 5 for 2 months now and I'm very happy with the pictures it has taken. Brillant colors, very sharp lines. Zoom is really impressive. One complaint is that the LCD viewfinder does not give you the "REAL" zoomed picture. It frames it accurately but your impression is that you are not really zoomed in. What I mean is, after I shot several pictures using full 7x zoom.  When I looked at them on pc, I was shocked to see how well the zoom did. 

Some reports revealed that the camera is somewhat slow to recover from a previous shot. It did not give me any problems. After reading the book, I found it was quite easy to work the camera. This is my first Minolta camera. I like the fact that the Dimage has a "mode dial" similar to most Cannons. This made it easy for me. I like the fact that this camera takes 1 minute video. Seems silly but I find myself taking a lot of 1 minute video's of my daughter and emailing it to my parents. They really get a kick out of it. Video is quite impressive. Although there is no sound. 

In flash mode you have to get used to the ability for the camera to adapt the amount of light level. When shooting indoors for example I was used to a 35 mm automatically using the flash thinking there is a low light condition. Dimage can handle a certain amount of low light with out flash. When the camera indicates shake or low light level then I use the flash other than that I don't and let the camera figure out the light level. This has taken me some time to get used to. 

I used this camera for a few Ebay auctions and it worked out great! One small problem was the ability to use the macro feature.  You first have to rotate the zoom lens all the way out to the macro setting and then lock in the macro and using the auto focusing or manual focusing you have to physically move the camera in and out to find the object in focus. I don't use macro very much though. 

I love the silky smooth manual focusing ring which is located on the lens itself.  I have used the manual focusing which I enjoy when the object is either small or the lighting is tricky when using auto focus. Again, I guess it's the 35 mm that's in me. I also love the instant menu review, just turn the dial to review and you can instantly review your pictures.  The full function manual overrides is fabulous. There is a wheel on the side of the camera called the function dial. It give you the power to have complete control over:

Exposure modes (which gives you control both shutter & aperture.)
Aperture Priority (you select the aperture and the camera selects appropriate shutter speed)
Shutter Priorty (you select the shutter speeds, camera selects the aperture speed)
Manual exposure (you select both shutter and aperature)

Image size: you can control how big in pixels you want the picture, from 2560 x 1920 to a low of 640 X 480, which is nice if say you are taking inventory or auction type pics where pixel size is important

Image Quality: you can control how fine the resolution is, from Supre fine (highest quality image to economy lowest quality image.

I highly recommend one those smart media/compact flash drives. You hook it into your USB port and you take your smart media or compact flash card out of the camera stick into the drive and it will transfer extremely easy. When transferring it with the camera, you tend to use up a lot of battery power or you have to hook up a ac adaptor and then go through the menu on the camera, it's much longer to do it this way. 

Batteries in the reviews seems to be a problem. I just carry a set of extra batteries and a charger. The charger will charge the batteries in 30 min. So far I have never had a problem with batteries yet. 
I purchased several compact flash cards with this camera. I actually just use one, a 256 meg compact flash. This gives me 356 pictures using a medium resolution which is fine. 

One small annoyance is the location of the strap ring. It's located just above the data door. 

All in all I highly recommend this camera. It is bigger than most digital camera's but the ease and picture quality is fabulous.
