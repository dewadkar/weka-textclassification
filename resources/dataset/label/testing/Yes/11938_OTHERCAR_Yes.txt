            Digital cameras were all the rage, the Stevenson family were newborns in this latest techno-hype. Based on a recommendation from a programmer friend, we purchased the AGFA 780c ePhoto.

Right out of the package we were in awe. It has a nice design and did not break the bank. It has two 8mb digital film cards. This is a bonus because you will be buying one shortly, when you go on vacation and need more room for more photos. The software is user-friendly. Downloading is simple. Corrections are simple and reverseable. The display on the camera is convenient, and allows you to make the decision to keep or delete. 

When we compared the AGFA 780c to other cameras we knew we did not have the top of the line. It lacks in memory capabilities, the image is less than top quality. But, when you look at the bottom end cameras, you may not get a pc film card at all, and you may not be able to preview your images without downloading. So for a middle of the line camera, we are happy with our choice. Oh by the way, all digital cameras should come with rechargeable batteries and a charger. Bottom end or Top end!!!<br><br>
