            My husband just had to have a new truck, we looked for months, he was set on red.  His brother had just gotten a new 1500 series, which is what he had only 2 years older so you know he couldn't let his brother have a better truck that he had.  My husband plays golf, fishes (bass), and hunts (alot).  Power is a big selling point, due to the fact we pull a bass boat, or 4-wheelers, or even a bob-cat around. This truck handles it as if nothing is back there.  I can even drive the truck with a trailer and lawn tractor hooked on and not have a problem.  We have 3 kids..so we need much room, especially when one is in a car seat..not a problem in this truck, we can carry all 3, diaper bag, book bags and a trumpet.  Or the car seat and my husband's golf clubs.  There is even room under the rear seat to stow smaller stuff if you are in a bind.  There are cup holders that fold out to the back from the console, there are vents for the back which is excellent.  We have leather seats which are soooo very comfortable.  The sound system is great. The a/c cools fast, I love being able to set the temperature for the inside of the truck.  The console in the middle of the seats is deep, which is good cause my husband carries much junk in his truck, there is even inserts for your change!! We have the allision transmission, which is awesome..although there is a little noise that comes along with the power, not enough to irrtating though, we just didn't expect it. The ride is better than we get in my top-of-the line minivan, and holds the rode great, even with a load on back!   The rear-view mirror has the compass and shows the outside temperature.  I forgot that the rear seat splits to fold down and provide room inside for luggage or whatever.  One feature that I think is worth its weight in gold is the on-star feature.  My husband drives to Wyoming each fall to hunt, which is a very long drive, with the on-star it gives me extra piece of mind that if anything happens on one of those loooong stretches of endless highway, he will be able to get help. I failed to mention we went will an all black truck and had the rails and bug guard added--for know, there are many things he wants to add but we were told the truck is too new and many of the accesories are not made for this truck yet.  The only warning I have, is watch the gas petal--this thing flies like a bat out of hades!!
