              i picked this camera up at sears earlier this month. i did a lot of shopping around, and this is the best camera i found in the $200-$300 price range. i got it for $249 (not including taxes) at sears.
  besides the floor model, it was the last one in the store (an amicable 'shark' found it in the back room and hid it for me because i didn't have any cash on hand - definitely earning his commission). i was told that they (sears) can't get any more of them. if you manage to find one, and it fits your needs, get it!

  the exterior:
  it's pretty much physically identical to it's higher resolution counterpart, vpc-x350. the case is fully armored with some sort of metal (which seems to be quite durable - see below), which is held in place with small screws. the insides of the camera appear to be plastic (but i haven't really checked). the lcd screen/viewfinder is good enough to give you an idea what the picture you just took looks like. the controls are simple and intuitive. turning it on is as simple as sliding the lens cover to the side. it's got features every camera should have (i.m.h.o.).

  amenities:
  it comes equipped (out of the box) with everything you'll need to use it. two pair of 'aa' sized nickel-metal hydride cells and a charger that fits a pair at once. charging time is usually between one and two hours. don't bother trying to use alkalines except in extreme emergencies. the camera sucks a pair of duracell 'ultra' dry in about fifteen minutes if you're using the display as a viewfinder. use the NiMH. buy extras and mark them as pairs if you really think you'll need them - they're getting cheaper all the time.

  the camera stores images on removable SmartMedia. it comes with a 4MB card. there is no internal storage memory, but an 8MB card is retailing for about $20 (which is far less than an equivalent amount of processed film, and can be used many, many times). i've read that the camera can use cards up to 64MB in size; i've just got an extra 8MB card. i use the 8MB most often, and the 4MB is a 'backup' in case i run out of room.

  the camera's flash is a little too intense for closeups (the manual even warns of this), and sometimes overexposes the image. yes, i said overexpose - the ccd is 'progressive scan', and can make some pretty interesting film-like effects when the flash is disabled. it's hard to get good pictures of fire or fast moving objects after dark, even with the flash. no u.f.o. watching with this camera...

  sanyo utilities (included on one of the two cd-roms enclosed with the camera) is very easy to learn. images can be downloaded one at a time, all at once, or selectively. the sound from the movies is copied in a separate file (i think conversion to .mov format requires a separate audio track - maybe it's some other format...anyway). i haven't done too much of the 'voice captioning' thing for stills. only used it once. funny.

  closing comments:
  i'd advise almost anyone to buy this camera. just be aware of what you're getting; if it's not for you, keep shopping. the resolution's not the greatest, but it's fine for snapping pictures of things for auction or your very own web authoring experiments (which are the reasons i got it), or anything you'd typically use a point and shoot camera for. the great 
thing is that it's digital - it'll pay for itself (because you're not exposing and developing and printing film - which can get expensive) in about a month if you use it as much as i have mine.

  if you're looking for something to replace your 35mm film camera, i'd suggest waiting a while for digital s.l.r.'s to come down in price (i'm waiting for an s.l.r. like nikon's to fall below $500, myself). if you have no idea what an s.l.r. is, but want a decent digital camera and have only a few hundred dollars to spend, you may want to get one of these while they're out there - especially if it's on clearance...

  comments regarding my particular camera:
  the fit of the battery/card slot cover was a little less than perfect out of the box (what can one expect from high volume mass production?). adjusting it until the metal pieces mated perfectly took only a few minutes. there are three metal tabs which hold the door closed. these can can be bent (*very* carefully) to adjust the force required to open the
door. there is a small rubber piece that protects the data and d/c power ports. mine doesn't fit the data port very well. no big thing, just a small design bug. it'll probably 'wear in'...

  anecdotal evidence of the camera's indestructibility:
  the camera fell out of my pocket and down a flight of stairs in the house yesterday. i thought the camera was doomed. as it turns out, the only real damage was to the stairs (which were dented). the battery door came open (and the cells were ejected onto the floor). the metal case picked up some wood (which came off when rubbed with an alcohol prep pad). the three tabs mentioned above needed to be bent back into position so the door would stay shut reliably. other than that, that camera seems to be just as always.  great little machine.  i want another as a spare in case i lose or manage to break this one...<br><br>
