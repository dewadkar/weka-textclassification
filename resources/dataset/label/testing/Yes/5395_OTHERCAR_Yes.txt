            I am writing about the A5 Powershot and not the A5 Zoom.  I purchased the digital camera last May, when the huge megapixel cameras were not due out yet. 
Still, this camera is indeed a mega-pixel camera...(1024 x 768 resolution) there is a review about it at CNET that convinced me to buy it half a year ago:

The camera is very convenient.  I use it to take regular pictures. It's basically my camera of choice for recreational purposes.  

The functions are very simple.  You can choose from Large, Small, Large-fine imaging, small-fine quality imaging functions.  The &quot;fine quality&quot; feature just adds more detail to the pictures.  And, consequently they 
take up more space.

You can take roughly 100-125 small pics, and 30-50 large pics on the 8 MB Flashcard that is included (you may want more memory if you take more pics, but you will also need more batteries b/c I always run out of batteries before taking all the pics).  
Varying which pics you want--large or small-- is no problem at all.

Aside from the fact that the battery may run dead before all the possible pics may be taken, the A5 battery is pretty good as compared to other cameras (e.g. Kodak).  It's the 2CR5 one ( I think that's what it is).  It lasts a while before recharging.  And you can actually, get more pics out of the camera (when the red light comes on and the camera eventually shuts off), by taking out the battery for a minute, shaking it, and putting it back in.  You can probably get another 5 pics in the large pic imaging function.


The A5 ZOOM does not offer rechargeable batteries with the camera. I think you have to buy an additional kit that costs a bit more.

The A5 lacks a zoom function that the A5 has.  It does boast a portrait function that does allow you to take pictures that are very close (maybe 5-12 inches away from you).  And they portrait pics color is somewhat distorted.

On the A5 you can instantly view and edit your pics.  Using the View or multi view  function, you can see multiple or single pics at a time.  And, can delete them if you wish.

Another quick and easy way to view your pics, other than uploading them, is to plug the camera into your own television.   The A5 includes all the cords to attach to the input/output of the camera.  This is a very neat and convenient function.

Another piece of advice:  you might want to try getting a flash card reader.  I was given one the other day by a friend, and the upload speeds are very quick as compared to the A5's (remember: the A5 is not USB, so it takes around 20 minutes or more to upload all your pics).


Pic color and quality are not as great as other cameras.  The A5 is not one of the above 2.0 megapixel cameras. The pixels are about 1.3 megabits. The S10 offers over 2.0 megapixels (2.1 to be exact and 1600X1200).

The A5 has been discontinued for unknown reasons.  Canon has come out with an A50 that I checked out at CompUSA the other day.  The A50 combines both the A5 zoom and the A5.  Canon has also come out with the S10 model which has a whopping 2.1 megapixels!!


Overall, this camera is small and sleek.  The A5 is definitely stylish.
Silver and metallic, you can fit it in your pocket and look as cool as James Bond when taking it out.
The A5 is a recreational camera.  Use it, upload the pics, and send to your friends.  It's a good time.  For more professional cameras, you definitely want more megapixels.  And, with the great choice out there, keep looking.  I hear the Nikons are pretty good, and are in high demand.  Buy.com was back ordered on them, as of last week.  Kodak's are the best digitals there are usability-wise.  They are simple and boast loads of function; and the upload time of the pics are fast b/c of USB
