            The 2001 Nissan Pathfinder is a great SUV weather it is used in the city or off-road.  You can buy the SE which is a lower end vehicle.  It has a two-tone paint job and does not come equiped with certain features like a sunroof, door molding, and memory seats.  The LE, which is a higher end version, is very nice.  This is the model I own.  The LE has power seats, sunroof, CD changer, memory seats, and 6 speaker bose audio system.  Both models come equiped with a 240 hp V-6 engine whic is very fast.  The acceleration is great below 60 mph but a little slower above that and also the engine is very quiet.  The SE has Yoko tires which are a little smaller than the LE tires which are Bridgestone Dueler H/T.  Both make the ride pleasent and are very reliable.  An option you can get on the Pathfinder is a tow package.  The seats a comfortable and the backseat is very spacious.  The Nissan Pathfinder 2001 is a great SUV and good looking.  A great buy for just over $30,000.  <br><br>
