            I love my Montana in every way but one.  It has small seats.  However, let me qualify this statement. I am almost 6'5, and my brother is just about 6'7.  We are both very large even when we're lean, and we're not lean right now.  So, the seats feel very small to both of us, mainly in width.  They also don't seem to be of the highest quality.  I'm a bit worried that they will not have a long life.  My wife, at 5'6 thinks they're just fine, and since she is the main driver of the van thinks it is great all around.  I notice the seats in the Ford Windstar are much more comfortable, but I didn't want a Windstar. So, that's my only beef.  I certainly recommend this van to everyone.<br><br>
