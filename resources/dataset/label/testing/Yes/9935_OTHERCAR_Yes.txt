            I bought the MX6 LS 93' in 95, it's beautiful car with a v6 engine.  I love to look and drive this car.  I learned how to drive the stick shift on this car, and it was so easy.  The engine is very smooth.  After I installed a set of headers, it wants to rev to the red line very quickly.  I can do 60 mph in second gear in this car, and I can almost stay up with a Mustang GT:-)  I did not like this car when I start to upgrade it, there are not much after market parts for this particular car.  I did manage get a air intake, some exhaust, and set of shocks and springs.  It handles better and beg for some bigger wheels and tires.  If anyone can live with the stock, it's an excellent sports car.  If you want something faster get a Honda Civic or Prelude.  Unless someone makes a supercharger or a turbo for this car!<br><br>
