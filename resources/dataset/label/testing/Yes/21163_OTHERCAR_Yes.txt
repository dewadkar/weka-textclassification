            Since Lexus' introduction, they have been known as the sensible luxury car maker with build quality that is simply unrivaled.  Well, a few years ago, Lexus decided to change this image when they came out with the GS model line. 

The GS is a far cry from previous models that preceded it.  No, the build quality hasn't fallen, rather the fun factor has risen.  Lexus finally realized that there is a market for luxurious four door sedans that go fast and handle well.  They completed this mission through the GS series, and because of it Lexus has become synonymous with the likes of BMW and Audi.  

I drove the GS 400 recently and I wasn't ready for the cheek-tearing grin that this car planted on my face.  I had heard plenty about it through the various car magazines I had read, but I didn't quite believe what they had to say about the car.  See I was used to the Lexus of old, particularly the LS 400.  I had driven the Lexus LS 400 extensively in the past few years because my dad has leased the same car three times!  Now there is nothing wrong with the LS 400, it just isn't an exciting car, it is more of a relaxing cruiser, almost a yacht if you will.  That was definitely not the case with the new Lexus.

The first thing I noticed about the car was it's odd shape, I know it's been out for years and all, but you don't quite realize how oddly proportioned it is until you closely inspect it.  Once you are inside the car, the weirdness ends. In classic Lexus fashion, the car is covered in fine materials, soft leather, thick carpets, etc.  The car is also deadly quiet due to the amazing soundproofing that Lexus does.  That is where the similarities end. 

The engine is a silky yet powerful V-8, 300 hp variation that is used in the LS 400.  Simply, it is a Camaro killer under refined skin.  I left massive patches of rubber whenever I mashed on the pedal (of course I had the traction control off).  The eerie thing about the car was the fact that you never actually hear or feel the full power of the car in the cockpit, you only hear a muted monster, so each take off is as surprising as the one before.  Basically, this car's engine is FUN!!!!   

Well, I knew the car was fast now, but could it handle?  Yes.  Maybe not quite as direct and connected as a BMW, but every bit as fun.  This car can be tossed around just as hard as any sports car out there.  The driver always feels in control of the car, despite the moderate understeer.  At the same time, it was civilized during normal driving, almost to the point of the LS 400, but who buys a car like the GS 400 and drives it as if it were a boat?  

The GS 400 is just a blast all around.  It is fun and stills manages to be civil when asked to be, but I beg you, don't ask.  This car is just too sporty to be driven like that.  If I was BMW, I would be worried, the next update of the GS may take them off their pedestal.  We'll just have to wait and see. <br><br>
