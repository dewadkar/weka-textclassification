            My family has purchased a Dodge Grand Caravan on two seperate occasions.  We have been very impressed.  Dodge has produced one heck of a tight ride.  The family can go cruising down Sunset in style.  Then if you need to pick up a delivery you only have to make one trip.  The rear seats come out so you can fit approximately 500 lbs. and put it in meat locker boxes.  Who is going to suspect you trafficking in a Caravan?  It also gets excellent gas mileage.  You can make runs to Mexico on two tanks of gas.  Most importantly, if the unthinkable were to happen the Caravan has wicked get-up.  My grandma had our van to 110 mph and thought she was doing 55.  This ride does it all.    <br><br>
