            The G2 is probably obsolete since the new G3 is out but I guess bargain hunters will still be interested since the price drop on this baby is looking good.

When it came time to get a digital camera I was looking for something with  4 -5 megapixels. Finally gotten tired of processing film and scanning photos. You can consider me an advanced but increasingly lazy photographer, I got tired of dealing with manual focus, changing bulky lenses, exposure compensation, and all that other stuff I slaved over when I thought about majoring in photography. I just needed a picture taking machine that could handle most situations and easy to load onto iPhoto. Considered getting the Leica Digilux, but there were constant production delays and early preproduction models had horrific noise problems. The Canon G2 had the best mix of price and features so I got that.

This thing is a fully capable camera. Macro is great, continuous mode is good for action. There's over a half dozen exposure modes to choose from, I usually stick to program or apeture priority. Full manual is a handy option to have too for those who desire total control of the image taking process. The swivel LCD offers a lot of flexibility. Get a large CF card (256-512 MB) and you won't have to worry about storage, at medium setting I get an average of 300  images on the 256 MB.

Image quality on the G2 is excellent, color saturation is great, the metering system is accurate in 99% of photos I have taken. The three autofocus points gives the user more control of the composition, although I could have used a five or seven point spread to better effect. 

If canon could take all of the features and capabilities of the G2 and squeeze it into something that can fit in my shirt pocket, that would be the perfect camera. As it is now, it can be a chore to carry around. I don't like having cameras hanging around my neck at family functions. Plus the styling of this thing looks like a clunky $200 point and shoot zoom, c'mon now, I paid close to $650 for this thing, make it look like it or make it super small. Shutter lag on this is horrible at times, I've missed dozens of crucial photo ops because of the slow autofocus, or the two second delay after I press the shutter, now I've gotten used to setting it to the continuous exposure setting for important photos which allows you to shoot a series of frames which is saved onto the buffer and written to memory after the burst.
