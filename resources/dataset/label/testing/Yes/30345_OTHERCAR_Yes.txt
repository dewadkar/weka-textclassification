            The <B>Argus DC-1500 Digital Camera</B> is a decent digital camera for the money. It is inexpensive, yet takes fair quality pictures.  The main feature I don't like about this digital camera is the lack of a flash. You can only take pictures if the lighting is good.

The <B>Argus DC-1500 Digital Camera</B> can be used as a two-way still camera and PC camera. You can select high or low resolution, depending on the quality of pictures desired. This is an important feature to me because sometimes you need to weigh the difference between quality and quantity with a camera that has no removable memory. The <B>Argus DC-1500 Digital Camera</B> also has AVI movie capture of up to 8 seconds, and stores up to 80 images.

The <B>Argus DC-1500 Digital Camera</B> connects to your computer using a USB high speed computer interface. This digital camera comes with everything you need for short movie clips and high resolution digital photos. 

Included with this <B>Argus DC-1500 Digital Camera</B> were the software and cable to connect the camera and download all of my photos and movie clips onto my PC. This is very convenient whether emailing pictures or posting them onto a webpage.

I really like that this camera holds up to 80 photos, (or 8 seconds of internet compatible movie clips) in it's internal memory. Many cameras don't hold nearly as many as this one and the quality is fairly good if you use the high resolution setting, especially for a camera as inexpensive as this one.

This is a good digital camera for the price, and I would recommend it for older children, beginners, or anyone who does not need high quality photos.
