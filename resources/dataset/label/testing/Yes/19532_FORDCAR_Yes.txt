            My previous car was an rx-7, and I own a montero sport LTD, so thats my comparison base. For a sports car, it drives pretty smoothely. It doesn't drive like a family sedan because it aint But it isn't 'sports car rough'. 

Suspension is tight enough to inspire confidence in cornering on twisty roads which makes it fun to drive, but it is a bit 'heavy' which means maneuverability in town takes slightly more effort. (Handling may be better on mine because of upgraded 16inch rims with low profiles)

The interior is really noticeably cheap. I didn't expect much for under 20grand but c'mon. The stereo system is lousy. It is really a poor excuse to find such junk in a car with such good looks. I couldn't pin down the reason why the stereo sounded so horrible but it's partly because the tweeters don't produce sharp highs and the base speakers in the back are really sorry. Mostly, the sound system is all about mids. I keep it turned down low until, I can get a pair of umphs and an amp to save it's sorry soul.

But it's a head turner alright. Aint no doubt in my mind. Insurance is on the high side, although my record is spotless, I am still forking out $480.00 per 6 months with a 500 dollar deductible. This is texas, and besides, a 200 dollar deductible calls in an extra 100 or so.

If you are looking for this car to hiss out of the starting blocks with wheels melting the asphalt, look elsewhere. But it does pull smoothely without hesitation. Acceleration is solid but not brutal - it's not an rx-7.

Braking is a bit weak. I get the feeling that I must make an effort to brake. It doesn't inspire much confidence for sudden stops. I'm sure it will stop, but I'm saying it doesn't transfer that feeling effectively.

For a sports car, the back seats are good enough. It's not a sedan so much shouldn't be expected. I lugged my wife to the airport with 3 full suitcases, but I swear to you, I couldn't wedge a paper clip in there if I wanted to carry more stuff. 

One big thing I didn't like is the front seats are really uncomfortable for big people. I'm 230lb and I feel like I am sitting on top of the seat rather than in the seat. My wife, half my size, has no complaints what so ever. I recently got the seat adjusted to a position that makes me feel comfy by mucking around with the silly (ergonomically challenged) buttons at the bottom of the seat. 

All in all, I bought the car because of bang for the buck. I must admit, the base model comes loaded with all sorts of niceties, not the least of which is the driver side power seats (didn't even get that in my montero sport LTD). I don't race or drive insane so speed and brute force is less of a factor to me. If you have similar tastes like I do, the mustang is for you. Otherwise go get some more money because you will need it for that 'other car'.
