            Alright, Im gonna start this off by saying two things:
1. I havent written an epinion in a year.
2. I write kinda free verse, so dont get all upset if Im missing punctuations and such...

 I would also like to say that Im gonna avoid getting to much into the technical mumbo-jumbo, because if you were looking for that, you should be reading Car and Driver, not epinions..
 Ok...I own a 1998 Honda Prelude Type SH.  It is light years better than the Chrysler Sebring coupe I used to own. (shameless self plug: read my review on the Sebring)  The greatest thing about this car has got to be the BMW-esque handling capabilities.  For those of you who dont believe the precise-ness of that statement, chew on this:  The Prelude SH has a Lateral G of .90; a Bmw Z3 has a lateral g of .90...point proven?.  Though the car is a little fat(meaning: heavy), it is very, very nimble.  Body roll is almost non-existant and this creates some interesting situations.  For one, you will be able to do those pretzel on ramps at a terrifingly fast amount of speed.  The car wont budge...You will be plastered to the window, but the car wont budge.  Secondly, you will be able to power slide the car(note: Im talking about the SH here, I do not know the handling characteristics of the less sophisticated base model)  The ATTS gives the car the feel of rear wheel drive.  This means that when you are in heavy cornering you will feel the back end begin to come around, as opposed to having the front end plow outwards like most front drive cars.  Of course, this means that if you try to turn under heavy acceleration, you can spin out...the first time you get the car 45 degrees you will nearly have a heart attack, until you realize that you can ease it back around... Regardless of driving style, the handling is found pleasing.  The good news for everyone is that this car comes with progressive rate springs.  This means that your car will have a very tight and stiff ride when under heavy driving conditions, but will be very comfortable in normal ones.  I gotta say, its just fun being able to move around very easily in traffic.  This car will not scare you, it is very well balanced and even...
Ok, enough about the handling, but I can promise you, its worth driving once just to experience it...
   As for the engine, the car comes with a Robust 200 hp 2.2l inline 4.   Thats a lot of ponies for a small car, but sadly, the torque numbers are quite lower.  The car will not feel like your cousin Steve's 68 Camaro when you slam the gas down, theres just not that much get up, but it does accelerate very quickly for a 4 cylinder...  I would definitely suggest getting the Manual transmission if you Dont get the Type SH(which automatically has the stick) becuase that gives you more freedom with the power youve got.  Before the all mighty VTEC kicks in, its gonna be a little sluggish, but once that bad boy warms up, then the car will take off.  If you have the automatic, you cant pin it till redline, or get those great jumps when ya floor it..Plus, its just so much fun to drop it into third, watch the tach hit 6000 and pass someone in a heartbeat.
   Moving on again, this car is relatively cosmetically pleasing.  The exterior is very attractive, yet not too wild to scare off older buyers.  This is not just a Teenagers car, as the price tag will attest.  Unfortunately, the only two downsides to this car are the bland interior, and the lackluster paint job.  Dont get me wrong, the interior is very functional, it just looks way to much like a Civic.  As for the paint job, It looked great when i bought the car, but the clear coat was not very good, and the car faded in some areas, and showed very bad water damage...My suggestion is to enjoy the car for a few years, but dont be surprised if it loses that shine..
  To conclude this mess, If you kinda like the way Prelude looks, you should drive it, because that will make you love the car...  If you hate the way the Prelude looks, you should drive it, because that will make you respect the car...
All in all, there isnt a more entertaining car out there for the price.(condolensces to the Integra Type R:$25,000 and the Celica Gts: $26,000, you guys just cant be found under 20 grand yet...)
