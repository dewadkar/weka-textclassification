            I purchased the 1998 ML320 Mercedes Benz because it was named a &quot;Best Buy&quot; in several articles I had read.  First mistake - don't believe everything you read.  Second mistake - don't ever buy a car when it is in it's first production year.  I was told by my Mercedes dealership service repairman (we've become quite close over the past year) that this model has a few &quot;bugs&quot; to work out.  Does the word &quot;plague&quot; mean anything to you?  Fortunately, they have been minor repairs, but lots of them, nonetheless:

2 trips to the dealership to replace the stripping that kept falling    off the side.
4 trips for broken cup holders.
2 trips for light in glove box that wouldn't go off.
2 trips for gas cap flap being stuck.
2 trips for alarm going off whenever it felt like it.
1 trip for broken knob that controls side mirrors.
2 trips for routine maintenance.
1 trip for rope tied around break line (not their fault - neighbor kid).
1 trip I couldn't make to dealership because car wouldn't start -  resulted in new battery being installed (I'd had the car a week).

Why don't I just trade it in?  Because they won't take it - they don't want it either!  Seriously, I like it fine when I'm not driving it 30 miles to the nearest dealership.  That is, when I'm able to.  Twice the gas cap flap wouldn't open and I had to call the &quot;emergency roadside service&quot; which, thank heaven, Mercedes provides.  And then there was the nasty incident where it wouldn't start for two days.  Thank heaven those quirks have now been (hopefully) resolved and I am starting to like the car more.  It drives beautifully, the kids love it, I feel safe in it.  Fortunately, no major problems, and everything has been covered by the warranty.
