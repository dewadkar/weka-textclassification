            I have just purchased my first new car, a 2003 Honda Civic EX Sedan with side airbags (automatic).  After driving a failing 1996 Hyundai Accent with 3 out of 4 cylinders working, the Civic has quite a lot of zip.  

My first test drive was the EX Coupe (automatic) with the silver exterior and gray interior.  I was very disheartened by the test drive.  The interior materials looked cheap.  The air conditioning was terrible (to be fair this car had been on the lot all day in the direct sun in Houston, TX with an outside temperature in the mid-90s).  The ride felt like the equivalent of a late 90's Neon.  I was too tall for the car as my head was no less then an inch from the windshield.  I am only 5'9"!  

My second test drive was the EX Sedan with the red exterior and beige interior (they call it ivory).  

Overall impressions:  
The minute I sat in the car, I noticed the interior did not look cheap.  The beige makes the car look classy.  

Ride:
Once on the highway and bumpy roads, the ride was noticeably better.  While you still feel the bumps (it is an economy car), they are much smoother then any other car I have driven but the 2003 Impala.  The acceleration is very fast for a car of its size highway or otherwise.  Of particular note is the entrance ramps for highways in southeast Texas are quite short compared to other areas of the country.  I had no problem merging on to a full highway and I wasn't pushing the car too much.  I have yet to notice the jerkiness described by others with the automatic transmission.  

Comments of standard 'features':
The CD player/radio is ugly, but who buys a car for the stock stereo?  The air conditioning is spotty--if the car has been in the sun it takes a good five minutes for it to really kick in.  My Accent only took 30 seconds.  But I have read this is a consistent problem with Hondas in general.  The moonroof helps take care of this by quickly "airing out" the car.  The moonroof with power feature is a big bonus.  When not in use, a shade is available to keep the sun out or give the impression of more room in the vehicle.  I like the blue instrument panel, especially at night.  The door that covers the cupholders--a nice touch.

Seats and driving position:
The seats are very comfortable, especially for me at 5'9".  I have had a rider in my car who was over 6'3" and he was also comfortable with adequate leg room in the passenger seat.  The backseat is small.  I don't think I would want to sit back there, but this is not a concern for me.  With the ability to move the driver's seat up and down and the ability to move the steering wheel, I have been able to find the perfect position.  I can't imagine anyone not being able to be comfortable driving this car.

Biggest pros:
Honda reliability, ride, standard features, keyless entry, beige interior

Biggest cons:
Air conditioning, cheap stereo, grey interior

I also took the 2003 Toyota Corolla LE on a test drive.  My first impression at the actual dealership was quite different then my impression at the Honda dealership.  Someone was in my face the second I entered the building.  I guess that is the way Toyota trains their salespeople.  Also, they would not let me drive on the highway.  What kind of test drive doesn't let you out on the highway????

Anyway-the Toyota Corolla is about the same size inside and out as the Honda Civic Sedan.  I was just as comfortable inside the Corolla size-wise.  However, the driving position was very uncomfortable!  The interior has a much cheaper look.  The white backed instrument panel is ugly.  Also, I have found that when shopping for a car, Toyota ALWAYS puts 'extra mile' plans or other such nonsense like vin-etching on their cars the minute they are off the truck.  I wanted a car that just had the standard features.  No extra features, no rip-off vin etching.  And I wanted ABS, which isn't available on Toyotas in Texas without specially ordering through the dealer.  Honda, on the other hand, you can very easily get a car with just the standard features.

In conclusion, of the 2003 Honda Civic EX Sedan/Coupe (automatic) and the 2003 Toyota Corolla LE (automatic), I think the best choice was the Honda Civic EX Sedan for what was important to me--reliability, standard features, ABS brakes, safety.  I purchased my 2003 Honda Civic EX Sedan with side airbags a few days ago.

I will post an update in 6 months to give my impressions of the car at that time.
