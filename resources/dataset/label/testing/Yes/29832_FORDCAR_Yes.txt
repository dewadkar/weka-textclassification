            I own a 1996 Ford Escort, I love it. Even though a 4 door it is still small enough to fit into the smallest parking space, which means alot to me. If your looking for a car that handles great in the winter, this is your car. This car is the most reliable car I've owned yet. I bought it used and though 4 years old I havent had a single problem with it yet. Also though small it is still quite roomy. I think this car is an all occasions car, good for family, teenagers just starting out, or anyone. Also has an awesome heating system!!<br><br>
