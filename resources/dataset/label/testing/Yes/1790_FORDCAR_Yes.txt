            I was not a mini van type! I did not want a mini van.  Our friends bought an Aerostar.  They raved about it.  

Then my husband's vehicle was totaled by a drunk driver.  We were suddenly in the market for a new to us vehicle.  He convinced me to look at vans.  My friend told me to make sure we got one with air conditioning in the rear, the aerostar does.  She told me she wished they had the extended version.

We went looking.  We looked at every type of van on the market I am sure. We then stumbled across a green 1993 Ford Aerostar extended.  When we took it for a test drive I was impressed at how well it handled compared to some of the others we drove!  I liked the good visibility and the comfortable seats. Loved the power windows.  Loved the heat/air conditioning front and rear controls!   I wished the glove box was bigger! I liked the amount of seating! We could have two carseats and still take passengers!  We bought the Aerostar!

The gas mileage is awful when compared to the Toyota Camry we had been driving but I supposed that is to be expected.  We were a bit concerned about how it would handle in the winter.  But we've had no problems! 

One feature I would have liked to have had is dual sliding doors.  If you have 2 in carseats it is a bit of a hassle with the one door.<br><br>
