               It's really kind of funny, Honda Civics with barely 92 hp on tap get more respect than my lighter, faster Swift GTi with about 100 hp. That is until they get swatted.

The Swift GTi:                                             
   Just picture a Geo Metro with fog-lights, ground effects, 4 wheel disc brakes, 14 inch wheels, and a 16 valve 4 cylinder engine. That's the basics. Suzuki took one of the most basic economy cars and made it interesting. Not too much different than a Mini-Cooper in my opinion.

The Good:
    The engine. A high revving (for when it was built) Dual overhead cam, 16 valve, fuel injected tiny hot rod. Way overengineered for this car. I can't imagine anyone getting one of these with an automatic (Toyota derived 3spd)because it wakes up relatively late. Below 3000 there really isn't any torque or horsepower to speak of. Keep your foot in it and the engine wakes up above 3500 and the tach sweeps fast. Grab 2nd gear and show that CRX si what the back of a Suzuki looks like. Got a corner? Go ahead stuff it in. 185/60R14 tires and front and rear sway bars keep the car on line with a minimum of understeer inherent to front wheel drive cars. Speaking of front wheel drive, to minimize torque steer the GTi has equal length driveshafts. Don't worry about revving it so high all the time. It can take it. Steel forged crankshaft, self adjusting valves. Nippondenso fuel and ignition system just like a Toyota's... With minimal maintenance I have over 150,000 miles on mine with good compression in all 4 cylinders still. The brakes last a long time. They should, they are almost identical to the 4 wheel disc brakes used on the heavier mid to late 80's Honda Prelude. Gas mileage is ok, I really expected more but have been unable to coax 40mpg out of it no matter how I drive in spite of the dimunitive 1.3 liter engine. Previous Suzuki's that I owned could always exceed 40mpg when driven conservatively. On one occasion I got over 60 mpg with my previous SOHC Swift GA and a good tail wind. The GTi takes 87 octane gas without a bit of complaint or any knock so don't even bother with the premium. (It actually feels slower with 93 to me)

The Bad:

   There are some bad points, mainly the quality of the interior door handles. They have all broken at about 100,000 miles. Parts are availiable from your Chevrolet dealer but the Geo Metro variant has a different color interior. Still to save money I got the light grey handles. The window regulators come from the factory dry. I pulled off the interior panels and lubed all the moving parts. Voila'!!! smooth working window cranks. The door striker bolts work themselves loose so I loc-tited them in place. The car got a lot quieter. Minor inconveniences but they should have been addressed at the Canadian factory where it was built. The muffler rusts out at about 60,000 miles, probably sooner in the snow belt. I put a Walker Dynomax Turbo muffler on for about $50.00 and haven't had a problem in nearly 100,000 miles. The Dynomax is intended for a Swift/Metro without a rear sway bar so a little bending of the mounts is necessary for clearance but it sounds good, not as loud as most aftermarket turbo mufflers. All three of my Suzukis (Turbo Sprint, Swift GA, and the Swift GTi) have had these problems. My most recent failure is second gear. Probably more my fault from abusive shifting practices. The shift dog is likely bent now and second gear has to be held firmly in place. I am not too disappointed. It happened right at 150,000 miles. I know a lot of Hondas that have similar failures at or around the same amount of mileage from harsh abusive shifting. 
    Another reviewer mentioned that she had problems defogging the windows. Most cars turn on the A/C compressor on when the defroster/fogger comes on. The evaporator core dehumidifies the air and the fog is gone. The Swift requires the driver to push the compressor button. Not too difficult and it works great. The rear defogger works great too but the rear wiper has got to be one of the noisiest ever.
   Rear seat room. Ok so just fold down the split rear seats and pretend it's a two seater. They are pretty unusable by anyone over let's say 5 years old. At least there is plenty up front. More leg room and better pedal spacing than a Saturn SC2. I am 6'3 and no problems. Can't say the same for my girlfriends Saturn.


The Ugly: 

 It is easily confused for a Metro. No respect.
