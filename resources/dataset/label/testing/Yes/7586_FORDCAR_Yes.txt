            My 1998 XLT 2WD model has served us well with 35,000 miles driven so far.  We got the small engine, rear air, CD changer, leather, and 3rd seat.  

Likes: Lots of room, good CD/radio, quiet ride, good view, quick steering in town.

Dislikes: Underpowered, 99's have more power for both engine sizes.  Seats, as the 5th Ford product in a row that I have purchased, I'm convinced that Ford seat designers have never driven anything else to compare. Transmission, if it would only make up it's mind which gear to be in (also related to inadequate horsepower).  The 3rd kid's seat is a back killer to install and remove without tearing the carpet. No cup holders for the second seats. 

Problems: Parking brake pedal has a defective switch/travel limit-brake light remains on.  Rear wiper only works when it wants to. CD player progressively got worse and now only skips instead of playing. Some kind of graunching noise on large bumps from the front end.

I am confident that the dealer can/will fix above problems.<br><br>
