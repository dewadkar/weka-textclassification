            I purchased a new Saturn Sl2 in August 1996. I needed a reliable car that was good on gas mileage because I drive 100 miles a day round trip to work.
That is exactly what I got when I made this purchase. The car got over 30 miles to the gallon. In the course of three years I put 126,000 miles on vehicle. During this time I made zero stops at the repair shop. When I traded car in it still was all original. The brakes were even still good. I changed tires at 103,000 miles. The car had very good sound system, good air conditioning ,and comfortable seats. After about 70000 miles the car developed a few rattles and squeaks, but not too noticeable. The engine is very peppy and it is fun to drive. The car corners as well as stops good. The car is loaded with safety equipment. It has dual airbags, anti-lock breaks, and side impact bars. 

I would recommend this car to anybody. When I traded it in, I traded it in on a 2000 Saturn SL2. <br><br>
