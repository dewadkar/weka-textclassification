            In 1997 I bought a new Legacy 2.5GT wagon.  

Why I bought the GT wagon:

I lived in South Carolina and needed to move to Los Angeles for college, and needed a vehicle that could haul lots of stuff, looked cool, and didn't get horrid gas mileage.  In South Carolina and southern California, especially in 1997, Subarus were unique cars.  You could be guaranteed that if you drove any Subaru (other than a Outback) that your car would be instantly recognizable, because you'd be the only person in 50 miles with that kind of car.  That appealed to me.  Also, in 1997, if you wanted a manual transmission in a wagon that looked sporty (hoodscoop, etc), Subaru was almost the only game in town.  Trucks, for me, were out of the question because of poor gas mileage and their ubiquitous presence in SC and LA.  The all-wheel drive was a side benefit to me.

My experience with the car:

I had a major accident one year after buying the car.  Ever since then, the car seemed to slightly pull to one side or the other while driving, and vibrated at high speed.  This may not have been the result of the accident.  Later, while driving at night in Texas on a dry road, my roommate managed to spin the car out and into a ditch (he was dodging a dog).  The all-wheel drive was no help in getting out, but at least the car escaped without damage.  Since then, the car has had no real problems at all.  An oil leak and a dead battery, but both were easily fixed.  Now, in 2003, the car has 85,000 miles and runs fine.

Pros:

Roomy enough to carry a disassembled single bed, desk, computer, TV, VCR, bookshelf, and a ton of clothes and books.  Can carry a single mattress inside with back seat down and all doors closed.  That's pretty impressive.  Reliability is another pro.  The car looks cool to me, and wagons are coming back into popularity, now that everyone has realized that the modern "soccer mom" car is no longer a station wagon but a Ford Explorer.  Seriously...all the mommies today drive SUVs, not wagons.  Lastly, the clutch and stick shift are easy to use and visibility in all directions is perfect.  The fact that this is a wagon makes it much easier to see out the back.  

Cons:

Not enough power.  165 horsepower in an all-wheel-drive vehicle is simply not enough.  It works, but isn't exciting to drive.  The all-wheel-drive itself is overrated unless you live in the artic tundra (you know, like upstate New York).  The only effect of all-wheel-drive I've noticed is that the fuel economy is pretty bad for a 4 cylinder -- about 18 mph in the city and 24 on the highway at 85,000 miles -- but it used to be little better when the car was new.  The cupholder is flimsy and small.  The windblocker for the sunroof rattles.  My driver's side electric window tries to keep lowering the window even after it's down all the way.  The clock is positioned exactly where the view of it will be blocked by the driver's hand while driving.  The lumbar support knob broke off.  Lastly, the seats are uncomfortable flat, almost concave.  They lack any real lumbar support (even when the knob worked) at all.  

Recommendation:

Although that may seem like a long list of cons, I would still recommend this car to anyone who wants a practical, reliable, unique-looking (in most of the country) wagon with a manual transmission.  All its cons are minor or easily adjustable (I added a cushion for lumbar support) and no car is perfect anyway.  If, however, you are looking for an automatic wagon and you don't live in the tundra, I would think hard about whether a Honda Accord wagon or something like that might be better for you.  In that situation the only real advantage Subaru has is looks, which are subjective.
