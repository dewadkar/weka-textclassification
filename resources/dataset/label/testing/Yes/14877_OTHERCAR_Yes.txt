            When we purchased the MCV Maciva I was very impressed with it. The first thing that caught my eye was the fact that you could use regular 3.5 disks as film. 
The camera is easy to use once it's out of the box but the special features take awhile to master. The onboard previewer feature allows you to go back and get rid of all those mistakes, making it harder to run out of film. The disks can be easily unloaded to any computer with a 3.5 drive(i hope it would have one). One of the features I thought was really nice was that the camera automatically puts all the picture files into jpeg format for easy transfer over the internet or for use with photo editing programs.
Playing around with the camera's special features like sepia(old/brownish/rustic quality)and negative(color invert) be fun. The zoom is impressive too.
One of the problems I found was with the price tag of almost 700 dollars(cheaper at some places). I suggest waiting if you can and buying one once the &quot;newness&quot; wears off(and the price comes down). Also this camera is harder to use if you don't have a computer, although you can still get the pictures developed at stores it takes away from the camera's feature that you will not have to go develop film.
I recommend this camera to people who want a good, solid digital camera made by a namebrand like Sony.<br><br>
