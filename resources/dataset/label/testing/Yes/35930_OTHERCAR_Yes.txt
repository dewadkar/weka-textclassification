            I have a 1996 Cirrus and it is the best handling car I have ever had. It has left Ford Mustangs and Chevolets in the dust on sharp curves. Climate control is good. Back seat is a little to flat (like a GM car} which leaves you floping around. Good acceleration and brakes. When the 2001s come out guess where i will go. This cars handles like its on rails,and I have yet to see a car in this price range that can even come close to the looks. Best car I have ever owned even with the Jap 6-Cylinder in it.<br><br>
