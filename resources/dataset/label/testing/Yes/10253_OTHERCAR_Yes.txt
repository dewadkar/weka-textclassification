            There's nothing else out there quite like this car. Clean, classy looks -- that won't get "old" in a year or two. Superb handling and steering; lots of money invested in forged aluminum suspension parts, steering gear, and engine. 

Instant, on demand performance -- ample, abundant torque at any speed. Great for passing bursts and driving in hilly areas. The burst passing power is awesome. Rarely needed, but when you do, it's very nice to have.

A Lot of solid engineering evident. For example, the steering let's you sense the texture of the road surface, but with NO vibration or harshness. It's fingertip-light at low speeds (good for my wife, who has arthritis), but nicely firmer at speed, with quick turn-in. Quite a hat trick. 

Handling is just superb. The car is rock solid at high speeds, tracks like it's on rails, and is VERY stable and predictable on fast, sharp turns. Very BALANCED chassis, with close to 50/50 front/rear weight distribution.

Ride is firm but absorbent. Extremely comfortable seats (front AND back) and very quiet cabin. All this in a great handling car, that's also a very nice highway cruiser. 

Excellent sound system. You can enjoy the optional THX stereo system (with steering wheel controls) and converse in normal conversational tones at highway speeds. IMO, the THX is AT LEAST as good as the Lexus Mark Levinson set-up, after listening to both. Caveat: I'm not an audio expert, just an appreciative listener.

Navigation screen is intuitive, with very nice voice command option. And the touch screen works very well. Folds down to access the CD player.

Lot's of features: heated outside mirrors, heated AND cooled front seats with perforated leather (nice quality), HIDs, memory driver seat, power memory telescoping steering wheel, memory adjustable pedals and exterior mirror. Power lumbar in driver AND passenger seat. Driver seat is power up and down, also rare. And you can turn the vehicle stability control off if you wish, or keep it on. Another nice touch.
