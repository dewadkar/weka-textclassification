            When you need a comfortable midsize luxury car at a moderate price, look no further than the Volvo S70.  The reason we leased this vehicle is because it fit the need to hold 3 adults and one growing teenager in comfort without breaking the bank.  
This car is fun to drive, it has good acceleration, its leather seats are never uncomfortable, it has a nice sized backseat for a midsize car, and it has a good trunk size.  The engine-we leased the base model, 168 horsepower, 5 cylinder, torque-199@1,800rpm, although this may not seem like much this car is quick.  Inside the Volvo at 65 mph, this car is as quiet as a BMW 740. Although it is quiet, it doesn't have to be with its AM/FM Cassette stereo, Dolby, 100 watt amplifier, six speakers, and in-dash CD player.  This system can get VERY LOUD without any distortion. 
 The only bad thing about this car is the frequent replacement of parts it requires.  We drove the car about 17,000 miles and the front left signal went out.  We replaced it and it needed to be replaced 3 more times from then until now at 22,000 miles (about $7 per bulb and 10 minutes to install), Volvo could come up with no explanation but did replace it for us the 3rd time.  The front left headlight went out at 20,000 miles, a costly $120+ replacement.  The drivers side rear door lock had to be replaced after it just stopped opening through the power locks (Volvo fixed it under warranty at no cost), and the right side was making noise for about a month (Volvo also fixed under warranty).  The leather on the drivers side rear door was coming off causing two air pockets (Volvo is replacing this under warranty, although they needed to order the piece which is in the process of taking a month) Volvo told me that 4 other owners had reported this problem.  Last on the repairs is that the brake pads needed to be replaced at 22,000 miles @ $50, labor not included (Volvo said replacing the brake pads would void the warranty).
 All in all, the Volvo S70 is a great family sedan, with an amazing sound system, a comfortable ride and a quick engine.<br><br>
