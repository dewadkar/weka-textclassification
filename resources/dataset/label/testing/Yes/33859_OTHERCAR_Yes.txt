            I originally wanted to buy a SUV, but was talked into the Mercury Villager by my husband. After having driven only compact cars, I was a little apprehensive about driving something so big.  I was really surprised at the way this van rides.  It was very easy for me to go from compact to minivan.  The ride is smooth and handles like a car.  I find it easy to pull into tight parking spaces and backing out is not a problem.  
The van is loaded with features such as power windows, power locks, power seat controls, lumbar support, captain seats in rear along with a bench seat, under seat drawer, dual heat and air controls( this is great for kids who are always too hot or too cold!)cup holders all over the van, small storage compartments in the rear. The keyless entry is GREAT!
It also features a six cylinder engine.  I have been driving a four cylinder for five years now, so this makes a big difference for me.  It also holds the road well in the rain or bad weather.
The seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room for everyone.
I have been pleasantly surprised by this van and would get another one in the future.<br><br>
