            528 Sport Wagon - provides the perfect mix of luxury and sport flexibility. If you like to combine business travel on weekdays with driving to cool moutainbike places on weekends - then this is the right car.

I actually think the looks is better than the regular 528 - looks less like a standard accura/accord/lexus - and more like the classic European Sports Wagon

I have extra wide tires and the black line package, both add to good driving feel and control

Engine is quite strong enough - although at times it is needed to rev it a bit to get the right speed...

Be careful with going to close to pavement - since the front fender plastic shields are very low - I have replaced them twice... not very costly but annoying
