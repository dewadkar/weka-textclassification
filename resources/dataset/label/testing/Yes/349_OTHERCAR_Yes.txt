            A Frontier pickup in disguise �Or the latest, greatest genuine mini-SUV? I drove the doors off of one and what follows is my professional opinion�

To be honest, even though the Xterra <i>looks</i> fantastic (especially in profile), it really isn't anything radical or particularly new.  In fact, it is precisely the opposite: something old (yet tried and true) revisited successfully -very successfully, in my opinion.  The Xterra is basically what the original Nissan Pathfinder was, and as such it should be very successful --especially since the Pathfinder has moved upmarket quite a bit.

This review is not really supposed to be a blow-by-blow road test. Rather, it is intended to examine the new Xterra in the eye of the beholder: as a suitable form of personal transportation (this review is similar in style to my Chrysler PT cruiser review, so if you've read that, you know what I mean).

First off, if you are looking for a nice, car-like ride, I strongly recommend you look elsewhere. The Xterra is first and foremost, a truck. There is a simple reason for this: the Xterra is heavily based upon the successful Nissan Frontier pickup. <i>(&quot;Dogs Love Trucks.&quot;)</i>  �It shares its suspension, floorpan, chassis and many major frame and body components with the Frontier, not to mention almost everything mechanical.

However, there are certainly differences, with the most obvious being the fact that the Xterra has no bed, offering instead a generous cargo area. Perhaps the aspect I like the most about the Xterra (aside from it's way-cool roof rack -more on that later) is the raised rear seating position.  Rear passengers enjoy an elevated view of the terrain surrounding them, and the roofline raises noticeably over their heads to provide plenty of rear-seat head room.

I sat in the back, and was nicely surprised to find that I fit just fine (I'm 6').  There is also plenty of room for my large frame in both front seats, but I sure wouldn't want to be the fifth passenger squeezed into the center seat in the rear.  The Xterra simply isn't wide enough to sit three abreast comfortably, unless they happen to be three 5 year-olds.

However, it is really fantastic at something else: swallowing lots and lots of <i>stuff.</i> I was amazed at the amount of cargo space available when the rear seats are folded flat, although the height of the cargo floor is considerable (but not so high as to make loading and unloading a weightlifting workout).  Speaking of the interior, one of the things I like the <i>least</i> about the Xterra is the fact that the entire dash looks to be almost identical to that found in the latest generation Nissan Frontier pickups.

This ultra-plain-Jane (my apologies if your name happens to be Jane) dash really cheapens the vehicle, in my humble opinion.  I mean, it probably wouldn't have cost all that much to whip up at least some new plastic molds and inject the car with a little bit of character on the inside.  Take a look at the great job Nissan did with the dash treatment in all-new Nissan Sentra (my review of it is in the works).  Its interior not only looks and feels much nicer (and is obviously of much higher-quality) than the previous generation Sentra, it completely outclasses the dash in the also-new Xterra by a wide margin in terms of style.

I understand that the dash from the Frontier was lifted pretty much intact, with only the most minor of modifications, in an effort to keep R&amp;D costs to a minimum. This has apparently been accomplished, as the Xterra is certainly inexpensive, starting at about $17,600. However, the dash really spoiled the whole experience for me.  I mean, I've driven Frontier pickup trucks, and now that I've driven the Xterra, I sort of feel like I've just driven yet another Frontier, albeit one that weighs more.

Enough harping over the dash.  It's time to attack the suspension.  Can you say <i>antiquated?</i> Yep, the Xterra is comparable to the Frontier in this area too -in fact, it's pretty much identical: independent front setup, leaf-springs at the rear.  The Frontier feels like the truck that it is, and (not surprisingly) so does the Xterra.  Unlike taking a ride in (for example) a Honda CRV or a Toyota RAV-4, the Xterra feels very firm and completely unrefined -just like the Frontier.  Go figure. :-P

However, this is the whole point of this vehicle, and it brings me back to the subject I touched on earlier: the fact that the Xterra may look radical and new, but the concept is far from it.  Think back -way back. I'm talking about the original Jeep Cherokee and Toyota Land Cruisers here, along with the original Ford Broncos, GMC Blazers and Jimmys. The Xterra is simply the latest offering in the genuinely rugged off-road vehicle segment

This wild beast of a truck is not <i>supposed</i> to be refined or smooth.  It drives like it was designed to: with authority over almost any terrain.  The closest thing to an Xterra is probably a Jeep Cherokee. Not the sleek and refined Jeep Grand Cherokee with its tight unibody construction, but the less-expensive and boxier-looking variant that has been in Jeep showrooms for going on two decades.

Interestingly Jeep is currently working on a facelifted Cherokee, and with this interesting new competitor, they most definitely need it.  However, many people are completely unaware of the Xterras rugged intentions upon arriving at their local Nissan dealer to check one out.

Almost everyone loves the styling, and everyone agrees that the roof-rack is totally cool --so cool in fact, that Nissan now offers what is pretty much the exact same unit as an option on its Frontier pickups. Then you sit it one, and you begin to have your first doubts. Utterings such as those that follow are heard in the passenger cabins of Xterras with regularity, much to the dismay of Nissan dealership sales personnel.: &quot;The Honda seems nicer inside somehow.&quot; The Suzuki felt a lot less like a truck.&quot;

Then you pick a color (perhaps &quot;Hey-Look-At-Me-Officer-Yellow&quot;), let the salesperson make the obligatory photocopy of your driver's license, and off you go on your test drive.  If you have recently driven any of the Frontier's main competitors, such as the Honda CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara, or Toyota RAV-4, the first thought which enters your mind is how unpleasant this thing is to drive.  All of the above feel much more car-like in terms of handling, while the Xterra feels (again) a helluva lot like the Frontier pickup it is based on.

The Jeep Cherokee on the other hand, feels a lot like this thing: rough, heavy and rugged-as it is intended to.  On the other hand, just try to make a Honda CRV do any of the off-road tricks that both the Xterra and the Jeep Cherokee are capable of.  Fjord a small streambed?  �Forget it in the Honda.  The power of a serious V6? Forget that in the Toyota. The agility of a wild animal over rough terrain? Don't even think about it in any of the above, other than (of course) in the Jeep.

The Jeep is really the only serious competitor to the Xterra, unless you count the Ford Explorer V6, a less reliable and much less maneuverable vehicle. Not only do the others lack the ground clearance and suspension travel required to clear serious obstacles, but none of are able to properly handle the most serious of off-roading chores, such as a streambed or a dirt hillside.

The CRV and RAV-4 were designed to be segment-crossover vehicles with the look, height, and some of the capabilities of an SUV, but without the off-road capabilities, overall ruggedness and ability to take serious abuse.  The Xterra, on the other hand really is all of these things; a jack of all trades, if you will.  Like the Cherokee, it is able to take the abuse a serious outdoors-type might want to throw at it.  Camping in the wilds of Oregon? No problem. Visiting a job site? Any time! Picking up the kids from school? Sure!  Cruising the boulevard? Well, why not?  The new Xterra certainly looks cool!

Now for my favorite part: that funky roof rack.  This thing is straight out of a Mad Max movie.  Powder coated and (I think) made of fat aluminum tubes, the various parts are welded or attached together by high-strength plastic and bolts. In the front, there is an integrated storage bin in which (apparently 30 pounds worth of) various smaller items can be stored. This is the essential styling element that completely makes the Xterra stand out.  Not only does it add height, it is also the best looking part of the vehicle, IMHO (although I do like those bulging wheel arches a lot).

The Xterra is available in a multitude of configurations: 4x2, 4x4, with either an inline 4-cylinder engine, or a powerful V6. You have your choice of either a manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic with either engine, and the sporty SE trim level is apparently the hot item at Nissan dealerships.

The 2.4 liter inline four provides 143hp and 154 ft-lbs. of torque, while the somewhat thirstier 3.3L V6 (from the previous-generation Nissan Pathfinder and Infiniti QX4) gives you 170hp and 200 ft-lbs. of torque, or enough to tow 5,000 pounds if you opt for the automatic transmission.  A nice touch <b>(ARE YOU LISTENING DODGE?!?)</b>, ABS (anti-lock) brakes are <b><i>standard equipment</i></b> on each and every Xterra.

Interestingly, overall size is not quite as small as it appears to be.  The Xterra is less than � an inch shorter than a Nissan Pathfinder.  However, the Pathfinder is most definitely in a different league, offering far more in the way of luxury and car-like drivability, albeit for a significantly higher price.

Pricing ranges from $17,599 for a base 4-cylinder 4x2 Xterra all the way up to $24,799 for a V6 4x4 Xterra. Bear in mind that these prices do not include any options, and that you could easily add several thousand bucks to these prices at the dealership.  In fact, by the time you take a V6 4x4 Xterra and add a few goodies to he options list, you are well into Pathfinder territory -which means you could have a 240/250hp V6 and a <i>much</i> smoother ride.

Overall, I would have to recommend the Xterra, as it is a great vehicle for the serious outdoors type.  Its rugged good looks really do accurately hint at its capabilities as a serious SUV.  It is bigger in every way than the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV-4 and Suzuki Grand Vitara, and should prove to be very reliable, if it's brother the Frontier pickup has been any indication.

However, if you have no intention of going off-roading, or at least dealing with really lousy roads (i.e. snow, lots of rain, unpaved surfaces, major hills, etc.), and you have no wish to tow anything heavy, this might not be the best choice for you.  The Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV-4 are both excellent vehicles (albeit smaller, and somewhat more expensive ones), which are far more driver-friendly.

Unlike many of its competitors, the Xterra is no pretender. You could use it for anything you would use a Jeep Cherokee for, and you will look far better while doing it, thanks to the Xterras bold, chunky styling. Speaking of which, it is no accident that the Xterra looks a lot like the Frontier pickup. Everything from the windshield forward is pretty much identical.  Yes, this does mean that you might be mistaken for the driver of a Frontier pickup truck in someone's rearview mirror. Of course, if <i>rugged</i> is your look, then this is not necessarily a bad thing. ;-P

I hope you found this review of the new Nissan Xterra to be both enlightening and informative. If either applies, please rate it highly! Thanx!  ~Matt  :-)<br><br>
