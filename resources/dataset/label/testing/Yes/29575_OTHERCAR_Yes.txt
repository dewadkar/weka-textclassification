            I bought a 2000 Nissan Quest GXE, with the comfort plus package, in June.  I had really wanted a Durango but with two small children I wasn't impressed with the Durango's cargo space.  We stopped at the Nissan dealer specifically to look at used cars when the salesman convinced us to check out a 2000 Quest.  He took us for a test drive and I was sold! While the Quest's on special were solid color, no running boards and no rear controls for the a/c I stood my ground and ended up with a Quest that did have the features I wanted for the sale price! Our salesman and dealership were great.

My Quest is beautiful! It is Deep Metallic Midnight blue with silver trim and running boards, which are great to help my two year old get in and out.  It has grey interior that wipes up easily when spilled on. It has rear heat &amp; a/c controls, tons of cup-holders, an adjustable roof rack, rear headphones jacks(which are great when one wants to watch tv and one wants to listen to a tape/cd or radio!) and it has a tv/vcr unit.  While I would have preferred one of the units mounted on the roof of the car the tv in my unit is bigger.  And it has GREAT get up and go!

I love the dual sliding doors, I previously had a 1995 Town &amp; Country and it did not have this feature.  While I had hoped to find a minivan with a power sliding door the doors on the Quest are so smooth my 6 year old can handle them no problem!  Plus it takes little or no effort to slide them open.  The rear seat in my Quest moves forward to make extra cargo room, very easy and me being a small female with virtually no muscle love this feature! The middle bench and the third row bench all have anchors for my 2 year old's car seat and it is VERY easy to get him in and out, no back pain with this van!  

We recently went to Disneyland in my Quest, myself, my husband my two boys(2 and 6 both car seats) plus my 10 year old brother and my 13 year old cousin.  We went for 5 days so we had luggage for 6 people(and I am a notorious over-packer)plus food/snacks for the trip/hotel for 5 days, then all the luggage plus souvenirs for the ride home and it all fit!  All this and not one single complaint about no room or being crowded by this kids or that kid!  It was amazing.

The quest is easy to maneuver 
and easy to park.  AND it has GREAT Gas Mileage!  I would definitely recommend this as a GREAT Family van!<br><br>
