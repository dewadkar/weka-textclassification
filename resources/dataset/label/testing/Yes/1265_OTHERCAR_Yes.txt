            After being a somewhat avid photographer and believing that my Minolta 7000i was still adequate, I must admit I was wrong.  My son in Alaska sent me this camera as a belated Father's Day gift. Am I pleased, ***** and more so!
First surprise THE WEIGHT! I mean this is a dream with flash enclosed it is less than half the weight of my film camera. Ergonomically ( in other words ease of handling) I love it turn one half and either you will see yourself or the subject. I mean it the first time I went to shoot it was ME ( pretty stupid-yup!).  But far more stupid is my looking through the eye piece viewfinder which is diopter adjustable ( I wear glasses but don't need them with this feature) thinking I have a great shot only to find out I missed it because the lens cap was still on. WHY?  Because after years of through the lens set up I was not used to taking off the lens cap especially when I could  see my subject so clearly. ( Please Nikon do something about the for fools like me.) 

Now for taking pictures the automode is great and quite adequate in resolution though you won't be getting 3 mb+ photos.  As mentioned by another reviewer the serious photographer can play with aperture control,bracketing and many other special effects available.. I find the data that can be placed on a image to be very useful.

I think many others have extolled the value of not having to buy film and the cost of development.  To me the real value is seeing whether you got the shot you wanted, deleting when you wish additional images and knowing you have that PRIZE photo. By the way one of the first thing I did was to out and buy a pack containing four rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batteries with a charger.  For less than $18.00 I have shot over 500 images and viewed them with only having to recharge four times.  I also picked up a power caable so that I can download at my computer  without having to use my battery power.  I have had some of my images printed by an on-line service and they did an excellent job with 8x10s of less that 2mb photos. 

I could keep on but I think I should indicate that color saturation, zoom capability, best shot selection and white balance all exceeded my expectations. All in all a great gift.  Old Joe  For photos see Old Joe's Hamesteaad page at msn.com
