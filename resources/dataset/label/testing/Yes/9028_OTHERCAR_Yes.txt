            I just bought a brand new kia Sportage about a month ago and I am loving it.  Not only is it $5,000 - $10,000 cheaper than other SUVs, it is roomier than some of the mid-sized ones, my 6'3 husband fits easily behind the wheel with lots of head room left over, something he couldn't do in the Rodeo.  I would recommend this SUV to anybody, it is narrower than our Toyota Corolla which makes parking and switching lanes in traffic a breeze, and it has the best warranty offered in the country.  It has a smooth ride, but still a more rugged feel than those SUV's that are built like cars.  And it's base model comes loaded with features, power locks and windows and a built in security system for starters.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs more room than a 4 door car, but doesn't want the hassle of driving a larger vehicle in traffic.<br><br>
