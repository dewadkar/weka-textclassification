            I have been driving 2WD Toyota pickups for about 10 years.  They are the most dependable reliable trucks I have ever seen.  All my friends drove Fords and Nissan and others.  They went through about 5 trucks and I only had 2.  They always make it to and past 200000 miles.  IF you get a chance to pick one up get it.  It is going to be the best little truck you ever own.  You can get the 90's models for under $10000 and they are great.  If you get one under 100000 miles it is just getting broke in, you'll have another 100000 left in it.<br><br>
