            I purchased my 1995 Hyundai in September 1995.  In four years of ownership, I have not experienced any major problems.  There was a small repair to the windshield wiper, which stopped working because a bolt became loose.  The bolt was tightened while I waited (approximately five minutes) and I drove off.  

There was also a recall, but I don't remember why.  The car did not experience any chronic repair problems.  The base price of the Hyundai Accent places it near the bottom of all new vehicles.  However, I do not find that the car itself deserved the reputation as a &quot;cheap&quot; car.  The car handles well, and accelerates surprisingly quickly.  However, the four cylinder engine and thin walls cause a great deal of noise when driving on the highway.  

The interior is no-frills, but the seats are comfortable.  At five feet, ten inches, I never felt uncomfortable anywhere in the car.  However, a person over six feet tall might feel a little cramped.  Hyundai has started offering a 100,000 mile, five year, bumper-to-bumper warranty, which shows that they stand behind their vehicles.  Having already exceeded the warranty on my 1995, it would be nice security.  However, the need for an extended warranty has not yet presented itself. 

The styling of the Hyundai Accent is sharp and shows that they are committed to offering an attractive car at a reasonable price.  The body style was sharpened a little for the 2000 model year, and improves on an already attractive look.  The metal could be a little thicker, but that seems to be the industry standard.  A hail storm caused major denting to this vehicle, resulting in the car being &quot;totaled&quot; by the insurance company.  I bought the vehicle back from the insurance company (cheap) and sold it to my brother.

I occasionally used this vehicle to transport my two children.  One is still in a car seat.  Because my car only has two doors, this requires placing the baby in the car seat, with the front seat slid forward.  Although it is a little awkward, it is not prohibitively difficult.  The car seat goes in just as easily, and fits snugly in the back, allowing the driver to still manage plenty of leg room.

The gas mileage on this vehicle is excellent, averaging around 30 miles per gallon.  The manual transmission is peppy and accelerates adequately.  The steering is smooth and allows for easy movement.  On the highway, high winds will create slight motion or drifting.  The light weight of the car make it vulnerable to high gusts of wind.  However, it is not common to drive in that type of weather, and the car is still able to manage in spite of the increased motion caused by the wind.

Overall, I was highly pleased by this vehicle, and would recommend it to anyone with economic considerations, who desire a new vehicle.  It is a great commuter car, or first car for your sixteen year old (who will probably hate you for buying it, because it is not a Camaro)!
