            Since I commute to work over 50 miles round trip, I need a dependable, affordable, yet comfortable vehicle. I custom ordered a Ranger supercab 4x4, with four door option. This truck provides plenty of room, for me to &quot;live in&quot; while working. The four door option provides easy access to the back, which is especially convenient when loading groceries or getting the rear passenger in.  This vehicle with the small six cylinder engine, gives excellent gas mileage, a special concern since gas prices are at its worst. This truck is a pure joy to drive, and with the 4x4, will take you practically anywhere you wish to go. It has had a few recalls, none of which were major, and the time to have it repaired was very minimal. I must admit though my first choice for a new vehicle, while trading in my 1997 F-150, was a F150 supercab, but the price was a little above what I wanted to pay. I am glad now that I chose to order this truck, as it has lived up to my expectations, even my father gets a kick out of driving it on occasion. <br><br>
