            My recent purchase of the Mavica MVC-FD73, was my first digital purchase. 
I am more than pleased with it. It goes beyond my expectations. It is extremely user friendly with the convenience of the 3 1/2&quot; floppy transfer 
of pics to the computer is well worth the purchase. Price was resonable.
I have taken on photography as a hobby and have 35mm equipment out my ears. This will be an added plus to my already collection. It will allow me to shoot and look at the finished product immediately before shooting it to film. I find it easy to operate with its many added features a plus. Battery life is excellent with its recharging ability an added plus. Though purchased for personal use, I have been using it for work related subjects. I am a training officer in the fire service. Using the camera along with Power Point, it makes presentations easy. I recommend it to everyone.<br><br>
