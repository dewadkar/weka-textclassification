            WE (myself and my wife) went to the ford store to purchase an expedition.  We took one look at this and purchased it on the spot.  We absolutely love it. plenty of power and all the lights bells and whistles.  We get lots of onlookers and many questions about the vehicle.  I am proud to park it in front of my office for all my patients to see.  Lots of room inside in both the front and back, I am a VERY VERY large man and have absolutely no problem getting in or out.  Lots of fun to drive.  Any one interested in a new SUV should undoubtedly test drive the Sport Trac.Controls are easy to understand and easy to reach. The 4x4 is controlled by a turn of a switch on the dashboard. Very basic instrument panel with all the needed info. displayed well. Seats are very comfortable with the drivers seat being electric,( but not the passengers).Plenty of storage space under the console (between seats) with the entire storage area being able to zip closed and carried out of vehicle like a bag. The rear window is controlled by a knob on the dashboard which can be pushed for venting or turned to roll down the window.  There is an optional locking top for the rear bed which is very handy and water tight ( so far), very easy to lock, unlock and remove. There is also a cargo extender available for the bed to go over the tailgate for more bed space. Overall lots of lights, bells and whistles.<br><br>
