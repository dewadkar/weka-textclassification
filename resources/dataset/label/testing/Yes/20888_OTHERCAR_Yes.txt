            I purchased a Chrysler PT Cruiser on February 7th, the first day a dealer could submit an order. I placed my order over the phone using a credit card to put down my deposit. Why would someone make a $21,000 purchase sight unseen? My answer is that finally an American manufacturer has offered a truly unique vehicle design. After seeing the concept cars on which the PT Cruiser is based, I did my best to follow its development into a production vehicle. In my opinion, the result is even better than the original concept. The style evokes a sense of history in that the PTC is prompts visions of hot rods, gangsters and American Graffiti. Yet, beneath its fantasy sheet metal, the PTC incorporates everything Chrysler has learned about how to make a minivan maxi-convenient. What's more, the PTC is proving to be more than just a pretty face. The car enthusiast magazines are giving it solid marks for handling too. Given the enthusiasm and the initial sales of the PTC, it appears that Chrysler has a product that will create an American market for small, &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; vehicles. The PTC may even shake the ongoing love affair with sport utility vehicles. Yes, in my opinion, the PT Cruiser can do nothing but good for the American car industry. For once, Detroit can take its inspiration from a uniquely American concept rather than European snobbery. It will be another month before I'm cruising in my Cruiser, but I'm confident I have purchased a breakthrough vehicle with more style and functionality than anything else on the road.<br><br>
