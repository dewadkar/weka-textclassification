            Here in Norway, it must be said that this is a very rare car, and with a base price of over 60000 dollars, that probably isn't hard to understand (cars are taxed by engine size, output and weight here, resulting in a C5 Corvette costing more than 130000 dollars in the shop). Still, I managed to convince a gentleman at my Honda dealership to let me take one for spin, he was obviously hoping that I'd actually buy it (like a 19-year old does every day, right ?).
Well, about the car... Styling is mostly a matter of taste, so I'll let you decide for yourself whether or not you like the conservative Japanese styling job. The shark-like xenon headlights are a rare spot of creativity, and although they annoy other drivers, you simply can not live without them, once you get used to having them in the dark.
Also, the big, chromed, twin tailpipes, and clear rear lenses make it a bit cheeky. Inside I was met with a lot of black. Black leather seats, black dashboard, black speedometer.. It's Japanese, you know..
To start up you need to do more than turn the key. A sexy detail is the red starter button next to the steering wheel. It is quite a job, with first all of the digital instrumentation lighting up (as if taken straight from Knight Rider), followed by a noise reminiscent of your grandmothers Honda Civic. On steroids. The car is surprisingly easy to drive ( compared to an older Ferrari or Porsche).
Most of the switches are simple, in typical Japanese style, except that just about everything is concentrated around you, the driver. All buttons are in reach from the steering wheel, and nothing on the center console, mediocre stereo apart. Everythig is screwed together almost to German standards, however the materials don't feel quite like a BMW.
The electric roof on the one I tried was phenomenally quick, and easy to use. However, with the roof up, you have no space in the &quot;boot&quot;. This car will not carry a suitcase, even less a golf-bag. This is a weak point, because it does take away some of the practicality of the car.
For those of you who don't know, this car is equipped with Honda's VTEC engine technology, which means that it has two sets of something-or-other (I study economics, not engineering), and it switches them at about 5700 rpm. Up to that point, known by the experienced as the &quot;VTEC-point&quot; the engine changes character both in power and sound. If you are the sort of person who cannot stand the sound of an engine working hard, then stay away. Max torque is dreadfully low, meaning that you should stay between 5000 rpm and the magical redline set at 9000 rpm (at which point you should be enjoying yourself and be exhibiting a rather large smile). If you have the oppurtunity, go to your Honda dealer and demand that he allows you to hear this sound. It is more an ode to fine engineering than the deep, but equally beautiful warble of a V8.
The car is so stiff, it feels like it's kicking you should you hit a sleeping policeman. It also means that you get a feel of what's going on beneath you, because Honda have made a mistake. The power steering is too light, making the communication between driver, car and road very poor. Believe me, this car will throw out its rear end, and you had better be ready to catch it. But this is exactly what is fun.. putting a car sideways, negotiating bends and roundabouts at unlikely (and silly) angles is what I call &quot;smile-on-your-face-motoring&quot;. This is so hard to do in an AWD car like the Audi TT, but a prod of the Hondas throttle, and you will be smiling (or crying, if you are a poor driver). The Honda is easy to drive normally, but the lack of communication makes it harder to throw about. I suggest you take the car for a day before you buy it, and see if you have the taste for its eccentricities, and see if you have the skills to enjoy it.<br><br>
