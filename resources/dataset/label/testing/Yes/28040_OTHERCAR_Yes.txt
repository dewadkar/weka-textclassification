            My Neon 2000 is my second Neon. I bought my first Neon in 1998. The Neon is fuel efficient, comfortable to ride in, and roomy. I love the way they handle. My only criticism of my 98 was it didn't have much pickup, but it's other features made it worth the money. I recently traded the 98 in for a 2000. The 2000 really improved on the original Neon. It is much peppier and roomer but still has the ease of handling and fuel efficiency. The base model is pretty inexpensive, but this time I got all the bells and whistles so it cost a lot more. It is, however, still a bargain compared to other cars its size. I have driven it in the mountains, on several long trips, and I can't say there is a thing I dislike. The Neon has a lot of good safety features built into it too. I love this car and intend to buy another one when my daughter starts driving next year.<br><br>
