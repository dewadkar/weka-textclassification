            The model I own is the LXi with leather interior.  I bought it used with low-mileage.  Here is the detailed review covering all aspects of performance...

LOOK: (A) 

This is a very nice car to look at as you can tell from the pictures. It speaks "luxury" all the way around. With the classic chrome grille and beautiful leather interior. The control pannel is plated with foxwood and the dash is also attractive.  I'm not crazy about the look from the back but it's not bad at all.

COMFORT and FEEL: (A) 

The seats are extremely comfortable and and the driver seat is electronically fully adjustable. There is ample room for even very tall passengers (I'm 6'5"). The wheel feels so good you'll enjoy holding it and the same goes for the gear stick.  One thing I don't like is that the steering wheel doesn't have a hole cut out at the 6 o'clock position.  I like to just rest my hand there on long highway trips but you have to do it from the side with this car.

DRIVING: (A) 

Very good. It'll speed up to pass in no time and the handles are very smooth. It's a silent ride with very little turbulence even at high speeds. 


RELIABILITY: (B-) 

The general driveability of the car was never in doubt although there have been a few minor annoyances that have emerged with use. I bought this car used and right now it has about 60,000km on it. A problem common in Chryslers is a clicking noise in the transmission's computer when shifting down to stop. I hate that but it's too expensive to fix right now. That is the worst problem I've had. Another small issue was an oil leakage problem but it's been taken care of rather easily. 


CONVIENIENCE & FEATURES: (A-) 

There are no computer monitors or DVD players but there are a few nice features to this car. 

The seats fold down to make for more trunk space (in an already huge trunk). 

There are coin slots and a pen holder in the armrest compartment. There is also plenty of space for item storage there. 

The glove box is fairly large. 

There are magazine/newspaper compartments on the back of the seats which are very subtle yet spacious. 

Remote entrance and lock is standard (I think) and that is a feature that I love. 

Steering wheel adjusts to fit any size. 


SOUND SYSTEM - (B+) 

Most cars don't come with the greatest stereo's, however this one comes with a very good one. You will need to add an amp for more power but you can really pump it up to a loud volume already. Mine only has the cassette player and radio but a CD player is availiable as well. Generally it gives some of the best sounds of any generic stereo system out there.  Also has great radio reception AM and FM.
