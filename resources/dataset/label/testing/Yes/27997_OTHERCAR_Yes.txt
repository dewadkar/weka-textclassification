            THis vehicle is astounding, it handles so amazingly, It has an awesome engine, No reliability problems (never been in the shop), Unlike the terrible Lexus I owned. Pure luxury, the extremely comfortable seats. The sporty character that comes with this car. The Gauges are red I love it. The navigation system is so cool tells you points of interest, when your tires go bald or will alert you if you have a flat tire. This car is so refined, My father has a bad lower back and the seats just awesome. This car just has nothing negative about it. Audi makes an awesome high roller luxury that easily beats that crappy Jap. lexus. Everything in this car flows so warmly in the inter and the exterior.<br><br>
