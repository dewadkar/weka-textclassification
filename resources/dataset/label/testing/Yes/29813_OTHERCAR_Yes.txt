            As usual, before buying a product, I did lots of research on digital cameras before buying my Kodak DC260. My decision was based partly on my owning an earlier model Kodak digital camera. I was impressed with many of the advanced features of this camera, primarily with the scripting available. Many scripts have been previously written for this camera and are available for free download over the internet. The camera is easy to operate and fairly intuitive. Picture quality is very good and I have printed out some 8&quot;X10&quot; photos with amazing results. This is, of course, highly dependent on the quality of the printer used. I upgraded from an Epson to an HP after purchasing this camera, due to the HP providing a fresh print head with each print cartridge replacement. I would never consider purchasing a camera again without a USB interface, what a difference from the previous serial interface! After taking 600+ photos with this camera in the past 9 months, I am well pleased with the results!<br><br>
