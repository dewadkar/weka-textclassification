            I bought this product because I wanted to communicate with my family and friends overseas.. I did not want to spend a fortune on Digital camera.. but I also wanted video conferencing.. At my local retailer I was pointed towards the Kodak EZ200.. I looked at the reviews and what others had to say about similar products, and therefore decided to purchase the Kodak EZ200... I installed it, and within 5 minutes I was taking pictures, making video calls etc.. The images are quite good, for an average priced camera, and overall I am quite happy with the purchase.. What I wish the product had, is a viewing screen to see your shots when away from the PC (not connected) .. you need to come back to the PC to see what the shots look like.. 
Fantastic for kids, those who want to communicate over the net, and are not fussed about professional photos..(although the quality of the pics amazed me..)
