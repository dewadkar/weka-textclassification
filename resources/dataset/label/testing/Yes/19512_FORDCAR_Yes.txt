                   I now had my V6 mustang for a couple of years and I have put on 54k miles on it. So far, it's been a great car and pretty reliable. When I bought it I did have some things that bothered me off the bat that was mostly cosmetic. So I will hit the bad first then the good.
      My first issue was the shifter knob, that plastic thing does not belong on the shifter. It kept on coming off or twisting. I replaced that with the billet knob which made a world of difference. The next issue was with the height of the car, the car had a big gap between the fender well and the tires. I was almost able to put a football on the tire. I lowered the car a couple of inches and added the GT rims with tires, WOW what a difference. My 3rd issue was with the amount of power the V6 engine made. It really needs 225hp and 250ft-lbs of torque to be just right. That made me 2nd guess my choice and I did consider trading up to the GT model. When you compare the horse power to family coupes like the Nissan Maxima and the Toyota Camery, and sport compacts like the Dodge Neon RT4 and Ford SVT Focus, the 193 horse power is just not cutting it anymore for a base model mustang. The last two issues are also performance related. My last negative opinions&#133an open differential and a single exhaust should not be on any mustang. That&#146s all the bad.
     Now for the good stuff&#133 I love the looks of the 99+ mustangs. I was not too fond of the 94-98 body style. The 94-98 Mustang&#146s was a little too rounded and curved for me. I like the angles that the 99 and up mustang&#146s have. I also like how solid and heavy the car feels. The car definitely does not feel fragile at all. I am pretty hard on cars, and this one has taken all my bad habits without complaining.
      This car does just about everything I want it do to. This is the only car that I owned, that I felt comfortable enough to just take off and drive long distances without worrying about it breaking down. I have taken the car on many trips from Sacramento to San Francisco down the Pacific Coast Highway all the way to LA and then over to Las Vegas and it had not given me a single problem. It is perfect for tearing up the highway and running thru roads with lots of turns. I have also made many trips to Tahoe and Reno from Sacramento, and the car just loves to cruise, and does not complain when climbing the mountains at slightly excessive speeds. Want to do 2200rpms @ 75mph up a mountain in 5th gear? no problem!  Want to take it to a ï¿½ miles track? No Problem. Want to take it to an open SCCA track event?  Again No Problem! The mustang is a rugged car. 
        The handling and braking is pretty decent. I did have to slam on the brakes a couple of times and the car was very controllable. I also had to avoid a deer once, and doing a fast lane change was un-dramatic and very deliberate. I really think that if I was in any other car like my mom&#146s Lumina, that I would have hit the deer. The gas mileage is pretty good considering that amount of time that I am &#147on the gas&#148 instead of partway. I have been averaging 250 miles to the tank in the city and I hit 330 miles on the highway. The most I ever got was 347 miles on one tank. I always fill up fuel light to fuel light. My worse was 200 miles. 
      There is a lot of support for the Mustangs from Ford, and the aftermarket. If you want to customize a car to your individual tastes, you can&#146t get a better car to do it on than a mustang regardless of what model it is. Getting parts is not an issue like a lot of other cars on the road today. Also the parts are very reasonably priced, and can be had from just about anywhere. On top of that, there is not a single thing on a mustang that you can&#146t get aftermarket replacements for. The aftermarket has driven the price down on a lot of items for the mustang. Also the popularity of the mustang also helps keep the cost down.  
        Mustangs are pretty much a legend and have earned its right as one of America&#146s symbols. I have been to a lot of different countries and spoke with many car enthusiasts. When it comes to what cars represent America, the top two spoken names are Corvette and Mustang. I have not been to a single country in Europe that people didn&#146t know what a Mustang was or a Corvette. That&#146s something unique and that does not happen too often. Thank ranks up there with the world super cars like Ferrari and Porche and other exotics. There are many clubs and many web sites that cater to the mustangs. So there is plenty of support just in case you need help.
    Now there are a few draw backs to getting a V6 mustang. The biggest is the lack of power. If you are into power and you want a lot of power, or you think that maybe latter on you like to have a powerful car, get a GT or Cobra or another variant of the mustang that has the V8.  But if you just like the looks, and can not afford the payments and you need the cheaper insurance, get the V6. You can always modify the V6 mustangs with aftermarket parts to make it faster, stronger and better. I bought the V6 because I needed a lower car payment and cheaper insurance. Now I can afford a GT, but considering that I don&#146t have much to go till my mustang is paid off, I&#146ll wait for the next generation Mustang and then get a GT and keep this one as my daily driver.  If I had to do it all over again, I would, I don&#146t really kick myself too much for getting a V6 Mustang. At the time, it was the best I could afford, without putting myself into a financial bind. And it has done everything I needed it to do.
