            After several years of careful research, I decided that the Toyota Camry was the car for me. I love the car's design and the surplus of space that this car has. My Camry is a '92 and I still have it now. I have had some problems with the car, though. My main problem has been with the car's windows. Three of them have broken. My windows are electric so I would definitely recommend the manual ones instead. Another big problem has been the power steering. I have had to replace the power steering belt and pump. But overall I like my Camry. It's a good family car, and relatively dependable.<br><br>
