            If you're looking for a mid-size, mid-priced sedan or coupe, the 2000 Oldsmobile Alero may be the car for you.  

POWERTRAIN:
The 3.4 ltr V6 provides excellent acceleration. I found it to be right on par with its GM platform sharing brother, the Pontiac Grand Am, despite the use of the Ram Air system used on the Pontiac.  The car's overall low weight makes it a little quicker off the line then the more expensive Chevrolet Monte Carlo 3800.  The 4-speed auto shifts very smoothly in both directions.

HANDLING:
This is where the Alero really leaves the old Achieva out to pasture.  With 16&quot; Aluminum wheels and performance Goodyear tires attached to the end of the rack and pinion steering makes for an excellent cornering car, perfect for changing lanes, swerving around obstacles, or just enjoying a Sunday drive.  If you are looking into a smooth cruiser, you may want to opt for the higher profile tires and softer suspension found on the Buick Century.

STYLING:
Picking up its styling cues from the hugely successful Aurora, the Alero is definitely a sharp looking automobile.  The Alero is essentially a different style of Grand Am.  The Alero provides a twist of sophistication to the Pontiac base.  The smoother lines and less cluttered exterior separate these two GM products.  

INTERIOR:
Big analog gauges and ergonomic controls make this car very easy to drive.  The adjustable front buckets are very comfortable, however, the rear seat in my coupe is a little short on leg room for taller passengers.  I'm about 6', 200lbs and can fit in the back without too much trouble.  But I wouldn't want to ride their for more than an hour.  The 60/40 folding rear seat reveals a very roomy trunk.
The most obvious problem with the interior of the Alero is the poor placement of the two front cup holders. One holder is interfered with by the HVAC controls, while it is uncomfortable to move the gear shifter when anything taller then a tin can is in the back holder (note: rear cup holders are more suitable).  Also, the Alero does not come with a built in ashtray.  The available add on uses up the front cup holder (not affected by HVAC controls).
