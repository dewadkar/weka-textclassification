            I was looking for a camera to use to take reasonable quality shots under a
variety of circumstances. Since I seldom remember to get film developed, digital seemed to be the answer. For the price range I was looking at,
the Olympus D-340 R seemed to be the best in terms of features and resolution. Nearly a year of use has borne out that it was a good choice.

The big things I hit my head on during that time were the lack of optical zoom, and the poor to non-existant picture quality in outdoor shots as light fades. Neither of these was a surprise; For a digital camera in this price range I didn't expect either of these.

The camera typically goes with me anywhere I might go during daylight hours, and has seen a good deal of use over that time. I wasn't disappointed until the on-off switch under the lens door got a broken tip
and stopped turning the camera on and off when the door was opened and shut. In the process of popping the door off to operate the switch,
I cracked the door. I returned the camera under warranty, expecting to have to cover the door, but not the switch. Instead, they claimed it was
impact damage and covered none of it. This was the only major disappointment of the 11 months I've owned the camera, but at 1/3 the original cost of the camera for the repair, it was a big one.

In summary, if you're looking for a filmless camera so you can take good quality pictures in situations where background lighting or flash will be adequate, don't need or can live without optical zoom, and don't intend to use the warranty, this may be the camera for you.
