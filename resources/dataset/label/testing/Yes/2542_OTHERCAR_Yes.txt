            My husband and I were expecting our first baby together. He has two children from a previous marriage. At that time we had an Oldsmobile Alero. It is fine with the family we had then, the kids could get in and out ok, enough room for us. The new baby was going to be another  situation. When we looked into bigger vehicles, we looked at Tahoes, Suburbans, and Jeeps. We did not even think of Mini-vans, I personally did not like the look of the &quot;Van&quot;. I am fairly young, 24, and did not want to &quot;look&quot; like a mommy. 
Our salesman told us to take the van for 2 weeks, use it and see what we thought. Well, we did not give it back. It was not only sporty looking, but had a lot of pick-up-and-go to it. When I put my foot on the peddle, that baby went! 
Additional features I love are the double back doors, very handy when we have all the children, the two older ones want out NOW! So they can get out one door while I take my time getting the baby out of the other door. I also like the remote entry. I push a button on the key-chain remote and the back passenger side door slides open, VERY convenient. 
I do not have a bad thing to say about this vehicle. Not only is it good for family life, but when we head out for a fun night with our buddy's we have plenty of room for them, I suggest the bucket seats in the back, not the bench, easier access to the very back. Also you can remove the seats in the back for loading furniture or whatever big items you need to haul. if you just need a little room you can flip the very back seat up for more room, still having two seats in the back available.
This vehicle is great for the old, the young, whomever! I am so glad my salesman offered to let me take this for a few weeks, I never would have thought I would fall in love with a &quot;mini-van&quot;!<br><br>
