            This review is based on my research and test driving of a new 2001 Toyota Echo.  I wound up not buying the car, but I thought the car was great.  Here's why:

INTERIOR
This car has a very refreshing appearance.  It has a high roofline, so there is plenty of headroom.  So much in fact, that rear seat passengers can see over the front seat headrests out the front windows and through the side windows with almost no obstructions.
The seats themselves are nicely upholstered with cloth that even has a bit of color worked into the weave.  A nice departure from the older more bland interiors in this car class.  The front seats were very comfortable, but they have very limited adjustments, forward/backward, and seat back forward/backward.  The seating position is high though due to the high roofline, and I didn't really miss any other adjustments.  The dashboard is a bit on the "futuristic" side, with round grated vents, bulging radio console, and the general flow of the dash.  The ventilation controls were all what I've come to expect from a Japanese car, very user friendly and easy to manipulate.
This car has a unique instrument cluster.  It is positioned in the center of the dash, slightly tilted toward the driver.  I have heard a lot about this, that it was done for safety reasons, that it was done for the ability to make it a right-hand driver without major dash adjustments, etc.  I didn't mind it where it was, and as a matter of fact it was very convenient to drop my eyes to see the speedometer after looking in the rear view mirror.  The problem I had with it was it's limited guages.  Speedometer and fuel guage was it.  It didn't even have a tach or temperature guage, two staples in the limited 4 guage Japanese configuration.  I think that is a big minus, especially the temperature guage.  Based on the car's surprising performance, a tach is worthwhile too.  The car had power door locks and the switch is on the console between the seats.  Keyless entry is an option, but power windows are not.  The car has a big back seat, comfortable enough for two adults, and there are five shoulder belts in the car (all seats).  General impression inside the car is comfortable, good visibility out, and secure.
The trunk is enormous, and the rear seats fold down as well.

Exterior
This is where a lot of people's opinions vary.  I personally find the boxy highboy style to be a nice variation on the square shape most under $15,000 cars have.  It does create a high center of gravity however that concerns some people.  The paint and fit and finish quality seem to be what you come to expect from Toyota.  I drove the four door model, and all the doors were easy to get in and out of, and I think the four door is more flattering because it breaks up the rear quarter panel a little bit.  It is a small, high, narrow car, and it only weighs about 2,000 pounds.  It doesn't give that impression from inside while driving though.

Performance
The car has Toyota's new 1.5L VVT-i engine.  The VVT-i stands for variable valve timing with intelligence.  This means that the valves can work differently under stress or conservative driving, thus not using speed quantities of fuel when cruising leisurely, yet making torque available on demand.  The car is rated at 108hp and 105 ft lbs. of torque.  It felt very peppy.  Without a tach it was hard to tell just how fast the rpm's got up, but the car has been rated 0-60 at 8.5 seconds.  Very respectable for a car that is marketed for efficiency.  The shifter was smooth and easy to use.  The clutch was light, but on this size car, you don't expect a heavy transmission.  The light clutch also doesn't wear out your left leg when driving in traffic.  The car is zippy from the first pressure on the gas pedal all the way through the upshift.  A lot of people have commented on the narrow tires the car comes with.  I find this interesting.  For 5.5 years I drove a 1992 Honda Civic si.  It had 185/60/14 sized tires.  The ECHO has 175/65/14, essentially the same size tires as a 1992-1995 Honda Civic.  They did not bother me, nor did I feel uncomfortable at all swerving the car back and forth at 60+mph.  I also didn't feel any discomfort taking corners in this car.  The brakes felt smooth and solid, stopping the car effectively without any pull or grind.  This car was equipped with optional ABS.

Options
Most everything on this car is an option.  They offer two "packages" that include a combination of this equipment.  Options include: Power steering, a/c, ABS, power door locks, keyless entry, intermittent wipers, side impact airbags for front seat passengers, upgraded stereo system, and rear window defroster to name the major ones.  The problem with the options is that the car is advertised for $10,000, but that doesn't include power steering even.  Who drives a new car today without?  The car realistically bare equiped is $13,000 or so with a manual transmission.  Add the ABS, a/c, and a couple others, and the car I looked at was $15,200!  That was a bit surprising to me.
