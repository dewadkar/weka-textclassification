            My wife and I have five children and our prior Dodge Grand Caravan just didn't fit us comfortably. Although with todays gas prices, it can get costly to operate and this is definitely not a commuting vehicle unless you have someone else paying your gas bill, it is the best way to get your family around in comfort and safety. 
The engine performance is outstanding, the safety is unsurpassed with the single exception of no child safety locks on the rear doors and the comfort is beyond all expectations. The dealer said you need to be prepared for a truck-like ride but even this proved to be somewhat off the mark. 
This is the best vehicle we have yet to own when it comes to large family transport in comfort, style and safety. If you can afford the lease payment, which to be honest was just slightly more than a minivan, it's well worth it. If you are more of a buy it person, this vehicle is truly and investment that is well made. Expect this vehicle to give you at least ten plus years of top notch performance. I bet it would be hard for you to find a vehicle that does much better at value retention over time than the Suburban.  <br><br>
