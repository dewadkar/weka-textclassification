            Currently I own a '99 M3, but previously owned a '95 M3.  It goes without saying that the M3 is an awesome car in terms of handling and power.  Although almost identical (95 &amp; 99), there are several small differences between the two.  For one, BMW did a much better job at finishing the interior of the 99 vs the 95.  The car is much tighter and even the steering wheel has a much more polished look.  In fact the steering wheel of the 95 did not even have the BMW polished logo in the middle.  On the exterior, all 99's have the five spoke &quot;hammer&quot; rims.  A much more aggressive and powerful looking rim than the 95's 10 spoke five star.  Also, BMW went back to the staggered rim sizes (7.5&quot; 225/45/17 front 8.5&quot; 245/40/17 rear).  While this is suppose to enhance corning performance, it will be slightly more expensive due to the inability to rotate tires.  To polish off the refinements, my 99 engine sounds much cleaner and smoother than the 95.  It does not lack the Vrooohm, or noted deep pitched throttle body that BMW is known for, it just rev's smoother.  You must take this with a grain of salt though considering the 99's engine is hardly broken in.  Although the 99 seems to better all around in terms of refinement, there is one area that it falls behind in.  The suspension on the 99 is softer...get that.  I noticed such a difference in the 99's suspension, that I went out and purchased a front shock tower brace.  I have contemplated adding a rear tower brace and or lower control arms, but I am highly opposed to modifications to an already great car.  Overall, I enjoy my 99 more than the 95 (after the shock tower brace), and many times wish I had more time to enjoy it.  If you are looking for a car that really performs, can turn heads (both looks and sound), and will be strong enough to last many miles, than the M3 is for you.  You just have to get over the price...but that is all relevant.
