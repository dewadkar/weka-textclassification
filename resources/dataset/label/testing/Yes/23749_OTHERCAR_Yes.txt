<TEXT>
            People often mistake my Jetta for a pricier high-line brand with the same body style.  I love it because it handles well, it is very comfortable and it offers great amenities such as a super stereo system with ultra clear Bose speakers, heated seats (my model), controls at your finger tips which are easy to read.  This is one car that you don't have to read the manual on to know what is what!

This car is appropriate for all types of people from the yuppy to surfer.  It offers style to compliment all types of people, plus for all of the features it offers as standard, it is reasonably priced.  

People will turn their heads when you drive by!<br><br>
