            I bought a 1996 Ford Explorer XLT after testing a Blazer as well.  I found the Blazer was short on head room, and handled less reliably.  My Explorer, dark blue with a light blue pin stripe is a perfect fit in my 36 year old garage, and the only negatives are the gas consumption (about 13 miles to the gallon) and in winter, the gear sticks in 4-wheel low when it is below freezing for a week.  That makes for a problem driving around town at 30 mph!  Minor, minor irritations are that the push-button radio dial won't turn off and the driver side bottom seat trim is loose and I can't glue it or tape it down.

I can carry what I want, sit above all traffic - which to me is worth it all by itself, and when we had a 20&quot; snowstorm last winter, I could still go for milk if I had to!  The rounded front end of the truck is just beautiful.  

I don't know if I will own an SUV forever, because my kids will eventually get bigger and go away, but for now, this beats a station wagon all to heck!  I looked at wagons, which I grew up with, but they are just so ugly!  It's a great luxury, but well worth it to carry the sleds, Christmas trees, groceries, and other cargo of a busy mom.  <br><br>
