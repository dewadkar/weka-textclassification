            A few months ago I got one of these cars the handling
 was good the price (about 14K )affordable and the gas mileage was much better than any thing else id driven before(witch isn't really saying anything). 

 I bought the car in July and now only six months after ward a few problems have arisen the trunk doesn't open except from the interior button the driver side window is some what messed up. However the tire wear is low and there have been no engine problems at all. While the get up and go of it is great the turning excellent and the brakes stop on a dime and give you change variety I (heh I haven't needed to test the safety features yet) all that is slim comfort when waiting 3 weeks for the dealership to repair any problems covered by the warranty .

All and all this is a good car for those with not a lot of money or for teenagers needing a first car.  <br><br>
