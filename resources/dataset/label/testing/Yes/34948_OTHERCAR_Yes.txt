                I have been wanting to drive the Grand Prixs ever since they came out, new in 97, and especially have had my eye on the GTP, as it's top of the line, and I LOVE top of the line. So when I had the opportunity to slide inside one, I took it. 
   

  I must applaud the dealership, I had a great experience. The salesman I had was very nice and professional and after, ahem, hinting that a GTP would REALLY brighten my day, he brought around a GORGEOUS black sedan and went back inside, leaving me to experience it myself, which was totally fine with me.
  

  The car runs smooth, and quiet. The black leather buckets were oh-so-comfy and boosted in all the right places. The leather was soft and smooth without feeling slippery. The automatic shifter handle fits just right in your palm, and also is available with a clutchless-shift feature that allows you to get some of the fun of a standard transmission without the footwork. I didn't try this feature out though, as the 4-speed seemed totally competent and was like left in 'Sport' mode. I'm not the biggest fan of automatic transmissions, but this one I could live with very happily. It didn't hunt around alot, and when I got on it, it would oblige me with quick, smooth upshifts.
 

  I like the way the dash is shaped; it's almost cockpit-like. Very sporty and involving. Being black didn't hurt much either. This is not a neutral, just-from-point-A-to-point-B-only-transportation type car. It LIKES to be driven, and is not subtle about it. The styling alone should tell you that. Anyways, back to the dash and controls: most of them were pretty intuitive except for the multi-purpose dual climate controls, which was a bit confusing in whether you were turning it on or making it colder. But as far as the rest of the climate controls, and stereo and CD controls, they were pretty simple. Also, the aforementioned controls are also located on the steering wheel, for even easier access.
  

  This car was also equipped with EyeCue, a Heads Up Display (HUD). Basically, it reflects information onto the windshield in light green letters (which the brightness, or even if you want it on, is entirely controllable) which is REALLY nice for keeping your attention on the road. It tells you your speed, the station on the stereo you've just selected and which blinker you've just engaged. Very handy and a thoughtful touch.
   

  It also had a sunroof, which is power operated, and comes with a shade you can pull over it if it's too hot out.
   

  But my favorite part about this car......the ENGINE!!! The GTP comes standard with an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 3.8-liter Supercharged V6 making 240 horses (@ 5200 rpm) and a stout 280lb-ft. of torque (@ a relatively low 3200rpm) which is phenomenal for this class. It outmuscles nearly everything that's in it's class, and even some above it (i.e. Lexus ES 300). It's really nice to have all that power, even with A/C running full blast. I even had a problem with going on upramps and catching up to people who were already almost on the highway. FABULOUS!! It's an absolute blast turning off the traction control and flooring it and hearing that satisfying squeal of the tires, and watching one of my favorite gadgets on this car, the 'Boost' gauge, light up to show you exactly how much 'Boost' the supercharger was making. Hehe, what fun!! To top it off, the engine has a nice note, low and throaty, and the supercharger didn't spoil that much. You could discern it, but really only when it was really spooling out. Overall, a great combination and  even the fact that it's a front-wheel drive car did not bring the fun factor down much.
   

  Fuel mileage is pretty good considering the power it's making, and should get about 18mpg in the city and 28mpg on the highway.
  

  This car rode well, forgiving but sporty. I felt very in tune with the car, and with the road. The car lets you know what kind of road surface you're on, but does not broadcast it. Steering takes little effort, which is good for in town and long highway drives.
   

  It has a very airy greenhouse, which is good for visibility. Also the large sideview mirrors ensure a good view behind you as well as the rearview mirror which I had no problem with.
 

  Grand Prixs are pretty sharp cars (or at least I think so) and this particular GTP was no exception. I saw quite a few people turn to eye my sleek black sedan as I drove it around.
  

  My particular model, a pretty well loaded GTP model with leather, power sunroof, CD player, dual climate controls, power heated drivers' seat, power passenger seat, EyeCue, traction control, power windows/locks, and dual airbags stickered at only $27, 215.00 . A real bargain in my book, and you'd be hard pressed to find anything to match it's power for under $30k. 
   

  Truly, wider IS better.
