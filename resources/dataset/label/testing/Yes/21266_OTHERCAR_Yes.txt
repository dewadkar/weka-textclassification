            My husband and I began our car search at Saturn (LS2) and then went to Nissan (Maxima SE) When we were driving the Maxima the salesman said they compete with the Toyota Avalon.  I had never heard of it- so we stopped at the Toyota dealership.  The Avalon was a little out of our price range- so we drove the Camry XLE.  A mile into the test drive I knew this was the car for me.  The drive is very smooth and quiet.  All the controls were within reach and placed well.  

I had to have all the options.  I wanted leather, sunroof, spoiler, 6 disc in dash CD player, V-6, climate control.  Everything you can get on a Camry I got.  

My car is fun to drive with quick responses while at the same time giving me the comfortable ride I had grown accustomed to with my old Ford Taurus.  

Another plus is the size of the gas tank- 18.5 gallons. I like not having to go to the gas station every 5 days.<br><br>
