            The last car I purchased was a Nissan Maxima '89 and that was one of the wisest decisions I've made. Nissan hasn't lost its touch, I noticed, when I bought the new Maxima. Its wonderful, I feel like I'm at home when I drive it. Comfy, sleek, and safe--I could not have made a better decision. I have nothing negative to say as of yet and I hope I never will. In addition the performance is amazing, it feels like a race car. Unfortunately it does not corner very well, but I make up for that with my driving :-)I hope Nissan keeps coming out with cars like this! <br><br>
