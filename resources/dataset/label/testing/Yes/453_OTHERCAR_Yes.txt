            I bought a 1993 Mazda Protege back in 1996.  It wasn't originally on my short list of cars I was interested in but when I drove it, I really like it.  It is a 5 speed manual and felt tight to drive.  It was kind of fun to drive because it had a surprizing punch to it.  The car was straight and only had 39k on it and I purchased it for $6,300 from a dealer.  That was a good buy compared to the prices for honda's or toyota's.

The car has been a dream to own because I get over 30 miles to the gallon, and it has been very reliable.  I now have about 95k on it and have had very little work done on it outside of regular maintenance.  I plan to sell it next summer.

I've had a couple problems with the car.  First, it's not exactly a powerhouse.  I know I first mentioned that it was fun to drive but it really is more quick than it is fast and second it's kind of small.  I'm 6'3 and it's a little small for me but that's to be expected for this kind of car.  It's also not the best looking car on the block but if your looking for an economical and reliable way to get to work, I very highly recommend the Mazda Protege. <br><br>
