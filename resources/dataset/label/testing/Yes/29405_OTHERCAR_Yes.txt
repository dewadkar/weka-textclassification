            My impulse to pledge down 50K on a Boxster was from a 3hr road trip to New York city when I saw this black Boxster with top down.  It was such magnetic just to watch it.  I even footed my gas couple times inviting it for a race with my Altima (I don't know what I was thinking), but the Boxster just coolly ignored me, cruising at its own pace in the back drop of the New England fall.  Then I ended up just following it all the way to the city, contouring every curve of its sexy butt.

I got the standard Boxster with 212 horse power.  I don't think I need the S model's extra 40 horse power because the basic Boxster has already given me powerful 0-60mph feel, probably thanks to its spontaneous manual 5-gear response, and 23-26 mpg gas mileage.  However, I do feel lack of power when it reaches 100mph+, but three reasons convince me it is actually a good thing.  One is I wouldn't be too nervous looking out for cops to enjoy driving; two is I save gas mileage by not going with a bigger engine; three is I enjoy top down more while in normal relaxed highway breeze.  In bottom, I am already the stylest car on road and I don't need to drive recklessly for approval.

The amenity options I got were Sport package, PSM, and metallic paint.  The essentials I looked into the Sport Package were the wind deflector and CD sound package.  The wind deflector does help keeping my hat from blowing away while top down at 80mph, but girls usually have to re-comb their hair after each ride.  The stereo has very satisfying base and tremble, even with top down, but often the symphony from Boxster engine's humming and roaring keeps my stereo off most of time.  PSM traction control is only because of the winter icy road in New England, so it is unnecessary in dry weather.  Metallic paint has lot more color choices and shinier look than the standard color.

The handling of the Boxster is silky.  The half-brushed-aluminum-half-leather gear shaft is nicely shaped, and its shifting is precise and responsive.  My favorite is practicing 0-60mph entering a curved highway ramp.  I always feel myself like a bullet shooting out of the ramp while the tires still track the road like rail.  And brake is powerful.  The convertible top can be opened/closed while I am waiting at a red light (12 sec).  The leather seat is comfortable even for 6 hour long distance, and the leg space is roomy enough to fit my snow board.  The storage has plenty at both doors, seat back, and gear console, not even counting the CD shelf right beneath the stereo and the famous double-trunk I always show off to others.

The 17-inch wheel with Porsche logo wheel cap adds Porsche brand name pride to my cars.  However, like other expensive and rare Porsche parts, the tire is $400 each for the original Michelin Pilot brand and usually not in stock.  Plus you have to change both side tires for $800 even if only one gets flat so that thread pattern and worn level could match for ultimate performance.

The cup holder does exist, but too shadow to hold McDonald medium drink cup.  If I do sudden accelerate, the coke is very likely to flip out.

The maintenance is almost none.  For my 2001 model, oil changed once last year.  However the air conditioning stopped working at 27K miles.  Dealer also found oil leak in rear of engine.  The oil leak must be minimal because no stains in my garage floor.  All are fixed in warranty, which is 4 year/50k.  

The last important reason I got this Boxster is because the friendliness of Manhattan Motor Porsche dealers in New York.  They treated me the same as those shopping for Farrari, Carrera, RollsRoyce from them.  The Boxster was surrounded by those super cars in their showroom so they had to move them all out just to let me test drive, not even "are you going to buy today?"  I told them I can just test drive another Boxster parked outside, but they said I had to test the color exactly I choose.  And when I came back 1 month later, I even negotiated down $3000 without getting any cheap look.  I also like VIP treatment for the only two rare dealer visits and the sexy follow-up calls that almost melt me.  Compared to my shopping for Z3, BMW dealers were too arrogant to talk to me, as if I couldn't afford it, not saying that BMW dealers never negotiate.  No wonder JD Power rated Porsche as number 1 on 7/8/03 news release.  Say hi to the kind gentleman Richard at Manhattan Motor if you are car shopping in New York.
