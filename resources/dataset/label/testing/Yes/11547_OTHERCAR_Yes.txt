            My husband and I recently purchased a 1999 Jeep Cherokee for use as a &quot;mommy-mobile&quot; expecting to soon have a child.  We chose the Jeep Cherokee because it was affordable yet a very nice vehicle for the price.  Sporty looking and not nerdy like the mini-van - something I'd be proud to drive.  

We love having the 4-wheel drive because we live in the mountains and get a lot of snow and it handles great.  The construction feels solid and safe and has a driver's side airbag.  

The front seats are comfortable but I'm not so sure about the back seat.  For kids they're okay, but an adult would be uncomfortable for a long ride.  The back doors are pretty narrow and a little hard for an adult to get in through, but it's great for kids and leaning in to get baby from the carseat is no problem.  

There is plenty of room in the very back for lots of luggage, our 2 dogs or whatever my husband wants to haul around - it's great!  I love it for driving around town - it's compact enough that I can park anywhere and has a sharp turning radius and it gets good gas mileage as well.  Long trips are also comfortable - at least for me.  My husband who is six feet tall says he feels pretty cramped driving it, but for me (5'6&quot;) it's perfect.  

I love my Cherokee and think it's an affordable vehicle that has it all and would be great for a new family like us or maybe a college student or perhaps older people whose children have left.  It is definitely not a vehicle for a family with multiple teenagers - there's just not enough room in the back seat.  Also - large or tall men may not want it as their primary vehicle.<br><br>
