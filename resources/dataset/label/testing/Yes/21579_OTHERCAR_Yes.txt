               I'm not really a car expert, so maybe I'm just bragging about my luxurious ride.  I recently purchased a used 1995 Dodge Intrepid ES.  To start off, I was brought up to to think the Dodge was God's gift to the automobile industry.  I knew I would make my father proud.
   To be perfectly frank, the car is amazing.  In my eyes, it is luxury at an affordable price. I'll start off with what's important to me, comfort and style.  The lavish interior provides a modern and sophisticated look.  It took me days (and a call to Dodge which I'll talk about later) to figure out all the gadgets.  
   Underneath the hood there is a monstrous engine that I never hear.  Quite possibly because there is also a magnificent factory stereo installed.  What's even better is that I always feel safe.  The car never seems unstable and is forever yielding total control to the driver.
   My one complaint with the purchase is not with the car, but with the company.  The customer service has much to be desired.  When called to investigate what a curious button did (I didn't want to be ejected through the moonroof), a consultant politely told me that it was there for looks.  I later found the function on the internet, on a site not even related to Dodge.
   But barring any more run-ins with the customer service department, I'm sure my car and I will be very happy together for a very long time.<br><br>
