            I just purchased a 96 Ford Explorer Limited Edition and can't wait to take it on a long trip.  I love my Explorer, It rides so smooth with the air ride system and the leather seats make it so comfortable. Living in a snowy climate the 4-wheel drive was a must and I always feel confident with my Explorer.  This being my second Explored I knew I could count on this SUV, I feel safe and secure taking it on a 2000 mile trip away from home!<br><br>
