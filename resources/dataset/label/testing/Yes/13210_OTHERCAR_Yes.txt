            I've had my A70 for about 2 wks, have shot about 100 pics and am very, very happy with it.  I'm a complete novice when it comes to photography and this is my first digital camera (I formerly had a simple point and shoot for 10 yrs, but it died).  Extremely easy to use in "Automatic" mode (ie, point and shoot mode), just as I wanted. The fact that my wife has no complaints is great testimony to its ease of use because she is prone to complain about these things.   Also, movie mode quite easy to use.  There's lots of features which I did read up on and they too are easy to use if you choose, but you don't have to (eg, shooting in low light conditions, shooting things that are moving quickly, etc).  The fact that it includes a printed manual (vs a PDF file) is also a plus if you want to read up on these features.  

Battery life (4 AA) has met my expectations (4 alkalines were good for the first 100 pics but that included lots & lots of reviewing which they say eats batteries).  Many folks recommend that you get NiMh rechargables but I'm not so sure you need to if you use it like I do, ie, let it sit on the mantel until the kids act cute and then take a few pics.  NiMh lose there charge in 30 or so days even when completely unused, alkalines last for years.  Like all digital cameras, the CF card that comes with it is way too small (16 mb) but I picked up a 512 mb at pcmall.com for 119 w/free shipping & 25 rebate!  512 is more than adequate, even if you shoot some movies.  

The box comes with 2 editing software packages, one by Cannon (Digital Camera Solutions) which is is basic and easy to use, and one by ArcSoft which is much more functional but a bit confusing to this novice (why can't software vendors follow Windows standards for menuing?).  It was not clear to me at first why I had 2 packages let alone which I was supposed to use when, and I find some things about the ArcSoft package very annoying.

My only complaint is shutter lag, especially pronounced when AF Assist (autofocus assist) is on -- it takes just over a full second to take the pic which is more annoying than it sounds when you're trying to get a kid to keep a pose.  Since none of the reviews I read mentioned this as a problem I wonder if it's a "feature" of all digital cameras.  I ended up turning AF assist off and that helps, but does not eliminate, the problem.

All-in-all I'm very happy with the camera.
