              We needed a new family vehicle.  We had an SUV with nearly 200,000 miles on it and a bad reputation coming out on it.  At 26 and 31 my husband and I decided we weren't quite ready for a mini-van.  So we test drove a Z71 Silverado 1500 with 4 doors and 4 wheel drive.  It was love at first drive!
  I had drove a Silverado about three years ago while I was pregnant and found it difficult to get in and out of the truck even with the addition of a step.  Our 2000 Silverado sets lower to the ground for easy access.  It comfortable sets six people and has more leg room then my car.  The carseat is easy to put in on either side of the truck, and our daughter sets up higher.  She is able to see out easily and is much happier on trips then she had been in the past.  In front the middle &quot;seat&quot; flips down for a comfortable arm rest and allows for easy access to the back seat to retrieve lost toys. 
  We drive across three states to visit family and the drive is the smoothest, quietest and most comfortable that we have had.  
  SUV's are getting a lot of bad reviews from the media right now due to safety issues.  For those of us with families who aren't ready to buy a traditional family car and don't like the reputation that SUV's are getting, the Silverado is the way to go.  Plenty of room, smooth driving and most importantly you don't feel like you are driving your parents car.<br><br>
