            This digicam has a lot of nice bells and whistles. It records movie with sound. Has 5 automatic picture modes, lets you set a few manual features, like exposure comp. and ISO speed. You can even tag pictures for sending to specific email address semi-automatically after download. It does not have much in the area of manual controls. Comes with 16MB internal memory. Has a rechargeable LI battery. There is a 1-2 second lag from button press to shutter release. It also has an indoor/outdoor LCD display which works pretty good outside! 

Picture quality: 
With the 4 megapixel resolution, this camera takes great pictures. Pictures are sharp, have a great color tone to them and even brighter than other digital camera images. 

Zoom Zoom Zoom 
The 10x total zoom (3x optical and 3.3x digital) really helps to take pictures that are far away. Kodak claims you can view the LCD screen both indoors and out, it sometimes is hard to view it when you&#146re outdoors. The 1.8 inch LCD screen both visible outdoors and indoors, it also provides you a screen to look at for the pictures you just took, also allowing you to see the video you are taking or just took. When reviewing pictures, you can magnify the pictures up to 4 times. 

Menu Options :
The camera also has different menu options where you can set your own color contrast, pick if you want to use you internal memory or your disk, take pictures in sephia mode or even set you camera to take in long time exposure mode. 

Different Settings:
The different settings the LS 443 offers allows you to take pictures in different settings. The settings are Auto, landscape, sport, night and a close-up mode help to take the perfect picture in the perfect situation. Most of these settings are pretty self explainatory. 

Battery:
The battery life of this camera is very good. It can hold a charge for up to 5 hours. I took this camera on a trip to mountains for one week and the battery never died.  

With all the features, and the included one-touch docking station, this camera looks real good. Seems great for someone who wants a easy to use cam.
