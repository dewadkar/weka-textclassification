            When my wife and I went out looking for a new digital camera, we had a specific set of criteria in mind. We wanted a resolution of at least 3 Megapixels, the highest optical zoom we could find for a price, and an interface simple enough for my wife to operate without having to take a course. Needless to say, we wanted these for the most affordable price we could find. After comparing all the digital cameras out there, we settled on the HP Photosmart 850 as the best value in its range.

With a 4.1 Megapixel resolution, the quality of the photos taken with this camera is excellent, even when the pictures are blown up to 20&#148 by 30.&#148 This camera features an 8x optical zoom plus 7x digital zoom for a total of 56x.  The optical zoom was the highest we saw in its price range.

The menu on this camera is very intuitive and easy to use. We were actually able to figure out most of the basic functions in the store on the display model. My wife has yet to examine some of the more esoteric features on this camera, like video and audio motion capture. However, another nice feature is that the camera allows you to override the automatic mode to manually select the ISO exposure, white balance, and other pre-programmed controls in the Auto mode. The only downside on the actual operation of this camera is the slowness of the Autofocus. There is a very noticeable lag between pressing the shutter and the actual picture being taken. This makes it very difficult to frame and focus pictures of moving people or objects. I would not recommend this camera for sports photography for this reason.

The 850 offers a variety of options for downloading pictures. The camera can be hooked directly to a HP compatible printer via a USB cable to print pictures directly. You can also hook directly to a PC and send pictures directly to email addresses, files or printers straight from the camera using the on board menus. Battery life is about average, but because it uses AA batteries, in-camera battery charging is available using the optional HP Photosmart 8881 Digital Camera Dock. I recommend springing for the Dock, because downloading pictures from the camera drains battery power very quickly. The Dock also makes downloading pictures to your PC a breeze. The camera media for the 850 is the Sans Disk memory stick. The camera comes with a 16 MB stick, which will give you about 16 pictures at high resolution settings. You&#146ll probably want more capacity than that if you take a lot of pictures, since you&#146ll have to download the pictures before you can reuse the memory stick.

All in all, the HP Photosmart 850 is still probably one of the best values in its class. It is easy to use and takes great pictures with a minimum of tweaking by the user. The only downside is the slow Autofocus.
