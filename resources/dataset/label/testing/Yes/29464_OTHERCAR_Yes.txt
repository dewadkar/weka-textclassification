            I wrote my first epinion on my beloved 99 Wrangler Sport back in September 99, just one week after purchase...now I'm back with an update, and I love it more today than I did when I authored that first glowing report!  

During the last 8 months, I have driven my Wrangler on and off road, to work and on weekend road trips...I can't imagine ever driving anything else!  I love my Wrangler!  

Off Road...This is where the Wrangler shines!  I've traversed deep sand and uneven creeks, steep hills and rock piles, bridges made of tree trunks and paths littered with roots and vines.  My Wrangler conquered each challenge with unflinching ease.  The small size of the vehicle was especially handy when I unexpectedly came upon a solid end of a trail swallowed by dense forest...I was able to back up and turn the vehicle around in an incredibly small amount of space without becoming stuck in the deep and shifting sand!  This vehicle can definitely take you anywhere you want to go!

On Road...I leave the top down and only raise it in extreme weather.  So far, I've been lucky and have only been rained on twice!  However, the interior is waterproofed and with a little bit of TLC and the help of Armor All the wet weather has left no lingering reminder of its presence.  This is an incredibly fun vehicle to drive around town and on road trips and I often notice people staring as if thinking to themselves, &quot;I want one of those!&quot;. I've been on both sides, and being stared at is definitely more fun than doing the staring!!  Gas mileage improved with engine break-in and currently hovers at about 17-18 miles/gallon.

My 99 Wrangler (bought new in September 99) now has approximately 9000 miles on it.  The only, and I do mean ONLY annoying aspects of this vehicle are the road noise encountered at highway speeds (particularly with the top up) and the lack of storage space.  You learn quickly to travel very light!  Everything else is PERFECT!!  I wouldn't have it any other way!!<br><br>
