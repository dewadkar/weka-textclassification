            Well, I've had the "D" for just over a year now. I leased it new with a sticker price of just under $36,000. It currently has 12,500 miles on it. The Durango is aggressive looking, and has the muscle to back it up. The seats are comfortable. When using the heat, it heats quickly. The air comes out ice cold, and does not take long to become cold once you turn it on. The cockpit is laid out nice, all the controls are easy to reach, and you don't need to take your eyes off the road to do so. This has been one of the best cars/truck/suv I have owned. I'm typically a car person. I'm not big into trucks, but with a family of 4, plus my kids friends, it's hard to fit them all into a 4 door 5 passenger car. The "D" has a lot of room, and the 3rd row comes in handy often. Whether I need to hall stuff, or people, there is plenty of room. To me, the ride is not rough at all, in fact it seems to absorb the bumps much better than my previous car, a 96' Dodge Stratus. I have the 5.9L v8, SLT, 4x4, which has 245 hp, and 335 ft/lbs of torque, mated to a 4 speed automatic trans, limited slip differential and 3:92 rear end. This SUV has some serious get-up and go, but it comes with a price, you get to watch your gas needle go down. The avg. gas mileage for me is around 15-16 mpg. If you have a heavy foot, or like to play around a lot, don't expect anything over 12 mpg

I'm very satisfied with my Durango, having no problems what so ever. The only thing I can think of to change would be the gas tank, it needs to be larger. Having said that, I would still highly recommend this SUV.
