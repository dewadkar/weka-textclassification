            My dad gave me my Ford Taurus after I killed my first one. Yes, I have owned more than one Taurus. Not much choice in the matter, but when asked to choose between a Taurus and a Cougar, I took the Taurus. My first Taurus took a beating like no other car could. I ran over everything, what can you expect when you give a 16 yr old a car. Tauruses are tough cars. There is no other way to put it. When you run over curbs like a skateboarder and don't ned an alignment after then your car is tough. When you run over a oversized, bloated, dead German Shepard laying in the middle of the road and not tip over, your car is tough. Why do you think they call them bulls? I believe that Tauruses are good cars for beginner drivers because they are durable. Yes, it is true that I had no choice as to whether I owned a Taurus or not but they grow on you. My car is missing a few pieces of the exterior, like the striping, but it looks sleek and deceivingly fast. The interior is a drab grey but with plenty of decor, that can be fixed. I will admit that the inside is falling apart slowly, such as the AC knob that won't stay on or the panel that fell off a few months ago but it is roomy. The trunk holds TONS, I would never imagine having a bathroom sink, about 6 broken down boxes, and a bunch of other stuff I haven't seen in about a year and still have room for groceries! That is a good incentive. Speed is a different story. Don't expect really awesome pick-up if you own a car like this. The one way I have found that I get better pick-up when cutting someone off is to turn my AC off. Maybe you might get a little bigger push. Good luck though. I believe the only people that should NOT own a Taurus are the people who want a speedy car. If you take a Taurus over 75 the steering wheel shakes and it gets a little loud. City people should own Tauruses, same for First time owners, older drivers and everyone else. Overall, a Taurus is a good, VERY reliable car. It is truly as tough as a bull.<br><br>
