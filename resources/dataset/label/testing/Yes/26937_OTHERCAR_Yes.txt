            There are not enough words for me to describe my Camry. I have 98' model XLE with all the options. I truly love this car. Smooth, quiet and crazy fast. The engine is so smooth, that it would be spinning at redline and the passengers does not feel any vibration. Car is also very stable at speeds well over 100mph. My brother has the 97' model with the 4 cylinder, not as fast but feels smoother. I guess less weight. Neither of our cars has ever been to the dealership for any problems. My car has 19500 miles and my brother has 45100 miles. Once you drive a Camry, and not looking for an extra stiff sporty ride, chances are you will buy one or two. Built in America too. The only 'real' competition this car has is its big brother, the Lexus ES300. They are almost identical cars. <br>
