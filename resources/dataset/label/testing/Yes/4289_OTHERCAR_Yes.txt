            I think the new beetle combines sleek nineties styling without compromising the original beetle that we all love from the sixties and seventies.  I almost feel like a hippie chick when I'm driving my yellow beetle to work (at least until I have to go in the building and sit in my cubicle).  This car is just plain fun, it's really hard to be in a bad mood when you are driving this...maybe you shouldn't even call it driving, it's more like &quot;tooling around&quot;.

One of the best things for me is the adjustable front seat.  I am only 5'2&quot; and have always had trouble getting in the proper position in any car I've driven.  This car has a lever on the side that actually cranks the seat UP so I can look over the hood and be comfortable at the steering wheel.  The seat has also proven to be very comfortable on my back, it promotes proper posture.  

Maneuverability is another big plus.  With the size of this car, it is so easy to zip in and out of small places, change lanes, parallel park, etc.  

While I think the compact size of the car is a plus, others may find it to be a drawback.  My brother-in-law, who is 6'2&quot;, cannot comfortably ride in this car...he doesn't have enough leg room, and barely enough head room.  I always let him sit up front if he has to ride with me because there is no way he could get in the back seat. I think it would be uncomfortable for two large people to ride side by side, I think their shoulders would be touching because although this car is wider than the old beetle, it is still more narrow than a lot of other cars.

I have driven this car on a few wintry, icy days and have found it to have great traction, and was able to stop easily with the anti-lock brakes.  And we are talking upstate New York winters!

For the price I think my car has a lot of nice features:  a great sounding BOSE stereo, keyless entry, security system, cruise control, cd player, power windows and probably more that I cannot think of.

Do not buy this car if you don't want to attract attention.  Not only do people stare at it on the road, but complete strangers want to know everything about my car as well (mostly women who want to convince their husbands that they should get the new beetle as their next car).  I like the fact that it is very easy to spot in the parking lot, I no longer have to search and search for my vehicle.  I also think that the yellow color is actually a safety feature, making me more visible to other drivers in low light/blizzard conditions.
