            I bought my Toyota Corolla (CE) three years ago in June. I just renewed the licensee and intend to keep it many years more.

At the time I bought it, I just had a very bad experience with my old car Hyundai Excel (I wrote a review on it before). So the main thing I looked for when I tried to find myself a new car was: reliability.

Toyota certainly has the reputation to build very reliable car. And the price tag on Corolla is also very attractive to an about-to-graduate college student. But before I made my final decision, I did an intensive research to compare Corolla with other cars that were in the same price range.

The cars that I compared with Corolla were: Ford Escort, Chevrolet Cavalier , Geo Prizm, Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic, and Dodge Neon. I don�t want to list here all the details I got for each car. You can get that kind of information easily by looking at many web sites that sell cars. I just want to share with you my conclusion.

Among the seven cars that I looked at (including Corolla), Ford Escort seemed to the cheapest of all.  I mean with essentially the same features, Ford Escort can go as low as $12,000, while the other cars are more in the range of $14,000. Nissan Sentra didn�t have many choices of feature package, and the price was on the high end of the seven.

So what are the general features I looked for? Well, I looked for 4 Drs sedan with 4 cylinder engine, around 1.5 liter and above 100 horse power, automatic transmission, radio and cassette will be preferred, rear defrost, power steering, a preferred power window or power lock, and a good gas mileage. Toyota Corolla CE edition certainly includes most if not all the features I wanted, and for the other cars that have different variety of package choice, I only compared the price for the package I wanted.

Chevrolet Cavalier has the best bodyline design to my taste among the seven cars. Also it has the biggest engine at 2.2 liter with over 120-horse power. This is a welcome feature for me because I live in Midwest. Also, the internal design of Cavalier is pretty fresh and sharp, again, fit my taste.

Dodge Neon also has a very attractive bodyline design. And it was very popular in 1997 with a very nice price tag too (a little lower than Corolla). Its engine is not as big as Cavalier (2.0 liter), but with more horse power (132). Again that is a very attractive feature to me

Honda Civic is probably the most expansive one among the seven (about a thousand dollar more than the average).  It has similar size engine and horsepower to Corolla, and Honda is well known as building very reliable car too. It has the best gas mileage among the seven, with over 30 mile per gallon in the city and as high as 38 on highway. 

Geo Prizm, as I was told at the time, was essentially the same car as Corolla mechanically. The bodyline and internal designs of Prizm is somewhat different from Corolla, but the engine and most of other parts are built in the same factory. So it would be generally expected that it has the same quality as Corolla. And the price of Prizm is slightly lower than Corolla, but still close to $14,000. 

So how did I end up buying Corolla after I realized that each of the cars I looked at had some features that really attracted me? Corolla�s bodyline design is OK, but not as eye-catching as Cavalier and Neon. Corolla�s internal design is modest, not as good as Prizm and Cavalier. Corolla certainly doesn�t have the powerful engine as Cavalier and Neon. And Corolla doesn�t have the impressive gas mileage as Civic.

Well, I finally decided to buy Corolla for the following reasons:
1. It�s very reliable. The only other one comes close is Civic.

2. It retains its value very well after years. This is the most important factor to make me bought Corolla. Other six just can�t compare with Corolla in this catalogue.

3. Its price is in the middle of the seven cars. I don�t want to pay the extra thousand dollars for Civic although I might get it back in years from gas. Or will I?

4. The engine is not so powerful, but I will mostly use it in the city.

5. The Toyota dealer I talked to has very good service package, including a discount on every oil change in the first 36,000 miles, and discount on 15,000 miles checkup and 30,000 mile checkup. I didn�t find any other dealers in town offering similar package.

So I bought the Corolla, and I have used it for three years now. What do I think after three years? Well,  I would give it a 9 out of 10 score.

The one point loss from a perfect 10 came from the following reasons:
1. Corolla has a small manufactory problem. When the wind is strong outside and you open the rear window on one side of the car, it will create a low-tone noise inside the car, not too bad, but once you realize it�s there, it�s very annoy. This has something to do with the design of the rear window and the internal space. I have heard similar complains from other people. 

2. Corolla is indeed a very reliable car, as it didn�t give me any problem, well until my last oil change before my three-year manufactory warranty expired. I was told at the oil change that my transmission seemed to be leaking. And it turned out that a panel gasket was broken and need to be replaced. If the oil change person didn�t catch it, I could end up having more serious problem with the transmission.

Both of these problems were small enough that I still enjoy my three years with Corolla very much. As I said in the beginning, I intend to keep this car for many years, and I know that by the time I want to sell this car, I still can get more money out of it than any of the other six cars in the same price range. Isn�t that wonderful to know that the money you put into the car stays there longer, and meanwhile you can count on the car to do what it is supposed to do?
