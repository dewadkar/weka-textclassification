            My mom has one and I didn't see a car in my price range I wanted. I already was comfortable in her car.  So I bought it.  It had some problems, still does.  The winsheilds leaks and the water comes down through the kick panels, when it rains hard I get Spirit Lake in my passenger floor.  Just need to get the windsheild sealed better.  My RPM does some weird stuff after driving a long time.  It will stay at 2000 RPM when I let go of the gas, making the car feel like it is holding back.  There are a few rattles, no biggy. I love driving it!  It is very fast. I have 3.0L Mitsubishi V6.  I race the car on the street and usually beat any car.  I wonder how them Acura and Mustang drivers feel when &quot;DODGE GRANDMA RIDE&quot; smokes em!!!!!  The cars idling motor went out a few month ago, about $100.  I got my stereo system hooked up.  Tinted windows makes my car look alot nicer.  I think this car is good for teens to grandmas.  If your a teen and want to smoke some sports cars get the V6.  Or better yet get the RT. The fastest sedan around!  The car is good for everyone and everything.  It is nice enough I take it to the waterfront every weekend. It is very easy to drive.  It is okay on gas.  I eat mine up the way I drive. The car accels so fast I can't help it.<br><br>
