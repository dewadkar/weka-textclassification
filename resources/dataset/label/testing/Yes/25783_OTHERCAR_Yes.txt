              I purchased my Altima GXE in Feb. of 2001.  I bought it a Ford dealership (Rochester Ford Toyota in Rochester, MN) who has adopted a no haggle price plan.  I paid $5200, $3500 for the car and $1700 for an extended warranty.  The mileage was 109,XXX when I bought it.  I now regret buying the warranty, as I did not use it.  
  My car is a medium blue, with a light bluish interior. I have a 5 speed manual. It has the power cassette(now aftermarket CD, windows/locks/mirrors,  cruise, a/c, rear spoiler, and ABS.   I have had a few electrical things go on the car, like some dash light(the cruise main light, the HVAC hot/cold light, etc.)  Everything however is still functional.  I especially enjoy the ABS in the winter.
  Since buying the car, I am at 163,XXX (I commute 100 miles a day, 6 days a week and drive on vacation a lot.)  I have had absolutely no problems mechanically (at least that weren't my fault) and have never doubted my car.  I have had the belts replaced, the brakes done, new tires, and some clutch work.  This has been hands down the most dependable car I have ever owned, and have no doubts I will be getting high 200's for mileage before it dies.  For MPG I am getting anywhere from 25-32.  I do a lot of highway travel, but also have a lead foot.
   I enjoying driving the car, especially with the manual.  It makes for a fun time.  My clutch is a little stiff, and shifter a tad notchy, but I am used to it.  The gauges are in good line of sight, and HVAC/radio controls easy to use.  Cupholders could be in a better place, but I have a radio with a remote, so I don't mind.  For the most part, the car is very comfortable, but a tad cramped.  I have driven a friends Altima (1995, auto) from WI to North Carolina, via the Smoky Mtns.  I not only brought back what we had moved down there in  a MINIVAN, but was not very fatigued.  I drove that car for almost 3 days straight, with not one hint of strain or problem.  That same car has also been driven to Las Vegas and back from WI, with no problems.  
   I rarely carry rear seat passengers, so I don't really have much to say about the back.  The trunk holds a fair amount of things, though it's a pain to pack around the trunk hinges.
   Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with my car, and dread the day I have to replace it.  It has become like a familiar best friend, someone you can always count on.  I would definately recommend any year Altima to anyone.  However....there's always a lemon for every car maker, so don't let those scare you!!!
