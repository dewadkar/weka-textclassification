            Let me first say, this is my first review for a car. But I feel so strongly about my new Scion that I just had to put in my two cents worth.

When I first got into the market to buy a new car (or used), it was because my Ford Escort had finally bit the dust after only 7 years. Understand, I had done the usual maintenance (oil, filter, tune-ups, etc.) consistently, but that didn't stop the engine from freezing up. So, there I was, no car, two kids and needing transportation. After a lot of research, I came across the Scion on the web.

At first glance, I thought "wow, what a weird looking thing." At second glance, I thought "wow, what a funky, weird looking thing." By third glance, I was all but hooked.

The price was right (no haggling), and the standard features were perfect for me. Normally, I am not fussy when it comes to cars, but I did think that this time I should try to find something more durable and maybe a little fun. With the xb I hit the jackpot.

I went down to my local Scion (Toyota) dealer and test drove one. I'm use to a 5-speed manual transmission and they happened to have one on the lot. Normally, with 5-speeds, there is a breaking-in period. Not so with this one. Immediately, I was able to shift comfortably (even though the stick was a little stiff) and zip along the road with no problems. The seats were comfortable and almost too roomy (I'm 5'6" at 125 lbs so I don't really need a ton of space). I also noticed that, although the car is small and boxy on the outside, inside it's so roomy that you almost feel as if you're in an SUV (which means for the first week or so, I was overcompensating on turns and such).

I also, for the first time in a long time, sat in the back seats just to check the space. Talk about cavernous. Now admittedly, I can't drive from the back, so I can't say what it would feel like on the road, but according to my teenager, it's not bad.

After buying the car, I took several friends (including some tall male friends) for test drives. They found the head and leg room to be more then adequate--front and back, and the ride smooth. We then went on the highway. By downshifting into fourth as I merged into traffic (which is something the manual suggests), I was able to get the speed needed to merge quickly and safely. The wind and engine noise was appreciably low at high speeds. The ride was smooth unless the road was especially bumpy and then you really only felt what you would have anyway. The car was able to hug curves with no real leaning, stop quickly in traffic and keep up easily with the "big boys".

So now I've had my Scion for over two months (since August 30) and I must say I'm still as happy with it as I was when I first bought it, maybe even happier. It's a fun car. And the looks and comments I get doesn't hurt either. Even those who don't like the look find it interesting. This car has attitude with a capital A. The stick has gotten smoother as I drive more, the cd player is awesome, the seats are comfortable (not fluffy like a Cady, nor hard like a skateboard on wheels) and roomy, the windows are large so visibility is excellent, the gas mileage is good (30/34), it feels solid (not cheap), and after about two days, I even liked the speedometer being placed the way it is (in the middle and up on the dashboard instead of being behind the steering wheel). All the nooks and cranies are good for storage, and the room in back with the seats down is large enough to hold a new dining table comfortably (which I did the second week of driving it) or a ten speed bike (third week).

All in all, this has been an absolutely great experience.

addendum:

Just to review the interior more (per review): First--the pioneer am/fm/cd/mp3 player is standard and ready for satellite control radio. There are six speakers inside which makes for a great, jammin' ride. As mentioned before, the speedometer is not behind the steering wheel. Instead you will find more storage nooks and crainies (3 I believe) plus another in the center front and on the side above the glove box. There are two cup holders in front, one in back and a cd holder center front beneath the air conditioner/heater. Clock and odometer is in the top center next to the speedometer. Door pockets in front (not sure about the back since I don't sit back there). 

60/40 split folding seats in back. There is suppose to be a removable seat in back but so far I haven't found out how. The seats fold flat however (including the passenger front seat), so I'm not sure if you really need the back seat to be removed. There are two hidden storage areas in back, one for the spare tire, and one to store stuff (I have cleaning material in mine). Also a first aid kit under the front seat (standard). The seats in back hold three (room enough for adults--not just kids) and all three have 3-point seat belts (same as front).

Also standard are power windows, power door locks, adjustable tilt steering wheel, keyless entry, driver and passenger front airbags, abs brakes and vehicle skid control (traction control), rear wiper and defroster, and privacy glass.

Mine is a 5-speed 4 cylinder with 108hp @ 6,000 rpm so I'm not really up on the automatic transmission. Manual is standard with the xb (the automatic is about $800 extra).

Everything I've written about my Scion is standard. Price is $14,165 (including shipping and handling). There are lots for goodies you can get to "personalize" this car as Toyota says but I didn't need them. Also, from what I understand there is also a growing aftermarket of accessories for the Scions. However, the only things I added were an extended warranty (something I always do) and identification tags for "theft control".

All in all, I still say--happy, happy, joy, joy.
