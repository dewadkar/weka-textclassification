            I have put in 118K on the '96 Subaru Legacy Brighton wagon that I purchased when it was new. The total cost of repairs for this time has been $147 for a faulty brake switch! (This excludes normal maintenance and regular replacement items like brakes, bulbs, timing belt, etc.) The original tires and brakes lasted longer than the second sets that I have put on. The only thing wrong at this time is that the light on the radio dial has failed.  No other car I have ever owned (including Hondas, Chrysler, Fords, and BMW) has ever been so trouble-free. 

I find the seats to be quite comfortable even for long trips. The cloth upholstery has held up extremely well with no indication of wear. The car is parked outside all the time. The paint job is still good. The air conditioning still works fine without refilling of the coolant. 

On the negative side, the engine is adequate, but weak. Acceleration is slower than I would like. It may be my imagination, but this car seems to have attracted more dings than other cars that I have owned. There is a faint rattle that I have had from the beginning that I have not been able to track down. These problems do not outweigh the benefits.

I've read a lot of reviews by people raving about the reliability of the Subarus. From what I have seen so far with my car, these comments are true.
