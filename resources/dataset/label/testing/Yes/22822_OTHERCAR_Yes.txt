            This car looks and feels like a Toyota.  It is a small, sterile car lacking in charm.  There's nothing to hate, but there is nothing to love.  It could be called the Milk Toast.

I recently rented the Alero GX model for a couple weeks.  Although this car is a stable-mate of the Grand Am, it feels smaller inside.  I really like the Grand Am, but this car didn't win me over.  The Alero is OK, but I wouldn't develop an emotional attachment to it.  

What I Like:

The fuel economy is excellent.  My car was equipped with the 4 cyl engine and auto transmission.  I measured 31 mpg on a trip consisting of Interstate driving and a couple tanks of gas.  In town and limited highway driving mix, I measured 27 mpg.  This was a vast improvement over the 14 mpg I get on my truck.

The acceleration is good, especially considering this is a 4 cyl engine.  You're not going to beat Corvettes or Mustangs away from the stoplight, but they are not getting 25 mpg.  

The brakes are good, delivering smooth, quick stops.  I never triggered the ABS, even in snow.  The brakes perform as well as any modern sedan.  

Traction is nothing short of remarkable.  I drove through deep snow, with the belly dragging, and it pulled strong.  The car handled a muddy road and never faltered.  This is better than the average FWD car.

The car has a nice, solid feel.  With 15,000 miles on the odometer, my car was free of rattles and everything worked.  It was very quiet and smooth over small bumps.  Larger bumps had a loud "thud".  

The Sound System is very good.  Fair bass response, but the remaining audio spectrum was rich and full.  I played CDs and listened to FM quite a bit and it was very pleasant.  Above average for a factory radio.  

Dislikes

The seat feels like a park bench.  It is hard and the shape is wrong for my American behind.  I found myself reaching for pain killers after about 100 miles.  The seat just isn't comfortable, it is overly firm and has a funny tilt on the seat cushion.  I suspect the human factors engineers had lots of padding on their tails.

The trunk deck lid design is awful.  Open the trunk with some light snow and the trunk is suddenly full of the snow from the top of the lid.  Were your objective to efficiently dump all the snow in the trunk, you couldn't improve upon this design.  I dumped ice and snow all over $100K worth of test equipment.  Thank Goodness I had it packed in field cases.

The interior space is suited to small people.  I'm a big guy, 6 feet and 220 pounds.  The headroom is non-existent.  Plus, this car is about 2 sizes too small for me.  My passenger and I kept bumping shoulders and elbows.  It's not quite as roomy as First Class on the plane.  Move to the back seat and think of "coach". 

The steering is so quick I would call it twitchy.  There is a slight, "on center" dead zone, but the car is turning if you think about moving the wheel.  Brakes are good.

All in all, this is a good car for my 80 year old mom.  She is petite, lives in an area without snow and plays the radio loud.
