            To begin with, my wife and I never wanted to own or drive a minivan.  However, the impending arrival of our third child motivated us to shop for a �practical� family vehicle.  We thus began our search for a mid-sized SUV with 3rd row seating.

We started out looking at the Mercedes-Benz ML 320 and Dodge Durango.  We found that access to the optional 3rd row passenger seats was inadequate with two children occupying car seats in the 2nd row.  Realizing that a mid-sized SUV wouldn�t meet our needs, we begrudgingly set out to obtain a suitable minivan.  This became a completely utilitarian purchase for us now, which turned out to be a powerful negotiating tool.  The various dealers that we visited were keenly aware that they had to SELL us a minivan.

After several weeks of research and test drives we narrowed our choices down to the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Town &amp; Country (T&amp;C).  We ultimately decided on the all-wheel-drive version of the T&amp;C LXi.  The key factors in our decision were the car-like ride, luxury appointments, interior room and all-wheel-drive.  Chrysler was also offering 0.9% APR financing for 60 months which made our decision that much easier.  

A few months after our purchase, my wife (6-months pregnant at the time), our two young children and I journeyed to Florida in the T&amp;C LXi for our summer vacation.  We logged more than 3,500 miles in the vehicle over a three-week period.  Although we were dreading the drive, it turned out to be quite comfortable and enjoyable (most likely due to the on-board TV/VCR that kept the children entertained).  When a very pregnant woman is able to travel in a vehicle for 8+ hours a day without a complaint, you know it�s a comfortable ride...  What more can I say?

Summary:  This minivan handles like a luxury sedan and is a pleasure to drive on long trips or around town.  The optional all-wheel-drive system with 3.8 liter V-6 engine and 4-wheel disc brakes provides excellent responsiveness in all driving conditions.  We are very satisfied with the versatility of this vehicle as both a people and cargo hauler.  I highly recommend the all-wheel-drive Chrysler Town &amp; Country LXi, it is a terrific all-around family vehicle.
