            We were shopping for a subcompact sedan, and after test-driving the cars, I can say that the Chevy Prizm is the best subcompact out there. Yes, I know it's actually a Corolla with minor differences, but I personally prefer the Chevrolet version because we have always owned GM models... so basically I am recommending both the Corolla and Prizm. But I digress. The Prizm I drove was a fun, easy-going car. You know how some cars just make you feel at home behind the wheel? This is one of those. The view out is great, with big, low-cut windows that make the cabin feel very open. The dashboard is simple, too. Even though there is only one engine choice, the 1.8-liter four, this was the quickest-feeling car of all the ones I test-drove. Plus, the steering is nice and solid, and it rides really smoothly. There's also decent room in back and more trunk space than our '94 Olds Cutlass. Hmm, bad points, there were a couple. The seats aren't the most comfortable of the cars I tested (that was the Cavalier), and it won't handle like a sports car--soft suspension makes it roll in the corners. But it's still a better balance than the others, especially considering the price tag. One last thing, just remember a Prizm is cheaper to buy originally, but Corolla holds its value better, so you get a better trade-in deal. So it depends on your financial situation, I guess, or, like in my case, brand loyalty. <br><br>
