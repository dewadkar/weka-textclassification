            My husband and I went out to look for a car and because we were just starting out we couldn't get conventional credit.  We ended up at a dinky &quot;Buy here, Pay here&quot; car dealership of sorts.

They didn't have very many decent cars there at all.  I was looking for a mid-size, 4 door vehicle that would get good gas mileage.  My husband was looking for a sporty car with a powerful engine and all the extras.

We test drove one car and looked at a few others and we ended up falling in love with a 1992 Ford Probe LX.  It was a teal green color and was fully loaded.  It had a power drivers seat, power windows and locks, tinted windows, leather interior, moon roof, cassette and CD player.  It had everything!!

Unfortunately, it also had a lot of problems that we didn't discover until after we had had it for a few months.  There was a clunking sound every time we went over a bump or turned a corner which we later learned was the axles.  They were bent and the boots were completely torn. We just recently paid $400.00 to have the axles replaced.  Then the drivers side window broke.  The regulator in it just stopped working and when I called around to find out about getting it fixed, I was told that it happens in every Probe and that it would cost about $450.00 to fix it.  Needless to say the window is still broken.  The next thing that happened was the car would start and then die, especially in the heat.  We still don't know the cause of this problem, but trying to figure it out we replaced the spark plugs, the spark plug wires, the fuel filter, and the transmission filter.  It was never fixed, but it hasn't done it in awhile either. The air conditioning works....sometimes.

The biggest problem right now is that the transmission is about to go out.  It revs before it will shift gears and our gas mileage is about 15.2 miles per gallon and getting worse by the day.  We are still trying to pay the car off and are debating whether or not to replace the transmission because it will cost about $2500.00 to fix because it is an automatic with a manual shift button.  That would mean that we are spending more on the transmission than the car is worth.

Overall, this car has been the absolute pits and is now known as the money pit.  Word to the wise: don't buy a used car with high mileage and stay away from Fords.<br><br>
