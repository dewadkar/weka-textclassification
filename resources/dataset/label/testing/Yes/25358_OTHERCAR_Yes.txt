            I bought this camera because it had features I needed for web photos, capable of high resolution, and under $300.

This camera is perfect for first time digital camera buyers, or those who want a digital that can produce good images, but is still affordable. The camera is small and light, like typical point and shoot 35mm cameras. It has an auto-focusing lens, built-in flash, red-eye reduction, self timer, macro to distance mode, 5 resolution settings, and more features. Also features an LCD screen image display, which can be switched off to save battery life. Images can be downloaded via USB or serial, to Mac or PC, or viewed on a TV screen, and all cables are provided.

Handles just like a regular point and shoot 35mm camera. Immediate view of image on LCD screen helps you determine whether you want to save or delete right then, instead of waiting until you download the images. Also, LCD screen lets you see exactly what you're shooting.

Came with a 4MB compact flash card, which only holds 6 images at the highest resolution. I purchased another 32MB card, which can hold 51 high resolution images. I also purchased the optional A/C adapter - mandatory if you're really going to use this camera! I also outfitted it with rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, as this camera really uses the battery power quickly. Comes with Photowise software, which is decent enough to do gentle image manipulations. You'll still need a higher end program if you want to really tweak them!

If you plan on just using your images for the internet, then this camera is more than satisfactory. On the other hand, if you plan to print your images, or have them printed, you can use this camera on the highest resolution setting and get decent quality prints (with a good printer, of course). Prints larger than 5x7&quot; should be left to a higher end camera.

Pitfalls of this model include: Low battery life. Use rechargables! Substantial delay between the time you press the shutter release and the time the photo is taken. You can miss the moment easily. Lens is set to the left of the camera body and it's easy to get your fingers in the way. Long recharge rate between flash photos. Loses date/time settings each time batteries are removed. Compact flash card is difficult to remove. No tool is supplied, but one would be appreciated.

I knew about all these cons when I bought this camera, and I'm still pretty satisfied with it.<br><br>
