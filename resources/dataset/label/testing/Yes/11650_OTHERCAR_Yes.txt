            Previously, I reviewed my last car, the 1993 Ford Mustang LX. If you read it, you obviously saw how miserable this car made me. In my quest to find the perfect car, I set out looking for a car that would satisfy my needs. Safety was the top priority as three classmates have been killed in the past five years due to car accidents. My neighbor having purchased a 1992 BMW 535i, let me drive it to the prom during my junior year. That one night of driving a BMW led me to purchase and ultimately love the Ultimate Driving Machine.

==Purchase==

I traded in the Mustang for a 1994 BMW 530i with 126,000 miles. The dealer was asking $11,000, however I was able to work out a deal. 

==Driving==
They dont call this the Ultimate Driving Machine for nothing. Driving this car is a joy in itself. It can turn your worst day into an unmeasurable life-changing experience. When you drive this car you will be one with the road. Complete serenity surrounds you and the hum of the engine sends the driver into a euphoric state of bliss. For some, the meaning of life will be found while driving this car. Others will find that life suddenly has meaning, it just took a BMW to find what it is.

==Performance==

The 32v 215 horsepower V8 engine propels the automatic 530i from 0-60 in 7.5 seconds. A truly remarkable feat that leaves other drivers on the road bewildered.  

==Handling==

The car is a magnet and the road is a piece of metal. When you accelerate, an invisible hand comes down and pushes the car as you steer. With this, you are not on the road, you are a part of it. The near perfect 50/50 balance also contributes to the cars world-class handling.  In emergency handling manuvers, the car handles almost intuitively. With the optional traction control system, your handling and control improves in bad weather. 

==Safety==

Many have tried and few have come close to matching the superior safety that BMW provides to its occupants. To impart a feeling of security when driving or riding in this luxury/performance sedan BMW has incorporated much of the latest technology in safety for its occupants. Among the many items are dual front airbags, automatic front seatbelt tensioners, anti-lock brakes, an impact sensor that automatically unlocks doors and turns on lights and hazard flasher after and accident and a driveaway protection device that, when engaged, disables the engine. 

==Overall==

For the price I paid, I couldn't have found a better car, sadly however, a recent storm caused the roads to flood with water. I was driving when this happened and blew the engine. This was the end for my BMW, and the expensive repairs drove me to purchase a newer vehicle with a warrenty. Until I can fully afford everything about a BMW, it wouldn't be right to own one. Anyone who does however should be thankful they do.
