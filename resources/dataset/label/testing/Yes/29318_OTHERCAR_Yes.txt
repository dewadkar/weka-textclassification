            In June of 1999 I was in the market for a new vehicle.

Before I laid eyes on the black 2 door convertible 4x4 1999 Chevy Tracker, I was opting for a 1999 Z24 convertible. The test drive in the tracker changed my mind.

Although it lacks the power of the Z24, the ride is a lot smoother than I would expect from a utility vehicle. Visibility is great once you get used to the small side windows. 

The option package I bought included air conditioning, 2.0 liter engine with 120 horsepower, four wheel drive, the coolest wheels and much more. 

This vehicle is best for warmer climates as far as the convertible goes but handles awesome during the snowy or rainy times. The interior controls and accessories are all comfortably within reach. There are even separate cup holders and small compartments on the sides of the back seat for passengers. 

On the down side, it's slightly uncomfortable getting in and out of the back seat and there isn't much trunk space unless you fold down the rear seat. In which case, you'd be compromising passenger room. 

One of my biggest concerns with purchasing a convertible that you manually take off the top was whether I could do it alone or not. The salesman recommended this as a two man job, but I have since proved him quite wrong. In less than 4 minutes I have the top completely down, back up in less than 7. 

Back in 1993 I was considering the purchase of the Geo Tracker. It back then disappointed me. They've since improved quite a bit with a smoother ride and less wind noise. I'm very proud of my decision!<br><br>
