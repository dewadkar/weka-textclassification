            One of my fondest memories of the car business will no doubt be selling my son and his wife their first new car. (I had just joined the staff of the largest Chevrolet dealership in town, and on my second day on the floor, I walked in and there they were.) 

&quot;We want a Cavalier,&quot; I was told. Finding one that fit their budget and still gave them good features was easy; Cavalier IS the perfect starter car for that very reason.

They opted for a black two-door with an automatic transmission. GMAC worked with us and we secured a loan for them at a fair interest rate for a young couple with limited (but GOOD) credit.

I have driven many 1999 Cavaliers, and their's was a solid as any. The car was a four cylinder, but was surprisingly responsive and handled nicely. The tranny shifted smooth and the sound system, a simple AM-FM Stero, was of a decent quality. 

The car has handled the rigors of average driving, they've put roughly 20,000 miles on it with no repairs required. It still looks and runs like new, although the tires do show a bit of wear.

One &quot;oddity&quot; that happens occasionally with GM cars; the &quot;1-800 number sticker for their roadside assistance plan was that of a Pontiac Sunfire.)

They purchased their Cavalier in November of 1998. Now it's April of 2000 and they're still very pleased with their car and I'm happy that I was able to put them together with it.
