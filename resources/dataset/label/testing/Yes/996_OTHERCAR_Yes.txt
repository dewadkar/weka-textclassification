            The brand new for 2003 Toyota Matrix is a hard vehicle to catagorize.  Is it a stationwagon? A compact sports sedan? A minivan?  The Matrix is actually a little bit of all those vehicles and more.


EXTERIOR
The look of the Matrix is somewhat appealing, depending on the angle you look at.  The front end is similar looking to the new Corolla and the look is quite nice with the rounded headlights and large grill.  The rest of the vehicle as a nice shape to it, but the back end is a little too minivan looking.  However, the optional 16 inch alloy wheels upgrade the appearence quite nicely.  

INTERIOR
The interior is traditional Toyota quality.  Nicely laid out with all controls within arms reach.  The gauges are very similar to the Celica's orange colored display.  The interior is also very upscale looking with carbon fiber trim all around.  I drove the manual transmission version and the shifter is dash mounted instead of the traditional floor mounted design of most cars.  It took some getting used too, but the system works fine and also frees up some floor space between the front seats.  Speaking of seats, I was very comfortable in both the front and back seats.  This car is very spacious inside for being a compact.  Tons of head and leg room in both front and back seats.  The Matrix is unique because of all the configurations that are possible with this car.  The front passenger seat can be folded down to create more room.  The rear seats can be configured to make a totally flat floor thats creates a large amount of cargo room.  

ENGINE/DRIVE
The Matrix has 2 engines/drivetrains that are shared with Toyota's Celica.  Both are 1.8, 4cyl. w/ 130, and 180 horsepower respectively.  The Matrix also offers an all-wheel drive system which can only be exclusively paired with the 130hp engine.  The Matrix I drove was a manual tranny, powered by the 130hp base engine.  The car had decent pickup, but is no hot rod.  It could use some more low end power.  However, power is adequate for most driving situations.  Gas mileage is outstanding, at around 30 for city and 35 for highway.  

PRICE/VALUE
The Matrix starts around 14500 for a base model, and stickers for around 22500 for a fully loaded model w/ the more powerfull engine.  I consider it a great value considering the versatility of this vehicle.  Its created in the niche of the wildly popular PT Cruiser from last year.  That car won Motor Trends car of the year and the Matrix could very well do the same.  Like I said, the car is versatile and could fill a variety of needs for many people.  I expect it to be a strong seller for Toyota.
