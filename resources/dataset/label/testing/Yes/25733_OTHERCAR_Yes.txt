            When I first heard that Volkswagen was remaking the &quot;Bug&quot;, I had my heart set on purchasing one before they hit the dealers.  I thought that the price of it would be way out of my league, but to my suprise it wasn't.  I found out that they can be purchased for about $17,000.00.  After my friend bought hers I felt compelled to purchase one of my own, so I decided to research all the features, and different models of them.  I found that the GLS model was the most practical, and affordable for me.  

This car is the coolest thing to come back to life.  The cute little flower holder adds that Flower Power touch.  The safety features are excellent on this car, and the loud car alarm is great so that no one steals your &quot;Love Bug&quot;.  They are easy to keep clean, and quite affordable to own.  You get great gas mileage with these cars too.  The only bad things i found about them, is if you get cream cloth seats, they are easy to stain, and hard to clean.  In the snow they are not the easiest cars to drive.  My car was going up a hill and snow got stuck underneath it, because it is so low, and it overheated the car.  Also, the backseat gets really cramped, however, if you happen to be a tall person (as i am) the front is very comfortable for you.  You will never have to worry about not having enough head room.  It is a classy look brought back to life.  

Driving this vehicle is the joy of my life.  The ride is so smooth.  It's easy to find parking in this vehicle since it is so small it will fit practically anywhere.  It maneuvers easily, and is comfortable to ride in.  There are so many features you can have put into this car to make it as comfortable as home for you.  You can have heated seats, heated mirrors, and heated windshield wiper cleaners for those lousy winter months.  You can get a sunroof, and air conditioning for those hot summer months.  The lights on the inside of the car definitely give it that neon groovy look.  The stereo is so clear, and easy to use.  The entire car is just a great ride.

I think everyone should definitely buy this car!  It is great for people of all ages.  It makes you feel completely awesome.  You will have the best memories of your life riding in this car!  It is so much fun to own, and drive.<br><br>
