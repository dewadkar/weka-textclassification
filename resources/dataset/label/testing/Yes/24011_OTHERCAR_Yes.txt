            I bought my 92' accord from a family friend, and it had 162,500 miles on it.  Wow, you say that's alot of miles!  Yes but it runs like its brand new!  Its is a 5spd, my first, and I have given it some grinding and burning, yet it still purrs like a kitten.  The car has some added Horse power from the intake and exhaust (about 15hp), which really helps the power of the engine.  Gas mileage is off the hook- I get 350-400miles to a tank of unleaded gas.  Like I said, if you purchase an LX or DX it is only going to have 125hp.  That is really whimpy for a four door sedan.  I'd recommend atleast an air intake, to increase the hp.  Trust me, you feel the difference.  THe ride is smooth, the custom short-shifter shifts fast (even though Im still learning)  The clutch is really easy to operate, stock or not, Its elementary  to learn.  You cannot beat the reliability of this vehicle.  My car has had theses repairs: (within the last 5k miles) New radiatior (plastic stock one cracked at about 158k), New timing belt (Recommended every 100k miles), New racing Clutch, brakes, and thats it.  theses are the only repairs for this car besides oil changes every 3k, and fluid checks.  this car burn no oil at all.  This car is an excellent quality.  THe interior is immaculate, no wear an tear on the seats at all, nice CD player, AC blows artic chills down my back, Heater bursts with hot air, on cold days.  Bottom line- if the car is in good condition, especially if it is someone you know, but it.  Anything under 2ook miles will last you for at least a couple years.. at least I'm expecting 350k out of my car at least.
