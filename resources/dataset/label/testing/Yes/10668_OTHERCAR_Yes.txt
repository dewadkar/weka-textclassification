            I purchased the Geo Storm 3 years ago.  Since then, aside from oil changes and whatnot, I have put $156 into repairs for this car.  I am absolutely AMAZED at how WELL this car runs, and keeps running.

Of course in every line of cars, there will always be a bummer or two - thus the negative results in this catergory.  It is important to realize that somtimes things just don't go well in a car, but typically this is restricted to A CAR not A LINE OF CARS.

When selecting this car, I did not take it to a mechanic.  I know cars pretty well, adn I am comfortable making these kinds of decisions.  For those of you who are spited because your mechanic said it was somthing it wasnt, BLAME THE MECHANIC not the car.  my advise:  know what you are looking for/at when purchasing a car.  It will save you thousands.

The storm gets about 35-40 mpg.  It is a fabuleous student car, a great commuter.  It is quiet, small, and goes there and back.  What more can you ask for for $3000????

My only complaint with this car is the placement of the muffler.  It is positioned so that the water from a wet road splashes right up on it, and they corrode very quickly.  I am due a replacement, my first in 3 years.  But living in Portland Oregon, I feel that is a pretty good lifespan given this poor of a design.

Overall - just know your car.  Typically a geo is a sound system - We own two of them.  Learn what to listen for when buying a used car so you don't get spited, but choose geo with confidence.

I should also mention that the geo is very roomy.  I am 6'4", and I fit fine.  There is no room in the back seat, but hey - that is just storage space for me anyway!
