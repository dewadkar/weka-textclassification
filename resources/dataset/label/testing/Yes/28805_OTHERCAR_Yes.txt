            I bought my 1998 Chevy Lumina in 1999 for $13,000.  I was expecting a child and needed a four door vehicle.  I was impressed with the options that I got on the car for the price.  I have been very satisfied with both the appearance and overall performance of the car.  It is a V6 and has very good take off power.  The gas mileage is not that great but I would think it is about average for a V6.  I have to have a lot of room for my family and I have found that this car accommodates us fairly adequately.  I would recommend anyone who is just starting a family to buy this car.  It is a very nice car that is affordable to most families. <br><br>
