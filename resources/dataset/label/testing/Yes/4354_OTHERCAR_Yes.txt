            Let's be honest:  I'm crazy about my Mercurys.  When I was 17, my first car was a 1978 Monarch: used, beat up, leaking every conceivable fluid, and wonderful.  When I graduated college, it was a 1988 Topaz:  cute, easy to drive, and the perfect little car.  

Two years ago, it was time to replace the Topaz.  Naturally, the choice was a 1998 Mystique.  As with its predecessors, I fell instantly in love.

The Mystique is a wonderful car for a professional woman.  Sleek and stylish, it succeeds in being both sporty and business-like.  My car handles well, gets good gas mileage (25 mpg on very short trips), and runs quietly.

My only complaint is with the number of recalls.  In the period of time that I have owned the car, I have experienced five recalls that range from minor to moderate in seriousness.  While Mercury is to be highly commended for their efficient notification and ease of obtaining service, I can't help but think that relocating some manufacturing to Mexico was not their best decision.  Hopefully, any problems Mexican manufacturing plants has since been ironed out.

However, it is overall a fine car.  I can't wait to see the Mercury line for 2008, when I will be due to drive away with a new one.<br><br>
