            I used to think the newer cavaliers were just absolutely ugly!!  BLAH!!  Until my old 1989 Cavalier decided to go kapoot...  I didnt know what I wanted to get but I knew I wasnt going to buy another used vehicle to dump more and more money into.  My 1989 Cavalier I had for about 4 yrs and never really put that much money into it that I can remember until the motor went.  We knew it was going to go but were just hoping for it to last a little bit longer at least until tax season rolled around.  Well here comes January, only one month left to go before we would get our taxes back... needless to say, we didnt make it that far.

Off to the dealerships we went.  We put up the money to put a used motor into the car and went looking for a new car to trade it in for.  At the end of January we finally decided on what we wanted after looking at several car dealerships.  We looked at pontiacs and chevrolets and decided on the 1999 Cavalier.  The dealer was absolutely wonderful with us.  The only question I had for him that he couldnt answer was &quot;are these windshield wipers 2 different sizes?&quot;  It was just a funny to throw him off guard.  After a little over a year of owning  this vehicle it has been absolutely great with only a few flaws found.  It has a rough idle that we were told it was going to have with that type of motor that it had.  It is a 4 speed automatic 2.2 engine.  There is also a problem with the fuel guage.  You can fill it up and it will show full but after you turn the engine off and start it back up the guage shows only 3/4 full.  They replaced the fuel pump and the sender to see if that would fix it but it didnt.  The only other option was to tear into the dash board but We really didnt want them to do that so we decided to just live with it.  So far it has only had 1 recall and that was for a radiator hose that would lay on the battery tray causing the vehicle to leak anti~freeze and possibly overheat.  Needless to say it never overheated on us before that.  Then after a year the cd player went out but that was our fault because of the wonderful spot they have the cup holder at right in front of the stereo.  I get aproximately 320 to 350 miles to the tank full of gas, which is not all that bad in my opinion.

Other than that this is an excellent vehicle to own and we would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a compact vehicle to own.  Only other thing I have to say is, make sure you get one with a spoiler on it.   Them trunks just look too odd with the rounded shape.<br><br>
