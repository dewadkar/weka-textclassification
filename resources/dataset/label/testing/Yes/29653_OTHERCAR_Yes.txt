            Gotta love this car... because it's MY car!

I picked up a green '96 GSR coupe two years ago, and I must say that I have little to no complaints.  It's a sweet ride -- great on the gas mileage, has a nice sporty look to it, and hauls booty on the freeway.  Of course, you want to get standard shift, or a lot of the driving enjoyment is thrown right out the proverbial window.

My only complaint with this car is the fact that I am a poor, poor young man with no means to fix it up.  There are a few dents and dings on it that I wish I could have repaired, but I don't want to let some half-baked body shop put their hands on my baby.  (I've taken it to a body shop recommended by my insurance company once -- BIG MISTAKE!)  Regardless, despite a few cosmetic flaws, the car hasn't required any serious investment on my part, aside from the obligatory oil changes, tire rotations and tire replacement.  (On a side note -- you don't necessary have to stick with the V-rated Michelins that the car comes with.  They're wicked tires, but at $175 a pop, there are other economical options out there.  Believe me, I've made the mistake to replace them before and I'm still paying them off on credit!)

Back to the car... it comes with a nice sound system, has ultra-comfortable front bucket seats, and despite it's size (it is roughly the same size of a Mitsubishi Eclipse) the Integra has about 8-12 inches of extra legroom in the back compared to it's competition.  

A truly wonderful first car for younger drivers that they might not want to get rid of for years.  These puppies keep on chugging forever, as long as you maintain 'em.
