            I was checking out our local used car lots for something that would please me; low cost, easy handling, good on gas. It also had to please my husband, a big man with a love of trucks and 'guts'. 

He was looking at another SUV when I saw the Sportage and I loved it's body. We almost didn't test drive it because it is only a 4 cylinder and we have mountains around here. When we tried it out we found it had plenty of giddy-up-and-go. It has a really tight turning radius and is a dream to drive. We've used the 4WD high and low, it is easy to get into and out of as well as being easy to handle. 

The surprising thing is that for a smallish foreign car there is plenty of leg and head room for my husband, who as I mentioned earlier is a Big man. 

I LOVE our Kia. After a year of ownership there is only one thing I dislike - my spare tire is in the cargo area and it is not sunken and this takes up too much space. The later models have the tire mounted on the outside.<br><br>
