            I've had my 2020 for quite some time now, and taken probably 1000+ shots. I'm very happy with it! It was expensive (much more than a film camera would be) but I love the "instant" nature of digital, especially being able to delete really lame shots immediately and re-take them. I am a kind of lousy photographer, but I like taking pictures!

I have been very impressed with this camera's overall quality of pictures, no matter what the situation it seems to at least get an OK shot (whereas I'm certain a film camera would just give me a blank picture). In the dark, taking pictures of San Francisco's city lights from the top of a hill for example, it did a great job (on a tripod). In bright light it captures the shot nicely. You don't have to learn much to get great results.
I've never tried the software that came with the camera, I've got other tools for image manipulation, etc. 
I've uploaded pictures from this camera to ofoto.com and shutterfly.com and got EXCELLENT prints back, even 8x10s!
Plus, this camera has features for miles, including full-manual mode which is really cool for experimenting with and getting "artsy" effects. At the time I bought this no other consumer-level, sub-$1000 digital camera had this level of manual control. 

Absolute MUST-buy items for this camera (probably all other digital cameras as well!):
1. A good padded camera bag. This baby's expensive, don't break it.
2. More memory (I got 2 32M cards online cheap, that plus the 8 it came with give me about 140 shots before I have to download at 1600x1200 resolution). 
3. A standalone memory card reader. USB smartmedia readers are about $40. Well worth it! Makes transferring images a snap.
4. An extra set of batteries. About $15, and well worth it when you're in the middle of someplace and your first set dies.

Cons: a lot of people complain about the lens cap. I don't care, I just keep it in the camera case when not in use. Also, the "movie" feature is kind of silly (no sound, fair quality) and hey, I've got a camcorder if that's what I wanted to do, and the shape is a bit too large to fit into a pocket. One other thing, the JPEGs it creates by default are *huge*--recompressing them with another tool even at high quality reduces them in size typically 50-75% (good to know if you have to upload them to someone or attach them to emails). I'm also a little worried that SmartMedia will not be the de facto standard soon for memory cards; looks like Compact Flash is making more progress, and MMC is promising as well. Oh, also the menu system is a bit convoluted, you have to learn where certain things are, and some settings get reset whenever you turn off the camera, which can be annoying.

I can't wait to see what $750 will buy you in a digital camera in a few years, when I replace this one. I'm very happy for now, and expect to take lots more photos with it. A very good investment!
