            My mom recently bought a 2001 Chevy Venture LT, and we drove it from New England down to Florida, and will be driving back up soon.  After spending so much time in the car, I think I have a pretty good view on it.  

First to address some issues I saw mentioned in other reviews.  Yes there is a trip odometer.  Press the button that says reset next to the normal odometer.  Just press, do not hold.  You then will see the trip odometer.  I believe it actually has 2 seperate ones.  Press the button to switch between them and the regular odometer, and hold the button to clear the trip odometer. (Its the new GM thing)

Someone else mentioned its hard to remove the seats.  Im not sure which seats she was referring to, but I can remove the ones in the middle row, the 3 seperate seats very very easily.  I can do it in under 30 seconds each, without help.  They are quite light, especially compared to the old Villager.  That took 2 people, and a good 10 minutes or more.

upsides:
This is a quick van, definetely more powerful than the van my mom used to have, a 93' Villager.  Even with the van packed with luggage, and 5 people, I was easily cruisin at 85mph down I95, even up hills.

The power sliding door is a nice feature, maybe a little unneccessary, but nonetheless nice.  You have control of it through the remote for unlocking doors, through pulling on the handle, or pressing a button on the ceiling in the front, or by pressing a button next to the door.

There is also a button up front to control popping open the very rear windows. The middle ones are still manually operated, but the back ones are power.  This feature is nice when you are alone in the car, or no one is sitting in the very back and you want those windows opened.  

There is also a rear window wiper, which is nice.  I always thought these were dumb, but I saw how nice they truelly are.  It was in the final leg of the I95 cruise to Florida, and the sky opened up in typical Florida fasion.  I had the front wipers on hi, defrosters on, and I couldnt see out the back at all, so I asked my dad to turn on the rear wipers because I was very focussed on driving seeing as how the traffic and rain were both heavy and the button is unfortunately in a dumb spot (My cup in the cup holder was blocking me from reaching it) 

Also nice are little storage units next to the back row seats.  Its kind of like a center console, but on the side in the rear for the kids to put things in.

downsides:
There are no middle row cup holders.  This sounds like a dumb complaint, but when you have a car capable of holding 8 passengers, and there are only 4 cupholds, the design seems dumber than the complaint.

Another odd one is that there are plugs to insert headphones.  Its nice, you can listen to the CD in the stereo on your headphones while the others listen to the Radio or tape.  But, as soon as you turn on the headphones, it deactivates the rear speakers..so actually only the front 2 passengers can really hear whats on the speakers.  You would think there would be a seperate button to turn the speakers on or off, but there isnt.  The button to turn headphones on turns speakers off, and vice versa.

As with most non-luxury cars, it has its little issues with Quality, such as trim on the outside being kind of beat up when we went to pick up the car, and some of the interior material on the door has too big of a gap from the window (Both of which were taken care of later).  The wierdest however is that the windshield wipers were messed up, and when we went to use them, they actually went off the windshield, hit the trim, and stuck out from the side of the car on ever pass they made.  This was later adjusted by the dealer.  I suggest everyone tries their windshield wipers when picking up this car.

To sum it all up, I love this new minivan, and its long list of big positive features outweigh the little annoyances I have nitpicked here.  I would suggest this as a great van to anyone in the market for a minivan.  Make sure you still do your research, and check it out yourself, everyone has different tastes.  Also know that this car is the twin of the Oldsmobile Silhoutte and the Pontiac Montana.  So if you like this car in general, but have little problems with minor details of it, check out those other two, becuase they have the exact same base.  The only difference would be some of the interior layout, and the trim.

I will continue to update this review as I find good and bad things out about this car.
