            At 21 I really didn't want a &quot;mini-van&quot; but when we stumbled across our beautiful used Ford Aerostar (Sport Edition) I knew it was the right car for us. As new parents our focus was on safety and stability, as a band member my husband was also thinking about room. The middle and back seat come out relatively easy, and leave enough room for his bands' equipment. The aerostar is a sturdy minivan. It's nice looking and has a great sound system to boot.

If there is something I do not like about the aerostar it is the fact that (at least ours) is rear wheel drive. Unless weighed down during winter don't expect to get anywhere. However, with 3 bags of sand in back we did very well last winter. I like how high I am in our van compared to driving in a car. I also like the smooth ride, our cd player hardly ever skips. I am not afraid of tipping the aerostar as I would an suv. When you ride around it just feels sturdy.

I think that anyone could buy this van and enjoy it. The sport model is not too big and not too small. For us it is just right, and we are getting our money's worth out of it.<br><br>
