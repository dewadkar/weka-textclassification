               We needed a roomy car for a family of - then - 3 and capable of getting us to the snow: we ski a lot in the winter.  The only choice was a Subaru Legacy, and we decided to go with the Outback: it sits a little higher than the regular Legacy.  We ended up buying a 5-speed station wagon.
   During our first trip on the snow, I hit an ice patch, and the car went into a skid: even all wheel drive does not prevent physics from working!  As soon as I lowered the gear to add rpm to the motor, it immediately caught the pavement and straightened out.
   It is comfortable in the front and in the rear, although dashboard design could have been better - they have improved it on the 2000 model;  fairly economical (~23 mpg in the streets); safe.
   It is not a car you would want to drive like a Porsche, but it is a steady and dependable workhorse.  The weight to power (or torque) ratio is not great, but it's OK to get the RPM up into the 5,000's, and then it flies.  I had no problems going 65++++ up highway 80 in California in 3rd or 4th gear, which it did not seem to have a problem with.<br><br>
