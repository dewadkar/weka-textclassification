            This is a great-driving vehicle.  Smooth, powerful and tight, my 1998 F150 4x4 off-road package Lariat SuperCab has, overall, been a great lease ride.  The leather interior of the Lariat is sharp and wears like iron. Controls are well-placed and easy to operate, except for the 5 disc CD cassette changer which is a pain in the neck to access. I drive well over 2500 miles/month and the vehicle has always been a pleasure, well worth the $525/month lease payment (nothing down on delivery with an additional 30,000 miles built into the 2 year red carpet lease mileage allowance of 15,000 miles/year). Mine is loaded with everything but a moon roof.

Which is not to say that the truck has been perfect.  At about 40,000 miles the V-8 engine began pinging, which annoyance was eliminated with switching from 89 octane to 91.  The air conditioning lost most of its punch halfway through its second summer, and Michigan isn't exactly a taxing desert climate.  The driver's side power window began grinding to
a halt at around 25,000 miles and the dealer claimed to be unable to find anything wrong. Hmmmm...works fine when it rains or snows, though. And the paint is anything but durable, especially for a vehicle with off-road application. If I had bought the vehicle instead of leasing it I guess problems such as these would tick me off quite a bit, especially considering how early in the truck's life they appeared.

Still, the way I see it, leasing a vehicle is a license to drive the hell out of it and then turn it in just as major upkeep/repair events are about to appear on the horizon, and that's just what I did with this truck.  Other than basic maintenance I just ignore the relatively minor negatives--if the dealer doesn't care then neither do I, and I sure as hell am not about to pay for engine diagnostics/repair on a lease! I have not abused the truck in the least, but I think I have sucked a lot of the life out of it with 65,000+ miles in less than 2 1/2 years and I'm glad I don't have to worry about another 3 years of payments on such a vehicle or trying to unload it with all those miles.

I'm turning it in within the next few weeks with over 65,000 miles on it and picking up a 2001 F150 XLT SuperCab with all of the same features of the Lariat, minus the leather interior, of course, which I don't really care about one way or the other on a lease.    <br><br>
