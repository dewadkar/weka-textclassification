            I purchased my 1991 Chevy Corsica 6 cylinder directly from the dealer.  I did intensive research and felt the car fit my needs, comfort, and the necessary speed to get onto the highway.  

It still drives just like it did off the lot even with 171,000 miles and it's still going strong.  It's a love/hate relationship - when it runs I love it and when it doesn't I'm not too happy.  All in all, I just love my car.  My key is to keep up to the maintenance schedule like clock-work.  I change the oil every 3,000 miles. Luckily I have a 60 mile round-trip highway commute and all my miles are highway - less stress on the car as opposed to city stop/go traffic which may be somewhat straining.  

I did have transmission problems twice (once under warranty -- screw for reverse was not placed on correctly) and the later @ about 150,000.  It was definitely well worth the money over-all though.  I also had a coolant problem that wasn't resolved for 3 years.  The dealer replaced hoses, fan and the next day the antifreeze was everywhere -- they finally replaced the coolant pump their cost, but every summer for 3 years I over-heated. A friend suggested the radiator -- it was running @ 30% capacity (the dealer didn't even look which was a bit discouraging).  That was year ago and since it was replaced haven't had any problems, but normal wear and tear.  I was very fortunate with the exhaust system - factory installed muffler system was replaced @ 139,000 miles.  

All and all I'm very happy with my 91 Corsica, minimum problems and it's still cheaper to fix than buying a new car.   I'm hoping to get at least 200,000+ without minimum repair and I'm somewhat confident, it will last a few year's longer.  <br><br>
