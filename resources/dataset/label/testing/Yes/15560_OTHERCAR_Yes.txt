            Heck, I'm not even a parent. But as someone responsible for transporting groups of rowdy adults... from airport to hotel, from hotel to museums, from hotel to other hot spots, I need something that holds at least 7 people (and their luggage or other gear) comfortably. I settled on the Chevrolet Astro.

My van was a 1999 model year. It had the max package: chrome styled steel wheels, power door locks and windows with remote keyless entry, cruise control, overhead roof console with electronics, power mirrors, tilt steering, tinted glass, AM/FM CD stereo, and air.

It could have seated 8, but both rear seats would have been rather crowded if the passengers were all significantly-sized adults like me. It would be most comfortable with 6 passengers, but can hold 8 in a pinch.

One very slick little feature is the split rear door to the van. The window pops up and the rear portion opens in halves to the side, rather than in one whole unit down. This is very handy for loading and unloading groceries, luggage, sporting gear, etc.

The rear (and middle) seat can also be removed for additional storage space. So taking camping gear for 4 adults, the four adults who will be camping, and all four people's dogs is possible. That's an important trait in any vehicle in my world and our sedan sure wouldn't fit the bill on that issue.

The front seats are high-backed captain's chairs and recline. They even have lumbar support to help ease the strain of long drives. The armrests move up out of the way too.

There are two covered power outlets in the front console and another one in the rear. For those who travel with children who need a place to plug in their GameBoy... or with someone who is working on a laptop, this is wonderful. You can also recharge a Coleman electric lantern in the power outlets.

The Astro has a rear heating and air unit that makes the whole van easier to warm or cool, and the temperature isn't just comfortable for the driver and front seat passenger.

The overhead console has a compass, outside temperature gage, map lights, and storage compartments... one of which can hold a garage door opener. The center console on the floor hosts a giant glove box and two cup holders.

The spare tire storage is under the vehicle. This is great in some ways because it means the tire isn't taking up precious cargo room inside the van. It's a bummer, however, if you're having to change a tire in nasty weather and need to crack ice to get your spare out. The tire does sit on a crank-down winch, so if it's not frozen it's fairly easy to get out.

The Astro is standard with a V6 engine that boasts 190-hp... enough to haul a boat or camper. The gas tank holds a whopping 25 gallons. That allows for a great driving range but busts up a good credit card when gas prices edge up.

The Astro also has a tow/haul switch that helps when the vehicle is pulling a trailer or hauling heavy loads. In essence, it lengthens the transmission shift timing and is supposed to help reduce throttle pedal activity. My experience shows that in most cases, you don't need the switch, but I can imagine it would come in handy if I was dragging a large boat behind me.

Gas mileage is pretty good for a tough minivan... 15/19 mpg.

All in all, I had no problems with the Astro and found it to be a pretty good ride. Strong winds tend to rock it a bit, since it's a high profile vehicle, but I don't know any minivan that isn't prone to wind jiggle. It could have slightly better suspension... the rear seats get to be a bit like an amusement park ride on bumpy roads, though the front and middle seats are still pretty stable. If you don't mind admitting to owning a Chevy, the Astro is a fine vehicle and less expensive than some other makes and models out there.<br><br>
