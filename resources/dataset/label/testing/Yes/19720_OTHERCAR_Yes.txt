            I bought this little camera as an investment so I could post pictures of my items on an auction site. I have grown to use it much more than I ever thought I would.

I won't bore you with the same things everyone else has said about the short battery life and the small Memory stick. Just plan on spending extra money on the Sony Infolithium battery and more storage capacity and it'll all be good. While I'm on the subject of the battery, though, note that the charger itself plugs into the camera. You don't remove the battery and put it into a charger. So there are lots of cords lying around versus one clean charger unit. This is just a minor detail in the overall picture, though. I would recommend economizing on charger and memory by watching your favorite auction site, since these are readily available commodities. No need to pay full retail, IMHO.

The camera itself is so full featured that it has taken me months of constant use to learn it well. To me it was more time consuming to learn than my manual SLR. The icons on the LCD screen can be confusing when certain features are enabled. But overall I am satisfied with the picture quality for the money. However, I still have trouble with getting colors to portray accurately both inside and outside, and I'm not sure why, as I have tried all sorts of settings to tweak it. The sepia tone and black and white and other settings are fun to play with. 

The camera has been a bit of a challenge to learn, but a lot of fun. The movies are a cool feature. Despite its shortcomings detailed above, I still love the size and basic functionality and have used it more than I had planned.
