            I owned a '98 Wrangler Sahara until I just couldn't take it anymore � now I miss it.  It was some sort of love-hate relationship.     

At speeds under 45 mph, the Jeep is a nice ride with the top up or down.  At highway speeds however, the Jeep is punishing and approaches inhumane.  As the speedometer approaches 60 or 70 mph, the unaerodynamic soft top begins to roar at somewhere near the threshold of pain.  The top, sides, and back of the soft top all flap together to create an incredibly loud noise.  The soft top noise on the Jeep is like nothing you could imagine if you had only driven smaller, sleeker convertible cars.  With the top down on the Jeep, you lose the soft top noise, but you hear more road and wind noise � again, not comparable to a convertible car.  I preferred the top down � to me that was the lesser of the evils.  On a long trip however, I would wish I was driving something different.  After 9 hours straight in that thing, my ears would beg for mercy.    

I primarily drove the Jeep to work and to run errands around town � for this, the Jeep is great.  I loved driving it with the top down at lower speeds.  With the in-line 6, the Jeep has a very nice horsepower to weight ratio.  The Jeep will get up and accelerate pretty good until about 60 mph when the aerodynamic penalties start to kick in.  The Jeep is also very maneuverable and is very easy to parallel park.  With the top down it has great road visibility in all directions.  With the top up it has a few small blind spots.

I only had one serious mechanical problem with the Jeep. Right at 36k miles the rear differential started to go out.  It was just out of warranty, but Chrysler still paid for most of it.  I also had a fairly minor problem with a short or something in the turn signal handle.

I've had the Jeep in ice and snow and thought it handled ok.  I only had the Jeep off road once, and I got it high centered in a creek � I guess I should have bought a winch first.

My Jeep had the Add-A-Trunk option which allows for lockable storage behind the rear seat.  The storage is accessible through the tailgate.  This doesn't give you a lot of room, but you can lock up a pair of shoes, a coat, and a couple other small items.  Don't think you can fit the family groceries back there though.  I also had the tonneau cover which covered the entire bed area behind the front seats.  It offered some additional hidden storage but wasn't really secure.  I bought a tall air compressor once though and was able to take advantage of the Jeep's unlimited vertical storage feature.  I tied it in between the roll bars and drove off - it fit just right. 

I kept the Jeep for about 2-1/2 years and put 38k miles on it.  I traded it after a long 9 hour trip when I decided I was just getting too old to suffer through a ride like that again.  Much to my surprise, the Jeep had depreciated very little and was still worth around $17k.  I had been employed by a branch of Chrysler and only had to pay $19k for it instead of the $22k-23k on the sticker and came out pretty good.                         
   
As long as someone is looking for a second car and has another car they can take on trips, the Jeep is a fine choice and will be enjoyed.  If however, someone is looking for a primary vehicle or the Jeep will be their only car, I think they would be happier with something different.
