            I got my first Digital Camera yesterday!  About time, huh?  Instead of settling for a cheapie low-res camera, I decided on a mid-range one that would work GREAT for web photos, and OK for personal images to save/print.

The impetus to buy came when I was configuring a new Dell computer and it offered a discount AND rebate, bring the purchase price sub $100.  Even at the original price around $175, this is a great deal.

The quick-start sheet had me taking photos and uploading them to my new computer (which I set-up 10 minutes before) within minutes!  The manual pointed out some of the more esoteric features (digital zoom, tile view, flash settings, photo preview on LCD).  The camera walks you through set-up when first powered on.

It's a bit slow when saving to the CompactFlash (8MB included).  I am planning on buying a larger memory card (64MB?).  Hopefully, it won't get even slower.  The wait limits how fast the next photo could be taken.  Also, the auto-focus requires that you hold the shutter button down half-way until it's done, prior to snapping the photo, and needs more than an average amount of ambient light.  This seems to take a bit longer than expected.  Snapping the picture without waiting showed no degradation in the photos.

The flash even has a red-eye reduction mode!  Nice option.

Uploading images was as easy as plugging the camera's USB cable in.
