            While this camera isn't a stellar performer in the digital arena, it does boast several features that warrant merit.  For a sub $150.00 camera, you get 1280x960 images at about 70% JPEG compression, the ability to drop in a Compact flash card, and USB support.

Image quality is average at best, however, if your requirements are not for pro quality, and you are simply looking for something to get images to the internet or email - it's more than adequate.

Batteries are consumed quickly, though over 300 images, I have only changed batteries 3 times (2 AA) - without much flash.  Using the flash is slow, and costly in battery terms. 

The point and shoot nature of the camera precludes it from playing with some of the more expensive cameras, but as a point and shoot, this is a digital you could even let your kids play with.

I have upgraded mine and purchased a 16 meg memory card, giving me the capacity for 93 1280x960 images (128 @ 1024x768) or (337 @ 512x382 low res)

The camera rides with me full time, everywhere, and I haven't for a moment regretted the purchase.
