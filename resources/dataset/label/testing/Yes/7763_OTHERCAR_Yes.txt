            It was difficult if not impossible to keep my expectations from running out of control during the interminably long wait for my car. I started the process of buying this car last July and finally took delivery Jan 5, a period of some 6 months. Much of this wait was caused by me changing my mind, first ordering a 330xi, but then changing my mind and ordering a 325 coupe, and then some little, um, "misunderstandings" with my salesmen.

To cut a very long story short, I picked up my car, a relatively "stripped down" 325Ci, in Munich on January 5 of this year, via the BMW "European Delivery" program. I was full of trepidations. Would my 6'5" frame fit inside the 1" lower coupe, even without the sunroof? Would my 230 pound body fit into the sport seats? Would the sport suspension prove to be too harsh for daily driving over sometimes imperfect roads? Would I regret passing on the leather seats? Would I immediately wish I had spent the extra $5000 for the 330?

Although I wish I'd HAD the extra $5000 to spend on the 330, on an absolute basis, the 325Ci has proven to be everything I hoped it would be and my disappointments have been few. To dispense with the negative first, the steering is simply too light at highway speeds. The steering is ultra precise and quick, with NO dead spot or vagueness on center (or anywhere else) but it's so light I find it hard to keep from "darting around" since even minor movements result in a change of direction. I have to really concentrate on keeping my hands relaxed and steady. This is not a showstopper, but is a blemish on an otherwise exceptional automobile. I'm hearing that BMW will be making a running change beginning sometime in March (?) to remedy the problem, and there is some hope this change will be made available to current owners.

OK, now for the good stuff. Everything else. The engine is smoooth, right up to red line. In fact, it's so smooth I have a hard time knowing when to shift by sound alone. The 2.5 liter engine is not as powerful as the 3.0, but it is plenty powerful. Driving through Spain I was able to accelerate strongly in 5th gear up 3% grades.

The 5-speed manual transmission is snick snick snick, 1 through 5, although I have had some problems making smooth starts in 1st and reverse. I'm getting better at it, and I guess that's just the price one pays for such wonderful 2-5 shifts.

The sport seats are comfortable even (or maybe I should say ESPECIALLY) on long trips. For three days running I spent 10 hours a day in the car, and experienced ZERO discomfort, except for a bit of a sweaty back. The real leather seats might be better than the "ette" in this regard, although the problem was certainly not acute. The seats are ultra supportive, and although a bit tight for my 38" waist, I would not trade their exceptional lateral support for a wider space.

The engineering and build quality are simply outstanding. Every detail has been attended to. No rattles or squeaks. And dozens of little "wow that's cool" thoughtful little touches, like the keyless trunk release, steering wheel mounted audio controls, glovebox mounted flashlight, truly useable map lights, and so on. It's hard to put a price on these little features, but they add up.

Other inherently desireable qualities of a BMW are the rear wheel drive, drop-dead good looks, taut and yet supple suspension, near perfect 50/50 weight distribution, stability control, outstanding safety features. I could go on and on.

On an absolute basis, the 325 is an exceptional car. Some call it overpriced, but I say "you get what you pay for", and I feel I got my $30,300 worth.

August 2002 Update:

17,000 on the odometer.

The steering I complained about? BMW replaced the steering rack last year under warranty with a rebuilt (and revalved) unit in response to customer complaints. The result? The steering is now as good as the rest of the car. Not too light, not too heavy, and still laser precise. It's a joy to drive.

The 1-2 shift has gotten a little "notchy" although it might just be my imagination.

The only problem I have had is with the doors. The drivers side latch was replaced under warranty and now the right side isn't closing without a firm heave. I love the long doors, but I hate the long doors, if you know what I mean. They provide superior over-the-shoulder visibility and a huge opening for getting in and out, but they are heavy and they can swing back on you if you are parked on a slope. Maybe they'll start offering the power assist like they have on the new 7 series - that would be sweet.

After 18 months do I wish I'd spent the extra bucks on the 330? Occasionally, although not very often. If I were to replace it with another 3, yes, definitely I'd go for the 330, but then I'd also go for the leather and maybe the Nav system. Why? Because now I know it's a car I'd keep long enough to justify the extra money. What would it take to get me to "upgrade"? How about a 330 with Valvetronic and SMG? A real "poor man's M3"!
