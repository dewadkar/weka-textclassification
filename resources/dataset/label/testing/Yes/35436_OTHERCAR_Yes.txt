            I know this is for a 2003 Mini Cooper, however, there were no changes between the model years, so it should still be relevant from 2002 and the only difference between the Cooper S I drove and the Cooper is the lack of a supercharger (and that you might get a spare tire with the non "S")  So it's the same car with less pep. However, If a moderator feels this should be placed in the 2002 section, feel free.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My friend wanted to buy a mini cooper (not the S model) and asked me to go with him since I know a little about cars.  After he was done test driving a regular cooper, I inquired if I could take the "S" out for a drive.  The dealer asked me if I was ready to buy one, I told him, "maybe" :)

First thing I ask the dealer is if it's ok for me to really drive the car, he responds yes, and my eyes light up :)  So off we go onto the highway and I run it to redline in the first 3 gears.  (noting the lack of acceleration, or the lack of sensation of acceleration) Dealer guy tells me to exit on to this twisty road he just took my friend down (my friend drove a Camry for the last 12 years, and has no idea what it's like to drive a good handling car, so even when the dealer encouraged him to push the car as hard as he could in a turn, it wasn't exactly inspiring)  I on the other hand, faced with the same directions, pushed the car as hard as I could (I do race quite a bit in sanctioned events and consider myself to be an above average driver in regards to car control)  Being the cool dealer type that he is, even after being frightened gives me the same directions on the last right hand sweeper he gave my friend, "put it in 3rd and floor it around the turn"  Well, entering that straight away, I was already towards the top of 3rd and had to shift into 4th :)  My friend tells me that the dealer was white knuckled holding on to the oh S#!t handle for dear life as we carved through the turns.  My friend was also laughing uncontrollably because I just "drove" a brand new cooper S to it's limits with only 200 miles on the clock.

The dealer asks me if I'm ready to trade in my Miata and my response is "not quite, but thanks for the ride"

In my estimation, the car handles reallllllly good!  Even with the crappy run flat tires that the car is stocked with from the factory.  Putting a good set of aftermarket tires on that car would make all the difference in the world :)  Like I said before, the acceleration was a HUGE let down.  I know what all the magazines say about how quick the car is, but I just didn't feel it.  Even when talking to my friend that is a professional test driver for a national magazine, he came back with the same response, that the car felt severly underpowered.  The only thing I can equate this to, is that perhaps since it was a new car, the engine management was holding back some of the power til it had been properly broken in with X amount of miles.  I'll have to test drive one that is more broken in at a later date :)

Oh yea, in that last turn that scared the dealer so much, I had intended to get the tail end to start sliding around, by jumping off and on the throttle mid way through the turn, and the car was just about to let go, when the DSC (dynamic stability control) kicked in and prevented the car from having any fun.  So for what it's worth that DSC thing worked like a charm... just not when I wanted it to (there is a off switch for it, but I forgot to use it)

I was a little dissapointed with the storage capacity also... for a small hatchback, it wasn't able to hold as much stuff as my little CRX even.  I have no problem putting my snowboard or mountain bike in there, but the Mini struggled with just my snowboard.

Ergonomics is excellent, especially when you get used to that big speedometer.  Kinda wish they had put a digital display on the tach, so I wouldn't have to "get used" to looking over for my speed.  Everything is within easy reach, and the radio controls on the back of the steering wheel is the bee's knees :)  The Sport Seats are very comfortable and hold you well in turns, and the seat heaters are very hot very fast... a bit too hot for my taste, but whatever.  My friend complains that the standard radio doesn't have enough "punch" to feel the music, but it's very clear and if you just turn the volume up a bit more, it's very acceptable IMO. (also pushing most of the fade to the front gave it much better seperation)

I really like the sunroof, it's so big!!!  very clever how they have that netting there so you can have sun, w/o the sun burn :)
