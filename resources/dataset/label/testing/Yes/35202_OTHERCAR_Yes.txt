            My husband and I recently bought a Toyota 4Runner because our family was growing and we needed more space and because my parents are living in areas where a 4-wheel drive vehicle provides easier access.

We were looking for a vehicle that would hold a mid-size dog carrier and a large car seat for our new son (we do a lot of highway travel and felt the deluxe Alpha-Omega car seat by Cosco would be safer than the smaller versions.  In addition, we now have a wide variety of baby paraphenalia!

We looked at mini-vans, including Toyota and Honda, and really decided that they did not fit our lifestyle.  We have had the opportunity of driving in a number of SUVs since my husband often uses rentals for business travel and had spent a great deal of time in my parents Eddie Bauer edition Ford Explorer. We found the ride in these vehicles to be extremely truck-like, in fact I though I might deliver at six months riding in the back seat of the Explorer!

We have been long-time Honda owners, but felt the Honda SUVs to be too small.  Our Honda and Toyota dealerships were under one roof and they were willing to give us an excellent deal for our two late model Hondas.  Our son got his first new car!

We love the 4Runner for in town use, although I find the tailgate door a little heavy to pull down.  I can get a ton of groceries in. But the real test came on our first road trip.

The 4 Runner is a great drive - really smooth and not like a truck - (I know because I spent a lot of time in the back seat with our screaming son).  The seats were very comfortable and the rear heater worked great. We did not need the 4Wheel drive, but it was nice to know that we had it available should it snow. But alas, the vehicle is still too small - I suppose we need to get a Landcruiser.

Some things we noticed.  1) We would love to have a tailgate for changing diapers, picnicing, etc.  I think SUV drivers who use the vehicle for sport would want the same thing. 2) The car seat does not fit very well when it is rear facing - it has to go in the middle (it would interfere with front seat movement if it is on one side or the other), which makes loading more difficult since you have to leave one side unloaded for easy access to the baby.  In addition, it makes riding in the back seat difficult for extra passengers - hard to find the seat belt and very little seating space on either side. I would have been comfortable otherwise - the leg room is fine. We would also like to put the dog carrier in the back seat and this will not work (and it would have in our Honda Accords). 3) Gas mileage did not meet expectations only 14-16 miles per gallon as opposed to the 18 mpg stated - but this may be because the vehicle is so new.

We would love to see a luggage rack cover that goes with the car - we needed more storage space!<br><br>
