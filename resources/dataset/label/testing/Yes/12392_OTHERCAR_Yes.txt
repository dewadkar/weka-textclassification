            I bought my jeep in 1997. It was three years old and had relatively low mileage. I loved the idea of having a convertible, but as I had once flipped a station wagon, was a bit leary of conventional convertibles. Since then, I've spent almost no money on repairs. In three years, I've put on close to 70,000 miles, but have only had to repair the windshield wipers, a universal joint and a radiator.

Apparently there was a recall on the 1994 windshield wipes. Because of the angle of the blades, heavy snows sometimes break the motors of the wipers. If buying used jeep, make sure to check out recalls.

I've had mine in the snows of NY and it has almost no rust. 

The radiator in the 1994 is plastic, though, so have it checked regularly. It sucks when it cracks and strands you.

With soft-tops, they last anywhere from 5 to 7 years, then start to fray. The windows also become less clear when they have been removed many times. Then again, that may have come from trying to remove ice from it with a scraper.

In all, I love my jeep and it was one of the best investments I've ever made. <br><br>
