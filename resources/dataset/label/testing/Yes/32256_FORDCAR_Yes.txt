            We purchased the Ford 2001 Windstar LX 4 door Minivan in March of this year.  Our son was born in August of last year and my sporty little Nissan and my husband's small pickup truck weren't exactly family style vehicles.  We decided on the Windstar because of the safety features and all the reviews about this van seemed positive. 

We visited some different dealerships and settled on the LX because it was in our price range and was the middle of the road van in the Windstar line.  

The LX has a 4 speed automatic transmission with a 3.8 litre V6 engine with 200 horsepower.   The van we purchased has both the front and side impact airbags but I think the side airbags are an optional feature so be sure to question the dealership about those.  We felt that was the safest option and would have added them anyway.  

Our van also came equipped with air conditioning, cruise control, full power to windows, mirrors, and locks.  The tires are 15" that are self sealing in case of punctures for added safety.  We did purchase this as part of the Family Security Group and for the additional money we got the self sealing tires and an anti-theft protection system. We replaced the steel wheel covers that came on the van with a set of wheels that my husband purchased locally for a sporty look.

The inside of the van is roomy with plenty of leg room, which was important because my husband is 6'10" and some cars just aren't comfortable.  The front has bucket seats and the entire interior is gray cloth instead of the leather that was available in some models.  The seating is nice and not like an old Caravan I owned, you can move these seats inside.  The exterior is a Spruce Green that is beautiful.  My husband wanted red but we compromised in that area.

The inside of the van will seat a family of six with no trouble and still lots of elbow room. There is the ability to seat 7 passengers.  Riding in the back seats were just as comfortable as riding in the front or in the driver's seat.  My husband complained there wasn't as much leg room in the back and that it wasn't as roomy as in front.  

There's plenty of added lighting inside with the reading lights, dome light, and a sleeping baby mode light.  This van is built for a comfortable ride and the little extras are cup holders, seat pockets, folding seats for hauling, and the stereo system that lets passengers listen to something different through a headset if they don't like the driver's taste.

For safety, this van has a rear sensing system that will tell us when there is something behind the car.  It is still best to check around the van before taking off in case there is a problem with this sensor.  

This van is our family car.  It gets 18 miles to the gallon in city driving and 24 miles to the gallon on highways.  The gas mileage is impressive and important at today's prices.  We drive our van with the security of knowing it is covered by a 36 month or 36,000 mile Powertrain warranty.  

For anyone that needs the technical specifications, I will list those now for you so you have all the information you need.
