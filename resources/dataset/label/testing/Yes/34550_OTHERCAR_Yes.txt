            Nissan came out with the Pathfinder and it was a hit among some car consumers.  I liked it because of its height and lean features.  Now Nissan gives us <b>the Infinity QX4</b>.  The first thing that hits your eyes is its color.  For some reasons, I like looking at the burgundy QX4.  More and more, I have been checking these QX4s. It is going to be time for me to change vehicles. But, looks are not only the attributes and features I am looking at.  I had two chances to do test-drive this SUV.  I want to share with you my findings.

<b>What's hot about this vehicle?</b>

<i>Its control panel is high enough for me</i>

One of my favorite features in a car is whether its interior is tall enough to fit me.  Do I have enough leg space?  This has probably been one of the reasons I like Jeep and some GM SUVs.  I can easily fit my frame into them.  Its controls are well placed.  As I test drove the QX4 on the freeway, for sure I felt a huge sense of security.  All the while, the sales person continued to ask me questions about whether I liked the vehicle.  The QX4 I was driving was an automatic vehicle.  The dealership did not have a stick shift one on display.  I imagine that I would get more mileage with a stick shift.  I can guarantee you that the ride was very smooth.  After all, the QX4 comes equipped with <i>leather seats, 4-way power passenger seat.</i>  It has more features.  They are all goodies you need for your comfort on the road.

<b>What are its features?</b>

The QX4 comes all powered and equipped with a 3.5 liter DOHC 24-valve V6 engine.  It has a good security system.  It also provides you with a keyless entry.  To a large measure, it reminds me of an XTerra which I also test drove a few days earlier.  The leather seats can be adapted to the right temperature.  I think that the QX4 is much wider inside, though.  

Other features include:  Xenon headlights with auto on/off features, new grille and bumper, navigation system, temperature display.  I like the four-way passenger seat above all.  If you are in the market for a new vehicle, I will recommend this to you.  However, if you want power and if you intend to do a lot of pulling, just know that the QX4 is not a V8.  Just keep this information in the back of your mind.  When I was testdriving, I had to be extra cautious when getting on the freeway.  I refrained from getting on in front of a big rig because it will take me some time to accelerate.  Don't underestimate a big rig's speed if you are in a QX4.

Good luck to you!  I have not found my truck yet.
