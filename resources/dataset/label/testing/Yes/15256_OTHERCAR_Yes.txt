            The Sony Mavica is a great digital camera. It's got plenty of features, but still maintains surprising manageability.


<b>Digital Advantage and Disadvantage</b>

The biggest advantage of digital cameras is, no film! This is good if you're taking pictures specifically for computer graphic editing, web pages, projects, etc. 

However, if you want some prints for framing, or for albums, I would only recommend a digital camera to those who have printers designed for the job. I'm currently using an HP 882C, which does a fine job in digital picture printing. For highest quality, I would suggest a specialty color photo laser printer. You'll be amazed by the quality.


<b>Features Galore</b>


<b>Quality and Size Options-</b><i>You can choose the quality of your picture, depending on how much space you have. You'll use more space with higher quality pictures, but they come out dazzling. Normal quality isn't far behind.</i>

<b>Zoom-</b><i>3X digital zoom makes distance photography as great as close-ups.</i>

<b>Viewscreen-</b><i>It's beautiful, bright, clear and backlit. No peeking through small lenses for your pictures, see exactly what you're shooting! It's also fully adjustable concerning contrast, brightness and backlighting.</i>

<b>Flash-</b><i>The flash is bright, but sometimes too bright. However, it's not longer a problem. Set the flash to regular or lower levels. No more white-face portraits.</i>

<b>Movies-</b><i>You can take pictures, and movies with sound! A mini-movie that is. It'll be a few seconds long with sound, and will use up most of your floppy space. Later models of this camera offer optional storage allowing for longer movies. But these movies are just long enough to capture a quick, special moment.</i>

<b>Picture Style-</b><i>You can select from picture options such as landscape, action, daytime, nighttime�and the camera will automatically adjust it's picture-taking settings to best suit your photos.</i>

<b>In-Camera Editing-</b><i>You can view all pictures and movies right from the viewscreen. If you're not happy with something, you can delete it instantly. You can also erase a disk, or copy a disk!</i>

<b>Shooting-</b><i>Choose what you want to photograph, and gently press the shoot button until it focuses. Once focused, you'll hear a beep, and can then depress the button fully to take the picture. </i>

<b>Focus-</b><i>I really love the focus on this camera. It will focus automatically for the clearest pictures. Also, once focused as I mentioned in shooting, it will stay focused as you move the camera, so you won't have to worry too much about a shaky hand.</i>

<b>Effects-</b><i>Yep, you can add effects right in the camera. Before taking a picture, you can view a preview of effects from the selection which contains black and white, sepia, negative or solarized.</i>



<b>Floppy Disk?</b>

I've already mentioned that there is not film needed, but you <i>will</i> need a floppy disk. Now, some digital cameras offer a memory stick instead of or in addition to the floppy. I personally prefer the floppy, for convenience reasons. When you're done taking pictures, you simply put the floppy into the computer and you're done. You can edit and print to your heart's delight from there. It's quick and simple!


<b>Storage</b>

Using regular quality, you will be able to take about 54 pictures on one floppy disk. Using fine quality will allow you to take about half of that amount. If you're recording movies, you'll fit one or two on a single floppy.


<b>Battery</b>

The battery is re-chargeable, charger included. The battery takes a little over an hour to fully charge. A fully charged battery will last you over an hour of picture taking, two hours of picture viewing, and slightly longer in standby mode.

However, if you're short on time, charge the battery for about 20 minutes or so. This will give you enough power to take pictures for about 20-40 minutes.


<b>Adapter</b>

My camera didn't come with an adapter. I can honestly say that I don't know if it's supposed to or not. I recommend asking for it when purchasing the camera. When you have absolutely not time to waste, you just hook the camera up to an outlet and you're good to go.


<b>Low Light</b>

I've heard complaints about low-light pictures with the Mavica. I personally haven't had any problems. I took this camera with me on a cruise, and I took pictures of every sunset, sunrise, bright decks, dark rooms, and even some snaps of the moon and stars. 

You always have the option of flash, but if it's too dark for that, try the low-power flash. I got a bunch of great-looking pictures using no flash in some poorly lit situations.


<b>Ease of Use</b>

Well, my grandpa owns one. It really is simple to use. I never read instructions, and it took me about an hour to feel fully handy with this camera. At first the viewscreen might seem overwhelming, but if you familiarize yourself with the features in this review, you'll get comfortable in no time.


<b>Durability</b>

I feel pretty dumb saying this, but this camera has taken quite a beating. It's bumped into walls, been in many a suitcase, it's been dropped here and there, and it's even been in a rain storm. Any problems? Nope!

So, when you invest your money in this camera, you won't have to worry about treating it too gingerly. It will hold up to everyday to moderately heavy abuse. I don't know about beyond that, you know...I haven't dropped it in the ocean or taken a meat cleaver to it yet!


<b>Anything on the Downside?</b>


<i>Actions�</i>

I'd like to say no, but there are 2 things worth mentioning. As I mentioned above, you have to wait for the 'beep' before actually taking a picture. If you plan to capture a quick moment, like a dolphin jumping out of the water, set the camera to action mode and try to hold a steady hand. This will give you the greatest advantage in such situations with the Mavica.


<i>Weight�</i>

The camera comes with a strap, which takes some of the weight off your hands, but it's still quite a hefty one. If you're looking for something to slip in your pocket, select a later Mavica model. Later ones will give you the option of a tiny camera, instead of a chunky one. I'm not concerned with bulk, and I wouldn't give this camera up for anything. But if you need your hands free, think twice about this model.


<b>Overall</b>

I love this camera! The two downsides I mentioned don't bother me, so I have every reason to be in love with this product. I recommend it for anyone, to bring anywhere. It's has enough features to fit any type of picture you have the desire to take, and it makes the process so simple! 

If you've found this model camera not to entirely suit your needs,  I still recommend sticking with the Sony Mavica line.  I've been very, very impressed with the overall products and quality provided by Sony!
