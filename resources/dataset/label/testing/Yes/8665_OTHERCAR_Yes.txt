            This digital has a very powerful 10X optical lens that gets pictures the other cameras can't.  I love to use it and have taken over 10,000 shots with most of them keepers.

I like the size as I can put it in a jacket pocket and take it to places my Canon Pro 90 just would be too ackward to travel.  If you can hold it steady you will be well rewarded with telephoto shots that capture people without them knowing.  These natural poses are most interesting.

The camera is very full-featured and lacks nothing except perhaps another megapixel.  Newer versions of this camera have just that but at 250 or more in expense.  The 2.1 Megapixel is enough for a minor cropping and a 5x7 blow-up.  Since most of my photos are 4x6's this is all I really need.  Very good quality clear shots.  Would like better low light capabilities as there is some noise.  Color in very low light is fair, but correctable using minor touch-up on the computer.

The panoramic mode works with Olympus smart media only.  Perhaps newer versions will work with other brands of storage media.

When this one give out I will likely buy another.  Right now I have taken 10,000 pictures and no problems.
