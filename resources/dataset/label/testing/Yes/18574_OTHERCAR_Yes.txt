            After looking through a plethora of digital cameras at my local CompUSA, I chose Casio's QV-8000SX. I selected this model for several major reasons. One the camera is reasonably priced, especially when compared to its ling list of features. 

And talking about features, the QV-8000SX has a laundry list full of them. It has a wonderful 8x zoom, color selection modes that even allow a sepia print setting. And probably the most important feature, very high picture quality. Another feature which I found particularly appealing is the screw mount on the lens. Going back to my 35mm roots, I like the idea of being able to add a filter to protect the lens proper.

The only feature missing from this excellent unit is an ac adapter. This has to be purchased separately. But apart from that, it's a great camera at a great price.<br><br>
