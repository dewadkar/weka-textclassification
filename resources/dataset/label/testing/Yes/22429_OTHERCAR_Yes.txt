            I've been looking for a small digital camera for quite a while now. My first (and only other) digital camera was this huge AGFA 640x480 camera that ate up AA batteries even when I wasn't using it. Comparing the Pentax Optio-S to it is like comparing walking to a Star Trek transporter -- HUGE difference!

I was initially set on the Canon Elph series (either the s230 or the s400) but after seeing this one in person I had to get it. You really need to go to a store and hold one to appreciate how small it is. What is even better is that it has 3x optical zoom, 3.2MP (2048x1536), movie mode, voice recorder mode, tons of settings for pictures (which as a novice I will probably never use) and many other things.

This is really a technological marvel. Amazingly, it has true 3x optical zoom using a sliding lens system that allows it to be thinner than other telescoping lens cameras. It also has a built-in mic and speaker for audio recording and playback. The LCD is 1.6" and unlike the Sony Cybershot, there is also an optical viewfinder.

<b>Picture Features</b>
Like I said, I'm just a novice but this camera has many features for customizing your picture taking process. There are 7 modes: Landscape, Flower, Portrait, Self-Portrait, Surf & Snow, Autumn Color and Sunset. There is a Macro mode that can be used as little as 2.4 inches. There are also color effects that you can use such as Black and White, Sepia and other colors.

<b>Movie Mode</b>
The Optio-S is equipped to record 30-second 320x240 AVIs (with sound). Unfortunately you cannot use the optical zoom in this mode but for quick little videos it's great.

<b>Audio Recorder</b>
You can also use this as voice recorder. And... each picture can have a 30-second voice memo added to it.

<b>Other features</b>
There are many other things such as on-camera editing and cropping, continuous shooting mode, exposure control, white balance, red-eye reduction and metering but you should just check out the Pentax website to get all that information.

<b>Memory and Connectivity</b>
The camera has 11MB of internal memory so you can actually use it without a card. But 11MB runs out pretty quickly so you really need to buy a media card (it doesn't come with one). The Optio-S uses the Secure Digital (SD) format. For connectivity it uses a USB 2.0 connector and also has A/V output.

<b>Usage and Performance</b>
Having had this camera for less than a month, it's very hard for me to describe the performance because the only other digital camera I've had to compare to was the previously mentioned AGFA (which is easily over 5 times bigger than the Pentax). I can tell you that you do have to get used to the small size and using the controls takes some learning. The main control is like a little 5-way control pad that you sometimes push down by accident instead of up/down/left/right. As for actual picture taking, it works great but you may miss the exact picture you want to take because there is a lag of about a quarter of a second. However, I've noticed this happens in my other camera and using other people's digicams. There is probably a setting to turn off whatever causes this lag (maybe the autofocus), but I haven't yet found it. Start up speed is very quick, you are ready to go in about 3 seconds. The pictures come out pretty good. I'm not very picky as I'm more concerned with portability then "professional quality photos" but from the sites I've read and samples I've seen, this camera is very comparable to other 3.2MPs. I do notice that from a distance, the flash doesn't work quite as well but these were outdoor night shots. Indoors it works fine, but maybe too well because some of the photos I've taken looked a little washed out. There is probably some setting I can adjust to correct that but this camera has so many things it's hard to keep track. Again, as a novice, I bought this camera based more on size and some basic features such as true optical zoom and resolution. The movie mode and other picture settings are all bonuses.

<b>Durability</b>
The camera body is made of a brushed aluminum alloy. It's light but feels very sturdy. The build is solid and is suprisingly well-made.  But because of the size of this camera, I'm not about to throw it around. 

<b>Problems</b>
My main gripe is how the battery is charged. You have to remove the battery from the camera and put it into a separate charger. I would have preferred it to be a cradle charger because I'm afraid that the hinge on the door to the battery is not made of the sturdiest material. Other complaints I've read is the battery doesn't last very long but it's hard to expect hours and hours of picture taking from something so small. The other thing is the on/off button and the shutter button are right next to each other. When I give it to someone to use, I always have to tell them "It's the bigger button."

And yes... I do use an Altoids tin for my case. I bought mine at Costco, it was $10 less than retail, came with a 128MB SD card and a leather case. But I don't use the case because I wanted sturdier protection. It just so happens that the Altoids tin is perfect. I line it with a little paper towel I cut out and it's good to go. And that's how I got the title of the article, because whenever I take it out of the tin to use, someone always says "Is that a camera?"
