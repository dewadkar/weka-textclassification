              I fell in love with this car when my father purchased it a year ago and let my mom and I take it on a 3000 mile trip. Lucky me, I got to drive. Even luckier for me, when my car was totaled in an accident, my father sold it to me so he could buy a newer Aurora. 

  This is definitely the best car I've ever owned. The power seats adjust to fit anyone comfortably. I especially like the lumbar support. Living in Iowa, I appreciate the heated seats...my butt warms up it minutes. In the summer, the sun roof is great. 

  Cd and tape player are standard and they sound great. There is an LED display of all kinds of things, gas mileage, gallons used, oil pressure, day and date...I can't even remember them all.It also has automatic climate control and passenger side control.

  I haven't had any mechanical or electrical problems with it. But I do know it costs more to drive than my previous cars. The gas mileage in town is only around 19 and 30 on the highway. The oil and tire changes cost more too...but having a V8 and cool tires is worth it.
