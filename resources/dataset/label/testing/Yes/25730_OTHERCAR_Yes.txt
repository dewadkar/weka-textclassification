            My oldest child is about to get her driver's license.  I drive a van, but I'm really a small-car-lover.  The Bug was rated the safest compact car last year.  It's a well-made car for the price.  There are so many reasons I could write, but bottom line is it's a really fun car to drive!

When you drive the Bug, people are nice to you.  Other cars let you merge into their lane.  People point at your car as you drive by and smile.  It's a very comfortable car to drive.  It responds well, has excellent visibility, good pick-up,good brakes, and gets excellent gas mileage (mid-20's/gallon).  We were able to fit our family of five in it comfortably, but to do so, you need to have a third seatbelt added to the rear seat.  The trunk has a surprisingly large storage capacity, and it can fold down to use the back seat area, for additional storage space.  Although it's a two-door, the back seats were easy to get in and out of.

Although the car is not very expensive, as cars go these days, it is very well made.  I expect to one day be a member of the over-100,000-miles VW club!  Being in the Bug makes sitting in traffic bearable!<br><br>
