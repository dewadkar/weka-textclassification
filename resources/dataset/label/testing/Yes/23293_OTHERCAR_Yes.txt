            My family has pretty much stayed in thr Chevrolet family, so when it was time to buy my first car at 18, going and getting a cavalier was an easy choice.  I bought the car in 97 for my 18th birthday and have had no problems with it except the normal maintenance.  The only major thing that has been wrong with it is the alternator has had to be fixed, but other than that, its been smooth running.  I love the sporty look and the only reason I dont have it now is cause I moved to Hawaii and couldnt bring it with me.   After 10 years its still running like a charm and will be for a long time.  I would definately recommend this to everyone who wants a reliable, dependable, and affordable car.  <br><br>
