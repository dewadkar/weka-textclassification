            When somebody just thinks about car and have in mind European car right away got scared about price, but expecting very good quality for money. The New Golf is one of those, but for less money you are getting really something you never dreamed about if you drove car from US or Japan.
Golf's stability on road, conformability, great gear box with short and straight shifting, very good engine (if for somebody 4cyl. 2L 105hp is not enough, there is V6 engine too, but with 2 doors Golf only) and overall comfort makes a car to be wanted. Golf is perfect city car, but it's also very comfortable to travel with it on longer trips. Design is made that you can not simply forgot that you saw Golf on the street and everybody likes it. Golf is very easy to drive and you can feel solid German car. Golf is not soft as some French cars, but still very comfortable.
Golf is not &quot;big&quot; car. On back seat is not too roomy, and you do not have a big trunk, but enough for a couple with a small kid. Golf is not a race car, but it can be driven to get a few tickets without problems.....
