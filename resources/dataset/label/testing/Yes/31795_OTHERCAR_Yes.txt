            We bought our new silver Honda Civic EX on October 17, 2000 from AutoNation. So far we are very happy with the car. There were several minor defects covered under warranty which the dealer fixed promptly. As with any new models there will be defects. 


Value:
For the money, the EX model included everything you'd expect from a non-luxury vehicle. Side-airbags is the only option.

Performance:
The 1.7 Liter Vtech engine requires above 5000rpms to attain peak horsepower. This car drives like a motorcycle. The clutch and gas pedals are relatively light. The manual 5 speed shifts accurately. The handling, however, is sub-par compared to the earlier models. The car rides more like a Toyota Camry now. The driver no longer feels connected to the road as with the older double-wish bone front suspension. Honda has tamed the Civic to be more family-car-like rather than a boy-racer. Driving enthusiasts will NOT like the handling!

Interior:
The dash is typical Honda thus easy to master. Non-Honda owners will have to get use to the moonroof controls on the dash to the left of the steering wheel. The seats are comfortable and lined with good quality cloth. I find the front headrests rather bulky and unattractive. The driver's seat has a fold-up right arm rest in addition to height adjustment...minor...but indispensable features for long distance driving comfort. The advertised rear flat floor combined with the fold-down rear seat allows the Civic to carry even large boxes.

In sum, this is a perfect car for a young family. Street racing enthusiast should look elsewhere for a car to modify.
