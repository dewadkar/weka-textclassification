            When the lease ran out on my Dodge Intrepid ES, I started shopping for its replacement.  As usual with me, the first criteria was legroom as I stand 6'7".  I also wanted to continue with a car that had good handling and power and, because of the nature of my work, something with some cargo capacity.  All of this put together meant that the VW Passat Wagon came up on the screen rather quickly.  I took delivery of my silver Passat GLS in late March, 2000 and have run up almost 20,000 miles since then.  Here is the scorecard so far:
Reliability:  This is the first car I have ever had that has ZERO defects.  Other than routine service, there has been no reason whatsoever to visit the dealer, as nice as they are (McMinnville Toyota/VW in Oregon).
Engine/Drivetrain:  I have the 2.8-litre VR6 with the 5-speed box.  The engine is a sheer delight - lots of power if you use the rev's.  Below 3000 rpm, you will want to drop a gear, but with this engine's delightful sound and feel, you won't mind.  The 5-speed manual is OK, but could be better.  Throws are a touch long and vague for this to be a true "sport" box although you do get used to it.  The clutch is hydraulic, self-adjusting and awfully hard to get the feel of, though I've gotten better over time.  Running shoes are best for spirited driving.  Effort is light, so it doesn't get tiresome in traffic, just a bit vague on takeup.  I did drive a demo with the Tipronic automatic, but it really is not that great an automanual, being a first generation design.  It's OK, just not for me.
Mileage:  In my daily use cycle, mileage has average a solid 23 mpg on a combination of city and 4-lane roads.  Long trips (I do I-5 Portland to Seattle once or twice a month) kicks that average up to 32 mpg at speeds that are (ahem) somewhat above the posted limit (car sounds and feels the same going 80 as it does 60).  Make up your mind that you are going to put in premium; the fuel injection computer likes 91 octane.
Interior:  I never thought I would be able to ever have a car with a sunroof given my height.  I have a sunroof and an inch or better to spare.  Legroom is great - better than any car I have owned and most trucks that I won't buy.  The seats are a little narrow, but well padded with variable lumbar support.  I have the leather (came as part of the GS package) with the heated seat option.  I will never be without that combination again; it is simply wonderful on a cold winter day.  Controls are well laid out and easy to reach.  The heating and air conditioning are run from two dials and two buttons and you don't have to take your eyes off the road to change a setting.  I have had no problem staying comfortable in the high 90's, so the air works well.  With the seats folded down, there is an awesome amount of room in the back.  I hauled an HP Color Laserjet in its shipping box with the hatch closed and room to spare.  Glad I bought the wagon.
Handling and Brakes:  Make no mistake, this is a sports sedan.  The weakest links are the OEM tires.  They sell the Passat with two brands; Continental and Michelin.  The Conti's are awful; hard, noisy and they numb the steering feel.  The Michelin's are much better, especially in the wet (Oregon, remember), but they are still general purpose tires, so they have a pretty low grip limit and the squeal getting to it.  They do wear like iron though.  Best thing to improve handling - larger wheels with lower profile and stickier rubber.  It is in the car's future.  Steering is power assisted and feel is directly related to the quality of rubber (see above).  The lightness is a benefit if you take your weight off your arms when you are going to do some serious roadwork.  Then the car is a delight to carve apexes with and the steering is direct, accurate and positive.  Yet the boost is just enough to keep the car from being a burden in traffic or during parking manouvers.  The brakes - disks all around - are about what you would expect on a German car.  Which is to say - outstanding.  Good pedal feel, unobtrusive ABS, and a very definite ability to haul the fully loaded wagon down from speeds you likely will never see anywhere other than an autobahn.  The Automatic Skid Resistance (ASR) traction contol is likewise helpful in wet/slippery situations but not overbearing in normal driving.
Value:  Last time I checked, retail BlueBook on the car was within less than $500 of the captialization cost on my lease.
Conclusion:  A solid, practical, fun to drive German sport wagon that is easy to maintain, reliable to a fault and a delight to own.  Would I buy one again?  I may actually buy this one when it comes off its lease.
Final note:  It is illegal to eat and drink while driving on the German autobahn.  This is probably why the cup holders in this car will actually hold cups only if the car is standing still.
