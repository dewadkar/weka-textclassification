            I have owned a Hyundai Elantra wagon for about 7 months now, and I have had only a great experience with it. The warranty that comes with it is exceptional, it lasts the entire length of the 5 year loan and the powertrain is warrantied for 10yrs/100,000 miles. The only thing to pay for is maintenance on the car. A while back the car was recalled for something in the transmission and it was immediately taken car of and a rental car was given to me to drive while it was being fixed, at no charge. That's service! The car rides so smoothly and gets great gas mileage. I couldn't ask for a better car at such a reasonable price.<br><br>
