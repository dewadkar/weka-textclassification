            I bought Mavica for one reason:  the floppy internal drive.  I bought mine at Best Buy in spring '00 for about $700, plus about $75 for an extra life battery.  

I have been into photography more than 30 years, have roughly $20,000 in Leica and Rollei equipment.  I am still not thrilled about the obsolescence of 35mm, but with our diminishing resources electronics is going to be the only way to go for amateurs.  

This Mavica, like all its cousins, is necessarily larger than most other digicams.  However, this shouldn't be seen as a disadvantage.  This camera is much easier to hold for inexperienced hands than most of the smaller competitors.  

I haven't used all the options on the camera; some, like the 'sepia' option, are of no use to me.  Picture quality is as expected for a digicam; that is, good for smaller photo sizes.  

The biggest drawback on this camera, which I didn't realize when I bought it, is that there is no optical viewfinder.  If you are trying to take photos outside in daylight, it get very hard to see on the LCD screen due to light washout.  I would advise anyone looking for a new camera NOT to buy one without the optical viewfinder.  

The floppy disk allows you to take literally infinite photos without having to connect up to a computer. This is really great at parties and get-togethers; you can take one floppy full of snaps, then simply have the camera duplicate any number of copies and just give them out!  

I'll probably buy a memory stick camera in the near future, one with optical viewfinder and screen, but the Mavica will remain a workhorse for me!
