            Several years ago, I bought an Olympus D200L digital camera. With a max. resolution of 640x480, it was one of the best (remember, I said it was a few years ago). Although we soon noticed the resolution's shortcomings, the picture quality was so good we overlooked it...for awhile.

Well, now that 3-5 megapixel cameras are the mainstream, it may seem odd that I could recommend a 2.0 megapixel camera...but that is exactly what I am saying here. 

The bottom line is that for the money, you can't get any better than this. I picked this camera up at Circuit City for $149, and spent an extra $40 for 2 64MB SM cards (not at circuit city, they wanted twice that). Cash is tight, but we were ready to replace the old D200L (it has been dropped several times, and though it still works it may not for long!)

To cut to the chase, the picture quality is everything I expected. The color is great and super clear. I think the quality rivals 3.0 megapixel cameras that my friends have, and it's so easy to use even my wife likes it.

It does have a couple drawbacks...

Quicktime mode is limited to 15 seconds no matter how big the memory card is...it would be nice to have at least double that. Also, movie mode is limited to available light. 

The zoom could be better...with only a digital zoom, you can't get really close in (although th macro mode is a nice feature for close-ups). Also, you must use the LCD viewer with the zoom.

That being said, everything else is just great. The battery life is awesome. It uses regular or rechargeable AA batteries (4) and I have had the 4 original batteries in there for about 200 pictures and they are still working fine, including using the LCD A LOT to view & delete photos.

The SM cards are great because, since they are apparently on the way out, they are dirt cheap (advice: stock up in case the camera is still working and you can no longer find them any more...my last Olympus has lasted 5+ years and continues to work after several 3 foot falls and liquid incidents. It would be a shame to have a perfectly good camera and no longer be able to get the "film").

I'd give this camera a 9.5 out of 10, and for $150 you just can't go wrong!
