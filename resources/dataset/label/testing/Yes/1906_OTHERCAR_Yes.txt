            <b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>
I saw flashes of it in their commercial before they brought it into the Nissan showrooms all across America.  It looked sharper on TV than in real life.  I was rather disappointed in the design of the rear portion of the car, as it takes some getting used to.  The front looks a lot like the Altima, yet it had a much <i>meaner</i> and wider stance.  The new Maxima really has a &quot;<i>Love it</i> or <i>Hate it</i>&quot; design.  

With <b>standard 17&quot; alloy wheels</b> the <b>2000 Maxima SE</b> looks like it can seriously corner on a dime.  I did a thorough walk-around before being engulfed by the leather seats.  The 'new-car-smell' was <i>oh-so-good</i>...  BUT, I wasn't there to be won over by the Maxima.  It had to earn my liking...

<b>INTERIOR FIT &amp; FINISH:</b>
Nissan, like many other Japanese auto manufacturers, has worked long and hard to perfect anything and everything dealing with the production of their line of cars.  Just to pinpoint a part of what Nissan automobiles go through during production, there is an inspector at the end of the assembly line that checks for dust by rubbing his/her white gloves over certain areas of the car.  If it doesn't pass the <i>White-Glove</i> test, it is tagged with a marker and is dealt with later with extreme care.  

The rear seats are very comfortable.  There's ample leg and headroom, as well as enough space for three adults for the back (although two would be ideal).  There is a full <b>15 cu. ft. of trunk space</b> which is quite useful.  

I noticed that the interior resembled that of finer luxury automobiles.  It's more common to see this in more and more models of cars these days.  It doesn't need to be a luxury car to be equipped with climate control or leather seats.  The <b>200-watt Bose stereo</b> along with the other controls on the Maxima were very nicely fit into the dash.  The titanium-faced dials may take some getting used to by some, but I thought it fit well with the sporty SE package.  The shifter is wrapped in leather (both automatic and manual transmissions).   

<b>PERFORMANCE:</b>
Now were talkin'...  All 2000 Maximas come with the standard <b>222 horsepower V6 engine</b>, which is a substantial increase in output from the previous Maxima engine.  Nonetheless, this engine is silky-smooth in feel and the power is plenty.    

From acceleration to cruising speed, I just got the sense of driving a powerhouse.  It was amazing how much power this family sedan had and I wanted so badly to see what this bad boy was capable of doing.  Just like one of the commercials, I wanted to do one of those slow-motion skidding-sideways-while-trying-to-regain-control moves on a dusty flat.  After a while, you feel that you can do just about anything in the Maxima.  In other words, you feel confident... confident going into the passing lane to pass a slow semi-truck, confident in maneuvering out of an emergency situation, confident in just about everything.

Then I was wondering about other sports cars and how they would handle... but let's admit it, they usually have two less doors and they can't seat your wife, two kids, and the dog!  

<b>FEATURES ON THE 2000 MAXIMA SE:</b> 
The standard features either make or break a car.  I believe that Nissan threw in just enough standard features to make the Maxima SE a good package... but I still can't believe how car manufacturers still get away with offering <i>floor mats</i> as an option?!

- 3.0 liter 24-valve V6 engine (222 HP)
- 5-speed manual transmission
- 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS
- Cruise control
- Front airbags
- Sport-tuned suspension
- AC
- Power windows, locks, and mirrors
- Int wipers
- Titanium tined gauges
- AM/FM stereo cassette and CD player w/ 6 speakers
- Rear spoiler
- 17&quot; alloy wheels
- Fog lights
- Tinted tail lights, grille, and badging
- Remote keyless entry
- Center armrest/console
- 60/40 split folding rear seats

<b>Optional Equipment</b>: automatic transmission, glass moonroof, traction control system (only with automatic transmission), 200-watt Bose stereo system, side airbags, climate control, leather trim, floor mats are optional (<i>can't believe they're still charging for this!!!</i>), and splash guards. 

<b>WARRANTY:</b>
Nissan offers a <b>3-year/36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty</b> along with a <b>5-year/60,000 mile drivetrain warranty</b>.  The Maxima also comes with a <b>5-year/100,000 mile rust/corrosion warranty</b>, but <i>roadside assistance is <b>not offered</b></i>.

<b>FUEL ECONOMY:</b>
Since this car is geared towards families, it needs to get fairly good gas mileage.  With the amount of power the Maxima puts out, it gets an average of <b>21 MPG in the city and 27 MPG on the highway</b> (manual transmission).  The automatic transmission model gets an average of <b>20 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway</b>  It has a <b>fuel capacity of 18.5 gallons</b> which makes this car very well suited for road trips.

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
For about $23,000 to $24,000 you can pick up a brand new, nicely equipped Maxima SE.  This is probably the most powerful sedan with a lot of nice amenities you can purchase for this price range.  The Honda Accord V6 only offers 200 horsepower and the Toyota Camry V6 only puts out 194 horsepower.     

The <b>2000 Nissan Maxima SE</b> proves to be a smooth runner in the race for family sedans, once again.  Yes, the price is slightly higher and the design takes longer to get used to, but once you drive one, you'll take back all the bad things you've been saying about it.  For the fathers out there who are pressured by their wives into selling their two-door pride-n-joy, look into the Maximas.  Don't limit yourself in just taking one other person on a nice summer drive, take the whole family!  <br><br>
