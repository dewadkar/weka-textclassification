            I bought my first car recently.  A used '91 Toyota Corolla, 72,000 miles.  No small feat for a woman, especially with the horror stories abounding of patronizing dealers and lemons that could suck a wallet dry.

But I love my car.

It runs like a charm.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to take it in for more than an oil change: new belts and a tire rotation are the extent of its work.  Brakes on a dime, handles well, and good mileage on gas.  Everyone who has driven it raves about it.  It's a solid little machine, and it serves its purpose quietly and without fuss.  Never a stall, never any difficulty starting up.  We've gone a good 15,000 miles together, and I don't have a single regret.

Other pros? Great leg and head room all around.  I've trundled sleeping friends in the back seat, and napped in it myself.  Good visibility, good trunk size.  All the amenities: a/c, cigarette lighter, four speakers.  I put in my own stereo, but the original was pretty good.  

My only objection would be the seat belts.  In the '91, both shoulder and lap belt have to be locked into place, and the shoulder belt has a rather confusing waist-to-door trajectory.  I prefer the automatic belts that slide up and down.  But it's a small price to pay for a car that guarantees me transport and safety.  I would recommend it to anyone.	<br><br>
