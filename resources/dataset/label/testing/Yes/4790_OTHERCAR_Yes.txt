            Designed for the great outdoors, the DC5000 is Kodak�s answer to the camera you take anywhere. It�s built around the DC290 mechanism but with heavy-duty casing and oversized controls so you can use it with gloves on. It�s also water-resistant but don�t take it swimming. With megapixels resolution, the DC5000 looks, feels and takes images like a real film camera. Images are stored on a CompactFlash memory card, and an 8Mb card is standard kit. As with most cameras, there�s a 1.8inch TFT LCD screen and a 2x-optical/3x-digital zoom. The auto focus lens is threaded so you can add protective filters, and the built-in flash has a strobe option to reduce �red-eye� problems. 

Special effects include black and white mode, sepia toning as well as instant decorative borders. You can also get a video out option in either NTSC or Australian PAL format. Connection to you PC is via USB or standard serial port. It comes with software ready for Windows or MacOS computers and you need about 120Mb-disk space. The package includes a lens filter and cap to protect it from harsh environments. Picture quality was very hard to fault. On the highest setting, you can just see the effects of JPEG compression, but you have to look very hard to find them. The colour accuracy was also very good, producing warm yet bright colours.

The DC5000 is an excellent choice if you spend a lot of time out in the bush.
