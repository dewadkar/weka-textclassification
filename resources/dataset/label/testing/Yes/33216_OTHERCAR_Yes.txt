            We bought the 1997 Honda Accord SE (Special Edition) when our Grand Am was getting old and unreliable.  I already knew I wanted a Honda or Toyota, due to the high reliability and customer satisfaction of those makers.  (I had a 1989 Toyota Corolla which I loved and sold to my sister, who is still driving it at 130,000 miles.)  The Accord was used with about 8,000 miles, but looked brand new.  I really wanted the CD player, which comes with the SE edition, but I believe it costs extra to add it to the &quot;entry-level&quot; LE.  The SE also comes with a &quot;moon roof&quot; (I think &quot;moon roofs&quot; sell better than &quot;sun roofs&quot; here in Texas!).  That is not an essential item to me, but it's nice to have once in while.  The SE also comes with alloy wheels, which my husband assures me look a lot better than the standard wheels.  For aesthetic reasons, we also had a spoiler added to the trunk of the car when we bought it.  This useless hunk of plastic costs $700 but even I can tell the car looks &quot;sportier&quot; with it.   My bottom line is reliability, and this car has been very reliable.  Comfort is also important, and I like the fact that I can adjust the seat and steering wheel to make myself as comfortable as possible, since I commute about 60 miles a day.  I have noticed that the controls in Japanese cars seem to better designed for ease of use relative to American models.  I can adjust the air, radio, cruise control, and other controls without having to reach very far or fumble around.  I get about 30 miles per gallon, which is also important for a commuter on a budget.    There are only a couple of drawbacks to this car:  lack of power (4-cylinder engine) and the air conditioner is not sufficiently frosty enough to beat back the mid-summer sun in Texas very quickly.   I would recommend this car as a great all-purpose vehicle and a good value with great resale value.<br><br>
