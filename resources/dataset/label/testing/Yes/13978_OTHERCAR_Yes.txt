               We always purchased new American cars, and many of them were very fine cars.  After acquiring them, my husband was always underneath them or bringing them back to have one thing or another fixed.  Our daughter had purchased two Honda Accords and NEVER really did anything to them -- especially crawl under them or have any draconion service done to them. We considered her "ease"  of ownership vis-a-vis my husband's existence underneath them and decided to purchase a Honda Accord.

   Update:  We have been so happy with our first Honda that in December, 2000, we purchased a second car!  Yes, another Honda, this time being a Honda Civic!  I'm not sure that we will ever go back to American cars again.
  
   We love the smooth, rounded lines and the ease of washing and cleaning the car.  One can reach over the roof.  The car has a four-cylinder engine which means that we consistently get GOOD gas mileage in the 30's to the HIGH 30's (or 40's if you drive 50 mph or under). We can say that the car is rather cumbersome to get into (you stoop), and the room inside (including the trunk is adequate, but barely. Good enough for us. The rear window is a little high to look through while backing up.
   The car is easy and excellent to drive.  It is low and "hugs" the road at any speed; indeed, we've swerved to avoid hitting many deer, while the persons behind us hit the animals.  One man remarked to my husband,"Wow! you sure are a terrific driver!" My husband replied after easily experiencing no "swail" in the swerving, " It is NOT me; it is the car!" The car is easy to drive, to park, to steer, to brake, to accelerate; and best of all, the maintenance is extremely low. The wind noise is very low.  Our car has NEVER  been in a garage at 50,000 miles! NOTHING has gone wrong!    
    If you want a car which is really not pretty (but why does EVERYONE copy it: you know, they all look alike in their trying to "Hondaize" the style of the other cars -- foreign or American -- then buy a Honda Accord! 
It was our first foreign car-- but not our last.  We'd run to get another!
