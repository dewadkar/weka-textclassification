            While in college, I begged my dad to buy me a digital camera to be able to put images on my website and in emails for my family to see 3000 miles away. I was tired of scanning in my pictures from my regular camera and I was too impatient to wait to get them developed. This is the camera my dad bought for me.

This is a great camera if you're looking for your first digital camera. It's inexpensive and easy to use. There are quality choices from regular to superhigh quality which determines the detail and the size of the photo on your computer. It's got flash, timer, and red-eye options. It's pretty much like a standard camera in other ways. Just point and click, no lens zooming in and out.

This camera isn't fancy. It's just a good basic, easy-to-use point and click digital camera. If it's your first digital camera, you'll be impressed with being able to look at your picture right away and deleting it and retaking it if you don't like it. Plus, everyone is impressed to get to see the picture right away. In addition, it makes it easy to send via email and put on the web. It's easy even to get it developed. I just go to the local photo store with a floppy with the best quality of my images and they put them on nice glossy or matte film paper overnight for 60 cents each! 

My advice is to get a FlashPath disk to put your images on the computer. Hooking up the camera to the computer and doing it that way just eats up batteries. With the FlashPath disk, you just put the smartcard from your camera into the disk and put the disk in your floppy (A) drive, and they're right there in your computer and you just copy them over! It's great! Plus, it's so portable!
