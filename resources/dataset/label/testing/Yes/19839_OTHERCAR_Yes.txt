            At first I hated this car, yet now after having it for a year it has grown on me.  Being a teenager and having this car as my first has taught me very valuable lessons on road safety, because when you have such a big car (Nicknamed: My Impala Cruise Ship), you learn to be more cautious.  It has been in the shop many times, but all in all it has been a pretty good first car.
              This car was given to me by my 90 year old great aunt and some adjustments had to be made, specifically so I could see over the wheel.  I love when the car drives really smoothly, as most people would probably agree, just like pets or anything else, a car has its own unique personality.  My Impala likes to go fast, (although this classic only gets up to 80 mph) and it is finicky on some days of the month and the engine gets flooded, which I think is a pain to deal with.  This car has a lot of space for my friends to sit and for all the objects I could collect.  The seats are really comfortable and you could sit it them for a long time without your booty hurting. It has air brakes which can be irritating, but the good thing is that it is made out of steel, like most cars back in the day, which is a feature you do not see on those plastic looking mustangs and things.  The mechanics, whom I visited so frequently, told me that I would be much safer getting into a wreck in this car than one of the newer ones.
                                   Despite all the problems, I am going to miss my Impala.  It will probably be better off with one of those car - show types who could paint it and give it a brand new life. <br><br>
