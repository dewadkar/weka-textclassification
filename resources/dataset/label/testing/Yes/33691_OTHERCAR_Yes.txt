              The 1990 <b> Lexus LS 400 </b> is a very well engineered automobile. My mother owns one of these. It has over 120,000 miles on it. She paid around $25,000 for her car. She purchased it used about five years ago from the local <b> Lexus </b> dealership. I have driven this car on occasion, most recently on a round trip of over 1500 miles to Florida and back.

  This is a great car for traveling because of its comfort and dependability. In the five years my mother has owned this car the only significant problem she has had is when the battery exploded. Yes, it literally exploded! Fortunately, the battery is contained in a heavy plastic case and the explosion was contained to this small area. A little excitement but no major problem.

  The <b> Lexus LS </b> is an attractive car. It has a classic styling that is not gaudy or showy. The paint job has held up very well and there are no chips or flakes anywhere on the car. Mother's car is a plain white that they call Pearl. It also comes Champagne, Black, Red, and other colors. The headlights and tail lights are large and positioned so that they can be readily seen by others especially in night traffic. It has a large brake light in the rear window. The tires are <b> Michelin </b> and have worn well and never given any trouble. The trunk is roomy. On our recent trip, we were able to pack three people's suitcases in it easily. The spare is located out of the way in a compartment below the trunk area.

  The interior is well planned and very functional. The leather upholstered seats provide comfort and support. The dashboard is uncluttered and easy to use. I found the light switch bewildering and had to fumble with it a bit. This car has a quality stereo with four speakers located throughout the car. The backseats are not at all roomy. I would rate the legroom only adequate.

   The performance of this <b> Lexus </b> is first rate. It provides a smooth and quiet ride. It's not a sports car but it can still get up and go. The manual transmission responds well . It has an overdrive button but I can not tell any difference in performance whether this button is engaged or not. The brakes are beginning to show some wear and will need to be attended to soon. The gas mileage is noting spectacular but it was over 20 miles per gallon on the trip.

   Mother takes her <b> Lexus </b> to the dealership for scheduled maintenance religiously. They take very good care of her and always provide her with a very nice 'loaner' car while hers is in the shop. One of the sales persons lives in her neighborhood and will thoughtfully bring her Mother's car to her at the end of his day.

  I think this is a very good automobile. It has been a very dependable and safe car. It has safety features such as reinforced door panels and driver airbags. The dealership has been wonderful. If you are looking for quality and value, I think the <b> Lexus LS </b> is a great place to look.
