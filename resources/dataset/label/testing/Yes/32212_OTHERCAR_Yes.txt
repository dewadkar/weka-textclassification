   This is the best sports car on the planet, and although I don't own own.  I was lucky enough to drive a 1999 convertible, but I don't know which exact model.  It was a great experience because I have always wanted to drive one, ever since my matchbox car days I always picked the porsches first.  This car has power to spare, and the looks I got while driving it were priceless.  Being only 22 years old got me tons of looks, and people couldn't beleive that I was driving it.  
   When and if I ever aquire the funds to purchase one I will get to live my dream.  I absolutely love these cars.

anyone who can afford one should go out and buy one, if only because they can.  <br><br>
