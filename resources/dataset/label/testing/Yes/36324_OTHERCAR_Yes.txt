                 I would like to start off this review by saying that in a million years, I would never have thought that I'd be able to afford such an incredible car.  It is extremely inexpensive for what the car offers its owner.  Let me put it in dollar amounts for you.  There aren't many cars that can compete with the Camaro SS for less than $55,000- $60,000, or even higher.  I'll get into that a little bit more later.
     Let's go over performance first.  It�s got 335 horsepower (with the dual-dual exhaust option that my car is fitted with) and 350 lb-ft of torque.  What does that mean? Here�s where it works out on paper.  Acceleration times are scorching.  It reaches 0-60 in 5.2 seconds.  It's 0-100 time is 11.8 seconds.  It completes the 1/4 mile in 13.25 seconds at about 109 m.p.h.  I hate to disappoint all of the Porsche Boxter, SVT Cobra Mustang, & Ferrari 355 Spyder owners out there, but those numbers will have me waiting for you guys at the end of the 1/4 mile, with about a quarter or a half of a second to spare for perhaps a little chuckle on my behalf.  The SS�s acceleration numbers are pretty much the same as the Porsche 911 Carrera 4, except you�ll be savoring an additional 5 miles per gallon highway.  It gets 19mpg city/ 28 highway.  Pretty amazing for a Chevy V-8, I�d have to say.  Just for your reference, the Ferrari 355 Spyder can be yours for the tune of $137,000.  The $30,000 window sticker on THIS car just puts the icing on the cake. 
     The '02 Camaro SS handles as if it is on rails, the power that it has to offer (pretty much anywhere in the R.P.M. range) leaves nothing to be desired, and the 6-speed manual transmission with the Hurst "short-throw" shifter is matched beautifully with the car's LS-1 5.7 Liter 350 C.I. V-8 engine.  It's power isn't either "on or off" either.  It's fairly difficult to get the car to lose control unless you want it to.  It's extremely well balanced.  The car�s slalom speeds and braking distances say a lot as well.  This car is just an all-around win-win sports car.
      Sure, you�ll get the people that say things like �There�s no room in this thing�, or �It sits too low�.  Of course it does!  It�s a sports car!  There�s not supposed to be room for 5 with groceries in the trunk!  If that�s your bag, perhaps you should be looking into reviews for the TrailBlazer or the Excursion.   Some people might mention that the interior is �plain-Jane�.  Chevrolet employed the �back to basics� concept on the interior design.  Chevrolet enthusiasts might argue �What else do you need?!�  I would agree.  All controls are extremely easy access, allowing the driver to keep his/ her eyes on the road, with no fiddling around. 
       Let�s make it plain & simple.  Your guy friends will think your car is �badass�, while girls will think it�s beautiful.  I can�t seriously and honestly think of a bad thing to put in this review about this car.  I�d done research for about the last year on cars that I was going to buy, and I�m in this one.  That says a lot.  (Just for the record, I would�ve preferred the �02 Corvette Z06, but my finances would not allow it at this time.  LOL!  Besides, there are more of those on the road than there are �02 Camaro SS�s.)   That�s it from me.

     If you�d like to see a great site for finding information on various car�s performance numbers, go to http://www.fantasycars.com/derek/list.html     That�s where I found (and confirmed) a lot of statistics.  Besides, if you love cars as much as I do, it�s just fun!
