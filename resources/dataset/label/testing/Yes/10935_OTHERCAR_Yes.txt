            UPDATE:  I have owned this car for another two years or so since my original review. Below are my musings...

During this two year period I put some serious work into this car to further customize it and make it perfect for my needs.  For those of you regretting not ordering the sport package, I highly recommend the dinan option for your BMW.  My dealership installed the dinan suspension package hence there was no warranty concerns.  The dinan package is more aggressive than the factory sports package and performed flawlessly.  

BMW has finally upgraded their audio systems and audiophiles are better catered to.  But if you still want to improve the sound further there are a lot of after market packages.  I chose the after market route and the result was remarkable.  Since the car has a lot of sound insulation you have a great platform to work with.  I spent 3000 dollars on my upgrade and the result was...WOW

In my original review below I might have been a little too harsh and reflecting back on around 3 years of ownership it was a pleasant experience.  After making the above changes it was mind blowing and attracted a steady stream of compliments.

ORIGINAL REVIEW - Feedback based on 15 months of ownership

Having recently messed up my ankle I find myself the victim of an involuntary house arrest, hence this review.

My father bought me a new 2000 328i loaded with most options for my 20th birthday and I wanted to detail my experiences so far. [Reading this paragraph now, well damn I come across as a spoilt immature rich kid; I leave it here to remind myself of what a prat I used to be a few years back ;)]

There are a few problems that are mainly inconveniences; nothing serious.  

The moon roof has a tendency to rattle from time to time.  I have tried getting it fixed several times with different levels of success.  The dealership was extremely helpful but after they had replaced the entire mechanism for the fourth time they told me BMW was redesigning some clip that would eventually cure the problem. They did manage to reduce it to a point where it was a non event.  

As for the stereo system it is average and most people won't notice it till the euphoria of owning their "beemer" comes down. The audio system including the more expensive HK system is worthless in the 2000 model year. HK should be ashamed to lend its name to this crap. 

The system does not really handle bass very well. I listen to R&B and the bass reproduction is below average.  The six disc cd changer is worth it. It does not skip and has performed well. Also the homelink garage device is nice.  It is fitted well, looks elegant and works fine.  

My windows would make squeaking sounds that was dealt with some sort of a silicone glue.  

Driving this car is a lot of fun and and taking winding roads is a rewarding proposition (SPORT PACKAGE CRITICAL). The famed BMW handling is missing in action without the sports package. This is a car you can look forward to driving if properly equipped. The acceleration from the engine is strong and it sounds very smooth.  Driving this car at high speeds (120 mph +) reveals a stable and solid machine.  The build quality not on the same level as uber reliable brands such as Lexus.  But the overall experience is satisfactory for a luxury brand.  

This is a car that requires more involvement from the driver than its competitors.  It makes you an active part of the driving experience via steering, road feel and other sensory feedback.  This does not mean it drives in a rough or crude fashion; far from it.  The whole experience is refined but it does not isolate you either.  

The interior is done in fine fashion; restrained luxury not excessive.  All the buttons work with great tactile feedback and seem very durable.  The quality level is generally high and there are no obvious low points in my opinion.  

The exterior of this car has presence, especially in silver with the windows tinted and some low profile tires.  The design looks like it won't be dated anytime soon.  The xenon lights are also a worthy option for night driving and aesthetics. 

I would recommend this as a solid piece of kit that deserves some serious consideration.
