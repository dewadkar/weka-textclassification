            {update}
My Z is now 9 months old and I'm still happy with my toy.  After living with a car for awhile, you can always see a few faults and these are the ones I've noticed.  The car's paint seems to scratch very easily. The car also centers all of it's weight over the front which occasionally makes it handle a little oddly.  There's very little weight over the rear driving wheels, so it can be a little squirrely.  Otherwise, it is still a joy to drive - especially in convertible weather!
{end update} 

I've had a 2000 BMW Z3 for about one week now.  For the un-initiated, this car was introduced in 1996 and made a movie appearance as Pierce Brosnan's Bond car.  The Z3 is not for the individual looking for solid transportation.  This car is a pure toy, it's fun, it's stylish, it makes head turns and can give you one heck of a sunburn.

My Z3 is an automatic (sorry, bad knees made it impossible for me to drive the 5-speed).  However, even for an automatic, driving it is pure pleasure.  You feel the road, the shift points are crisp and appropriate and the in-line 24-valve, 6-cylinder engine provides all the power a driver could want (even if the computer shuts you down to under 130 mph).  The car comes equipped with BMW's &quot;stability control,&quot; a nice feature for the foul weather driver, but not overly necessary in this two-seater convertible.  This is a car for sunny weather with the wind in your face.

Speaking of two-seats, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this car is small - it's not meant for the grand tour.  It's trunk might hold one carry-on size bag and a brief case, but not a whole lot more.  You can't get a regular set of golf-clubs in it either, although you might be able to squeeze in a flexible carry bag.  

The car's cockpit is basic and functional, but not overly fussy.  The gauges are analog, including the clock.  The sound system is quite adequate for the two-seater, easily heard even at 80mph on the freeway with the top down.  Mine came with a CD and the controls take a little study, but nothing too unusual for this class of automobile.  The leather seats are very comfortable and provide sufficient support and room for most individuals.  With the top up, the head room is sparse, so it might not be comfortable for you over 6-footers out there, but I'm a tall lady and I find it quite comfortable for me.  When the top is up, the cockpit is amazingly quiet.  Visibility is good, but one gets spoiled at having nearly 360 degree visibility in the top-down convertible.

When I decided I wanted a pleasure car, I looked into Volvo's convertible (great car, but pricey), the Mazda Miata (similar in size to the Z3), the Saab 9-3 convertible and the Z3.  Choosing a convertible is mostly done viscerally, not with the brain, but in comparing these four cars, the Z3 comes out on top as a great package.  The Volvo, as one would expect, is a terrific car, safe, quiet and very sound.  However, it's base price is $10,000 more than the Z3.  The Saab was fun, but the dealer wasn't convenient for me.  The Mazda lacked a lot in safety features, but was fun to drive.  What sold me on the Z3 was the quality of that &quot;German engineering&quot; (built by American auto workers in Spartanburg, SC) and the safety features and reputation of BMW.  The Z3 is equipped with roll bars, side impact as well as driver and passenger air bags, the traction control I already mentioned and a smooth, sexy appearance.   The top is very easy to take down with a convenient automatic control between the seats.  

[Sept. 17 update -- I added the rear wind deflector last weekend and I would consider it a worthy accessory.  It decreases the amount of turbulent wind re-entering the cockpit from the rear and makes higher speed driving quite comfortable, even in the fall weather we have been experiencing.  I still love this car.]

Some drawbacks to the car?  I already mentioned the small trunk and I really wish there was some sort of safe &quot;stowage&quot; compartment in the passenger compartment besides the glove box.  In a convertible, one does wish for a place to secure a few necessary items.  The car has a small, 13.1 gallon gas tank, but in my short experience thus far, I am getting better than 20 mpg in combination city and highway driving.  A great advantage with BMW these days is that all scheduled maintenance is covered in the cost of the car.

If you're in the market for a car that will turn heads, is loads of fun and not necessary for serious road trips, look into the Z3.<br><br>
