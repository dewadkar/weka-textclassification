            I have been driving my Chevy Corsica for the past four years...since it was brand new.  It's not a Ferrari but it takes me where I need to go and never gives me problems.  

I drive a 1994 Corsica with the optional V6 3.1 liter engine a must for this car.  It has suprisingly quick pick up and and it handles very well for a car that cost under $17,000(brand new).  I drive it back and forth from NYC to Albany for school every three weeks and the car works great.  If your the kind of driver who like to drive hard and be able to beat out most other cars off a red light than this car is for you...

As with every American car there are flaws(not that the Japanese cars don't have'em), one of them is that the fuel injection system on the 1994 was recalled for leaving a residue in the fuel lines which I had to experience first hand...cost me about $350.  I later learned that the dealership should have paid for it but who wants to be bothered with that crap..

Anyway for the money the car comes with power windows, locks, abs, air, remote keyless entry and a pretty decent stereo system (for a stock radio).  Overall I think the car is worth the money and it will take a beating for a good long time....<br><br>
