            I received a HP C200 digital camera for Christmas this year.  I have a HP Pavilion computer that I am very happy with.  The digital camera hasn't let me down in any way.  The quality of the pictures taken with this camera are wonderful.  It is fairly easy to use, but my only use complaint with this product is the hassle of switching from shooting mode to viewing mode.  Also even with an AC adapter the batteries drain like a bucket with holes.  Overall the camera has easy to follow instructions and simple menus.  I would suggest the user of this camera have a slight idea of what they are doing.  I wouldn't suggest this camera for the &quot;computer illiterate&quot;.  I'm continuing to be impressed with the products of Hewlett Packard and I give the company an A++ on this product.  <br><br>
