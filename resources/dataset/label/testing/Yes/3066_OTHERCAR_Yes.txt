            UPDATE:  I still have my baby, going on six years, and I'm still in love with it.  It's definitely the best car we've ever owned.  She's now got 117,000 miles on it and going strong.  

What have we had to replace?  The air conditioner condenser, which sits in front of the radiator, I assume it got a hole in it from a stone or something, and the water pump just went out, along with the belt tension regulator.  Pretty good for a car that has 117,000 miles on it.  

Overall, this is the absolute best car I have ever owned, and I will be very sad when we have to buy a new one, I don't want to get rid of her.

When we were in the market for a new car, I wanted to look at the Intrepid because I liked how they looked, sporty and a four door, and I'd heard good things about the car from friends.  We purchased the car in December of 1996, and have not had a disappointing moment with it since we've owned it.  There was one recall on the car for a fuel rail o-ring, it was taken care of promptly, of course at the expense of Dodge.  It was purchased as a demo model (8,000 miles when we purchased, now with over 68,000 miles), got an extremely good deal on the car.   The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the color, it's black.  Makes for a sharp looking car, but terrible to keep "clean".

This car has EVERYTHING in it.  All power, top of the line stereo, CD/cassette player, moon roof, overhead console giving information such as, estimated driving time, mileage, odometer, estimated miles per gallon, compass and temperature outside, climate control, cruise, tilt wheel, alarm system.  You name it, I think the car has it.

We travel a great deal, and I do 95% of the driving.  I love how this car handles.  It's very comfortable with the bucket leather seats, fully adjustable with lumbar support.  The back seat is very comfortable and roomy.  I feel that it gets fairly good gas mileage on trips, we can go about 400 miles on one full tank.  I like how the controls for the stereo and heater are positioned, in my car they are tilted towards the driver for better access.

I really can't say enough good things about my Intrepid.  It's truly a great car.  I feel you get MORE than what you pay for in this Dodge model.
