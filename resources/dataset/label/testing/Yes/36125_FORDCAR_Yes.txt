            I was looking for a new car, and I have to admit my inexperience dealing
with car-sales people. I basically paid around 1200 dollars more if I had done my homework right. However, the car has performed admirably for the past 6 months. The controls are easy to read and reach, no squeaky noises so far and about 24MPG with a Z-Tec engine. Overall I really like the car and I would buy it again. That is if you are planning to use it along with only one other person. 

The back seats are comfortable only for kids, even though the presence of a middle safety belt imply that it could be a 5 passenger car. NO WAY, unless they are small children. Also the ZX3 is the hatchback version of the Focus. The radio antenna is placed on the roof in a pretty neat looking position. But you will need to live with the bumping of the antenna to the roof every time you use an automated car wash, the wind during the drying cycle pushing the antenna really makes you wish to get out of the carwash as soon as possible.

My previous car was a VW golf, and I really got used to the very precise manual transmission. I had problems adjusting to my new Focus' gearbox, and I have really hurt it a couple of times when changing gears. Unless you are a stick shift fan I would recommend an automatic, but then buying a ZX3 does not make much sense since it is supposed to be &quot;sporty&quot;. Also my VW Golf had a quieter ride compared to the cabin noise in my Focus on coarse surfaces.

The trunk is roomy enough and you can make more space by moving the rear passenger seat to the front. This is again proof that this car is basically a 2 passenger.

Also because of the shape of the car, the visibility to the back of the car is not ideal and the blind spot behind and to the left of the driver are quite large. You really need to use the all the mirrors all the time to be on the safe side.
