            The Mercedes-Benz E430 is one of Mercedes &quot;under-performers&quot;(along with the ML320). It has many weak points such as its steering.

<b>The Interior:</b>

      	The interior is about the only good thing about this car. The back seat can fit two average sized adults. The seats are made of full grain leather and they are comfortable for long road trips. The front two seats are slightly more comfortable. The dash is well organized and everything is easily accessible. They could have reduced the interior noise a little bit more. There are also the usual standard feature, power windows, locks, etc. This car has some of the most practical safety features in it's class.

<b> The Engine/Specs/Handling : </b> 
 When driving the E430 it feels like you get disconnected from the road. Turning sharp corners is difficult. The suspension is the worst I have seen in a Mercedes. But there is some good. It has all of the Luxury, safety, and build quality that you can expect in a Benz. Besides that is what really matters in the long haul right? This car isn't going to provide you 0-60mph crazy cronies. The E430 engine: The E430 has a 275hp V-8. It is a rear wheel drive car with hydraulic assisted ABS brakes. 

<b> The Clich�: </b>
 The E430 is a car with luxury and safety but lacks style and pizzazz. Don�t get me wrong the E430 is good but not the best (The Lexus GS400, now that�s a car). I think Mercedes needs to go back to the drawing board.
