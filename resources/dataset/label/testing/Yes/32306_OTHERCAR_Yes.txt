            I have had the Nissan Sentra SE Limited for 6 months now and it is really nice. Everything is standard, cd, sunroof, alloy wheels, cruise, and spoiler...Awesome price for what you get. I was also looking at the civic before buying the Sentra, but the civic costs a lot more and the engine isn�t nearly as good. The Sentra SE comes with standard 150hp. It gives you a smooth ride; overall the car is perfect for someone with budget of 15000. This car beats all cars in the price range. If you aren�t looking for car that looks the greatest, but is the best value. This car has a weird shape, but the look will grow on you!!!
