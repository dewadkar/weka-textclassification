            I was just recently given a 96 mazda B2300 truck. Now I am not going to make any serious complaints about the car because I did not have to pay one cent for it, but I will tell ya about it. It has a 2.3L I4 engine rated at just under 100 h.p. While this is enough to get around in, do not expect to tow or haul a lot of things. It simply does not have the power. However, it is capable if you play your cards right of getting 600 miles out of one tank of gas on the highway. Which works aout to about 30 mpg highway, and 24 city. Pretty darn good for a truck. Mine is a cab plus SE with the optional handling package, and while it does tend to lean a bit more than normal, its 225/75/14 all terain tires have a sure grip on the road. on the highways it has a little bit of a struggle to get up to speed, but once at 65-70 mph. it will stay there all day long! Mine is Manual and it is a five speed, but I rarley use fifth gear unless I am crusing on the highway, if I want to pass, I have to down shift to forth gear. Not a big hassle, but something ya gotta do. Seats are very comfy and supportive, but the two jumper seats (pull out seats in the back of the cab, are pretty small and uncomfortable. But more than enough for short trips, really short trips. Thge stereo/tape player is good, with 4 speakers, and heat blows very hot air. I really don't have to many complaints about this truck, it gets its job done, and makes for good affordable little truck <br><br>
