            This is definitely one of the funnest cars to drive. Very quick on it's toes whether it's going forward, stopping, or turning. Because of it's rarity not everyone has seen one and those who know of it's potential are just drooling when they see one.
Handles like nothing else I know. Perfect 50/50 weight balance. But the reliability... ugh. Engines last about 70k miles, and cost about $2500. Require tons of care and a good chunk of money. But when it runs right, oh yeah!! Take it out on a twisty road and you'll fall in love!

Strengths: Very rare and gorgeous car and attracts a lot of attention. Has a perfect blend of speed and handling for it's price. Extremely fun to drive.

Weaknesses: Hard ride, but you get used to it. Slightly higher maintenance cost. Hard to find mechanic with experience in rotary engines. Engines run very hot.
