                 i just bought a 2004 liberty renegade, despite reading some not so positive reviews about it. I just love the thing! I could not be any happier.  I was looking for a capable 4-wheel drive vehicle that is reasonably priced, looks good, and is comfortable...and thats exactly what I got, a rare occurence in todays market.  The power is more than adequate, its no ferrarri on the highway, but if thats even an issue you should'nt be looking at suv's.  Its not as "cushy" as most other suv's, but it is surprisingly smooth for a jeep, if you dont mind the "jeep bounce" then you'lle love the liberty.  In my opinion, its a beautiful looking car in and out...so why all the negative reviews?  ill tell you why!  its because people are getting too spoiled today! they dont realize that not every suv on the market performs like a high end mercedes or BMW.  And that a large 4-wheel drive vehicle is going to use more gas then a honda civic.  And what little you sacrifice in comfort, you more then make up for in off-road performance.  All in all, you're getting more then what you pay for in a liberty, more rugged then anything else in its class...by far, an excellent and very versatile 4 wheel drive system, and all in a very attractive package.  Just keep in mind, you're spending your money on axles, transfer cases, and performance oriented features.  Not ashtrays, coin holders, and glove compartments that can fit books and maps...its the new millenium people! lose the maps and spend less then 100 bucks on a good gps!!  
     So if you're looking for an suv thats not huge, decent on gas, and can actually go off-roading without breaking, then look no further then the jeep liberty! It truly is a great car that will deliver more then you expected from it. And if you're the type of person who's concerned with what does or doesnt fit in the glove compartment, then jeep is definitely not for you.  I am, or was, a die-hard import fan...never owned a domestic until the liberty, i was skepticle about it, but upon doing my research i found that there was simply nothing that even compared to the liberty offered by the import market for the same price range.  Even higher priced larger suv's did not have nearly as impressive a list of off-road features as the liberty.  In conclusion, when you research what you're about to spend a good chunk of your hard earned money on, make sure you focus on whats underneath the liberty; axles, transfer case, differentials, and traction , because thats where the liberty shines.  Its one of the last "true off-road" suv's left. The rest of them are just oversized station wagons!
