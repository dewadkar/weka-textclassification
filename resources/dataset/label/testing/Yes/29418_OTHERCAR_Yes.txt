                 Remaining true to the Porsche tradition, the Boxter S mixes luxury reliability, and comfort with power and performance.  Furthermore, its sleek design will undoubtably catch the eye of any passerby.  The styling, however, is not just a fashion statement, but an excellent example of how form fits function.  Its smooth aerodynamic shape slips through the air with precision while reducing drag and increasing grip.
     The Boxter S is a suped-up version of the original Boxter which debuted in 1997.  For 2000, the no-suffix Boxter displaces 2.7 liters, encompasses a torque of 192 lb-ft, and comes with 217hp, while the &quot;S&quot; increases displacement to 3.2 liters, raises torque to225 lb-ft, and contains the power of 250 horses.  What does that all mean?  It translates to a 0-60mph time of 5.2 seconds, a quarter mile in 13.8 seconds reaching 101 mph, and a top speed of 162 mph for the Boxter S, greatly surpassing the performance of the already exceptional Boxter.
     Power alone, however, is not what makes the Boxter S so superb.  Its safety systems, such as four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and a highly advanced traction control system give the driver complete control and confidence.  In fact, recent tests show that its roadholding capabilities slaughtered that of the competition, beating cars such as the Chevrolet Corvette Convertible, the Mercedes-Benz SLK230, and the BMW M Roadster (Car and Driver test results).
     Like any Porsche, the Boxter S is more than just a sports car, it is a sports luxury car.  Within the cockpit you will find plush leather seats, a great audio system, and an optional global positioning system.
     Unfortunatly, the back window of the sofftop is plastic, which looks to cheap for a car starting at $51,430.  For those of you who can't afford such a lofty price I recommend looking at the standard Boxter or the Audi TT Quattro.<br><br>
