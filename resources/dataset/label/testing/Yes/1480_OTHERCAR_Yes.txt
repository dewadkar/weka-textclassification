            I purchased my V6 Cougar almost 3 weeks ago and enjoy driving it. The engine is quiet but smooth and powerful. The car regularly wants to drive 80-85 mph on the highway without prompting. I chose the manual transmission and do not recommend the automatic. The automatic takes away too much of the 'fun factor.'

The interior is nicely laid out for the most part. The controls are easy to use, although the stick shift can get in the way of the radio presets (I have the in-dash 6-CD changer).  There is really only one usable cup holder, and it's not for "Big Gulps."  The second cup holder is hidden under the center arm rest/console.

The driver's seat is comfortable and the power seat options are a must, in my opinion.  The lack of a lumbar support on the passenger's seat is quite noticeable.  As previously mentioned, the headrests should tilt like on the Cougar's 2nd cousins, the Contour/Mystic. This car is made for single people or couples - not families - and as such the rear seats are for short commutes or your pets. The rear seats do fold nearly flat and make lots of cargo room.  The hatch is a little heavy, but opens high to accommodate large items.  The hatch lip is a bit high so you will have to lift your groceries a couple extra inches and make your dog jump high to get them in. Not a problem, I think, for the demographic most likely to by a Cougar.

The HVAC system is quick to warm and, I assume, quick to cool (It's still too cold in Wisconsin to use AC).  The blower fan is a little noisy when set high, but it does a good job of moving the cabin air.  I wish they had a button to switch from fresh to recycled air w/out having to switch the controls to Max AC.  This is important if you're driving past a dump or oil-belching car.

I purchased the premium sound system with the in-dash 6 CD changer and am pretty happy with it. I think I will add a couple tweeters because the sound is a little 'bassy.' The cabin is fairly quiet, so I doubt you'll need to worry about an extra amp unless you like to go 'BOOM, BOOM, BOOM' down the road.

Road handling is very good. There is good road feel through the steering, which is slightly heavy but typical for a sports car. (Note: One of the things I didn't like about the Alero was the very Oldsmobile soft-power steering.)  The Cougar holds the road nicely and I can take the local clover leaf on/off ramp faster than most cars - I like that!  The ride is on par for a sports car, stiffer and a little bumpier than the Contour, but not as bad as the Eclipse.

I like the exterior styling and get lots of looks from other motorists. Unfortunately, they are gawking at the car and not me.

My test drives included the Jetta V6 GLX, Passat, Eclipse GT, the Impreza WRX & Outback, Alero V6, Acura CL, and Grand Prix GTP.  All of the above have their strong points, but when I sat down and looked at how much I could get (features & ride) for my money, I chose the Cougar.

If you are looking for an affordable coupe with good handling, take a look at the V6 Cougar.
