            This car has had problems since day one. The seals on the windows do not keep rain water out. I have taken it to the dealer numerous times for repair to no avail. GM went so far as to say they would not pay for the repair and I would have to pay for the repair then be reimbursed. The leakage has been so bad the flooring in the back seat is constantly wet.  The passenger side window has gotten water into the motor and has caused an electrical problem. I have been in constant contact with GM however they refuse to admit the car is a Lemon and the dealership keeps giving me excuses, at times even trying to blame me for the problem. I am fed up with this car and GM even though I really like the vehicle. As the adage goes LET THE BUYER BEWARE! If you have a vehicle manufacturers are not willing to readily take the vehicle off your hands.<br><br>
