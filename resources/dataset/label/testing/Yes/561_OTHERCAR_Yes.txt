            I got this car as my first car. Its a great first car! It a sky blue color has an automatic transmission (Usually Manual is standard) 4 doors and pretty roomy for its size.

The car rides nice, comes with heat, air vents. Not Automatic windows or locks but you can live without them.

The car can come in many different colors, you can visit Hyundai's website to see them (hyundai-usa.com) Gas to Mileage is pretty good, I only throw $10 in every so often.

On the high way, the car handles good, I use it for going to school 1 hour away from home on highway, and once you get the car going, your good. At first it takes a bit for it to pick up. 

Its a good family car, theres definatly room in the front, and the back can fit 2 adults, or 3 kids easily. 

Its a great little car!
