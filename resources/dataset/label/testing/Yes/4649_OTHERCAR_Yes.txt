            We were in a very small Chevrolet s-10 pickup when we decided to move into a bigger car..  I am not a big fan of mini-vans, and fell in love with the cute Chevrolet cavalier.  We bought our 96 model brand new from the Chevrolet dealer near our home. It has been a great car for our family of four, with plenty of room for two car seats and an extra person in the backseat.  The gas mileage has been great and we can go for nearly a week on a full tank of gas.  One downfall of the car is that the window controls are in the middle console, and there are none on the front doors.  This makes it easily accessible for any number of accidents to happen and damage the controls, with no alternative for rolling the windows up and down.  We have had our car for four years now and it has not had to go into the shop for repairs.  It is very easy to handle and smooth riding.  This is a great car for a wide variety of people with different needs.  The two door version would be great for a small family, college student or single person.  And the four door version, such as I have is great for a family of 4-5.  Overall,  it has been a great car for our family.    <br><br>
