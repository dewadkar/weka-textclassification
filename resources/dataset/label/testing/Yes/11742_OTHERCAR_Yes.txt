            We bought this car for the same reason many people do -- space. The paraphernalia that surrounds two little boys could not be confined in a mere Honda Civic station wagon any longer. We needed space.

Once we decided on the idea of a minivan, there wasn't much else to look at. At the time, only Dodge had sliding doors on both sides and no one else made everything fit inside as intelligently as Dodge did. Even now, I think few manufacturers have caught up to the Caravan, with its easily removable rows of seats, flat floor and well-laid out cabin.

The only thing I don't like about it is unavoidable. It drives like a small bus, because it is one, I guess. I'm used to small, sporty, good-handling cars, and a minivan is none of the above. The steering is floaty and it's not the most precise handler.

But for a family car, it's just fine. There's room for everything and everyone and it's reliable. It does the job.<br><br>
