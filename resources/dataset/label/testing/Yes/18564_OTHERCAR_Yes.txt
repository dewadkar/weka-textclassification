            I got my QV-8000SX for Christmas 2000.  I bought it through a Yahoo Auction for about $350.  I previously owned a Mavica FD91, which I also loved, but found it a bit large and bulky for toting along with me on our nature walks.  So, I began searching the web (and spent a lot of time here on Epinions) for a smaller but equally functional digital camera.  This was not an easy task!!  It seems that most of the compact digital cameras have little or no zoom capability.  If you are like me and enjoy taking pictures of nature, then you know how important a good zoom is for this purpose.  A compact digital camera with only 2X or 3X optical zoom would not suffice on nature walks where I hoped to catch a picture of a deer or whatever other wildlife I might come across.
After considerable searching, I found the Casio QV-8000SX.  But, apparently this camera has been discontinued as I could never locate in a local store.  But, I did find one on a Yahoo auction and was absolutely thrilled when I won the auction for $350.  Of course, I won't deny I was a bit nervous about sending $350 for an auction item, but I was lucky this time and ended up dealing with a reputable seller and I got a great camera!!
Th Casio QV-8000SX digital camera is one item which I can not understand why anyone would rate anything other than recommended.
Here are some of the items I love about this camera.  First of all, it is the only digital camera (at least as of December 2000) which is compact in size and has an 8X optical 4X digital zoom lens.  And, the lens system works GREAT.  It has manual and automatic exposure.  It has several settings for the flash, including a forced flash, a forced "no flash",  a red eye reduction and automatic.  The flash can also be set for intensity, strong, normal or weak.  You can choose shutter speed or aperture priority for manual settings.  It has a choice of spot metering (something I really like for those backlit subjects), center or multi metering.  It can take panoramas (although I haven't tried this feature yet).  It has a timer (so that you can include yourself in the picture).  It also has time lapse photography (although I haven't tried this yet either).  It has a movie option, which I have used often.  Unfortunately, the movies are in AVI format and not MPEG.  Also, there is no sound to the movies.  It uses CompactFlash memory cards.  I bought a 128 and 192 Mbyte memory card and oh, how wonderful compared to the Mavica.  My Mavica (the one thing I did not like about it, in addition to its size) could only hold maybe (if you were lucky) 12-13 photos on a floppy disk, but the CompactFlash memory cards are amazing.  Although I have always download my pics into my computer before filling  up the card, the 192 Mbyte card holds over 200 photos!!  Oh, I also purchased a card reader.  I highly recommend this.  I think the card reader cost about $39 from Best Buy, it is a SanDisk card reader.  It works great and with the reader, the memory cards act just like a floppy disk.
The pictures look great and I have printed out 8X10s which I have framed and posted on the wall.
The one thing that I really do not like about the QV-8000SX is that it does not have a viewfinder, only an LCD screen.  So, if it is sunny outside, it is practically impossible to see what it is you are trying to photograph.  I bought a piece of equipment called "Hoodman" which is a shade for the LCD screen.  Although the "Hoodman" helps, it is still very hard to see the image you are trying to photograph in bright sunlight.  I guess nothing is ever perfect and I knew before I bought this camera that this would be a problem.  But, since the 8X optical zoom was the most important thing to me, I decided to go ahead and purchase the QV-8000SX and live with the LCD screen.
Another rather negative feature is the battery life (battery life seems to be around 100 pictures, but this varies a lot depending on how long the LCD screen is left on), but I use Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries so I really don't have a big problem with this.  However, you might want to always carry a fully charged spare set of batteries with you on the road.  
As a whole, I love my QV-8000SX and use it exclusively (even though I also have a Mavica FD91).
