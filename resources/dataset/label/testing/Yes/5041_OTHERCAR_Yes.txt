                 Coming out with the 2001 Eclipse Spyder, Mitsubishi may have the best sports car for under $25,000 out there on the market, with it's bold new look you can't beat the price that it will sell for.


<b><i>Appearance</b></i>     

     The look of the car is based on the new Mitsubishi design where it's &quot;geo-mechanical&quot; styling is put into full effect especially on the car's bold fenders, a hood swell, and horizontal strakes across the doors.  This car's look definitely exceeds the price.  It is offered in 2 shades of red, shades of white, gray and black.  It's interior colors are black and tan.


<b><i>Price</b></i>    

     Speaking of the price, it is very easy to swallow for a car of this caliber.  The GS starts out at $23,347.  A base GT which features 200-hp will cost $25,237 and the fully loaded GT will be just under $29,000.  It is definitely an affordable convertible and worth it's price.


<b><i>Engine</b></i>

     The Eclipse GT will feature a V6 3.0 liter engine that produces 200 horsepower which is more then enough for the average person.  It's little brother, the GS will feature a fairly powerful engine.  It's four-cylinder engine will put forth 147 horsepower, which I feel is enough acceleration for a small car such as the Eclipse which is listed at around 3,000 lbs.


<b><i>Features</b></i>

     The 2001 Eclipse Spyder offers a revised suspension, with large-diameter front struts, a strut tower brace and a multi-link rear suspension containing stronger steel arms.  A stiffer frame and a longer wheelbase is featured by the 2001 model as well.  There are also some safety improvements over last year's model as well.  

     Power windows and locks are standard along with an anti-theft system, CD Player, 16&quot; wheels, cruise control, remote keyless entry, and much more.  Stepping up to the GT will give you the of course bigger engine and the 17&quot; wheels, improved brakes and wider tires.

     The car also features a automanual transmission, where a driver can change gears without a clutch.  I have never seen anything like this before, so you can get more acceleration out of your vehicle shifting like a manual but without the pain of using a clutch.  


<b><i>The Bad Points</b></i>

     There are some questions that have arose about this car.  Traction control is offered only with the GT w/ an automatic transmission, it is not offered with a manual transmission.  The buyers of the GS model cannot get anti-lock brakes.  

     Also, the trunk space in this car is very limited so it may not be a good choice for people who carry a lot of things with them, or a stereo junkie that needs room for subwoofers.  There also is a moderate amount of road noise and no turbo motor featured.


<b><i>Overall</b></i>

     I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a stylish convertible and doesn't want to pay 40 or 50 thousand for one.  Ranging from 23,000 to 29,000 this is a pretty affordable car.  I would recommend this car with two thumbs up.  The Eclipse isn't perfect, but it's getting closer each year.
