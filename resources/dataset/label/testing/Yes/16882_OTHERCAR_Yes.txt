            I visited my Mom recently and while I was there she showed me her latest toy, the Sony MVC-FD95 digital camera. Mom has been a professional photographer for 30+ years and really knows her stuff when it comes to camera equipment.

The Sony MVC is a fantastic camera. As I looked over all of the features I was really impressed with the way Sony made the camera so light (by comparisons) with some of the other cameras of its frame type. It is heavier than some of the other models available on the market but I found the weight to be balanced and comfortable in my hands. One handed use was easy since all the key buttons are within a finger or thumb distance away from where I held it.

The camera�s best feature by far in my opinion is the 20x zoom lens that I found to be very effective at getting close-ups from a distance. I was able to stand in Mom�s backyard and look at things far away like they were right next to me. The second best feature is the fact that the camera uses standard floppy discs to store pictures. I thought this was a fantastic idea from Sony.

I looked at the manual for a few minutes and found out that the battery should last you up to or right around 200 images per charge. A neat feature is the fact that you can use the camera while the battery is charging. I took a few pictures with the camera saving them to disc and when I saw them on my computer I was more than pleased with the resolution and vivid colors that the image produced. 

I found the LCD screen to be very good giving an accurate frame of what your picture will look like. I am hoping to borrow the camera form Mom for an upcoming trip, hopefully getting some fantastic shots while I am away. I guess it will all depend on whether or not Mom is willing to loan her new $1200 toy to her little boy. Cross your fingers for me.

The little experience that I have with the Sony MVC-FD95 doesn�t deter me from highly recommending the camera for anyone that wants professional pictures from their digital camera, ease of use, and dependability. Mom loves it, I love it, I am willing to bet that you will love it too.
