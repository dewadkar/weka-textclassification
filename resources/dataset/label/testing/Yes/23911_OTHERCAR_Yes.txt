            For buyers who urge more &quot;me&quot; than &quot;me too&quot; will surely appreciate the bold statement that the Audi TT makes. The exotic and areodynamic styling of the new coupe expresses futuristic and retroistic values as I couldn't  keep my eyes off of all the aluminum rings bolted down with Allen screws.
Step inside, then the amazement continues as plastic, leather, fabric, and just the right amount of aluminum blend forming one of the best designed interiors I 've ever seen.  Every control is one touch away from the driver, everything placed perfectly in place. For example, the climate controls work so well and neatly as the knob springs back in position after setting the climate control.  Other than superior design elements, this car has awesome handling as it gives you a locked to the ground sensation when throwing the car into a quick turn or a curvy mountain road. Acceleration is good with its turbocharged 4 cylinder engine which pushes 180hp at 5500rpm.  The brakes? smooth and responsive, closely matching Porsche class distances.  If you have a thing for sports cars then definetly get a test drive of this car if you haven't already done so.  Just shift the gear into first and blast off like the true car enthusiest that you really are.  The TT isn't meant for the race tracks, just for driving quickly down a curvy country road while attracting the eyes of the public filled with amazement.
