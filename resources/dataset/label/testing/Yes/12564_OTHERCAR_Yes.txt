            I've owned one each of the C4 era best of the breed:  1989 six speed L98, 1990 ZR-1, 1996 LT4, and now the VERY best yet, a 2002 Corvette Z06 with torch red seats.  

Bought it new (out of State) at a great price, $46,988, and got GMAC to finance a 2.9% loan.  Payment are still rather high for the working class.  For the performance, this is a world class bargain and the most B-4-B currently available.  Barr none.    

The really great thing about this car, remenicent of the (former) King of the Hill ZR-1, is it's dual personality.  At light throttle, just like any other ordinary car, smooth, quiet, good gas mileage, nice stereo, etc, etc.

Drop the hammer and WOW!!!  Just like a ride in the Space Shuttle at liftoff.  Truly amazing acceleration.  GM rates it 3.9 seconds zero to 60, 12.4 seconds in the SS quarter mile, with a trap speed of 116 mph.  For a 50 state legal, 28 mpg (highway), all modern luxury features standard, that's right up there with the six figure Italiano super exotics.   

Just to be sure I recently put it on a Dynojet system to independently determine how much the exclusive to Z06, LS6 engine truly has . . . 360+ rwhp and 348+ rwt.  A tad bit more than a ZR-1, with 400 pounds less car weight to push through the air.  Oh man, what a driving machine!

Any gripes?  A few.  All minor, or certainly excusable for this kind of performance at this low of a price.  

In the interest of saving a few pounds of weight, there is no way to lower the rear mounted antenna mast.  I just unscrewed it an leave in the trunk.  I listen to CDs most of the time anyway.  Problem solved.  :-)

The only significant problem I've experienced so far, after 8 months and 3400 miles, is a sporadic anomally with the fuel tank level dash readout.  Sometimes, out of the blue, the fuel gauge suddenly drops to zero and a low fuel warning displays on the digital readout in the dash.  Rather disconcerting, but seems to clear itself by the next day, even before refilling the tank.  Nevertheless, because of this, I tend to use the trip odometer between fill ups and keep a close eye on the miles remain on the "range" readout.

Everything else about this car is to die for.  Only have the utmost praise to offer.  Oh, one more little nit to pick, but a small price to pay for the best ABS brakes on an American made sports car.  The front disc pads wear rather quickly and throw off brake dust all over the front alloy wheels.  Needless to say frequent trips to the do-it-yourself carwash is more than an occasional necessity.

The Z06 is the hardtop (fix roof coupe) model for better structural rigidity and handling.  Less body weight too compared to the standard model (350hp) coupe.  The Z06 rear window is much smaller which saves weight.  An added bonus is the presence of an honest to goodness lockable "trunk" shared with the convertible model.  A bit of an oddity perhaps in such a high performance car, but that's where any similarity to drop top model ends.  

Even Z06's OEM tires scream "SUPERCAR"!  In fact, that is exactly the same word embossed on each side wall, and they are "Y" speed rated tires to boot.  The agressive looking, ultra high performance Goodyear tires, and the functional cooling ducts integrated into the body styling for both front and rear brakes, tells the casual observer the "Z06 405HP" badges gracing the hood, are the real deal.

Pop the hood and the first thing that you see are those striking fire engine red "beauty" (valve) covers on each side of the engine.  Nice touch.  The LS6 desigated, all aluminum, high compression, high lift cam, OHV V-8 engine looks like a work of art.  It is the best example of "tried and proven".  The small block Chevy is a throw back to the past, but has evolved over near five decade to the its most modern reincarnation in the LS6.  Just goes to show that "hot rodding" is still alive and well at the dawning of the 21st century. 

Straight ahead is the 50th anniversary of Corvette and 2003 promises to be a spectacular celebration of the marque, a true American icon.  I'm already raring to go, in my Z06, and looking forward to the party.
