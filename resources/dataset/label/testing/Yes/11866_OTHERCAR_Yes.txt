            I did a lot of research before purchasing this car. I compared all the cars in its class and I think this was the best car based on my criteria.  I wanted a safe and economical car that was environmentally sound.  

The Civic is a best pick by the Insurance Institute because of its excellent performance in their offset crash-test.  Many cars that score well on the Government's tests fail miserably on the Insurance Industry's more punishing test. Make sure you get one with side air-bags. It only adds $250 to the price of the car and, as they will soon be standard on all cars, they will help retain its resale value later on. 

I found that while the Civic costs more up front to purchase, the savings in fuel costs and insurance make up for it's higher sticker price after about 5 years of service. Also Honda's generally maintain a high resale value.

The mileage this car gets is superb.  It averages about 35mpg and this helps it achieve its ULEV (Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) status. You can always have the piece of mind that you are being much easier on the environment than most others.

The interior is fantastic. The dash layout is simple but high quality and high class.  The seats are comfortable and the front headroom is excellent for those over six feet. The floor in the rear has not hump in the middle. It's perfectly flat and this provides more comfort for a fifth passenger.

My only complaint about the car is that rough roads make for a rough ride.  The Hyundai Elantra is similar in size but they managed to create a supple suspension.

That one drawback, however, has not made me regret my decision.  I have had not second thoughts or "buyer's remorse" regarding the purchase of this car.
