            Just bought an Altima 3.5 SE, black, with all the options.  This car is just great.  I did a lot of research on the car before buying, and had seem mostly positive reviews, but a few negative ones.  Well, I'm not sure what these people are complaining about when they mention the "unrefined interior", the "jittery ride", or the lack of illumination on steering-wheel mounted audio and cruise controls (can you not remember the position of a couple of buttons?!)

So far this car handles great, very smooth and quiet ride, good build quality, great power, lots of room, and very comfortable.  Excellent stereo too.  The exterior is beautiful, have already gotten numerous compliments on it, people just stop and stare.

Bottom line is that so far I love the car.  Granted it only has 500 miles on it now, so I'll post an update in a few months.  My advice would be BUY ONE.  Way nicer looking and faster than Accord or Camry, just as comfortable to me (I test drove them all), maybe a bit more money but worth it.

Update 4/1/02:
So far the car is still great!  2300 miles and not a single thing wrong, still VERY smooth ride, no squeaks or rattles, minimal wind noise, and lots of power.  It's gone on a couple of 3 hour trips and performed perfectly.  Getting about 24 mpg, which is pretty good.  Compliments come from every direction.  Still can't figure out what these people are talking about when they say it has a jittery ride or that there is lots of noise...were they driving a Lexus before?  Bottom line, so far I LOVE this car.  Highly recommended!

Update 5/22/02:
The car has about 4200 miles on it, and it still looks and behaves beautifully.  Not much more to add to the previous update, just thought I'd let folks know that the car is holding up well a few months into my ownership.  Driving it is STILL a BLAST.

Update 8/21/02:
Now at 9500 miles, and I am still very pleased with car, by far the best car I have ever owned.  Still no squeaks or rattles, road noise is nice and low (I've taken it on several 400+ mile trips at this point).  Engine is holding up great, the power is all still there.  No complaints and I'd still recommend this car highly.
