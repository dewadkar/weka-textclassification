            I am 5'2 and my husband is 6'1.  I needed a vehicle that was comfortable  to drive and had everything that we wanted.  I wanted a nice looking vehicle with 4 doors, a lot of room, comfortable for me or my husband to drive, ABS brakes and a large trunk.  My husband wanted power everything, the 6 liter engine with keyless entry and the cd player. We looked at several vehicles on the internet including the Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus.  In order to get what we wanted, we would have had to order a lot of extras or the more expensive models. By the time we went to the actual dealerships to negotiate for different vehicles, we figured out that it was actually cheaper for us to get the Nissan Maxima due to their willing to negotiate and the fact that almost everything was standard. They were also the friendliest dealer that we had dealt with. The internet was able to provide us with the dealer invoice and the fact that we came in prepared and knowing what we wanted saved us when it came to negotiating.
This car is incredible.
It drives smooth and it has a lot of power. It is very comfortable for all passengers and my husband actually offers to go places for me so he can drive it. He barely ever drove the BMW that we had before.  
If you go Warehouse shopping (Costco or Sams club) like I do, there is plenty of room in the trunk.  Everything about this vehicle is nice.
I would recommend this vehicle to any individual, especially ones with children, who want the most for their money.
I love this car!<br><br>
