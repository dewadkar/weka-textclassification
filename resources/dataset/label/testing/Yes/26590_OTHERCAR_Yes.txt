            I bought this car in 1993 because I wanted a &quot;sports car&quot;. I had never heard of the Allante, until my son who is a car buff told me about this fantastic car.  Test drove it and I have been hooked ever since.  Even though this car is now 10 years old, whenever I drive it people look and stare.  This car has great performance, style and speed.  The only drawback I have found is that the top is mechanical so that if it begans to rain you have to stop and put up the top manually.  But if you are like me I normally out run the rain and always make it home.  When you get in this car it is like getting into the cock pit of an airplane.  The seats hug you and you feel completely protected.  I have a 94 Mercedes but his is my car of choice when I want to have fun.<br><br>
