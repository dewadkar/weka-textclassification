            The 2001 Hyundai Tiburon is a great auto, but as with all things there is a toss up of price/functionality. For under $15,000 the Tiburon is a good deal. Now don't expect to get the handling characteristics of a Porsche, but do expect to be a little surprised when you feel how well it handles. There are some things that you should know about this particular vehicle. If you decide to purchase one, spend the extra money and get vent visors. Otherwise when the window is open, even an inch the rain will pour in directly onto the electrical controls on the door. Also the front windshield tends to fog quite a bit. Evidently the manufacturer knows about this because the Tiburon came with a tag stating how to de-fog the window. Now the car goes fast and smooth, but the engine lacks some horsepower. Getting up to speed should be much quicker for a car of this type. Lastly the car is a little noisy. Running around town isn�t bad, but during a long trip the engine noise can really start to bother you. Now if you plan on buying this vehicle here are a few tips. HAGGLE HAGGLE HAGGLE. They may tell you that there isn�t a markup on the car but there is. You should be able to get the Tiburon for about $14200. Also there are several accessories you can get cheaper elsewhere. The CD player upgrade is ridiculously expensive; get a better one for cheaper at a stereo store. The floor mats are about $70! But other than the above few things I have found lacking in this car, its still a great buy with quite possibly one of the best warranties around (10yr 100,000 mi drive train - 5yr 60,000mile bumper to bumper) Test drive the car and hopefully you�ll like it, I did.
