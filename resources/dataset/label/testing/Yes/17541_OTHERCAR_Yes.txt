            My car is actually called an Asuna Sunfire, but it is exactly the same as the Impulse. Izuzu made the Impulse until 92 and then in 93 the exact same model got changed to Asuna Sunfire. All the features are the same as well. 

Anyways, if your looking for a newer great little sports car that doesn't cost too much i recommend my car. All other sports cars in this year are pricy and this model has more features and great looks than the other sports cars. You like to drive fast and own the road? You can in this model. The car has Lotus handling! Just whip around the corners with ease!
It accelerates fast and is really good on gas. I just took it on a 12 hour road trip and the whole ride was as smooth as can be. Always a smooth ride never shakes when you hit top speeds and goes over bumps no problems. 

Since i bought this car i have had no hard complaints about it... sure you maybe have to bring it to the shop but dont you have to with all used cars anyways?

One extra little thing that is great about this model is that you don't see them too much on the road so it's not like your driving a civic around that you see every 2 mins!<br><br>
