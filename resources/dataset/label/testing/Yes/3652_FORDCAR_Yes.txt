            this car is great if you want a semi-luxury car with a nice tag- a nice price tag that is!  Police have been relying n the crown vic for years now, and it never disappoints.  The car runs great at 35 on the downtown roads, and even better at 85 on those ten lane freeways!  The car is pretty big, so you should be comfortable driving a car.  I'm 6&quot;3 and 380 pounds and I feel very comfortable driving this car.  The gas mileage is about 19 miles to the gallon, and the motor is 6horsepower genuine American motor!  Take a hint from the cops, this car rocks!
