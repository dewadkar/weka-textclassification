            I purchased my 1994 Saturn SL2 in Oct of '93.  I had heard a lot of good things about Saturn since it had hit the market just a few years before.  I can only add more great comments!

The dealership where I bought my car was wonderful.  They were not pushy at all, yet let the cars sell themselves.  I have been to other dealerships and yes, this seems to be a trait throughout the Saturn community.  

I have had just a few contacts with the service dept of various Saturn dealerships (I guess because its such a great car and rarely needed servicing!), but each time I experienced the same great service Saturn is known for.  My car presently has 120,000 miles on it and other than minor tuneups (plugs, wires, etc), the only thing I've had done is brakes about a year ago and a few months ago there was a short in the electrical system that had to be fixed.  

Everyone that has ever driven my car absolutely loves the way it handles.  The only complaint I've ever had is from men who say they wish it had a bit more room, but I understand that the new Saturn has taken care of that too.  I'm a true Saturn fan and whenever I decide to give up my present car, it will be replaced with another Saturn for sure!  <br><br>
