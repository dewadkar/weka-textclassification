            As you probably allready know Chevys are very reliable,durable,and comfortable. I have a 1992 Chevy truck that was bought in 1994 with 98,000 miles on it and it currently has 202,000 miles on it. The truck has been very reliable and useful. It has had a few replacement part with include a battery,alternator, carrier barring, and brake service. The truck is an extended cab two wheel drive. Although it is only two wheel drive it can funtion excellent in the snow and mudd of everyday travel.After all the miles put on it the truck averages 22 mpg.There are so many after market truck accessories that anyone could own one and customize it for your conveient everyday use. The only bad thing thats happend is the paint on the hood has started to flake off. maybe ill go for a color change and drive it for six more years<br><br>
