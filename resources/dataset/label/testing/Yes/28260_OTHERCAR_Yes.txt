            What can I say, the Durango stole my heart the moment I laid eyes on it.  My first experience with the Durango was seeing it in the movie Something about Mary, I thought &quot;hey, that's a cute car!&quot;  
I love the intermediate size of the Durango, its not terribly small, yet you don't feel like you are driving a tank either.  
Now I am in no way a car expert, but if you ask me the Durango has very good acceleration.  I mean this puppy has some get up and go to it.
I have found only two faults with the Durango:
1. Gas Mileage
2. Backseat could stand a little more leg room

Overall I love this vehicle, it couldn't get any better (except the two items above).
