            I purchased the HP 620 in February of this year (03).  I knew nothing about digital cameras, but had wanted one anyway, so I did a little bit of research and asked a lot of questions from different stores and users.  

Of course price was my number 1 priority in a good quality digital camera.  After talking to several people and getting advice on camera features I decided to pick the HP 620.  First of all I was told, that I would want a digital camera that offered both optical and digital zoom.  The optical zoom would produce good quality photos up to an 8X10, but if I wanted to produce good quality photos at a larger size, I would want a camera that had a digital zoom feature as well.  This camera has both.  

This camera is very easy to operate, is light weight and offers many features.  This camera also has a video mode for making short video clips.  It is very easy to delete and edit photos that are stored in the camera or on a seperate photo disk, as well as very easy to upload photos onto your computer using the usb cable that came with the camera and the software.  I take the camera nearly every where I go just in case I want to snap a few pictures.  

It offers 3 stars for quality photos; Good being 1 star, Better being 2 stars and best quality being 3 stars.  This mode is also very easy to set.  The higher the quality of photos however, the less storage it provides.  However there is so much storage with this camera it is plenty for me.  I bought this camera at a special sale which offered a free 64mb SD memory card free with camera purchase.  All the features of this camera are very easy to use.

The only problems so far I have found with this camera, is there is still sometimes a red eye problem, also at times when trying to take a picture at the highest digital zoom level, when looking through the viewer, everthing seems out of focus and thus the picture does as well.  I think this may be lack of experience on my part though.  I'm enjoying my camera, but still have not mastered everything about it.  Then of course 1 last draw back is the ever changing batteries.  I'm sure I could take the batteries out of the camera when I'm not using it in order to save some of the life of the batteries.  It will take regular AA alkaline batteries.

There are accessories that can be purchased for this camera
such as a digital camera dock, an AC adapter and a digital camera accessory kit as well as the SD memory card.

It comes with; wrist strap, 4 AA Batteries, USB cable to PC, USB direct print cable, dock insert for the optional digital camera dock, and the CD with hp photo and imaging software with hp shart-to-web software and hp memories disc creator, and a greeting card creator.
