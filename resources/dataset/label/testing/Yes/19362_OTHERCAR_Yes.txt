            My husband and I purchased our 1991 Geo Metro in 1998. We were both driving long distances to work (he 140 miles per day and myself 106) and wanted an inexpensive, reliable car on which we could just put lots of miles. We found this and more in our Metro, which is the most basic model (two-door hatchback, 3-cylinder engine, and manual transmission).

Our car had 69,000 miles on it when we purchased it and now has over 103,000. The only thing (other than general maintenance) that we have had to have done to our Metro was replacing the brake pads, replacing the muffler, and having the hood latch welded. We were expecting to have to replace the clutch, especially considering that my husband was just learning to drive a manual transmission and I did not even know how to yet when we purchased the car, but have not had to replace the clutch yet.

We drove our Metro mostly on interstates for its first year. I'll agree at higher speeds the Metro shakes a little, but one must consider the strain that traveling 70 MPH places on a 3-cylinder engine. Now that our commuting patterns have changed, we now drive it every day in city traffic and it performs like a dream. Since it is a small car, it is also very easy to park in places which larger cars will not fit and is very easy to drive in parking garages. All of these advantages come with the Metro's obvious benefit of excellent gas mileage in this time of high oil prices.

It seems the Metro is often discounted as too small, but people do not realize how roomy it actually is. I am tall and never feel cramped in the car. The seats are even comfortable. The rear seat folds down, enabling one to carry all kinds of cargo. In fact, I unexpectedly had to carry a large box home from work when I drove the Metro and worried that it would not fit in the car. To my surprise, with the seat folded down, the box fit with room left over.

The only disadvantages I would note, as others have noted, are that the buttons to the lights and wipers come off (but can easily be put back on), tires and things like air and oil filters cannot be found at every store since the car is smaller than most (but still can be found at many stores), and our car does not have air bags. We have not yet been in an accident with the Metro and hopefully never will be, so I cannot rate the safety of the car. There is a small amount of body rust on the driver's side, but otherwise, the car still looks very good. It is even still shiny, which is rare considering many cars of the early 1990s were not properly clear-coated.

Although this car may not be right for people wishing to have lots of space, I would definitely recommend it for anyone who needs reliable transportation.
