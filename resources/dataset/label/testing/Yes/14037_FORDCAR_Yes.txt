                 One of a man's best friends is his vehicle. I have four of them, but only one has personality, only one do I actually feel something for: my 1995 cherry-red Ford Ranger XLT. The 3.0 liter V6 engine, although being a bit sluggish in the lower range since day 1, is a workhorse. I admit, since I am deployed quite often, I don't get around to much vehicle maintenance, and my car and trucks have a rough time of it. Yet even through neglect, my Ranger has proven a solid investment again and again, performing in extremes of cold/hot, dusty/icy/muddy weather and terrain like it was born to it. I have never been disappointed.
     At this time I have about 74000 miles on it, and still it does me fine. I will bring it in for a tune up soon, because it deserves some attention...spark plugs, pcv valve, and some other things that should be regularly changed I have never even attended to, and I want it to have the care that professionals can give it-I am definitely not a mechanic.
     I bought this vehicle when I was a pretty low ranking fellow in the USMC, and it appealed not only for the price, but also for the utility, and of course, the way it looked. I have only made one modification, attaching a black plastic toolbox, and it only complements it, making it more &quot;my truck&quot; than ever. It's very easy on my eyes, and I don't think that will ever change, even if the paint starts peeling and the body rotting...it still drives almost like new, even after 5 years, never gives me a problem starting,(even on cold winter mornings), and performs dependably, no matter what the workload or distance. The gas economy is great, especially in these times...
     If you love a tough little worker, a utilitarian machine that won't let you down and is fun to drive, then you should get this and get your money's worth. If you are in the market for a status symbol, go buy an Expedition or a Suburban. This truck is for people who have a job to do.
