            After my VW Jetta achieved 140,000 miles, it was time for a new car, and with family working at Chrysler, the buying price for their products was powerful.  The Cirrus was the choice due to the interior room, and the good road holding characteristics.  The price provided me the size of car I wanted.  The drive train is for me a little underpowered for a V-6, but then again, 75,000 miles into it, I'm still getting around 30mpg for highway, 26 in mixed driving.  The transmission is not very responsive, but with a full mash on the gas, it will do what you need.  The brakes are the worst part of this car.  I finally gave up at 45,000 and had new rotors, pads, rear cylinders and shoes to get the stopping power back.  My mechanic said rear disks instead of drums would cure this, but I'm not spending money to customize this car.  The cup-holder are not very accessable.  I end up using the rear seat holder in the center.  The premium CD player sound system is awesome.  Also, the power seats fit big people, the manual seats don't.  Get the power seat option.  MUCH better.  Over-all, the cost of ownership, the ability to fit 5 people (4 in comfort) with a huge trunk, and ok styling has fit the bill.  I've heard of repair problems for some, but mine has been all but problem free.<br><br>
