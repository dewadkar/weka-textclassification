            I bought it because I got a really good deal and I really like how the S10 Blazer looks.  I purchased it for $4500 while the Kelley Book was $7200 (Fall 2000).  This vehicle was very loyal, always starts, always has power.  It never failed me.  I also have a tendancy to constantly redline any vehicle I drive (I can't help it, it's an addiction!).  
But, sadly, one December night when I was driving home, I took a turn too fast on a slippery road.  I rammed through some poorguys fence.  I was able to drive home no problem and I thought everything was fine.  The only damage I noticed was the front right part of the axle was bent.  However, my insurance company called it &quot;totaled&quot;.  I don't know what i'm going to do know.  I'm thinking of getting a Honda Prelude.  I don't know though, at least I got this rental car for another 5 days.  In short, buy a 92 s10 blazer and you'll be happy with it's 4-wheel drive capabilites.  It's pretty good when it comes to drag racing, but it's no race car (corners aren't tight).  But that's not what it's for.<br><br>
