            Well, you have seen a million of these cars on the road.  Just like the Camry, and the Taurus, it seems like everyone owns an Accord.  And for good reason.  This car handles like a dream, and drives very smooth.  One small problem.  This car is a little noisy.  Also, I think that the car is a little low to the ground.  
We own the mid-priced Accord, not the expensive one with leather and cd-changer.  Our Accord is silver, with a cd-player and air.  Power locks and windows.  No sun-roof or spoiler, or moon-roof.  Simple cloth interior.
Honda makes three basic types of Accord Sedans, the DX, LX, and EX.  The DX is the basic model, then the LX is much nicer, and the EX is the deluxe model.  We own the LX.  My sister owns the LX, and both drive almost exactly the same.  If you can do with out the CD-Changer and the Leather, then stick with the LX.  If you want the basic DX, I would suggest not getting an Accord, and going with the smaller, but still nice, Civic.
We love our Accord.  It has plenty of leg-room in the front, and our 2 year old is safe in the back seat in her car seat and child safety features on the doors and windows.  Great family car.
