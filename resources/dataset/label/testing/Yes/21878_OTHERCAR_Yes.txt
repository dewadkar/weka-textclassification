            Maybe I'm not the ultimate arbiter of this car yet, since I've only had it a week, but so far I love it.  I've wanted one for five years now and finally stepped up to the plate and bought a black Outback Limited.  It's extremely comfortable, the AWD system performs real well in the crummy conditions we have up here in the Northwest half the year (I know this from having rented an Outback two years ago and from testimonials from others here who own one...Subarus are VERY popular in Seattle).  The price was right (Sorry about the person who had such a bad experience with the dealer in California, Auburn Subaru/VW was first class all the way...THANKS BILL)  and although the Limited has features on it that I'll never really use (digital compass for example), what it DOES have is the side air bags in addition to the front air bags that all of them have.  It also has the leather seats which brings me to one of only two complaints I have about the car...the color choices are fairly limited.  The only other complaint is even weaker than the first...the 6-disc CD changer's &quot;Random&quot; function doesn't 'randomly' choose tracks from all 6 CDs, it only 'randomly' chooses tracks from one disc at a time...pretty weak complaints, huh?

One thing I recommend making sure of before you buy is the seating comfort.  I'm 6'1&quot; and well over 200 pounds and I'd have to say that I was unsure if the seat was going to be comfortable on long trips, but I've already taken it across state and I can confirm, for me at least, that they're comfortable...but I advise others to check it out for themselves.

Don't buy the Limited model if you have kids...the leather seats won't like spills from sippy cups and juice boxes...choose the regular Outback instead.<br><br>
