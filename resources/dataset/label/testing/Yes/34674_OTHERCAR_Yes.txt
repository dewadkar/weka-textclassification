            Most of the reviews I have read about this car are a joke and untrue.  Obviously the other reviewers and even some online magazines like Consumers Reports were either jealous or intimidated; but, however they looked at the Firebird one fact remains...they did'nt own one.  I do.

To begin with, I own a Firebird TransAM with the WS6 performance package option (a V8).  After lots of research, I quickly discovered that the Firebird provides the most performance for the buck which is why I purchased one.  To emphasize that statement, you would have to pay $15000 more and step up to the Chevrolet Corvette in order to get a marginal improvement in performance!!  As another example, the WS6 optioned Firebird is the 5th fastest production car in the United States (#4 = Ferrari, #3 = Corvette, #2 = Lotus turbo, #1 = Dodge Viper).  The bottom line is that for less than $31,000, nothing else on the planet can compare to this vehicle.

Do you give up some things for that performance? Yes.  The Firebird interior is Very Comfortable for 2 people.  In order to have a top speed of 162MPH, the forward surface area must be reduced, so the Firebird sits low to the ground.  This creates problems in traffic, when most other vehicles tower over you.  The Back seat area is very small but is infinitely more usable than the extended cab on small pickup trucks.  The Trunk is quite roomy since the rear hatch opens and the back seat can fold down to hold larger items (I went to Sams and purchased a Twin Bed mattress and box spring...it actually fit in the car with the back hatch clamping it down).

Other noteworthy remarks are...

Fuel Mileage!  My car gets about 24-MPG on the highway at 75MPH!  With luggage and 4 passengers, I still get 23-MPG.  In the city, however, that number drops down to about 14-MPG since hard acceleration can really drink some fuel.  Ignore any other remarks about fuel mileage and this car.  Again...when new, the car did badly, but, once the engine broke in (after 1000 miles), the fuel mileage continued to improve dramatically with each tankfull of gas.

Tires...Hurray and ugh.  My car came with the 40 series F1's.  I admit they are some of the best traction tires made on earth period!  However, I now have 14000 miles on my car and the tread is almost gone.  At $320 per tire installed...this is where most of the maintenance costs come from.  One other point is wet traction..I giggle when it rains because these tires are some of the best made for wet traction.  They make you feel safe and secure in the hardest down-pours.

Maintenance.  At 14000 miles, I have had no maintenance other than oil and chassis lube.  The car functions perfectly.

Performance.  The car is fantastic and is one of the safest vehicles produced on the planet.  Safest? Yes!  Pulling almost 1-g of force around corners lets you safely drive around obstacles in everyday roads.  Being able to out-break most other cars gives you an edge in avoiding accidents.  Fast acceleration lets you pass safely on 2-lane roads with ease.  National Insurance Institute then goes on to rate the Firebird as 5 stars (better than most luxury cars).

Bottom line...buy one of these, you will love it!
