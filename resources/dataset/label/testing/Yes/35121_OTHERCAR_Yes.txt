            Hi Folks,
I had wanted to purchase a digital camera for quite some time, I really lucked out when I received the C-211 Zoom as a gift. Like anything else, I went through the trial phase of using it, but it sure didn't take long to master use of the features of this camera. Taking pictures has been fun ! This camera has a nice size display for viewing the subject of the picture, the saved image looks exactly as it did when you clicked the button. I had looked at some of the digital cameras out there, and since I am on a budget, I had been looking into the very modestly priced cameras. I noticed that with some of them, I could get an image to look perfect in the viewer, but when looking at the captured image, I was wondering what happened?!  LOL*  Not very good quality of image. But, with the C-211, it looks very sharp and clear. The size of the camera is BIG, but the trade off is the availability of instant photos. Even the quality of the Polaroid images are good, which says much for the camera. I would highly recommend this camera, for its ease of use, good size viewer screen, instant prints, and editing features for the images right on the camera. I can see how this camera would prove useful for the professional out there who needs good photos for their line of work quickly. Those who would like to save an image in digital form, but would also like to have a print in-hand, Real estate agents, insurance photographers, students, novices like me, as well as experienced users who want to have options when taking pictures should enjoy the features of this camera. Hope this was somewhat helpful to you in your search for information, you can always be assured that my opinion postings will be truthful.
Have a good day everyone,  ~GC~
