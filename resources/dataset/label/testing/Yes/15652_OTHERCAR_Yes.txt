            For starters, let me tell you ...I really like this camera.  Maybe it's the ease of use, or the ability to record on a floppy disk, or its high resolution picture quality.  Who knows, but I can tell you this camera is nice.  
Things that I like about it...
� Easy to use
� Easy to rip pictures from it.
� Speedy disk drive
� Standard SLR camera-like functions.
� Powerful zoom.
� The ability to attach and use standard lens filters.
� Two view finders - 2&quot; LCD screen and eye-piece view finder.
� Rechargable battery
� Flash

Things I don't like about it...
� Costly - $1000.00- yikes
� The fact that the recorded image is a video still and not a true picture...but thats the case with many digitals.
� bulky
� battery runs down quickly - especially with flash.
� useless movie recording feature.
� limited storage options.

Overall, I like the camera.  It takes marvelous pictures and is easy to use.  I recommend getting one if you have the money.<br><br>
