            I purchased my Integra GS in the fall of 1998 as a sporty daily driver. What i got was one the most fun to drive vehicles i have ever been in. 
My integra is equipped with the non-VTEC engine, but it never once lacked enough power to get going. The five speed manual is very slick, and is the best shifting manual i have ever had the pleasure of rowing through the gears. And oh that sound! Try revving one of these bad boys out to the redline, and you will instantly be in love. Even my father, a die-hard Detroit guy (he drives a 1970 GTO) cracked a grin ear to ear while testing my new ride out.
The seats are made by Recaro, which gives an indication of how they border on perfection. 
I was under the impression that 5'10&quot; was the tallest someone could be to comfortable drive this car, but a friend of mine who is 6'3&quot; said it was very comfortable behind the wheel. 
Fuel economy is excellent as long as you have the will power to keep the revs under 3500. I rarely do.
Handling is as good as you are likely to find anywhere. That is no exageration. I have personally driven this car over 200km/h (I can email you the ticket to prove it) and can report the car never feels out of control, unless you do something truly stupid.
As a daily driver, the Integra is a homerun. As soon as i get my points back on  my liscence, it will serve as mine again.
If you drive it, and your human, you will want it.
By the way, in Canada, snow tires help a lot!<br><br>
