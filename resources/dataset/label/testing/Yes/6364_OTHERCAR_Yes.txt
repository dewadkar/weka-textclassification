            My friend recently bought the 2000 Montle Carlo SS, and I wish it was mine!  This is car is pure power and it is so nice! The ride is nice and smooth and feels like your driving a nascar when you hit over 90.  Here are some features about the car...The 2000 Monte Carlo is a 2-door, 5-passenger midsize coupe available in two trims, the LS and SS, my friend has the SS. Base prices are around $19,290 and $21,735 for the LS and SS, he paid like $22,550. Monte Carlo's closest competitors include the Dodge Avenger, Chrysler Sebring Coupe, Honda Accord Coupe and Mercury Cougar. According to Chevrolet, &quot;Monte Carlo is a very distinctive, personal driving machine that surrounds you with performance in a premium environment.&quot; The LS is equipped with a standard 3.4-liter, V6, 180-horsepower engine that consumes 20-mpg in the city and 32-mpg on the highway. The SS is equipped with a standard 3.8-liter, V6, 200-horsepower engine that consumes 20-mpg in the city and 29-mpg on the highway. A 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive is standard on both trims. Design highlights include a 4-point driver interface system, newly designed seats and NASCAR-inspired instrument panel and gauges. Standard features not shared by one or more of the Monte Carlo's competitors include 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, cargo area power outlet, 100,000-mile extended service interval, radio data system, automatic on/off headlights, daytime running lights, front armrest storage and a rear split-bench seat with theater style seating.  The Monte Carlo was completely redesigned for 2000. Exterior changes include new headlights, taillights, distinctive C-pillars and rear decklid spoiler (standard on the SS). <br><br>
