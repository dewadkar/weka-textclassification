            We bought our 2000 Mazda Protege ES in February.  My husband brought it home as a surprise for me.  I had just had surgery on Thursday, abdominal surgery, and getting in and out of cars was difficult to say the least.  I just had to get into this new car of mine, and really had no trouble, other than minor discomfort from the stitches (happened when I sat down, no matter where I sat).  So the drivers seat is roomy.  And comfortable.  I have chronic back pain, and in other cars have had back pain while driving, and I've yet to experience that with this vehicle.  The child-safety locks are great, as is the ability to lock all windows but the drivers window.  The trunk is quite roomy, which was an unexpected treasure.  I have the optional cassette player, which is lacking in a few features, however, most people don't use cassette's anymore.  The sound system is quite good for the money, not top of the line of course, but good.  

Things I dislike about the vehicle:  I am a larger person, and the middle console is quite difficult to get to.  I rarely use it, and forget I can even put things in it.  The weather stripping around the door is also coming loose, after only a few months.  However a quick glue job and it is as good as new.

Things I like about the vehicle:  It's great to drive, handles terrific, and in the few instances where quick stopping was needed, it was great.  With the gas prices as they are now, I am pleased with the gas mileage.  Everything is spaced in good positions, such as the air conditioning vents, the cd/radio system, cruise control.  The odometer has 2 resetable stations on it, which makes it easier to gauge distance per gas tank, as well as individual drives, without losing information.  

Overall, it's a great car for someone with kids, or just a single person, or couple.  It's priced right, almost anyone can afford it.  It's roomy enough inside for even the largest person, but compact enough for the small parking spaces that seem to be everywhere.  I do highly recommend this car.<br><br>
