            Land Rover have again won over many hearts with the release of an upgraded 2001 model Land Rover Discovery. With an entirely different V8 engine to the existing 2000 model Series II and numerous interior and exterior changes, the 2001 model is the refined discovery many have been eagerly awaiting.

Since the incarnation of the Discovery shape as we know it the the early 1900's, this model has gone on to become one of the more popular vehicles powering along on our roads. A supreme performer by any measure, the Discovery features a powerful V8 engine with HDC - Hill Decent Control, ABS - Anti-Lock Braking System, ETC - Electronic Traction control, and ACE - Active Cornering enhancement to mention just a few of many many comprehensive features. As you may well have identified I have an affinity with the Series II Discovery but have critically analysed the vehicle from the tire alignment to the composite used in the construction of the body and the glass used in the recessed window paynes in the third row seating and luggage area. 

The Discovery I own is an Australian model 2001 ES V8 Discovery, fitted with a tow-bar and additional extras. A comfortable cruiser for the family, the car has impressive traction comparable to vehicles I have driven including a Jaguar XJ6, BMW Series II 7 Series, Mercedes S500 and Bentley Azure. The Land Rover Discovery is a well priced vehicle above all the features so many outstanding and prooven features that some would consider high tech for even a Mercedes S-Class or the new BMW 7-Series sedan. Maybe even as intricate as some of the components found in Honda's electric car displayed throughout the world.

Although a relatively new car, reliability has been impressive and I had previously owned a 91 model Discovery that never once had I had to spend a dollar on apart from servicing and fuel requirements along with the weekly wash and polish inside and out. The Discovery has great ground clearence that like many buses lowers down at stop to allow passengers to board easily. It lowers dramatically at the rear to allow 3rd row passengers to disembark, but the car can quickly lift back up at the press of a button. Wood-grain finishings and an entire leather fit-out mark the prestige of this vehicle, that can quickly be transformed into a hard-core off-roader. However its practical enough to not even have to change anything as all of the electronic components sense new terrain and adjust the vehicle accordingly. It is no wander why they call this the most advance four-wheel-drive, and you only have to own one to appreciate the features. A 12 speaker Harmon Kardon surround sound stereo unit with large rear sub-woffer and impressive storage space top-off this elegant mobile.

Our car itself, has achieved only 50,000 KM, following two services and sings like a bird on the highway and the desert sands of the Northern Territory or rugged terrain of inner-Queensland and Westen Australia. Towing power is the best you'll find until you buy a light-truck with V12 power or above because the BMW V8 or BMW Turbo-Diesel powers like a three-hundred horsepower V8 on a 3.0 metre aluminium bass boat. Clearly the Rover owned company has succeeding in formulating in impressive design for decades still to come.
