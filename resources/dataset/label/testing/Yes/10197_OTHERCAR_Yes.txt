            The Lexus RX300 is a great SUV. The handling is great, the ride is smooth, and most controls are logical. The controls for the stereo are a little strange but I got used to it. The gas mileage is great too - about 20 mpg overall. It's hard to enjoy any othe SUV afterwards.

Some people think that the Lexus is not a true SUV - you wouldn't want to take it off road. That's true, but I think only a complete idiot would take *any* $35000 vehicle off road. If you want to go off road, get a used Jeep and beat it to death. No one I know has bought a new *real* SUV, like an Mercedes ML320 or a *new* Toyota 4Runner so they can beat it to death. There is nothing worse for any vehicle then to be taken off road. If you want to wear out all the parts as fast as possible, then take it off road.

Most people buy an SUV for going skiing, hauling stuff, and because they enjoy the high seating position. In all these qualities, the Lexus is tops. Nothing is better and I've driven all other SUVs.
