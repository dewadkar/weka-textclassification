            Keep in mind that I've only had this car for about three months at this point. I'll write more after I've had it for longer. It is a used 1998 Forester which I bought in Feb 03. It had about 52k at time of purchase. Mine is a manual 5-speed.

So far I've had no problems with the car. It runs great.

Pros:

--Reliability: Subarus are supposed to be very reliable. I see lots of slightly older Subarus around town, so they must last a while.

--Size: I like the size of this car (I wouldn't have bought it otherwise). It is definitely a step up from my Nissan Sentra (a car I love, but is getting to be too small for us). The front seats are nice and roomy. My husband is a little over 6' and is quite comfortable in this car. The back seats seem fairly roomy--maybe a little cramped for adults on long trips, but certainly enough room for kids. Again, much more room than my Sentra. The back is a good size for most uses. You can easily fit a week's worth of groceries back there. My dog (70 lb. lab) rode pretty comfortably in the back with a cooler and a couple other boxes when we went camping. (Note: camping pretty much maxed out the car. The backseat was stuffed and we had stuff strapped to the top. A car-top carrier might be nice for our next trip.) Despite having a roomy interior, the car is surprisingly small and agile. It fits into any parking space easily, unlike trying to park a big SUV or minivan.

--Height: This car is the perfect height for me. It doesn't sit way low like most cars. (I considered the Subaru Outback, but didn't like sitting so low to the ground.) It's also not too high. It's not top-heavy at all. It's really easy to get into, so it would probably be good for an older person. Getting in and out of my Sentra was like climbing in and out of a black hole. The car's height makes for good visibility.

--AWD: All wheel drive is great for rainy weather and gravel. The car has a lot of stability on turns--seems like more than my Sentra even though it's taller.

--Features: Adjustable lumbar support in drivers' seat; adjustable seatbelt height in both front seats (great for those of us who are used to having the diagonal belt across our necks!); front airbags; little compartments everywhere; cup holders (1 in dash, 1 in center compartment, 2 in back); decent sound system compared to our last car (multiple speakers, casette & CD); rubber mat for trunk protects carpeting; full-sized spare tire; power door locks and windows, etc.

Cons:
There really isn't any major problem with this car. Here are some little things.

--Window frames: (or lack thereof) The windows have no metal frame, making them quite vulnerable. Apparently Subarus have been like this for years. I don't know if newer models still have this.

--Cup holder locations: I suppose there's no way to design cup holders that everyone will love. They're in a better location than the cup holders in my Sentra, so I'm pretty happy, but they could be in a better place. In particular, the one in the dash covers up some of the controls when in use. The one in my Sentra covered up even more controls and didn't accomodate such a large cup, so I'm pretty happy with these cup holders.

--Mirrors: This is the stupidest thing. The side mirrors aren't power-operated (that's OK), but they aren't even manually operated from inside the car! You have to roll the window down and reach out! This is especially irritating in cold/rainy weather, i.e. all the time here in Oregon.

--Price: These used Foresters seem kind of hard to find (at least in my area) and they're pretty popular, so they can be a little spendy. I got mine at a dealership for about 12,500.
