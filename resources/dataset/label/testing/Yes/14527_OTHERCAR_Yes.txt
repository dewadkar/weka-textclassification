            I purchased the Touring Coupe model from the 1993 ElDorado line in August 2000 with under 56,000 miles on it.  This was the first ElDorado to feature the Northstar engine.  At 295 hp, it certainly gives me the power I need to move in an out of traffic and to get that extra &quot;zip&quot; when I need it.  Though I'm 20, I'm not using this vehicle to give off a &quot;boy racer&quot; image.  The comfortable, quiet, ride, and the feeling of safety truly define this car--though the engine power is welcome when needed.  There is plenty of room for 4 passengers in this car, even the clients and business associates I plan to go for rides with from time to time.

Trunk has ample room for 4 sets of golf clubs, or other large objects.  

The car doesnt handle poorly for a large front wheel drive coupe.  It can can handle winding turns at high speeds without getting out of control, but dont get me wrong this isnt a Corvette or a Lexus SC400.  Those cars are luxury roasters. This is a luxury coupe.

A little tough to turn and park.  Must start to maneuver vehicle before you think you actually have to start turning the wheel.  Heavy car, heavy breaking.  However these issues dont outweigh the negatives.<br><br>
