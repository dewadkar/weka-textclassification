            When deciding between the Passport and CRV, consider that the CRV, feels like it has more room,  and has a much smoother ride.  The hidden picnic table is a plus, and comes in handy for family outings.  I have owned 3 other Honda and always felt safe, but the CRV, is truly the best SUV for the money, and I looked at them all!  If I could change one thing, it would be for the CD player be included, instead of a cassette.

The crash tests on the CRV have all been good, and the reliable Honda reputation continues.<br><br>
