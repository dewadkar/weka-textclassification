            This is an update of a previous opinion that I wrote about my 2000 Subaru OBS. It's been almost a year later, and here is what I feel has stayed the same and changed about my opionion of the car.

<i>Here is what I love about the car:</i>

<b>AWD:</b> When I first purchased the car, It was spring and I could only try out the car on dirt/back or main roads. Now that winter is finally here I had a chance to try it in the snow. All I have to say is THANK YOU SUBARU! This car laughs in the face of snow. I've had no problem getting through a few inches of snow. The biggest test is my driveway...long and steep, my old front wheel drive Ford had the hardest time in the winter. I was able to get up the driveway in almost 2" of snow EFFORTLESSLY with the OBS without missing a beat. I even stopped on the hill and then continued up and I didn't get stuck. 

<b>CD/CASSETTE/RADIO:</b> Actually really nice. Not enough to impress an audiophile, but for the average listener, better than what you'd expect.

<b>HANDLING:</b> Great. It feels really tight and turns and corners really well. 

<b>CARGO ROOM:</b> Excellent, even if you don't fold down the back seats, there is still plenty of enough room for groceries, winter supplies or whatever else you have to haul. If you DO put the back seats down, don't worry, you can fit anything in this car. 

<b>RIDE/NOISE:</b> VERY quiet ride, road noise is very minimal.

Finally, I ESPECIALLY  love the looks of the car. Everyone comments on it. I got the silver/titanium pearl color. Even when its dirty, it still doesn't look that bad :)

<i>Now, what I dislike about the car:</i>

<b>DENT RESISTANCE:</b> I only had the car 2 days, and I already discovered a minor dent in the rear driver side door. I've pulled it out as best I could with a plunger/suction device but its positioned right where the door curves so I can't get any better suction. Oh well :) I guess its officially mine now :) 

<b>CUP HOLDERS:</b> Though pretty much big enough, the one in the dash blocks the climate controls. You can still get at them, its just a little tough :) 

<b>SEATS:</b> Not too bad. The side support is somewhat uncomfortable if you have to lean on them due to the metal bar in the seat.

<b>WINDSHIELD WIPERS:</b> No variable intermittent windshield wiper. 

<b>REAR SEAT ROOM:</b> With the front seats all the way back there is almost no rear seat room to speak of. With the front seats pulled up a bit there is some, but lets hope you don't have to give charles barkley a lift somewhere. The front seats are a different story, there's probably more than you need :) 

<b>WINDOW SWITCHES:</b> They don't light up! Well, the driver's switch does but everyone else's switch doesn't. Oh well. 

<b>INNER DOOR HANDLE DURABLITY:</b> The foam or rubber or whatever it is that makes up the armrests is horrible. I have many "pits" or "dings" in the driver side door handle from god knows what. There are quite a few in the rear driver side handle but thats from me being careless. I also discoved a few "notches" on the inner door panel up by the bottom of the window. 

Overall, this is a GREAT car. All the standard features, plus AWD for under $20,000. There are a few nitpicky things, but thats all they are, nitpicky. Nothing major. If you're single/married w/ no kids/married w/ small kids and you want a safe, reliable, sporty car, this is definately it.
