            I bought my 88 Jeep Cherokee used about three years ago.  I purchased it from an ad that I called on in the local newspaper.  When I bought my Jeep it had 99,000 miles on it and the specs of it included four wheel drive, 4.0 engine, laredo package, off-road package, four doors and all power.  It was in good shape.  I was able to steal it at a meager $3000.

Ever since I have owned it I have had one problem right after another.  I have been through 90% of the whole vehicle.  Here is the list of some of the fixes or repairs that I have done.  The following were a pain in my a$$: alternatorX3, timing chain, panhard bar, coolant reservoir, both motor mounts, engine fan, rear end went bad, cruise stopped, rear deck leaked, new bearings, harmonic balancer fell apart, leak in front of passenger seat, etc.  I left out that every damn seal or gasket has leaked or is leaking right now. I have only put  32,000 miles on it since I bought it.

Don't get me wrong though, I love my Jeep.  I don't know, maybe it is just at that mileage point where most cars have everything start to go in them.  My feelings are this,  if you are a decent mechanic and you like to work on cars, the Jeep Cherokee is an excellent vehicle for you.  I have my Jeep in excellent working order right now and I will not sell it for a long time.
