            Okay Ford has made it quite clear who has won the &quot;bigger is better&quot; war.
this has gone just a bit too far.this is like saying &quot;come drive our 4-wheel drive bus!&quot;it handles like a tank and looks about the same,but I'm not here to beat up on the EXCURSION or any car for that matter except the toyota's of the world.
     The EXCURSION boasts huge horse power and a cool new V-10 but beware it is a gas hog!The EXCURSION can tow any thing behind it's huge wheel base whithout a whimper.and that huge wheel base is something that can hurt too. Try to parralell park this beast! Here is something they don't tell you at the dealership...One good gust of wind and the EXCURSION changes lanes without warning or controll!! I don't want my kids in that!!
So if you dont mind some of the drawbacks this machine IS the ultimate &quot;Mine's bigger than your's&quot; machine! <br><br>
