            We bought our Dodge Neon Sport off the dealer's lot in January 1995.  Our Toyota Corolla had recently died, and it was time for a new, small car.  Even though this was the first model year for the Neon, we decided to take a chance on it versus the Geo (Chevy) Prizm (Toyota Corolla).  What a good choice!  

This is truly the little car that could.  Ours is a manual transmission, and has needed very little in the way of service other than routine oil changes, brake pads, tire rotations, etc.  It may not be the most fashionable car, but it has been an excellent value for our $13K.  

Features:  Our car is pretty much fully-loaded, and we've been very happy with it.  The split back seat is great for hauling things.  The vanity mirrors on the visors light up, an appreciated bonus.  And there are good passenger-compartment lights for nighttime driving.  Our other car, a Ford Focus, has very inadequate lighting in this regard, and the visor mirrors do not light up--it was not even an option.  We did not think to even check or consider this (perhaps because the Neon is so great in this regard!) until after we'd bought the Focus.  The air conditioning, heat, and defrost are MUCH better in this car than in our Ford--there simply is no comparison.  The ride is quiet, the seats are comfy, and the gas mileage is great.  In regard to room, it is a small car, but if you need basic transportation, this is one to consider.  

Reliability:The one-year old Ford is in the shop about once every six weeks; the Neon has been in exactly once for a repair in nearly six years.
And, the Dodge dealers have been much easier to deal with than the local Ford dealership (perhaps because we see them so rarely!)

Drawbacks:  If you are short, it can be a bit difficult to see around the highback styling and over the hood of the Neon.  But, like so many other things, you do get used to it.  It would be nice if the backseat locked, to provide better security in the trunk.  

Overall, a very good buy!
