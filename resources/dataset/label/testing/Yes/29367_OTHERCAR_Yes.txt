            We have had our CRV for a little over a year and there are good sides and bad. Overall we really enjoy driving it, but it does have a number of drawbacks.  On the positive side, the car handles really well, in ice, water, and snow.  The drivers seat is very comftorable and since the CRV is higher up than a regular car, you have a great vantage point to see traffic clearly.  The hatchback is great, and holds all your groceries or strollers, and anything else you might need.  I like that you can open only the glass part if you need.  On the negative side, the CRV has only a V4 engine and really needs a little more pickup if you are travelling on the highway or up an incline.  Also, the back seat feels very  cramped(especially when you have a carseat in one of the seats)  ANother negative point is the leg room in back, there really is very little and 5 people cannot fit easily in this car.  Overall we really like our CRV and have enjoyed driving it.<br><br>
