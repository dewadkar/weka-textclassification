            I have no business in a vehicle this nice.  I even taunt myself in my epinions profile.  I can't remember exactly what I said, but it references me and my beat up blue Honda.  That's been my measuring stick for six years, and I finally brought myself into the next echelon of auto owners, from compact economy car to Sport Utility Vehicle.  In one broad stroke of ink on checkbook, my driving life changed, and the rest of my life with it.
Hondas don't afford their owner much spontanaeity, outside of the spur of the moment 7-11 run.  Now I can grab a sleeping bag and a cooler, my skis and my girl, and head to the mountains for a long weekend, or to Big Sur for a camping adventure.  I can even drive over that center divider between lanes, hit speed bumps without leaving parts behind and roll my windows all the way up.
I might seem easy to please, but when you take a step up like I just took, the simple things make the most difference.  That's the beauty of my Blazer - everything works, and works well.  I don't know all the specs.  I know it's a V6, 4wheel drive, CD player, big wheels, underbody package, wide stance - and that's all I need to know.  Point me to the gas tank and I'm rolling.  
And the roll is the best part - it's smooth, effortless, and it feels like there's nothing that could ever go wrong.  The car is safe.  If, god forbid, I hit something - I'll go right through it.  And right into my airbag.  Although the chances of hitting things go down when you're this high above everything else on the road....
Being this high can scare a lot of people (insert pun here), but I love it.  I can see ahead of the traffic, over it actually, and I can still fit into most parking spaces.  Although now that I own a new car, I have to become a &quot;new car guy,&quot; watching out for my doors, bumpers, etc.  Obnoxious but necessary.  Small price to pay, I think.
I haven't taken him off-roading yet, but I can't wait.  From what I hear, it's worth whatever wait I end up with though.  Chevy's don't get that cool song in their ads for no reason.  They're tough...
So if you want an SUV, they're affordable, they're fun, they look good and the sound is impressive, to say the least.  I almost enjoy driving alone more than with a navigator for the first time in my life.  If you're in the market for an SUV, look no further - Blazer's it.
