            Ok, here's the deal with this car.  The price, fully loaded: tax, title, license, out the door, was just under $30K.  I put $5K down, sold my old 1997 Jeep Wrangler on my own, and my payment on the $25K is $398.22 per month, to buy, not to lease.
<p>
I've most recently owned a Passat and a Jeep Wrangler and would have no problems - financially - buying a $75K car if I wanted to.  Compared to my Passat and Jeep, this is seriously the best car ever.  
<p>
I'm averaging 52mpg, and go 400 miles on a tank before filling up for just over $10.  I think I could go much farther on the 11.9 gallon tank, but for some reason it starts to blink and tell me to get gas, then only takes about 7.5 or 8 gallons strange.
<p>
As someone who can deduct mileage, you'll come out far ahead with this car.  You can also get a $2K deduction from the feds and in Arizona you get a $2K deduction per year as well - this really helps!!!  Soon, you'll hopefully be able to drive in the HOV lanes as a single driver, when that happens your time savings will be very valuable indeed, and you'll now be faster than a Ferrari at rush hour!
<p>
My insurance went DOWN $800 per year compared to my Jeep Wrangler - woo hoo!
<p>The nav system works great but could use improvement.  It really needs better voice recognition, I'll say something and it'll misinterpret it all the time. 
<p>The climate control system is awesome.
<p>The bluetooth functionality is cool, but check your phone first - my Sony Ericsson P800 (and the P900) doesn't work with the car - and the phone is nearly $1000 - use the Sony Ericsson T600, T610, etc series.
<p>Quiet... soooo quiet.
<p>Roomy - this has more interior room than the VW Passat and more interior room than the Lexus ES300
<p>Leather - not offered, and it should be!
<p>MP3 - why not have a built in mp3 player or at least let the cd changer play mp3s - this really sucks and Toyota should improve this ASAP.  The only way for my mp3 player to connect (I won't use those FM based trashy things) is through a cassette adapter.
<p>Storage - this has the ultimate storage for any car - 6 cup/bottle holders, two glove boxes, a HUGE center console with extra power outlets, a slide out drawer under the console, etc., etc.  Love it!
<p>Tint the windows ASAP.
<p>Power - this thing is really zippy - I can be at 90mph by the time I enter a freeway.  0 to 30 is decent enough, but 30 to 70 it really picks up!
