            My,19yr.old son bought this 92 plymouth sundance,used with about 68,000
miles. It had good power and got about 22 miles to the gallon. It was
his college ride and he drives about 60 miles a day besides,dating and
working. He wanted something newer and more expensive but the car grew
on him and became a trusted companion. He came in our drive way,when
I had my suv locked in. It went really well in 6ins. of snow. It was an affordable ride.
   On his way to work last week,he was involved in a 3 car accident.While no one was injured,the cars all received a fair amount of damage. I
Have never thought much of airbags but this time it may have saved him from serious harm. He has the car in are garage and has began to
dismantle the bent parts and has discovered that the car was well put
together. There is enough of these cars around that he has already
discovered, a salvage car in the same color. This will help keep
repair cost down. When you live in an area of highest unemployment in the nation,you have to learn to make do. This car was worth his money and
looks like will continue to give good service.<br><br>
