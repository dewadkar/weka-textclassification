            The new L series Saturn is more than people realize.  The l300 series is only a rename of saying LS2.  Same for the rest.  Ls1 is the L100 and LS2 is the L200.  I am focusing on the L300 I saw at the 2001 auto show last night.  I have driven the LS2 (same vehicle different name as I just stated) before but it was not as nice as what I saw.  I talked to the salesman on the floor and he unlocked the car on the pedistal and let us in it.  
   
   It was so plush you would not even associate it to be a Saturn.  It was more like a buick style interior.  The dash had your important gages, a computer to tell you when you need to change the oil...  Dual heated and powered leather seats that were so comfortable that I did not want to get out of them.  The back seat was so plush with more leg and head room than I could believe.  I never actually felt the car out like this but 

   After getting in and looking at all the features from the traction control/4 disc antilock brakes/pwr moonroof/ cruise/amfm stereo cd and cassette player/dual zone digital climate controls, power win/locks/mirrors/keyless entry, dual lighted visors, onstar computer system w/security sys./dual front and side airbags/very large glovebox and trunk.  EVERYTHING under the sun for only 23,500 give or take.  Well worth the value.  The engine is a 182 horsepower v6 with excellent gas milage.  Same motor used in the SAAB S3.  Very peppy with plenty of torque.  I do not recall the numbers off hand...  How could you go wrong?
When I drove the LS2 (L300) it handled so crisp and took the corners with perfection and I could go on for hours.  Made my SL2 look stupid.  The outside looks smaller than the inside.  When you get inside it is if the car doubled in size!  Definite room for 5 adults!
