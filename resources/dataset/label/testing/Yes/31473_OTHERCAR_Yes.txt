            We've owned a 1990 Audi 200 sedan (bought used) since 1993 and now have more than 170,000 miles on it. Audis are superb drivers' cars and are a great experience to drive. They're solid, dependable and fast on the highway, but they demand more maintenance and more mechanical knowledge or a deeper checkbook than most cars. They are a mixed bag and if you're not capable of doing any mechanical work they're probably not the car for you.

Background: the 1990 200 is part of the Audi 5000-100-200 series built from 1984 through 1991, all of which are referred to as the type 44 chassis. Generally speaking the type 44 chassis cars improved after the first couple of years, as systems became more dependable. Regardless, there are passionate advocates for every year of production and many of them are still on the road after running more than 200K miles.  After the model numbering change from 5000 to 100/200, the 100 and 200 are the same car; the differences in the 200 are that it's turbocharged, has 4-wheel disc brakes (rather than rear drums) and slightly firmer suspension, it came stock with a 60-series tire rather than a 70-series tire, and has full-width taillights which are easy to pick out in traffic.

Further note: there are TWO versions of the 1990 and 1991 200. One of them is a 10-valve model, the other is a 20-valve. Since this is a 5-cylinder car, this means the models have 2 or 4 valves per cylinder respectively.  The 20-valve car is a high performance model, it's more technical to work on, and the parts are harder to find and more expensive. On the other hand, it goes like "a bat" and is a joy to drive if you love performance sedans. This review is about the more common 10-valve, which you are most likely to find. Be aware that if you find a 20-valve, it's a fast car with expensive parts. For an enthusiast a 20-valve model can be a real find, but it will demand more $$ to maintain.

Here are the pluses:
- These cars are superbly engineered and built like tanks. They will protect the passengers incredibly well through terrible crashes. They've scored some of the highest crash scores ever recorded by NHTSA, and you can feel safe with your family in one.
- The 200 has plenty of room, and the interior is solid and rattle-free even with 170K miles on the car. There are more rattles in my 1999 Blazer than in this 13-year-old Audi!
- The 200 is a driver's car. It's responsive, you can feel the road, and it's stable in town at 20 MPH or on a deserted Texas road at 100 MPH. If you like the feel of a serious road car, the 200 can be your dream car. Seriously, this is one of the most satisfying cars to drive I've ever experienced, and that counts for a lot if you're a "car guy".
- The 1990 model comes with anti-lock brakes (ABS) and a driver's side air bag.
- The seats are firm and incredibly comfortable. The front seats are multi-control power seats in which anyone can get comfortable. The front and rear seats all have seat heaters (which may or may not still be working, but which can usually be fixed by working on the switches or the elements in the seats) and which are great for cold winter mornings.
- The interiors hold up well whether they're leather or velour, and will keep you comfortable on long trips.
- The handling is superb for a big sedan, and the turning radius is incredibly tight. I swear the 200 will turn in a smaller circle than my 280ZX sports car.
- The 5-cylinder engine is one of the most durable ever built. Ours runs like a watch at 170K miles and there are many reports of these engines going 200,000 and 300,000 miles without rebuilds.
- The 200 came in front wheel drive (FWD) or Quattro all-wheel drive. The FWD model will get you through most weather problems, and the Quattro model will take you anywhere an SUV will go. 
- The turbo in the 200 model has one of the best designs on the market, being both oil and water-cooled. As a result, they can last practically forever. There is an after-run pump which keeps circulating water through the turbo to cool it after the engine is turned off. 
- You can tell if the turbo is working by test driving it and setting the dash computer to show boost.  If it shows over 1.0 bar on acceleration, the turbo works. If not, figure at least $600 for a turbo rebuild plus two days' work to pull the bad one and replace it with the rebuilt. or maybe you just want a 100 model!
- Resale prices are low on these cars and you can buy a LOT of vehicle for the money.
- Used parts are available from many auto recyclers (wrecking yards) and other sources to help you keep the car in top shape at affordable prices.
- Overall, the Audi is so durable that if you maintain it yourself you will find that it's economical and a good investment in transportation. Most of the work you do will be on minor systems, and the big stuff generally runs almost forever.

For a safe, luxurious transportation at a low price, the Audi 200 is hard to beat PROVIDED that you're willing to do some of your own mechanical work.  The equation shifts if you're not mechanical, because these cars are designed by Germans to require regular maintenance.  You won't want to pay a shop to do everything to it, nor do you EVER want to buy parts from an Audi dealer. It's simply too expensive.

Here are the downsides:

- Small electrical parts fail due to design quirks and (at this point) age. Things like door and window switches, dash lights, cruise controls, hi/low beam switches are all failure points. These parts can be found used. They're not hard to replace; in fact, switches can be disassembled, cleaned and refurbished on your kitchen table. If you don't want to mess with these things, don't buy an old Audi.
- Known weak points in the type 44 chassis (all years) are power steering racks and automatic transmissions. If the steering rack shows leakage, figure $1000 for a mechanic to replace it or if you do it, a long weekend plus $500 or more in parts. It is not a fun job. If the auto tranny leaks into the front transaxle, it can ruin the transaxle as well, and you will have to hunt for an entire used transaxle. It's a good idea to check the auto tranny fluid and make sure there's no gear oil in it; if there is, avoid the car. One way around this is to buy a manual transmission; they're extremely durable and more fun to drive anyway. I believe the 200 was only available with an automatic transmission in 1990, but manual transmissions are available in other years and there is really no difference in the cars, as they are the same vehicle with minor variations in trim.
- The stock US headlights in 89, 90 and 91 are inadequate at highway speeds. Because of lousy lens design, they don't light the road far enough ahead. If you do mostly city driving, this is no problem for you. Many Audis of this vintage have had the US headlights replaced with European headlights, which are much better and in fact superior to all US headlights of that era.  If you buy one and do much driving on back roads at night, plan on spending about $500 on European headlights and side lights.
- Take a look at the headliner; in hot parts of the US, they've been known to delaminate and fall down. After 8 years in Texas, this happened to us, but I secured mine with short (1/4") screws and simply didn't worry about it any more!
- Parts are prohibitively expensive through dealers. You will need to develop your own cadre of parts vendors other than the dealer, meaning you'll have to order ahead or wait for parts. However, there are many good vendors available for Audi parts.

Here's why we own this car:

My wife loves driving this car, it has never stranded us in 170K miles, and it drives like a dream. I've put in a lot of hours wrenching on it, but even with TWO automatic transmissions rebuilds (first one was poorly done) over the 10 years we've owned the car, I estimate our average annual cost of repairs at less than $600. That's $50 a month in maintenance to drive a big, safe luxury car. And by the way - it still averages 22-24 MPG on the highway at 75 MPH.

When you buy this car, you buy a prime example of German thinking. For example, there are no cupholders. Why? Because the Germans believe that when you drive, both hands belong on the wheel and you should not be drinking or eating. This car is designed with simple, clean lines which are timeless. Most people won't know that the car is 13 years old because the styling changes from year to year were subtle, and because the paint jobs are extremely good and very durable. Our 1990 Audi has better paint than most three-year-old US-made cars. 

Advice: If you buy an older Audi, you should join the Quattro internet mailing list found at www.audifans.com.  It's a busy and verbose list, but the people on that list know how to repair ANYthing on an Audi and you can save thousands of dollars in parts and labor by taking advantage of the website and their expertise.
