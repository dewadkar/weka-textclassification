            I bought a Saturn in 1994 for my daughter and to this day it is still running like new.  The only time this car was ever in the shop was for scheduled maintenance.
 
As of now I own a 1996 SC2 and it has been just as dependable.

Safety is very important to me when purchasing a car and both have great safety records.  Being single and female, I have always been concerned about breaking down in an undesirable place.  Not a problem with a Saturn they have your best interest in mind.  They have road service and it works.

Their friendly service when using their facilities is unsurpassed.  I have never felt so welcome and appreciated.  Especially at the shop in Newport News, Va.  The receptionist at the front desk would address me by name even before I told her who I was.  That is a great feeling especially when you are away from home.  You are always made to feel a part of their family.  Although this was the only service that made me feel like that it was a memorable experience and one that all shops should follow.  I will probably always own a Saturn, I only wish they would make a Sport Utility Vehicle.<br><br>
