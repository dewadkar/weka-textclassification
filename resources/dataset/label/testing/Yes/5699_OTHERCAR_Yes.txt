            If you want a car that has a dependable engine and transmission only, the 98 Altima makes a fine choice.  But Nissan obviously put all their money into these items at the expense of many of the internal components.  Examples?  Well so far my drivers side window rolls up extremely slowly, the fins that direct the heat-a/c airflow have melted, the cd player broke and a radio preset button fell off, the light that shows which gear the car is in went out, there is an annoying rattle in both the windshield and the glove box, and a hubcap fell off.  Driving the car is fine, I find the seats comfortable and the tranny shifts fairly well - perhaps not as smooth as I would like but not bad.  For a 4 cylinder car, it has pretty good power (150 mph) although the engine still races sometimes if I try to jump into traffic and quickly accelerate.  I have driven this car over high mountain passes in the Rockies and it holds its own at about 50 mph even through the highest parts.  The factory tires suck - go ahead and replace them ASAP if you do a lot of wet weather or winter driving (replace at least the front two).  This car gets pretty good mileage; I do a lot of stop-and-go driving so I can't tell for sure but I'd guess it's about 25 mpg.  The problem, however, is that this car only has an 11 gallon fuel tank and I find myself refueling a little bit more often than I'd like to.
