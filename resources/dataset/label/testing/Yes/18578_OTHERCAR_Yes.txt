            <b>My second SUV</b>
I started out driving an S-10 1986 Blazer and loved it to death. We had to get rid of it because it had almost 200,000 miles on it and we were in the process of buying a 1998 Suburban. I now drive a 1994 Jimmy and I love it more than I did the Blazer. It is a much more comfortable ride than what the Blazer was, and it had a lot more options.

<b>My expirences with the Jimmy</b>
Since I started to drive the Jimmy full time I have put 55,000 of almost trouble-free miles on it. I found that the Jimmy handles the road quite well, though it high center of gravity can made you feel like you will roll if you corner fast.

The Vortec 4.3 Liter engine provides plenity of power amd does great on gas. I average 17 city and 21 highway. We have towed tailers for drving equipment up to michigan, with out noticing much performance lost. I have notice that the A/C does put a noticable pull on the engine, which effects the performance of the vehicle.

My Jimmy also includes the shift on the fly electronic 4WD system. This is nice feature and allows you to shift into 4WD and back without slowing or stopping the truck, like I had to do with the Blazer that had the shifter on the floor. It does descent in winter conditions or it size and weight, but I have buried it before in large snow drifts. Luckly my dad came out with the Suburban and pulled me out.

The interior is nice and comfortable. We have the SLT model with includes leather seats. The seats have a air pack that fulls up to give you back support, but if you full them too much you will get a major back pain that lasts all day. The sound system is marignal but it does what I need it to do.

The cargo space is large and can be made even larger my laying down the back seat. This is nice if you hual a lot of things. I do not like the gate feature that GMC put in there vehicle though, you have to lean over the gate itself to get inside the cargo area. Also the window latch in the back has a habit of wearing out and make a terrible noise when it moves. The rear wiper though is a nice touch since dust and water like to collect in that area.

<b>It also has downsides too...</b>
The major problem with the vehicle is that it has had some recalls. One of the major ones is the recall for faulty ABS system. OTher then that I have not had any other &quot;natural&quot; problems with it.

In 1998 I was hit my a drunk driver in the front left hand side. It did $3000 damage but I was able to drive it home, but the other person's car was totalled. But ever since then I have been having trouble with the front supension, with broken and damaged parts. This is cause by the wreck but also maybe caused by the 116,000 miles that it has on it.

<b>Overall</b>
I love this truck, it is tough and full of luxury. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with a family who needs plenity of cargo space and tow power. This vehicle is safe, comfortable and a total pleasure to drive as long as you drive it the way that you should. If you mistreat it you will end up on to your top if your not careful.<br><br>
