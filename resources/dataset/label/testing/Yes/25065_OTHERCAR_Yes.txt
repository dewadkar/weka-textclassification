            top rated by recent pcmagazine article.  very well thought out with usb connector, and easy-to-use menu's.

buy the bundled version with extra battery and the 64MB card.....this is a much better deal than the standard version sold at kodak.com

camera is easy to use with excellent picture quality.

i think the USB download software to PC is very easy to use. the camera appears as an extra hardfile on windows when you plug it in.

i am also very impressed with the ability to create prints. the local camera store has a kodak print machine which can make really neat 'picture stickers'  for the kids.  www.kodak.com has easy to use upload function to send digital snapshots to kodak for photo print making. kodak's 'picture page' is really neat....it lets you create a double-sided 8 x 11 photo montage print with multiple images on it.
