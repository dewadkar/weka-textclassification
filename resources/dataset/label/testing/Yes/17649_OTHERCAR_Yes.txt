            For the family, this is a great car. The great safety and features that come with this car are excellent. Nothing breaks down and the overall quality is great. There is more roominess in the car than you think. It might look kind of small but it's definately not! The comfort is great coming with the radio, air conditioning, heater, fan and other features that can be easily put in like leather seating, sunroof, and a cd player. There's one bad thing about this car. It is kind of hard to see with the big headrests. Other than that this is a great car all comingn at an affordable price. If you want to protect the entire family this is the car for you!<br><br>
