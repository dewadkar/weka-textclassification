            I rented one of these little beauties for 4 days a few weeks ago and have to admit, I had never driven a pickup before. I had no idea what to expect. However, this little hummer really jammed. It was very powerful and made the mark in terms of performance. I was impressed with the interior space. I had no idea that trucks had become so roomy and spacious.
However, based on what I am used to- My Grand Cherokee, I must say that this truck was a bit stiff. The steering is a bit stiff and the brakes also seemed too tight for a vehicle with over 20K miles on it.
The bed on this truck was extra long and I must admit I would never get one of those, since I could not see when backing up where exactly it ended.
In general, much like the rest of American made vehicles, there is a great resemblance in the interiors of these vehicles to cars. They no longer are the stripped down editions that people once owned.
The stereo system was adequate and that was factory installed. The part that impressed me the most was the power on this vehicle. It was really impressive on the highway! There was a great sense of immediate response to the acceleration. Also, the steering was pretty tight with little play allowed on the wheel.
The leg room was also impressive. It seemed that it was designed for big tall men, at the very least. The rest of the cab that was behind the front seat was adequate to store groceries and all the stuff we haul around as Americans. However, the seats did not look like they were comfortable enough for an adult to ride in for a period longer than five minutes.  And, the adult would have to be 4'7" to be comfortable with the allocated leg room.
I liked the handling of the vehicle and felt that it really drove more like a car than a truck. It has a smooth steering mechanism and seems to park readily in tight situations. However, I did not even try to get it into my garage. I was sure that with the extra long body, it would not allow my garage door to come down.  Especially since it was a rental, I was not willing to take a chance.
Also, I did feel that the seats were not  comfortable. They seemed less padded than most auto seats I have been in in the last few years. I was surprised at that.
I have to admit that it was fun to drive, but not fun to fill. I figure that I got about 16 miles to the gallon and considering that there are many other vehicles that do LOTS better than that, I would not consider buying this truck.
