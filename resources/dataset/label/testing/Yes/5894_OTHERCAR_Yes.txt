            Own a 1998 Ram 1500 Quad Cab...wonderful truck. We use it to tow our jetskis and it handles great. You would never know you were even towing anything. It has great power with it's standard V-8 engine. The quad cab is a smart and practical way to own a truck when you have a family. No more struggling to get the kids through the small opening to the back seat. The quad cab makes it very easy to put a carseat in the back even. It has the feature so you can turn the airbag on or off...allowing added saftey for your family.
