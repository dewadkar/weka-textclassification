            To be fair, I have to say that my husband works for Toyota.   We lease this vehicle because Toyota is good to their employees.  Its a special lease and we get to trade in our car for a new model every year.  
I have had the opportunity to drive a RAV4 and a Camery, but when it came down to it, we choose the Corolla Le for our lease.  We are on our second one.  
With both Corollas, we drove across the country.  They were very comfortable trips.
Everything is well within my reach as I drive.  I'm a small person and being able to reach the radio or the cup holder with out getting into an accident is good.  The cruise control is very easy to use as well.  I love the storage space and the cup holders.
I'm a girl, so I'm not really into to performance, but I can say that it seems to have a lot of power for being a little car.  I drove a  '89 Ford Escort and it was a struggle to get up to speed on the freeway.  My 2000 Corolla is much better.
If my husband didn't work for Toyota, I would still buy a Corolla.
This vehicle is a good buy for anyone who has a long commute, plans to keep their car for years, and has a small family.<br><br>
