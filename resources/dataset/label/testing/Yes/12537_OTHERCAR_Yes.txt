            <b>BECOMING MORE AND MORE &quot;LIKE A ROCK&quot;:</b>

In their quest to become a major player in the light truck marketplace, Chevrolet has re-designed their K series line of 4X4 vehicles once again. Ever since the Chevrolet four wheel drive pick-up truck was introduced, until its first major engineering make over it was a solid axle, leaf sprung harsh riding behemoth built for work and it rode like it.

Next came the 1988 model year and the previous suspension design was completely trashed for the better riding, better handling, independently suspended, torsion bar sprung softie. This design, from 1988 till the last 1999 rolled off the assembly line was fraught with problems ranging from bad ball joints and linking arms to shock absorbers ripping themselves out of their bodies from being designed too short for the suspension travel associated with this truck. And the alignment capabilities from the factory were a blessing and a curse simultaneously, depending on if you were paying, or were the one being paid.

There was a lack of grease fittings shortening the life span of steering parts, and what looked like just a plain old lack of research and development before production began halting the ability to stop the presses.  This was of course a boon to the aftermarket, because parts suppliers and mechanics alike would salivate at the site of a 1988-1999 Chevy 4X4 rolling into the parking lot. Then came the 2000 model year and everything screeched to a halt.

<b>THE 2000-2001 CHEVROLET &quot;K&quot; SERIES 4X4 SUSPENSION:</b>

Though the 2001 <i>(re-designed for 2000)</i> Chevrolet 4X4 suspension is very closely based on the first re-design starting in 1988, it has a wonderful array of improvements.  It is still an SLA based front suspension, meaning it has a <b>S</b>hort upper and <b>L</b>ong lower control <b>A</b>rm system, hence the term SLA. It is still a torsion bar sprung vehicle also, doing away with the leaf springs of the solid front axle era.

This means that you, the owner/ driver will have a much better handling and riding truck than those of yesteryear. Though this was the story starting in 1988, the improvements starting in 2000 will keep you on the road and out of the shop better then the previous 12 years of production. 

<b><i>Following is a list of the most meaningful revisions to the suspension system that were implemented n the 2000 model year and have carried over to the 2001.</i></b>  First and foremost are the improvements to the Idler Arm. The Idler Arm starting in 1988 was the weakest link in the whole re-designed suspension from the old solid axle dinosaur predecessor <i>(Which did not have one by design)</i>. The bearing surface in the 1st generation was dubious at best and rapidly wore, dictating massive amounts of steering play and outer edge tire wear was the end result.

Beginning pre 2000 model year the Idler Arm was re-designed and this thankfully was carried over to the third generation Silverado chassis. A massive two piece Idler Arm was designed and constructed and has withstood beating and plowing snow, which is the ultimate test of how a part will hold up. Happily for you, the General Motors engineers did their homework on this link because you are the beneficiary of the wisdom.

Another improvement is in the steering linkage. The old inner and outer tie rod and center link system has been replaced by a center ling attaching to a rack and pinion style inner and outer tie rod set-up. This style is a more direct link between the steering box and your steering knuckle and it vastly improves road input and steering wheel feel. With the first re-design the suspension more resembled a cars, now it even more closely does so with this better steering system.

The shock absorber mounts are also an improvement and there is no longer a worry of the shock self-destructing over rough terrain. The further you dig into this new generation of Chevy truck the more it starts to look like a car suspension, but it is so much beefier than anything you would ever see on a car that there is no need for concern, this is one tough truck.

There are more grease fittings on this model than in any previous incarnation and this means you are able to perform preventive maintenance like never before. No more &quot;sealed for life&quot; steering and suspension parts, <i>commonly referred to in the industry as &quot;sealed for death&quot;.</i>  This set-up should offer you miles and miles of trouble free operation. 

<b>Why you and your alignment technician will love this together.</b>

In the 1988 model year, there was oblong holes hidden by welded washers where the upper control arms bolted in. This is where your alignment was supposed to be done. There was no availability to do any adjustments until the washers were removed and a cam kit was purchased. If you knocked your truck out of align, the kits and labor to get it back into spec were over $100.00. Along came the late 1989 and beyond years which supplied the cams from the factory, but the tech had to remove the control arm and remove knock-out plugs to activate the cams for re-alignment. Pain in the butt for the tech and an eighty dollar charge to align the vehicle.

I believe Chevrolet heard all of our collective shouts of disapproval and beginning with generation 3 in 2000, the new way to properly align the truck is to simply remove a plastic stopper from the crescent shaped eccentric adjuster and rock it to spec.  Now here is a bit of info for all you who own a 2000 or 2001 Chevy K 1500,2500, or 3500 truck.  If you go to get your truck aligned and the shop tells you there will be an extra charge to align it for the first time because the plastic stopper prevents the eccentric from moving, tell them to go fly a kite.  It only takes seconds to loosen the nut and pop it out and if they are at all experienced with the 1988 to 1999 welded washer/ knock out plug debacle they will be over joyed to do this for nothing.

For those not familiar with why I only review vehicle suspensions, just go read more of my auto reviews and they will tell you the story. The story on the 2000-2001 Chevrolet Silverado has been told. The suspension is becoming one that you can call superior, and it is miles ahead of anything Chevrolet has previously offered. This is by far the best thing out of General Motors Detroit and you are the ones to benefit.
