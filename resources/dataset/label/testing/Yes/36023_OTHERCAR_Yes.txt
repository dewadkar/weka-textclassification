            I have driven many cars, most Hyundais'. My first car was one that was passed down to me and was absolutely terrible, my second was a '95 Hyundai Accent which I liked except for the fact it rattled.  
I first saw the Paseo on a used car lot.  It was love at first sight.  It was a beautiful maroon color, manual, and black interior.  Unfortunately I have no credit.  The salesperson wouldn't even look at me.  I walked off the lot that day depressed more than anything, but I had a goal... I had to have a Paseo.  
A couple months had passed and on the way to work one day, I decided to drive through a car lot.  There it was... it was me!!!  A 1993 Toyota Paseo midnight blue with streaks down the side. It had everything, Sunroof, tinted windows, nice tape player, clean, it was my dream. And more importantly I felt safe! 
Eight hours later, and I drove that sporty car off the lot.  I was proud!  I was 19 and bought my very first car on my own.  It was above my range, but I wanted the car and the salesperson wanted his Christmas bonus. We were both happy.
 My family says it is a female car because of its size and style, but if you're a female and planning on having a family, this may not be an ideal car.
After buying the car, I realized... the back seat isn't very big.  It's basically a two seater.  That is the only bad thing about this car.  
I have put several thousand miles on it without having any problems.  I have taken it up steep mountains and have driven it in the snow.  It has no problem heating the engine in the snow, and it has a good grip in the rain.  
I would recommend this car to anyone wanting a sturdy safe sports car, or to the beginner driver.  <br><br>
