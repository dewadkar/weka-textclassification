             We bought our Dodge Stratus ES in Feb. 2000. I am 100% satisfied . I am   happier every day that we decided to buy it. It looks much better than  
the picture of the Stratus on this site. Ours is silver with gray and 
black interior. Most people who see it think that it is brand new. My 
husband keeps in polished and detailed at all times.
 There are many things I like about the car. 
1. It was affordable. We only paid around $8,000 for it , but it does 
   have over 100,000 miles. 
2. It runs great! It has a V6 engine, for power and speed. Watch out, its 
   easy to get a ticket. 
3. It looks so cool. Its aerodynamic shape and color give it a sporty        look. Ours is also elevated in the back. 
4. Its roomy. Even though it looks like a sports car, it has plenty of 
   room for kids and its a 4 door, so the insurance is cheaper. 
5. The ES model has a auto-stick, which means it can be driven as an 
   automatic or drop it down to the auto-stick and you can change gears 
   just like a standard. Its great for going up and down hills. 

 If you are looking to buy a used car, look for a Stratus. It's a great 
 buy.
