            My dad bought this wonderful little gem after my first car, a total Lemon.  I had a Ford Tempo for my first car and I came to believe that a car should be nothing but trouble and heartache.  However, when this car became a danger to my life, my dad ran across this little wonder.  It is a red Toyota Paseo and he named it Ruby (Because it's red and the Ruby is my birthstone).  Ruby has served me well in the year I have had her.  She has tons of get-up-and-go and is Ms. Reliable. Also, this car gets awesome gas mileage!  It is 7 yrs old and still gets about 30 to 32 miles to the gallon.  
At first,every time I got in the car, I felt lucky that it started because of my last hunk of junk. Now, I expect to have a safe and fun trip wherever I go.  My car is cute, reliable, and sporty.  I love it and recommend it to anyone!!  With the Tempo, I spent more time in the shop that actually driving.  Now I know that a car is meant to get you from point A to point B, not from point A to the mechanic's.
I have recently graduated college and gotten a great,new job.  All of my colleagues that have also recently graduated college have just purchased brand new cars.  When asked when I will get a new car, I tell them not until my precious little Ruby dies and hopefully that won't be for a long, long time.<br><br>
