                The 2000 S70 met my requirement of upscale competence. As a Senior citizen I am all too familiar with the Ford, Chevy, Plymouth world.

    This car is possibly the most distinctive appearing vehicle available today. Mazdas look like Nissans and Acuras look like Hondas. Nothing looks like a Volvo. This is a classic look which may not appeal to the younger set but allows the Senior set to reminisce about the &quot;boxy&quot; look which has left us.

    The Volvo has all the &quot;bells &amp; whistles&quot; and is finely crafted. However it's forte is &quot;Distinctive Design and appointment&quot;. 

    Some of the available options are overkill i.e. reverse looking fog light and headlight wipers. Nevertheless, what can be more eye catching than a visible accessory which is, I believe, absolutely Unique.

    This is a finely crafted machine which looks like only itself.
