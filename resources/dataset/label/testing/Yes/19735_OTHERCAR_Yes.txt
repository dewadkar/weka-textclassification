            The STS combines the best features from the top luxury imports to make one outstanding automobile.  It has the handling of a BMW, the elegance of a Jaguar, the safety of a Mercedes and the electronic sophistication of a Lexus.  While it takes the best features of the top imports it adds some of its own gadgetry such as On-Star, the Info Center, Night Vision and self adjusting seats.  The ride is quiet and smooth and the cabin appointments unmatched anywhere at any price.  You have to sit in the seats and listen to the incredible Boise sound system!  The quality and craftsmanship are first rate as well. 

Over the years I've owned BMW's, Jaguars, Volvos and the best Japanese luxury cars and I can say without reservation that the STS is the best of all of them.  <br><br>
