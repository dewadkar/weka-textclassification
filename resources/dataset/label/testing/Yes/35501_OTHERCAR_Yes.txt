            We bought this vehicle a few months before the birth of our first child.  Our other car is a Honda Civic and we were anxious to test drive the new Odyssey.  We knew we needed a larger vehicle and we were looking at either the CRV, or this one.

Right from the first test drive we knew we were going to love this van.  It drives like a car.  It has all the advantages of a van, and the fold-down rear seat was a HUGE plus.  Right down to the controls for the heat and air conditioning - Honda got it right.

We DID have one problem with this van, and that's when we tried to install our front-facing child safety seat in the second row seat.  In Canada where we live, a tether strap is mandatory on all car seats.  We discovered that in order to secure the tether strap, we had to fold down the rear seat!  Since this would reduce our 7 passenger van to a 4 passenger vehicle, it was NOT acceptable.  When we pointed out this flaw to our dealership, they agreed to shoulder a third of the cost of replacing the assembly under the seat.  Honda Canada paid a third and we paid a third.  It was a bit of a pain...but we are now able to secure our child safety seat without losing our rear bench.  They told us this flaw was fixed on the year 2000 models.

All in all, we've been very happy with our Odyssey.<br><br>
