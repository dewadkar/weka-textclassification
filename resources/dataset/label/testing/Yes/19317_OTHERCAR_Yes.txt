            I did a lot of research on digital cameras before I decided to buy the Fuji MX-1400 and am extremely pleased with my choice! The camera is lightweight and very user-friendly. I have my 14 year old daughter using it take pictures at football games to post on my website and they are turning out great. 
I do recommend that buy an additional memory smartcard unless you plan on taking low resolution pictures. I also recommend that you purchase some rechargeable batteries and a AC power supply otherwise battery cost will eat you up. 
One of the features that I particularly enjoy is the high quality 1.6&quot; color LCD monitor on the back of the camera. It allows you to immediately review the quality of the picture you just took. I've always been frustrated with wondering just how good is the picture I just took. It also is a great training tool for teaching others to take qality pictures.  <br><br>
