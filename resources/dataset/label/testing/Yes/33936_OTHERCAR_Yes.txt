            Way back in the day, I owned a 1971 VW Bug. It was small, noisy, had no heat or defroster, and the windshield wash was powered by the air in the spare tire under the hood. But I loved that car. For some reason many people fell in love with the VW Bug, and I was one of them. After a few years when I �grew up�, I got rid of the old bug and got a �real car�. I think it was my girlfriend always complaining about the cold breeze that would whistle through the dashboard as we drove down snowy winter roads.

A couple of years later I found myself missing the old bug, so I went out and found myself another one. A �73 this time. It needed work so I did it all up nice and custom like. That car was great and I never would have gotten rid of it except that my company moved me so I had a 45 mile commute. The bug was NOT a highway cruiser.

Well, it�s years later and I�ve been watching the �New Beetle� become as much of a craze as the old ones ever were. I wanted one but I had become a truck man. I couldn�t see getting by without a truck. Then it happened. I got a new job. Once again I had a 45 mile commute to work each day. My truck was sucking gas like Jeff at pool (OHHH did I say that out loud?). I had to do something. Ironically, unlike the old bugs, the new beetles are awesome on the highway, and they get decent gas mileage. So I bought one, and here is my review of it.

Nothing else like it

A glance will tell you that the new beetle is unlike anything else on the road today. It�s reminiscent of the old bug but with very up to date styling. It�s smooth lines and simple curves make you want to touch it.

Comfy comfy

The first thing you notice when you get inside is the ROOM. Lots of it. Way more than you would expect. The new beetle is much wider than the old ones giving the driver and passengers much more elbow room. The seats are very comfortable and fully adjustable in every direction imaginable. The steering wheel adjusts both tilt AND telescopic allowing the driver to center that cute little instrument pod in the wheel perfectly. Even the back seat area has ample room for an average adult and the rear head rests provide added protection as well as a nice place to rest your head for a snooze.

WHOA! Check out that dash!

Adding to the roomy feel of the NB is the kitchen table sized dashboard. It�s huge! Seriously, you could crawl up there and take a nap if you were so inclined. I guess that�s how they were able to make the front of the car so small and cute .. THE ENGINE IS UNDER THE DASH!
Once you get over the size of the dash, you realize that the instrument panel is the complete opposite. Within a cute little circle no more than 10 inches round, they managed to squeeze all of the readouts in an easily viewable fashion. Speedometer, tach, gas gage, directionals, dummy lights, etc. all right there to be viewed at a single glance. The real surprise, though, comes at night. When you turn the lights on for the first time it�s nothing less than the feeling you get plugging in the Christmas tree. The instrument panel and literally every control, gage, button, switch, and knob are illuminated in a blue glow with contrasting bright red edges. It�s �wicked cool� as my son Brian says.

While we�re on the dashboard, let�s not forget about the stereo. It�s molded and curved right into the dash panel. This stereo is made specifically for the NB by Clarion. In a word ..KICKS ASS. Ok that�s 2 words. Really, for a stock stereo it�s awesome. AM/FM Cassette with controls for a CD changer, which is pre-wired by the factory to go in the trunk. It has an 8 speaker system with tweeters up front and woofers in the back. Combined with an 8 disc Panasonic CD changer, it makes the commute bearable.

You can do a lot with 115hp

The new beetle (mine is a 2.0L) takes advantage of all 115 horses under the hood by combining it with a finely tuned 5 speed gear box. The gear ratio is relatively high giving the beetle more torque at higher speeds. The engine revs high but is designed for it. Approximately 4000rpms at 80mph. Is high but if you didn�t look at the tach, you�d never know it. The acceleration is smooth through all 5 gears. 

Smooooove

The New beetle gives a surprisingly smooth ride for a car it�s size. Road noise is minimal even at highway speeds (90mph for some of us). It glides along as if it weighed a thousand pounds more than it does. When I take anyone for their first ride in a NB, usually they will comment on how nice it rides.

Trunk space? PLENTY !!

Unlike the old bugs, the NB�s engine is in the front of the car. That left VW plenty of room in the back to create a decent size trunk with a convenient hatch for access. The trunk, as is, is big enough to fit several road kill or one good size child comfortably. (Oh boy, here comes the DCYF) If you need more room, no problemo .. just fold the back seat down (the bottom goes up and the back goes down) and viola, you have enough room for an elephant. Ok, a small elephant.

Safety

The NB is rated one of the safest cars on the road today. It�s solid. You can feel that when you drive it or ride in it. VW packed all of the body panels and fenders with High Impact Foam. Every orifice is filled with the stuff. The driver and side passenger are surrounded by airbags both front and sides. I don�t want to find out how safe they are in a crash but all this sounds pretty good to me.

In conclusion �

I am very pleased with the New Beetle. I love to drive it and it�s serving it�s purpose by saving me on gas (about 28 mph average). I have had one problem with it so far. The Coil Pack or some such nonsense crapped out. It had to be replaced at a whopping $250.00 ,which was NOT covered under warranty. I have filed a report with VW about this and am waiting for them to investigate it. Hopefully I will get reimbursed for it. Other than that it�s been pretty good.

If I had to say anything bad about the NB I guess it would be that most people look at it as a �chick car�. This is unfortunate since it�s really kinda sporty. I always hear �That�s YOUR car??� and �YOU drive a BEETLE??�. I take a lot of razzing from the boys and I have to admit this does get to me and I do find myself missing my truck. I may cave to peer pressures and trade the bug in on a new truck someday but for the purpose of this review, I have to say the New Beetle is a great little car that I�d recommend to anyone. Girls OR guys.

I hope you liked my first epinion. Sorry it was so long. I�ll have to work on that in future works.

Thanks
