<TEXT>
            I have the 1998 model of Mitsubishi Montero Sport.
In the past I owned several other SUVs and I am proud to declare
that none of them have the comfort and road handling of this vehicle.
It is reliable with lots of room inside. It is quick and smooth, none of this 'bumpy' travel as with the new Xtera from Nissan.
An A+ and a good recommendation for all of you with small children. This is the SUV for you.<br>
