            The Casio Exilim EX-S3 is the beginning of the new generation of digital cameras. Combining compact size and image capacity, this is the digital camera to get.

SIZE: 
The EX-S3 is the first camera of its kind to be able to fit in a wallet. If you stack up 10 credit cards, you get the size of this camera. Whenever I am on the go, I just slip it into my back pocket and I&#146m gone. It also doesn&#146t have any attachments, which gives you even less to carry. The exact dimensions are 89.5mm(W) x 57mm(H) x 11.7mm(D). The lens is 7.1mm, which is in proportion to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera. To add on to the amazingly small and efficient size of the camera, it is also as light as a feather. The camera weighs 72 grams. This camera doesn&#146t have all of the add-ons that you can get with a regular camera such as a tripod or different lenses. This guitar just has the bare necessities. If you need all of the other attachments, get a different camera.

IMAGES:
All of the EX-S3&#146s come with a dock that plugs into the computer through a USB input. While in the dock, the camera can be charged, or photos can be imported onto the computer. Another thing that the EX-S3 can do is take video. As you put your pictures onto the computer, they are saved as JPEG, DCF standard, or DPOF compliant. When you put your video on the computer, it is saved as AVI (Motion JPEG). There are many image sizes (in pixels) that you can have. Pictures can be 2,048 x 1,536; 1,600 x 1,200; 1,280 x 960 or; 640 x 480. The movies can be 320 x 240. The maximum length of a movie is 30 seconds long. If you are bummed out about this and you want longer movies, then buy a camcorder. The camera has 3.2 megapixels. That equals 3,200,000 pixels. Did you every wonder why the picture on the screen was so grainy? That is because of the digital zoom. The camera can zoom in or out 4x without the lens moving. When you put the pictures on the computer, the graininess will be completely gone. The zoom though is nothing like an optical zoom, which works much better

MEMORY:
One thing I like about the EX-S3 is its memory. Even though it only comes with 10MB of built-in memory, you can buy compact flash cards for it. Those can go from 32MB to a GIG (About 1000MB). There is a chart on Casio.com where they show you how much space each type of picture can take up depending on resolution, and Image size (pixels). 

OTHER:
The EX-S3 has 15 different recording modes. They are: 1.Portrait 2.Scenery 3.Portrait With Scenery 4.Coupling Shot 5.Pre-Shot 6.Pet 7.Flower 8.Natural Green 9.Sundown 10.Night Scene 11.Night Scene Portrait 12.Fireworks 13.Monochrome 14.Retro 15.Twilight. This camera also has built in flash. There are several flash modes you can have such as auto; flash on, flash off, or red eye reduction. There is also a timer so you can get into pictures that you took. You can make the timer countdown from 10 seconds or 2 seconds. The monitor on the camera is really nice. It is a 2.0-inch flat screen, TFT color LCD, and has 84,960 pixels (354 x 240).

BUNDLES:
When you buy the camera, you get some accessories with it, but remember you only get the bare essentials. You get a Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery (NP-20) a
USB Cradle (to put the camera in), a Special AC Adaptor, a Strap, a Special USB Cable, and a Dummy Card. You also get some software such as Photo Loader 2.1 for Windows, Photo Loader 1.1 for Macintosh, Photohands 1.0 for Windows, USB driver 1.0 for Windows, and USB driver 2.1 for Macintosh.

OVERALL:
My overall opinion on this camera is if you are looking for a small camera that you can just put in your pocket and go, this is the one. If you are looking for a digital camera for business use, don&#146t get this one. Get a really good camera. I am not saying the EX-S3 is a bad camera, I am just saying it is not something I would use for my job. Also, if you don&#146t need all of the little parts and numerous accessories, get this camera because this camera comes with only the essentials. This is definitely a recreational camera, a good one too!
