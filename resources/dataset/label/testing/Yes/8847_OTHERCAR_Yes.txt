            The 00 Accord is actually my first car, and I could not be more happy that it is. I drive a stick shift Accord, and this car never EVER has jerky starts. I have only stalled a few times in the last 3 months, and I'm pretty sure that it's because of a zippy first gear, although most of the gears go smoothly, and without problems.

I'm not too into the mechanics of the car, since I'm not really a car person, but I can tell you, this thing gets INCREDIBLE gas mileage for a car of its size, around 32-35 mpg. Right now, when fuel prices are so killer, it's nice to see a midsized car that doesn't eat your gas and your money.

From what I've read in the Wall Street Journal, the Accord rated the BEST of midsized cars in flipovers, meaning that this is one SAFE car. I feel a lot more comfortable in my Accord, now, knowing that the monstrous SUVS that plow by me every day can't break me in half too easily. That makes me feel great.

The interior is cushy and cozy, and roomy enough to VERY comfortably seat 5 adults. The heating system works quite well, the stereo's great, and it has as many cup holders as you could possibly need.

I already mentioned, I'm not too into the mechanics of this car, or any other car. All I know is that it's safe, economical, and comfy, as well as nice looking. It's great if you have a small family, or if you live by yourself and want a nice affordable car.<br><br>
