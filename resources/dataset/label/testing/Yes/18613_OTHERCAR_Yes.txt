            We have just recently purchased an Oldsmobile Alero.  This was a 99 model used car but with only 27k on the OD we decided it might be worth a try.  Boy what an experiance!  The overall handling of the vehicle was very impressive.  For being rated a compact car this baby had some power!  Try 0-60 in 8.0 sec (rated Car and Driver) with the 2.4 liter 4cyl she was waiting for the green light.  The cornering is fantastic.  with the 16&quot; goodyear tires this make for an all round performance on the cornering.  The variable assisted steering makes any curve seem nonexsitant!  With all the goodies this car really made the grade and I decided to take it.  We ended up paying 12590 with manufacture warranty compared to 18k new.  Recently we took it for a road trip and the ride was smooth and relaxed.  The one thing we did notice is that it does tend to be easy to oversteer.
The reaction of the steering is extreemly sensitive.  Other than that it may just be that we need to get used to it.  We found that this is a great car for people who still want some serious class but the pocket book doesn't seem to say so.  The mileage is great on the highway but tends to deminish greatly in town.  We haven't had any snow in MN this winter yet so we haven't been able to try the electronic traction.  the dual air bags make for some good safety concerns.  We purchased the four door and the back seats are very comfortable and roomy (makes for great family car).  For all the small car owners out there this is the perfect step up from a box on wheels!  But if your concerned about gas mileage in town i wouldn't recomend it.<br><br>
