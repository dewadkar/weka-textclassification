            After over 20 years of owning Honda vehicles (Civic/Accord), I recently purchased a 2000 CRV.  I had actually made a &quot;short list&quot; of other vehicles to test drive, but the CRV was my first and my last stop! I chose the CRV for a number of reasons -Dependability: Honda makes a quality product that doesn't leave you stranded.  If you maintain the vehicle with regular tune-ups/oil changes, etc., you won't be disappointed and it will outlast the Energizer Bunny!Ratings:  I did my homework before purchasing the CRV. I visited many auto-related and SUV sites to find out what other consumers and industry professionals had to say about the vehicle.  I found that the CRV was well-rated for its' class (mini-SUV) and that most owners were very satisfied with their purchase.  Now, understand that I did not purchase an SUV to go 4-wheeling.  This CRV will travel on city streets, highways and byways, but not through mountain terrain.  Bang for your Buck:  The CRV is reasonably priced and offers great gas mileage.  This is good news, considering that the price of gasoline is climbing higher every day!Good Stuff:  This vehicle is fun to drive. Actually, it drives like a car.  You don't feel like you are driving a big, clumsy SUV.  The interior is very roomy.  For those of you who have driven the Civic/Accord, the dash lay-out will be very familiar and accessible.  There are many imaginative &quot;nooks and crannies&quot; in the CRV.  You will find a place to keep all of your &quot;stuff&quot; and the built-in table is a fun feature.The Downside: Can someone from Honda please explain why the passenger-side armrest is an optional feature?  How ridiculous is that?  Although you can always &quot;add on&quot;, I feel that Honda should have spent the extra $60 and made it a standard feature.  I have also found that opening the back hatch can be confusing for some...especially when getting your car washed.  Most people won't realize that you must first open the window portion, then open the hatchdoor.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this fun little SUV! :)<br><br>
