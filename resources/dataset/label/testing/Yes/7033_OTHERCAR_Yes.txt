<TEXT>
            In 1995 I purchased a certified preowned LS400 from a local Lexus dealer. The car had only 6500 miles and I was able to inspect the entire repair history.  The car now has 65,000 miles and has been all I hoped for.  Its luxury is obvious.  Maintenace costs are quite reasonable and the car has been incredibly reliable.  I just had my first repair (a new alternator) and it was covered by the extended warrantee that came with the car.  Service is a dream with polite personnel, clean and comfortable surroundings and appointments kept to the minute.  Whenever I get around to needing a new one, I'll certainly be back to Lexus.  I only wish that the model I have came with heated front seats and traction control for this money (they are options).  The CD player in the dash is great! <br><br>
