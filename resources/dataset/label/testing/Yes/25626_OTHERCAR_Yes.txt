            <b>Honesty Disclaimer: I do not own this vehicle, I simply drove one for a couple of days about a year ago, so bear that in mind up front!</b>

When I was stationed over in Germany I had the pleasure of seeing, learning, and experiencing a lot of new things.  I got to experience a different culture, see new places that I had previously only heard about, and experience such wonderful things as driving on the famous Autobahns.  Another thing I got to do while there was to experience owning/driving European cars.  I personally owned an old BMW, which was an experience, but not a good one per se.  SO whenever I wanted to travel somewhere, or had to pick up a new person (or drop off an old person) at the airport in Frankfurt, I rented a car.  Normally I would rent an Explorer, if possible, which led me to buy the vehicle I own now, but sometimes (since they were popular) I couldn't do that and would end up with something else.  I liked driving the new BMW's, while I am not a big BMW fan, and wasn't overly impressed with them, there is just something about driving a BMW on the Autobahn at well over 100 MPH....anyway, that's another review maybe.  Well one day I had to pick up a new person, and I was planning on using the car the second day to travel with a friend.  They had no Explorers, and no BMWs, so they offered me this Saab.  Now I had never driven a Saab and I didn't really like them, based on looks alone.  You know how Saabs have those rounded back ends?? Yeah well, I think looks are very important when it comes to a car, since (unlike humans) they have no personality, looks and functionality are important.  SO I wasn't too thrilled, but when I got the key and walked on out to the car I started to change my mind right away.  The first thing I noticed is that this particular car does not have that rounded, weird back end - it looked more like a normal car, and this little change made it look quite nice.


<b>Looking around the interior</b>
I noticed a lot of things and, having rented the aforementioned BMWs before, I began to compare right away.  First off, this car has cupholders!!!  Apparently Americans are the only people in the world who want cupholders - and lots of them!  Most foreign cars don't have them, why I don't know, you would think that all people in the world drink, in the car even, but maybe not??  Anyway the seats were leather (this was a nicely loaded version) and not only that, but the seats had heaters for those cold mornings in Germany when leather would not be so much of a luxury anymore.  Temp controls were separate for the driver and passenger and were also automatic.  Set the temp you want, and let it cool/warm as needed - which in some cars doesn't work too well, but in this case it seemed to work quite well, the vehicle did a good job of keeping the desired temp.  Controls for the radio were easy to use and all of the key ones (volume, change station, and CD player controls) were located on the steering wheel, which was quite handy.  The seats were comfortable and easy to spend time in - leather is nice, though I don't know if I would ever want to own a car that had leather seats, especially in a hot climate - who want's to stick to their seat?? Not me.  All other controls were easy to reach, easy to use, and all quite functional.

<b>Handling and ride</b>
Both quite good for this car!  It handled like a dream, took corners well, and gripped the road with determination.  The ride was exceptionally quite, only the most minimal of air noise, and it went over bumps with ease - I could barely feel them!  The suspension was taking care of business - smoothing out those bumps and potholes and making it a crisp, clean ride.

<b>Performance</b>
This car performed like a dream!  Acceleration was great, I don't know how fast it gets from 0-60 or anything like that, but I bet it's quite quick.  No problems with braking, I had a time when I had to hit them pretty hard and it stopped with no problem.  The engine was powerful, quite obviously, but wasn't making all kinds of noise that could be heard in the car.  The transmission was one of those odd inventions where you can either shift or use it as an automatic.  If you select manual it will still shift if you forget, but it give you the opportunity to shift if you want - which isn't real shifting, basically you move the stick forward to upshift and back to downshift - that's as intense as it gets.  If you choose automatic, of course it's like any other automatic.

<b>Interior from a different view</b>
What I mean here is, how about the trunk? The backseats? Things like that.  Well the trunk had plenty of room for most anything - and the backseat folded down in one part so if you wanted to put, say skis, in there it would be easy to do.  Luggage and a dead body (haha, just making sure you're still awake) would fit easily in the trunk.  As for the back seats - plenty of leg room there, regardless of where the front seats were located.  Very comfy interior all the way around - and it also had a nice moonroof!!

<b>Overall opinion</b>
As you might have guessed by now, this is going to be a recommended product from me.  It's a great car that rides well, looks nice, has all kinds of wonderful, convenient features, and would make a nice addition to anyone's garage.  Of course it is a luxury car, so how many of us can afford it is beyond me - I know I couldn't.  Truth be told, I don't know how much this car costs, since I don't own it and never did, BUT I know from talking to them at the rental agency it costs less than the 5 series BMWs they had and it is much nicer - I can say that having used both.  If you are looking for a luxury car, European specifically, and are considering a BMW - you might want to rethink that.  This car is better in so many ways, I highly recommend at least checking into it.
