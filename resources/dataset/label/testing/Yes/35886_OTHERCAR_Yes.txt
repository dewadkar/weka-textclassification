            I owned a Ford Probe for many years.  It was my first real car (not counting the 1981 Ford Fairmont I had in high school) and it led me to make some false assumptions that the Jeep has shattered.  <br>
First, the Probe required about $1000.00 per year to pass inspection.  Something was always wrong, and that was when I drove about 5,000 miles a year.  My Jeep, bought last year with 98,000 miles on it, has been trouble-free.  Now I drive about 15,000 miles a year.<br>
Second, I thought the Probe was fuel-efficient.  I got about 22 MPG.  The only trepidation I had with buying a Jeep was that I knew it'd be bad on mileage.  I get about 18 MPG, and really that's no different from my "sports" car Probe.  It's not great, but it isn't THAT bad.<br>
Thirdly, I didn't think I would ever need 4 wheel drive.  Wrong!  I have called upon the Jeep's 4WD twice so far and it was as simple as anything.  Now I feel much more confident driving alone, anywhere.<br>
I love the Jeep's boxy shape and its feeling of being high up.  There's no feeling of too high, though, like I might tip on a corner. <br>
The only thing I don't like is that the windows and door locks are manual.  That's a drag.  But I have an air bag, which the Probe didn't.<br>
I recommend the Jeep Cherokee.  It's simply a fun, dependable, safe vehicle.
