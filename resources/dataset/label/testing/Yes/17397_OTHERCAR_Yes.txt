            My dad has a 1998 Toyota 4Runner LTD, but I get to drive every so often.  I think this is one of the nicest 4x4 vehicles I've ever had the pleasure of driving.

This certainly isn't the biggest machine available... in fact, I would place it as a compact SUV, if not for vehicles such as the RAV4 and anything Suzuki was out there.

The LTD has everything a luxury car owner would ever want:  Leather seats, CD/Cassette six speaker stereo, sliding moonroof, great comfort in both the front and rear seats, and a nice, quiet ride.  The family has taken some very long road trips (Colorado to Florida and back), and you don't get uncomfortable sitting in the car that long.

The LTD has everything a 4x4 owner would ever want:  Shift-on-the-fly four wheel drive, locking rear wheel differential, some good height (for ground clearance), a somewhat heavy and sturdy vehicle.  My father has slid off the road at very low speeds (on icy roads) and struck trees or rocks, and nothing worse than a minor ding has shown up on the truck.

The LTD comes with no options.  The only choice you get is what color you'd like the vehicle.  However, there's nothing you'd WANT to add, short of a towing package (which my father's vehicle happens to have).  Toyota has, in my opinion, shoved in every conceivable option a car could possibly have into their LTD.

When this vehicle really comes into its own element is in the snow.  We live in Colorado, and having a few feet of snow fall overnight isn't exactly uncommon.  4-High will get you in and out of most situations, but when the snow is REALLY deep, you'll be glad 4-Low is available.  While you can't do more than about 20mph in 4-Low without risking damage to the transmission, if the snow conditions are that poor, you're stupid if you're going that fast anyhow.

Aside from regular maintenance, this particular LTD has experienced **no** visits to the shop, despite putting on nearly 50,000 miles.

This vehicle does not drive like a truck... in fact, it drives more like a mid-sized sedan.  Parking is a cinch, as the frame is no larger than my Ford Taurus.  It handles corners very well, unlike many trucks, you don't have to take wide turns.

The LTD is an expensive machine, and while there are less-pricey models out there, I think this is a fantastic snow cat!
