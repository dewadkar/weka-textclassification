            I bought my RAV4 10 months ago, and have fallen in love with it.  I drive about 900 miles a week, and it's the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned.  I struggled with a decision between the Honda CRV and the RAV, finally deciding on the RAV4 because of it's appearance and Toyota's outstanding warranty.  It hugs the road and corners like a race car!  If you are looking for horsepower, however, you should consider another make SUV.  At 126 HP, you might be the last one out of the starting gate.  But, once you get going, it's smooth sailing.  The leg room in the rear seating area is not the best, the the front is quite comfortable.  The only thing that usually rides in my back seat is my bridfcase, so it's fine for me.  All that, and it's cute to!  The Quicksilver is a dream to keep clean.  I would definitely recommend this vehicle to women.  Very easy to maintain.<br><br>
