                I had a 1994 Grand Cherokee until last year and now that I bought this new and improved version, I can truly say that this Jeep can tackle anything. I have been on numerous trips with my family and they have all been practically worry-free because of the great 4 wheel drive, smooth ride, and other great features that improve driving quality.

     First of all, the reason I bought this new version of the same model I had for a couple of years was because the previous version I had offered great performance with fabulous suspension, a powerful engine, good turning, and the rugged feel to go along with the smooth and refined ride that all jeeps offer.

    Other nice features that this SUV offers are the spacious seating arrangement, the large trunk that is very useful in a wide range of scenarios, the CD player, The 4WD option, and as always, a smooth, high performance ride for anybody who wants one.<br><br>
