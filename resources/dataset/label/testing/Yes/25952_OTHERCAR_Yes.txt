            I saw the Grand Am and I just had to have it.  The Grand Am is made for the single-stylish individual, who is always on the run.  I have the SE Coupe, and it has plenty o'power! It is very comfortable driving long distances, too.  I drove to South Carolina and back without problems.  The gas mileage is great too! On a highway about 28 m/p/gallon, and roughly the same in the city - a little lower.  This car is not made for the large family or even children, because the back seat is not roomy. The trunk is just right!  If you are young couples or single, you should experience this car.
I go for style, price and reliability, and the Pontiac Grand Am is the way to go.  It is sleek and safe.  Never felt uncomfortable in snow or rain.  I had a 1991 Grand Am as my first car.  It had 70,000 miles on it when I purchased it and the only problem I had was the serpentine belt, which broke because of wear and tear.   Too bad I traded it in on a Ford.
Previously, I had a 1996 Ford Taurus and bought it used.  I invested too much money in breaks and break pads every year.  Don't ever buy a Ford.  <br><br>
