            Ever since my friends had trucks I wanted one too.  Just this past Spring I leased my first truck, a 1999 Chevy S10.  The price was right, but the insurance was pricey.  I still love my S10 though.  

I have not had any problems with it since I bought.  The only money I have put into it (besides gas) is a tannau cover and the regular 3,000 mile oil change.  No problems have occurred with my truck and it has more than been worth all the hours I put into working to afford it.

Since I have gotten it I have had to move to and from school.  The bed in this thing is amazing.  Well for me any ways.  I have hauled everything from sofas, to building materials, to clothes for school.  

The gas mileage this thing gets is great too.  I am able to drive around for almost 2 weeks without out filling up the tank again.  The only thing that I really wished was changed was the power.  I have seen other people complain about the same thing.  I have a 4 cylinder 4x2, with a 5-speed.  It does get a little sluggish when hauling heavy load.
