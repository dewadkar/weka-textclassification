            I have been searching for a digital camera within my budget for nearly a year. The Kodak DC215 was on sale for $269 and I decided to check it out. After a few minuets in the store I was hooked! It is just so simple to use, basically put the batteries in and the memory card and snap away! 
The memory that came with it allows me to save 24 high resolution photos and about 35 medium resolution, I have no use for low res. photos so I have no idea how many it allows you to save.

And transferring them to the computer couldn't be easier, just plug it in and go! I am so pleased with this camera!

<b>Problems I've encountered:</b>
The only problem with the camera is it eats batteries! I have prolly spent more on batteries then I would have on film and developing with a normal camera. There is no money saving with a digital camera, it's a matter of convinience, no going to the store and waiting for pictures that you really don't like to begin with. With the digital you see the picture right away and you decide if you want to keep or delete it.<br><br>
