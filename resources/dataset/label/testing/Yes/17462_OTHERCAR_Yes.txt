            For about six months, I've been scanning the marketplace looking to find a suitable replacement for my aging GMC Jimmy, which was getting expensive to maintain at 148,000 miles. 
Because I'm now a father and need to haul stuff around, I looked at the various minivans, even rented a Windstar to do a road trip to Oregon.  I have friends who own Chrysler, Chevrolet, Toyota and Oldsmobile minivans, so I've been able to test what I like and dislike about these.  In addition, I kept the idea of a Chevy Tahoe/ GMC Yukon in the back of my mind.  I even test drove several of these and contemplated buying a $34,000 SUV.  

But in the end, the Sedona won me over.  With the price of $21,000 ($23489 out the door.), and an impressive array of features, I needed to consider it.  The engine - a derivative of the engine used in the Mitsubishi Montero - has plenty of power and torque to get me where I want to go.  In addition, because I tow a small tent trailer for camping, I have the comfort of built-in transmission and oil cooler units.  The engine is rated at 195HP, the same as my '95 Jimmy 4x4.  I notice the 5-speed automatic takes better advantage of the DOHC design and I get a really smooth shifting experience. It feels like I have a lot more power than I did in the Jimmy. It is similar to my wife's '99 Maxima.  While talking about the engine, I notice that all fluids are easily accessible from the front.  The battery and fuses can be replaced without major frustration.  The front headlights can be replaced without needing an engineering degree or a major toolkit.  Finally - on the engine - my local Kia dealer is offering free oil changes for the first ten years of ownership.  Oh, and let's not forget the four-bolt liquid engine mounts.  Really cuts down on vibration and engine noise. I appreciate that while cranking up my eight-speaker CD stereo system.  (BTW - who the heck has 24 radio stations that can be preset? )  The only thing I'm concerned about is that the '94 - '98 Mitsubishi Montero trucks (with the same engine) have been noticing some valve seal wear when they are reaching 80 - 100K miles.  This isn't much of a problem in itself, just that the labor is fairly expensive to replace the seals.  Now, Mitsubishi may have fixed this albeit minor problem but we won't know for several years.  Heck, compared to the fuel injector mess I went through on my Jimmy (Anybody with a 4.3L V6 CPI engine will tell you about it.), a valve seal problem sounds like a dream.

Road noise is acceptable.  I can't complain because - being a minivan - there's a lot of car right above the road.  It's not a sedan.  The drive is nice.  I drove it over several really bad roads and it handled well. I went into and out of some serious dips and the five-link MacPherson suspension let me off with the right combination of softness and responsiveness.  I've even taken it as fast as possible around the corners and not noticed too much body roll. (Try that in a 4x4!)

Interior features - all gauges are easy to read.  The eight way power seats in front provide me with good comfort. I'm 6'4" (193cm) so I like room. I feel I have it here. The stereo is excellent.  The front and rear air have easy to access controls.  I only wish there was a fuel pressure gauge.  The overhead console has some nifty features with the thermometer, clock, trip computer and mileage indicator. I only wish that it had a compass as well. I'm used to that in the Jimmy.  In addition, the console has a place for my sunglasses and a homelink thingy that will allow me to program my garage door when I clear out the crap in my garage.

Finally, they threw in as standard equipment an alarm system.  Pretty cool.  

The Kia dealer I worked with (Claremont Kia/Ford) was really helpful.  I used their internet pricing so I got a price under sticker and a little above invoice.  Something that can't be done through the "sharks" standing around the lot.  Sherry, my internet manager, said you could also call for fleet pricing.  It was great - when I walked in with my wife and baby, all paperwork was printed out and waiting for us to sign. The car was ready, and we were in and out in less than an hour. I had done my test drives previous, so I knew what I wanted.

I'd highly recommend it, and I've only had it one day.  Assuming there are no major mechanical problems that arise in the next couple of years, I'm hoping to keep this for awhile.  Maybe I'll go find me a '66 - '69 blazer to be satisfied.
