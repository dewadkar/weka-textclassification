            What to say about a great car, I have lots.  First off my pros really outweigh my cons.  This is one of the better cars I've driven.  I'm not being biased either just because it was the first car I owned.  I bought this car earlier this year with nothign to expect, just a couple of good reviews and some nice looks on the car.  I selected the GS model with the V-6, I couldnt deal with having a smaller engine, I needed a little bit of power for my car.  The pickup is very nice on this car, I can get to 100 in a short span of time.  
Fuel economy is great on this car as well, it has the best of both worlds having a decent engine and being only a 1.8 litre car it doesnt consume large amounts of fuel.  I can fill it up on 20-25 dollars.
  Interior is nice, the control panel is all leather.  Other ameneties present are an optional moonroof.  Which I reccomend to any car enthuiast because of those hot summer days when you just want to let the wind go through the car and jsut drive.
  All in all I'm totally impressed with this car.  I'd reccomend it to anyone looking for an affordable car that looks like its expensive and can do a lot fo the tricks an expensive car can do.
Cons are the weatherstripping on the doors always seems to be coming off, and I've had some problems with the computer acting up, problems that can be over looked.<br><br>
