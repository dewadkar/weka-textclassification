            <b>O.K. I've given them enough time</b> to build a reputation now, and I think it's time to do a review on the Chrysler P.T. Cruiser suspension. First off there has been a whole lot of noise spoken saying <b><i>&quot;The P.T.Cruiser is nothing but a Neon underneath.&quot;</b></i> Many say it is so, Chrysler vehemently denies the charge. The &quot;official&quot; word is the P.T.Cruiser is <i>&quot;based on the Neon platform.&quot;,</i> This means at best it is a direct or indirect copy of the Neon suspension. At worst it is the exact suspension disguised with different part numbers to throw all concerned off the scent.

I did a little investigation today for this review, and as I guessed no actual part numbers cross over from the Neon to the P.T. Cruiser. But this doesn't really mean a thing. Many times automobiles differing only one year in production will have completely different part numbers for any chassis or steering part in the dealer computers. but when you measure all the particular angles, tapers etc. you will see it is in fact the exact same part, save for some internal refinements and improvements.

When you get into aftermarket replacement parts this is where many theories are confirmed. No aftermarket company wants an extensive list of part numbers, so they apply the same number to every year the part in applicable to. For instance you may find ten factory part numbers in the progression of years for one particular vehicles tie rod. Then when you look in the parts catalog for a replacement unit, there is one number that covers every year that vehicle was made for that particular part. Even though no parts cross over in the dealer computer from the Neon to the P.T. Cruiser, I suspect when aftermarket parts become available, many will directly cross over. I may be wrong, so only time will tell.

And right about now you are saying who really cares, and right about now I am saying not me ! All that really matters is, is the P.T. Cruiser really just a Neon underneath ? When Chrysler says it is based on the Neon platform, that it is <b>NOT</b> a Neon what are they trying to say ? are they trying to hide something ? I really doubt it, I just think they are just trying to promote this vehicle as a concept car gone public. And who can really blame them. 

The first time I saw the P.T. Cruiser I instantly fell in love with the looks of it. I figured &quot;there's a fifty thousand dollar vehicle&quot;. But then the Neon rumors started, and when I finally was able to work on one with a decent amount of mileage on it I was not impressed, but at the same time did not dismiss it. Though the Neon is no Eurosedan, it is not a piece of junk either, it is a fine vehicle for its class.

Those familiar with my auto reviews already know I only review the suspensions of the vehicles. For those not familiar, I am a certified steering and suspension mechanic, and this is my job 45-50 hours per week. Elbow deep in the grease and grime of your cars suspension is where I make my living, and spend way too much time as far as I'm concerned. So let's concentrate for now on the P.T. Cruiser.

<b>THE P.T. CRUISER SUSPENSION:</b>
<b>1. Front:</b>

I was really hoping for some kind of revolutionary suspension to compliment the street rod styling. Alas, it was not to be. Not only is it not avant guard, it is almost as retro as the 40s looking body panels. I am not writing it off by any means, but if you were hoping for this glowing, warm and fuzzy review, it is not going to happen. 

The P.T.Cruiser nearly mimics the Neon suspension in front. You get a standard MacPherson strut/coil spring set-up with a weak anti roll bar system and none too impressive links. Chrysler will throw at you some engineering vernacular in an attempt to impress, like &quot;high roll center&quot; and &quot;Low-lean geometry&quot;, but the bottom line is, it is still for all intents and purposes a Neon suspension. But this is not inherently a bad thing, it is just not spectacular as many of us hoped.

You also get, as with almost every other front wheel drive vehicle rack and pinion steering. The mounting of the rack is such that it operates through suspension travel keeping very horizontal and this will aid in lowering wear on the inner tie rods. If this plays out like the Neon has, you will not have systematic problems with the inner tie rods, but at the same time with no grease fittings to help in preventive maintenance, the outer tie rods will not brag of longevity.

Ball joints also have no capacity for grease, but along with the &quot;Neon platform&quot; they seem to hold up very well. I have seen some Neons with over 150,000 miles on them and apart from the outer tie rods there is no recurring theme of across the board problems.  Where the P.T. Cruiser falls short though, is in the rear suspension.

<b>2. Rear:</b>

If Chrysler were trying to distance itself from the Neon tag, it didn't do well with the front suspension. If Chrysler were trying to impress us, they would have done themselves proud by copying the Neon rear suspension. They did neither. The Neon has a nice four wheel independant suspension. The P.T. Cruiser does not. The rear suspension on the P.T. Cruiser is nothing more than a straight axle, much like the older Chrysler &quot;K&quot; cars of old. Granted there have been technological improvements since then, but for a 2001 model year vehicle especially one promoted with this much hype, one would hope for much more.

Chrysler will again throw at you some engineer speak. Things like &quot;Twist beam rear suspension&quot; and &quot;trailing arms and a Watts linkage provide longitudinal and transverse location respectively&quot;. If you had a concordance and carte blanche to name every part what you wanted, you can make anything sound extremely technical. But a rose is still a rose and a straight axle is still a straight axle no matter how you mount it and how you name the connecting links and where they are connected to.

Again I am not saying this is junk by any means, but a very basic strut type front suspension and a straight axle/ coil spring rear with shock absorbers in not something you would want to use as a selling point, and apparently this is what Chrysler has decided not to do.

<b>A FEW MORE TIDBITS:</b>

There are a few different <i>&quot;suspension options&quot;</i> available like a <i>&quot;touring suspension&quot;</i> and a <i>&quot;luxury touring option&quot;</i>, but there is no real &quot;re-design&quot; of the suspension, just mostly different wheel and tire packages. You won't be getting any night and day differences in ride quality or boosts in cornering performance, mostly lower profile tires and a little wider wheel with more chrome and style.

So, would I turn down ownership of one of these sought after head turners based on the non-impressive suspension they sport ? No ! I don't know if I would chomp at the bit waiting on some months long list for the honor, but I would like to own one. Actually I would buy it and my lovely Wife would end up taking an &quot;extended road test&quot; with it.

Time will be a better touchstone of the workings of this vehicles suspension, but if things play out as I suspect, the initial fanfare will be as the Neon was, much hype, a die down from that, then a typical run of the mill vehicle that is not so impressive any more is what it will be remembered as.

Being based on the &quot;Neon platform&quot; is not such a bad thing, but with the excellent four wheel independant suspensions already available in the Chrysler stable, my opinion is they could have done much, much better than this. But again, there's 2002, 2003, etc...


If you are considering adding yourself to the waiting list for the P.T. Cruiser, you know now about what the suspension system will and will not offer you. Now is the time to read some reviews of the other aspects of this vehicle like interior ergonomics, seating, driving impressions etc. from the other members and advisors at epinions and decide for yourself if it will live up to the hype.
