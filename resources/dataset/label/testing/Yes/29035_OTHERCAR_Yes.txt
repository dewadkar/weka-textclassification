            Ruggedness combined with the seating capacity of a Sport Utility Vehicle brings the new Nissan SUT.  Currently, the only color available is yellow, but this concept &quot;truck?&quot; is sure to blow the roof off of the truck market.  The bed of the truck is considerably smaller than most truck beds, but the back of the cab opens up and the back seat folds down to create more room for hauling your goods.  The SUT has just been released, and should prove to be a market seller in the year 2000.<br><br>
