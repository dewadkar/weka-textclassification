            As I shopped for a weekend car, the X5 caught my eye from the start.  When it was first shown at the Detroit Auto Show in 1999, I knew that I would look at it when it came out.

The X5 seems to have it all.  A firm ride, off road capabilities, a great interior, great suspension, and of coarse with the BMW brand, a hefty price tag. What keeps this SUV running is a 4.4 leter V-8 engine with 282 horsepower.  It has many electronic/mechanical parts in the transmission which make this a unique BMW. The X5 comes with fulltime all wheel drive which helps its superb traction and breaking.  This gives the X5 both stability and offroad breaking power. 

For example: the vehicle is able to apply the brakes individually to each of the four wheels, and if neccessary, reduce engine power.  In the case of wheelspin, the X5 can direct more engine power to the other wheels while allowing the wheel involved to regain traction.

The BMW also features hill descent control (HDC) which is basically a downhill grade control system for steep slopes.  By engaging a button on the dash, the X5 will move downhill at a consistent and smooth speed at approximately 6 mph which it will maintain until the driver intentionally accelerates beyond that speed or applies the brakes.

The suspension setup on the X5 is very un-truck-like and lends further credence to BMW calling the vehicle a Sports Activity Vehicle.  Built as a unitized body, the X5 comes with a newly developed double-pivot strut-type front suspension with an antiroll bar and gas-pressure shock absorbers.

Inside, the X5 is an excellent place to spend quality time, offering a high level of comfort and equipment.  A few examples of interior quality include the activated carbon filter in the dual-temperature air conditioning, the multi-function steering wheel, two power sockets in the luggage compartment, the use of Montana Leather, and much more.

Optional extras on the X5 are numerous.  Among the options are double-pane insulating glass, a retractable cargo floor, a navigation system, park distance control, upgraded sound systems, a sports package, tire pressure control, wipers with rain sensor, and many more.

Over all, I didn't purchase the vehicle because I took a liking to the Lincoln Navigator, but this was my second choice.  If you are willing to spend the money, I suggest you look into this vehicle.<br><br>
