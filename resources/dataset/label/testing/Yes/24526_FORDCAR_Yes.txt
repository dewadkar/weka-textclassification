            The 2002 Ranger XL I have had for the last eight months has been an excellent first truck and an affordable, reasonable first new car.  As a recent college grad in my early twenties, I was pleased to find an affordable alternative to the dreaded lame, low-power, stuffy sedan (the Ranger rescued me from a Chevy Cavalier...shudder).  The positive aspects of this truck vastly outweigh its negative points; I enjoy the height, the surprisingly stable handling for a light truck, the excellent fuel economy, and the durable paint job that has thusfar withstood gravel, tree-branches and my moron ex-boyfriend scraping a parked car.  An added plus for me was the affordable custom security lid I had put on the vehicle which has given me such peace of mind when I have to leave the truck parked in the ghetto with all my camera equipment locked in the back, its like having a portable safe deposit box.  

On the downside, I took it to the same custom audio shop that did my old 1989 Honda Accord for a reasonable rate, and they came back with a seven-hundred dollar estimate on a simple CD changer, informing me that trucks are difficult to customize and that Rangers are particularly problematic.  So, the Ranger may not be a good choice for car audio-heads out there.  Also on the downside, I'm having an extremely difficult time handling the truck in the light snowfall we've gotten lately, but, to be fair, this could be due to the shoddy Firestones I haven't replaced yet.  I'm a little baffled as to why the Ranger XL, which has no towing package, is a rear wheel vehicle, I think the snow problem would be greatly reduced if the truck were front wheel drive.  

All in all, I think this was a great purchase, I'm very pleased with the vehicle overall and would recommend it for other young people trying to buy an affordable, functional new vehicle.

Anyone with any maintenance advice, etc. please email me.
