            For the past couple of weeks, I've been test driving many different types of cars.  When my dad suggested we go to the Hyundai dealership...I wasn't too thrilled.  I always thought they were pieces of junk, and they didn't consist of good quality.  Well, I ended up test-driving a 99 Accent, and I was very surprised.  

It drove very smooth, and for a 4-cylinder it had good acceleration.  The new models are very cute, and also much more affordable than most.  The warranty is uncanny.  The warranty covers the car for 10 years, or 100,000 miles.  I picked the color that I wanted (this kiwi color) and we sat down to talk numbers.  

The car I owned previously was a 94 Toyota Tercel, and the Accent's payments are still cheaper.  The car I picked had been a rental car, so it only had 16,000 miles on it.  It did not come with an ashtray...but that isn't a downfall toward the model of the car. I love my new little car, and I would suggest this car to anybody who doesn't have a big family...since it is only a compact car.<br><br>
