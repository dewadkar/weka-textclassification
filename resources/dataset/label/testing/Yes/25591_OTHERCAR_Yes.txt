            <B>Introduction</B>

I'm a real car guy, but my wife is not.  I like rear-wheel drive and manual transmissions.  My wife likes CD players and safety.  I would rather go fast, she would rather be comfortable.

She's always wanted a Saab and I've always dreaded it.  I've driven many, and they always seemed slow, rubbery, tippy, and just plain weird.  Why would I ever buy one?  Because she wanted it.

<B>Overview</B>

We bought our '99 Saab 9-3 in July from dealer stock.  We were considering the SE model (mainly for the power seats) but settled on a much less-expensive non-SE with leather and the sunroof.  We got ours for way under invoice.

Of course, my wife loves the car, but I have been really surprised at how much I like it, too.  It took quite a bit of getting used to, but now I actually like getting behind the wheel.

<B>Likes</B>

The Saab is quiet and smooth without being too isolated.  It has tasteful and thoughtful ergonomics without looking like a Honda inside.  It doesn't scream luxury by any means, but reassures you as the miles go by that it's more than just a GM hatchback.

The 9-3 can haul just about anything in the huge trunk, but more than 4 adults in the cabin will be tight.  The hatchback, folding seats, and removable cargo cover make the most of the car's size.  We have carried everything from furniture to mulch back there without a complaint.  However, the back seat is really a bit on the tight side for adult passengers.

<B>Thoughtful Touches</B>

* rear A/C vents in the doors and center console
* a change holder in the console
* child-seat clips built into the seatbelt fasteners
* split/fold/ski sack rear seat
* weather-band radio
* power outlet in the trunk

<B>Dislikes</B>

The Saab is a turbocharged car with an automatic transmission and drive-by-wire throttle.  These parts seem to constantly second-guess the driver.  You really have to outsmart the car to go fast. Stomp on the accelerator and the car takes off, but ease it down and you're smoked by all the SUVs on the road.  I leave the transmission in "sport" mode most of the time to get a little snappier shifts, but it's still tough to go fast in the car.

<B>Strange "features"</B>

* "Night Panel" is just too strange to imagine
* The A/C is a bit wimpy for Texas summers
* the above-mentioned child-seat clips are also included on the driver's seat!
* there's nowhere to put a CD case in the car except the glovebox
* CD player was optional in '99 and deletes the tape deck
* Advertised child seat tethers were missing and no one at our Saab dealer had ever heard of them!

<B>Overall</B>

The strange Swede has grown on me.  My wife says she'll always want a Saab, and I think I'll always agree, as long as I get something with rear-wheel drive and a manual transmission for myself.
