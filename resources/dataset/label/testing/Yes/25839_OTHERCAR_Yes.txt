            We recently rented a 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport while on vacation over Christmas. This particular Jeep only had 1900 miles on it so it was like getting a brand new one.
At first I really liked it. It's small enough to fit into compact car spaces, looks really sporty and has all the amenities. Because of the small size, fuel economy is rather good compared to many sport utility vehicles. We also managed to cram 8 suitcases and 2 boxes into the trunk area, although it meant totally blocking the rear-view mirror.
The engine is peppy, although not super powerful and it's rather fun to drive. 
After having the car a couple of days, though, my admiration started waning a little. My husband, son and I kept hitting our heads as we entered or exited the car. If it was just my husband, I would think it was a fluke, since he is over 6' tall. But when both  I (5'6&quot; tall) and my son (5'9&quot;) tall started doing the same thing, it was not a coincidence. The seats are also cut very narrow, so if you are not a skinny person, you're not going to be comfortable for long. 
I had occasion to ride in the back seat one time, and that was one time too many for me. It's very uncomfortable and leg room was practically non-existent.
I'm also disappointed that you have to use the locking clip in order to use a car seat with the lap and shoulder belts in the back. Although we kept our daughter in the center lap only belt for most of the trip, there was one occasion when we took our nephew with us, and thus needed to belt two carseats in the back seat. Well, at least the two little children had enough leg room.... 
I would not say it's a bad car overall, just not for us. I don't know the price of these cars new, but I believe they're on the lower end of the sport utility price range. Maybe if you're a young single person, this car would fit you well. Families are advised to skip it, in my opinion.
