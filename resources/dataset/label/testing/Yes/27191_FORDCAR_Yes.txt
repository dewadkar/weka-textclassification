            Ford's new Focus is a car that doesn't try to be
all things to all people. It's got lines that 
you either love or hate, and style that is
unique, if not truly ground-breaking. 

In my case, I liked the styling of the ZX3 model
enough to take one for a spin. The four-door
model initially seemed attractive, but I find
Ford's &quot;New Edge&quot; styling doesn't take as well
on that model as it does on the two door. A year
after its introduction, the four-door's styling
seems a little tired already.

Initial impressions
--------------------

The Focus I tested was painted in a very pleasant
gold colour, with a charcoal interior. The paint
was well-applied and very lustrous.

Exterior fit and finish was excellent.

Inside, the fit and finish was equally good. The 
styling, however, couldn't completely compensate
for a somewhat sombre tone that permeated the 
entire cabin.

The overall look and feel of the car, with its
relatively high roofline, was vaguely reminiscent 
of the new Toyota Echo. While you could never confuse
an Echo with a Focus, you could be forgiven for
wondering, in a classic 'chicken-or-egg' fashion,
which came first!


Driving impressions
--------------------

The Focus is very easy to get in and out of.
The one thing that struck me immediately
about the car(and left an indelible impression, 
I think!)was how comfortable the driving position was.

The driver's seat was comfortable without 
being sloppy, and supportive without 
feeling like a church pew. What was really
impressive was the seat's height adjustment, which lets
you tailor your driving position to your taste
in an almost infinite number of ways. 

I can well imagine lowering the seat for long, 
lazy highway drives, while raising it for in-town 
vehicular combat, where a commanding position is crucial.

The telescoping steering wheel is also a 
unique feature. It adds, in a synergistic way,
to the driver's ability to select a driving position 
that works for, rather than against him. In this
era of 'de-contented' cars, that's a 
very compelling reason to buy.

Ergonomics were generally good, with everything
close to hand and easy to find.

In town, the car handled well. Steering was 
precise, and offered good feedback. The substantial
tires that came with the car likely play a
significant role in how it feels on the road.

One minor drawback of the Focus is that
its roofline tapers quickly towards the back,
reducing rearward vision and demanding that 
care be taken when checking blind spots.

Braking was decent, and better than all of the
cars I've tried so far, save for the Mazda
Protege.

Ride was very good for a small car - in fact, 
it's probably the best of all the new cars I've 
tested so far. &quot;Smooth and supple&quot; are words that
come to mind when trying to describe the ride
quality.

With the exception of noise that is produced when 
the engine is pushed, the car is very quiet. The 
quietude speaks volumes, really, because it shows 
Ford engineers did their homework in the NVH 
(Noise, Vibration and Harshness) department. Sometimes
perception is everything, and in this area, less
is truly more.

Management of NVH, among other things,
is what separates great small cars from the merely
mediocre. Get those three issues right and you've 
got a car that can easily compete with the likes of
Mercedes and BMW.

The Focus ZX3 I drove came with a manual 5 speed
transmission. Shifting was a little vague and 
rubbery, but not sticky. Generally, the transmission
didn't seem to make very good use of the power
transmitted by the Zetec 2.0 litre engine. As a
result, low-end torque was lacking, forcing 
drivers to tromp on the gas more than necessary.

A brief blast down the highway showed me 
where the Focus really shines. In third gear,
torque is abundant, and cruising speed is
reached quickly. 

Amazingly, for a small car, it felt rock-solid 
at speeds above 80km/h (55MPH), with none of
the skittishness or jumpiness that plagues 
so many sub-compacts. I've been 
looking for a small car that also
doubles as a good highway hauler,
and I think I've found it in the 
Focus.


The Bottom Line
--------------------

The Ford Focus is a very good car. People who
find the latest offerings from Honda and 
Toyota a bit lacking would do well to look at a
Focus. It's certainly the equal of a Toyota
Corolla or a Honda Civic and in many respects
superior. It's miles ahead less esteemed
sub-compacts.

The ZX3 is probably best suited to 
single people carrying themselves and one
passenger. Family types would probably do 
better with the four-door or the wagon,
which is probably just as good-looking
as the ZX3.

Two things dissuaded me from buying a 
Focus. Namely, the lack of low-end torque, and
price. 

In Canada, a base Focus ZX3, with
the tilt steering/seat adjustment package
($700, and an essential item, as far as I'm concerned)
goes for about $17000.00. Add 15% for federal
and provincial sales taxes, and all the other
fees involved in buying a car, and you're up
to twenty bills in no time.

When I think of small cars, I think of the
word 'economy'. The Focus may be well built,
but economical it ain't.

A Focus may yet see its way into my driveway. 
I just have to find a way to come up with the
extra coin needed to show it the way home.
