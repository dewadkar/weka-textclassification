            This is my first family car. Had it for 6 months . Now approaching 40, I felt it was time to put the 2 door coupe's behind me and get something sensible - well not quite. ...

This car is simply the best saloon car on the road in my opinion. Superbly comfortable and well equipped. Simply stunning handling and performance. Yet refined and elegant.  Superb build - feels safe and solid. As capable of wafting you and the family away on holiday to far flung places as well as satisfying those more visceral desires to thrash down a country road. Even in traffic, its a nice place to be, with superb seats, climate control and music system.

Performance wise, it's the handling which satisfies most. The sheer grip of the 4 WD quattro is just superb. It feels like it has no limits (in the dry at least.)   If you feel like going for it, the tiptronic gearbox is best used as the automatic box  (despite having 300 programs in its Dynamic Shift Pattern memory) takes a bit of waking up. The 4.2 V8 growls when pushed and is all but silent when stroked around the lanes.

 You can lie awake at nights just thinking about it. Do I miss my old sports cars ? Not really.
Servicing costs and fuel bills are expensive. Fuel in the UK costs $9.65 a gallon at the moment !!! Watch out for front brake wear. There are 4 pads on the front and the discs wear or warp quickly. They are expensive to replace. Also the paintwork is strangely partial to scratches and chips. (You can lie awake at night thinking about that also....)

Something of a hidden secret these cars. They are far better than equivilent BMW or Mercedes and you just have the feeling you are in the best car on the road - if only others knew it. It is elegant without being brash or pretentious. Only you will know how good it really is.

Take your time to find a good one and inspect it carefully. Your reward will be driving heaven.....
