            The 91 Ford Thunderbird is an excellent value for a used car. Thunderbirds and Cougars from 1989 to 1997 were built using Ford's MN12 chassis, so much of this review applies to that common product line.

Whether you are an auto enthusiast on a budget or just a casual driver that wants something out of the ordinary - this may be the vehicle for you.

For starters, the T-bird is built with a Rear Wheel Drive, independent rear suspension chassis (RWD IRS). You don't have to be an auto engineer to appreciate this. Just drive around a few curves and realize the amount of control and confidence you can negotiate with this auto. The low center of gravity along with a solid, heavy automobile gives unparalleled command of the road, unlike SUVs and even some cars. The long wheel base and wide tracking add to the control. Despite its weight, suspension is tighter than cars in this weight range.

The front suspension, consisting of struts and rack and pinion steering, round out the handling picture.

The RWD IRS layout is often associated with cars costing thousands more, including Lexus, Mercedes and BMW, distinctive automakers that wouldn't do it any other way. Practically all inexpensive, run of the mill American and Foreign vehicles are front wheel drive.  While they do questionably add better handling in the snow, sandbags in the trunk and snow tires on the RWD vehicle will more than exceed the deficit. Some Tbirds even have Traction lok axles to make snowy roads more inviting.

Reliability on this car is excellent. It starts up every morning, the A/C works and the tranny shifts well. Many people would love to say this about their car. There is obviously some quality put into this vehicle, because the interior and seats look unbelievably new. Under the hood, you would not find a trace of oil or any other rouge fluid escaping a gasket. The paint and exterior is in excellent condition, sans a repainted rear bumper that I have to replace.

The styling on this car is unique but timeless. I'll describe it as attenuated sporty look but lacking the austere appearance of your average car that we are brainwashed to love. People have asked me if its new. Current sport coupes seem to have taken cues from this car. Most new sport coupes are smaller, though.

The T-bird can be considered almost a full sized vehicle. A large trunk, excellent front leg room, decent seats and room for 5 passengers compliment this vehicle. Despite its size it still retains vestiges of a true sports car. A new category of car -  Practical Sports Car "PSP" would descibe it.

I consider this vehicle above average in safety, and NTHSA real life statistics prove it. Air bags did not become standard until 1994.

My vehicle sports a 3.8L V6 pushrod engine. This may be the weakest link in this wonderful vehicle. Ford offered a V8, certainly a consideration if you are buying this vehicle used. While the V6 provides a decent off the line jump, high end power could be improved. The V6 in this vehicle is on par with low end v6 engines available today. Also, the V6 has aluminum heads and a steel block, which has produced a notorious head gasket fiasco for Ford. The problem is more pronounced with v6 engines from the mid rather than the early 90's. Despite this, I have seen these v6 engines pass 200K miles with no problems.

Another slight problem with this car involves some front end vibrations. This car has a propensity to warp the composite rotors due to its weight. The uneven rotor will shake the steering wheel a bit. Good quality rotors and tires are a must on this vehicle. 

The AOD transmission is decent, with perceptible shifts taking place as expected. This transmission is certainly on the sporty side, possibly to compliment the high torque v6 engine.  The seats are comfy and good for long drives. Controls are surprisingly ergonomic and resemble new vehicle layouts.

Gas mileage is respectable for a vehicle of this size with a v6, with about 19 in the city and and 26 on the road. Trunk room is more than adequate for this vehicle.

I bought this car for a very decent price, because I needed a car very quickly. I expected to trade it in for a new vehicle in a month. That was a year ago! 

It raised my standard for how an automobile should handle, and I am very reluctant to surrender it for a new cracker box sedan. I don't want to replace it with something new because there is nothing in my price range (~22K) that fits the bill. I may consider upgrading it to a later model V8.
