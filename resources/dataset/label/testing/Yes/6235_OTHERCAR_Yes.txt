            This past weekend, I went to check out a Nissan Frontier 2000 SE truck at downtown Honolulu on Nimitz Highway.I was able to test drive one. It was a platnium truck with all the trimmings you would want in a truck. It had side bars on both sides of the car, am/fm/cassette/cd stereo system, air condition, sunroof, utility racks on top of the roof, big/ wide space seats in the back, sliding glass window in the back, lots of room space in the front, 4 cup holders front and back of the truck, high off the ground, airbags in the front with a warning that &quot;airbags do not kill children but advise children to sit in the backseats with seatbelts a more safety approach&quot;, speakers surrounding the whole interior back and front,small bed, and a very POWERFUL V6 engine.I am purchasing myself a black exterior/ gray interior 2000 SE Nissan Frontier truck in 2-3 weeks.  Thank You for sharing my great excited news with you all.<br><br>
