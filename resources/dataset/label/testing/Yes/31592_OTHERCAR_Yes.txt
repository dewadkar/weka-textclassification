            i got my coolpix 800 when i moved two thousand miles from my mom (shes on the east im on the gulphcoast) being that i was very close to my mom i wanted a good, affordable digital camera so i could send pictures occasionally to keep my mom up to speed on my well-being etc. Well before i know it i was sending 5-10 pictures a day sometimes more! This camera is probably the easiest to use that ive seen around. Its affordable, compact and lightweight making for east transportation, storage and use. Im EXTREMELY happy with this product and urge you all to run and buy it!<br><br>
