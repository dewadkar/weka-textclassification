            I bought a 1999 F250 SUPER DUTY shortly after they were released in May of 1998. I am a farmer so I use this truck every day to tow heavy trailers: hauling cattle, equipment and so on. My truck is the XL series and it has the 7.3 Liter Powerstroke Diesel engine. It is equipped with a six speed manual transmission and Four Wheel Drive. The only mechanical defect that I have had on this truck was the parking brake lever broke in September of 1999. At that time, the truck had 63,000 miles on it.It is reasonably good on fuel mileage with my 20 f.t. stock trailer and 10 cows climbing mountains. I get around 11-13 MPG traveling  with no trailer or load 17-20 MPG. At this time, the truck has over 70,000 miles on it it still starts and runs like new. I also find the truck to be very comfortable to drive. 

Talk about power!  This is the first vehicle that I have owned that the cruise control works like it should. I would recommend this truck for anyone who has serious towing to do and wants to be the first one there. These trucks can tow.  I would not buy the diesel engine with a automatic transmission for towing purposes. The automatic transmissions are weak. They just do not seem to have the towing ability as the manual transmission. 

The Super Duty Ford Trucks are not for some one who doesn't tow much. I recommend buying a lighter model that is much cheaper. <br><br>
