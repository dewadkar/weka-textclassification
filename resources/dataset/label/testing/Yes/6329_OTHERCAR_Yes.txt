            I bought my Sienna as soon as I could get my hands on it.  I saw it in the New York auto show in March of 1997 and put off my minivan purchase more than six months (even though our second child was born during that time and we desperately needed a larger vehicle) until I could test the Sienna hoping it would be as good as all the hype.  We have not been disappointed.

We purchased the first issue 1998 XLE model with the luxury features available at the time:  leather, moonroof, upgraded stereo with cd, captains chairs, etc.  The van drives very well, has terrific pickup and a very smooth transmission.  Although not available at the time of my purchase, I would recommend the remote control door which is very convenient when carpooling.

You can easily flip one or both of the rear seats forward to enlarge the cargo area when you don't need them for passengers, or you can remove them without too much trouble for additional space.  The middle seats can also be removed if you have a large item (e.g. furniture) to carry.

Drawbacks:  not enough storage space in the front, and a small cargo area if you keep the rear seats in place.  The glovebox is very small and there is only one additional storage bin under the stereo (as contrasted with the ample storage in the Chrysler vans).  The rear cargo area can be less convenient than a regular car for packing grocery bags and other parcels, because there is not as much horizontal space.

Additionally, the handling is not quite as tight as I would have liked.  You can feel more sway during turns than in the Chrysler.  However, the overall feel to the Sienna is more solid.  Even now that my van is two years old, it runs smooth and quiet.  It definitely is a Toyota.

The van has required very little maintenance and we have been very satisfied with its reliability.  The only repair we have required was to correct an annoying creaking emanating from under the front dash; this was covered under the warranty, and I understand from the dealer it was a problem typical to the first generation of Siennas and has been corrected by Toyota.  It has not recurred in our van.

Overall, I have found the Sienna to perform up to my expectations and it has served my family of four well.  If you have a large family, you may consider the smaller rear cargo area to be a problem, if you are not able to flip one or both seats forward on big shopping trips or family vacations.
