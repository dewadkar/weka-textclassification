            Well, to start with, I didn't buy this car, I won it in a sweepstakes.

  I was shopping for a Ford Focus and on a lark I started putting in tokens to win it.  Best move I ever made.  I shopped for several cars (American Made was my only criteria) and had settled on a Focus but was not sure of which body style to choose.  After I won it I started shopping in ernest since I was allowed to pick all of the options and style.  What a tough decision!  This car is a dream.

  I have not had so much fun driving since my first car.  Then everything is new and different but after you drive a while, it becomes just a way to get around.  This car makes you feel like you are on top of the world. 

 I work for Ford Motor Company but my last new car purchase was a Chevrolet.  Now I know why this car has been picked as car of the year all over the world.  It handles like a dream and is so comfortable that when I get in and out of it, it is like sitting in my living room chair.

  I have a bad back and have had 2 surgeries in the last four years, so I know of what I speak.  I know that Ford has been advertising this car as a car for young teens and early twenties, but I feel that this car is for the boomers who are getting older.  I'm 47 years young and could not be happier with any other car since I have driven the Ford Focus.

The instrument panel is ergonomically designed so that everything is within reach and the gas mileage is great. (32 mpg around town)  I have talked several of the people that work for and with me into trying the Focus and so far everyone who has driven it has bought one either for themselves or a loved one.

 The only draw back I have found is that the ZTS that I have,did not offer a spoiler on it. (I remedied this by having Wayne assembly send me one and my husband put it on for me easily.)  The only other thing I found to complain about was that it came in so many great colors that I had a devil of a time deciding which one to get. (I picked Fort Knox Gold)

  Well there you have it.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  As a matter of fact, my husband just bought a year 2000 Lincoln Navigator and I told him I felt sorry for him because he didn't have a Ford Focus<br><br>
