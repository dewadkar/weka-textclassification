            AS a mechanic at Joseph Neri Chevrolet I see a lot of cars every day.
I love to test drive the new cars and test to see witch one I will buy 
next! The 1999/2000 Malibu is top of the list at this time with lots of room for the wife and kids and room to spare. The price is well worth the 
list of options you can get. I like the user friendly, easy to reach controls of this car make for easy driving. The smooth ride this car has
makes long drives more fun! This car has all sorts of the features that
you want and they come standard! The v-6 engine has more than enought power to make this car fast and fun! My next car will be the Malibu.<br><br>
