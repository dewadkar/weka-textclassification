            Remember the TV ad, &quot;Wouldn't you rather have a Buick?&quot;.  We have as we've had several Buicks over the years.  Models have changed, colors are different.  But the Buick is still a car with a smooth ride as was dad's 1955 Buick Special. Or Uncle Lute's specially ordered tri-color of black, beige, and red!

The 2000 Century--great looking car!  We bought ours in the color Light Sandrift Metallic in February, 2000.  It came with a good rebate package.  Current specials are available at www.buick.com, along with a gift certificate for test driving a Regal.  It ends June 30, 2000.  Check out other GM models at the site to see if any others are listed, might as well get a little something for your visit to the GM dealer.  Then drive the Century!

There are more economical cars re gas mileage, so check the stickers for info before choosing a car.  Century is a good car for those with children, but people transporting teenagers should let them try out the back seat for leg room.  

Century has features like dual temperature controls, child-proof door locks, an air-filtration system.  The keypad with openers for doors and the truck is really handy.  And I finally found out why the rear end seems to stick up in the air--it's called theatre seating.  So that the passengers in the back seat can see the road.  Sounds like a good deal for back seat drivers, huh?

Speaking of drivers, hubby calls this my car.  But when we go someplace together, guess who drives?

Tell 'em Dusty sent you.
