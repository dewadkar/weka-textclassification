            I have had 5 Hondas in my life, so you could say I am biased, but my 2000 EX Civic is still the best car I have ever owned. We had a baby in October of 99, and we needed a 4-dr vehicle, but I wanted something cool and not too expensive either. We went and test drove the Accord and the Civic and it came to this - we could have a so-so Accord with not much on it and a little more room, or get the loaded Civic. We went with the Civic obviously and have not regretted our decision at all. The engine has plenty of pep to merge with traffic, the stock stereo ain't bad as far as stock stereos go, it looks halfway cool, and the trunk space is very good - we recently hauled a pallet of stepping stones in it from Home Depot, no problem.

I really do enjoy owning this car. It is very fun to drive, and the comfort and roominess are more than what you would expect from a car this size. It is not going to make you think you are driving a Lincoln but it is still a pretty good ride. 

Some things I wish were different:

(1) Tiny gas tank - gets killer mpg, but I have to fill it up every 4-5 days.

(2) Cruise control not great - when you try to accelerate by pressing the button, it is as if you FLOORED the gas pedal instead of a gradual increase in speed. I usually just disengage and do it manually, then reset it.

(3) Sunroof buttons are not lit - I really dig my sunroof, but at night I have to fumble around to see where the buttons are. They should be illuminated like the dash and stereo.

(4) THIS JUST IN - the vinyl that covers the steering wheel is really thin and crappy. I think I have scratched it with my keys inadvertently a few times, but it is not even a year old and there are tiny but noticeable holes in the vinyl. And you do look at them the entire time you are driving.<br><br>
