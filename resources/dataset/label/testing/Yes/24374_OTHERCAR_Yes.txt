            Not too long ago, I was tired of never having a digital camera of my own and decided to go out and get one.  When I got to the store two things about the Sony DSC F55 made me abandon my plan to buy a Kodak: (1) the size of the Sony and (2) the great pictures (still and video) that I saw.  The next day when I took it too my son's soccer game and took some still pictures and video clips, I had all the other parents standing around asking what it was and how it worked.    

If size is important, the F55, thanks to the memory stick technology, fits the bill.  The camera is about the size of a WalkMan and probably weights about the same.  Into that small size, Sony has packed a 2.1 million pixel CCD and a host of features.  I particularly enjoy being about to take full motion video clips (stored as MPEG).  

The F55 uses a storage technology they call &quot;memory sticks&quot;.  
Some won't like the memory stick technology, but I the camera would be quite a bit larger if it used any other technology that I'm aware of, so I consider them a great feature.  The camera comes with a 4Mb stick which is sufficient for 15 or so 640x480 still pictures or 4 to 5 high resolution video clips (10 seconds each).  Sony sells a 32Mb version, so the capacity of the camera can be easily upgraded.  The biggest problem with the memory stick technology is that unless you by the PC Card adapter for the memory sticks, you're stuck uploading pictures over your computers serial line.  I've had constant problems with the serial link (I don't think its the camera's fault).  

The most serious drawback of the camera is the poor zoom.  Essentially, you have one zoom setting that is just a lower resolution version of the center of the screen (i.e. its done electronically, not in the lens).  Still, for my uses, I can do without a great zoom if the size is right.

In summary, I'm very happy with this camera and its garnered quite a few &quot;ohs&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; from people I've shown it to.  If size is important to you, then this might be the camera for you.<br><br>
