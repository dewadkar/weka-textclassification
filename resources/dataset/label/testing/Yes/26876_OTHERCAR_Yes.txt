            People in today�s society are faced with a tough decision when it comes to choosing an efficient, but aesthetically pleasing, family vehicle.  It used to be a choice between a mini-van, sedan, or luxury car.  Those few options became tired and people wanted more.  Then the SUV�s came into the market, and they just kept getting bigger and bigger.  Gas prices went up and the huge SUV�s guzzled gas like water on a hot day.  Smaller cars are definitely better on gas, but if you have a big family, a Neon just isn�t going to cut it.

Pickup trucks have never been considered a feasible mode of family transportation, but today the truck stands a chance in the �family car� section of the automobile market.  When <b>Dodge</b> introduced the <b>Quad Cab</b> pickups, the truck finally stood a chance, and to me, it offers a lot of options and advantages you won�t find with monstrous SUV�s or luxury family sedans.  

My girlfriend�s family just purchased a <b>Dodge Dakota Sport Quad Cab</b> pickup, and right away, I was amazed.  Not only is it a beautiful to look at (Cherry red with black trim and chrome wheels), it has a huge cab like a family car plus it has the stability and sturdiness of a pickup.  I climbed up into the cab and I felt like I was in a full sized car.  It was very comfortable and the interior was very nice.  I couldn�t believe I was sitting in a truck!

There is plenty of room in the cab for not only passengers, but also cargo.  You can fold the back passenger seats up and put groceries, luggage, whatever you choose there.  Plenty of room to spare.  On the bottom of the seats (revealed while folded up) you can find straps to put umbrellas or other small items you may have.  It all comes in very handy when you are pressed for space.

When you are carrying passengers in the back seats, there is always the truck bed to put your items on a trip.  With the optional bed cover, you can treat the bed like a huge trunk on a car.  Trust me if you need space for storage, you will always have it with the <b>Dakota Sport Quad Cab</b>.

Families also may need to haul a vehicle or trailer while on a weekend getaway or family vacation, and cars usually don�t have the muscle to accomplish such a task.  Again, a truck is ideal in this situation.  The Dakota I was talking about earlier has a V-8 engine that is ideal for pulling the boat me girlfriend�s family has.  They could never pull that off with a car, and it would be difficult with a mini-van.  So far, what I have seen of the Dakota Sport Quad Cab is nothing short of amazing.  I never would have expected it out of a truck.

If you are looking for a new car this summer season, don�t limit yourself to the same old standards.  Be daring and open up to the possibility that a pickup truck may fit your needs.  Give the <b>Dodge Dakota Sport Quad Cab</b> a test drive at your local dealership.  It is about affordable as your high end family cars and mini-vans, but it offers so much more.  I want you to realize the size of the cab and the limitless possibilities it offers as a family vehicle.  I have a good feeling that you will be as surprised as I was at how roomy, versatile, and overall fun this truck is.  I promise you that this truck will amaze you.
