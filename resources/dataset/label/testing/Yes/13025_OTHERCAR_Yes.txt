            What in heavens name am I doing driving a Volvo S80?  I own a Jeep!  Well, fact is my Jeep is awesome but I needed something a little classier.  The Volvo S80 was a gleam in my eye for quite a while.  With a price approaching the cost of my first house I resisted.

This is the car of your dreams.  My girlfriend was already a Volvo addict, I'd driven her Volvo 870 Wagon, I was impressed, but a Volvo Sedan was quite another matter.  I test drove a Volvo S80 while waiting for her Volvo to be serviced.  Service is something Volvo's infrequently need less oil changes and a wiper blade now and then.  The S80 is a totally different matter.

The Volvo S80 is a luxury car that blows the socks off even the best American Luxury vehicles.  The handling is flawless, quick and responsive.  The engine hums without straining in every situation I have encountered.  I'll reserve my opinion for handling in snow until this winter.  Regardless, if the S80 is true to character of the Volvo line I'll be overwhelmed with its intrinsic abilities.

My S80 cost just under $39,000 loaded.  Loaded means that I can not even think of an option the S80 needs.  Actually, there are more options than I will ever get use to using.  When you slip into the S80 the seats seem to conform to your body.  Leather, fully adjustable, total control.

Instruments are arranged in perfect harmony!  Everything is handy, everything is accessible and everything is easy to manipulate!  The four doors allow easy access to front and back, leg room is opulent and rear seat comfort equals that in the front.  The sound system is engulfing and perfectly balanced front and back.  A better combination of features is impossible to find!   

This car isn't for everyone.  But if you are looking for the ultimate luxury vehicle you will not find a better car!
