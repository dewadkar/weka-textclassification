            I bought my 1996 Explorer XLT because I thought it looked cool. There was no PRACTICAL reason for a single person to own such a mammoth, gas-guzzling, money-sucking piece of metal. Yet, I have loved every moment of ownership. Other than routine service, my SUV has had no unexpected costs. Although it did get a new transmission at 35,000 miles at a cost of $2100.00, fully covered by warranty.
I love the fact that it gives me a false sense of security while driving. i/e I sit up high.
I hate the fact that it now costs $35 for a tank of gas, as opposed to $17-18 a tank when I first bought it.
Families with lots of kids and junk to haul around should buy this car. As well as people whom own boats.
This is not a practical car for recent college graduates. It's too big and expensive to maintain. Get a nice Honda. Overall service is much cheaper with a reliable import. 
****Do NOT buy a used Explorer without an extended warranty. The out-of-pocket costs will eat you alive!****<br><br>
