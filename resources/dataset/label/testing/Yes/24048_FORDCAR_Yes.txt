            I actually went to the dealership looking for an Explorer until the Expedition caught our attention. The truck was for my wife to haul the kids around. At first, my wife thought it was too big and did not seem interested. I told her to go ahead and try it out anyway. As soon as she starting driving it, she was convinced it was what she wanted. It handled like a luxury car but was big enough to haul all of the kids and groceries. She feels the kids and her are safe in the truck. We have taken the truck on trips to Canada, throughout Texas and the southeast. The kids love the truck. It has lots of room. We have a third seat that is easily removed if we need to carry any furniture or heavy loads. We have helped friends and family move and it has been very convenient.
The price is unbeatable compared to other sports utility vehicles. We intend on buying another when we trade this one in. We would recommend this vehicle to anyone but especially if you have a family. We have enjoyed ours very much thus far.<br><br>
