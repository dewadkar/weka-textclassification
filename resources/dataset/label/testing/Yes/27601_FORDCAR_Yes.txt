            Having tried numerous 'high-end' suv vehicles, I took the Escape out for a quick try and was pleasantly impressed.   The transmission seems to be very smooth and the engine pulled strongly at all speeds.  A buddy tried one as well and said that it climbed up to a speed of 140 kph quickly, and was stable and handled well at higher speeds.  We both were driving the V6 XLT model.  I didn't notice any of the excessive wind noise that others have mentioned, and I presently drive a late-model BMW.

With an excellent price, good fuel economy and a comfortable and spacious interior, I think that the Escape will be very popular.  The Mach stereo is excellent, and I highly recommend purchasing it.  The power moonroof is also a great buy, and does a lot to brighten-up the interior.

After much contemplation, I purchased a dark green metallic XLT and am anxious to take delivery of it.  It seems to me to be the perfect compromise:  a vehicle which will be good in the snow, offers lots of space,  yet at the same time will not cost a fortune in gas.
