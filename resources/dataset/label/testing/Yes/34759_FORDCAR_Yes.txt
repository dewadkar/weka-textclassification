            Built on a Mazda Protoge platform, this is easily the best handling and most fun to drive compact car ever built by Ford. As someone who's owned several small cars in the last 5 years, this car is by far the best value on the market. To be sure, it's not in the same class as a Civic or Protoge, but for the $8900 I paid for a new 2001 it easily out performs the Neon, Mirage, Geo, Sephia, Nova and Sentra that I've either owned or test driven.

The power steering is a true one finger, but very tight. My steering has no unwanted play at all. It holds itself in turns extremely well. It handles rough roads with little pitching or swaying.

The interior is comfortable and has a much more room than a 1995 Escort I used to own. The stock stereo system sounds very good for an entry level car. The controls are logically placed and the ventilation is very good as well.

My gas milage is around 35 on the hwy and 28 in town, which for 130 hp is plenty good. Most other cars in this class have 90-110 hp and may get 1-2 mpg more if you like having to get out and push your car up steep hills. In the first 4 gears the pep is very good. I've left a few Neons standing still.

As to the cons, I have only 3 complaints. 1) Road noise. This seems to be a life long issue with smaller Ford cars. Even with the touring tires on my car there is too much road noise. It's a bit annoying that my car feels so good but sounds like a Geo Metro inside. It could be worse, but this is disappointing. 2) Tire size. Why I need 15" tires on a small car is beyond me. I see no real advantage and when replacing it's going to cost me an additional $50. 3) Although the first 4 gears are FUN to drive, 5th gear is a bit underpowered. I realize it's strictly gas milage gear, but it could be a little stronger.

My bottom line- I bought this car new in Portland, Oregon for only $8900. That's an absolute steal for this good of a car. Without question, this is easily the best car under $11,000 on the market. As this is the last year of production for the Z2X the prices will be very competetive. I say buy it.
