            We purchased a pre-owned 1996 Intrepid just a few days ago.  My car was totaled last week by a city dump truck (don't ask . . . although I will say that the accident wasn't even CLOSE to being my fault - and the city is being very, very nice to me. Also, thank heavens for seat belts!)  I thought I wanted a minivan, but we got an incredible deal on the Intrepid.  We took it to our mechanic, and checked the title history through the Internet.  Everything came out fine.

I love this car.  It's the largest passenger vehicle I've ever owned, and I'm finding I really like the room.  It's smooth, powerful, and quiet.  I'm a tall woman and I never realized how good it would feel to stretch out my legs toward the gas pedal.  The controls and instrument panel are well-designed and easy to manage.  Braking is easy and quick.  And the sound system isn't too shabby, either.

I do agree, however, with the opinion of a previous writer;  the position of the seat to the dash and window could have been done better.  The vertical visibility through the front windshield is minimal.  I don't personally like the feeling of a low windshield.  I would rather have a higher window with more vision upward.  This is the only complaint that I have, and it is a minor one at that.

I would recommend the '96 Intrepid to those who need a good-sized car with lots of leg room, and appreciate a comfortable level of ammenities.  This is an excellent &quot;family car&quot;.

I would NOT recommend this car to a young, immature driver.  This is a vehicle for grown-ups with grown-up sensibilities.<br><br>
