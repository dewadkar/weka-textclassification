            We have been using this camera for almost a year and we still absolutely love it.  The USB connection makes downloading pictures to the computer fast and easy.  It has a button right on the camera to start download.  It feels really light (it weighs less than 5 oz. with batteries installed), which makes it seem fragile, but between us and the kids it has survived some solid beatings.  We also like the fact that it doesn't eat batteries like most other digital cameras that we have used.  It uses power from the computer while it is plugged into the USB cable, instead of burning up the AAA's.  It has 4 different exposure modes for different lighting, and even takes pretty decent pictures in low light.  One of the best features of this camera is the small picture file size.  We upload our pictures to the internet to use on eBay, and it takes almost no time at all.  The software package that is included is great.  The Presto! Mr. Photo software allows integration with all of your photo software (we have at least 3 different programs).  Upon installation, this program finds all of your other photo programs and puts a shortcut to them on the index page.  This allows you to drag any photo into any program for editing.  We bought the camera at uBid (online auction site) for $80.00 after rebate. We feel like we stole it.
