            This camera has its ups and downs just like any other product i suppose.  First, the good points:  extremely portable.  It's a convenient size to bring along in a larger purse or backpack.  The picture quality is actually pretty good for being one of the lower priced cameras.  You can choose your the picture quality that you want.  If you pick the best picture quality you can store less pictures on the built in memory card, but you can get quality large size pictures without any distortion.  If you choose the lowest picture quality you can store a significant amount of pictures and still get pretty good quality on your pictures.  This is usually recommended for sharing on the Internet but i have also used this mode for prints and the quality has still been great.
The camera also features several other easy to use options such as different focus settings for portraits or landscapes, different shutter speeds for fast moving pictures, different color settings such as full color, sepia or black and white. 
I purchased the camera along with a printer at Staples for $200 plus tax and for that price i definitely got my money's worth.
Now for the cons: 
I have noticed a couple of times that if I am taking a lot of pictures in a row (more than 10 pictures or so within a couple of minutes) sometimes the camera will malfunction on a couple shots and give me a blank or distorted screen.  I attribute this to camera overload I suppose.
Another problem I had was an occasion in which i took pictures one day (Day One) and then additional pictures another day (Day Two) and when i unloaded the pictures onto my computer only the pictures from Day One were present.  All of Day Two's pictures had completely disappeared.  Very disappointing.
One other con is that there is a significant delay from the time you press the button to take a picture and when it's actually taken.  This can cause you to miss a spontaneous moment.
Overall though, i recommend this camera.  I bought it because I just gave birth to my son and I wanted to be able to take tons of pictures without having to pay to develop them all.  I believe I've gotten my money's worth.  Also, the software included with the camera is extremely easy to use.  When you unload the pics from your camera all you have to do is connect a simple plug from the computer to camera and it does the rest for you.
