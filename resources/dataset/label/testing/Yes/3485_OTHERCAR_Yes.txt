            I am sorry to admit it, but the Outback is not big enough for me!  We purchased this new in 2001 to replace my fabulous 1993 Honda Accord wagon.  I have a small horticultural business, and now a 7 month old child, and there is just not enough room in this car for my needs.  I thought I would NEVER go the minivan or large SUV route, but it seems I am headed in that direction.  
The reason we chose the Outback was primarily the all-wheel drive, and the comfort.  We test drove the Jetta wagon, the Rav 4, and the Honda CR-V, and the Outback outshone them all for comfort, handling and interior amenities.  It was an easy choice, but in hindsight, I would have been better off spending money on something a bit larger.  Mommies, consider your kid-factor carefully before buying this car.
Secondly, my husband is 6 ft. and cannot stretch his legs out in the front seat, or while driving.  His knees are right up against the dash, so when we hit the road these days, we take his Ford F150 so that he can drive comfortably for more than just an hour or so.  Also, I find now that trying to get the baby in and out of the carseat usually results in either her head or my head being bumped on the door jam.  I am only 5 ft 2 inches, and I just can't get in and out of it that easily.
The front seat area is quite small, but I find that this makes reaching things quite comfortable.  Radio, temperature, and glovebox are all within easy reach of the drivers seat.  Console is lit well, and readable at night.  I especially like the weather band feature on the radio.
Highway driving is smooth and relatively quiet.  I think the larger tires on the Outback make around-town driving a bit noisier, but it is not horrible by any means.  The handling is terrific, and both braking and turning are responsive and tight.  I am at 37,000 miles now, and am finally ready for brakes and tires.  I am pleased with that duration.
Overall, it is very cozy and well-appointed, and I love driving it.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't cut it for this small family anymore.
