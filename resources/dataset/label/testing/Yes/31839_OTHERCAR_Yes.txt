            The 2000 Honda Civic sedans are a significant improvement over the 90s generation. Style, room and performance have all been upgraded. The new Civic that I purchased has the next generation &quot;V-Tech&quot; engine. This little four cylinder is peppy, both in take off and acceleration. This really makes the Civic fun to drive, and not just economical transportation. The Honda Civic I drive averages 38 miles to the gallon in combined city and highway driving.

The Civic sedans have a large trunk with rear seat backs that fold down. This allows for transport of long items in the trunk, with the trunk closed. The dashboard and instrumentation is also well arranged for visibility and looks. The heater and radio controls are located within the driver's safe reach. The steering wheel height adjustment is still the same, and makes it difficult for large drivers or those with long legs to enter and exit the driver's side of the vehicle. This has always been my one, single negative about Honda cars. 

This car is an excellent choice for drivers on a budget and small families. Also, the Honda is for those who want a sports car ride, but, can't afford it.
