            I needed to buy a cheap car fast.  I planned to move 3000 miles, from New Brunswick to Florida, and figured I may as well buy a car as a plane ticket.  The Saturn dealership was my first stop and I fell in love with the first car they showed me in my price range.  It was a 96 SL1, 5 speed and the price was reasonable because the mileage was high (80,000km).

My only major problem with this car has been a hidden oil leak (discovered on the long trip).  Apparently, this was caused by the previous owner not doing preventative maintenance.  The company rebuilt the engine for me under the 6 month used car warranty.

My only complaint with the company is their high price for service.  Even diagnostic service is expensive.  As much as I want to follow their maintenance program, finances have me changing the oil myself.

I love this car.  I love its look, the way it drives and how safe I feel in it.  Definitely recommend it to anyone and I hope my next car is a Saturn.  P.S.  We're up over 150,000 kms now and still going strong. The car still looks new, oh, and the gas mileage is great, too!
