            Imagine a cool North Florida winter night,a two seater roadster, driving on a smooth two lane secluded road that stretches to meet the stars, the speed limit:65 With a flick of the wrist you down shift into a bend... and the engine stalls. After rolling to a stop,as you have done many times, you patiently wait a few minutes and make your first attempt at re-starting the engine. You reminisce about the past few years .....change over the electronic ignition....replace vacuum fuel pump with electronic........ rebuild carb........new fuse box....re-wiring

This was my typical roadster experience..... until we bought our new 91 Miata. Nine years and 74000 miles later we have replaced the clutch hydraulics($225) and sparkplug wires($50) and that's it.(except for a top or two)

 Myself at 6-1 or my wife at 5-1 have been known to drive all day long comfortably on one of our numerous driving vacations.The combination of the MGB driving experience and the Mazda quality and dependability makes the Miata a joy to drive.   <br><br>
