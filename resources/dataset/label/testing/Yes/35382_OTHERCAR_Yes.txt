            I am the second owner of a 1992 Subaru Legacy L 4wd station wagon.  The vehicle was purchased after the Acura Integra needed a new clutch.  The vehicle's primary purpose is to transport me from work and back.  It also serves as a secondary family car when the other is out of commission.  The family can all fit, if necessary.  Front seat room is good with the exception of head room.  Rear seat comfort is poor.  There is little head and legroom in the rear, the seat cushion is overstuffed too. Despite the poor rear seat there is plenty of cargo room behind the rear seat, but tall objects may not fit, because of a low ceiling.   
The vehicle does exactly what I want it to do, gets me to work and back.  I have had only 2 problems in the past 3 years.  First the water pump needed replacement, then all for brakes were needing to be replaced.    
The car handles well and acceleration is Ok. Steering is precise and tracking is dead on.  With the Full time 4wd activated the car handles securely in the snow. There is little wheel spin after an icy start.
Fuel economy is average for a compact car about 18-23.  There is enough power available  for highway passing and travel.  With the available  roof rack you can carry an additional 100 pounds.  The Roof rack is easy to access.  Lifting a canoe onto it is relatively easy.
