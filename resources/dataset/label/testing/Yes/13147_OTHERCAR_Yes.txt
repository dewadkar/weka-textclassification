            I also have, and owned the C-4040 and upgraded to this unit. Not so much for the 5 Megapixel (which is nice) but more for the options that this camer has. First of all it give EVERY function you can imagine that your very very expensive SLR will give, just w/o the price tag, and the ability to truly change lenses. Ok if you need to change your lens then this is NOT the camera for you anyway. But it serves every other purpose, and outperforms the competition hand down.

1. There are SEVERAL modes that you can shoot in, from Auto (where the camera sets everything) to Shutter or Aperture Priority. You can also set the f stops and much much more. Truly professional usage here!

2. The LCD is not quite as crisp as I would like it, but still MUCH MUCH better than the competitors.

3. The ability to use 3 diff types of media is GREAT if you find yourself in a bind and need to buy memory while away from home.

4. It is light, compact, and easy to navigate through the menus. Truly USER FRIENDLY while you are roaming through the many diff functions that it offers.

5. Offers diff Lens options, Black & White, Sepia, Erasure Board and more

6. White Balance is fantastic on the camera

7. Zoom is both FAST Quiet and VERY accurate. Digital Zoom is also accurate and easy to use.

8. Close ups are very clean even at 1" away!!!

9. Battery life is very very good when using 1800mah rechargeables. 1700mah are also very good. Figure on being able to shoot at least 250 pictures @ 1700mah with reviewing them, and about 350 @ 1800mah.

10. The software that comes with the camera (Camedia 4.0) is strong, and easy to use. Although the Red-Eye Fix is not the best on the program.

11. The ability to change the speed, and focal points on the flash are truly amazing.

12. The tilting LCD screen is also a very nice added touch.

With the quality of the pictures even when being blown up are now better than real film, I actually see no reason to keep my Canon set up. This camera is truly a keeper, and one that will pass the tests of time. Olympus may have a hard time actually beating this camera. I cant imagine what they will do to improve on it? Maybe 6 or more megapixels???
