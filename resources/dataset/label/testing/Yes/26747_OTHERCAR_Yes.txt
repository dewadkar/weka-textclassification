            I recently got the Olympus D-360L digital camera and have had a blast taking lots of pictures.  Just the fact that I can see in an instant what I just took a picture of is amazing to me - even better when it's on my computer screen!  I've seen some cheap stuff out there and this is definitely a better choice.
I can easily download images on my computer and send them via e-mail which keeps my parents updated on their grandson.  I can delete pictures that I just took and don't want and can continue shooting till I get it right (that's the perfectionist in me!).  I have stood very close to someone or something to get a great quality close-up without the blur.  One of the features allows you to zoom 2x, but it's minimal.  There is a small 1.8&quot; lcd screen on the back of the camera to view the pictures (the more you use it, the faster you'll go through batteries).  The quality of your computer screen will show far better resolution than the camera (to be expected).  
Some pictures have been washed out by the flash (because it's too bright) so I have the option of turning it off.  Occasionally I have needed to place something in front of the flash to filter it, but that is the worst I've experienced thus far.
Right now I have a 4MB SmartMedia card in my camera which allows me to take 36 pictures.  The higher you go the more you spend, but this is suiting me just fine.
There are some far better cameras out on the market, but the Olympus serves my needs at this time and I am very satisfied.  I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg, nor did I want bargain basement quality.  I'm not a computer guru and still don't know a lot of terms, but if someone wants quality and a good name then this is the camera to consider.  <br><br>
