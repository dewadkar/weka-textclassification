            I am extremely happy with my Saturn.  I have not had any major problems with the car.  The Saturn dealers are all extremely helpful when I take my car in for service (the really do the ceremony like in the commercials when you buy the car).

My car was very affordable and was definitely worth the money.  They are especially nice for new drivers because they are not very expensive and they are very safe.

I have had a few problems with rattles here and there.  However, they were covered under the warrantee and they were fixed right away.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the car.<br><br>
