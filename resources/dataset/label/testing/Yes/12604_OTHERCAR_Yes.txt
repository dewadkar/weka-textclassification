            The Canon PowerShot S10 is a great little camera.  I just got it last week.  I had shopped around for sometime trying to decide which camera to buy.  After long and hard research I decided on the Canon PowerShot S10.  For the money it has the best feature.  It has a 2X zoom lenses and 4X digital lenses.  You can get some pretty good close up shots.  Yes there are buttons and commands, but they are easy to figure out with the owners manual.  I enjoy taking pictures and deciding weather I like them or not.  If not I don't have to waist the time or money on processing them.  It can viewed on the computer or TV with a video jack.  It is fun to see them in large size.  The kids like seeing themselves on TV and in such a large and clear size.  The camera came with some great software.  It is Adobe amd Zoom IT.  Both are easy to use and install.With the Zoom It program you can down load or delete pictures on the camera, instead of going through the camera's menu.  That is easy to do.  
I shopped around.  This camera's price ranged from $399.00 to $546.99.  I was able to get it at Staples, and had a coupon to bring the price down to $375.00.
The battery life is short if you use the view finder.  I would recommend the battery pack.  It was ranges from $89.00 to $99.00.  I was able to pick it up for $89.00 at Staple and had a coupon for $10.00 bring the price down to $79.00.
I would recommend this camera to anyone that like to take pictures.  It is light weight, easy to use and carry.  It would make a great gift for a loved one or yourself!<br><br>
