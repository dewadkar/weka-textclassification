            I bought the Nikon CP 950 last week, and have not been disappointed in the least by its performance. I specifically chose the 950 because it's one of the few consumer-level digital cameras that offers manual controls (the only others I know of are the Fuji MX-2900, the Olympus 2000Z, and the Epson 850Z). Specifically, the 950 offers you aperture priority (you choose the aperture, it chooses the correct shutter speed), shutter priority (you choose the shutter speed, it chooses the correct aperture), manual focus, and aperture bracketing.

These manual features afford you tremendous possibilities for creativity. With shutter priority, you can capture motion blur (for example, make freeways look like rivers of red and white light). With aperture priority, you can define the proper depth of field for a subject (for example, slightly blur the bustling Paris street while keeping your beautiful, espresso-sipping companion in crisp focus).

(Check out:

if you would like to see some examples of the shutter priority in action.)

You'll get these manual controls, plus you'll get amazing resolution (1600 X 1200 pixels), fantastic metering options (matrix, spot, or center-weighted), easy-to-use fully automatic controls, etc. In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

You will, however, pay a premium for this camera (I paid $850). And if your from the old school of photography, this camera will take some getting used to. You won't like, for example, that the lens defaults to full zoom everytime the powersave kicks in. You won't like that there is no attachment for a cable release (the workaround is using the self-timer). You won't like its voracious appetite for batteries.

But if you give it some time, I think you'll be impressed with the results that you can achieve. Finally, this is a digital camera that is capable of delivering more than just snapshots. If you're good, this camera can take you into the realm of fine art.

*A Note on Purchasing*

Here in LA I found no traditional retailers that could come anywhere near beating the online prices. Their cheapest price was a full $100 more expensive than what I ended up paying online. That said, do exercise caution when buying online. If you use a price search engine like mysimon.com, don't necessarily get sucked into the site offering the lowest list price. You may find as you try to complete the transaction that the price is just a teaser and that they really nail you with inflated shipping charges, oppressive return policies (I shouldn't have to pay a restocking fee of %10 to %15 if there is a problem with the camera), or multi-state sales tax. In the end, I went with Amazon. Perhaps I paid $30 or $40 more than the competitors, but I got peace of mind, great service, and fair return policies in return.  <br><br>
