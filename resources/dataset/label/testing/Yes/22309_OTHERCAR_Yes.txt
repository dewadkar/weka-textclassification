            MAZDA hit the jackpot with it's MPV 2000 van. All the best features and then some in a easy to handle package. Third seat folds into the floor with ease. Power windows in the sliding doors! Bet all vans will have them soon. Second row seats move sideways to separate into two bucket seats or together to allow easier entry to the rear seat. Plenty of cup holders and storage. Van is no longer than my wife's Toyota Camry and fits in the garage with room to spare. Visibility is great. Looks like a M------- from the front. Could use a larger engine as an option. Seats are comfortable and give great support. Side airbags are an option which was already installed but should be standard on all vans. Traded in my MAZDA Millenia for this van with few regrets. Quality and workmanship still exist. Take a test drive and compare to other brands. If money is no object you can buy a van for many thousands more but you won't get a better vehicle dollar for dollar.<br><br>
