            I decided on Maxima SE in August 2000 after a lot of shopping around.  Just one year ago I purchased a 2000 Nissan Altima SE w/auto.  In retrospect I know I really wanted the Maxima, but I rationalized not paying the higher sticker.  Anyway, one year later I am wiser and far more pleased.  This car delivers everything that the catchy advertising promises.  The Maxima delivers more power and 'performance' than any car in its class and even some 'above' its class.  I really enjoy the 5spd even though I live in the city.  The CD stereo system sounds great especially when I am cruising along at 75mph.  The interior design is great and the ergonomics make sense.  The steering wheel controls for the stereo would have been great on the 2000 model, though.  The gas mileage is respectable considering what you're getting from this award winning 3.0L V6.  I am extremely pleased, but there are a few points of concern.  The headliner material in the car is a bit on the cheap side.  The trunk is very spacious, unfortunately the trunk hinges are flimsy, cut into the cargo space, and really shouldn't be on this quality of a car.  Finally, the paint looks great; though, recently I noticed that the paint chips very easily with exposure to normal driving conditions.  Again, no matter what the age, if you or your family is into a spacious performance sedan that won't break the bank, then the Nissan Maxima SE deserves serious consideration.<br><br>
