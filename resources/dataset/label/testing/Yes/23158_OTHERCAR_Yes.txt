            I've always thought Cabrios were cute, but it wasn't until recently that it occurred to me I might be able to afford one. A recent college grad, I have finally graduated from being poor and broke into comfortably paid. Though they were pricier than I would've liked, I thought that this might be my last chance to buy a cute fun car for the next 25 years if and when I have kids, so I thought what the heck.

I have to say that this little car can take a beating. I didn't know how to drive a manual transmission when I bought it, but the car takes my screw-ups like a champ. It has more pep than I would've expected and is very forgiving with my inability to drive it as well as a seasoned stick-driver. 

Though I haven't had much experience with driving it as a convertible because of crappy weather, it is really easy to put the top up and down. I am very petite and thought I might have some problems with it, but it's not difficult at all.

I didn't think I'd mind the tiny truck space, but I kind of do. I do SOME traveling on weekends to see my family back home, and when I do, I hardly pack anything. But the miniature-sized back seat and a big boot in the truck leave for little packing room. I'll deal with it because I love the car, but it's NOT good for anybody who has a lot of luggage, so to speak. 

The seats could be easier to adjust, or have more positions in which the seat can be locked. Like I mentioned, I'm very short so that poses a problem in that I cannot completely depress the clutch without having my right leg at a 90-degree angle to use the gas. I like to recline when I drive, but I can't do that in this car so that's slightly annoying, but I deal with it. The seats are nice and hard though, which provides good back support. 

I haven't had any maintenance, mechanical, electrical or other problems since I had it, so I cannot comment on the ease of ordering parts, etc., but the VW dealership says they will provide me with a loaner and if it needs to be in the shop, and since I bought it 30 miles away because of their good reputation and the bad rep of my local dealer, the Gen. Manager will meet me halfway with the loaner car and take mine in on my behalf to save me a trip. We'll see if that holds up or not....

Overall, I love my cute little car! It's the Desert Wind color, but I just tell everybody that it's silver, and I absolutely have NO regrets about buying it as my first car.
