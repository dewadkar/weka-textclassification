            <b>I've had this camera for quite some time now (1.3 years), and was shocked to find that just within the past month I've taken 500 pictures.</b> Now, hold on! Are you saying that in about 25 days I have depressed that little button on top for 500 times? That made me think of this camera's long life. I must have taken about 4000 pictures with this thing!

<b>MY STORY</b>
I got this at CompUSA about 1.3 years ago, for $129.99, I believe. I was looking for a house then, and I wanted a Digital Camera so I could take pictures of all the houses I�d seen and liked. I also got a 32MB Compact Flash Card for $40 (CompUSA Cheapie). I didn�t really care about the MegaPixels, because I�m not a professional or anything. I just wanted something to get the job done. I just wanted the most features for the small price tag. I decided on $150 as my price limit. One day I came across this in the CompUSA sale paper. It was $129.99 after rebate. I read on. 1.3 Megapixels, 2X Digital Zoom, 1.8� LCD, and Auto Everything (with focus, flash & self-timer overrides). And, as if the two went together, there was a 32MB CF card right next to it, and I mean RIGHT next to it. I said, �It�s a deal!� and came home with the box.

<b>PROS</b>
1.3 Megapixel
2X Digital Zoom
LCD Screen
Easy Operation
1200x1600 Max resolution
3 Quality settings

<b>CONS </b>
2X Digital Zoom
LCD Screen

<b>WHAT I LIKE</b>
There are plenty of good things about this product that I like. First of all, the LCD Screen. Every digital camera must have this! If it doesn�t have the screen, don�t even consider it. If you use the analog viewfinder, your shot is off-centered. You need one to get the correct placement, and besides, you couldn�t review your pictures without it. And the image quality. The quality of this camera is absolutely suitable for framing, provided you have it on the fine setting, or even better, the super-fine setting. The build quality is very solid and I think it might take more that me dropping it to break it. It�s very solid and it doesn�t have that �plast-icky� feel that some cheaply made things have. The digital zoom is a nice feature, but is not suitable for framing. For some stupid reason, you can only take zoomed pictures on basic setting, or 640x480 resolution, regardless of the setting YOU choose. And when it comes to easy, this thing is easier to use that a microwave, or a dishwasher, or even a sink for that matter. There a 4 controls: Power, LCD Screen on/off, Shutter button, and a multi-function wheel. To take a photo right out of the box:
1.	Install Memory card.
2.	Install included Energizer e2 batteries.
3.	Turn power switch to Camera mode.
4.	Set time and day with wheel.
5.	Aim camera at subject, and press shutter.

All done! To review pictures:

1.	Turn power switch to Playback.
2.	Use wheel to scroll through pictures.

There! That�s it!

<b>WHAT I DON�T LIKE</b>
Okay, only a few things. First, the LCD screen frame rate. In low-med light, the LCD screen refreshes really slow and it�s not even worth using in this case, so just use the optical viewfinder. And the zoom really takes away from quality, so you could just take the photo normal and zoom in on the computer. And then, the quality isn�t perfect. That�s all!

<b>MENU OPTIONS</b>
You have 2 different menus: one for playback mode and one for camera mode. In camera mode, your options are: Quality, Flash, Focus, Self-Timer, Zoom, and Set-up. Under quality, you choose Basic, Fine, or Super-Fine. I use Fine because there is not a distinguishable difference between Fine and Super-Fine, and they are the same resolution. Plus, you get 2x the picture amount. Under Flash, you have Auto Flash, Auto Flash with Red Eye Reduction, Fill Flash, and No Flash. Under Focus, there�s auto and macro (for close-ups). There is an On/Off for Self Timer as well as Digital Zoom. And setup is where you set time & day, reformat CF and do some other mumbo-jumbo. The playback menu has: Delete, Lock, Zoom, View as Thumbnails, and Setup. Under Delete, you can delete the current photo or all the photos. Under Lock, you can lock the current or all photos. This prevents them from being deleted. Zoom uses the wheel to move up and down, then if you click it twice, you go side to side. The View as Thumbnails is handy. It displays a bunch of pictures on one page so you can find the right one. And the setup menu is the same as on Camera mode.

<b>ALSO</b>
The guys at HP don�t recommend using rechargeable batteries. In fact, they say that damage �may� occur to the camera if you do. Having seen about 50 people use rechargeables in this camera, I bought 8 NIMH 1600MAH batteries and a charger. You can get a set for about $30. Not only will you save $100�s if you do, but the life is longer. You can get triple the pictures in 1 charge. I have 2 sets because if 1 dies the other is ready. My batteries are STARTING to lose their long, long life, but whaddaya expect?
