            Just bought this camera, and have been playing around with it quite a bit.  I was going to buy it online, and so I went to the local Fry's to have a look first to be sure it was what I wanted (I later ended up buying it at Costco, which had it for the same price that I could buy it for online, plus shipping).  My first reaction upon seeing it was, "Wow, it's tiny!".  And it is, compared to most of the other Olympus cameras.  Still bigger than some of the small Canon ones, but the D-40 is small enough to slip into your pocket.  The only issues I have with the size are 1) it is on the thick side, relative to the other dimensions, which limits how pocketable it is, and 2) the smaller they are, the harder to hold.  I don't have any problems myself, and I have big hands, but I suspect some people would feel uncomfortable.

What I really like about it is the fact that it is a premium quality camera, with good optics and an excellent feature set, packaged in a point-and-shoot rugged design that means I won't necessarily have to purchase a case for it and hang it around my neck.  That's important to me, because most of the shots I take are short-notice opportunity shots, and time is usually of the essence.

One thing I found kind of cheesy is the noises it makes when you turn it off and on.  Kind of like Windows startup and shutdown sounds... over a tinny little speaker.  I could do without that.

All in all, I'm very happy, and I have no regrets whatsoever about buying this bad boy.  I'm upgrading from a 1.3MP Olympus D-360L, so this is a very nice change.  Given the choice, I think I would have been just as happy with a 3 megapixel version of this camera, but I'm not going to complain about an extra million pixels :-).
