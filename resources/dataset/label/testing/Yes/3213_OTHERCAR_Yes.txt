            The Sony DSC-S85 is a 4.1 Megapixel camera, which is in the higher end of digitals.  The picture quality is close to film, and printing on a photo printer or at a retail store provides acceptable results.  The lens is by Carl Ziess, with no flaws or distortion.  

There are several nice features, including a black & white mode, the ability to record mpeg movies with sound (length depends on the memory stick), 6x digital zoom, and the ability to set the image quality (density) of your pictures.

The Cyber-shot is packages with a full set of cables for pc connection, however I've found that an external memory stick reader allows speedier image viewing and transferring.

On the Cons side, you don't have a middle ground when predetermining image quality - the two choices are high and low, limiting you to a lot of okay photos or a small number of high quality ones.  

Another con, is the navigation button on the back of the camera.  This 'rocker' style button is small, and my large fingers have some difficulty accurately navigating the menus (my wife doesn't have this issue).  

I hope this review is useful, and I would be delighted to hear your opinions.
