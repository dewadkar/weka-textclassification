            Three years ago, after seeing the dramatic outcomes from small car accidents, we decided it was time for something Bigger and SAFER. Our choice: the Chevy Astro Van. In our efforts to be thrifty, we purchased a used Van. A 1986 model to be exact. My thoughts at the time were that we'd get our immediate use out of it and put it to rest when a better thing came along. Well, today I dropped off our kids from school, drove around town running errands, and picked up the kids again in THAT very Astro! During my round-abouts today, I was hit by another car. After seeing the damage to the other vehicle, I was pleased to see that minimal damage had been done to mine. Best off all,(no one was hurt)we were SAFE in our big van! The proof is in the pudding: Bigger is better for us! 
I can't imagine not having it, with it's great capacity for our family's needs. Groceries, violin case, baseball and softball equiptment, back packs and family dog...all have plenty of room in my Chevy Astro! When the time comes to replace my old buddy, it will be with another Astro.  <br><br>
