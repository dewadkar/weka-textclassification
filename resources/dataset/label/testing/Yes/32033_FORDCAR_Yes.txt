            I bought my Ford Explorer the winter of 98, it's a '96 Ford Explorer, V6, 4WD.  I've had no problems with it, it's never been to the shop.  I bought for a college vehicle.  I'm a freshman in college, so therefore I know that I drive it a little rough.  My friends say that I beat the hell out of it!  But I love it, it always runs perfectly, it has just the right amount of power. Not too much, but not too little either.

This vehicle drives just like a car.  It glides over bumps, and when I pull out to pass a vehicle, it gets up and goes.  I consider it a safety option.  A vehicle should have enough power to pass cars in a certain amount of time.  Which my explorer definently does.

I recommend everyone should own one of these.  It is just really fun to drive.  Well, you shouldn't drive this vehicle if you are afraid of safety and luxury.  It's perfect in my mind.<br><br>
