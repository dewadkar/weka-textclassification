            I bought a 1999 Pontiac Trans Am Firehawk about a year ago.  It currently has about 10,000 miles, and I have never had a problem.  It is a beautiful, powerful, driving machine.

So what is a Firehawk vs. a Firebird?  Let me tell you.  A top of the line Firebird, is a Trans Am.  There is also a mid-level version called the Formula.  Well, Pontiac takes a limited number of Trans Ams and Formulas and ships them to Canada (SLP Engineering) for modifications.  In 1999, somewhere around 600 Firebirds were converted to Firehawks.  Mine happens to be number 14.  Anyhow, at SLP, the base Pontiac automobile has a new hood added, which includes a functional air scoop.  This boosts the horsepower about another 20, to 327.  Add racing suspension which lowers the car 4-5 inches.  Then a stainless exhaust system.  Chrome wheels and new low profile Firehawk tires.  And finally a new sportier spoiler.

So what do you have when Pontiac and SLP are through with your new car?  You have a fast, growling, numbered limited-edition, street car that can go 90 in second gear.

OK.  Now the nitty gritty.  This car sticks to the roads quite well.  I drive over a mountain every day, and this car loves the twisties.  Acceleration is...  unbelievable.  Even without speeding, going from 0-45 at the light, outpacing a motorcycle, is a thrill.  Highway driving is easy.  I can jump from 55 to 80 without changing gears while in 4th.  No problem.  Did I mention it is a six speed?  Fuel consumption sucks.  I am somewhat an aggressive driver, but I do not cruise much over the highway limits.  My driving yields about 14 miles per gallon.

Hope this helps.  I am sure if you buy a Firehawk, you won't be disappointed...
