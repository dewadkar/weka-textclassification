            After 30 years of having to work for everything I own, my father bought this truck for me.  He does very extensive researching before he buys anything, so I trusted his judgement.

I love this vehicle because it can be used for every day driving, but has room for road trips with friends, or camping gear, all my sports equipment, and moving furniture (but not too much).  It's comfortable, and it has great heating and air conditioning.

There are only 3 things I dislike about this vehicle.  It has an extremely short turning ratio, it had a blind spot on the right, and there is no convenient place to put a drink or a cup of coffee.  I've gone through 3 headlights though, and the speedometer seems to have a short in it.  The headlight thing is a problem, but I think the short in the speedometer could be fixed by a friend that knows a little about wiring.  I'm also not sure that has anything to do with the manufacturer though.  Could be that the last driver had something to do with that.

It is the best vehicle I've ever had for taking long trips.  It is comfortable, runs smooth, starts every time, doesn't get too hot, never uses oil, and never breaks down.  I am totally confident when I start out, that I will make it to my destination.

I would recommend this vehicle to people who are active, travel to Tahoe a couple of times a year (or wherever snow is in your area), or just like to carry around a lot of stuff for those &quot;just in case&quot; days.  If you don't travel in the snow or off-road a lot, you would be better off with a vehicle that doesn't have 4-wheel drive.  It's pretty good for a family of 4 or 5.<br><br>
