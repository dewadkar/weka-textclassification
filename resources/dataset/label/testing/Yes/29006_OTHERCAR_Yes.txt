              We purchased our HONDA C-RV Special Edition several months ago and made a road trip across the South and into the mountains of northern Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina.  Our C-RV came equipped with ABS braking system and 4-wheel drive which served us well on wet mountain roads and in off road conditions in the National Forests and wilderness areas. 

  It has great pickup and acceleration.  It gets great mileage with about 20 mpg in the city and 26  mpg on the road. It provides super handling and we had no problems in all kinds of driving conditions including some that were very hazardous. The all wheel drive automatically kicks in when you need that extra traction in rocky or slippery terrain.  It does the thinking for you! 

  Visibility is great and the ride is smooth  and comfortable. The seats are extremely comfortable as well and the well designed interior places everything within reach.  The CD player, cassette player and radio have excellent sound  quality.  The Special Edition has power locks,windows, side view mirrors and  a beautiful color keyed spare tire cover mounted on the rear tailgate.  That tailgate operates flawlessly providing easy access to the cargo area.  There are convenient power outlets in the cargo area as well as in the dash making it easy to power up or charge your cell phones, appliances and personal accessories. 

  The Special Edition comes in select colors and we chose the metallic gold with the charcoal leather interior.  It is a great looking vehicle and we get loads of compliments on it everywhere we go. Since we already own a Honda Civic 4 door Sedan we were expecting that excellent HONDA quality  and we sure weren't disappointed.  
  
  My husband is ready to trade that sedan  for another  HONDA C-RV so we both can drive one all the time.  We won't hesitate to invest in another C-RV because it is really enjoyable to drive and very convenient to load and unload groceries and supplies.  It held loads of luggage and is great for hauling everything. We even were able to haul a huge Big Man's Recliner in the cargo area.  

  We love it!  We have had no problems at all and with HONDA quality, we don't expect any. I just want my husband to hurry up and buy that second one so he quits borrowing mine!  You'll love it too!<br><br>
