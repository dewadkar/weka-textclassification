            In short, my Kodak DC265 is the best camera I've ever owned. I've had this camera since the Spring of 99, and soon after sold my old camera at a garage sale! This camera can do anything that one could do...only better! A digital camera has many benefits over a traditional film camera, including:

1. I can store my pictures on my computer (or CD's or a Zip drive)
2. My pictures are easily emailed to friends and family
3. I don't have to have a &quot;picture disk&quot; processed with my film in order to put pictures into greeting cards, newsletters, etc.
4. Only the shots I want are printed

I like my Kodak camera for several reasons. The resolution on this camera is high enough that I can print near flawless 5x7 prints. I have several in picture frames that cannot be distinguished from an actual photo without a magnifying lens! I like being able to review images on the camera, and deleting them on the spot if they don't meet my expectations. There is also a &quot;wow&quot; factor with a digital camera. This model comes with a video cable, allowing me to put on a slide show for guests at a party, right on my television. I can also do this on the computer, and have custom printed pictures for family this way.

Don't be put off by the $999 retail cost of the camera! You can easily beat that price...$718.95 on buy.com, for example. The camera uses a great set of rechargeable batteries, an extra set will ensure that you never run out of power. This was somewhat complicated to learn how to fully use, but allows for adjustment of white balance, light, resolution and other settings. The camera uses a digita operation system to function, and accepts periodic upgrades to the software. I've even got a jigsaw puzzle program installed right on the camera, which allows me to take a picture and turn it into a jigsaw puzzle that can be solved on the camera's lcd screen. A little taxing on the batteries...but can fill a few dull moments. The only way you'll get this one out of my hands...it with the NEXT Kodak digital!<br><br>
