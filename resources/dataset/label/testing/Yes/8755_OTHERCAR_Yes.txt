            I have tried out most of the three megs on the market today and have to ell you I settled on the PDR-M70. Here's why: It's the image, stupid!.  This camera takes awesome pictures that l ook just like film, plus gives you all the advantages of digital imaging. Moreover, it has this VERY COOL  video feature WITH SOUND that you can play back or use as e-mail. Blows away Sony, Epson and that rest. I love this camera. If the price is too much for you, look at the M5 from Toshiba. I have one of those too. Love it, but the M70 is a big step up  in imaging quality. If you love their laptops, you will love Toshiba cameras. I bought it from Best Buy (who had a very well-informed sales person at the desk). Only thing I didn't like was the lack of a lens cap, which is a problem because I travel a lot. Other than that (which is minor) I LOVE THE  PDR-M70)!!!<br><br>
