            Well,  we finally broke down and traded in the Trooper for a larger vehicle. 
After weeks of searching and test driving many minivans we finally came up on a Astro van. We loved it but didn't end up getting it because it had way to many miles on it. So our dealer said he would look out for one for us. Well he called us about 2 weeks later and said he had a beautiful 1998 Safari in and we could come and look at it.
I was a bit skeptical because I was getting sick of &quot;looking&quot; and not being satisfied. We went down and I automatically loved it...much better than the Astro. The Safari was all power, had cup holders and tray holders thru-out it for food and drinks. It is AWD (All wheel drive).  It has a CD player and a nice stereo system. It is the smoothest riding van we drove. I mean when you sit in this van you feel like you are riding in a Lexus because you can't here any of the outside noise. This particular van has seperate control for the heat and the air conditioning where we can have it blowing in the rear for the kids or whoever is back there. 
The best thing that we loved about the Safari is it's room. I always thought that the outside of there vans were always kind of ugly compared to some of the more &quot;sporty&quot; looking vans but now I know why. It is because they are very roomy on the inside. Instead of GMC cutting corners to make this van &quot;look&quot; better they made it bigger on the inside. My husband and I have 5 kids and we all fit into this van with comfort and ease and still more room to spare. If you need to move around in this van while your on the road it is very easy to do so because of the space.
I must say that if you have a big family or just need a roomy vehicle this is the van to go with. We love it!
