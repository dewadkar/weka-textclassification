            I recently purchased the Nikon CoolPix 700 digital camera. It was a great buy. Its really packed with lots of features and it takes wonderful pictures. The pictures are clear and crisp. One negative side to the camera, if you are a buyer with little or no computer knowledge, this is NOT the camera for you. It would be literaly impossible to upload the pictures on to your pc without knowing a lot about computers.  Like most cameras this digital camera chews through batteries but there is an additional adaptor which is great.  But other then that it is a great camera.  The Nikon CoolPix 700 as a camera is fairly simple to use. I got my 70 year old grandfather up and running in less then 10 minutes. He loves its too.  Its so fun to email my friends pictures of me and my family. I love the options , like the digital zoom , black and white etc.
