            Preface
The following is my account of what I got to experience behind the wheel of the new 2003 Infiniti G35 4 door sedan on a recent test drive. I had just the day before driven the new Mazda Mazda6 of which I had every intention of buying after spending time behind the wheel of that fine machine. However, after driving the G35 I could never look at the 6 the same way again. 

The Dealership
I called Infiniti of Cincinnati before coming out to arrange a test drive of the G35. The salesperson I was transferred to was very courteous and invited me to come out when I could and he would let me drive the car. I told him I would be there in about 20 minutes as they were close by to my work and a snow storm was inbound later that day. When I got to the dealership I asked for the salesperson I spoke to and he took me just outside the front entrance and stopped by a G35 that was already running. He said he had started it so it would be warm and ready to go when I got there. Not a bad gesture on a cold, 30 degree, Cincinnati day!

Interior Impressions
When I first climbed into the G35 to begin my drive, it felt as if I had just boarded a personal jet made up of an environment of plush leather seats and stunning attention to every detail to make me feel as if this car was made just for me and my fastidious tastes. The leather seats were unlike that of any car I had been in before. Granted, the price range of cars I have always had were in the upper $20&#146s, but guess what? So is this vehicle! The seats were soft, supple, and came in a beautiful willow color. The seat controls were to the right of the seat. While I have read numerous reviews complaining of this feature, I found it very convenient. It was very nice for a change not to have to try and wedge my hand in between the door and the side of the seat to make adjustments. One gripe would be that I did not think the seat went back far enough from the steering wheel. That is, at least nowhere near the distance you would get in a two door sports car. It was, however, adequate for me at my height of 5'11&#148. 

The center console was absolutely gorgeous. The version I drove did not have the Premium Package so it was of the dark grey tone instead of the less loved silver color. It had no plastic feel and gave me the sensation of smooth velvet when I touched it. There was a small storage area above the center console where the optional navigation system would be housed if chosen. While it would not be able to hold CD&#146s, it could definitely be a useful storage space for items such as travel Kleenex and a hoard of other small things. Just below the storage area was where the radio and climate controls were housed. The controls were tastefully displayed and felt like they were just where they needed to be when I reached over to adjust them. On the top part of the dash is a display bar that shows what direction you&#146re heading (digital compass) and the climate settings. This setup reminded me of my time behind the wheel of the Mazda6. The space was very good and there was plenty of headroom even with the optional moonroof. Below the moonroof just above rearview mirror was a sunglass holder which was the push type with slow deploy. Very tasteful. 

The center console between the front seats houses a pretty decent storage bin for CD&#146s with their cases and even has a coin tray. Farther down towards the shift gate is a push button cover that houses two cupholders. While there is not much space between the cupholders, they could easily hold two large drinks (not supersized) together.

The version I drove did not come with the optional Bose sound system and I would argue that I think the Bose would not be needed. The sound was great and had great bass. The system was far better than the Mazda6 I drove that came with a Bose system. I could easily live with this system with no aftermarket speakers/subs at all. 

The climate system was also excellent and very easy to operate. It was quiet and very efficient. A carbon filter also comes standard.  

The back seat was also spacious and offered rear knee room that was bounds and leaps above the Mazda6 and was more than adequate for any sized adult. While it was not as much as a car like the Cadillac Deville, it was as generous as an Accord and the like that gave some breathing room between your legs and the front seats. These seats were just as soft and supportive like the front. The only downside was the large hump where the transmission is housed in the middle that would make it difficult to transport 3 adults.


The trunk was also great and came with gas struts that did not eat into cargo space. The cargo space was great (with the space saver spare tire) as well. The only downside I saw was that the rear seats do not fold and the only path to the cabin is through a small opening in the center console in the back seat. Hopefully, Infiniti will address this in the 2004 model.     

Driving Impressions

-Highway
This part is what I have to say made me love this car more than any other I have ever driven. The car was running when I got into it so I promptly turned it off and restarted it to see what it sounded like when it was started. Needless to say I was not disappointed. While it was not as loud as a Mustang GT firing up it was enough to remind you that you were behind the wheel of very sporty car. 

The shift gate was very plain but very nice. It was completely different than the Mazda6 but I actually liked it better. The Mazda6 was like trying to navigate a maze while shifting from park to drive, while the G35 could be shifted into drive by just pulling down on the shifter until it stopped. 

Once in Drive, I began my test drive of this amazing 260HP machine. I promptly headed straight for Interstate 71 to see how it would handle on the highway since I spend a lot of time on them daily. When entering the on ramp I pushed the accelerator about 3/4 the way down and it responded immediately with a surge of power. It had no lag like the Mazda6 and made me reminisce about the time I had owned an '89 Ford Taurus SHO. While you may think &#147Taurus? How could that compare?&#148 You obviously have not been lucky enough to get behind the wheel of the first year SHO production that had the engine made by Yamaha before Ford made their own engine and ruined a great sedan. Since I departed with my beloved SHO I have never found a car with an engine that has been as buttery smooth and responsive as it UNTIL the G35. 

While on the highway I absolutely fell in love with this car. About a mile into driving I looked down at the amber lit speedometer and it said I was going 80MPH! It felt more like I was cruising around 50MPH! There was not a hint of wind rush or sound from semis and other cars I passed as well as no vibration or engine noise whatsoever. Once again, I thought I was behind the wheel of my SHO except the G35 had better soundproofing, drag coefficient, ride quality, leather seating, and dash quality. The steering was dead on and exhibited no drift to the left or right whatsoever when I took my hands off the wheel. Needless to say, I had found my highway cruiser. 

-Around Town
Now the question was how would it handle around town? After I realized I found my highway cruiser, I took the next exit ramp which was a few miles away from the dealership. Coming off the exit ramp at 80MPH I got to test the brakes as I came to the stop light at the end. Once again, I was amazed. The brakes, while VERY sensitive, were phenomenal. I usually begin hitting the brakes in my Isuzu VehiCROSS almost as soon as I exit the highway. When I did the same thing in this car I found I was slowing too rapidly. These brakes were so good that the best way to describe how good their stopping power was is to compare them to a WWC wrestling match where one guy throws his opponent into the ropes and as he rebounds puts his arm out and clotheslines him dropping him to the canvas instantly stopping him. 

Driving around town really showed me what I was missing as well. It took bumps and small potholes with ease and the ride was very supple. I had all but forgotten the Mazda6 at this point. The steering was tight and very responsive. I tested its turning capability and was absolutely amazed. It rivaled my VehiCROSS (which is great) and felt like it could turn into any tight parking space or make a U turn on any road no matter how small.

The automatic transmission version I drove comes with a manual mode 5 speed as well. It performed flawlessly and satisfied my hunger to race through the gears myself. However, the 5 speed automatic was so smooth and responsive I don&#146t think the manual mode is needed. 

Conclusion
Overall, this is the best car I have ever driven for the price. I was very impressed with the dealer treatment which should be similar to all others per the Infiniti website and I was made to feel like a very important client as opposed to a typical customer that I have grown accustomed to at Ford, Chevy, and Isuzu. Comparing it to the Mazda6 is not fair as the two are not even in the same class after driving them. This vehicle defines entry level luxury. I have driven a BMW 3 series and was not as impressed as I was in this car. I can honestly say that if you are in the market for a car and do not want to spend over $30k, look at this vehicle! You can get leather power seats, Xenon lights, and a moonroof for under $30k after negotiating and I don&#146t think any other car can touch it in this price range. I certainly see why it was named as the 2003 Motor Trend Car of the Year. While I think the 2 door coupe is sexier (compare the rear view), the 4 door is amazing and a true luxury sedan that can transport 4-5 people with ease.

It would be hard to imagine what could be better than this car for less than $30k with leather power seats, Xenon lights, and a moonroof.
