            If you prefer a soft luxurious ride, the adoration of common yuppies, or that extra drink holder, then do not purchase a Jeep Wrangler.

If you prefer the wind in your hair, mud falling from the sky, reaching the backwoods regardless of road conditions, having self respect, and knowing you purchased a true utility vehicle, then get a Jeep Wrangler.

I have owned several SUVs.  None of them have given me the satisfaction and the fun I have had with my Jeep Wrangler.

The Jeep Wrangler does not come with a lot of extras and has remained a very straight forward vehicle; this likely explains the affordable price.  I think it is a great value compared to the rest of the SUV market.

I purchased the extra sound rack so that I could actually hear the radio while driving, which also has the added feature of providing a dome light.

There isn't any sound insulation which makes the drive noisy at times.  The rag top and doors are not meant for protection except from the elements.  The steering is unlike any other vehicle I've driven and care should be taken around corners. (If you work for Jeep and you read this, do not attempt to change these aspects of the Wrangler; IMHO they keep the Wrangler in a class of its own).
