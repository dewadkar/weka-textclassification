BMW just came out with a new standard for ultra
luxury production cars. It raises the bar, and it
has one cool feel to it.

Interior/Exterior

The 2002 7 series boasts a new body, chassis, driveline,
and suspension. Functionally it remains the same.
The new 745si is an inch and a half longer wider and taller
than its predecessor.  Wheelbase is also longer.
It has quad headlights with illuminated rings and a
distinctive grille.  Above the headlights it has
a unique eyebrow-like turn signal.  The adaptive
brakelight is also dynamic discouraging rear-end
impacts.

Power Systems

4.4 liter V8 now puts out almost the same horsepower
as the old V12. Fuel economy is 18 miles to the gallon 
in the city and 26 on the highway.  Transmission
has 6 very fast changing automatic gears
controlled by switches on the steering wheel. 
The traditional gearshift lever is gone.

Sophisticated

Doors open and close in a new way. When you are on
a steep hill opening a heavy door, the BMW door
will stay open and not slam close. You will not
need to yank the door closed either.  Pull it near
and the mechanism will close the door. Trunk works
similarly. There is a programmable switch on
the steeering wheel. For example, the
navigation system shows the center of the tachometer.
The iDrive system allows you to incorporate
two unique features: the parking brake, which
actually engages automatically and the automatic
hold which holds the car in position after you come
to a stop. There is a lot of thought put into this
car...and while the learning curve may be steep for
some...it is a sophisticated piece of machinery

Interior

Leather, natural woods grace this vehicle. Comfort
seats incorporate antiwhiplash mechanism that responds
by quickly supporting your head in a crash. You can
even get a special tubular inflatable structure
in the front and rear seats that offers head protection
even in a rollover accident.
