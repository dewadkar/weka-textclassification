            This camera is nearly perfect out of the box.  Drop the included pair of AA batteries in and start clicking.  The picture quality is the best I've seen in any digital camera.  It takes better pictures than my moms $4000 Minolta 35mm!  When printed on a good photo printer (Canon i960 is a great choice) 8 1/2 X 11 pictures look like professional photography.  This camera is very simple and may not have all the options your looking for if you want a fully loaded $1000 5MP camera.  But for your money you will not find a camera half as good at taking perfect pictures in most normal circumstances.

It has different settings; Sport, Night, Landscape and close up.  It also has movie mode that works almost as well as my Sony Digital camcorder.
The date stamp can be turned off or set to 3 different configurations.  It has long time exposure. (up to 4 seconds) Also has a delay timer.  It has 4 picture quality settings and an orientation sensor, so your pictures will be displayed upright even when you take them sideways.

The 3X optical zoom is fine for everyday use.  It has a threaded lens adapter so I assume you could purchase lenses, filters, and such.  The lens cap is like many older 35mm cameras, or some video cameras.  It snaps on and off over the lens and is attached to the camera with a string.  

I love this camera because of its ease of use, awesome picture quality and small size.  Oh and the price ($338) was good too.
