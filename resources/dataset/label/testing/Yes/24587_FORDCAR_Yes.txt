            I have owned my Contour SE for over a year, bought it with 74,000 miles now has around 109k. The car handles great, the V6 teamed with the 5 speed makes it a lot of fun to drive. The engine is smooth and responds very well to tuning. The 5 speed is a little harsh but I prefer it to the automatic. I bought the car because I wanted a sports car but did not want to pay the high insurance. There is a lot of aftermarket backing for the car. Like I said I wanted a sports car, 170 hp was not enough with just a few thousand dollars you can turn this into a monster, try 295 wheel hp. The cup holder is very flimsy and is better off unused. The interior looks more European than American. The large sidebolsters on the the seats do a great job of holding you in and completing the sport sedan feel. The brakes are adequate. This car has NEVER left me stranded or let me down in any way. If your looking for a sporty sedan and don't mind fixing tedious things I don't think you can find a much better car for your money.
