            Style:  This car has style.  I purchased the 2001 G20t (Touring edition) new, which features fog lamps, ground effects, leather seats, a sunroof, and improved wheels.  In my opinion, the small price increase for the touring package is well-worth the expense -- I'm not sure I would even buy the base model.

I have driven this car solid for the past 2 years.  3 months after I purchased the car, I drove from my home in Baltimore, MD to Seattle, WA -- 7,300 miles in 13 days.  The car performed beautifully, was comfortable the entire ride, handled the plains, the desert, and the mountains (the top of Mt. Evans in Colorado) with no perceivable problems whatsoever.  I have only required unscheduled service on the car twice -- once when I drained the battery (see my stereo comments below) and once when my crazy ex trashed it (a sad day).  I have had ZERO repair issues with the car, and have loved driving it.

The only real complaint with this car is pure power.  For a 4-cylinder engine, the car does well, but a 6-cylinder engine would have made this car a sweet ride on the level of the 2003 G35 Sport Coupe.  You can get a good amount of pep out of the car with overdrive off, once you know how to work the gas pedal, and the cornering is unquestionably strong.  The Bose sound system is excellent -- I had 2 10" subwoofers and a 500-watt amp installed, and the sound is complete in the car, with great sound throughout the car.  (Little front seat/back seat differences.)

Plus, this car turns heads.  It's a sleek car in the vein of the pricier Infiniti, BMW, Lexus, Audi lines, but is very affordable for the average person.  Shine it up, spray down the tires with silicone, and get your slow roll on.
