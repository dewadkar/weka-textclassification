            I purchased my A4 in Winter 1996. It was the second new car I have ever owned and the first one that I purchased via the Internet. This has been my primary vehicle since 1997, however, I own several cars and therefore the car has only traveled about 65k miles.

This is the third Audi I have owned or driven in m life. Previously, I had an Audi 4000, and my father owned a 100LS when I was a teenager, until I wrecked it.

My accident (entirely my fault) in the 100LS sold me on Audi safety. I was racing two other idiot teenagers down a steep windy road, wet with recent rains, and lost control in a curve. I actually could have straightened it up and regained control, but for another car that happened to appear coming up the hill at that moment. So, over the side I went, striking a culvert which flipped the car and sent if rolling down the 45 degree slope of the mountain until it came to a halt on its side, wedged against a tree. The passenger compartment was completely intact, the seatbelt saved my life and I was able to climb out the driver widow, hike up the hill and walk home. Years later I finally confessed to my parents that I hadn't actually swerved to avoid a deer.

This time, I bought the A4 2.8 model, with quattro all wheel drive, and the winter and sport packages, which included the leather interior and sport steering wheel. I also bought the stereo system upgrade, with the Bose speaker package.

Overall, I can say that my experience has been quite positive, without the major problems that a few other reviewers have mentioned. 

I'll mention the few bad things first.

The stereo in the 1997 only appeared for one year, and perhaps as a result, you can't easily find an aftermarket CD changer for it. You will be forced to buy a changer from the dealer, for about $700, and I believe they are not even available anymore. Mine finally failed a year ago, and I drove without one for a several months until I finally adapted the radio and changer from a later year so it would work.

The power steering hoses swell and leak over time. I noticed this before damage was done, as the power steering began to squeal, and I immediately checked the reservoir. Anyone who owns an A4 should check the hoses where they enter the power steering pump for leakage. It looks to me like the hose material was incorrect. Note that the steering fluid is mineral based, and you shouldn't top off with what is available in most auto parts stores, be safe and use Audi fluid.

The edges of the dashboard nearest the windshield have curled slightly over time, undoubtedly due to exposure to the sun. Not really a flaw as all cars age in this way, and fortunately the change has been symmetrical and therefore hard to notice.

The cupholders are a bad joke. They must have been designed by some clever German WWII veteran who hoped to scald as many Americans as possible with hot coffee. They offer no support to the sides, so on sharp turns your cup will simply topple right over on your leg.

I haven't been very conscientious about maintaining the leather, so the left panel of the driver seat is beginning to show its age. The steering wheel has also developed a spot where the finish has eroded.

I like to do my own work on the car, but the service indicator light cannot be reset without an OBDII diagnostic tool.

This was the first car I ever owned that had heated seats, and it's not a feature that comes in very handy here in California. They heat up very slowly, so unless you run the car for ten minutes or so before you get in, they have no effect at all. If you don't wait for them to warm up, then as you drive you are treated to the odd sensation of a warm patch slowly spreading out underneath your pants. A little alarming, to say the least.

The main reason to own this car, and the reason I bought it, is the winter driving performance. I owned a 1994 Isuzu Rodeo 4wd for most of the years that I had the Audi, and I was able to drive both in some serious conditions of ice and snow. The Audi beat the Isuzu hands down in all conditions, despite the fact that the Isuzu had giant M+S tires and 4wd. I lived for a time in a house at the bottom of a steep paved driveway, and although it rarely snowed, only the Audi could climb out on those days. The only downside in snow is the lower ground clearance of the Audi as compared to the Isuzu. On a couple of occasions, the Audi was willing, but only the Isuzu was able to ford the deep stuff. I can heartily recommend this car as a ski vehicle.

The engine performance is adequate, but not exciting. It is so smooth that when I first bought the car I had to look at the tach to decide if the engine was running. Several times I ground the starter thinking that the engine was stopped.

The ski sack is a great feature, the interior has a quality feel, The style of the car is excellent and for me at least, the car has been reliable. 

Audi service (Barrier Audi in Redmond WA) was quick and competent during the warranty period, despite my having purchased the vehicle at another dealership.

I've owned the vehicle now for almost eight years, and the style has become a little boring for me. I now prefer the look of the later A6 models. I will probably give the car to one of my family members so I can move on to something new. I am seriously considering an Audi Allroad, which would solve the ground clearance problem, give me more power, and a little extra room to haul people and equipment.
