            After trying every set-up known to man to get accurate SCANS of the jewelry I sell, I decided some things were just NOT meant to be scanned.

I should have purchased a digital camera ages ago, but didn't because of one freakin' comment from a friend while at the World Horror Con in... Phoenix, I think.  Anyway, I was told, "Oh, the resolution is awful.  They really suck for image-quality."  So I figured it was like a Polaroid... you can have fun and get instant gratification, but if you want quality... steer clear.

So years passed and when I looked again... oh my!  What choices!  What prices!  What options!  

Again, going for instant gratification (which I tend to do), I did a minor investigation and ordered online.

I'm sure I didn't get the best deal... and be careful... the price you're quoted is often for the body only... like with no lens or something.  To get the whole set up, which for me included extra lenses/filters, extra memory, USB connector, battery and charger... cost like $750 including shipping.  

My main focus when choosing a camera was that it needed macro and an awesome clarity resolution.  So I had to go big megabytes.

Nikon doesn't even have the 995 on their site anymore, though.  Things get out-dated so fast.

Bottom line: I&#146m a fairly intelligent person, but I&#146m barely scratching the surface of what this camera can do.  It comes with a novel-length book of instructions, but it wasn&#146t interesting reading so I put it off.

I try to go by what it says on the LCD menu or what shows in the monitor screen, but let&#146s just say I&#146ve only mastered the basics.

I doubt there&#146s much this camera isn&#146t good for (oh&#133 if double negatives bother you&#133 I&#146ll bet this camera does most things, if not everything, really well).

You can choose which resolution you take your pictures in, thus giving you fewer pix per card with tremendous resolution (clarity&#133 ability to &#147blow up&#148 and see great detail), or you can lower the res for many more shots on a card (say you&#146re going to Disneyland and don&#146t need to see Uncle Fred&#146s nose hairs in fine detail but you DO need to come home with about 50 pictures&#133 problem solved).  There are res in-between settings also.

There seem to be two flash&#133 deals.  One, the pop-up, and one on the face of the camera.

It&#146s a great feature to be able to rotate the lens/monitor separately to get the angle you want on the picture.

The zoom is fabulous.

I tried experimenting with lighting options for shooting in incandescent versus fluorescent and it seemed like a good thing, but I usually just let the camera decide what to do (automatic settings) because it usually makes better choices than I.

There are some things I will definitely have to force myself to figure out soon, like how to set the aperture wide so I can get an out-of-focus background, etc.

I haven&#146t even ever used the timer feature (had the thing for almost 2 years now).

All in all, it is a PERFECT camera for me and my needs (which were basically to take close-up pictures of jewelry).  

For regular family camera use, it may be overkill, but for $360 (if you can really get it for that), I&#146d go for the glory no matter WHAT you need it for.

Another nice thing it does is saves battery.  If I&#146m taking a series of shots, but fiddling around with the items between exposures&#133 the camera puts itself into like &#147sleep mode&#148 and with a slight touch on the shutter button it springs back to life.

It&#146s a great camera with a lot of range and a trustworthy reputation.  

I used to be quite the avid photographer, but in my old age, I traded in the fully manual Pentax for this &#147Don&#146t worry, Laura&#133 I&#146ll do it for you&#148 Nikon.  I also now drive an automatic&#133 sigh.  With this camera, I don&#146t worry about lighting, back-lighting, exposure, speed, or even focus!  

By the way, for those of you who think good digital cameras are expensive&#133 I can&#146t begin to tell you how much money I no longer spend on: film, developing, printing, enlargements, copies, etc.

You will also find yourself less restrictive about &#147getting JUST the right shot&#148 because there&#146s NO FILM to waste&#133 take as many pictures as you want and within seconds you can narrow it down to the best 2 or 3.  

So here are the technical specs.
