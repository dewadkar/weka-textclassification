            I bought this vehicle while in Germany because I wanted something that would scoot right-along, yielded good gas mileage, and had the main safety feature of out-maneuvering an accident instead of getting into it.

This vehicle was more than capable of doing all these things and much more.  I didn't really understand why it was such an expensive car in the beginning but now I do.  Built of primarily Aluminum and Stainless Steel, she has little to absolutely NO-RUST or SALT-CORROSION whatsoever!  I have friends whom are on their third car since my purchase of this car.  Handling, this car's not on rails, it put the rails there.  I've driven much more expensive cars that simply cannot touch this car's handling, STOCK I might add!  The world's smallest HIGH-REVVING mass production V6 ever made.  You can drop a larger 2.5 KL-ZE motor in the engine bay if you want even more fun with little modification.  The speed-sensitive power steering makes the car safer, adding more boost at low speeds, less at higher.  The sound system from Mazda from the manufacturer was a solid kick-ass!  The brakes, four-wheel disc are outstanding, better than a Corvette's in many cases.  If you need to stop, you will.

I have only two &quot;so-called&quot; hates.  The darn automatic seatbelts and that I was stuck with power windows without choice (I don't like to have to power-up a vehicle just to roll down a damn window!).  

Driving the car is strange at first, like a bathtub.  You can see in every direction ALL-AROUND, glass everywhere.  Where you turn, it goes.  Speed-wise, mine topped out at 143mph in Germany.  I DO NOT CONDONE YOU TRY THAT IN A SPEED LIMITED AREA. 

This car is great for people who want better than average performance in the price range, and those who put safety before &quot;air-bags.&quot;  It's great for singles without children.  It is not a family car and should not be constured as so.

Road and Track wrote an article about Pocket Rockets, they voted this number 1!  After having mine for nine years, and looking for the competition from those years, I don't see them around whatsoever, I'd say they made an excellent choice, as did I when I bought the 1992 Mazda MX-3 GS!<br><br>
