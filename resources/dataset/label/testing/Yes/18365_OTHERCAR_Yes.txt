            We have had our Villager for 9 months.  It was the first minivan that we had ever purchased.  We have thoroughly enjoyed its riding qualities, spaciousness, and handling.  We also find it very easy to enter , especially for my wife who  wears a below-knee prosthesis.  

We have also appreciated the service we have received from the Mercury dealer.  We have not received comparable service from our GM dealer in the past. 

This vehicle is the ideal vehicle for families with children.  I also believe that it is a much easier vehicle for the more mature person for entering and exiting.  The door openings seem much better for tall people.

I am well pleased with my Mercury Villager.<br><br>
