            Purchased our Ford Series F150 Pickup truck a little over a year and a half ago.  
We based our decision to purchase this model after extensive searching for over 2 months.
 Our decision to purchase this truck came from owning a Ford Bronco for o
over 10 years.  
We are happy with the purchase but would rather have had an Expedition if we could have afforded it.  
The truck is easy to handle and tows really well also.  The extended cab with the third door also makes it very nice for traveling.
It is nice for a family with small children as the back seat though small, is quite comfortable for a small person.
We ordered it with all the extras so even for a truck it is quite nice.  
Since trucks are so popular, at least in our area, we feel quite confident in our purchase.
The only down side to owning a truck is that the ride is a little rougher than the traditional 4X4 Bronco that we had.<br><br>
