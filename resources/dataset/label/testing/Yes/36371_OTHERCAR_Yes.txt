                 When I was at the used car lot, I did not know what kind of car that I wanted.  I had just gotten rid of an old klunker that stopped running.  The dealer, (who was my neighbor,) pointed me in the direction of a '94 Accord.  Boy am I lucky.  I later realized that the Accord was probably the best car that I could have gotten.  It has a very smooth ride, it is roomy enough to seat 5 people comfortably, and it is pretty darn quick (thanks to the 2.2L V-tech engine.)  The car handles very well and it is actually very fun to drive.  The gas mileage is superb, but what do you expect from the most efficient engine design in the world.  I was suprised at how fast my car really was.  Of coarse it is not going to win the LeMans, but if you can't afford a Corvette and you want to go faster than a Geo, this is the car for you. Since I bought an EX model, I can enjoy leather seats, cruise control, and an automatic sun roof.  This car can definitely please a variety of people.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.<br><br>
