            When I bought my Ford Taurus GL it wasn't exactly the car of my dreams.  Personally I thought the shape of the car was ugly.  But for the price it wasn't a bad car.

Actually I've only had two problem with my car since I bought in 1999.  The first problem was the oil pan.  The oil pan rotted away which wouldn't of been too much of a big deal other than the fact I was driving the car when the oil light came on.  So I pulled into the nearest parking lot.  And there was just a ton of oil leaking out of the bottom of my car.  I called my husband and I thought he was going to have heart attack.  But it turned out just to be the oil pan.  The second problem is that darn interior light.  I'm not sure how many miles were on the car when this light started to stay on all of the time.  But it is a pain.  I ended up taking the light bulb out of the dome so that I can still drive it at night.  It seems to be fine in the winter.  But in the summer the light always tends to be on.  

I live in New England and the winters here can be really bad.  My Taurus has been great in the snow.  It gets me where I need to go without a problem.  I work 30 miles away from my home and I've never had a problem getting to work with my Taurus.  

Initially this wasn't the car I wanted.  But I was pleasantly surprised with how reliable the car is.  I'd have to say that when it's time to replace my Taurus most likely I will buy another one.  Unless I run into more problems.  Right now the car has almost 100,000 miles on it and it's still running strong.  I'm hoping the car will last another 3 years since my husband just bought a Mercury Mountaineer.  We'll see.
