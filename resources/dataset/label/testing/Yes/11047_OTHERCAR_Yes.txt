            First, I would buy another and recommend the same for two very important reasons:
   Exterior Size is right.  Fold-Away Rear Seat is a must.

BUT, There are a handful of little things that you should take notice of before you buy.   There shift lever is too long, the arm rests are too low, the heater vent to the right of the driver (which should be in the middle of the dash to send air the to 2d row) either blows in the driver's face or at his arm pit, the brake lever and the little fold-away tray get in the way for walking to the back (or setting a small cooler), and the drivers seat cushion is rather hard and makes my leg go numb.

After 13 years with a Caravan and giving up hope that Chrysler would ever put in a folding rear seat, and noticing that all the other mini-vans had become un-mini, we chose the Mazda and have be pleased with its overall quality, utility and comfort.

Mazda's insists on installing the hideous roof-rack (though the company claims it is an "option") and the Hagerstown MD dealer's "take-it-or-leave-it attitude" caused me to look elsewhere.  Koon's Mazda, Westminster MD, was where we found sales people that actually tried to get us what we wanted.

The controls are well laid out except that the rear wiper control complicates the front wiper control.  The stereo system's controls are, unlike many, designed for use rather than splashy looks.  Removing the 2d row seats is a little tricky, but the 3d seat is a charm.  Acceleration is good, mileage is so-so.  The industry-wide practise of sloping windshields and curved rears decreases utility, but the low wind noise and cross-wind stability may be worth the cost.
