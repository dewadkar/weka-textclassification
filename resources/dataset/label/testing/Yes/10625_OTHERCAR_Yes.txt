            I purchased my Leganza on 7/4/2000 and was very impressed from the first moment that I set my eyes on it. I stopped by the dealership on a whim, I had just got done looking at a new Saturn and a Honda. On previous cars that I owned there were always options that I &quot;wish&quot; I could afford. Well, not anymore. 

I was very impressed by the dealership (Sacramento, Ca). I basically did not have to ask any questions. Renee, the sales person, basically walked me bumper to bumper and told me about ALL the features that the car offered for the price. I was amazed. When I looked at the interior of the car I was thinking &quot;Lexus&quot; and actually Daewoo did have some of the same engineers design the interior of the Leganza that had worked on the Lexus. I have every option that I wanted for under $20k. An equally well equipped Accord will cost you about another $6k. I actually like the design of the Leganza more than the Accord anyway. Also with the Leganza you get all scheduled maintenance in the first 3 years free, including oil changes. The factory warranty is comparable as well. 

I have only had my Leganza for a short time, but so far I think it's pretty cool. It's kind of neat to see people checking out my nice car and not really know what the heck it is immediately. <br><br>
