            This review is not about this particular car; it is about Saturn in general.  I am not currently a car owner, but have driven many different makes of cars.  When I buy a car again, I would never consider any kind of car but a Saturn.

What impressed me at first was that there was no haggling about the price.  I had managed to save up a $1000 down payment, and called Saturn of Marietta (Georgia, north of Atlanta).  I told the salesperson over the phone exactly what I wanted: dark green coupe. nothing fancy except air conditioning, power windows, and automatic  transmission.  He had one in stock fitting my needs, and agreed to check out my credit over the phone.   I went to Marietta by bus two days later, and drove out in my car.  There was no haggling on the price; the dealership had worked a miracle in getting me reasonable financing; and I was now a car owner for the first time in my life! 

I followed up religiously on the maintenance.  The respect  the maintenance side of the dealership showed me was on a par with the sales side.  Appointments were honored within five minutes of scheduled time.  There were two comfortable waiting rooms, one with television and one without, and lots of magazines, as well as coffee and doughnuts.  Maintenance was always finished on time as well, and customers are paged by their last names (Mr., Ms. plus name).  This is much unlike other dealerships where I have had service (such as Bablylon Chrysler-Plymouth in New York's Suffolk County) where fifty people were given the same appointment time, and one could count on waiting six hours for a five minute check up.  In this dealership, people were paged by their first names.  (I was brought up in a military family, and have always called people not known to me by their title and last name; the uncalled-for familiarity shown to me by the little gum-chewing snits over at Babylon Chrysler-Plymouth was a real turn-off). 

When we subsequently moved to Daytona Beach, and then  Oxnard, California, and took the Saturn with us, we followed up on maintenance in the same way, and were pleased to see that at all the maintenance locations (as well as one we needed to visit en route, in Texas, to get new windshield wiper blades) treated us with the same degree of respect as did the dealership in Marietta.

We subsequently sold the car to the Saturn dealership in Oxnard.  I had bought the bumper to bumper warranty, and over the four years I owned the car had paid a total of $65 for uncovered repairs.  Very impressive!  When we bought the car, we were told what we could expect to get for it if we sold it four years from then, and the price we got was only $300 under what we had been quoted.  Very impressive!

My daughter has since bought her first car of her own, and it too was a Saturn, purchased in San Diego.

There are no Saturn dealerships here in Puerto Rico, where I live now, otherwise I surely would buy one here.  As it is, I would never consider any other make of car.  The car itself was good; the service was great.  Good cars are easy to come by; great service is not.  That is why I am a confirmed Saturn junkie!<br><br>
