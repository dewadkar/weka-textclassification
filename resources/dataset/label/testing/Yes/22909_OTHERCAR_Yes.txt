            <b> BACKGROUND </b>

I really wasn't looking to buy a new car, but Nissan offered some great incentives on the Sentra earlier this year and I bit.

<b> INTRODUCTION </b>

I ended up purchasing  a 2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R with an automatic. 

<b> ENGINE </b>

The car comes standard with a massive (for a compact car) 2.5 liter DOHC 4 which generates 165HP. To put this in perspective this is far more horsepower than you will get in a  Civic/Corrola/Lancer/Elantra. On the down side, the EPA rated mileage is 23 city/28 highway and this is also less than you'll get with a Civic/Corrola/Lancer and Elantra. I average about 24mpg with AC and 26mpg without AC both in mixed urban driving. Nobody ever said power doesn't come without a price :-)

<b> STYLING </b> 

The Sentra was all new in 2000 and it was a fresh design then. I have to admit that now it looks a bit dated. Having said that with the exception of the Corrola I don't find the styling of other cars in this class to be trend setting. 

<b> INTERIOR </b> 

The Sentra comes in only a four door. All Sentra's seat passengers with buckets up front and a 60/40 split fold down rear seat. The SE-R comes standard with maplights and a handy overhead storage compartment for sunglasses. Rear leg room is tight and front leg room is average for compacts. The biggest complaint about this car is that the interior materials look cheap and the critics are right. Driver controls are simple and well laid out, with the driver seat being 4 way adjustable (manual). Road noise is improved from early model years with better insulation. Still, there is a fair amount of road noise especially at high speeds, but the 180 watt 7 speaker system does a good job of drowing everything else out.

<b> PERFORMANCE </b> 

The engine in the SE-R is the same as in the base Nissan Altima. In the smaller Sentra it is VERY potent. So much so, that torque steer is a major problem under hard acceleration. Having said that, I consider that a problem I'd like to deal with as this car does not suffer from being underpowered like most compacts. The Sentra handles very well, but at the expense of ride quality as the SE-R gets bone rattling sports tuned suspension. For those who want more power, with a more refined ride consider the 2.5 LE which has the same engine, but the same softer suspension tuning as the GXE. Personally, I love the car in the summer when roads are smooth and I can drive fast. I curse it in the winter when every pothole is bone jarring. The SE-R gets 4 wheel disc brakes that do a good job of stopping the car. 

<b> PURSE STRINGS </b> 

The SE-R with automatic transmission has a base price of $16,999. My car came the Sunroof package, floor mats, and a in cabin microfilter bringing the list price up to $18,366. 

I received the following factory to consumer incentives:

1.9% financing for 60 months 
and
$500 cash back. 

Currently (as of late September 2003), Nissan no longer offer incentives on the SE-R but continues to offer them on all other models. 

Compared to the competition the Sentra is cheaper than all but the Dodge Neon and Hyundai Elantra (and you don't want to buy either). It also typically has better incentives than the Honda Civic or Toyota Corrola.

<b> FINAL NOTES </b> 

If you like a powerful sedan which looks pedestrian and is relatively cheap to insure look into the Sentra SE-R. It's not the most refined car in its class but it is the best bang for the money.
