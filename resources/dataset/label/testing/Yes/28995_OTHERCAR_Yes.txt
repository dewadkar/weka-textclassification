            [UPDATE, 20-Dec-2001 - almost two years later: the car is still going strong, running well.  No unscheduled maintenance.  Still comfortable, safe, and everything I wrote below still applies]

The Honda CR-V is the <i>only</i> car on the market that met our requirements: 4WD, ABS, comfort, reliability, mileage, cost.

What eliminated the competition was <b>roominess</b>.  I'm 6'3, my wife 5'11.  Neither of us is skinny.  Not only did we require a car with enough head, hip, and leg room for us in front, we wanted one where we could carry passengers.  <i>No other car</i> in the less-than-$25K price range had anything close to the CR-V's back-seat comfort.  

The decision thus boiled down to: buy a CR-V now, or wait a few years for other car makers to get a clue about tall people.  We bought the CR-V... and have been delighted with it.  Here's why:

+ Its <b>comfort</b> is better than we expected.  Santa Fe and Albuquerque, the cities nearest us, are one and two hours away respectively.  Long trips are a fact of life around here, and the CR-V has borne us comfortably to and fro.  

+ The <b>seats are nice and high</b>.  I'm getting on in years (34). It gets tiring, having to stoop and crouch to get into most cars. Stepping up into the CR-V is luxury.

+ Despite persistent rumors about the CR-V's lack of power, its <b>engine is perfectly adequate</b> for hauling what we need -- even at our home elevation of 7,500 feet, where any car is at a disadvantage.  Yes, it lags a bit going up long, steep hills, but I can live with it.  

+ Its ride is <b>smooth</b> and <b>quiet</b>.  The suspension easily handles our less-than-perfect New Mexico roads, and with the windows closed, conversation at normal speaking levels is possible.  Admittedly, this is a relative judgment, and depends on what you're used to... a Lexus or Mercedes owner would have a different opinion.

+ The <b>large side mirrors</b> have been an unexpected bonus. They give a markedly improved feel for traffic around you.

+ The <b>rear passenger windows slide all the way down</b>, without leaving that nasty bit exposed.  That was actually one of our requirements, but given the sad state of what else is out there, we were prepared to live without this.  Fortunately, Honda did the right thing.

+ "Why would I ever want a <b>remote control</b> to get in a car?" Well, so I used to ask.  I'm eating my words now... it's remarkably useful, especially with laden arms!

+ <b>Honda reliability</b>: We plan to own this car for 10-15 years.  The Honda name gives us some assurance that we will.

+ <b>Gas mileage</b> has been what we expect, a very consistent 27 MPG.  Not exactly wonderful, but certainly acceptable.  

And now, some of the negatives:

- The <b>power window switches</b> really <i>are</i> in a stupid place, as everyone else has noted.  No, you don't really get used to them.  This isn't a reason not to buy the car, but good grief, what on earth were they thinking? [UPDATE: The 2002 models have fixed this]

- <b>Rear visibility</b> is less than ideal.  The large side mirrors help, as does removing the back seat headrests (but always keep them handy, and be sure to reinstall them when you carry passengers!). But backing up is tricky; I'm considering a Fresnel.

- The <b>tail lights</b> are mounted disconcertingly high.  I don't know what effect this has on drivers behind, but it concerns me. This can be ameliorated by mounting 3M reflective tape on the bumpers, but I wish the factory had taken care of that.

- The <b>A/C, recirc, and defogger indicator lights are invisible during the daytime</b>, if you drive with the headlights on.  This is a nice feature at night, since their brightness isn't overwhelming, but couldn't they have used a photosensor?


<b>THE BOTTOM LINE</b>: Not only is the CR-V perfect for our needs, it's a car we can enjoy, too -- and feel safe in.
