            I have driven GMC Jimmys since I was a freshman in college (back in 1992!).  My dad has a dealership, and I drove 2- and 4-door Jimmy demonstrators, a different one every 5000 miles or so, until 1996, when I got married and bought one.  In my opinion, these are great SUV's.  They drive and handle well, and if you get a 4.3 L V-6, they have good &quot;pickup&quot;.  They are a good size - for both small people like me and for bigger people like my husband.  There is plenty of room in the back for your stuff (I am active in horse shows, so I NEED lots of room for all of my horsey stuff), and four doors work best for passengers and groceries.  Other than the Jimmy I bought in 1996, I have driven 1999 and 2000 Jimmys, and my opinion doesn't change.  I do like the updates as they occur, such as the gear shift on the floorboard instead of at the wheel, and I have always been pleased with the sound system, including the CD player.  I love the keyless remote entry that is sold as an option.

My 1996 Jimmy never had any problems, mechanical-wise, other than the usual wear-and-tear.  I have known several Jimmy owners, and I have never heard a complaint from any of them regarding the quality of their Jimmys. GMC is a good-quality manufacturer, in my opinion, and can be trusted.

What I wouldn't recommend is the 2-door Jimmy.  It was a pain for people to get in and out of the back seat, and it was also a pain to put groceries or luggage back there too.  Also, there is a significant blind spot because of the way they designed this Jimmy (there is a wide strip between the door and window on the side).  After I drove one of those one summer, I vowed never to buy a 2-door.  

This SUV is good for those who want room but who are not interested in a huge SUV, such as a GMC Yukon or Ford Expedition.  I would not recommend it to people who need to pull a horse trailer or large boat - I drove someone else's 4WD Jimmy while pulling a 2-horse trailer (with 2 horses in it) and I could tell that it was having a hard time.  Over time I think that pulling things like that could tear up the suspension.  They are just not made for that, in my opinion.    This SUV is also not good for those who insist on making tight turns.  Jimmys are top-heavy and narrow, so you have to be careful.

Overall, this SUV is great to drive and looks good on the road.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.  <br><br>
