               I own a 1994 Ford Ranger STX, and I have nothing but good things to say about it!  It has done some amazing things, like pull a full-size Chevy Blazer out of six feet of snow, start in 40below temperatures, and drive 1400 miles accross the country without a stop in 90 degree weather.  It gets good gas mileage, and it has the big meaty tires to get you ANYWHERE no matter what the conditions may be.  It is no surprise that it is the best-selling compact-truck on the market.  Even though I live in Nashville, TN.  I know what the Ranger change do in the extreme conditions of the winter, because I am from North Dakota.  And believe me, once you make it through a winter in North Dakota, you can defeat any condition.  The Ford Ranger has surprised me on it's power and performance.  Even though it's a 1994 model, I still get compliments on it's looks.
   In closing, I would give the highest recommendation on purchasing a Ford Ranger, it is a solid truck with good styling, and a powerful engine.  It is very dependable by means of my own experiences.  If you are on the market to buy a new or used compact-truck, The Ranger is your choice.<br><br>
