            The M5 BMW is an amazing car that will take your breath away the first time you press the accelerator. The M5 takes the place of the 540i six speed sedan. The M5 is the first M car powered by a V-8 engine

The M5 features a special induction system with eight individual throttles and it is BMW's first V-8 engine equipped with double VANOS. The horsepower of the M5 is 400 and it's rpm is 6600. It is a gas car and has a 4.9 liter engine. 

The M5 can fit 5 people in it with 2 in the front and 3 in the back. The weight of the M5 is 4,024 and has an overall length of 188 inches.

The M5 also gets 13 miles per gallon in the city and 21 miles per gallon on the highway.

The overall price of the M5 is around 78,000 dollars. The M5 also has many good looking colors and has 2 main interior styles: Sport and Exclusive.

I think the M5 is a great car for all ages especially young people. Once you get in the car it feels like a airplane.

When you drive the M5 people will always look back at your car and say &quot; I have got to get me one of those&quot;<br><br>
