            I originally wanted an Astro van because of its cargo carrying capacity, but after owning it for several months, I loved it.  It rides nice and the front seats are very comfortable on long trips.  I get about 20 miles to the gallon, even when using air conditioning, which isn't bad for its size.  The standard radio/cassette system isn't much to brag about, but that can be customized.  
The other feature that I like is that the oil filter is accessible from the underside, and that is a big plus since I like to do basic oil changes at home in the driveway.
I have driven my Astro van alot and have had very few things go wrong.  I would, however, recommend getting extended warranty.  I saved me alot of money.
