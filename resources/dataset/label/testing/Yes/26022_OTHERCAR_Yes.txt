            I bought my Cavalier in March of this year. 2 doors, manual gearbox, AC. And since that moment, I just enjoy it everyday of my life. 
First I really love the shape of the body, look really nice. The price was correct (If one compare price/quality). But truly my first motivation was the body.
As I say I use it on an everyday basis, about 1 hour a day, mostly in town and I appreciate its smooth engine, its AC, the view you have from inside (no dead angle) and the motor doesn't cost that much on gas.
As i bought a 2 doors, I knew I was going to get trouble if I needed to carry passengers.. And I did, and I did get problem. Not from the space (more than generous) but mainly for the passenger to get in and out.
On highway, the car feel great, maybe with shock absorber a little harder it will be better. The engine is pretty silencious and you have a safe sensation from the car.

I consider myself young - 28 years - and I think it's an appropriate car for young people,...without kids!
