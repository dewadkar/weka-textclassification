            I still remember the day like it was yesterday.  The day I got my first truck.  Granted, our family has been driving SUV's and trucks for years, but this was MY first truck.  All mine. 

 My husband and I had been wandering around the car lot, more out of boredom than necessity, and as I turned the corner, there she sat.  The most beautiful truck I had ever laid my eyes on.  A brand new, super exciting Ford F-150 Flareside.  I wistfully ran my hand over the flawless paint and opened the door.  My nostrils were immediately flooded with that special, no-smell-like-it-in-the-world odor that is exclusive to all new vehicles.  Talk about aromatherapy!  

As expected, a salesman soon spotted us.  I swear those car lots have some sort of hidden lookout tower.  &quot;Covenleader, this is Raven�. pigeons spotted at location 6�.over and out!&quot;  It usually takes less than a minute to be flocked to.  So I watched the salesman approach with his cheesy pasted smile and listened to his droning speech for almost a full minute before I politely cut him off.  &quot;We are not buying, Sir.  We are just looking.&quot;

To my surprise, and I mean SURPRISE, my husband looked at me and asked very seriously with a perfectly straight face:  &quot;Do you want this truck?&quot;  Well, um�yeah, pretty much, hun.  I stared rather blankly at him and he repeated the question.  
&quot;Do you WANT the truck, Anni?&quot;  I nodded stupidly.  

I found myself driving that truck home that very night.  My husband can be such a NICE man sometimes.

My new F-150 Flareside 4x4 was a single cab truck with a V-8 engine.  I did not want the extended cab because this was my truck and I had a van to haul the offspring around.  It came with after-market chrome tube steps with black footrests so you could easily climb into and out of the truck.  The interior was a pretty tan scotch-guarded fabric.  It had a center console that could be flipped up to accommodate a third passenger or flipped down for an armrest for solo drives.  The console top opened up to reveal slots for your silver change and ample room for your CD's and audiocassettes.  The F-150 Flareside comes equipped with plenty of comfort and safety features, also.  Power windows and seats, air, anti-lock brakes, dual air bags; all the standard stuff of newer vehicles.  The rim of the bed was lined with hard black rubber to protect from scrapes and other damage when loading the vehicle.  It also contributed to the truck's sporty look.  I was a bit disappointed that the truck did not come with the sliding window that some of them do.  I like my fresh air, or at least as fresh as I can possibly get it living in Southern California!

As far as roominess goes, this truck can accommodate a very large man.  All you big guys out there, you are in for a treat.  Lots of legroom and you don't have to drive with your poor stomach smashed up against the steering wheel.  One of the trucks that I test- drove, I believe it was a Chevy, was cramped for even my 5'8 frame.  Forget that noise.  Not only is it uncomfortable, it's downright dangerous.  My son is 6'6 and 280 and loved this truck.

One of the best features this vehicle offered was the option to turn off the passenger side airbag to enhance the safety of children when they are riding in the truck.  Children under 12 can easily be killed by an airbag, and my 7 year old son loved riding in this truck, so I felt much better about having him in it.  Disabling the airbag is quite simple.  All you do is insert your ignition key in the keyhole on the dash of the truck and turn to the &quot;off&quot; position.  

Additionally, the truck came with the 4x4 option.  You can easily enable it from the interior of the vehicle.  I never used that option, so I really cannot elaborate much on it.  My truck just happened to have that feature, even though I had no real use for it.  It did increase my insurance rates, however, and probably lowered my gas mileage a bit.  Incidentally, this particular truck gets about 14-16 miles per gallon.

The payload of the truck is about 2 tons, I believe.  Again, I am seriously mechanically impaired and cannot intelligently elaborate on some of the engine specs and other stuff like that.  My only concern was to hop in and drive.  The rest I left up to my husband.

Alas, like many good things, my days of driving this fantastic truck sadly came to an end. Our van was getting old and costing us more to repair than it was worth, and my husband's Mustang, while a very nice car, had no room for the family when we wanted to take trips.  We needed a larger vehicle, and after much debate and a even a bit of resentment, I reluctantly relinquished my F-150 for the good of the many (yes, I was the few) and we purchased a 2000 Ford Excursion, which, by the way, I have grown to appreciate every bit as much as the F-150.

I will never forget owning this truck.  It was easy to drive, not bad on gas, and I felt that it was at least as safe as any other truck for driver and passengers.  It was the first really beautiful material thing that I had in my life that I could really call my very own.  And frankly, (yes, there IS some show-off in me), it was rather cool driving around in a truck that looked better than a lot of guy's trucks.  Oh the DIRTY looks I got!  It was great! 

 Somewhere in the future, I know that there is another truck like this one, just waiting on some lot for me to come and claim it!
