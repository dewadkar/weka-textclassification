            In my almost six years of driving, I have owned 6 different cars. The least impressive of which was an 86 VW GTI (my first car), and the most impressive was a 95 BMW 325i Convertible. Of my 6 cars, none can even aspire to compare to my 1990 Honda Accord EX Coupe. I bought the car when I was 17, it was my 3rd car. I had owned a 1991 Honda CRX prior, and I was ready for a &quot;real&quot; car. 

This car stuck with me for 3 years. I think if I had even tried to intentionally kill it, I probably could not have done so. This car wrote the book on reliability. I drive 30,000+ miles per year. At the time I bought this car, my father and mother lived about 3.5 hours apart and I used to travel between the two frequently. In addition to this, I have a thing for road trips. 

<b>Design:</b>
The interior on this car is well laid out for the most part. The seat is rather low and doesn't adjust to a great number of positions, but it's comfortable, especially for people like me who have lower back issues. My main complaint about this car's interior is that the center instrument console is flat and forward. It's difficult to reach, especially if you aren't looking directly at it. They corrected this on the next generation of Accord by making the center console angled toward the rear of the car. All of the buttons are easily reached otherwise, and the climate control system is easy to use. The temperature adjustment knob on this car would constantly crack and need to be replaced. I was told by Honda that this was a design flaw of some sort. I think I only had to replace it a total of 4 times. There is a double cup holder in front of the shifter that I took advantage of on many long drives (double latte w/ vanilla shot). The glove compartment is decent sized, and there are good-sized cubbyholes in the doors. The interior on my Accord was cream colored; I don't recommend it to anyone unless you live somewhere where there is no sun, dirt, or snow. I had the automatic seat belts which at best can be described as highly annoying. The electric windows move swiftly and contrary to the warnings of my nagging mother, the sunroof never leaked. The rear seat folds down, adding even more space to the already huge trunk. The rear seat can accommodate two adults comfortably. 

This car is really fun to drive. I had the EX version, which has the most horsepower of all the accords. The power was great, although not a racecar. It�s handling was exceptional, especially through curves and on windy roads. Wet roads were a definite weak point for this car. The weight distribution combined with the wide wheelbase gave it a tendency to slide out easily. I was able to help this somewhat by putting Michelin RoadHandler tires on it. As with any front-wheel drive car, it has a tendency to under steer through turns. The power steering works well and allows for an accurate feel of the road. In the snow, this car fared pretty well. The automatic transmission shifts very abruptly but there is no noticeable loss of power over the 5-Speed version. 

<b>Maintenance:</b>
I bought this car with 40,000 miles on it, and when I got rid of it, it had 190,000 miles on it. So over the period of 150,000 miles, here is a short description of the sort of problems I had with it: The brake system master cylinder needed replacement ($200, I was told this could really be considered normal maintenance) at 120,000 miles, the cam shaft seal needed replacement ($350 or so) at 170,000 miles, and it had to have a bolt replaced on the transmission ($50) at 185,000 miles. That�s it. No engine rebuild, no new transmission, nothing else, aside from the normal maintenance. I stuck to the maintenance schedule on this car religiously and it paid off well, I would highly recommend that any other Honda owner do the same. If you do, your Honda will live for a long time. The down side to that is that Honda maintenance is notoriously expensive. 

There were 3 recalls on this car, and Honda took care of me on each of them. The distributor was replaced, the seat belts needed to have guides installed on them, and there was a transmission part that needed to be replaced. 

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this car is that it survived 2 accidents, and 3 break-ins. In the first accident, I struck a curb at about 50 mph and dove into a field (don�t ask). This did about $2000 of damage to the front drivetrain. In the second accident, a driver ran a stop sign and entered the street in front of my car, while I was going about 35 mph. The other driver was in a �80 Chevy full-size pickup. That did about $4000 worth of damage. On both occasions, the car was restored to its original condition. 

I would highly recommend this car to anyone. It is without a doubt one of the best designed and most well built cars made, AND it�s made in the USA! It served me well through my most intense years of being a led foot.
