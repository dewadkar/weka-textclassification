            The Canon Powershot S10 extends on a foundation already well established by the two previous, the A5 and A50/A50 zoom.  But also shares some of the same problems as well.  

The S10 is a 2.1 Megapixel camera (1600x1200) also capable of sizes 1024x768 and 800x600 (which is perfect for creating windows backgrounds, since most computers nowadays use those dimensions for workspace) Pictures are taken easily and quickly, and the feature somewhat disputed: holding down the trigger to view the shot to be stored instead of shooting it then deciding whether to keep it or not, is something I consider a plus.  Why store something then delete it, instead of not storing it at all?  Pictures can be taken in quick succession, which is an advantage over cameras which store on slower media.  I recommend using a CompactFlash card reader ($25) that piggy-backs onto the parallel port for much faster transfer rates, that way you can conserve battery power while the CF card transfers, all without having to unplug the printer.  Most users will be unsatisfied with the 8 Meg CF card included with the camera, I would at least upgrade to a 32 meg ($90) version if not as high as 64 megs.  Though not all people intend on taking out this camera and pushing it to its maximum capacities, a large Memory Capacity is necessary for a long vacation.  Also notable is that the included battery is insufficient; It is almost mandatory to buy the DK110 rechargable battery pack.  The Camera has a 2x zoom as well as a 4x digital zoom.  A special feature well worth mention is the ability to line up photos you take in succession.  You can place the following shot to the right, below, anywhere and splice the images with the included editing software.  It is even possible to create what is known as a Quicktime VR.  A popular file format that is allows a user to view his &quot;virtual&quot; surrounding from a point through a window.  I have seen this implemented most commonly to let a user view the interior of a car.  Using the cursor you can pan around 360ï¿½ and even zoom in on the dashboard gauges.  I believe this is an overlooked feature with a lot of potential that adds to the camera's value.  

The utter beauty of this device though is that its so portable, yet it sports the features of other high end 2 Megapixel cameras at a very reasonable price. ($590 @ www.buy.com) 

Using other Digital Cameras for recreational use is like using a Humvee as a daily driver.  A Humvee doesn't fit in a parking spot and its a chore to  NOT hit anything while driving.  So Practically you won't take your Humvee out unless you KNOW you'll encounter rough terrain.  Other digital cameras are too bulky to fit into a pocket, so you'll only take them when you KNOW you'll be taking pictures.  But what about all those times when you unexpectedly have to hop a curb, or median, or large potholes?  What about all those times you wished you had a camera to take a picture but didn't bring one because you thought you wouldn't need one.  The S10 is the solution.<br><br>
