            <i>WARNING: This is a review by someone who knows very little about cars. If you are looking for Consumer Reports style opinions and facts, I am sure that they will not make their way into this epinion. I will, however, try to give an accurate and perhaps humorous view of my day with the Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV.</i>

When you drive a 1990 Eagle Summit around, you learn to get over being envious of the BMW's and Mercedes on the road. There is even a part of you that tends to think of every person driving one to be pretentious and showy. I especially thought this of the Mercedes-Benz M-Class. I mean, it is a Mercedes SUV! There are certain types of cars you wouldn't expect Mercedes to make and for me this was one of them. I felt it was just Mercedes jumping on the bandwagon with Lexus and Lincoln to cater to the snobby clientele who also want to look &quot;rugged&quot; and &quot;adventurous.&quot;

Well, with that in mind, I will also admit that it took me all of 1/100 of a second to clamor for the keys of my friend's Mercedes-Benz M-Class when he asked for a ride to the airport and the opportunity to drive it around for a little while on my own! All my hard earned bad feelings for others driving such vehicles went out the tinted automatic window as I sat behind the wheel.

This particular Mercedes-Benz M-Class is an automatic with a 6 CD changer and a moon-roof. I'm not sure if these are standard, but they should be! It actually is the same color as the photo here on epinions. Can I tell you the greatest thing about this car? The cup holders! They are wonderful! They are on both the passenger and driver side and they actually are integrated and hold normal sized drinks. It was a nice departure from the lame box between the bucket seats of my Eagle that was a lacking attempt at a drink holder.

The Mercedes-Benz M-Class handled like a dream. The suspension was worthy of the Mercedes name. Unlike other SUVs, it didn't feel like you were driving in a truck. The transmission has something like a graduated gear system (I think that is what my friend told me) and it took a few minutes to get used to. It makes acceleration very smooth and even. The car has plenty of power (not that I was totally testing it out on the 101 or anything) and the brakes are good enough for a larger vehicle.

The layout of the instrument panel is simple and easy to navigate. I found everything I needed right away. The SUV seats five, with three in the back. Not a family wagon, but comfortable for four.

Now that I have dispensed with my car analysis, I want to go over the societal ramifications of driving a luxury vehicle. <b>People look at you when you drive a Mercedes!</b> I suppose they might want to see who it is that can afford a $50,000 car. It might have been a surprise for them to see a 20 year old with a baseball cap driving around in such a nice car. I am sure that many of them thought that I was a spoiled little brat who had a temper tantrum so mommy and daddy bought me a $50,000 toy. <i>I only wish that could be the case!</i>

I noticed that I changed a little bit. I knew that it was an ostentatious vehicle, but I was loving it! I think perhaps when you can actually afford such luxury items, they aren't as exciting for you. And you know, that is a sad loss for those people. If you are going to go for such an excess, shouldn't you enjoy it and revel in your greed? I was having more fun driving (enhanced by a public address system that my friend added to his car which I had a friend use with the animal sounds function while we drove around campus. People can be very annoyed when they see a Mercedes mooing at them!) than I have in a long time and I found myself zipping in and out of traffic and basically probably being a bit obnoxious . . . but I didn't feel bad. I had the car for one day and I felt I should enjoy it.

The Mercedes-Benz M-Class is a great SUV. Does it stack up to others like the Jeep Cheroke or the Ford Expedition? I wouldn't profess to know. Does it make you feel good to drive it? As opposed to my econo-box, heck yeah!
