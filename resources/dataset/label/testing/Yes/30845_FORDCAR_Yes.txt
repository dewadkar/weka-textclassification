            I have owned a '91 Explorer Sport for nine years.  My driving skills are very aggressive, especially off-road.  This has placed me in several awkward and embarrassing moments due to my driving.  The Explorer came through everytime, and I don't even have all-wheel drive capability.  Parts can be expensive and hard to find, but there worth it.  I have never once broke down or have experienced a component failure.  I do recommend upgrading stock tires to more aggressive tread and a K&amp;N Filtercharger for increased performance.  Explorers do need constant care and attention. If this is done,  you too may own a vehicle and still love it after 10 years. <br><br>
