            I purchased my 2003 Ranger a month ago.  The price at the time was excellent, with a combined rebate and a Ford pricing program that made my final purchase price nearly 25% off the sticker price.

The truck is a Ranger FX4 extended cab.  It has the 4.0L V6 engine, 4.10 rear end with a limited slip, and a 5 speed automatic transmission.  

One thing to note is the package changes in the Ranger for 2003.  In 2002 the Ranger had an Off-Road Package, and the FX4 package.  In 2003 the Off-Road Package disappears and was renamed the FX4, and the 2002 FX4 became the 2003 FX4 "Level II".  The 2002 FX4 and 2003 FX4 Level II packages offer the true off roader's package, with a beefier rear axle, Bilstein shocks, a manual transfer case, and a few other goodies.  However, for those who spend most of their time on pavement, the Level II is probably overkill.

Back to the truck...  I'm extremely pleased with it, however, I'll try and focus on the things that could use improvement.  You can get the glowing reviews from the brochure.

The 4.0L engine provides great power for a small truck.  207 hp, and 238lbs of torque.  That, combined with the 5spd auto will allow you to tow over 5000lbs when properly equipped.  And it'll move you along at a pretty quick pace when you're not towing.  Performance is very good.  The trade off is gas mileage.  The truck is rated at 19 on the highway, and if you've got a heavy foot, you'll be lucky to see that.  I've been getting just over 200 miles to a tank of gas, which makes for frequent gas stops if you spend extended periods on the road driving.

The interior is comfortable, and well thought out.  Knobs and gauges are in good positions, and all within easy reach.  Fit and finish is good.  The overall package is attractive.  The seats are comfortable, although they could use a little more lower back support.  Little things like cupholders on the floor, and one in the center armrest are handy.  And on the 60/40 bench seats, the center console has a fair amount of room for storing CDs, change, and other odds and ends that always seem to collect in any vehicle.

The drawback to the interior is the rear seats.  They're tiny jumpseats that fold down when needed.  And they're so small that no one but a child could reasonably be expected to use them, and even children would be uncomfortable on anything other than a short trip.  The rear doors are very handy, and make the area behind the seats much more useful for cargo, but don't mistake this for a truck with a four full doors.  This isn't a people-hauler.  It IS an effective grocery-getter though.

The sound system is adequate.  My truck is equipped with the CD/MP3 player.  It works well, and the large buttons make it easy to use while driving.  The speakers are mediocre, and the real bottleneck of the system.  They're fine for my use, and probably will be ok for most people.  Serious audiophiles will be disappointed, however.  The volume and clarity is very good, but the low end is weak.  Still, this is easily fixable in the aftermarket, and good truck sound systems are rare.  This is IS better than average.

The truck drives well, far better than I expected.  Visibility is fantastic, and the seating position is much higher than you would expect from a compact truck.  Considerably higher than the Chevy TrailBlazer I've driven, even though that's a larger vehicle.  If you like the "riding tall" feeling, this is a good option.  Handling is consistent, and the ride is good, as long as you keep in mind this is a truck, not a sports car.  It cruises well, and the cruise control holds speeds rock steady on the highway.  

Overall, I'm very happy with the truck.  It's limitations are generally shared by other small trucks, and with the exception of gas mileage, probably aren't much better in other brands.  I drove a few different trucks before purchasing the Ranger...  a Toyota Tacoma, a Chevy S-10, and a Nissan Frontier.  The Toyota and Nissan were also nice trucks (and did some things better than the Ranger), but the Ford seemed to provide the best balance of power, capacity, and driving experience.

If you need a small truck, the Ranger is an excellent way to go, and I'd recommend checking it out if you're in the market.  It's not perfect, but it's one of the best overall packages available.
