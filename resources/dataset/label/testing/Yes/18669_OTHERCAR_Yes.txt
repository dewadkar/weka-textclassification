            Took delivery 11/28/01 of a 2002 LX Redrock and paid $24,660. No extensive wait due to someone bailing on this van. (They wanted a DX) I ended up spending more than I wanted to, with the dealer padding their profit with the low trade in given for a 97 Dodge Caravan. Didn't care - good riddance to American made vehicles.  

I looked very hard at buying a 2002 Kia Sedona, which was very nice, tons of storage, nice handling and nice looking vehicle at $19,500 for the base model. Kia might have a winner on their hands with the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty but I wasn't enthused about being a guinea pig for a first year out vehicle. Also the Kia salesperson didn't seem to be too hungry about selling me a van, the Honda salesperson was first rate. The only bull he attempted was to try to convince me that everybody should follow the severe service maintenance schedule and that the Honda dealer was the only place to find 5-20 weight oil so I should get my oil changes only at Honda. 

The deciding factor was the resale value of the Honda. Edmonds TMV showing $26,660 for a 02 Honda Odyssey LX tipped the balance. The Odyssey's handling, road feel, acceleration, braking, just feel wonderful. Took about a 60 mile cruise on twisty roads and didn't get the feeling of - god, when will I get off this awful road? It takes corners better than any vehicle I've ever owned. I'm very glad that I waited for the 2002, as I wanted that five speed transmission and the 240hp engine. The five speed shifts flawlessly and very smooth. It was worth the wait. 
I've been taking it very easy on the vehicle during the break in and with the five speed it seems to be turning at about 1,600 rpm at 60mph and about 1,750 rpm at 65. First tank of gas was just shy of 26 mpg with 80/20 highway/city miles. It would be wonderful if the gas mileage gets better when it is broken in. My 96 accord only gets 26mpg! Refuel warning light does come on with 4.5 gallons left.
No strange noises heard as reported in some other forums, wind, sloshing gasoline.

My only nagging factor is the short 3 years 36,000 miles warranty offered by Honda. I guess that is how they make their money. 

Please - If anyone has anything to say about after market warranties, please share your experiences. I'm looking at 1SourceAutoWarranty or Warrantybynet. Good, Bad, Ugly?
