            This car is one of the best ive ever operated.  Its best feature is the oversized brakes, it provides a quick stop in an emergancy.  The front is very roomy with automatic seats.  It comes standard with power everything so that is not a problem.  The SE model has a slightly harder ride with its sport suspension.  It has a standard V6 so it has power when you need it, the auto shifting is reasonably smooth.  The steering wheel is extremely comfertable with grips for many positions and all differant hand sizes.  The drink holders are also smartly arranged with space for up to a 2 liter and down to a can of soda. This requires a plastic insert that can be taken in or out to fit differant bottle sizes.  The radio is extremely powerful, so no upgrade should be required.  The only bad thing i can say is that for some people the seats don't work very well, however for me i would say they are extrememly comfy.<br><br>
