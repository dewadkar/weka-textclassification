            This is one great car.

I say car because it is not an over-grown truck-like SUV.  The CR-V doesn't handle like a truck, either.  It handles well and is the perfect vehicle that combines the best parts of a mini-van, a daily-driver Honda Civic and a Winter-time SUV.  Four LARGE adults can travel very comfortably in this vehicle, with an abundance of headroom and plenty of legroom.  The 'double-jointed' folded rear seats are engineered to lay almost perfectly flat, and quite a lot of cargo can be hauled inside the vehicle in this fashion.

What impresses me most about this vehicle is how tight the vehicle feels and how everything fits together 'just so.'  The interior has been described as 'spartan' by some, but it is purpose-built.  This is NOT a luxury car.  If you want to be pampered, fork over the bucks and buy a Lexus 430 or equivalent.

The headlamps in this vehicle are fantastic.  They are still limited by the silly American specifications for relatively low-wattage bulbs, but the reflector assemblies make the most out of the light available and paint the road nicely with their output.  Ford motor company, in particular, should take note of this.

I bought this vehicle when it was about 1 year old and got a price I could not refuse.  Everything works and still works perfectly 3 years later.  Reliability is unequaled by any other vehicle I have owned.  The ONLY thing I have had to replace/repair in this car is a blown speaker in the front passenger side door. (This was blown when I purchased the vehicle and would 'rattle' at anything other than 1/4 volume...)  Even that repair was incredibly easy due to the way Honda allows you to get at the speakers without removing the door panel.

Nothing, repeat, NOTHING besides the above-mentioned speaker has had to be replaced or repaired on this vehicle other than normal wear-and-tear items such as oil, gas and tires.  This vehicle gets an 80 mile commute every day and runs like a sewing machine.

Two concerns about this vehicle:

1.  The engine suffers from 'lack of torque'.  The only factory motor available for this year CR-V is a 2.0 liter DOHC (NON-VTEC) 4 cylinder.  While the motor is certainly up for almost any task, it likes to be revved high to get into its 'power band'.  Once you get over the fact that a downshift is required to get 'er 'wound up', the rest is history.  It just takes a bit to get used to this because I typically drive V6s and V8s.

2.  When slowing this vehicle down to a stop, particularly downhill, one can feel the AWD system or the transmission doing 'something'.  It is the same feeling as when one is braking with a manual transmission vehicle and then downshifts and slides the clutch out, adding the engine's braking ability.  Somewhat hard to describe.  Mine is not the only CR-V in which I have noticed this.  Again, more of an irritant than a safety issue, but you need to be aware of this when slowing to a stop going down hill, because it feels as if suddenly the brakes start working much better.

The AM/FM/CD combination is adequate and the HVAC system is good, especially when compared with other Japanese cars.  Other nice-to-have options (some of these may not be options, but I think they are useful...) are the functional roof-rack and rear glass defroster and wiper.  There is a little picnic table that folds out from under the rear deck, and the area under where the table is stowed whilst underway can be used for a cooler.  Neat!

Towing capacity is pretty much non-existent due to the way a hitch assembly has to be attached to this vehicle.  A few folks make (very) light-duty hitchball assemblies for the CR-V, but they are best used for towing around something lightweight like a Sea-Doo or a small lawn tractor on a trailer.

My wish-list for this vehicle:
1.  V6 engine.
2.  Larger fuel tank.

And that's it!

I would definitely buy another one of these.
