            The 2000 Grand Am GT was my first car, and I love it to death.  I don�t know all about car mechanics and such, but I can give you 10 reasons why it�s a great car to own.

1)	It�s sporty.  The Grand Am isn�t so sporty that you would go off calling it a sports car, but it does have a sporty appeal, perhaps more than the Grand Prix because of it�s size.  Mine is especially sporty because of its shiny red coat.  I�m not a big fan of red cars, but the Grand Am does wear it quite well(the picture is just what my car looks like)

2)	It has a nice, smooth ride.  The Grand Am doesn�t allow you to feel every pebble you run over.  It has a nice smooth ride that will leave your passengers pleased.  It�s really fun to ride around in too.  A nice way to relax!

3)	Good value.  For it�s quality, the Grand Am is relatively well priced.  It�s very affordable, and very dependable.  You really do get a lot for your money.

4)	Very comfortable.  The interior is exceedingly comfortable, and has plenty of room.  It�s a great car for a small family due to it�s durability, and has all the bells and whistles.  There are plenty of cup holders, a nice CD player, 6 radio controls, all the standard stuff. 

5)	Great handling.  This car does what you want it to do.  End of story.

6)	Spacious storage units.  The trunk is plenty big, as are the middle console, and the glove box. The console has room to hold about 10 CDs, and can hold more than that.  Forget putting all your odds and ends on the passenger�s seat.  There is plenty of space for storage in this car!

7)	Good sound system.  Music to my ears.  Has a very nice stereo system all around. 

8)	Okay, so that�s all I can think of�but it really is a great car to own.  Very user-friendly, and great for a first time driver.  I�m sure I will have many happy years in it.

9)	The Grand Am is of course cousin to the Grand Prix, which we also have owned, and Pontiac is beginning to have a very dependable ring to it. They can really make some great automobiles. 

10)	Please, just take my word on it.  It�s a spectacular car.

Yeah, so maybe I didn�t have ten really good points, but maybe if I knew some mechanical terms I could have given you more.  Give me time!
