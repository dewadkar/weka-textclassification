            While looking for a used four wheel drive vehicle to use for skiing and other recreational activities, I was sidetracked by a 1991 Infiniti G20.  This was in 1992 and I still use this vehicle as my primary transportation.

The odometer just reached 130,000 miles and the car drives just like the day I bought it with only 18,000 miles.  Although it appears small from the outside, the interior has more than ample room for five adults.  I am 6&quot;2&quot; and have difficulty in most vehicles with &quot;headroom.&quot;  My Infiniti accommodates my lanky frame and the adjustable lumbar support seat is easy on my low back injury.  The leather interior has been subjected to some pretty rough and dirty encounters with skis but it is in top condition and still looks new.  The paint has held up remarkably well with no oxidation or any other sign of wear.

The front wheel drive, short wheel base, and low profile all contribute to a car that handles well on wet, icy, snowy, or otherwise difficult roads.  There is plenty of &quot;pep&quot; in the four cylinder, 16 valve engine, with gas mileage reaching 35 mpg on the open road and 28 mpg in the city.

I have not had any mechanical problems at all, and have only had to change the oil, put new tires on (at 80,000 miles) and a tune-up at 100,000 miles.

One flaw is the rather cheap plastic buttons that operate the power windows.  They have broken twice and needed to be replaced.  Another potential problem is a rubber &quot;boot&quot; that protects the universal joints underneath the car. These need to be checked regularly.  Mine are wearing out and will need to be replaced soon.

The Infiniti G20 is a peppy little car that has been dependable, safe, and easy to drive.  Anyone from a young person out to impress peers, to a grandfather like myself, who is in the market for a used vehicle should consider the Infiniti G20.
