            Sony DCS-F717 is the best 5-mega pixels-manual controls digital camera out here (IMHO of course)! Full stop.
I have small Konica Revio RD400, which is excellent point-and-shut 4mpixels camera. Even, after year of using it, I decided to go for more - and I found myself in trouble:). Originally, between Canon Powershot G5 and Nikon Coolpix 5400 I choose Nikon. After lots of trials I had done some stunning outdoors-shots and few amazing close-ups. But indoors focusing was nightmare. So many times camera didn't found focus at all. I came back to dealer, which was surprised, because "hey, that's Nikon". His college was holding Sony and smiling at me, saying-ha, you should choose Sony:) Those comments left me ignorant, somehow I didn&#146t want accept Sony as a fact in camera world. So, I added some money on the top, replaced Nikon for Minolta DiMAGE 7i and happily went home. This time, focus was fantastic, after having Nikon for a week or so, I was really excited. Honestly, in about hour of time, I learn almost everything about using that Minolta, without any single manual or quick start guide. Everything was very intuitive. Funny thing, in some reviews Minolta is "very complicated" digicam. I found that (relatively) complicated is Nikon. Minolta impressed me with everything. As long as I didn't download pics to my powerbook. What a disappointment was that! ALL pictures (ISO100) have been noisy at photoshop 100% zoom. I realised that my small and much cheaper Konica gave me so much clearer pictures. I need digital camera for my work too, where I'm designing monthly lifestyle magazine, and Konica was serving me well for some bits here and there (not for full page pics of course), but for that purpose, Minolta was absolutely OUT of question. Next day I was back in shop (absolutely embarrassed, like somebody who doesn't know what he wants or is just joking with sales people there; all what I wanted was quite simple - 5mpixel camera with sharp pictures and manual controls for up to ï¿½800), and bought ugly Sony DCS-F717 after almost one hour in shop testing and downloading pictures to the PC. Btw cost me less than Nikon or Minolta, which is not bad too. As an owner of Sony MiniDV camcorder DCR-TRV 25 (which was also result of replacement for JVC 367 and made me happy despite some strange aversity to Sony-probably it's difficult for me to admit that Sony is really so good in lots of!), I was delighted from the first moment. And I'm even more now. OK, not so much with controls (Minolta was winner-I will need to forget this SLR-like beauty and get used to Sony's menu system and buttons) but with- pictures. Autofocus (oh this laser holograms works!), manual focusing with readout and zoom-in, exposure, zooming thins nice 5x lenses, focusing with ring etc, everything is first class. Without many problems, my first testing shots are just what I wanted. No noise here, folks! Beautiful and crystal clear. Yes, I know is Sony, looks really odd from design point of view, but IT is ABSOLUTELY better than Nikon and Minolta (Minolta  would be perfect without that noise; Nikon would be quite impressive camera with some kind of AF assisting lamp). I'm excited and completely ready for new world of artistic digital photography, after 5000 very ordinary shots with my Konica. I don't work for Sony. I just hade nightmare with buying 5mpixels digital camera and Sony DSC-F717 solved my problems. That's winner. Next time I'm buying digital SLR. Until that time DCS-F717 will be perfect for me.
