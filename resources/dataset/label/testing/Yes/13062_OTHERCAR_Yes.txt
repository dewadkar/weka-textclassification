            I used to hate to drive, and I dreaded snow, storms and darkness - not a good thing if you live in Vermont. My 2000 Isuzu Trooper has changed all that. It goes anywhere, handles great, even in snow and ice and never gives me a bit of trouble. 

I can finally see out the window, something that has always been a problem for me in other vehicles. Even night driving doesn't bother me anymore, without the glare of oncoming headlights hitting me in the eyes I am free to come and go as I please. 

I feel safer in my trooper than in any other vehicle I've ever driven, or ridden in. It's built solid, has all the luxury and toys of an expensive car, including a superior sound system,  but the Trooper will give you the freedom to explore where no luxury car would dare tread. If you've been considering an SUV you won't go wrong with the Trooper, there is nothing I don't like about this vehicle, it is simply better than any other vehicle on the market - even the warranty is better than all other SUV's, 10 years, or 100,000 miles. I have a feeling it will go well beyond that limit. If you want a take you anywhere, handles like a dream, never a problem, don't be afraid to drive vehicle the Trooper's the one.<br><br>
