            When we decided to retire our 89 Bonnie (165k miles) and look for a new car for my wife and daughter, we determined that the 20-25K range was where we could get the most car for the monthly payment we wanted.  We drove the Chrysler Concorde, the Impala, the Olds Intrigue, and the Subaru Legacy.  Toyota and Honda don't thrill us with their stone-age exteriors, and I've never been a Ford fan.  So these were the options that we thought would give us a good sampling.  

We started with the Concorde, and it is an impressive ride.  The room is tremendous (both front and rear), the seats comfy, and the fit/finish nice.  However, to get some of the options we wanted (leather, anti-lock brakes and a CD player) we had to step up to the LXI, and that was 28K.

Then we drove the Impala.  To be honest, I had to drag my wife to see it, as she is not a fan of the tail lights.  The one we drove was an LS, with the 3800 engine, and the works for options.  It was zippy off the line, and handled beautifully in the corners and rotaries we love here in Mass.  I was impressed with the room, although nothing close to the Concorde in the rear.  

Next was the Intrigue, and although it is a pleasing car to look at, and has some nice features, the price was higher than the Impala, and the ride was not as smooth.

Last was the Legacy.  However, the dealer did not have an automatic (a necessity for us), so we drove the Outback.  The all-wheel drive was cool, but the car is still lacking in the refinements area.  It was listed for 24K, about the same as the Impala.

The long and short of it was that for the money (24K fully loaded), we could get the options we wanted, wrapped in a neat skin, and still be able to feel that we were not turning into old farts.

A nice car, with all the trimmings, and we are currently scouting the dealers for the best price.  <br><br>
