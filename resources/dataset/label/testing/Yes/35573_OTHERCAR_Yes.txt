            And Still Selling and Selling and Selling

Honda Civic Coupe DX, 2001

Twenty-seven after its appearance and over ten millions units later the Honda Civic coupe is still going strong. 

For the seventh generation of this most successful selling automobile and for the new century Honda as decided to give the Civic a new look.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Times have change and the once very popular hatchback lost its glimmer, so for 2001 consumers are left with only two options of the Civic. The choices are between the civic coupe design in the United States and the sedan with a Japanese design.

Consumers are offered three different style of the Civic coupe. The DX, the LX and the Si, the car I test drove was a DX trim so the rest of this review will concentrate on this model.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Most of the equipment in the Civic coupe DX is optional but I was very happy that the tilt steering is standard or I may never have been able to enter the car.

Once behind the steering wheel, the driver has an excellent all around vision. I was very please to se that even if the Civic coupe is a small car, Honda still equipped it with large side view mirrors. 

All the gages and the control buttons are easy to see and the controls can easily be reached from that position.

The legroom in the front cabin is excellent but the ceiling is very low, if you do not like to feel cramped in. I suggest that you look at another car. 

In the rear seat space is at a premium and if you intend to go on a long trip with average size adults in the back, you will have to make frequent leg stretching stops.

The exterior:

I like the new millennium design of the civic; it does give this car a modern appearance. 

I was surprised by the quality of the paint job on the Civic, it is equal to the same quality I have seen on car three times its cost.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Honda Civic coupe I test-drove had under the hood:
 
Engine: A 1.7-liters, 4-cylinder motor, developing 115 horsepower at 6100 RPM.
Transmission: A 5-speed manual transmission.
Brakes: Front discs and rear drums. 
Safety: Driver and front passenger airbags.
           Child safety locks.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Honda Civic coupe DX is an OK car to drive around town or to commute with. If you need a car for long road trips yes it is very economical but the comfort whether in the front or rear seats will less than desirable.
