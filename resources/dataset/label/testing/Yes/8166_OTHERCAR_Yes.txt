            Wow! That's what I said after getting out of the driver's seat for the very first time. 

I live in a city with a moderately high altitude, and can tell you that most naturally aspirated cars don not perform nearly as well as they do at sea level...but not this little rocket. The turbo keeps a high compression level in all cylinders, even if the altitude is high, so performance does not suffer one bit in the higher climes. Cruising quickly along the freeway is no sweat, and I've found it no trouble at all keeping pace with much higher displacement cars. The gear ratios are short, and nicely spaced for optimum performance.

The handling is EXCELLENT; it is composed at all times. Zooming through curvy roads is a blast, and the Quattro system has helped me avoid many accidents. Even with the Z-rated tires (my car is equipped with the Sport Package), my car has taken me to the ski hill in comfort many times. 

This car is the perfect reason not to buy an SUV. It offers all of the utility and SUV owner needs, the trunk is quite large and useable, and it has the performance to slaughter any SUV of comparable price. (I've owned current SUV's so you can trust me on this one) You get a lower center of gravity, looks, and the graceful Audi rings on the front grille. What's not to love?

The Bose sound system is excellent, better than the Bose system I have at home. The heated front seats are a definite plus, and the climate controls are very fun to use. The headlights are great, you never have to squint to see things that aren't in close proximity. 

I recently went on a cross country trip with some friends, and when I got back-seat duty, I marveled at thier comfort. They are just as comfy as those in the front quarters: nicely sculpted, and headrests are positioned perfectly. I can also say, as the owner of a 6'2'' frame, that it is quite roomy back there. The rear seats don't look inviting from the outside, but once you sit in them, you will wonder why we Americans insist that our cars must be bigger to be more comfortable.

Ahhhhh....the styling. It may just be my opinion, but the look of this car is great. It is not Ferrari-esque, but it does a great job of looking it's best. The interior is first rate; the materials used are even better than those of similar Mercedes and BMWs I test drove. Everything inside is smooth and perfectly proportioned (just as on the outside). Even the knobs on the radio and the grab-handles on the roof release and move smoothly. 

I love this car.... It is just too bad that more people aren't aware of Audi's greatness.
