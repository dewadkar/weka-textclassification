            We just bought a 1996 Hyundai Accent 4 door a few days ago. We needed a second car and didn't want to spend much money but we also needed something that we would be able to fit two carseats into. I filled out a questionaire that is supposed to list the top three cars that would be right for what you are looking for, the Accent was the first one on my results list. 
I read a few eopinions on this car first, then I read the reviews on it from Edmunds.com, all looked good. We found one with 70,000 miles on it, a bit much, but for what we wanted to spend it would have to do. 
We drove the Accent and ended up making an offer on it which was accepted. So far I love my new car! The drive is smooth, the gas mileage is fabulous! I am not sure how many miles to the gallon but I get about 400 miles per tank. I have shown this car off to all my friends and family and every single one of them has said &quot;cute car&quot; and it is cute, one of the reasons I love it. 
The car seats fit great, They fit really tight,the seatbelts worked well with them. I have only had one problem so far and it has not been with the actual car.I called my insurance agent to get insurance for this car and they quoted me a price that was higher than I pay for our Nissan. I was surprised, I had heard these cars were cheaper to insure. 
I hope I continue to have good luck with this car and that the gas mileage holds up. So far so good.<br><br>
