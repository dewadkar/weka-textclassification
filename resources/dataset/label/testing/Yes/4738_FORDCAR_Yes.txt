            I bought the Mustang GT because I have always liked it.  I love the sound of the engine as it goes.  It's nice and deep.  I especially like the sound when you downshift.  The best part about driving to me is shifting gears in a straight drive.  In an automatic, it is boring.  All you get to do is push the gas and steer.  However, in a manual, you get to shift, push the clutch, steer, and push the gas and brake.  I would not recommend this car for drivers that have just started or do not have very much experience.  The insurance is high for experienced drivers but A LOT more for inexperienced drivers.<br><br>
