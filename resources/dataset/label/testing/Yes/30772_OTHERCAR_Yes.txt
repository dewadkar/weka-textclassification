            I have been looking for an inexpensive digital camera that would take good pictures and would be easy to use.  I think that I have found what I am looking for. If anyone is just starting out and needs to be able to upload pictures to the internet or just wants to send pictures to family and friends the D-340R is a great little camera.

Easy to load with the smart card -
Easy to use just point and click
Many great features - automatic flash - different light settings - even micro pictures and auto focus

The software is included and editing is very simple.  Enlarge or reduce pictures or edit by cropping - enhancing color - and many other fine features.

Included in my package was the Flash Path floppy disk adapter which makes uploading to my computer even easier.  Great Buy and Great Camera
