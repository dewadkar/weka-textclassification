            I am a British ex-patriot, which apparently means that a car of this size is a must-have, if at all possible!!
I bought my car in 1994, and owned it for three years. It was an 'Executive Series' model, which is evidently the bottom of the line model.

The ride was probably the best I have ever experienced - probably due to the air suspension in the rear - and the road noise was pretty much non-existent. This meant that a four-hour drive did not leave one feeling drained and tired. The 4.6l engine provided plenty of power, even with a full load (the trunk is *enormous*), and the 'climate control' was outstanding - set the temperature to the desired level, and it automatically adjusts the heating/cooling as needed. The car easily seats six adults - the leg room in the back is amazing!

This seemingly great experience was marred by a succession of failures of minor parts (windscreen seal, windscreen wiper motor, passengers door lock, passengers door switch, climate control, sticking brakes, exhaust failure, etc), which added up to a large bill to fix, and a large inconvenience to boot.

The car was eventually traded in for a different model, and while I was sad to see it go because the ride was so fine, the reliability left a lot to be desired, and the residual value of older Lincoln cars is non-existent. If you do a lot of long-distance driving, though, this has got to be a great value.<br><br>
