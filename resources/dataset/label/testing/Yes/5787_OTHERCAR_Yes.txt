            This is my second adventure into the world of digital cameras. My first was a Kodak DC260 which although an excellent unit in it's time, is far surpassed by this iteration of the Olympus compact D series.

Important notice: I am not an expert in the field of photography and my wife and use this  camera mostly for candid pictures of our children. We wanted a camera that was easy to use and had an ability to take good pictures quickly. The Olympus D-490z has exceeded out needs and expectations.

Here are some details 
The integrated lens cover: This is an excellent feature. With previous cameras, both still and video I have always managed to either lose the attached lens cover or forget to put it on resulting in damage to the lens. Not a problem with this camera

Picture quality. Plenty of options here. I tend to use the high quality 1600 -1200 true color one. This lower compression does result in a larger file size. However, this option gives better resolution especially if one uses an online photo printing service and you want larger prints.

Durability: This is a solid unit. Although I would not recommend dropping it, our unit spends a lot of time bouncing around the minivan (in a carrying case) and is holding up very well. The unit also just has a solid feel.

Size: It fits nicely into a jacket pocket and does not have any extrusions than hang up on clothes when one is trying to get a quick shot.

Speed: It is very fast between shots. Flash recharge time is fast and battery life is great. It seemed like the lithium batteries that shipped with the camera would never run out. Since this is not a rechargeable battery invest in a good charger and 8 rechargeable batteries . ( The camera takes four and I have never had it die in mid shot but you never know .. .)

Flash photography: Make sure you always have it up (The flash) Indoor quality is terrible (mostly out of focus) if you needed the flash and did not have it activated. There is a warning light by the viewfinder but it is easily ignored.

Power cord: It is not supplied and I have yet to find a need for it. I have an external USB Smart media reader so do not actually download pictures directly from the camera. I highly recommend this method. (They also sell a floppy converter that you can insert the Smart media card into this also works well)

In closing this camera should satisfy the needs of most recreational photo takers the simple yet attractive design makes it a joy to use
