            My mother originally purchased this car brand new. I believe she paid $13,000 for it. I, in turn, bought it from her in 1993. I particularly liked the moon roof in it. It was a 4 door. A little too big for me. I had no children. It was just me. 

With only a 4 cyl. it wasn't a racing car but very good for students, or commuting, which is what I did for years with it. And it has a nice look to it.

It was economically cheap as far as gas goes. I never had a problem with this car. It was very dependable, very sturdy. Nothing major ever went wrong with it. I loved that car. I live by the beach and I drove the tires off of it. That is basically the only thing I had replaced the whole time I had it!!

I sold it this year with 185,000 miles on it. I sold it for only $2,000.00. With my CD player in it! I believe Honda's are the best cars made within a good price range. I now am the proud owner of a 2000 Honda Civic. <br><br>
