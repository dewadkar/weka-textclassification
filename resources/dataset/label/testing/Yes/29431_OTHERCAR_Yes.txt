            Well I'm an 18 year old that had perchased a 1990 Plymouth Laser RS. It has a DOHC 16V Turbo Charged and Intercooled engine. Now I have had on big problem with my car. I live in Ontario Canada and we get some very cold winters up here, this winter the timing belt in my car went while driving to school.Now the only reason it went was cause the time for a changed belt was coming up and the cold weather made the belt very brital.Now all Of this has cost me a lot of money but the car is very much worth it. It handles lick a high priced sports car and has the speed as well. I haven't been beaten yet. Now there are some slight mods to it but nothing major. I have no problems with sqweaks or noises. The car runs like a charm and looks awesome. It is well known around my hometown. I feel that for the price you can't go wrong. I do agree that there isn't much room for people in the back but I don't care cause I'm always driving. I think the car is very comfy and rides great.It feels awesome being in the drivers seat cause you feel as though your in a cockpit of a jet. I know lots of people that would love to have my car and they tell me this. So for all you people out there that feel Lasers are a bad car and a &quot;waste of money&quot; or perhaps a &quot;car from hell&quot;, you're totally wrong It's a great car and there is nothing that can compare to it. Maybe you just don't know how to maintain it or drive it properly without ruining it.<br><br>
