            I recently bought a 2000 Kia Sephia. I payed about $13,000 after taxes and all.  So far the car hasn't given me any problems and I take this thing with me everywhere. It handles good on sharp turns, gets good gas mileage, but the only problem that I have so far: I can't floor it and make the car move at all. If I floored it, the RPM's don't move and neither does the car, it just keeps the same speed. But it can take off pretty good and can burn the tires like crazy (i love it). 

I played a little game of chase in my car with a friend once and the car did excellent except for the speeding up part, but other than that, this is a good car.<br><br>
