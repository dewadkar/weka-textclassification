            I love this camera and I hate the software.  Let's look at the positive features first:

1.  Great resolution: 1760 x 1168 
2.  Decent 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom
3.  Pretty large sized TFT LCD at 1.8 inches
4.  8 mb Kodak picture card stores a lot of pictures

Negatives:

1.  The software is useless and makes your computer crash
2.  Flash mechanism is awkward
3.  Pictures are often chopped because they are too long or short

All in all this camera has a lot of great features.  4x6 pictures turned out great, but the 5x7 pictures started to get a little blurry.  I constantly get frustrated with the automatic flash mechanism.  It never seems to work right.

I'm still not convinced that digital cameras have come of age yet.  I still prefer the much crisper and more vibrant 35mm pictures.  The quality is still tremendously better.  I only use my digital camera for uploading pictures to my website.<br><br>
