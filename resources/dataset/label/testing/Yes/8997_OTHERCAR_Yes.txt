            I was driving my little Dodge Neon for a few years, but it just wasn't working out anymore. I now have a very tall passenger sometimes who has to scrunch up like a jack in a box, literally, to fit in, so I needed more space and height. A small Sports Utility Vehicle seemed to fit the bill. The 2000 Chevrolet Tracker and Kia Sportage were the two I looked at with that in mind.

<b> What did I discover?</b>

They both looked fun and sporty. I loved being able to sit up high and look out over the road instead of looking into car trunks. It was like riding a Jeep/minivan and very quiet, too. I discovered that the Kia had a little more space in the trunk, but the spare tire has to be unlatched and swung out of the way before lifting the door up, then it's hard to shut. The Tracker's spare tire was more conveniently placed and the door opened like a door. The Kia's spare tire also blocks your view while backing up, so you must rely on the rear-view mirrors, but which have a nice light for that.

Then I discovered how much safer the Kia is. Not only does it have 24-hour road assistance and knee air-bags on the driver's side, but also anti-lock brakes to keep from sliding in rain. I also loved the choice of power or economic shifts to help get up or down hills. There's a big difference in speed. The 4-Wheel Drive is also very handy and powerful.

<b> In Conclusion</b>

While the Tracker is more convenient for grocery shopping, it is not quite as comfortable, spacious or safe as the 2000 Kia. The advantages of the Kia outweigh its inconveniences, which are minor such as a small glove compartment, no delay on wipers and no lock on the gas tank. The mileage and price are not quite as good as the Tracker, but it's not that much better that I would risk hydroplaning or rolling over on fast curves. If you zip along like me, you'd better opt for the Kia. 2000 is definitely Kia's best year yet.
