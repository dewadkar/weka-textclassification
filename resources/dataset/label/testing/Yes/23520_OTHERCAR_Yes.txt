            The new S4 is the best performance car that comes in a sedan model. The S4 produces an outstanding 265 hp and 258 lb of torque. The S4 packs quite a punch and if you decide on the manual model it will come in a six-speed transmission. Going for about 40k this sedan can seat a family and yet still take you 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds. This is possible because of the biturbo and the V-6 engine. Audi did the right thing in choosing two small turbos versus one big turbo in this scenario. 

I recommend this car for anyone who likes sports cars with room. The car is relatively affordable and real fun to drive. The S4 is also very roomy and when sitting in the car I felt like I had ample room to shift and drive (I am about 5'11&quot;). The S4 also comes in a automatic five speed transmission if you do not want the hassle of shifting gears. Although this makes the car unable to perform at its full potential. I especially like the colors that were offered in the S4. The favorite colors of mine are the yellow and pearl blue. The interior is just as nice as the outside with sports seats that come with the exterior color of the car in the middle of the seats. The S4 also comes with some very sporty 17&quot; rims. The S4 also handles great despite of its great size. The S4 comes in a Quattro (AWD) model that accounts for its great cornering. The S4 is also nice because it can be supercharged and brought up to racing speed under a low budget because of its biturbos.

The car does not have any apparent flaws except for the body design. Audi really did not work on this part of the car. The design is pretty plain and looks like many other Audi's. The designing power all went into the Audi TT and the S4 was left with nothing. I really like a car to look good so I would buy some after market body kits and put it on the car to increase the looks. <br><br>
