            We bought an aurora as one of higher prestige than our last car.  We like the luxury of this car.  It handles very nice, we can set the seat and mirrors so my husband and I just need to touch one button to set it for whichever one of us is using it.  It is very comfortable and it drives very nice.  We put new tires on a few weeks ago and they are very expensive as they are a very rare style-wide tire.  But I feel better having the new tire on (had 48,000 miles on it), as I drive it to work and need good tires in Minnesota winters.  People who like luxury and can afford the extra cost will love this car.<br><br>
