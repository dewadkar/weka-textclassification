            The Mercury Villager is a Nissan Quest.  Why buy the Mercury?  Because it cost less.  Yes folks the Quest and the Villager were built in the same factory in Ohio.  They share the same Nissan engine and transmission (which is based on the V-6 engine from the Nissan Maxima).  But - the Villager was sold new at a better price point than the Quest.  Plus, in many areas the Mercury depreciated faster.  So the Villager could be a great used minivan bargain.

Want more good news.  I think its a better minivan than the Chrysler product (Dodge Caravan to most people).  I owned three Villagers ('93, '95, '97).  I shopped the Chrysler product before I bought each one - and later shopped the GM and Ford offerings.  In 1999 I included the Honda (the early Honda mini was too mini - too small and underpowered for our needs).  The current Honda is the best of all but good luck finding one - especially if you're on a budget.

Why better you ask?  I'll break it down by year.
'93 - If you want an adjustable front passenger seat, power drivers seat, rear heat/air, power rear windows, flip open rear door window (handy when you want into the back and you're in the garage with the door shut because you won't have room  to open the tailgate), headrest on the rear two rows of seats, anti-lock brakes, and a smooth reliable V-6 engine you better forget the Dodge.  None of these features were available in a '93 Caravan unless you find the most expensive one offered (the Town and Country).  All of these features were available on the Villager GS.  Indeed, most were standard equipment (even anti-lock brakes in '93, but only on the Villager NOT the Quest).

1995-1997 - Somewhere along the line Dodge got wise and improved its interior features to look like (you guessed it) the Villager.  But you still had to pay big bucks to get many features available on the less expensive Villager.  One feature we needed was a full power drivers seat. My wife is short, I am tall.  A seat that could be raised for her and lowered for me was important.  Only the Villager had a power seat option on the base model.  Everyone else made you buy the luxury edition with toy I didn't need. Now these features will cost less on a used minivan, but you'll still probably pay more to get them on the other brands.   

Finally a few words on the van.  The Villagers we had held up better than our neighbors' Caravans/Voyagers (and even the Town and Country).  The Villagers rode better or at least as well.  For size and power - the Villager is four inches shorter than a Grand Caravan, but 10 inches longer than the standard Caravan.  We frequently loaded ours up with seven passengers (four adults - three kids) and pulled our Jet Ski to the lake with no problem and plenty of speed for the circumstances.  Yes, we sometime put our life vests, etc. in a carryall on top of the van.  But, that was easy because all our Villagers had a standard luggage rack (optional on the Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth).

THE HOT TIP?  Find a GS Villager with the 692A package and rear heat/air. It will have most of the features  of the more expensive LS (no leather, no CD, no problem) for $1000 or so less (used price).  Many GS Villagers came quite well equipped.  If you plan light towing, there is a receiver style hitch* available made just for the Villager/Quest that works and looks great (ie. you can't see it). 

Bottom Line:  My wife opted for an SUV in 1999 and moans regularly about how she misses her Villager.  If you've been test driving used Caravans - check out the Villager.  I think you'll thank me.

*I believe Drawtight makes the hitch at about $189 (if someone is interested, the one from our last Villager is sitting on my garage floor regularly stubbing my toes.  It fits '93-98 Villagers or Quests. E-mail jwalton@niu.edu).
