            This camera is quite useful for non-professional photographers.  If you are looking for a top-line camera this is not the one for you.

The camera comes with an 8MB compact flash card.  This is sufficient for about 7 pics on high quality and about 40 on low quality.  There are also 2 intermediate settings.  

This camera has a built-in flash with 4 modes: on, off, auto, and red-eye reduction.  The auto feature senses the light levels and decides if flash is necessary.  The red-eye feature sets off a small flash before the main one in an attempt to reduce red-eye.

This camera is also capable of date stamping your photos.  The pics are in jpg format.

The camera also features a very nice 1 1/2" by 1" view screen that can be used to view your pics, preview your pics and delete at a touch before they are saved, or to substitute for the eyepiece.  The camera also has a 2x digital zoom.

Camera uses 4 AA batteries or an plug-in transformer power supply.  I recommend rechargeable batteries as the camera does eat through batteries very quickly, especially when using the view screen.

The camera comes with drivers for WIN 95, 98 and ME.  There are NO drivers for WIN 2000 or XP so I recommend an external card reader for reading the compact flash card.
