            The new Mercury Cougar has been the best car that I have ever owned.  Not only do I like the way that it looks but I also like the way that it drives.  I have taken it on several trips and one of the trips was thru some very steep mountains in West Virginia and I was impressed at how well the car handled going thru the mountains and it literally hugged the mountains like a dream.  My friends husband who lives there drove my car and he was very impressed at how it handled the mountains.  I think the car looks sharp and I have had so many compliments on the way that my car looks and how comfortable the back seats are.  I had the dealership put a spoiler on the back of my car because I do not like the looks without the spoiler on it.  I have never regretted buying this car for one moment.<br><br>
