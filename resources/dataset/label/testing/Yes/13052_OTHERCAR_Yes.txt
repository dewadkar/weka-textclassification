             I bought my Cargo van in 1997, for my delivery service. It had 12 miles on it I now 364000 miles on it. I have enjoyed my van very much but there are things that they need to upgrade. I have 6.5 diesel, I have had a lot of problems out of the injector pump. They have recently put a recall out on the injector pump. According to salesmen in 2000 the diesel engine was not available, but it should return in 2001. This is my fourth set of tires @ around 125000 per set without being on the front end rack. I get between 17 - 20 miles to a gallon on the fuel. I have replaced the fan motor for the heat and a/c three times but my blower motor is constantly going. If you have a painted bumper, the paint will soon begin to chip off. 
             On the inside of the van is very comfortable. I do spend a lot of time in my van. there is plenty of room for rest just putting the seat back and relaxing. There are a few things they need to upgrade in here to. Door panels are very weak and will crack at the top where you would rest your arm. Trim pieces are held in place by little clips and the clips break very easy if you have to remove them. With the extended  body and wheel base this makes the ride smoother. All in all I would recommend a Chevy 3500, but I would wait till the new diesel comes out to see what it is like and who makes it.
