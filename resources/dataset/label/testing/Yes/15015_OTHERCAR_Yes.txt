            Digital cameras  have taken the world by storm. If you own a computer and even in some cases just a printer you can print up,develope, and edit  your  own pictures.
I have  had about 6 different digital cameras and ended up  with the Sony
FD73. This is one camera i highly recommend.First of all its a sony, a name thats  been around for a while.
With  this particular digital camera  you just insert a  3.5 floppy disk and  then you read to take  pictures. Afterwards  you can crop, edit, delelte, make some adjustment to  your  pictures.Download them to the computer  and then your floppy is free to start  all over.
No extra cables or ports needed, or instalation of a  program just to  download pictures, Just insert your floppy which  every computer  comes  with this drive and  your  ready.
There  is  a  disk you can use if you want  that  lets  you make extra adjustments to your  downloaded pictures but its  optional.
The great thing is that you dont  need to  use extra space on your  hard drive and try to figure out how  to download.
The  camera  itself  is  simple to use, by following the  instructions its
extremely  simple to use.This camera comes with a 10x zoom  for those extreme close ups just incase that  ufo is over your house.
Personal after family outings or events, I use the floppy disk  and then either send the disk threw the mail  or   email the  pictures to family  and  friends that couldnt make it.  This  particular  sony is  so much  easier than those 8mb media cards cause  lets face it  mosty  of  us   dont  have a  media card  reader at home  so  we  have to pay  someone else to  download  the pictures....which myslef thats  what i was  trying to get away from.and  with the  floppy disk after its  full you can  go  back  look at  your  pictures   right  in the camera  and  make  adjustments,delelte......then retake  the pictures if need be.
When i bought  my  Sony I  noticed  it  was  about $500, but alot  of places have  discounts  and  rebates that can  bring your price down to around$300 which in the long   run  will be  worth it.You  might  want to  take advantage  of  sonys extended warranty to......If your  like me I drop  everything....and   for a few dollars  more they  will  insure the replacement or  repair  of your  camera  for  whatever time  you   buy.
Trust  me its  worth it.....Ive  replaced  mine  2  times  all ready  and it  only  cost  me  shipping.....(I have   butter fingers)
Thanks for  reading    and  good luck!!!!
