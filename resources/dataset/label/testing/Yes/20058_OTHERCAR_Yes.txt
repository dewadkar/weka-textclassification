            Let me start by saying I've read the other review and I don't think he really knows a thing about this car besides what it looks like. This is my first car and what a car it is! I bought this car because I thought it was a great looking car as well as a car that had potential to be great. I was in a little bit f a rush to buy a car and so after I got it inspected I bought it even though it needed some TLC. I've had it for over a year and so far I've put about six grand into it. The previous owner drove this car like an a** and when I bought it it had a few bugs. So I've replaced the exhaust($180), the water pump($450), the front brakes($150), front engine mount($200), one new front tire then again two front tires recently($250), the clutch fork and pressure plate($1000), and most recently a new head($1800)<i>(prices shown in Canadian funds)</i>, plus various oil changes and tune ups. 
     Now, the only thing that you might face of all this stuff is maybe the head the Quad Four layout (which is an in-line four and not a V4) is bad for that.  This car is very powerful (185HP) and with a cheap modification, to a K&N air filter system, has potential to beat 5.0 mustangs. On more than one occasion I raced and beat a Porsche 924. 
     The exterior of this car looks great, its clean lines accented by some fiberglass give it a sporty, yet almost import, look. The interior is roomy front and back with average leg room. The gage cluster is large and easy to read with a few dummy lights for back-up, including a shift up light for peak fuel economy. The only thing I hate about this interior is the fact that the cup holders are located inside the glove box and will not hold drinks larger than about 16oz.  
    I love this car and it is a great first car for anyone. You have power, room, fuel economy, and its a good car all around to learn on.
