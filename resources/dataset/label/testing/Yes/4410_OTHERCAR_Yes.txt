            Shortly after my husband and I were married, he joined the military.  We'd both been in college and neither of us drove what we'd consider particularly reliable vehicles, but since my husband knows a great deal about vehicle maintenance and repair, it was not a problem.  With this new lifestyle, he would be gone frequently and for extended periods of time.  It was with that mindset we decided to get me a new car.

My first step in buying a car (this was to be the first new car I'd ever bought ~ or owned for that matter) was to read Consumer Reports' Car Buying Issue.  I read that magazine cover to cover.  I knew I wanted a smaller car, and was thinking along the lines of the Geo Prism or, perhaps, a Pontiac Grand Am.  My father suggested I consider mid-size and even full size vehicles.  Full size was out of the question, but I did begin looking at the mid-size cars.  

After reading and test driving, I narrowed my search down to either the Chevy Lumina or the Pontiac Grand Prix.  I chose the Grand Prix, in part because I fell in love with the particular vehicle I test drove (I know - you're not supposed to do that!).  Anyway, we bought the Grand Prix and I've been thrilled with it every day I've had it.

The car is very roomy both in the back and front seats.  Perhaps one of the only 'down sides' to this vehicle is that there is a center console, so only 2 people can sit up front, unlike the Lumina, in which the center console flips up to reveal a small 3rd seat.  

Since we purchased this car, we have had 2 children.  I can easily fit both carseats in the backseat of the car with room in between for another child.  On occasion, we have put another adult in back, but it is a tight squeeze.  We have also been able to put 3 carseats in the back seat.  Again, it is pretty tight, but possible.

As for maintenance, we have always kept up with the scheduled maintenance in the back of the owner's manual.  My husband has done the majority of the work himself, though.  Other than that, we've had NO problems whatsoever.  

I will say my mother had an accident in the car and, despite the fact that it has been repaired (although not by the dealer ~ another story altogether), it is not the same.  The seal on the front passenger door just isn't right - and air whistles through, which can be loud and, at times, annoying.  The only other 'problem' I have with the car is that there is no trunk light.  I find this odd as well as bothersome.

We have gone on more than one lengthy road trip in this car and have found it quite comfortable for the ride.  It drives smoothly and the seats are comfortable.   There is also plenty of leg room both in front and in back.   The trunk is roomy as well and can fit a great deal of stuff inside.

Overall, this has been the best car I've ever owned.  I've had it for 4ï¿½ years now and absolutely LOVE it.  I would highly recommend a Grand Prix to anyone searching for a mid-size car.
