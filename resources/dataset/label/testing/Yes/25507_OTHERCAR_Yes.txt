                 This past summer my lease ran out on my car and being fresh out of college I decided it was time to buy a new vehicle.  Having had a bad experience with my lease helped finalize my decision to buy.  I thought it would be nice to have a truck so i went out a-hunting.  While growing up my father owned a couple of Mazda trucks and never had one problem with them and they led a hard life while under his care.  With that in mind I went to the Mazda dealership and started looking around.  Almost immediately I saw the truck that I now have.  I test drove it and while it was not a particularly powerful vehicle it rode well and had all the electronic gadgets that tend to make life so pleasant.  Included with the truck is a CD Player, Cruise Control, Manual Transmission, Power Windows and Locks,  Keyless Entry. 
   What I dislike the most about this truck is the lack of power and space.  I bought a small truck though and should have expected the space problem, also, my previous vehicle was a car.  These do not really bother me.  The only unforeseen problem is an annoying sound coming from the drivers side door.  This causes me to turn the radio up a little louder than I ought to.  That's where the CD Player comes in handy.
   Other than those problems the truck is really a pleasure to drive.  It looks good and I do believe I am happy with my purchase.  The price was reasonable and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want the unnecessary expense of a large truck but needs a vehicle to move things around.<br><br>
