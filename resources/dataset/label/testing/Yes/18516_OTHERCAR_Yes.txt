            I am the type of person who researches products to death before making my final decision.  In June 1999 I read everything I could get my hands on about the features of digital cameras and decided on the Fuji MX-600.  I have not been disappointed; in fact, I have been so happy with this camera that I have recommended it to anyone who asks.

The MX-600 is easy to operate, has a sleek design, is lightweight, and captures wonderful images.  I was a professional photographer in a past life (I guess I still am to a small degree) and the image quality has made me very happy.  The features that have pleased me the most have been the ability to control the camera's functions manually, and the optical zoom.  The display screen on the back is large enough to view an image's fine detail.  And the wonderful thing about digital cameras that you can't do with print film cameras is that you can instantly view the picture and erase it if you don't like it.  No more wasting film hoping you got the perfect shot.  And the rechargeable battery is a big money saver.

To download the images to your computer, you can use either the supplied cable or a floppy disk adapter that you can purchase separately.  I have used both, and prefer the latter for its convenience.  I already have too many things hooked up to the back of my computer, and it was hard to find a place to connect the cable.

The software that comes with the camera is useful for editing your images (remove redeye, crop, etc.).  I haven't used it much though because I have other programs that I am used to and prefer.

Two things bug me about this camera, however.  First, the camera automatically shuts itself off to save the battery after being idle for a couple minutes.  I'm not sure what the exact length of time is, but it's too short.  It's a useful feature for absent-minded folks like me, but I often raise the camera to my eye only to discover that it has turned off.  Then it takes about 15 seconds to turn on and warm up, and often by that time the moment has gone and you've lost the shot.  Secondly, there is not enough &quot;battery low&quot; warning before the camera actually goes dead.  I think the last time my battery died, it warned me about 30 seconds in advance of running out.  If it were more like my video camera, which gives you about a 30-minute warning, I would be much happier because then I would know when it needs recharging.

All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it highly.<br><br>
