            Okay you're probably like I was about 2 years ago. After seeing those goofy Saturn commercials, I was like &quot;Okay, what's the point? What the heck is a Saturn?&quot; I heard about a friend purchasing a Saturn as well, and I wasn't the least bit impressed. That all changed real quick, let me tell you.

I first purchased a Saturn in 1998 at a used car dealership near my home. It wasn't at a Saturn dealership, but at a Honda dealership. This confused me at first, as I thought that only Hondas were sold at Honda dealerships. Anyhow, the year of the Saturn was 1993. It was an SL1 model, and was dark green colored. 

I believe the purchase price was $5,600.00 and it had about 97,000+ miles on it. This may seem like a lot to you, but consider the fact that I put about 70,000 miles on it in 2 years and it still runs great. 

Sure there have been a few problems with it, as there is with almost every car. First off, the car had to have the transmission replaced 2 days after I bought it. This wasn't a problem for me though, because the dealership repaired it free of charge and provided me with a rental car until the job was finished. 

The tires on the car lasted a long time, but I'm not sure how long they had been on there when the car was purchased. I just replaced them about a week ago, and the car is again running smoothly.

One good thing I like about this car is the fact that it cannot be dented easily. I don't know how many times I have pulled up to the gas station and hit the door on one of those stupid little yellow cones that are there for no apparent reason. The first time I did that, I was thinking &quot;Okay this is going to look bad.&quot; I was surprised that there wasn't a scratch. 

I was also able to replace the radio in the car with no problems. It has a very easy to use manual, and tells you pretty much all you need to know about fixing and taking care of the car.

The gas mileage is something to smile about as well. I get 37 miles per gallon highway and about 28 street. That's a total benefit, because good gas mileage is a must these days with the gas prices so high.

The ride is smooth, and the seats comfortable as well. The instrument panel is easy to read and the car is an overall gem in my eyes.

So if you're looking for a long lasting and dependable car, try the Saturn SL1. It'd make a great first car as well. Check it out.<br><br>
