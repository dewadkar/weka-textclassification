            I picked up a Turbo 99 Beetle about a month ago. I got it used and saved $4000 over the sticker!!! It only had 13K. Do not let a dealer try and charge you over sticker. Take your business else where. Now to the car...
This car is GREAT. I think everyone buys the NB for the styling. I bought mine for the performance. Go test drive a NB turbo with a manual(like mine). You will very suprised. This thing flys! It has the same engine that is in the Audi A4. There is nothing better that having some 19 year old dork in a Celica with stickers all over it pull up next to you at a light and give you a dirty look, then leaving him in the dust! By the way, I am a 30ish Network engineer. Please don't tell my wife I have been racing teenagers! Seriously, if you are looking for an inexpensive sports car, take  a 1.8T for a test drive. Or you could wait...The are rumors that VW will be releasing a 225HP RSI version of the beetle. It would give new meaning to the words &quot;speed bump&quot;. <br><br>
