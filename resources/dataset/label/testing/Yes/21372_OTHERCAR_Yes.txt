            The Rasputan of cars! I mean that in a good way. Toyota as crafted a masterpiece line with the camry series. I own a camry solara and my mother owns a 4dr Camry, a new '99 model. But before this we had an 85 camry that ran forever. I think in it's fourteen years in service it broke down on us once. Proper maintainence to these cars really helps keep them running, but it is also the overall quality in the car that keeps them on the road. If you are buying used and are afraid of buying a lemon, look no further than the camry. You will not get dupped, these vehicles were made to last and they actually do. Gas mileage is good, ranging anywhere from 25-32 mpg. Also the seats are very comfortable and leg room in front and back is quite roomy. The only draw back is that the V6 option really isn't worth it. The four cylinder is top of the line as far as four cylinders go, and the V6 engines don't provide that much kick for those looking for the extra speed. The V6 in the camry is really for providing more towing power. Other than that it is a honey of a car.<br><br>
