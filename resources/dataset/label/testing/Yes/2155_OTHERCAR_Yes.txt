            I myself currently own an isuzu rodeo. I'm going to let you know some of the ins and outs of these SUV's. Overall the Isuzu Rodeo is an excellent SUV, if you get the LS model. Some of the plus's of this SUV are:

-- Power Windows
-- Power Door Locks (Wears out pretty quickly because all doors lock/unlock as the driver door does)
-- Power Steering
-- Good Gas Mileage (for an SUV)


Some of the minus's of this SUV are:
-- Lack of Power (Does not go up hills very well for a long distance, it has a harder time pulling itself speed wise, but overall a good engine for towing)
-- Transmission (Has a tendency to grind on gear changes)
-- Clutch (Tends to wear out quicker on the Rodeo's)
-- Power Windows (Weak Power windows, when a rain storm occurs it has a problem of getting the windows up)


Other than the few flaws and plus's it's a great vehicle.  It is one of the best for plowing through much snow while in 4wheel high. I've never seen an SUV do such a quite good job of 4wd'ing. If you were to purchase a Rodeo I would recommend the newer ones (they are supposed to be a bit more pep to them). Otherwise they are excellent vehicles, though I don't recommend for LONG LONG driving as the gas mileage isn't as great as a car, but overall pretty decent (14-15mpg city and 16-19freeway). Let me know what YOU think.<br><br>
