                British racing green with tan interior is my choice on the Jaguar. I purchased the '95 Jag in December 2002. From what I understand Ford motor co. took over Jaguars reputation of electrical problems in 1991. In 1995 Ford was in complete control of the engine and dynamics but Jaguar still gave its British touch for the interior. 1995 was the first year that they brought back the round headlights which I think gives it the exotic look. Ford has done wonders for Jaguars. Great gas mileage at about 20 mpg. The ride is extremely smooth, the shape of the car is sexy, and the interior is firm and luxurious.

   As for the cons: The back seat leg room is small. The front seats seem to be designed a bit awkward. It feels like you are sitting on top of the seat instead of in it. The buttons are placed in awkward places, as if Jaguar placed the switches after the car was designed. After thinking long and hard about the seat and switches, I came to the conclusion it wouldn't be an exotic Jaguar if it wasn't for those awkward placements. 

I have friends who have the Mercedes S 500 and E 320 and BMW 525 which is in the same league as the Jag XJ6. It is true that the Mercedes and BMW have better handling and overall better features, However Bmw and Mercedes can not compare to the looks of the Jaguar's Classic design.
