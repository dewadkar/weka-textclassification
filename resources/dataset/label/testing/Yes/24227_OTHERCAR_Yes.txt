            This is a review on the 2000 GMC Jimmy, which is going to be the last production year.  Now the GMC ENVOY will take over unless you want to move over to a Chevy Trailblazer, both sister vehicles.  When I was visiting my best friend and cousin in Florida I did a lot of riding around and driving the Jimmy.  It is my cousin's and had 12,800 miles on it at 11 months old.

<b> The SUV </b>
For a quick run through on the features of this vehicle�s equipment I will do a quick list.
-4.3 liter 190 HP / 220 pounds of Torque engine, 4 speed automatic
-Gas mileage I believe is between 18 and 27 MPG but I am not 100% sure of that fact.
-2X4 (4X4 not necessary in Florida if you are not off roading) 4 Door SLE Model 
-White on Tan interior with leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter
-Cruise control, power windows, locks, mirrors
-6 speaker AM/FM CD stereo with speed sensitive volume setting
-8 way power seats with electric lumbar on both driver and passenger side
-Dual lighted visors and dual power outlets  
-Passport III keyless entry security system
-Overhead console and digital temperature readout with compass
There is plenty of room in the front and rear even with the seats all the way back.  This is the first time I did not feel compelled to want to fight for the front seat as the vehicle is comfortable everywhere.  I am 5�10� at 160 lbs.  To give you an idea, I would think three adults could fit in the back seat comfortable on a short trip.  A Short trip would be no more than an hr or two ride.  

<b> THE RIDE AND FEEL </b>
The ride is very quiet and well noise insulated.  Even on the highway at speeds of 75-80 MPH.  The road noise is barely heard and you hardly hear the engine purr.  The pickup is strong but not enough to try to race a sports car off the line.  It is great for passing, merging, and the engine response is above adequate.  The steering is very road sensitive and its drawback is the turning radius is poor.  I have noticed poor turning radiuses in other SUVS as well.  Seats are very comfortable and supportive.  When you go over bumps the ride does not feel busy and you almost do not feel the bumps.

Overall I think it is a great SUV and handles very close to a car.  I like the high off the ground feeling as you can see all around you and there are no blind spots either.  All the windows from the rear doors back have factory tint as well to keep privacy and help keep it from baking inside from the sun.  If I decide not to go for the Pontiac Grand Prix for my next car then this, um, I mean Envoy will definitely be my next choice!  

The bonus news is that he has not had one sample defect from day one.  There are also no squeaks and rattles while going over bumps. 

Thank you for your support!
