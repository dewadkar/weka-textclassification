              I purchased a brand new Spyder Eclipse in March of 1998....Except for a starting problem on the second day (which the dealer claimed was loose wires)this car has been exceptional. I don't have the turbo model; and although my non-turbo model is fast it is definitely NOT QUICK off the line.
 My only other complaint is that it seems to wear brake pads VERY quickly. Now I know I am a tough driver but I'm talking replacement every 7,500 miles if that.
 Good on gas, very comfortable (I'm 5'8 that's important to know), great looking, great climate control system, awesome stereo, not noisy considering it's a convertible, no leaks, easy up-down of roof.. <br><br>
