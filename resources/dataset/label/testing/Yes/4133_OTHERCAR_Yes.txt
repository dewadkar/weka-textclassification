            I recently needed a used car for my wife.  I looked at quite a few but ended up with a 1988 Acura Legend.  I almost didn't buy it because it had 168,000 miles but it was in almost mint condition so I took a chance.  

This is the best car I have ever owned, new or used.  It runs perfect, looks great, handles incredibly and we just love it.  I've owned Lincolns, Cads, and even a used Mercedes.  This car really stands out.  I paid a little more for it than I would have for comparable used vehicles but it has been worth it as I feel very safe, comfortable and amazed that a car with that many miles could be such a value.

For my dollar, the Acura Legend is the best buy on a car I have ever made and is really a great car, new or used! <br><br>
