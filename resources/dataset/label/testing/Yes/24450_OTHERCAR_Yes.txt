               Let me start by saying that with the way technology is always evolving investing $700 in anything is always hard to do.  This choice is made a little easier by the many features the DSC-S50 offers.  The fact that it uses the included USB cable to transfer photos to the computer makes it very fast and easy to use.  The included software, MGI photosuite and Video Wave SE, are also very easy to use to manipulate the video and photos.  The high-resolution capabilities of this camera, 1600 X 1200 2.1 Megapixels, also means that the photos are going to look great! When taking photos in this resolution however you use a large amount of the chintzy 4 Meg memory card.  High-resolution photos can easily be 1.25-2 Megs each!  
   The fact that Sony uses the readily accessible Memory Stick makes for an easy memory upgrade.  I purchased a 128 Meg memory card for about $149.  I now never even come close to filling up the memory.  
   Another wonderful feature is the movie mode.  In low resolution you can record 60 second clips and in high resolution you are capable of 15 seconds.  It is a wonderful option and is selected by merely moving the camera switch from still to video.  It is very strait forward and user friendly.  The free moving Lcd easily allows you to position it so you can be in the photo and see what�s going on, or you can flip it around and face it inward to keep it from being scratched and also save the battery life.  Also included with this well rounded package is an M series Lithium Ion battery.  This is one of the new design "Smart batteries" that you don�t have to worry about losing it's charge quickly a year after you buy it.  
   Sony really did cover everything even including an Audio/Video cable so you can review your photos on your TV!  Be sure to shop around for this camera though.  I bought it brand new for nearly $200 less than the local retailer.  
   I use this camera in conjunction with my new HP 960 printer.  The results are truly unbelievable.  You cannot tell the difference from my prints and 8 X 10 photo reprints.  I will be writing a review on that printer shortly as well.  Please be sure to check it out.
