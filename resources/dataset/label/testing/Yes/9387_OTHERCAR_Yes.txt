            The 1999 VW Jetta is perhaps under-recognized when compared to the New Beetle.  Almost everybody would agree that the New Beetle put VW back on the map, but what they don't realize is that their are other--better--things out there.  One of these is the Jetta.

The Jetta is stylish, powerful, economical, and an all around good buy.  It offers a wide variety of accessories, engines, colors, and even two different wheel styles.  It handles unbelievably.  It even is cheaper than the New Beetle.  And most importantly, its looks will never grow old.  It isn't a passing fad that will look ridiculous in 5 or 7 years.  If you're looking for a good, reliable, fast, beautiful car, go with the Jetta!<br><br>
