            OK I bought my jeep in Sept of '02  I have wanted a grand cherokee for years.  Now I finally bought a used one which was thousands cheaper than a new one with all the same features.  I bought the laredo no fancy features 4wd power windows and locks cd players, v6 engine.  

Well, about a month after buying it my husband and I went on a weekend trip.  We left Friday night and everything was fine.  He stopped to get gas and we were back on the road about 11:00pm.  All at once everything goes out no power we were on a highway and luckily it was not too busy he was in the left hand lane we would have been s.o.l. if it had been busy he had just enough power to get into the right hand lane and then the side of the road.  Besides having a horrible time getting a towtruck.  We ended up in a hotel in some small town never getting to our destination.

There was still a warranty on the car so everything was covered.  It had something to do with some part on the computer going out.  I do not like that everything on the car went out because a part on the computer went out (1 month after I bought it) There was no warning at all just stopped.  We hitched a ride home with my parents and had to go back the following week to pick up my jeep.( a 6 hour drive)
I get scarred whenever I take it on trips.  The mechanic told me this was a fluke and this was a good car but, it is always in the back of my mind when I drive it.

Despite that I still love my car.  I guess that is praise to what a good job Jeep has done to get loyalty from the public. =O)

It is a great car for people with no kids or just 1 or 2.  because numbers are not it's strength.  But, it you just needed room for 4 people like a sedan it has alot of room.  With the extras of 4wd and more room in the back.

My best friend has a toyota 4runner I got in it and hated it I felt like I was so smushed and I was in the front passenger seat.  She went from a dodge ram 1500 quad cap to that 4runner I have no idea how she did that. And my jeep has far more room than her car!!!
