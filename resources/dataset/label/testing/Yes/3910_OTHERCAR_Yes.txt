            The 2001 Silhouette (GLS) is the second Silhouette we have owned.  Our previous 1998 model was very nice and reliable, with some very nice improvements in the 2001 model.

The ride on the highway or in town is excellent, partly due to the 16 inch tires. ('98 had 15 inch)  This van seems to sit a little higher, so visibility is very good.  

Engine is very responsive, and shows decent acceleration even at 70mph.  Excellent acceleration in the city.  While on the engine, the area under the hood is packed tight, like all cars of this generation.  HOWEVER, don't even THINK about changing your own battery, because you can't really get to it.  It is located partly under the frame, and is best changed by a dealer.

We get about 17 MPG in town, and 22 to 25 MPG highway, depending on my lead foot.

Front and side airbags.  Fogs lights.  Daytime running lights are nice, particularly in states that require lights on when it's raining.  

The rear hatch opens by a handle located on the door itself, not opened from an indoor switch as on other vans.

An interesting change on the 2001 is the easily removable, false floor that is aft of the rear bench seat.  This false floor is a storage area approximately two inches deep, with three separate compartments.  This has a lid that you can open to access these areas.  When a larger storage area is needed in the back, one can simply pull a lever on the back of the bench seat, push it forward until it latches, and as long as this false floor area is installed, the floor is perfectly flat from the tailgate, all the way to just behind the second row of captain's chairs.  Very handy.  However, we have removed this aft storage area on more than one occasion, as it allows us more storage height (about 3 to 4 inches) with it removed. (Long trips with lots of stuff)  

The middle row of captain's chairs remove easily.  They are a little awkward to remove due to bulk, but mechanically not difficult to remove.  The one thing we find sometime inconvenient, is that the cup holders for both seats in the middle row are only one seat.  So...when you remove only the seat that has the cup holders on it, there are no cupholders for that poor individual left in his/her single captain's chair...but not too big a deal if it's your mother-in-law....

Both front seats are heated toasty hot.  Have had those before on Volvos, but these are warmer and heat up quicker.  The dual temperature control for driver and passenger side is only ok.  Works but temperature difference is subtle.  Rear heat and air is wonderful.  A/C can freeze you out, even on hot days.

Stereo is great. CD/TAPE/AM/FM.  Nuff said there.  Middle row can plug into stereo as well with headphones out of ceiling jacks by heat/air controls.  Very nice for kids.

There are two electrical outlets in the center console upfront, and one in the rear by the electrical air compressor panel.  Lots of electrical sources for powering the TV's, and fuzzbusters, and coolers, etc.etc.

The traction control system (TCS) is a wonderful safety system, that can be turned off by a switch.  When this sense a wheel losing traction, power is regulated.  Pretty scientific stuff that's beyond me.  This vehicle also has ABS that functions nicely, as I've needed it once or twice during winter.

Luggage rack is strong and very useful.

The Onstar system is great.  Unlock your car for you if you lock your keys in it.  Does engine analysis.  Provides help in an emergency.  Finds car for you if it is stolen.  Concierge services, if you pay the big bucks for the upgrade.  Standard service $200/yr, concierge is approx $380/yr.

The only complaint I've had with this vehicle is highway road noise.  Our '98 Silhouette was louder than I would like on the highway, the 2001 is better.  However,I still think GM could do a little better with the internal road noise at higher speeds.  I'm not referring to engine noise, which is very quiet, but highway noise.  Perhaps different tires.............

Leather seats are well made.  Paint finish is very good.  I'd like to see a bug deflector as standard, rather than over $100, because the hood takes a beating on the highway, as the bugs can become embedded...

Having had a Chrysler Town and Country (junk), a 1998 Silhouette (better), I have to rate the 2001 as BEST.
