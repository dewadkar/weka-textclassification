            The Sony Mavica is a great idea by itself, using floppies as film, GENIUS!  And not having the time and trouble of uploading it to the computer.  A floppy as many knows, can hold 1.44MB of info, that�s about 11 High Quality Images.  And 11 5 second low quality movies, you can fit 4 15 second low quality, or one high quality 15 second movie.  The movies are crisp with good sound.  

Ease Of use:  I used it the day I got it, I just put the battery in the charger, for 2 hours and went outside, I didn�t even have to read the manual!  Everything was self explanatory for me.  I Took pictures at night in the DARK!  But with the flash it comes out EXTREMELY clear and bright!  It is a point and shoot, the viewfinder is a LCD which is clear and smooth,  visible in daylight.  You can do almost everything on the unit it's self.

Quality:  I have tried about everything someone would try, I took MANY videos, and many pictures, all are GREAT!  Pictures are bigger than the maximum resolution (of monitor) yet very clear.  I believe these are 1.6 megapixels, and if this comes out this good, I can only imagine the 3 MEGAPIXEL models!!!

Value:  I paid 773 for it, which includes tax and a 5 year warranty.  It was 599 for the unit alone, a great buy, and the fun that this camera produces is definitely worth the price.  This model (83) is the cheapest one with MPEG capabilities, there is one camera below this, and it is the 73, it has only .5 megapixels w/ no movies.  So this one is a great buy, it is not the lowest, but still very good.

Durability:  I have yet to "test" this, I have not dropped the camera, or babied it,  I only had it for 4 days, and use it non-stop, weather it is to make non-sense with friends, or for regular photography, this camera is USED!  And still strong. 

It comes with a great no memory battery.  Which means that you can recharge it even if it is only 1/2 used, no need to worry damaging it, as with Nicads.  The battery lasts over an hour, but it can be recharged for about 1.5 hours for a good charge.  They sell a high capacity one, which you can find on ebay for $55, I think that would be a smart investment for someone who wouldn't have access to a charger often.

Overall:  This camera like the title says is a perfect 10, definitely consider it as a choice, you get Sony quality with great capabilities!
How can you go wrong???
