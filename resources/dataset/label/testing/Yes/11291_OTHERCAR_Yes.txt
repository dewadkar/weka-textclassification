            This is my first car, and so far I have no major complaints and no feelings of remorse about those 5 years of finance payments I now owe to the bank.

First off, the best things: looks, handling, standard features. In Canada, the Protege5 comes standard with ABS on the 4-wheel disc brakes which to me is a better deal than the leather steering wheel and side-airbags you can get in the USA.

The Protege5 looks cool. Its only current competition is the Lexus IS Sportcross and the Kia Rio RXV which are both either much above or below the price point of the P5. I don't rate the Mazda Matrix/Pontiac Vibe in the same class because it's too bulky and even though it claims to have more power, the body is completely mismatched with the suspension and powertrain.

Handling off the lot is amazing, and the Dunlop 5000 tires more than hold their own on dry and wet (if you do significant driving in snow, definitely invest in dedicated winter tires).

Not enough power? It is relatively easy to bring the North American (FS-DE) engine to power levels comparable to the Japanese edition (FS-ZE) by getting J-spec or Mazdaspeed cams and headers + intake + a cat-back exhaust system. Apparently the difficult part is finding the Japanese ECU chip that can take advantage of the upgrades. If that sounds like too much trouble, many independent vendors are working on turbo kits for the Protege, and it is rumoured that Mazda will even come out with their own turbo'd MP3 in which case there should be a bolt-on OEM kit for the current model Proteges. That would be quite an easy way to bring the horsepower up to more 'zoom-zoom' levels.

My main gripe is that the cupholders are much too shallow to hold anything over a medium size Tim Horton's coffee without tipping over. They don't adjust to hold the cup tightly either which only makes the situation worse. Expect to either hold on to those cups, or have a stack of paper towels on hand to clean up your beverage. Also, it would be nice to have a full-size spare tire and a cargo net included from the factory.

But do not despair! The aftermarket support for Proteges is definitely growing quickly, and Mazda seems to be getting itself involved in all the right events and all the right magazines to push the Protege forward (import shows, scca racing events). When shopping for a new car this year, add the P5 to your list. At the very least, take one for a test-drive .. you'll be glad you did. Thank you Mazda for finally bringing a world-class compact car to North America.
