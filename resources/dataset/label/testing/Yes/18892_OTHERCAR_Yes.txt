            We bought our Jeep as a matter of compromise.  My husband loves big trucks, and I prefer to drive smaller cars.  Buying our Jeep Grand Cherokee satisfied both of us.  The only compromise now is who gets to drive the Jeep!  My husband likes the fact that you sit up higher in a SUV than in a passenger car, and I must agree that I have a better view of the road when driving our Jeep.  He also likes the flexibility of the back seat.  We normally have the seat up for our son and any other passengers, but we have put the seat down to carry larger items on many occasions. Although we don't use it frequently, the four wheel drive capabilities also satisfy my husband's longing to drive a truck.  Not to mention that it helps keep us safe during inclement weather or on poor roads.

I find that the Jeep drives with the same ease as a car, and it has a smoother ride than other SUVs.  In my opinion, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the nicest looking SUVs on the market.  My Jeep offers everything I like about driving a car plus the convenience of the added room.  We have surprised ourselves by how much we can actually fit into the back of the Jeep.  The only downside spacewise is that the spare tire takes up some of the cargo room.

We bought our Jeep used about three years ago, and it now has over 100,000 miles on it.  We have been pleased with its performance.  During the time we have owned our Jeep we have only needed to bring it into the shop for normal vehicle maintenance.  Our Jeep has served us well for in town errands as well as road trips.  Our biggest frustration with this vehicle probably has to do with the sound system.  We need to actually turn the knob to find radio stations since there is no seek button.  This, of course, is a minor flaw to a vehicle I would recommend without hesitation.    <br><br>
