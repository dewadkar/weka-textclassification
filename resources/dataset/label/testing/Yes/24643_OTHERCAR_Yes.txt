            When I went car shopping as a single just out of school 21 year old I was looking for something very sporty and fun to drive. The more I shopped the more I came to see that I wanted more car for my hard earned money. Upon leaving my local Pontiac dealer, I happened to spy this sporty black coupe on their import lot. To make a long story short, it was exactly what I was looking for. The 200sx was about $3000 cheaper than any of the Pontiacs I was looking at and it was loaded. They come standard with power locks, windows, and mirrors. The instrument panel was clean and easy to read. The whole dash area was well laid out and everything was easy to operate. I liked the simple dial layout of the a/c and heater controls. The circulation button for the a/c has made cooling the car down in the summer remarkably fast. My only complaint about the layout is the placement of the cup holders in front of the radio. If the cup is very big (like a 32oz with the bottom made to fit in car cup holders) the sides hit the buttons on the radio. Also if the cup is very short and you are on bumpy roads, you run the risk of splashing your drink on the radio control buttons. The car seemed so roomy. There was ample leg room in the front seat. The seats were comfortable. Looking back I would have opted for the optional arm rest between the front seats. The back seat was remarkably roomy esp. since this is a compact. sports car. As long as you are not tall, it is comfortable for a two hour trip. After owning the car for 4 years, nothing has broke or come apart in the interior (or exterior for that matter). After about three years I noticed the foam under the left side of the back of the drivers seat had compacted. The dealer replaced it under warranty (it took 3 months). The replacement has only lasted about a year and now the fabric is showing signs of wear in that spot. The interior is simple and functional. I like that it is easy to just get in and drive and not have a bunch of fancy gadgets to deal with. The floor mats have a nice little stud they hook onto so that they do not move around.

My car has a 1.6 liter 4cyl with a 5 speed. The moment I got behind the wheel, I fell in love. This is a very peppy little car. It was a dramatic difference from the Sunfire I had just test drove. It had as much pep than my -86 Firebird. You probably are not going to beat a muscle car, but it is sufficient for everyday driving. I have never had a problem passing in it either. My husband has been known to race some mustangs and Cameros in it and he beats them off the line. The acceleration is very good. The 200sx gets very good fuel economy too. My average city is 30 - 32 with 35 - 38 on the highway. I noticed a drop in fuel efficiency and overall performance at 35,000, but that was solved with the recommended maintenance (changing plugs, air filter, etc.) You should change the oxygen sensor at 60,000. Have the oil changed by a pro. It is difficult if you have to crawl under it due to the engine position. The trunk space is great as is the split back seats with trunk access.

The ride was pretty good. At 60,000 I am noticing the ride is a bit bumpier than it used to be, but new tires (Just replacing the originals) have helped some. I have not changed the shocks/struts, yet. It is not the ride of a luxury car or even a mid size sedan, but that is what I expect from a compact. It rides better that most I have been in. It holds the road well, esp. the curves. The steering is responsive without being over sensitive. I find it fun to drive. 

I have only had this to the dealer 3 times (Seat cushion, wiper mechanism recall, and flashing airbag light). Nothing was mechanical. 

In closing. I will have to say that this is not designed to be a family car. Now that I am in my mid 20s married and preparing to start a family, I realize that I have out grown my 200sx, but I still love driving it. I am not being very cooperative about purchasing a "family car"! It has been a very reliable car. I have received many compliments on it appearance wise and ride wise.
