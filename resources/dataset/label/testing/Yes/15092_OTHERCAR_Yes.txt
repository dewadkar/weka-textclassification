            The 1999 Lincoln Continental is a beautiful masterpiece of American ingenuity.  From the wood to the leather, the heated seats, the greatest blend of pure performance with a nearly god-like composition.  My mother bought this vehicle for pure luxury.  She got more than she bargained for.  I love the plush interior and the great handling.  The Continental provides the smoothest ride that you can ever possibly imagine.  A person who can afford a more expensive car with the greatest luxury on earth should buy this car.<br><br>
