            After you get past all the hype on this, that or the other sports car, you come back to the reality of "The American Sport Car".  The 1995 (C4 era) has it all, style, speed and loads of fun driving at a reasonable cost. If your in the market for a real rocket that turns heads and will keep you proud of American engineering then the Vette is for you.
Every product on the market has it's quirks but this one has very few. The LT-1 motor is a tried & true powerhouse that will challenge most anything and make you smile as you drive. You really don't need to use the power, it speaks for itself in that arena, wait until you pull up to a light and see how many punks with re-built Mustangs want to race,  but don't waste your time. Let them stew in the fact that they have a "want-to-be".   You rather have a Porsche or Ferrari?  Go ahead, after the $100,000+ sticker shock, the Corvette will still run neck & neck and years from now will hold it's head high.  The BOSE stereo is an added joy, just tune in your music, close the windows, turn on the climate control and go.....
