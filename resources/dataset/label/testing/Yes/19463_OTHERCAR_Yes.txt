            As I write this, the Sony Mavica FD-7 is going on 3 years old.  I bought mine in Florida of December 1997 when they were hard to find.  At the time, I lived in Fort Walton Beach and there wasn't one available in town.

We went to San Antonio (America's eighth largest metropolitan area) at Christmas and there were lots of ads in the Sunday paper, but none were available.  I finally found one at a camera shop.  It's an old story, but it demonstrates the supply and demand of new products.

I still have mine and it's as good as the day I bought it.  However, it's not for everyone.  Rarely have I ever seen it rated in a critic's magazine review and there are several reasons for this.

Newer technology has brought new camera features.  The FD-7 shoots at a 640x480 resolution and it's not a megapixel camera.  Therefore, in my opinion, the pictures are best suited for e-mail and web pages.  Personally, I archive my pictures on CD-ROM.  I'm not a great photo album fan nor do I have a drawer full of pictures just sitting around.

What I like best is there aren't any cables or cords to mess with.  The FD-7 works off floppy disks.  As long as you have battery power and floppies, you can take pictures to your heart's content.

One of its design flaws is its built-in flash.  I learned this from a web page I visited when I was contemplating buying the camera.  In most conditions, the flash isn't even needed, including indoors.  However, when you do need it, it is far too overpowering which causes overexposure and washout.  A quick, easy way to fix this is to put a little electrical tape over the flash unit and you can achieve acceptable results.  Another flaw is the LCD screen on the back which is difficult to use in bright outdoor sunlight.

The camera's write time to disk is about 7 seconds.  If you want to take a series of high speed exposures, this camera isn't for you.

The accessories are proprietary.  It has a special lithium battery which is made only by Sony. Last time i checked, it cost about $70.  After losing my battery charger, I'm forking out $50 and having to wait three weeks for a replacement.

The camera comes with a 10x zoom which is an improvement over its predecessor, the FD-5.  Its autofocus feature also makes photography easy for novices.

Because of the resolution, I would not recommend it for prints.  However for the average user, it can do a good job.  It also has extensive potential for real estate agents, police officers, fire investigators, webmasters, and anybody else who needs quick pics on demand.
