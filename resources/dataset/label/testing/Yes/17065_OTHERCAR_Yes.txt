            I recently ended my 3-year lease of 1997 A4 2.8 Quattro and I can honestly say that this relationship would not qualify as an ownership. It was a love affair. It's refinement, personality and silky performance compares to no other car I have owned before. (3 series BMW). If you are a skier or live in the part of the country where snow on the road becomes an issue, I don't believe that there is more surefooted and reliable car out there. (I am not talking about any Sport Utility Vehicles here) For 3 winters I have enjoyed immensely passing by four-wheel drive Suburbans deep in the snowy ditch. With heated seats and Quattro All Wheel Drive you will rule any mountain. I am not saying that there are no shortcomings with this car. 
Transmission throws are long and sloppy and headlight washers have plastic covers, which are getting lost almost constantly. But in the end with all its amenities, performance and charisma this car will win your soul.
