            The Volvo S70 may look somewhat like your father's Volvo, but once you're behind the wheel, the image quickly fades.

The short: This is a car that does not have the most radical styling, but looks ok, and drives very well.

The long:

DRIVE: This car drives very, very well. It handles turns like a sports sedan, and accelerates quite well. I drove the S70 GLT which sports a light-pressure turbo charged 5 cylinder engine. It's acceleration is more then adequate for day-to-day driving. It merges into highway traffic effortlessly, and does so very quietly. It's ride is a little stiff, but it's handling abilities more than make up for the slightly harsh ride. It takes hard turns very well, and always seems composed. It's chassis is quite stiff, and at times, you completely forget that you're driving a Volvo. The brakes are exceptional. The feel of the pedal is exceptional, and the car always comes to a quick and sure stop.

INTERIOR: The seats are very comfortable. You can drive this car all day, and not be tired of the seats. The instruments are clear and easy to read, while the dash is logically laid out. The radio can be slightly confusing at first, but once you know where the buttons are and what they do, it's easy to use as well. The sound quality is excellent.

EXTERIOR: The car still has the classic &quot;boxy&quot; shape. The front is slightly rounded off, and looks a but more muscular than the 80s Volvo's, but there is a strong resemblance to the old Volvo. Despite this fact, it is a fairly attractive car. The headlights and taillights are aesthetically pleasing. The trunk is large, and the 60/40 split seats are a very nice option.

OVERALL: This car's road manners make up for any drawbacks it may have. On a scale of 1-10, I give this car a 9.
