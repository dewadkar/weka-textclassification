            My parents have a new ford explorer.  i really like when i get to drive there vehicle every once in a while.  it has almost everything that you would want.  it has  a nice engine and very very very very very very very very very comfortable seats.  it has power almost every thing that you might be able to think of having in a ford explorer.  i would recommend this to any body that has a pretty good cash flow coming there way and if they have a pretty big size family.  there is only a few bad things.  of course as you would probably guessed that it does not get very good gas mileage.   but it is not as bad as i had thought it would have been.  <br><br>
