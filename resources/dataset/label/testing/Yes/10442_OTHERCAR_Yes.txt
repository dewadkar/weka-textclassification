            I own one of the very first models of the Acura Integra ('88).  It has many great aspects that have been improved in the newer models.  Some problems I have had:

-drains battery quickly when not in use (1 month of non-use has left my car battery dead)
-rusts very easily, especially under the trim of the door
-when parked in a public area, gets &quot;spit on&quot; about 20% of the time (I think it is usually young juveniles who do it)
-gets broken into often (once even in my own home with gate closed(happened 5/98))
-windshield wipers, (only) on slowest mode, get stuck in motion
-air condition broke down (&amp; is expensive to fix)
-springs that hold the trunk lid up no longer work
-not very good sound protection from the outside

Some things I like about my car:

-excellent braking system (I ALMOST hit 1 car)
-good control of steering (very easy to feel the road)
-very easy to get parts (because a lot of people are now upgrading to newer models and have parts to sell)
-good mileage (35 mpg)
-easy to install alarm (very inexpensive to cover the break-in areas)
-lots of head and trunk space
-back windshield wiper works excellent (makes it easier to see when it is raining) 
-car can &quot;self dry&quot; at 70 mph (due to aerodynamics)

I bought the 1988 Acura Integra LS car in May of 1997 for $3,300.  Now it is 12 years old and has 9,000 miles on it.  I bought it because it fit my budget as a college student and it was a cool looking car that would last many more years to come.  I would not advise buying this car now, but for someone with a tight budget, it fits me perfectly.  When I drive around, people look at me like I'm someone cool, even though my car is so old.  It's a car that reaching the end of it's days, I just can't see the end yet.<br><br>
