            I have looked at several digital cameras over the past few months and have found that the Sony MVC-FD88 is one excellent choice. It gives clear sharp pictures and is very easy to use. It uses a regular floppy disk, which you insert, point and shoot. After the disk is filled up or whenever you want to take the disc out to view pictures on the computer, you don't have to worry about downloading it to the computer. Also the disk can be saved and viewed over and over again, where as I have had friends who used the other type cameras and they have lost some of their pictures when their system crashed.

The only draw back with the MVC-FD88 that I have found is that you can only get 4-5 pictures per disk, which can run into  a little money over a period of time. But I do like to keep pictures and enjoy looking at them. this is one camera that I would Highly recommend, I have enjoyed it immensely. <br><br>
