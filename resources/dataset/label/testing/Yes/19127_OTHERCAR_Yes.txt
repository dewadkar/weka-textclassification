               The Passat is an excellent car for anyone who wants the flexibility of room, and an extremely smooth ride. The free oil changes, and periodic &quot;check ups&quot; have saved my bank account balance. Even the V4 Passat has glorious pick-up.
   
   This year I truly tested its space when I loaded an entire dorm room full of stuff into it and hauled it all down to North Carolina for college. We simply folded down the backseat and crammed most of my life into the car. 
   
  The Passat gives a great ride. I was informed by my roommate that my car goes over our schools speed bumps the best of any car she has been in. 
   
  For 20,000 miles or 2 years the Passat receives free oil changes and standard check ups, (tire rotation, etc). It is wonderful to take the car in and pay absolutely nothing for the service. 

  The 24 hour roadside assistance was a lifesaver when I got a flat tire late at night, all by my lonesome. I called the roadside assistance and the operators were friendly and helpful. They helped to allay my frayed nerves. The FULL SIZED SPARE made my life a lot easier that night. Instead of having to deal with the hassles of a donut tire, the roadside assistance simply installed the tire, and I was on my way. None of the  worries that go with donut tires- driving ridiculously slowly, worrying about the distances I go with it, etc.

  Passengers in my car never believe that my Passat is only a V4, because it really moves. 
      
  Overall, I would recommend this car to almost anyone. Especially, people who are looking for a safe, reliable car, which is also fun and dynamic.
