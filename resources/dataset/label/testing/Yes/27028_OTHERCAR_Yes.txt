            I have owned my D450Z for about a month now and am exceedingly pleased with it. If I wanted to save a little money, I would have gone with the Olympus D340R, but it was important to me to have the 3x optical zoom on the 450Z. I am glad I paid a little extra. After extensive research, the only other camera I was considering the Kodak 240Zoom. To its credit, the Kodak has a much simpler and easier to understand menu system, but in terms of quality and features for the price paid, I am glad I bought the Olympus. One of my key deciding factors was that the Olympus does an outstanding job of taking pictures in low light or fast action situations. A lot of my pictures have been indoor family pictures, and it has been outstanding.
Some specifics:
I like the way the camera open and closes, and I appreciate the protection it gives the lens. Some people have complained about the delay needed in closing, but it is not a big deal. I very much like its compact size.
The zoom is very smooth.
The buttons for controlling functions are NOT intuitive. You will definitely need to read the manual. After a couple weeks, though, I am very comfortable using it without needing the manual.
It is easy to get finger and nose prints on the LCD screen, but I don't think too much can be done about that. The LCD is very good, though it is a little hard to see in bright light. It seems, however, a little slow. You need to have a little patience for pictures to draw on the screen.
I have mixed feelings about the pop up flash. I really don't seem to need it too much, even indoors, but it seems as if it could have been built in. At least I am not wasting batteries on the flash without definitely choosing to use it.
As for the batteries: it uses 4AA. Immediately buy the MAHA CF-204-F recharger kit with 4 NiMH AA batteries from Thomas Distributing. (Use this link: http://www.shortcourses.com/catalogs/batteries.htm and click on the Buy Now and save a couple bucks.) I have taken about 50 or so pictures at least, about 1/4 of them with the flash, I have offloaded pictures to my computer a couple times, and I have been using the LCD a lot to show off my camera and pictures to friends... and I still am on my initially charged set of batteries with very little loss indicated on the battery charger.
As for getting pictures out of the camera: it is fun to hook the camera directly up to a TV or VCR and show pictures on screen. To get pictures into my computer, the included serial cable works fine, but it is a little slow. I did buy a FlashPath adapter (the cheapest ones I found were at Onsale/Egghead: just type flashpath in the search box), and it's easier to use and perhaps a bit faster.
Software: the enclosed Camedia software is fine, but I prefer to simply use Windows Explorer when I use either the serial cable (go down to find the My Digital Camera 'directory) or the FlashPath (just view the A: drive). The software included to stitch together panorama shots is a great idea, but I have not found it to be very successful. (I have not used a tripod which would probably help matters a lot. BTW, if you buy Olympus brand SmartMedia cameras, the camera has a great viewing feature to help you set up panorama shots.) The Adobe PhotoDeluxe is outstanding software.
Finally and perhaps most importantly, the picture quality is excellent. I usually just set it on the HQ setting which gives me about 36 pictures on the included 8Mb SmartMedia card. (Buy another card for more photos!) I have needed to do some adjustments in PhotoDeluxe and tweaked my printer settings a bit (HP 880C), but photos printed on plain paper are quite good, and ones printed on photo paper are outstanding. One uncompressed TIF picture I took (another nice feature this camera offers) came out especially well.
Prices on this camera seemed to have floated up and down quite a bit in late Nov/early Dec of 1999. I ended up buying from Computers4Sure and received excellent service and delivery.

March 31, 2000 Update:
Recently returned from a 9 day trip to El Salvador using this camera, and I am even more pleased! The charged set of Lithium batteries lasted for at least 350 pictures and extensive use of viewing them on the LCD. Being able to delete those lousy shots is great. It is also a nice conversation starter by showing the picture you've taken to the person/s who might be part of it. Low light settings, where a regular camera would not have had a chance with a flash, turned out especially well.
