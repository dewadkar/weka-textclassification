            For my birthday, my dad got me a 97 Mustang for a first car. It's a 5 speed manual, cloth interiour, and a little customising. I'm the second owner and the car is still in excellent condition. There are a few problems with it though. The plastic door panels squek, and there are some other nioses in back. I have learned to ignore them. The car has great excelleration, and even better handling. I have taken off ramps at 50 and 55 miles per hour. I haven't raced onyone yet, there's the catching word. &quot;Yet!&quot; I would recommend this car to anyone that likes speed, handling, and a chick magnet! Chicks dig the ride! <br><br>
