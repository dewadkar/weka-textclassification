            Having just returned from the local dealership, I write with a near present sense impression of the car.

Let's face it, you are looking at the Marauder because of its intrinsic ability to frighten onlookers.  Or maybe that's just me...

Black paint, black bumpers, blacked out lights, blacked out grill, dark mono-chromatic interior colors...  Mercury is stretching to free itself of the Grandpa image of the Grand Marquis, and this is a step in the right direction.  While not perfect by any means, I look forward to augmentations and variations on this theme.  

<B>THE DRIVE.<B>  The dealer tossed me the keys practically before I got out of my car; he saw me coming.  After sinking into the front seats (they are very well padded), I immediately rolled down the windows; I wanted to hear the voice.  While I am no fan of those punks who augment exhaust on Jap pocket rockets, I wanted to hear a true throaty V8.  I was satisfied.  Not a loud Cobra growl, nor the absent purr of a Crown Vic, Marauder gave a dignified but charging growl.  I gave her a thorough sprinting.  0 to 75 in a short jaunt.  You can actually feel the high stall torque converter kicking in.  However, this is no sports car.  Given the size, she moves well enough.  I expected more.  But maybe because I hear of Mercury's plan to bolt a charger under the hood for the '04 model.  The should give it plenty of torque.  The steering was tight, very precise, and right on.  The steering wheel is shared with the '03 Towncar.  The 4 disc breaks (giants in the front) provide very good, and very controlled braking.

<B>THE INTERIOR.<B>  The few differences a blind man would find between the cabin of Marauder and the Grand Marquee would be front buckets, extra gauges,  and a floor shifter.  The sighted will find a very different look... slate or charcoal interiors only, carbon-fiber/ aluminum looks, and performance gauges add to the cars aggressive stance.  I liked the cushy seats, but sports enthusiasts will not.  They are bucket seats, but very pillowy ones.  

Overall, This is a pretty good concept.  Is it worth the money?  Well, for the same money, you might find a 2 year old Jaguar S-Type 4.0, with much better performance, looks, and elegance.  However, if you want to own a car that looks like a muscle-bound secret service agent, this is the one.
