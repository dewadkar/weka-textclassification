                  I have a 2001 Nissan Altima GXE(limited edition). Really not a big difference between the limited edition GXE and the usual GXE except for the power seats. The car is a real good deal for the money and the power from that 4 cylinder engine is unbelievable. So far not even a trace of trouble spotted and still in the crisp condition as new.
          Considering handling, it handles the curves and ramps in a pretty easy way and the centrifugal force is much reduced compared with other cars. It is roomy and the leg and head space is plenty. The only thing I am not satisfied is the seat comfort. Certainly not enough. Brakes are real powerful, power steering is very light, and more than all of this the gas mileage is outstanding. Without A/C I get about 36-38 in Highways and 33-35 in City.       
         It has a CD player and there is not much to say about it. Sounds good but not upto the mark for music lovers. I would definitely replace the sound system.
        I wanted a car that would last even after 10 years and I am sure I've picked up the right car somehow. Not much negative aspects about the car, so I would recommend this car to any one.
