            I knew I needed a good camera when my daughter was born, and I knew a digital was the way to go (children are not cooperative, and film is not cheap). I am anything but handy with a camera, so I needed something that was easy to use and not too expensive, but capable of taking a picture that would survive being printed to photo paper. After a bit of research, the Canon S110 won out over competitors based on the megapixel count (which determines the quality when printed), the size (it fits into my pocket, so that I don't mind carrying it around) and the price (middle of the range, but cheaper than a lot of comparably equipped cameras).

<b>Ease of use</b>
As I mentioned, I am not photographically advanced, so I wanted to be able to point and shoot, and not have to worry about lots of settings. I have never had a problem with the focal length, and although colors often don't seem quite right (sometimes too red), that could be more a function of my vision than anything else.

Downloading the pictures to the computer is pretty straightforward, though I have recently had problems with the photo software provided with the camera--I have several hundred pictures saved on the computer, but for some reason each time I load the software to download more pictures, it requires me to reregister the photo directory, which takes quite a long time (20+ minutes lately, though on an older computer). However, aside from this the software is fairly intuitive and has some nice features, many of which I find useful but lack the time to fully explore. 

<b>Memory</b>
As I found out, however, the 8MB card provided with the camera is way too small. Because I want to have the option of printing most of my shots, I take relatively high resolution photos, which obviously require more memory. The provided card only holds 7 images, making a larger card mandatory. I opted for the 128MB card, which is now only $50 or so. Still, I don't understand why the provided card isn't larger.

<b>Battery life</B>
I have had no problems with battery life--I took the camera with me on vacation recently and had no problems, never needed a charge. Besides, the provided charger is small enough to pack in a suitcase for a multi-day trip.

<b>Size</B>
I hate being burdened by bulky pockets, especially when they contain breakable items, so I was relieved that the S110 fits into my shirt pocket without being intrusive, making me much more inclined to take it with me. 

Incidentally, yahoo provides an excellent digital photo sharing service, and has links to Shutterfly, which provides very nice photo finishing services. (unpaid service announcement).

I have already recommended the same camera to a number of friends. Though not professional quality, it is solid and good enough for casual use--after all I entrusted those precious pictures of my daughter's infancy to it.
