            Why did I get a Saturn?
  I wanted that car that would get good gas mileage, be comfortable for trips, and not kill me with repair costs. 
What did I get?
  I got what I wanted, but I also got some problems.  The car I bought was fully loaded, that means it had CD, Sunroof, electric everything, maybe a little too much for Saturn to handle.  So far I've had some problems with the sunroof getting jammed and then only sometimes works.  This goes the same for the left electric windows. All the same its not hard looking for things that I like about my Saturn.  I love the way it drives.  This includes cornering, braking(although it could have ABS, which it doesn't), cruising... Its a fun car, especially because its a manual transmission.  Its also a beauty.  There are some cars that I'd really get tired of, but that doesn't happen with my Saturn.  

This car would really work for you if you are a commuter, in any respect.  Definitely a good car for a student(that comes straight from one), and someone not to troubled with the chocolate coating(that would be the electrical/mechanical additions)

If you are someone looking for the perfect car, the most safe car, or a high performance racing car I would look at something else.  I do admit it would be more comforting if it had ABS, but it does have dual airbag.
