            Before I bought my Saturn SL1, I was considering purchasing a Dodge Neon.  I was currently driving a 1991 Geo Tracker &lt;an absolute LEMON, but that's another story&gt;, and the transmission and suspension was going out.  So I went to the Dodge dealer.  There, we stated up front what we could pay and what we knew my Tracker was worth &lt;sans the transmission and suspension trouble&gt;.  Well, in a nutshell, they tried to have me pay an ungodly amount, and tried to give me next to nothing for my jeep.  So, after seeing the luck my boyfriend's father had had with his Saturn, I decided to check it out.  When we got there, we were immediately approached by a sales person.  She was the ABSOLUTE NICEST!  No pressure or anything.  She asked what I wanted, and if I had a specific color in mind.  Not only did they have it on the lot, they were able to get my payments to something I could afford.  Also, they took the time to actually look over my jeep before they gave told me what they'd pay.  It was the same as the Dodge dealership, but unlike Dodge, Saturn had a valid reasoning for the amount.  I drove it off the lot that day.  I am happy to say that I have been the proud owner of a Blackberry colored 2000 Saturn SL1.  Let me tell you, I will never buy another car.  Saturn was helpful and caring.  My car is the easiest thing to drive, and I love it!<br><br>
