            Solid!  If there was one word that could be used to describe the Mercedes Benz E320, that would be it - solid.  Heck, the thing even looks solid, as if its entire structure was chiseled from one solid slab of granite, albeit a nice shiny metallic slab of granite, rolling on tastefully understated wheels, up-and-over door handles, and of course the three pointed star hood ornament, just to let the driver know they're driving a better slab of granite than everyone else.  

Solid (there's that word again) performance comes courtesy of a 3.2 liter straight six engine, shifting the 1550 kg mass of the Merc from rest to 100 km/h in a brisk, if not totally exciting, 8.5 seconds.

Slightly pricey for what, at the end of the day, is still a 4 door family sedan, the E320 is still never-the-less an extremely competent car, and certainly up to Mercedes' usual high standards.  4 stars.<br><br>
