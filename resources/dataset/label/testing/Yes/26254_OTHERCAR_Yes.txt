            I have purchased a brand new Honda Civic EX Coupe 3 weeks ago, so I might be a rookie writing epinion on it already but at least I would try...

Last month I decided that it's about time I get a new car (always wanted one, never had an opportunity to get it). So I went to the local Don Jacobs dealership (Volkswagens and Hondas).. and test drove 2 cars: Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic EX Coupe. I loved both. Volkswagen seemed to be more sophisticated with all this wonderful stereo, digital mile numbers, big wheels and other great features. However, I loved Civic's shapes and sunroof. I liked both so much that it took me a long time to decide which one I should go for. Finally, I went along the financing lines (Volkswagen was more expensive to finance in the long run, monthly payments were greater, and the APR as well was greater than Honda's)..and decided to get Honda.

Here is what I like about my car so far:

* adjustable seats and the steering wheel (there is 2 point adjustment mechanism for the driver seat, and the steering wheel could go up or down)
I readjust it every week differently and it feels like you are driving a totally different car every time 

* cruise control.. I tried it just once a week ago while driving around 30 miles to a nearby city.. it was pretty kewl

* gas economy here are the numbers:
   206 miles on 6.5 gallons (mix driving on interstate &amp; city)
   150 miles on 4.5 (or so) gallons (on interstate)
   180 miles on 6.5 gallons (in the city)

* the tank is approximately 8 - 9 gallons

* nice lights right above the mirror

* relatively big pockets, and storage area at front

* 40 / 60 seats

* car drives very smooth

* lights are very bright... 

* keyless entry / powerlocks / sunroof

* beautiful shape and color (mine is Silver)

* anti theft for CD



            What I don't like about my car:

* STEREO is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY WEAK (it's 6 speaker stereo) (I am a loud music freak..)

* Seats are not very comfortable (rather narrow, and crampy at the back)

* Trunk is not big

* There is no trunk opening button on the remote control

* Seats are made of a cheap grey material (VERY VERY EASY TO WEAR OUT I can tell right now) (the EX models I was looking at all came with the same interior, so I didn't have any choice really..however I would prefer some other seat's cloth like light grey or cream)

* The mileage number is not displayed digitally...



Overall:

so far I am content with my car, of course there are times when I tell myself: why didn't I go for the volkswagen...but it happens rarely...
I would definitely recommend this to some young person. I think this car is a bit feminine...Also, this is a perfect second car. However, I would not recommend this car for families with little kids or big families. 
Perfect for student or singles.. It can look both sporty and conservative. This car is fun to drive...
