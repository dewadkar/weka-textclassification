            It's funny that one of the marketing slants on this car has been &quot;Based on alien technology&quot;. And as hokey as it sounds, it's probably not far from truth. (grin) From the exterior design and style that has made you rubberneck a few times as they whizzed by, to the ergonomics and sleek interior. Much thought went into this car. It's Volkswagen's offering of performance meets efficiency made accessible to the masses.

The GLX Turbo is quite simply AWESOME! IF you have the means, and are looking for performance then go ahead and try the five speed manual.  Handling is very nice in cornering and an extra feature is the ASR(Anti-Slip Regulation)for control in rain or any street conditions. This car really lets you get in touch with the driving experience and makes it a blast! The 1.8L Turbo offers great response in passing and very well out of 2nd and 3rd. A cool optional touch on the GLX Turbos reminiscent of the Corrados (for the VW devotees) is the mini-spoiler that activates on or above 90mph (but with a manual override as well so you can play). Four speed drivers note: Gears are a &quot;little taller&quot; - so this car likes to be wound out. And it will make you smile big when doing so..  

Its great fun to drive by yourself - or with friends. Although the back seat is not that roomy (its a trade off) there is great hauling space in the trunk. And NB prospective family members should also make note that on models with a moon roof - there is some wind vibration and noise if you do not open the moon roof to its ideal position.

Another noteworthy point; Upon arriving at my dealer, I was surprised to find a couple of models on the lot in both &quot;reflex yellow&quot;, and &quot;vapor&quot;. The advertised &quot;web-only available&quot; colors.. So contact as many dealers as you have in your area - you never know and it could mean getting that &quot;hard to get&quot; shade. I was in love with the metallic silver myself - but thats the beauty of it. They look great in all colors! And I'm really pleased with getting this car loaded. Moonroof, turbo, full leather all add to the experience but in short - this car spells great fun no matter WHAT package you get..

My wife and I are now constantly fighting to drive ours so we're heading back to buy another ASAP. If that's not a singing endorsement.. 
Very well done VW! Kudos!
