            In order to understand the beauty of this vehicle, one must only look at the pure facts:

1. Its 350-cubic-inch engine, packing 350-405 horsepower (depending on the model), not only makes great power and torque, but also gets excellent gas mileage.  On a freeway, with the 6-speed manual, expect close to 30 MPG!!

2. Its front-engine, rear-transaxle design makes for perfect weight balance throughout the car, which equals beautiful handling and great acceleration.

3. Its Active Handling and Traction Control Systems help keep the reins in on this pony, without compromising the sporty feel AT ALL!

Simply put, this car is great.  It is the only car under $50,000 that can perform very close with the $200,000+ exotics.  Its also more reliable than its Italian and German counterparts, and parts, both aftermarket and from the factory, are easier to find.
