            Pontiacs '97 Sunfire with a 2.4 liter engine is the engine of choice. Believe me I know, I rented a Sunfire while in Florida with the smaller engine and I could tell a major difference in power. I missed my '97 sunfire in comparison. 
The drawback and I know this is a common problem with sunfires, the gas cap situation. The gas cap must be tight so the engine light won't turn on. It is an annoyance. Also, I live in a cold winter and the engine light turns on when the weather is below 40. Other than that, no complaints. My vehicle has about 48000 miles and seems to run just fine.
