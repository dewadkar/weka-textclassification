<TEXT>
            All last week I was driving around in a 2000 buick Regal LS. I had it as a rental car while my 300M was in the body shop (I was rear-ended). Though the GS is supercharged, the LS's 3800 series II V6 (3.8L)had plenty of power!! Everything about the car is kinda borring, besides the engine, becuase its all the standard GM fair controls. It rode excellently, and had a great sound system, but yet it just seems too bland. And even with great acleration it didn't have what it needed to impress me. its back seat was much more cramped thyen my 300M, yet overall legnth is very close. Also in this car it is hard to see the front and back because of the design of the car. 
It holds true to the buick tradition, it looks old!! Or atleast like someone old should be driving it. Any way it was a fine car for a week, but man was I happy to get my 300M back!!!<br><br>
