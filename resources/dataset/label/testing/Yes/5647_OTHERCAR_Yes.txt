                WOW!!! What a car. I just bought one about four and a half months ago. I have owned fast expensive cars throughout the past 10 years. I had a 1992 Jaguar XJS, a 1994 Toyota Supra twin turbo w/ 320 horsepower, and a 1990 M3. These cars cost me a little more and a little less than what I paid for my M Coupe.

    Ever since the first time I saw this car in Road &amp; Track about 2 years ago as a prototype, I have loved its stylish design and  powerful BMW M engine. This car offers a little more trunk space than the Roadster model. I can now hold 2 large golf bags in the trunk. The car rides like any other BMW: SMOOTH! 

    This car has exceptional handling and shocks, which keep rides around a busy city or out on the open highway smooth. If you can spare 44,000 dollars for this car BUY IT. If I was in BMW's business department I would make sure this car would not go for under 75 grand. This car is worth every penny.<br><br>
