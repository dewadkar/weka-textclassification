            I've had my HP850 since before Christmas. I find it takes very nice pictures for what it is ( 4 meg pixel ). It is very important to either use a tripod or other way to stablize yourself if you use very much zoom. Or you get blured pictures. But that is common knowledge to experienced camera users.

The 16 meg SD card that comes with the camera is too small for very many pics. I now have the 16 and 3- 128 meg cards.
I understand it can use 256 meg cards.

The 8X optical zoom on a 4 meg camera was what sold me. The only thing close to it at the time was the Olympus 730 ( 3 meg w/ 10x zoom ).  I was willing to give up zoom for more resolution for the same price (MSRP).

I have taken over 600 pics so far and very few needed to be deleted.Even images zoomed to the 8x optical x the 7x digital looked decent.

I haven't bothered using the low resolution setting ( ~1meg/pix ) . The 4 is better even if large in size.

The 1.8"  display is nice,  though the eye piece is less battery eating. And it has a diopter adjustment so you can adjust for less than perfect eye sight.
The eye piece also, turns on only when you are close to it. Again saving batteies.

Go out and get Metal Nickel Hydrite batteries and a charger. Or buy stock in a battery company because it will eat other types fast. Fortunatly it uses standard AA size cells.

I recommend getting a card reader to download as the HP software to download is buggie. 

I also recommend going to HPs' site and ordering the 3 year damage toolkit. It is next day replacement evn if you damage it. Far better than store protection plans.
