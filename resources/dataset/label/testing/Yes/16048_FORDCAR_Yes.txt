            I'm 16 years old I didn't know much about cars, my mothers friend brother-in law was selling a escort. I went down to check it  out, ran ok, looked decent only had 50,000 miles, so i was like ok, so i bought it(500$.)About a week later i started to notice that the car was hesitating and shaking a little bit on turns. So i gave a little tune up replaced the air filter and couple minor things, the car seemed fine after that, a couple more days later it was doing the same hesitating/shaking thing. So I Talked to my dad and we decided to take it down to a mechanic to get it looked at, At first the guy though it was this oxygen thing, but then he looked at the Trany and noticed that it was kinda shot.  So he said he could put a used one in for 500$, so i was like sure why not, i mean i only paid for 500$ for the car, so if i have to put money into it, its still not a bad deal, the guy ended up putting a transmission in that had no reverse, so he got another onefrom Mass. Put that in, got my car back a week ago, running absulty fine. he said i needed new brakes in 10, 000 miles, which isn't to bad, so what i am trying to say is the escort is nice car to buy, if your just starting out. Even if your not just starting out, its still an great buy, i would not recommend buying a new ford, heard to many bad things about those, well i hope i helped someone out there!
