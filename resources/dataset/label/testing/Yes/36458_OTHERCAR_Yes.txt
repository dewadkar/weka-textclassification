            I've been a big fan of Nissan cars, ever since the 300ZX and then the beefy 222HP Maxima.  Until now, I haven't yet found a car sporty enough, at an affordable price.

So here comes Nissan, with a 4-door car that has ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING you could ask for in a non-luxury car.  In comparison to a Honda Accord, or Toyota Camry, the 2002 Altima is by far the better car in every aspect.

I got the Sheer Silver 3.5SE manual with sunroof and spoiler.  I got mine for about $23,000 thanks to a corporate discount program with the company I work for.  I've always preferred the stickshift, but honestly, the automatic is just as nice to drive.

-A lot of legroom and headroom
-16/17" standard alloy rims (17" on the 3.5se)
-240HP on the 3.5se model
-digital trip/odometer/MPG(miles per gallon)/DTE(distance to empty)
-telescopic steering wheel in addition to tilt steering
-center compartment is ingeniously designed (go see it for yourself)
-the trunk is HUGE, seriously
-the standard 6 speaker sound system is top notch
-front windows have one touch up & down capability
-remote also has one touch down capability for front windows

There's plenty of other features to mention, but these are just my favorites.

Here are my nit picks, however, no reason not to buy the car:

- vanity mirrors are at an angle, so you only see half your face, however, you can unhinge the visor to fix it (just annoying)
- the shifter is not sporty enough (too long)
- the steering wheel stereo controls get in my way
- the sunroof windguard vibrates at certain speeds when open (maybe mine is just flawed)

That's about it though, the car is fast, and very nimble. I think the only thing missing from this car is the GPS and homelink only found on the Maxima.  If you've always wanted a low profile sports car without all the attention, this would be it!
