            The Volvo wagon is a great car overall, with only a few shortcomings. It handles very well and runs quietly. The angle of the back of the car allows more storage, as it is more vertical than other wagons. The seats are easy to adjust and put down for additional storage. The great thing about this car is that it is roomy. The front seat is more spacious than others I tried, and I am only 5'-9&quot;. It is also wider than others, so during the winter months the bulk of the winter coats isn't too binding. 

As for the negatives about this car. The drink holders in this model are limited. Just two in the center arm rest up front. They are relatively delicate too. Mine broke, but was replaced for free. They are small too, so they fit only for cans or skinny water bottles. The back seat holders are much better. 

The car completely lacks CD storage, which is strange since a CD player is standard. There is limited tape storage, but it is beneath the drink holders, so the drinks have to be removed to open that area. 

The window frames of the back seat doors are pretty thick, such that the blind spot check is a bit trickier than other cars. It's just more difficult to see behind on the drivers side.

That's about it, but interior amenities aside, the car is great.<br><br>
