            Toyota has finally arrived as a contender in the large truck market.  The Toyota Tundra with its big V8 engine can compete with any large truck on the market today.  Being a satisfy Toyota owner (Toyota  4WD, 4 cylinder) since 1993, the first place I looked for a new truck was at my local Toyota dealership.  Here is my review of the Toyota Tundra at the dealership.

EXTERIOR
The basic Toyota style extended cap pick up.  Large head lights,  small tail lights,  running boards, bed rail and cover.  A really nice looking truck that comes in a variety of colors.

INTERIOR
Two large front seat and a center console with air, heat, CD - FM-AM - Cassette and very nice interior lighting.  The cup holder no longer blocks the stereo compartment when in use.  A lot of leg room and adjustable seats.  The back seat may not be as comfortable because it sits on top on the storage area.  However, it may be good for small children.

UNDER THE HOOD
All the fluid such as oil, power steering,  coolant, etc, are color coded and within easy reach.  Besides the big powerful V8 engine there is still a lot of room under the hood.  There is a one belt system that turns the fan, alternator, power steering, etc.  The oil filter is easy to get to as well as the battery.

THE TEST DRIVE
An automatic transmission make it easy for anyone to drive.  A nice quiet comfortable ride with a lots of power.  May take time getting use to this V8 engine.  Steering is easy as well as parking.  Handle the city traffic real well and extremely easy on the highway.

Overall, its a good truck to buy.<br><br>
