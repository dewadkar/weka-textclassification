            I recently rented a 2002 Focus SE automatic for three days, driving it approximately 300 miles on a variety of city and highway roads. Ever since the Focus's launch, I've heard great things about its great balance of economy and driving dynamics, and it was a pleasure to discover that these great things are (mostly) true...

<b>The Driving Experience</b>

Ideally, I would have driven a Focus with the Zetec engine (130 horses, 135 lb/ft torque, 16 valves, state-of-the-art lightweight design) and five speed manual transmission. Nevertheless I was impressed with the automatic SOHC (110 horses, 125 lb/ft torque, 8 valves, a much older design) model I drove. I should mention that the Zetec engine is available as standard or as an option on almost any configuration of Focus sedan, hatchback or wagon.

Acceleration for the SOHC model is not exactly breathtaking (just over 10 seconds from 0-60, I think), and fuel economy is apparently slightly better with the Zetec engine, but my Focus never had trouble keeping up with traffic, pulling on to on-ramps, or any other aspects of daily driving. While the SOHC engine is an older design, the well insulated cabin and smooth gearchanges from the four-speed automatic create an overall impression of refinement. Push it hard, though, and you'll be rewarded with lots more noise without too much in the way of actual performance. If I were to purchase a Focus, and if everything I've read elsewhere about this vehicle is true, I wouldn't hesitate to pick the Zetec.

Leaving aside the merits of engine choice, what's particularly impressive about the Focus -- and in my mind the main reason I'd recommend this vehicle -- is its handling and ride. The Focus's power steering is extremely well weighted (for me, this translates as not too light and with a feel of precise communication with the road) and there is a real sense that the car goes exactly where it's pointed. Turn-in is tight with barely a hint of understeer, and body roll is minimal. Throw the Focus into some challenging bends and it responds without protest. The ride is extremely composed, with even the worst pothole-ridden streets easily traversed without the suspension crashing and banging. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the Focus is one of the best handling cars I've driven in a long time.

When compared to a Chevrolet Cavalier / Pontiac Sunfire (without doubt the most irredeemably awful cars I have ever driven), the Focus is a revelation, proof that domestic auto manufacturers really can produce cheap cars that are economical and good to drive. OK, so the Focus was entirely designed in Europe, but at least Ford had the courage to trust that North American buyers would appreciate it. Perhaps more relevant is the extent to which the overall driving experience of the Focus is far superior to the VW Golf, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic and many of its other imported competitors. The Golf is considerably poorer in the handling department (too much body roll, slightly vague steering), while the Corolla, Civic and Sentra feel like bland 'appliances' for the road when compared to the Focus's level of engagement with the driver.

<b>Design / Styling</b>

However, it's not all good news. The sedan I drove, with its cheesy metallic gold paint and 15 inch steel wheels looked extremely bland and uninspiring. The Focus hatchback may polarize opinons (some love it, some hate it), but at least it is visually interesting and well proportioned. The sedan, by comparison, looks dumpy and ungainly, the slope of the hood and design of the headlamps contrasting oddly with the block-like rear end. Not that there is much to choose from in the US or Canada with regard to small, good looking cars, but if I were to buy a Focus, I'd definitely go for the hatchback ZX3 or ZX5 (or ideally the SVT...), rather than the sedan.

<b>Comfort, Quality and Equipment </b>

The Focus's seats in my SE model were reasonably firm, but lacking a little in lateral support, and even after 45 minutes at the wheel, I found my lower back aching. The material used also feels cheap and overly synthetic to the touch, and I'm not sure how well the Focus's materials will stand up to hard use.

The Focus's body panels do not have the laser-precise fit of a Corolla or Civic, and even though the car I drove only had around 3000 miles on the clock, the hydraulic arms on the trunk lid were already struggling to hold the lid open. Perhaps these comments seem overly critical, but I think it is important to consider that while the Focus has certainly reached the very highest levels of driver engagement, there is still work to be done in the area of build quality and durability, which for many drivers planning to part with their own cash for this vehicle are at least as important.

Inside, the interior is reasonably well laid out and the design is quite striking. I particularly liked the clear arrangement of the three rotary controls for heating, ventilation, etc., and the placement of the stereo (above the HVAC controls, and within easy reach of the driver). Unfortunately, the plastics used are of dubious quality (not as poor as GM products, but a long, long way from VW's latest interiors), and some of the controls are oddly placed. For example, the height adjuster for the driver's seat is a rotary crank similar to those used for rolling down a car window, located underneath the front of the driver's seat; I found it awkward both to reach and use.

The height adjustable driver's seat is one example of the high equipment level on the Focus. The model I drove was also equipped with power windows (with one-touch down control on the driver's window), power mirrors and remote locking, as well as an AM/FM CD stereo, split/fold rear seat (leading to a very large trunk) and air conditioning. 

<b>Pricing / Value</b>

From a quick review of Ford's website, I believe all of the options mentioned above are standard on the base SE model, which retails for just over $15,000. A slightly better equipped model with the all-important Zetec engine runs just under $16,000.

The Focus's pricing seems reasonable to me, although I would caution that buyers will be getting a less well built car with poorer quality interior materials than a VW Golf, or any of the Japanese competition mentioned above. A significant issue affecting the decision to purchase is the Focus's somewhat erratic reliability record (several recalls, particularly on earlier models), but given my limited experience with the vehicle I can't comment specifically on this issue. Similarly, depreciation is significantly higher on the Focus, but this may be offset by incentives from Ford, and the willingness of Ford dealers to sell well under the MSRP. As an aside, I noticed a review her quoting a price of $18,000 for the Focus sedan, so someone please correct me if my numbers are wrong.

<b>Summary</b>

Overall, I highly recommend the Focus, primarily because it functions well as an effortless daily driver, but manages to blend this virtue with excellent handling and an overall driving experience far better than most of us have come to expect from compact cars. My only cautions for prospective buyers would be to make sure you are comfortable with the overall quality of the vehicle and confident about long-term reliability and durability. And don't forget to go for the Zetec engine...
