            I'm a newbie when it comes to dig cams. 
The first dig cam I saw was a nikon 950 over a year ago; you know that one with the swivelling body. I was surprized by the bizarre design but when my friend showed me the back-lit LCD and how u could take pictures looking at it - a la WYSIWYG, I was amazed by the technology and was quite excited. Very soon I was reading articles relating to dig cams like the latest CCD technology (CMOS), and reading forums about using dig cams maximally. Unwittingly I was letting myself be gradually swept away with the digital photography revolution. 

Of course I wanted to get a digital camera. A good one that would help me develop as a good photographer. I bought the G1 eventually; but at the back of my head I was afraid that it would disspoint me. What if i couldn't get good pictures from it? What if I could get better pictures from the nikon 9xx cameras? What if I can't get out of using auto-focus ??

I have had the G1 for 23 days now and fortunately the experience of using this gadget has been very fulfilling. I take 230+ pictures a day. I print the day's labor on my epson printer and the results have been very pleasing. The LCD works so well under any environment, even under sunlight which I was afraid previously might wash out the colors on the LCD. And I was starting to use the manual features on the camera like shutter control. So overall I am satisfied with my purchase. If only it would stop raining in Pittsburgh!
