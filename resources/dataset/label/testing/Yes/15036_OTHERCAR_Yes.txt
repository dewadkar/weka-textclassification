            I bought the Sony Mavica73 in February 2000, after &quot;lusting&quot; after it for a year.  In January 1999, my first grandchild was born, and I was away from my husband and younger daughter, as I attended to the new Mom, Dad and baby.  A friend had the Mavica 73 and was committed a beautiful random act of kindness, by coming to the hospital and taking pictures of the new family.  When we got back to their home for dinner, my friend proceeded to e-mail pictures to my husband, daughter and other extended family members of the new baby and new family.  Within 24 hours of Sebastian's birth, his image was my husband's screen saver at work.
You can't do that with pictures taken with a conventional camera, unless you take a picture of the picture, which this camera does beautifully!!

I love the ease of use, the fact that it uses regular diskettes and the quality of the pictures.  I take pictures all the time, and e-mail them to family and friends.  I don't hate anything about this camera.  It is the best thing to come along in a very long time.
Anyone who loves to take pictures should buy this camera. <br><br>
