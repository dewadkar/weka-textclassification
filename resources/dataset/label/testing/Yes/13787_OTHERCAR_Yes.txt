            My last five vehicles have been 4WD pickups and I like the security that 4WD gives for Winter driving. I found that I needed more passenger room than a standard cab offers, so I opted for the Dodge Quad Cab 1500 4WD. The back doors make accessing the back seat really easy, but the front door must first be open in order to open the rear doors. Still, the Quad Cab is a good compromise between four full doors and no rear doors at all. I opted for the 5.2 V-8 which provides all of the power I need . If the truck were to be used for towing, I would opt for a larger engine.
The ride is without a doubt the most comfortable pickup ride I have encountered. The off-road capabilities are limited, if you like to really get into the woods. The Quad Cab is a large vehicle and that is reflected in the turning radius and effective ground clearance. 
The EPA fuel mileage estimate is 12 - 16 MPG. I have been experiencing 13 - 14 MPG, with the best of 14.7 on purely highway miles. If you need the interior room and do not need extreme off-road capabilities...this is the truck for you. <br><br>
