            This was the first digital camera that I ever bought and I think it was the right decision. Small and lightweight, this camera has it all. It comes in a neat and secure box together with a pretty decent software package, including Ulead Cool, Photo Express. The one great thing about this little camera was that it hardly takes any time to set up.

I have a system running Windows ME and it took absolutely no time to set it up. The Windows Hardware detection wizard immediately detected it and I had it running within two minutes (with the driver CD in my CD drive).

Best of all this camera looks great...its sleek blue design is really "spacesaving"...I mean, it hardly occupies any space on its small triangular stand on my computer table.
It comes bundled with a really long USB cable which, of course, is another added advantage.

It takes only two AAA batteries, and when connected to the computer's USB port, it runs entirely off the computer's power supply. 

Now for the pictures. Pictures come out just okay....but if there is insufficient light, they come out somewhat grainy. But don't be put off by this...you can easily use Ulead PhotoExpress to enhance the image quality (which really works). As for the videocam mode, I had it running within no time. With the included software, I can record several minutes of audio + video. Video comes out great (with sound!) in "avi" format with Windows Movie Maker and the camera works well with other programs, such as Real Producer. The bundled software even allows you a choice of different video recording modes, which means that I can easily save my video clips to a more compressed format. Best of all, I can save my 640 x 480 clips as well as others at 30fps.

Another plus point is the timer mode and the continuous shot mode, which are ofcourse self-explanatory. Overall the camera has two modes for taking pictures...."High res" and "Low res". Believe it or not, but the standard mode allows me to store 107 images on the camera's built-in memory! The software really works well and pictures are transferred really really fast. So, basically, it's one amazing deal.

However, the only disadvantage with this camera is that there is no flash! (pretty ridiculous, but that's the way it is). Pictures need to be taken in sufficient light otherwise the camera's light sensor gives a beep, signalling insufficient light intensity.
Also, there's no zoom...but then again, this cost me $40!

So, basically think of it as one handy really, really compact digital still camera and a worthy camcorder!
