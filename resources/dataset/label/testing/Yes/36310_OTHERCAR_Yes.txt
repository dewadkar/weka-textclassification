            The G35 has been referred to as a BMW killer.  In my 7 months of owning this car my experience is such that for the price class, there isn't anything on the road that can touch it.  The car has excelled in overall quality, fit, finish, materials, and power train have been flawless.  If you are looking for a car that out performs 80% of anything on the road, and don't want to spend 1 weekend a month in the dealership shop for repairs, then this is your car.

I previously owned a Volvo S60, what a nightmare.  In 10 months the car was at the dealership 12 times for warranty work.  It had a recurring transmission problem that still existed when I traded it in.  It squeaked, rattled, had electrical problems, and the cruise control failed twice.  After 7 months and approximately 9,000 km the G35 has not had a single warranty repair, and only scheduled maintenance performed.

What I do not like about the car is the power seat controls positioned on the seat, between the drivers thigh and the cup holder.  This becomes highly irritating after anything more than a 1/2 hour drive. Also, this position is conducive to spillage due to the close position to the cup holder - brutal planning by Infiniti engineers!  

The steering wheel is not telescopic, meaning the comfort adjustment is limited to seat position.  I'm 6'3" and have yet to find a comfortable position.  A telescopic steering wheel would solve this, and one would expect this as a minimum given the luxury-entry level price of the car.

I agree with some of the other reviewers comments regarding the Bose stereo in the the Premium package car.  The stereo is very average in sound quality and you can't turn it up very loud without hearing interior panels rattle.

Service and dealership experience; Infiniti strives to attain Lexus levels but fails, by a long shot.  Essentially, you will primarily deal with Nissan service levels, nothing special, and certainly not anywhere near what one receives at a high end dealership like Lexus, BMW, or Audi.  Infiniti needs to set itself apart from Nissan for brand recognition and justification of premium pricing, otherwise, why not just buy a Maxima?

Fuel economy is about what one would expect for a 260 HP engine.  City is approximately 18-20 mpg, highway 20-25 mpg depending on conditions.

This is a drivers car.  The raw power is outstanding, the transmission has been taken from the much heavier Q45, meaning it is more transmission than the car really needs.  I surmise that this will result in longer term reliability performance.  The automatic is crisp at shifting, the throws are short, the power to surface is instant, and the car moves like a rocket.  

Bottom line, this car is not high on the luxury front, but is outstanding in performance, reliability, and great looks unmatched in a package that no other car in this price class can come close to.  Do your research, test drive them all, and you will agree.
