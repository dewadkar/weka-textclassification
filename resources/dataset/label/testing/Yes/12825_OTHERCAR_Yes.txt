            When I bought my Nissan Altima GXE in Las Vegas in 1998, it had about 36,000 miles on it.  I also bought the extended warranty from United Auto Care.  While in L.V. the brakes started making a funny sound. The Nissan West service center looked at it for free and took care of it without a bit of trouble or cost to me!  They did this on more than once-great service!  THEN I moved to New Orleans.  A bracket on the steering column broke causing the whole column to move side to side a couple inches.  Ray Brandt Nissan wouldn't even look at the car without charging a fee-to be taken off the cost of any repairs done (I've never been charged before!) Later they did waive that fee-after a lot of trouble. They said the bracket wasn't covered by any warranty and the whole steering column had to be replaced (big bucks!)  When I called the warranty co. they were belligerent-I asked to speak to a supervisor-they said they would not be intimidated and refused! I asked the service manager for the regional service manager's phone # and they gave me an 800# for a complaint line instead! I called that line and they argued with me about the complaint! Aren't they just supposed to note them?!?  It was pretty obvious that I wasn't going to be allowed to talk to anyone who was actually in a position to help me. There's more to the story but I'm keeping it brief-I got all kinds of excuses like, &quot;Well a 97' is really 4 years old because it's made in 96'.&quot;  So I guess the parts are only made for 4 years use....  Regardless of the actual problem-which was never resolved-the stone wall that I was given has insured my next car will be a Toyota. <br><br>
