            I just sold my 1989 Honda Civic that I have had for 11 years. I was looking for something totally different - a used Legend or Lexus  or something like that. After driving many different cars including Accords, Mazdas, Volkswagens, I stumbled across a 94 Diamante at a used car dealership. I fell in love with the car right away. It was exactly what I was looking for. I was amazed that I could buy this car for $7200 since the other cars I was looking at offered so much less car for much more money. Since I got $2,000 for my good, old Honda with 120K on it, I ended up spending around $5,000 for this beauty.

The Diamante drives like a dream, is quiet, full of wonderful lux touches like power/memory seats, great sound system, power everything and a very smooth engine/transmission with plenty of power. 

The build quality feels excellent with no squeaks or rattles even after 80,000 miles. It looks and feels like a new car-a testament to how well made it feels. 

I have no idea whether it will have the longevity of my Civic. And I feel sorry for the original owner who paid $30,000 for the car only to see it depreciate dramatically in 6 years. But I love driving it and would certainly recommend it as a bargain used car for anyone who is looking for a great handling, quiet and solid semi-lux car for cheap.<br><br>
