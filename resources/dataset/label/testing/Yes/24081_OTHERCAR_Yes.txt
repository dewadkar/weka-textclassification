            First of all, some websites are still selling the Dimera 3500 for $70-$99. Shop around and you will find it at under $50 and with some patience, on ebay for under $40.

1. Very easy initial set up. Just put the battery in, set it to "standard" or "fine" (picture quality) and start taking pictures. 
2. The software that it comes with is easy to install, set up, and to learn. You will be downloading photos and playing with them in minutes.
3. It comes complete so you are ready to go.
4. The "standard" picture setting is really awful but this allows you to take up 20+ photos and download is just a couple of seconds.
5. The "fine" picture setting is fairly good, shows fair amount of detail and download takes a few seconds, however, you will be limited to 8-10 photos with its 2MEG memory.
6. I like the auto shut off feature for longer battery life.
7. It takes some time between taking two pictures. The camera needs about 4-5 seconds to "reset" in order to take another photo.
8. Overall, for $35 plus shipping. You really get a lot out of it. The picture quality is good enough for "goofing off" or ebay but not for you son's or daughter's wedding.
9. This is one of the best $35 I spent when fun is taken into account and use as well.
