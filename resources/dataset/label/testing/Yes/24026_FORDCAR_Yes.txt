            During the last few years I have started to understand who Eddie Bauer is/was. For those of you who don't know, Ford has created a package that runs the price of the Expedition up appx. $5,000.00. First of all, Eddie was definitely the outdoor type.  My expedition is just an extension of Eddie. My &quot;truck&quot; loves to waller around in the mud sometimes finding the right spot to stop and make me go through the headaches of getting out and locking in my 4 wheel drive. OK, so all I really do is turn the knob by my steering column; sometimes though I just leave it in auto 4wd and I let Eddie decide when to adjust for those muddy areas.  He seems to make the right decision most of the time.

  Eddie must have been a lumberjack or in some type of field that required alot of pulling of large items.  I have hooked on to our tractor on it's trailor and pulled it miles and miles and Eddie hasn't let me down.  Eddie had to have had plenty of money; not meaning to assess his social status, but to explain how he could have paid for all of the gas that is used while pulling these heavy objects.  My truck actually gets about 12 miles to the gallon on the highway at 70mph or it gets 12 miles to the gallon at 15mph going up a big hill pulling 5 tons of tractor.  This truck is a workhorse; which probably means that Eddie was too.  

  Eddie was probably a &quot;camper&quot; of some sorts; which explains why you can take the third seat out, lay the second seats down and throw a full size mattress in the back and sleep comfortably.  I'll bet Eddie owned a fishing boat or a ski boat.  This truck can make backing a boat trailor a pleasure even for the less experienced backers.  Eddie was a guy who enjoyed the comforts of quality as well.  Why else would he have designed adjustable leather seats, rear air controls and rear seat radio controls?  All in all, if you are looking for a fairly comfortable ride with a commanding view of the road, the interior quality features of a luxury automobile, the &quot;muscle&quot; of one of the most powerful SUV's made look to the Eddie Bauer edition Ford Expedition. 

 One final piece of advice that I was told today by my mechanic.  If your theft system doesn't seem to be working properly and your lights stay on on your running boards and interior, it is fairly common in the expedition.  Grab some WD40 and spray it inside all of your door latches; they tend to stick regularly creating the above symptoms.<br><br>
