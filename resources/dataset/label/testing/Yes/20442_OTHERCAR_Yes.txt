            After buying a 1998 VW Passat station wagon (Yes, a FAMILY car) and finding out that I loved it, it was time to replace the aging Toyota Camry I used for business.  It wasn't difficult to make my first stop at the VW dealers in town (Syracuse, NY).

A few test drives of different configurations and engines was all it took to set my heart on a 2000 VW Jetta VR6.  I had had experience with the turbocharged 1.8 Liter engine in my Passat which is surprising powerful but when I drove the Jetta VR6 it sold me!

Most of my driving is done on the New York State Thruway from Syracuse to Albany, New York.  The Jetta VR6 is a dream car to drive on our pitted, potholed version of the Autobahn.  In fact, I had t force myself to use the cruise control to avoid the withering stares of the New York State Troopers.

Best of all, even with the surplus of power and go, the Jetta VR6 is surprisingly docile and stable on snow and ice!  The anti-skid mechanism really does work!

Powerful, fun to drive, and good in cold, snowy weather (Get the cold weather package option for about $150 which includes goodies like heated front seats &amp; heated outside mirrors), the 2000 Jetta VR6 is a great buy with deceptive performance.  Just imagine a VW being able to shut down the glitzy American muscle cars...!  Try one, you'll like it!<br><br>
