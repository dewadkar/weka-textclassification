            We've had our van for 3.5 years now and have virtually no problems with it.  One and a half years into the life of the van, we had to get a new transmission, courtesy of Toyota.  Other than that, we've had no major problems.  We've had a problem with the sliding door on the right.  They can't seem to fix it.  We're not sure what the actual problem is.  It's not a big deal, though.  We like the captain's chairs in the second row.  We have our two children's car seats in them and they fit quite nicely.  It's a very comfortable van for everyone.  The only down side is that the "trunk" is just not big enough.  We're always looking for more space and it's just not there.  Other than that, we're very satisfied Toyota owners.  The service department treats us as if we own a Mercedes Benz.  They are just great!
