            Let's see, car shopping. I hate making a final decision.So I did my homework and decided.I was a big fan of Saturn, but none of there vehicles had enough room from the front seat to the back seat.I have long legs and I felt crunched when I test drove the car.So you may ask, What was I going to do? I decided to look at the dodge dealership because I liked the sporty look of there cars.

My decision with any car was that I had a cd player and good gas mileage and safe for my kids.So I test drove the 2000 dodge intrepid and felt that the front seats had a lot of leg room and room to lay back with out hitting the back seat.My kids had a lot of room in the back seat.I had enough room I could put two large car seats and a third person in the back seat and that is very hard to find in any car.

I also wanted to go on trips with this car because I felt safe and comfortable.This car is reliable.I went from central California to Oregon with this car.That was a 10 hour trip one way.My back never hurt and I only had to fill the car up two times.That has never happened before.

If you want a reliable car and a company who has built a car to last, then I would go and get a 2000 dodge intrepid.This car is also a luxury car for those nights that you want to go to a nice dinner or have both couples go with you to a nice night of fun.You will be proud to drive this car.

To add a little more to your decision.My husband is a car guru and he did not like this car and he went out and bought a 1995 acura integra with leather sits and sun roof.Guess what? The car is now in the garage because it has broken down!!!!!Ha-Ha.I feel that you could not go wrong with this vehicle.<br><br>
