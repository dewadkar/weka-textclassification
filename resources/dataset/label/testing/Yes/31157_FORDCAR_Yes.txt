            I purchased my 1998 Ford Mustang GT in June of 1998 brand new. It's white with grey leather interior with the 17 inch wheels.  I was having a bit of a turning 30 crisis so I figured what the heck I traded in a Ford Explorer (big change). I love this car.  This car gets me into trouble for going to fast but only 1 ticket to date.  I love the interior it's very roomy for the type of car it is, and very comfortable. The mach 460 stereo system is the best factory stereo I've ever heard. I think the only thing that could be better is if I had gotten a convertible. I think these cars will never go out of style.<br><br>
