            Pre-Summer 99, and it was time for a larger vehicle.  Being the Chevy enthusiast I am, I automatically jumped towards Silverados, but we were buying used and the Blazer was all they had in Chevy.  Taking the Sport Ute on a test drive was one thing, but in a strange city, a total throwback, or so I thought.  Anyways, lets talk love/hate.  I don't like the thought of underpowered vehicles, and was skeptical about a v6 sport utility.  On the test drive in Tampa, Fl, i realized that this Blazer was far from underpowered.  The combination of a strong engine, with pretty comfortable interior hooked me right away.  This vehicle has very good sound from a stock stereo.  The bucket seats leave something to be desired for those with lower back pain, or arthritis, the lumbar support is a good idea, but only good sometimes.  Driving this vehicle is a dream, strong acceleration, very little noise at speed, and good braking allow me to give this vehicle a 9 out of 10.  If you have a family of 4 people or less, this is a very good vehicle to own.  If you have bad arthritis, or lower back problems, either dont buy, or if you do, get the seats replaced.  The seats you will get used to after a long trip though, trust me, the trip from south Fl. to New Mexico was long enough.<br><br>
