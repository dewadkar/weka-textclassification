            I bought my 1997 Honda Civic CX hatchback in November 1996, and it's been an absolute blast.  I can't recommend it enough.

I bought this car new, with no options other than air conditioning, for just under $11,400 (out the door with taxes and fees for right at $12,500).  This was the first time I had to take out a loan to purchase a car, and it's been worth every cent.

Why?

First, performance.  It weighs 2300 lbs., or thereabouts, and has 106hp, which isn't astonishing, but with a 5 speed, that's good for 110mph if you've got an open road and are willing to be patient.  If you add a decent set of tires when the first set wear out, the already good handling increases enormously.  It will turn on a dime now that I've got some Dunlop D60's on it, and if you can make the tires squeal, you're probably trying too hard.  Plus, if you get the bone-stock CX, there's no power steering, which increases the go-cart/race car feel, which I enjoy tremendously! 

Second, convenience. It hold 5 people in reasonable comfort, although I wouldn't want to go on a several day road trip with that many on board.  There's plenty of space in the hatch, and even more once you fold the rear seats flat.  It gets 30+ mpg if you drive it even remotely reasonably, and if you stomp on it mercilessly, you'll still get 27mpg easy.

All in all, the Civic CX Hatchback is a rockin' all around car!

It's cheap if you're willing to haggle, it's reasonably fast if you get the stick shift (there's no point in owning an automatic Honda, unless you're inheriting it from your grandma, or get it used for a real low price),it holds 5 comfortably and gets good mileage, and has plenty of space in the hatch.

And it's a Honda, which means you can expect to drive it without major hassles for 5-10 years.

A fast reliable economical car that I can fit 4 of my friends in as well as myself?  Yup, that's the Honda Hatchback!

Plus, if you get the urge, there are all kinds of aftermarket parts, from stereo kits to superchargers, so if you need to make your car reflect your style, but can't afford the Vette or the Jag just yet, the Honda's the way to go!

Update - 12/26/01 - My car is now 5 years old, and just passed the 75,000 mile mark.  It hasn't been perfect, as I nailed a big pothole, and needed whole portions of the suspension replaced, but overall, it's been a great car.

If you're on a budget, but want something fun, economical, and sporty, I can't recommend a Civic with a stickshift highly enough!

I took it from LA to San Fran and back this week, and it was very happy running between 85 and 105 mph for dozens of miles at a stretch.  Sure, there are plenty of faster cars out there, but there were only two cars that blew by me like I wasn't there when I was going 80-90 plus; one was a Lincoln Navigator, and the other was a Ford Windstar Minivan, so I didn't feel bad that my Civic couldn't keep up with the other sportscars, as they were mostly driven by old fogies in the slow lane. 

It still tops out at 110, but it's perfectly happy to cruise at anything less than that.

It should last for another 5 years plus, at which point hopefully I'll be able to trade it in for something much less practical, but there's a lot to be said for owning a Civic.
