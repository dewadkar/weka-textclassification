            The current success of VW has been built primarily on the appeal of the Jetta.

Over the years I have owned many Volkswagen products and for 5+ years I owned a small repair/sales business that earned a good portion of its income from loyal VW people.  

Ironically, I started out in VW repair at an early age due to my total dissatisfaction with my dealer and another independent shop. (Neither business is around today)  I bought the manual and did all my own repairs and I learned as I went.  I bought some tools along the way and supplemented my meager income with a repair or two and a sale or two here and there.  That was over 20 years ago but today I have to say that even with the major advances in safety the Volkswagen of my youth is a grown up, like me.  

Of all the offerings in the Jetta lineup I narrowed the field to one choice,
the 1.8t GLS with leather, sport package and upgraded sound system.  

What made sense about the 1.8t were a few things:

1. Power/efficiency  this is due to the 5 valve per cylinder in-line four with a performance controlled turbo.  Turbo charging adds efficiency by using exhaust gasses to push air through the intercooler and on to the intake allowing for a denser charge of air to mix with the gasses, thereby creating greater thrust from the combustion process.  

(although, VW is relatively new in the turbo charging department this engineering has been thoroughly worked out with their sister company Audi)

2.  Resale value  if you have picked up a classified guide or surfed through any number of avenues to find any late model VW you will notice they are holding strong.  I recently sold my 98 Jetta TDI private sale to a long time friend and service customer for what I believed was a fair price, $13,800.00.  After selling this car and driving my old Audi for a while I thought if I found another TDI for sale I might consider a purchase as the 48-50 mpg is nice and I commute big miles.  At a local dealer a 98 Jetta TDI appeared out front so of course I thought I would check it out.  The car offered more miles than my previous car and really no options other than A/C and power locks.  This was looking like a bargain.  I parked near the showroom and went in to get the price.  After what seemed like forever I managed to get the attention of a sales manager and ascertained the selling price to be $15,300, and two years ago I purchased mine for 16,300.  That was about $4000.00 more than book, wholesale.  Needless to say my offer was not going to be anywhere near &quot;deal&quot;.

3. Warranty/Repair of all the new VW/Audi products I have owned I have been very happy with the reliability and infrequency of repairs, with the exception of my first VW and I don't think that anyone had good results or good service as the product was too new as a platform.  Once the warranty has expired I repair them myself.

Enough nostalgia, the drive was OSI, (oh so informative)  This 2001 Jetta from the closing of the drivers door was a signed deal.  The door itself, when closed, sounded like what the Foley artists create to sound like a secured fire door.  I�d like to use the M word but this is better than M as it costs so much less than an MB. 

Ok to fidget while I get the seat and controls set, ignition==&gt; ==&gt; ==v
                                                            v= &lt;== &lt;==
                                                            v
                                                            v
 This car goes!  &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== &lt;== 
17&quot; Alloys with skinny (short sidewall) 225/45/17 tires that really hug the road.  The only dislike here is the very pronounced torque steer under hard acceleration.  The engine sings and wants to rev higher. Cornering was slot car like. This is a car that VW can, in my opinion, win people with. Shifts were easy, transitions were seamless, the brakes reacted precisely and the interior was dead silent while the feel says, �Autobahn, I need Autobahn�.

 
The 2001 Jetta 1.8t does have some down sides if compared to the Jetta III design.  Interior space is smaller and the trunk space is also smaller but the car is so well built that the space lost is minor.  If you need more room the Jetta wagon is set to debut in the spring. 

Quick points that are benefits:
Euro Crash testing rates this sedan 5 stars. (excellent)
Side Air Bags, curtains, belt pretensioners and limiters.
Fuel economy average 32mpg highway (5 speed)
ABS
Full spare on matching rim
Security System/ remote operated/ with a panic feature
8 speaker sound system that sounds extremely accurate
Integrated Headlamp/fog lamp/directional system
Smiles 

Go test drive one today!
If you are like me there will be one arriving in your neighborhood soon!
