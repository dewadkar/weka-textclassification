            I bought my 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage new. It was an upgrade from a Festiva. It never has had speed, but only a few problems. I hit a deer a couple years ago and I think the collision place did more damage. The air conditioning has blown out twice. I don't think they fixed it right when it was smushed. The bumper they painted has chipped. The parts are expensive. The driver's seat looses stuffing. The carpet has never stayed tucked on the passenger front seat. I have gone through three radiators - again linked to the deer. 

Otherwise it gets great gas mileage. I am up to 34 MPG. The tires are small and cheap. I got them wider the last time and splurged on new rims after bending a couple. It has 113,000. I think I can get the transmission revamped and it can last a long time. If all else fails I can put in a slightly bigger engine and feel like a race car driver.

I like my new zealand green, 4 door sedan. I can fit me and three beefy men in it and it only drags a little. The trunk is huge. It's the only Mitsubishi I like.
