            I just bought a digital camera(Nikon Coolpix 950) for business after the comparison with Kodak DC290, Olympus C-2000 Z from their specification. 
After a period of use, I find Coolpix 950 has the following features not found on other brands':
1. lens can be rotated in 360 degree
2. 20 mm close-up picture grabbing 
3. capable of changing wide-angle or fish-eye lens(purchased separately)
4. very little color aberration

The only thing that I do not satisfy is the battery, because I must replace battery several times for my 64M card and re-setting the date and some parameters for the camera.<br><br>
