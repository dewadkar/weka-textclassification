            The Tahoe is a great mid-sized SUV.  It's wheel base could be a bit wider but is never a factor in city driving.  This SUV has more than enough power and torque.  Need to tow your boat, not a problem.  You hate the way your SUV corners and parks well that's typical for this genre of automobile but the speed sensitive steering makes things a bit easier.  I have a four member family and the Tahoe is perfect for any trip we plan.  There is enough leg room in the back for the passenger to lean back considerably and the back seat handles two sleeping teenagers quite well.  This is the same car as the Cadillac Escalade minus the interior and exterior upgrades and the price tag.  The sound system in this GM is exceptional as well, especially in response to it's quiet ride.  A highly noted upgrade from the Tahoes of yester-years is the back A/C vents, which can be controlled from the cockpit and the back seat.
