            EXTENDED PRO'S:
AMAZINGLY compact for a 2-MP, 3X optical zoom camera
Fast F2.8/3.6 lens (faster than most subcompact digicams)
FAST startup time (under 2 seconds, faster than almost all digicams)
Fast continuous mode
Rechargeable battery and charger included
Movie mode with sound (nice bonus!)
Pretty good pictures for web or small prints

EXTENDED CONS:
Picture quality not as good as other 2-MP cameras
Flash uses ISO 200 (to compensate for low power)
No custom set white balance (what do you expect in a point and shoot?)


This is a GREAT camera for the point and shooter, or as a second camera for more advanced amateurs. The reason being that a pretty good quality photo is way better than no photo at all (and you will always have this camera with you.)

This camera is designed for convenience and quick pictures. It's about HALF the size of a Palm Pilot PDA, but has 2 Megapixel resolution and a full 3X OPTICAL zoom lens. It starts up fast (under 2 seconds), and takes fast pictures with an excellent buffer. There are no manual modes, but you do have exposure compensation and some white balance modes (no custom setting though.)

The picture quality is pretty good, but not as good as larger 2-MP cameras. But for web photos or smaller (up to around 5 x 7) prints you may not notice the difference anyways! Anything larger than that and you'll probably notice the prints are not as they could be.

I rate the battery life as good, since the rechargeable comes in the box and delivers pretty good performance considering the size. Also, with the LCD off the power consumption is EXTREMELY low.

This camera was designed with specific goals in mind and succeeds on almost all counts. If you want a camera you can keep with you at all times, I would STRONGLY consider the Dimage X. I only wish the picture quality were a TAD better to put it with all the other 2-MP cameras.

PS- This camera uses SD format memory cards to save space. This is fine, but keep in mind that SD cards are more expensive than CF or SM cards. Just make sure you budget for a card since the 8 MB card is insufficient.
