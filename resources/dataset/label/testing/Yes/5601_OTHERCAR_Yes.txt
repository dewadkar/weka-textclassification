            My Mazda delivered everything I hoped for for the price and more. I bought it fresh out of college, and drove it happily for three years until totalling it in an accident. 

WHO WOULD LOVE ONE
A college student, recent grad, or family on a budget who are looking for reliability and a car they won't be ashamed to drive, but not necessarily something too flashy.

PROS
- My Mazda never once broke down, refused to start, stalled, or underperformed.
- The ride was more comfortable with 5 passengers than any other car I've ridden in for its size. It also handled multiple carseats well when babysitting, and the back doors' openings were wide enough to be practical loading packages, pets, or kids.
- It was great on gas (30-34MPG with an automatic), easy to park, and had plenty of storage space in the trunk.
- It handled very well in NH snow - a very big concern for me in the purchase decision.
- Braking and steering were very comfortable and responsive. Car was powerful enough to merge into traffic in a short distance. 
- It had a good package of standard safety features.
- Visibility was overall very good, unlike some comparable 1997 makes with huge blind spots. 
- When I priced insurance rates on it and other cars I was considering in its price class, the rates for the Mazda were lower than its competitors.

THE ACCIDENT - A BIG PRO!
The only reason I am not still driving this car is a big reason I would recommend it to others. I was in an accident where I was hit from the drivers side so hard that I spun into a guard rail, hitting it head-on at about 20 mph. I am happy to report that the car performed above and beyond my expectations in this situation! 

Both airbags deployed, and my seatbelt obviously worked well, as I would expect. The crumple zones certainly crumpled - the car looked a mess! However, considering the force of both impacts, and the fact that I walked away without so much as a scratch, says a great deal to me about the safety of the car. 

As a side note, as a smaller woman, the force of the airbags was not enough to hurt me, and the design of the car allowed easy enough reach of the controls that I did not have to sit on top of the steering wheel like in other cars I've driven.

The car also had low-impact bumpers, where another car "nudged" me a few times, and there were no dents or scratches left.

CONS
- Acceleration could have been better, particularly when the car was heavily loaded, or when going uphill.
- The road noise was more prominent than in some of its competitors.
- Baseline models are BASELINE - no frills there!
- The factory speakers weren't great - I ended up upgrading the stereo system, including the speakers. 
- The transmission would sometimes shift a little heavily, and was not as smooth as other cars I've ridden in.
