            Don�t you just hate anything that is popular?  I do.  In fact I have often started to dislike things I previously loved, simply because they were becoming too popular.  Stupid, I know.  Many people dislike SUVs for the same reason, they are just too popular, I was the same way.  If you dislike SUVs then surely you would hate the 2000 Chevrolet Suburban � it is the very heart of the sport utility vehicle market.

�Why do people need such a big car?� I�ve often asked myself.  The answer is simple � it�s convenient.  Party tables, donated clothes, a full size bed, there is no end to what the Suburban will swallow. Plus you can arrange the seats to accommodate more people, more things, or half and half.

Driving the Suburban is not the chore you�d expect.  The 2000 Suburban is a 100 times improvement over the �99.  Handling is excellent, although I�d stop just short of calling it car-like. The 1999 Suburban felt like a big truck with a lot of nice stuff thrown on, the 2000 rides like a big station wagon.  Body lean and roll are minimal, and braking is straight and smooth.  Acceleration is above average for its size. The 300 hp, 6.0 L V-8 does its job without noise or drama.  Parking is also surprisingly easy � it�s big without FEELING big.  From behind the wheel, I had only one complaint.  Like many Chevy trucks, there is too much travel in the brake pedal.  Braking is fine, but the extra 1/100th of a second it takes for the brakes to engage can induce that roller coaster feeling in your stomach at times.

Inside the Suburban are all the amenities one could want.  Leather seats are Lazy-boy comfortable, and the power adjustments have more positions than I could count.  Just when you think you�re out of storage space up front, another little bin is found.  With ease I stored a large CD holder, day-planner, wallet, sunglasses, cell-phone w/ power cord, 3 videotapes, and leftovers from lunch at La Salsa.  None of these items were riding on the floor or the passenger seat where they would surely slide off, never to be found again. Another strong point of the Suburban is the air conditioning.  Even on a hot day it gets too cold � back seat passengers have their own vents and can control the airflow independent of the front seat riders.   Rear seat passengers can also chose their own audio program independently� bring your own headphones.  The cargo area quickly and easily transforms from people hauler to cargo carrier.  Unlike the Chevy Tahoe, the rear seat comes out as one unit, and is a little heavy for one person to carry.

One minor complaint about the interior: 1) at $40,000 the Suburban should have the GM trip computer they love to put in every other car they make. This thing is made for long trips.  

Overall the Chevrolet Suburban is a great vehicle, don�t hate it because it�s useful.  Plenty of room, plenty of power, and not bad to look at, it all adds up to make the Suburban the king of the SUV market. Just don�t expect to save money on gas.
