            Let's get ready to rumble!!!!!   Since '92, the Volvo 240DL Wagon has been part of my family.  Now it's the year 2000 and the wagon is still running in tip top shape.  8 years after it's purchase, 100,000 miles later, the wagon is still taking myself and my family members around the east coast, even in the worst weather.  From Boston, to Baltimore.  Even Michigan.  Despite the regular tune-ups and a few rotors replaced during the year, the &quot;war wagon&quot; has not failed me yet.  It's good for moving (foldable back seats), walking our dog at the park, road trips with friends, and just kicking back and driving.  

Sometimes the wind picks up on the highway, and the car rattles, but it's probably one of the safest cars in the world.  I'm not worried if I get into an accident because Volvo has been famous for it's secure frame-build and airbags.  

If you can afford this car, and if they even make this car, it's worth it.  A safe comfortable ride.  What more can you ask for in a car? <br><br>
