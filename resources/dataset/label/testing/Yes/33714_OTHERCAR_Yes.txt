            I set up my first darkroom over 40 years ago and was thrilled when Photoshop liberated me from the chemicals and whims of the commercial labs 6 years ago. I've stayed away from digital because film delivered more bang for the buck until now. The Argus DC-3810, with 5 megapixel resolution has changed that. I get 11x14" prints that require a magnifyer to distinguish from photo prints, at a fraction of the cost, totally under my control.

The details: The lens is very sharp with great depth of field; the controls and menus are very logical with safeguards to avoid accidental deletion; though not mentioned in the web product data, macro focusing, down to 8cm, is possible; everything works as it should;  the learning curve is short if you have any background in SLR's at all. 

The few sacrifices I accept for the $300 or so I saved over the next 5 megapixel camera: A slow (but sharp)  f:3.37, 3x optical and 2x digital zoom lens; no hot shoe.

Faults: poor auto-focusing in low light (which is common in most auto focus cameras of any price) (I use the adequate manual focusing option when needed); 2.5meter flash limit (I use a slave flash for longer shots not handled by the native flash.)

I am highly satisfied with this camera. It feels good and delivers excellent results for anyone with more than point and shoot  ambitions and a limited budget.
