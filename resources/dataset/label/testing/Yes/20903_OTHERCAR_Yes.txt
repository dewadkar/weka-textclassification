            I've been waiting to be able to touch a PT Cruiser, let alone, drive one for months now. So you can imagine my surprise when I just happen to drive by a Chrysler Proving Grounds on a road trip pit stop looking for food.

The Chrysler Proving Grounds is a place where Chrysler basically has an open house for its new line of automobiles. This time, they were showing off, the Sebring Convertible, the Voyager minivan, the 300M touring sedan, the luxurious LHS, and of course, the too cool to categorize, 2001 PT Cruiser.

After I snapped some photos and took the 10 minute orientation, I was allowed to finally drive the PT Cruiser. It was no surprise, that the line to test drive the PT Cruiser was 3 times as long as the other lines. The driving course they setup basically took you through various driving conditions that you might encounter in your new vehicle.

My first surprise was that my 6'3&quot; larger frame was able to fit very nicely in the driver's side of the PT Cruiser with room to spare. The tilt steering wheel added even more room. After checking the rear view mirrors and other instruments and views, it was easy to see that this vehicle was engineered for both people who love to drive and the passengers who ride along with them. Everything was in reach.

With a 150HP, this car had enough get up and go for the car class it was designed. With the available turbo charge kit from MOPAR, speed demons can get their fix of even more horsepower. It handled S curves and U-Turns with ease, although in a test of the turning radius, it seemed to curve wide when going in a tight circle.

The brakes were definitely tested in this course, with a simulated school bus sign calling for an emergency stop and a speed test near the end with a short stopping distance. The PT Cruiser handled both these tests well, with little to no skidding while being able to stop quickly.

My favorite two parts of the course were the speed test and the &quot;pot holes&quot;. In the speed test, the PT Cruiser was brought to a halt, and then you were instructed to hit the gas and accelerate as fast as possible while a speed gun tracked your time in about a quarter mile stretch. I think my speed hit about 45MPH before I had to brake for the stop sign. During the &quot;pot hole&quot; test, the PT Cruiser went over simulated pot holes to test the ride and handling and I must say, if I was drinking a cup of coffee, not a drop would've been spilled.

Overall, I'd say this is a great car for many lifestyles. I saw young and old, families and even teenagers there looking for their first car. It is as functional and comfortable on the inside as it is funky and cool on the outside. Now I just have to wait until my name gets called so I can pick up mine at the dealer...<br><br>
