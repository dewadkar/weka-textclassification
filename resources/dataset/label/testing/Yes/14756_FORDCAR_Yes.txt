            3 years ago, on the day after Christmas, a neighbor slid on some ice with her van and hit one of my cars.  This was the last straw for this poor car and I was forced to buy a new one.  Or rather a new used car.  This was days before I was to start a new job and really needed a reliable car.  My daily compute would be about 200 miles round trip.

Because we live in a fairly rural area, there aren't a whole lot of car dealerships to visit.  My husband knew which one I wanted to go to but had us visit every other dealer in the county first.  Well, I found my new used car at the dealership I wanted to go to.  

This car didn't look like anything special.  It was small and had good gas mileage.  The odometer had low mileage on it also and the car seemed in good shape.  We were offered a good price and took it.  Yep, right off the lot without paying for it.  No, the owner knew we took it.  I said it was a rural area and he knew I'd be back to pay when the banks opened.

I wish I could say that I never had any trouble out of my little car.  I would be lieing though if I did.  When you buy a used car, usually you have a limited warrenty; so many miles or so many days.  45 days after buying my little car, 2 weeks past my warrenty, the front bearings went out.  Even though I was past my warrenty, the dealership covered it.  However, a year and 86,000 miles later, these same bearings went out again and I had to pay to fix them.

I have also had to replace the motor.  I'm not sure what happened as I wasn't driving when the motor died, but I do know that I had driven that car hard.  When the motor went I had put on over 100,000 miles and driven it at high speeds for over a year.  We lucked out and was able to find another Aspire engine with under 10,000 miles on it.  It's been working fine.  Of course, I've changed jobs and don't drive like I was.

I can get lots into it.  I lot more than people think.  You should see their looks at Sam's Club when I start loading and it all fits!  

An off the wall problem.  Because of the design of my key, it keeps breaking.  I use a half key for the starter and have had to had new keys made a least a half dozen times.  One day I may get around to changing the locks but right now I'm fine.

Not only do I like my little car, but my daughter does too.  We like that it's small enough to fit in small places but big enough to do the job.  I also, with the price of gas, like that I got good gas mileage.  I'm going to miss my little car when I wear it out.
