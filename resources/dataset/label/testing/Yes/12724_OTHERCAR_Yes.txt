            What can I say other than that this is one of the best Sport Utility Vehicles for the money you spend.  With prices ranging from $22,000 to $30,000, you get a great SUV that handles like a dream both on and off road.  This SUV handles like a car rather than a truck, which is especially attractive to parents who wish to own a SUV.  Rather than lumbering around in an oversized SUV that handles like an 18 wheeler rather than a passenger vehicle, you can drive around in your sporty attractive Montero Sport.  For around $25,000, you can get the LS model which has power windows and locks, automatic transmission, 4 wheel drive, rear heat and air, and digital odometer.

The 6-cylinder Engine is perfect for providing enough acceleration and towing power while maximizing fuel efficiency.  Entering the flow of traffic on highways and overtaking other cars is a cinch with the Overdrive function (which can be turned on or off for fuel efficiency. 

The Traction function allows you to control acceleration in questionable road conditions to prevent sliding when starting.  The ABS allows you to stop in these same conditions.

Compare all of these items with the same equipment on a Toyota Forerunner, and you could expect to paying a lot more than $30,000.  Basically, Mitsubishi has created a sporty SUV that drives well on the road, off the road, and does this at a price that is a lot more affordable than comparable models of SUV.
