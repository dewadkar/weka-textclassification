            This extended wheelbased 1999 Pontiac Montana van is a godsend for travelling with a family of any size!  The V6 powerplant provides great but not noisy acceleration.  

The seats are very comfortable (esp. front).  The rear seats aren't bad but adding a child seat in the middle tremendously decreases the room.  Plus, it means no mid seat cupholders.  The included air compressor is worthless, buy a real 12 volt one for $25.  The seats in the rear can be removed or folded to make great cargo room.

The traction control and ABS helps increase safety.  The van is easy to drive and the dual AC is effective.  Like the automatic rear vents (open from front) and power sliding pass. door.  The trip command center above the rear view mirror is helpful and it only needs GPS to be complete.   <br><br>
