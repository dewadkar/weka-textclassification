               In 1994, Dodge set the standard in style and usability in full-size trucks. Ford followed suit in 1996&1/2 finally eliminating that awful "twin I beam" front suspension with it's awful camber change characteristics and creating an interior that people with a 36"+ inseam could fit into without tilting the column all the way up. General Motors initial response was that Dodge and Ford needed the redesign but GM trucks didn't. Two or so years later the GM twins got a redesign anyway and are now probably the most refined and powerful trucks of the three. (I wonder if the guy who said that is still making statements for GM?)So now the innovator is the "old man". It's the most trucklike of them all and that's one of it's best characteristics to me. Sort of like if you picture three animated trucks like the ones in a Chevron commercial:

Chevy/GMC: "Feel that refinement? I'm part Cadillac." (Escalade)
Ford: "So, I'm part Lincoln." (Navigator)
Dodge: (spits)Yep, I got some Mercedes Benz kin but we ain't blood relatives or nothin'."

   One of my favorite things about driving this truck was the 318 ci V8. Even with a totally stock exhaust the engine makes it's presence known. A sweet burbling V8 note. Not in an intrusive way but in a reassuring, "I got plenty here baby..." It's roots go way back to before we cared about air quality and before OPEC pulled the plug on all the big block fun. Far from fast in actuality, it's just too big and heavy to be really fast, it still acts, sounds, and even feels the part of a big American hot rod. It may have helped my overall subjective view that ZZ Top's Deguello was in the Infinity CD player pumping out "I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide..." Just substitute V8 Dodge for V8 Ford. (well that and I don't have a gold tooth and I was wearing a Suzuki cap not a New York brim...but still) Typical of older trucks the rear suspension is really stiff. You'll especially notice this when the front glides over a speed bump and the rear hops up on it. To me the Ford's Modular OHC V8s feel disconnected from the driver. As powerful but more like driving a late model Crown Victoria than a Charger with that same 318. Parking lot manuevering is a bit cumbersome. The front tires seem like they push a bit (understeer) at full steering lock and low speed. I am accustomed to driving shorter vehicles so I had to remind myself when making right turns that the rear end wasn't there yet. It certainly isn't a Prelude with 4 wheel steering but handles well for it's size.

  In the interior, the front seats have the seat belts built in to them just like the Sebring Convertible. That is a great feature compared to the old hanging belt arrangement in the Ford I drove. The Infinity Stereo is great and I liked the steering wheel mounted controls. At least for awhile anyway. I started thinking of the complexity and figured I could do without. The cupholder section of the dash is HUGE. I love that. The temp indicator above the rearview mirror indicated 102 degrees but even with the blower on a relatively low speed the interior stayed cool. Everything but the odometer is well placed and easy to see or use. It could use more leg room but that's ok I suppose. Most people aren't over 6'2" and I guess those of us at the extreme ends have to suffer a little. I figure a short person has the same problems in the opposite direction.

  Get the 318 while you can if you like it because I understand that it's gone next year. I really like this motor though. Maybe I'll try the 360.
