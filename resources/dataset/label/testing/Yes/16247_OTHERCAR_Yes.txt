            I'm driving a Corolla this week, which was what was available at Hertz in San Jose.  (I had to wait 2 hours at the counter before the car got ready, totally unacceptable in any other part of the world, but about what you'd expect in car-clogged Silicon Valley).

The biggest problem as a rental is that the Corolla is such a nice, bland, inoffensive, unmemorable ride and that there are so many of them on the road that you might forget where you parked the car, and even if you do remember the general vicinity there's a good chance someone else parked their Corolla within 50 feet of yours.

Acceleration was good not great, interior controls all worked pretty much as expected, reasonable amounts of room up front - all ideal features of a pick up and go sort of vehicle.  As usual with rentals I have no idea how it would hold up under ownership conditions, though I suspect it would be quite good.

Unlike late model Hondas and Nissans that I have driven, this Toyota seemed - well - more Japanese than most small cars.  I don't know how to put my finger on it but there you go.

I would gladly get a Toyota Corolla every time I rented.<br><br>
