            The Canon G2 is a camera I expect to have for many years. You can get a sense of the quality of its construction and design just by holding it. 

It is so versatile that I doubt my skills will outgrow it. Others in my family need a point-and-shoot camera. The G2 does that. And it produces outstanding quality pictures with its 4 megapixel CCD. I want to be able to adjust the camera for special needs. The G2 allows that too. As my skills grow, the G2 will allow me whatever level of flexibility I desire.

The swivel LCD screen is a real plus. I understand Canon has used this design on a few other models. This is a common feature on camcorders, so I am surprised it is not more common on digital cameras. The 1.8 inch screen swings out from the camera, can be swiveled to face the front so the photographer can be in the picture and see the image that will be taken. (Using the included wireless remote makes this a breeze.) The LCD can also be turned up or down so that the image is visible if you need to hold the camera over your head or at your feet for a particular shot. Best of all, the LCD also swivels 180 degrees so that it can be stored with the screen facing the camera back, protecting it from scratches or fingerprints when in storage. 

I also love the panorama mode and the included software which makes it possible to stitch together shots up to 360 degrees.

The G2 is expensive, when you consider that 1 megapixel cameras can be had for as little as $100 these days. I think there is real value here though. A $100 digital camera will be quickly outgrown by many users. I doubt if I will ever get bored with the G2.
