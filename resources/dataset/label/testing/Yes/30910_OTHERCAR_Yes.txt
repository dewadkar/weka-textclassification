            I'm presently one year into my second lease of a Mercury Villager.  My first lease was a two-year lease in 1996.  That car was perfect!  In retrospect, I wish I had purchased it.  However, it was my first minivan, and I wasn't too sure if I wanted to stay with that large of a car.  I soon became a lover of minivans.  The handling of the Villager is so easy--no different from a car.  I love riding high and being able to see better.  I was concerned about trouble with parking, but soon found out that it was not long and cumbersome to deal with like the long Chrysler/Dodge minivans.  My brother-in-law is a four time owner of  Chrysler/Dodge minivans.  After driver his a vans a few time, I find the Villager much easier to handle, and my daughter, who gets car-sick very easily, is much less likely to get sick in the Village because there is less sway in the back.  I am sure this is due to the fact that the Villager is on a car chassis rather than a truck chassis, like most other minivans.

Our present Villager has a 2 1/2 year lease.  At first I was disenchanted with our 1999 model as it had  a strong &quot;rotten egg&quot; smell coming from the catalytic converter.  After taking it in for servicing twice with this complaint, I was told that it was a characteristic of the Villager that generally wears off.  Our first Villager did not have this problem.  It took a good six months before it was considerably better.  The strong odor use to penetrate the inside of the car while driving, making my children sick to their stomachs.  Now, occasionally, it will smell when I park it in the garage for a few minutes.  But basically, that problem has been alleviated.

I love the interior and handling of the Villager and will definitely lease or buy another Villager when this lease runs out.  I like the 4-door model.  However, my original Villager came with a lot of extras that are not included in the base model any longer (i.e., lumbar pillow in driver's seat, electric control for moving the drivers seat, anti-lock brakes).  They are now placing these options on the LS models only.

All in all, I give the Villager a high recommendation.<br><br>
