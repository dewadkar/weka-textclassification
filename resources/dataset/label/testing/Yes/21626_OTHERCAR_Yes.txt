            I bought a 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee after quickly realizing how superior the Jeep is to every other &quot;SUV&quot; out there on the market.  I have put my Jeep through almost every possible situation in the Mountains of Montana, and have never been even remotely disappointed.  The ride is nice and smooth (for an SUV) and the All Wheel Drive performs spectacularly on all road conditions.  If you are wavering between the V6 model and the V8, be sure you know what you will be using your Jeep for.  One advantage of the V6 is that it gets better gas mileage.  The difference in mileage, however, does not compare with the extreme power packed behind the V8.  Chrysler made a great engine, capable of towing almost anything you need.  I just drove my jeep from Montana to Florida pulling a trailer weighing over 4500 lbs.  I noticed a minor (1-2mpg) decrease in gas mileage, but no decrease in pick-up and power.  
If you want a sleek, powerful, (somewhat expensive) and practical SUV, I recommend the Jeep.  It is much more rugged and powerful than the Ford and import competition.  It won't let you down!
Oh, and one more thing, I'm 6'4 and easily fit in the front and back seats.<br><br>
