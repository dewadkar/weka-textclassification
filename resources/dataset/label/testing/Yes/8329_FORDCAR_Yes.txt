            I've owned three 1993 Probe GT's.  My first, I bought in 1995 with 32,000 miles on the clock, never gave me a minutes problem right up to the point when it was totalled in April of 2000 with 151,000 miles.  It was still on it's original clutch, which has just begun slipping on hard launches, a few weeks before.  The five speed has amazing power for a 2.5 liter V6.  I'd get plenty of compliments on how good the car looked, and no one believed it was 7 years old with over 100,000 miles.  
After that, I bought a new Mustang, but missed the more corner hungry handling of the Probe, so I found another one, this one with a few more miles, and not in as good of condition, but it was all I could afford along with Mustang payments.  This one had 113,000 miles on it, and although I would never normally buy a car with mileage that high, I figured it could be too bad.  I was right.  I replaced two oxygen sensors for a total cost of $150, and that was all I ever did to it.  Someone offered me more than double what I'd paid for it a few months later, so I obviously couldn't turn that down, so I sold it and immediately bought a black 93 which I currently have.  It's got 86,000 miles on it, and hasn't given me any problems so far, but it's only been about 8 months that I've had it.  
On my first Probe, routine maintenence costs an arm and a leg.  My 60,000 and 120,000 mile service both cost me well over $600 each, and were basically nothing more than timing belt, serpentine belt, and water pump replacements, along with filters, etc.  
Overall, it's a great car I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a fun, practical, inexpensive to buy car.
