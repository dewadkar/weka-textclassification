            I hear a lot about the V6 engine, but very little (almost nothing) about the V8 5.2L (318ci) Magnum. Even the information on this site does not have a listing for the V8. I normally don't find info about the V8 when I go to web sites w/overall info about vehicles. The 92 5.2L V8 is rated at 230 horses (~290 ft/lbs). Basically the same as the new 4.7L.

The 3.9L V6 is junk for a truck this size. 50 less hp and about 2mpg more. But, if you don't have the money, what are you going to do? I can't imagine a 2.5L in there. My brother has a S-10 w/the 2.5L (I know, different companies) with comparable hp and I hate it. It's zippy for a little truck like the S10, but would not work at all for a Dakota. High revin' low horse powerin' no torquein' engine. Not in my truck!

The 92 is the first year the 318 had fuel injection (at least for the Dakota model). I love this setup. No hard staring in the cold or a carb to goof with (though many people like carbs). For the most part this is the same 318 used in all the older vehicles that have a 318. I've found racing-designed transmissions that will bolt right on to the 92 Dakota V8 engine and pistons from a LA-318s that will go right in. 

I own a 92 Dakota LE 5.2L A/T extended-cab 4x4 w/xtra large gas tank, and is hunter green - (I wish it was a stick - more control). I bought it in mid 2002 for $5800 (that included a new windshield and a repaired driver's seat). It had 90k miles on it (pretty low for 10 yrs in these parts - I do 12k/yr just going to work). The paint has worn thin is two places. Dodge was using a water-based paint for a couple of years back then. The original owner blew the tranny in 18 months of towing horse trailers. Probably left it in OD. The second owner had the tranny replaced (under warranty) and had no problems with. I'm the third owner. A couple of mods (low-flow muff, 180 therm, huge K&N air filter) really lets this motor scream. Several more home-spun mods on the engine itself would certainly get you movin'. The mileage has stayed the same at 15 in the city (I don't do much freeway driving - just back roads and dirt - it is Idaho after all). I forget the rear gear but this truck will shift just before red-line and be doing 45mph already - in 1st (it takes about 4 seconds). Slows down in 2nd so it's 0-60 is a little better than average for these trucks (even new Daks w/4.7L). 

Great truck, great engine, remember to use the new factory tranny fluid - extra good something about it and you can't buy off the shelf - yet. It is also the default factory-spec fluid for the current-day trucks (and recommended for the 92 Dakota A/T) . Don't let a quickie lube-shop replace the tranny fluid! Have a dealer do it. They're are only ones with the mandatory good stuff. That all-purpose stuff is one grade below cheap.
