            Strengths: This car is the best car on the earth. The car is 195 HP in AMerica 200 in Japan, that is hard to compete with besides the new Celica GT-S. It has very tight handling, is very fast, looks awesome, and just feels awesome to be in. What I also like is that the car can have a dual personality. While commuting or whatever you can get great gas mileage and have a fairly tame car, if you keep it below like 5000 rpm. But if you feel like getting all your adrenaline pumped through your body and having the best time of your life, you can do that too. The Integra is so incredibly reliable. I haven't had any real problems with it yet, and everything is working great. The seats are the most comfortable I've ever seen, and they really grip through the turns. The trunk is huge for a sports car. Basically, I love everything about this car. 

WEAKNESSES:
With the extremely high demand for the Integra Type R the base price of 24-25,000 has been raised to around 30 in most areas. That is quite a high price to pay for a sports car,for nearly the same amount you can go with a new lexus, or a honda s2000 with leather.Some people may not like the fact that the suspension is really tight. Personally, I LOVE this, but I could definitely understand if anybody didn't like it. Also, on really rough, cracked roads or something similar the suspension can get annoying. Another weakness could be that dealers are making it very hard to get this car for a good price since it is such a rare car (only 750 imported for 2000). I drove six hours to the dealership to get mine. There are also no options. I would have liked to have a sunroof or cruise control, but they are not available.  

SUMMARY:
I have a few friends with this car, and i love riding with them. This car is so recommended its not even funny. If you want a sports car, and you have around $28k to spend, this is the way to go. You get a reliable, great daily driver that will turn into a race car simply with a slight bit more weight on the right foot.
