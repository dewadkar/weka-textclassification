            I drive the <I>2.2L 5-Speed GT Liftback</I> model.  When purchasing this vehicle I first looked at a Mitsubishi Eclipse and an Eagle Talon of the same price range.  Both cars were very nice, but when I saw (and drove) the Celica I didn't need to give it a second thought.
My first test drive I took it up to 100mph and for all I knew I was still at 55.  I actually had to check the speedometer to make sure I was about to top it out at the governor controlled top speed of 115mph!   
Since my purchase 4 years ago the only work to be done is regular scheduled maintenance, a new lower power steering pump tube ($180 parts and labor), and AC - which I still live without.  The car has almost 110,000 miles on it now, and still performs like the first day I drove it . . . actually better due to some small performance mods I have done. 
The only downside to the car is the small back seat.  I am proud to say that I have been able to cram 9 people into the car at one point!  That is another story for another time though
Gas mileage is around 28 in the city, and 32 on the highway.
It is relatively easy to find modifications for the car, even though the car is now almost 12 years old. This past summer I tinted all the windows to 15%, painted the bumper with harlequin paint, installed new fog lights, and interior neons, gave it a new exhaust, air intake, & 8mm racing wires.  My aftermarket alarm doubles as keyless entry and keeps my 2 12" subs and amp safe.  Those things fit in the trunk with at least 3 cubic feet to spare, something totally unheard of for the competitor vehicles I mentioned earlier. I have had at least 5 friends so far this fall ask me if I got a new car over the summer!  Also, whenever I have a new rider in my car and am asked what year my car is, the reply of 1990 is never believed to be a truthful one.  
The ride is amazingly comfortable . . . I once drove from Montana to Southern California (there and back), a 23 hour drive, and stopped only for gas, food, and rest - once each way to sleep for about an hour <B>in the car!</B>  
I really don't think I can say enough about this car to do it justice!
