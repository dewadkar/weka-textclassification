            My dad and mom own this car.  I used to have a Dodge Neon, and my girlfriend currently has her own Dodge Neon.  These two cars are the most opposite in the world.  Here's why:

--Door frames.  Let's start off with the obvious.  The Grand Marquis, like every other car on the road, <i>except</i> the Neon comes with door frames.  If you like a nice quiet ride, get the Grand Marquis.  If you like that open-space, wind whistling into the car, lack of protection if there's a crash feeling, get the Neon.

--The Grand Marquis is big.  I mean huge.  I am a big guy (6'1, 240 lbs.) and I fit VERY comfortably into the Marquis.  There is room to spare!  I could keep right on eating steaks and french fries, and I would just grow right into this car.  The Neon used to be enough for me to fit into;  no more.  They shrunk it down over the years.  It may still be zoomy, but it is no longer roomy.  It never was all THAT roomy, but it was a comfortable fit, like those jeans you buy that you know you shouldn't because even though they feel good in the store, you know that if you gain even one pound, or they shrink in the dryer, that's all she wrote.

--Smoothness of ride:  The Grand Marquis rides like a dream;  smooth as glass.  The Neon rides like a nightmare;  you will feel EVERY single pebble in the road, no matter how small.  The Grand Marquis laughs off potholes.  You never even feel them.  The Neon sinks into potholes like they are moon craters.  If you want a dream-come-true, smooth-as-silk ride, take the Grand Marquis.

--Steering.  The Grand Marquis is a huge car that steers beautifully.  It corners perfectly.  I am constantly amazed that my dad can make the sharp turns that he can make for a car this huge.  The Neon corners well, and steers well, although nowhere near a smoothly as the Marquis.

--Cute extras:  The Marquis' lights turn on when it's dark.  They just know when it's dark out.  They turn off when you leave the car.  

--Trunk Space:  You could fit 3 large dead bodies in the trunk of the Marquis.  If you are starting out in the Mafia, and can't afford the Town Car yet, this is the car for you.  Otherwise, there is PLENTY of room for suitcases and other stuff in the trunk.  The Neon's trunk is smallish; not a whole lot of room.  Two medium sized bags, max, or one dead midget.  

Overall, I love the Grand Marquis.  I would buy one if I had the cash.  Then again, I would even buy a Neon if I had the cash.  But if I had LOTS of cash, and a choice, I would go for the Grand Marquis.  It is smooth, quiet, comfortable, has a nice ride, corners well, has lots of trunk space, and has some cute extras.  It comes with a nice stereo too.  My dad says nobody under sixty would drive this car.  I disagree.  I am under sixty, and would buy one right now.<br><br>
