            We were on a 11 hour trip too vegas in our Windstar. It was GREAT. On inside it had a little <b>back seat control center</b>. With our very own Air Conditioner, Radio, 2 Headphone slots, and retractable seats. Im telling you about the back because that is the only place i sat on this trip. I sat in the very back. I had cup holders, food trays, a little glove compartment. It was great. The seats we had were <b>Cloth</b>

Now for the engines and stuff. It had a powerful <b>V6 engine</b> that goes 50mph in good time, <b>2 sliding doors</b>, 2 push doors, and a big trunk where you open the back. The two very back seats push up for extra cargo if noone is sitting there. 

I hear the newer models need to go to the shop more, but not this one. For some reason they got this one to be perfect.

It has side and front <b>airbags</b> in the front. I found <b>2 cigar lighters</b>, One under the <b>cd player</b>, and one on the side of the cd player in the passenger's seat.
