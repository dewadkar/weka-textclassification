            I wanted a digital camera which would be easy to operated and yet give me the great quality pics that i desired.  Well I sure found it in my Sony Mvc  Fd81.   Wow!  Was my expression at the very first pic that I took. I could see the pic before I took it , as I took it and after I took it and right on the camera itself.  After inserting the battery which I always keep on the charger when I am not using the cam,  all I had to do was flip in the floppy,  look at the viewer, and click the silver button.  The instruction booklet told me that I would get about 10 to 15 pics on each floppy.   Well man  I have gotten no less than 30 on each floppy.
The pics are very clear and well focused.  If by chance the lighting is not perfect, have no fear as on the  Mvc program you can change the lighting factor very easy and brighten up the pic.
Want to get the pics onto your computer for storage and or printing.  Easy !!!  Take out the floppy and insert it in the computer tower.  Voila  the pic is ready to be seen on your computer all 30 of them for each floppy.  From there send the pics to your family and friends as an attachment to your E-mail.  Your computer-less friends can share also.  Just click on print and you got it baby.  Suggest that you use photo paper, glossy on at least one side, for great quality prints.  There,  you have a complete Photo store at home now.  No need to wait to see your prints even one hour.   See them as fast as you can click on your mouse.
The pics may be stored on your hard drive or just kept on your floppy disc to save space in your memory.  Pics are auto numbered for easy referrence back to them.
     All  I can say is   TRY IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT  <br><br>
