            The 1st car I truly owned was a 1984 Nissan Sunny/Sentra I purchased in 1994 at an auction for $2300(NZ).  I needed a new car as the one my parent's first bought me died.  The Nissan blew copious quantities of smoke, the paint work had faded away and the front end had been lightly shunted.  It had 150,000 kilometres on the clock.  I had it for a little over two years and I think the only real maintenance I did was replace a thermostat.  The little car (1.3 litre) just went and went and went, even with some of the usual teenage abuse thrown in.  I drove it practically around the country (New Zealand) with some friends (and 8 litres of oil) and it never missed a beat.  When I sold it and moved to Australia, I owned a big Australian Ford for 3 years.  It was the WORST car I have ever had the misfortune of owning.  Since then I have purchased another Nissan; this one a 1995 model Pulsar/Sentra and am absolutely DELIGHTED with it.  Having owned it for just on 12 months it so far offers 100% reliability (like my other one less the smoke!) and has excellent road mannerisms.  I even like the colour (gun metal gray) with the small mag wheels.  I have driven friends' cars (Toyota Corolla / Mitsubishi Lancer) of similar age and I wouldn't swap it for quids.  Sure it isn't any sports car but its still fun to drive.  I think anyone who wants economical, reliable motoring in a small car should seriously consider a Nissan.  After a 100% success rate so far I wouldn't have any other.<br><br>
