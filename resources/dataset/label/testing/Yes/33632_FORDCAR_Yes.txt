            I remember when I was younger and my brother had what was at the time a new Ford Escort.  Now from what I remember it was not what you would call stylish in the least.  When I turned 16, though, I succumbed to the inexpensiveness of Ford's staple compact, and bought a Escort LX.  Since then, Ford has come out with a much more stylish, and from what Ford says, a car with a much longer lasting engine.  I know my brother had trouble with his after about 100,000.  I have had no serious problems with my car since I have had it, and have had to do no maintenance except oil changes and fluid changes.  One of my only complaints about the Escort is the speaker system.  I am not one who likes my entire car to shake, but I would prefer to hear the words to some quiet songs.  Other than the sound system, I love it.  I love the low gas mileage, and it handles great.  If you are looking for a good car, and would like to save a few dollars, buy this one.<br><br>
