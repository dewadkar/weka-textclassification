            I was a loyal American car buyer until I was on a date with a fine woman who wanted more than a goodnight kiss.  I was sad to see her looking at me like that was it?  Well the very next week I took a test drive in the 99 Toyota Ltd. I wanted it so badly that I drove it home that day.  What do I love about it?  It sits up higher than most cars so in traffic a driver can divert his attention to the finer things.  How about that?  During my summer trips out to the Colorado river in Laughlin Nevada, my new Toy can pull my boat up a hill with the air conditioner on.  Something my Jeep could never accomplish without putting us behind some semi-truck in the slow lane.  It gets better gas mileage than my old 4 cylinder.  With the luggage rack I can put a weekends worth of camping supplies for a family of five.  Who needs a tent when you could sleep in the back?  All you need is a sleeping bag and a place to park.  You could save plenty on hotel rooms on those long drives or dates that don't want to end.  Come on, the only competition is the Jeep Laredo or Cherokee.  Neither have that cool rear window that the driver can adjust to allow the air to flow through.  How about the sun roof?  Try to wash the roof of one of those vehicles without a side step.  CD player cranks,  leather interior rules and that little mirror behind the passenger side sunvisor that lights up will make even a not so hot mama feel like a glamor puss. Even the passengers in back get climate controls.  The tinted windows gives plenty of privacy for long lunch breaks or drive in movies.  I give the Toyota 4Runner 5 stars.  Don't belive me, Take a test drive yourself.  And should you take the plunge, make sure the dealer throws in a Lojack or towing accessories.  The thing will sell itself.  Your better half will love you 4 it!<br><br>
