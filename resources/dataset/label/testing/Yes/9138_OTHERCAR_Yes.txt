                 The new exterior and interior styling changes for the 2000 model of the Lincoln Navigator have made it a must buy for the luxury car enthusiast!
     The new Navigator can come with a satellite navigation system as well as reverse sensors that warn the driver of near objects while reversing.  This is the first truck ever sold by Lincoln and it is a beauty.  It can come with any goodies one would desire, for the right price of course.  The 300 horsepower engine also gives the massive vehicle the feel of a luxury car with all that power that is hardly even audible.  Another new option for the 2000 model are driver and passenger climate controlled seats.  These seats can blow either hot or cold air for only around 500$ extra.   On the amazing 4 wheel drive model Lincoln's control trac system comes standard with three different options by the touch of a easily accessible handle.  This Sports Utility can not be beat by anything in its price range, and a definite must for someone interested in the luxury Sports Utility Vehicle.<br><br>
