            I got this car in October of '03 and it is my first Honda.  Previous car was '01 Pontiac Grand Am SE Sedan.  I'm not versed in all the technical aspects and technical language but I'll do my best.

Exterior:  I'm okay with it.  Based on my own research, I can see where others come from regarding the rear of the car.  It is a bit different, but my focus has always been on dependability and quality.  I'm more of a traditional kind of person, but style is not as important to me.  If I had to say anything, I would say the door handles and rear lights aren't my type of design.  But the general exterior design of the car is cool with me.  I have the darker blue (I forget the factory description), similar to the Pontiac I had.

Interior:  Cloth seats are comfortable and adjustable to my comfort.  I like the leg room and freedom of movement, the extending arm rest and two layer storage compartment, coin holder with slots for each kind of coin, two available outlets for cell phone charging or other devices.  Storage compartment below radio is convenient.  Sunglasses compartment overhead is a plus.  Nice door panel compartments as well though I wish they were padded or had separators to limit the movement and noise of some items placed in them.  I think the panel buttons and features could be a bit more illuminated for night driving.  Not having much luck with the gauge panel lighting...adjusts either too bright or too dim for me.  And as I mentioned that style is not all that important to me, I think the huge speedometer is unnecessary but no real concern to me.  The dash in general for its size seems a little bare and dull other than the gauge panel and radio.  I wish I could get the "trip" reading off the odometer and just be able to access it when needed.  I don't have family, but the rear area is good enough for me if I have the occasional passengers or to carry items, bags, packages, etc.  Glove box rattles and the dealership service dept. says they can't identify the problem...oh well.  

Other features: radio/cd player satisfactory. AC/Heat also meets my needs well...settings keep constant comfort, never too hot or cold requiring frequent adjustments.  Wiper fluid doesn't seem to put out with much force or quantity.  Rear window defroster works well and fast.  Trunk space is more than adequate.  Remote entry and trunk release with panic button are convenient as well as the security coded key/ignition.  I do miss the daytime running and night auto-on headlights that I got used to on the Grand Am though.

On the road: It handles very well on highways/freeways.  Noise is kept at minimum, very smooth ride, responsive steering, feels safe and secure in curves.  Brakes respond very timely and securely.  I have had some brake trouble though and I was informed by the dealership service dept. that there is a bulletin on the pads and the new updated pads from Honda are on backorder (for a month now) so still waiting for them.  As mentioned, I'm not versed in all the technical stuff, especially with engines.  I'm very pleased with the acceleration when driving off from stop sign/light.  Car does seem to sway to either side when its breezy, no strong pulling though.  On local roads, ride can be a bit rough...vibration, interior panel noise, etc. especially if local roads are not in the best of shape.  I suspect a smoother ride if local roads are in better condition.  In general, it does absorb bumps and holes, but their effects are very much noticed at low speed on these local roads.  Mileage is decent; I average about 25-27 mpg.  Transmission seems to shift smoothly.

Conclusion: it is a decent ride for your money.  If you're a person with simple needs, like me, but still want more than say a Civic offers, then the Accord LX sedan will meet your needs.  Being single and mainly traveling about 15 miles one-way to work, it is more than adequate  As soon as I can get the backordered brake pads and hopefully get someone to identify the problem in the glove box rattle, I think I'll be content with this car for years to come (and if the roads ever get improved around here).
