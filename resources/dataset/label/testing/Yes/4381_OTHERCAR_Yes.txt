I have to tell ya, this car has exceeded my expectations at every turn. I moved from CA to CT last month, which of course involved driving all the way across the country in the dead of winter. I drove West to East, so I think about 3 different storms caught up with and passed me. Lots and lots of snow, which I had never driven in before. I managed to find some black ice on the road at about 12:30 in the morning in western Wyoming on I-80. I was doing the speed limit (75) at the time, which was quite reasonable given the dry conditions and the amount of visibility. There was alot of wind however, and when my car found the ice, the wind pushed the rear end of the car around... I tried to recover, but it there was ice for a good long distance... the car was turned 90 degrees to the left of where it should have been, and ended up crashing into a guard rail at about 60 (i'm guessing). It was a long scraping type of deal, and when I got out of the car, I saw my front bumper was no longer where it should be. =) The headlights still worked (on the right side, the left side had shattered) and the car started up perfectly. The anti roll 'pods' had popped up thru the back window, and I now had two holes in the plastic. The car drove all the rest of the way from there to CT with very little repair... just a few fuses, a bulb or two, and a little bending with a crowbar. That's 2000 miles after a pretty substantial accident without a single problem. I got a repair estimate, and the total with parts and labor will be about $8100 and change. They are essentially replacing the whole front end of the car (cosmetically). I'm amazed that given the severity of the accident, nothing mechanical or vital was damaged. I feel that this shows just how well engineered these cars are. I feel all the more safe now, given that I don't have a scratch on me... The car didn't flip over, no glass shattered. This is in stark contrast to many of the american cars out there today that will crumple all the vitals like a sheet of aluminum foil with hardly a blow. Albeit the safety cage is intact, but the car is totalled. _shrug_  I still drive the car to and from work, it pains me to see my darling car without a nose, but it's still perfectly functional. I have to wait about a week and a half to see her all fixed up again, and I must say this will be a long week and a half. =)

I think the repair costs are pretty reasonable, considering the make. I know a friend that has to replace the whole backend of his car (over $9k) everytime he gets into an accident... and he has an Oldsmobile Achieva.

Hehehe. I have a smile across my face just thinking about my car. I bought it just this August, and it's been a little over a month now. Of course I bought the car used, but lemme tell you, with the way it rides, you would never know. People who don't know BMWs ask me if it's new... and that just makes me smile all the more. This perticular model/style (E36) was released in '92 I believe, and ran until '97. I think. The new style is alot more curvy, but personally I think they look too much like a Honda. Serious. I love the E36 body style, it has mean lines that just kick butt. =) This is the first model that has the new headlight lenses which in my opinion is one of the greatest things about this car over the E30 (pre-92) style. This car has class. Don't ask me. 

Anyhow. Enough of that. 

The car I was driving up until the day I got this was a Porsche (912, ack) so I have to say that I know something about how a really well designed car handles. Albeit the Porcshe was old, it had an awesome feel and it had a really nice wide power band. When I first drove this car, I was amazed at how smooth it was. It's not a luxury car in the sense that you could run over a busload of small children and not notice the slightest bumpiness. To the contrary, this car communicates what is going on beneath you. It's extremely comfortable. It's the nearest thing to perfect I have experienced in a car.

I feel strange in that when I think of this car, there isn't a single thing that feels out of place or strikes me as 'cool' or 'different.' Rather, it is the entire car that I love. Not just the comfort of the seats or the simple locking mechanism or the awesome breaking or anything. It just all matches, so elegantly. 

For those of you that want something a little more solid, the car has an inline 6 cylinder, 2.5l engine, with a 5 speed manual transmssion, cruise control, power everything (including the roof!), yada yada. The car came with the optional onboard computer (which has a few nice little features) and the rollover safety thing (don't know what to call it... it's an automatic pop-up roll bar thing). The car weighs a healthy 3500 pounds or so, which to me is actually a blessing. After driving a little Porsche that is flighty at times, this car feels like it's glued to the ground. 

If you're like me and have never owned a convertible, you're probably questioning the handling in bad weather, road noise, breaking in, etc. Well. I've taken it camping for a weekend, and of course it had to rain. The car stood up perfectly well in the rain. No dampness inside, no traction problems on mountain roads, no nothing. I speed too much, and this car only encourages it. =) I didn't feel the car slip a bit going around those corners in the rain. The fog lights are a little bit of a joke, they don't really help that much in the fog. They look cool for normal night driving tho. =) The road noise is way less than my first car, an '89 Toyota Tercel. Ick. This car is QUIET, even at 85, er, 65 on the freeway. Did I mention that the car is perfectly civilized at 120 on the freeway (top down)? Hehe. I had the common sense to at least put the windows up, for fear of a flying rock removing an eye. Heh.

The only thing this car is missing is decent speakers and an alarm. The stock speakers are tiny, and really don't handle bass well. If you're more of a Vivaldi fan, the speakers will be to your liking. The stereo imaging is pretty good, but again, anything with some bass will have you reaching for the mode button. I have bass set to it's lowest setting. Bleh. The alarm thing is more of a personal pet peeve. I work in the downtown area, so I usually leave the top and windows down. Why? I have change in the coin holder. I'd rather people can just lean in and take my change than have to break a window or cut open my top. If they want to cut my seats, they can, but at least they can't cut the top or break the windows. =) Hehe. An alarm would make me feel a little better about it though.   

The last thing I want to mention is the engine. OOh. hehe. I love the feeling of power this car gives me. When I get on the freway, I can take it up over 70 in 3rd gear. The car doesn't complain when I drop from 5th to 3rd to pass someone. Long stretches of road where you're stuck behind an RV just don't happen anymore. Passing is a breeze. Now if people were just a little more accustomed to pulling over instead of forcing traffic to pass them. _sigh_ This car has the best all around balance that I have ever experienced. I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a car from any other manufacturer. Perhaps my next car will be a Z8. =)

Oh yeah. Who should buy this car... Hmm. Anyone that wants a little fun in their commute? People that like to drive, just for the sake of driving. Heh. It's pretty much like a regular sedan, with a little off the top. Comfy back seat (to me), enough trunk space for some baggage and grocceries. I'm 19 and I'm paying for this car _myself_ so I would like to think that it's a pretty accesible car. I am the only one one the loan. The payments aren't any more than you would be paying for a new Mitsubishi whatever or a Celica or a Honda. Who shouldn't buy this car? People with _little_ kids (gets windy in back). People that want to race (Buy an M3). People that would feel guilty for not buying American (I'm supporting my German heritage heh).

Anywho. I love the car. _smile_
