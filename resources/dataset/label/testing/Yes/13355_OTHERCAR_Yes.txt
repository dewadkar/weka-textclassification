            <b>The ultimate police car</b>
I'm personally not a cop but I do have a cousin who works for the county sheriff and his vehicle hat he drives is a 1996 Caprice. He has drove three different police vehicle in the last couple of years including a 1999 Crown Vic. and a 1999 Chevy Monte Carlo. His personal favorite is the Caprice

I recently was able to ride with him and I was impressed with the functionality of the vehicle. It had a comfortable ride, very quick performance (due to the police package, which has a different engine than the passenger model.

These cars are very comfortable to ride in. The interior is very large and plush, which is a nice feature when you spend most of your 8-hour day sitting in the car. The seats are large and very comfortable and you had a large amount of room in between the driver and passenger.

The engine in it was very strong, and a great performer. We had no problems chasing down speeders on the major highway that runs through the county. There is a price for this performance; the gas mileage is not all that great for a car, but the police package includes a higher performance engine than what is included in the passenger model.

The back seat had plenty of room and like the front it was very comfortable. The trunk is also very large and you can store a lot of items without any problems.

The only downside it this vehicle that I could find is that it is rear wheel drive. In most conditions this will not hurt much, but in the winter, which you are driving in snow or ice, you may have trouble keeping the back end from kicking out on you. Also this is a large car, and some people may have a harder time driving it into smaller parking spaces or driving through narrow city streets.

<b>Overall...</b>
I like this car. It is big (which is a selling point for me), very roomy and comfortable, and if you go up to the top of the line model, it may come close to revel a Lincoln. The only bad thing is that this model year is the last that Gm made of the Caprice.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a roomy car that is very comfortable and affordable. Now days you can find good deals on them. It is rear wheel drive and it is a very large car but these are really minor problems that will take a little time to get used to.
