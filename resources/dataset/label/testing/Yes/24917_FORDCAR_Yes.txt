            1999 Ford Mustang GT Metallic Green

[Introduction]
I had 1999 Hyundai Elantra Base 5 speed for three years and I got tired of driving it. I got tired of driving 5-speed and I got tired of bad customer service of many Hyundai Dealerships at Dallas-Fort Worth Area. So, I decided to buy new car: Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, or Honda Civics. Hondas and Toyota dealership would not give good price. So, my choice was a Nissan Altima. One night, I don�t know why, I said to myself �Why don�t I go test drive Ford Mustang?� You see, my previous job at Cyrix, there was this guy who was Ford Mustang Fanatic. He was telling me about how cool it is to own Mustang and how I am a typical �Honda Boy.� I have to admit that I was a typical �Honda Boy.� In fact, I would have never considered buying US-made cars. 

First time I drove Ford Mustang, I was in awe. �Wow, what a car!� From that moment, I became a Ford Mustang Fan. I love driving this car. The car has so much power. Driving Ford Mustang gives me very good satisfaction. The car just goes. I don�t have to press gas hard. This car just goes. Time to time when I drive other cars like Honda Accord V6, Honda Prelude, Toyota Camry, I feel their power lacking. 

[Exterior]
I like Ford�s edge look. I never liked Ford Mustang until this year. Last year�s Mustang looks bit bubble-delicious. It was too bubbly for my taste. But this year, it looks serious and poised. I specially loved the back. My mustang has the spoiler. However, I seen mustang without spoiler, they look like BMW or something to that affect. I like Mustangs without spoiler, so spoiler isn�t �Must-Have.�

[Interior]
I was bit surprised with interior. I expect more from this car. The interior of Ford Mustang did not exceed my old Elantra�s Interior. Center console looks very plain and instrument panel looks like everyday transport. It doesn�t say, �Look, this is what sports car�s instrument panel looks like!� I wish they had fancier instrument panel. I opted for leather, $500. Which is factory installed. You can get dealer-installed leather and it will cost you near $2000. My dealership claimed that dealer-installed leather is thicker and will last long. 

My Mustang doesn�t have sunroof because having a sunroof greatly reduces your headroom. I also thought that Ford Mustang�s sunroof was bit odd compare to say Altima�s sunroof. I just didn�t like it. 

My car has CD and Cassette with Mach460. The sound system is excellent and you can really pump up the volume. 

[Driving]
If you been driving those four door sedans, first thing you will notice when you step into the Mustang�s gas paddle is that how much power the car has. First time I drove it, it had to so much power I didn�t know what to do with them. I remember once when I was turning at the intersection and there was too much power at the end that my car skidded. It was amazing experience. 

Ford Mustang has this distinctive growl. The sound is very authentic. I love it!

The car is surprising smooth for sports car and engine is also smooth for sports car. It corners very well and accelerates very well. This is really a fun car to drive 

[Ford Motor Company &amp; me]

I have very positive view over Ford. I think Ford executes their business better any other US-automobile company. 

Other day, Ford send me a package that has 3 CDs, CD covers, book about Ford Mustang 35-year history and some others. I thought this was good marketing and I like way Ford did this. 

[Negative Points]
Noise is high on highway, therefore 460 watts of stereo is necessary. Like many sport car, utility is very low far as carrying stuff on the car is concern. 

I will give you update on my Ford Mustang Experience

[09/15/1999] : 7.8k miles 2nd oil change
I have not experienced any problems.

[12/01/1999] : 10.5k miles
I went to BestBuy to buy Samsung SyncMaster 700IFT.  However, I did not realize that I could not carry this into my car.  This just doesn't fit.  In fact, everyday I find that many things do not fit into my Mustang.  I called my friend, who has 1999 Nissam Maxima to pick me up.  It fitted into Maxima just find.  Mustang is not shopping friendly.  I wished the trunk was bit bigger and it would have bigger opening.   

[12/16/1999] : 11.2k miles 3rd oil change
Steering wheel was turning bit to the left.  I have gone to the dealership for tire rotation and wheel balance.  This doesn't seem to help.  I am thinking of getting it aligned.<br><br>
