            I have been a ford man for a very long time so I guess that I am a little partial to them,but you tend to stick with what you have had the best treatment with and my ford truck was great to me.I am going to go off on a rant here and tell you that I had a 1984 ford f-150 that my dad sold to me.When he sold it to me it had 302,000 miles on it and when I sold it it had 394,000 miles on it and still running great so that is why I am so partial.Here we go again with the 2000 ford f-150 supercab 4wd.What a great truck.The 4.6 8 cylinder lets you know just how much power that this truck has.The grip traction is solid and the pulling power is awesome.The fuel mileage could be a little better but you cant be to picky with a 4wd.This truck is great for any avid truck fan and for someone who wants dependability out of a heavy duty truck.So, go try one for your self and you will see why that ford trucks are number one.
