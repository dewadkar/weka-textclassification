            Last November I found myself in the market for a new car thanks to an unobservant driver who totaled my old Toyota Camry.  After I finally got the check from the insurance company I went looking.  I originally wanted to by a pickup but, once I saw the new-model RAV4 I was hooked.  I picked one up the day I deposited my insurance check and just love it.

The RAV handles quite well.  Hard to believe that mine is a full-time 4 wheel drive model.  The cabin is very roomy, plus the rear seats fold down, or, if you're really in a bind for room in the back, will come out completely.

Now, the problems:
1) If you're an audiophile like myself, you'll likely be changing out the speakers quickly after buying the RAV.  I haven't gotten around to it yet myself, but will soon.  I listen to a bunch of talk-radio and, quite frankly, the bass is quite unbalanced.  Not to say that I don't like bass.  The problem is that it overpowers the higher ranges if you have the bass set anywhere over "0"

2) The biggie: the infamous dash rattle.  I'd advise everyone to check out the threads over at http://www.rav4world.com about this one.  Somewhere in the dash there's this annoying "clicking" rattle that showed up a few weeks after purchase for me.  It went from happening just when I hit major bumps to a pretty constant companion on semi-rough to rough roads.  I've went to the dealer twice and whatever they've done hasn't been enough to fix it.  From my experiences on the RAV4World message board, this seems to be a "feature" on most of the new 2001 RAVs.  I can drown it out with my radio, but it is still an annoying sound.  I figure that, if this is the only problem with my car, I have little to complain about.  Heck, at least my tires don't explode as I'm driving down the road (which is what I hear happens to some "lucky" Ford owners ;) ).

<B>Update [3/16/01] :</B> There seems to finally be a fix for the dash rattle problem.  I went Tuesday to have a "Noise Kit" installed on my RAV.  It has been 3 days since and I haven't heard the rattle at all.  For you RAV owners out there, tell your service department to install the fix outlined in TSB BD1004.
