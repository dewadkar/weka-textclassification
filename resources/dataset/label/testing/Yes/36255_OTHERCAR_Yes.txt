            I got this car as a gift. When I herd it was a Corsica, I thought "Oh Great!" but when I drove it I was surprised. It drives better than my husbands 95 Civic. I only had a problem with the module. The person who washed my engine got water on it, which resulted in it making the car shake and sometimes stalling before moving. Other than that, the only repairs i had to do was to the catalyst converter and the muffler and this was because they were the original parts. Other than those things the car drove smooth. 

The best features about this car is the comfortable seats, roominess and the V6 engine. The front seats are good enough to sleep in and they make long trips tolerable. The back seats are a little crammed for foot room but just as comfortable. The V6 is the best! This car is capable of running anyone off the road. The pick up is excellent. The car has a lot of power and it won't get stuck in a snow bank. One will also get good mileage out of the tank. I drive from Toronto to Montreal on one tank of gas, which is about 333 miles or 538km. 
 
The cost to ensure this car is really economical. I pay $133.15(Can)and I am a 20 yr old female.

The only thing that I wish was different is the paint job, it's not glossy enough but it still looks good for a 91. My only complaint is that it doesn't take corners as well as the Civic and that they stop making them.
