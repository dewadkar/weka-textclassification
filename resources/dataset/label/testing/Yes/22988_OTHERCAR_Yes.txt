            Tired of film cameras and paying those ridiculous prices for photo development, I decided to buy a digital camera.  After reading about this camera on Epinions.com, it was not long before I went out and bought one.

I love this camera.  I have had it for two weeks and I already have a collection of more than One hundred pics.  The quality of the pictures is very good.  I am very satisfied.  I bought it at Wal-mart for $179.00.  

The software is very user friendly.  Even though the Polaroid software does a fine job of touching up your photos, I would suggest a better program like Adobe photoshop.  Another feature that I really like about the camera is that it does not take long between pictures.  I have tried other cameras in the past and the most annoying thing about them is the time it takes for the camera to get ready to take the next picture. In fact I have returned those other cameras for that one reason.  Another plus for this camera is that the batteries last a good while. 

The camera uses smartmedia flash cards to store the pictures.  The cards can be found super cheap at egghead.com.  They cost about $15.00.  They are 8 megabytes and can store about   44 pictures in high resolution.  Buy about two and you will have more than plenty storage power to gobble up any occasion.      

There is only one thing that was not too great about the camera.  In low light, even with the flash the pictures come out a bit dark.  The camera could benefit with a better flash. <br><br>
