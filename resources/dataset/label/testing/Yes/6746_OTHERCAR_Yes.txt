            First, let me say that I'm astonished that the 1987 Nissan Van is even a category available for comment on Epinions.  It is an antiquated, unavailable automobile.  It had approximately 7 recalls issued, the model is listed in the Black Book, not the Blue Book, due to it's status as "extinct," and mine is still running beautifully.

We purchased our Van (that's what it's called - "Van."  This was, I think, Nissan's first attempt) back in 1987.  My family consisted of Mom, Dad, me and my two brothers.  We were large people, and looking forward to a road trip that summer.  I think it retailed for about $14,000.

The van caught our attention for a few reasons.  First, it looked more appealing than the Volkswagon and Toyota versions of the day.  Second, take into account its features:

* Driver and passenger seats are fully independent, reclinable, adjustable, and comfortable.
* Automotic transmission with overdrive, cruise, intermittent wipers, and blinding headlights.
* Front row tinted moon roof with removable sun shield.
* Cassette deck
* Mini refridgerator, large enough for four sodas and some cold snacks.
* Power windows, with one-touch driver down.
* Power steering, brakes, and side mirrors.
* Second row is two fully adjustable, swiveling, rotating, reclining bucket captain's chairs.
* Second row independent heating/air-conditioning controls.
* Second row power sun roof.
* Third row bench, which can fold down.
* Adequate trunk space.

Over the years, we have taken this van into Nissan for all of the free recall repairs.  However, we never had any problems that were associated.  The a/c always worked well enough to keep cryogenics viable, the gas mileage (about 20 miles per gallon) is still better than most of today's SUVs,  and thanks to my father's dedication, there is not one spot of rust on the body, even though it has never been garaged.

This past week we took the van into Nissan for service.  For some reason, at speeds above 65 mph, or when cruise was engaged, it had this stutter, sort of like mini heart-attacks.  Also, the freon, or whatever the a/c runs on, has petered out.  They replaced the gas line and associated hardware to repaired the stutter (and slight gas leak), and gave us an estimate on the a/c.  The price?  $170.00.  

Of course, we haven't used this van as our main vehicle.  It has about 70,000 miles on it, and has taken us on most of our family vacations.  All regular maintenance is done, and it still hasn't failed us.  This van is now turning 15 years old.  I defy you to locate any of its kind.  It is singular.  All others were either scrapped, traded in, or exploded in transit.

Clearly, this opinion cannot advise you to purchase this vehicle.  You can't find one.  If you do, it's probably a home for raccoons and squirrels in the woods.  But what I can advise you to do it this - strongly consider Nissan when purchasing you next family van.  I don't know anything about the Quest, but it's worth a look if my van is any indication.  Then again, considering all the recalls and problems everyone else had, maybe it's not.

The estimated value of this car today is about $1,000.  To us, it's priceless.
