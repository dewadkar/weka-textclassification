              I found my car in June of 1999 with 89,000 miles on the odometer. The price was right, and I knew the car would be reliable, so I bought it.

OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE...

  My car is a 3-door hatchback.  The 240sx can be had in coupe, hatchback, or convertible.

INSIDE THE VEHICLE...

  The interior is what I consider to be of quality, though comfort is sometimes sacrificed. Panels and trim pieces fit together nicely. Seats are firm (though sometimes too firm on long trips) and fabric is a durable twill-based material that holds up well, though mine has started to wrinkle some I suspect from age.  Side bolsters are supportive and driving position is comfortable for most people, even tall folks.  The tilt steering wheel is far more adjustable that many other vehicles allowing a more precise and comfortable driving position. Ergonomics are quite good with controls placed in logical positions and viewing of the instrument panel remains good at various seat and wheel positions.  The footwell for the driver is a bit snug, it is easy to depress both the clutch and brake pedals at the same time if you have a manual transmission because the pedals are close to each other.  Under most circumstances however, this is not a problem.  Visibility is good but not great.  The dashboard is low, which makes you feel as though you are sitting up high when actually you are quite low to the ground. Automatic seatbelts are annoying, though operation seems okay.  Air conditioner and heat both work very well with powerful fan.  The re-circulate feature is a nice touch.  No cupholders is disappointing.  Interior noise is better than average. However, road noise can vary depending on the surface...never seems to become obtrusive though.  Wind noise is minimal.  All in all, a pleasant environment.

PERFORMANCE...

  The 240sx is fitted with a 2.4L In-line 4 cylinder DOHC engine.  It produces 155HP and 160 lb/ft. of torque, and delivers brisk performance, especially when coupled with the slick-shifting 5-speed manual gearbox.  In addition, the clutch is ultra-smooth and engages easily. This all comes together to deliver a 0 to 60 time of about 7.5 seconds.  Fuel economy remains good with 23 in the city and 28 highway.  Premium fuel is recommended. The multi-link rear suspension is a nice setup too, as it increases stability on roads.  Braking is good with disc brakes, although ABS equipped vehicles are likely to stop better still. Rear drive means good handling, but relatively light weight and short gears make for a slippery situation in wet or snow conditions.  These types of climates are best avoided.

THE VERDICT...

  Solid, well built, and fit/finish is good.  Constructed much better than many domestic rivals and right on target with import rivals (Honda Civic, Toyota Celica, etc.).  Better performance than most rivals and reliability ranks as nothing short of astounding.  At 133,000 miles (over 40,000 since I bought it, the only service has been oil changes, brake pads ($225), battery ($45), and a starter ($180).
