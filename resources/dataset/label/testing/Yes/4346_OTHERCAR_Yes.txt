            My family got a 1998 BMW 328i convertible 1 year ago, and we have discovered its greatness.  With smooth lines, sleek design, and outstanding performance, this 190 horse beauty can really fly.  Our first  time out in my father's new toy was incredible, because of the way our new car could out maneuver and accelerate faster than many other cars on the road with ease.  Not only was this car looked at by others on the road with a gleam, but it also made my father feel younger and more confident.  This car is ideal for people around the age of 35 if they have enough money for it, because it is a wonderful piece of machinery that will make them feel better about themselves and others around them.  I believe that although this car is rather expensive, it is one of the best all around convertibles on the market today.  The only major problem about this car is that it does not do as well in the snow.  The front wheel drive steering slip and slide a bit in wet snow, which is a bit tough for some who live in the northern regions of the US, but if you live in the southern regions, this car is amazing.<br><br>
