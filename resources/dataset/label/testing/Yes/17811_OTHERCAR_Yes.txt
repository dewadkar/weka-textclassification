            Hi folks! I�m back and I�m ready to write about something near and dear to my heart: the 1993 Toyota MR2 Turbo. I bought this car semi-new in 1994 (it was a 1993 leftover) at an auto show Providence Convention Center.

THE PURCHASE
You see, I was at the Convention Center with the former future Mrs. Eviljeff (FFME) to see a Pet Show. We were there to see all the cute critters, as this was a favorite activity of FFME. After we got our share of cute critters and critter accessories, we decided to leave. On the way out, we noticed that Toyota was having a 1993 model clearance in another part of the Center, so we decided check it out.
Of course, they put a MR2 right at the front entrance. I had seen plenty of the MKI style MR2�s (the wedge shaped style), but this was the first time that I had seen the newer MKII body style that came out in 1991. This car had some nice lines, and I was afflicted with a bad case of car lust almost immediately. Of course, the 200 horses of turbo power and 200 ft/lb�s of torque didn�t hurt!
Since I already had a new Mazda MX-3, I was pretty well resigned to the fact that I wasn�t going to get this baby though. When the salesperson came over to start her sales pitch, I was ready to just say �No thanks. Just drooling�. Before I could get the words out, my FFME says �We�ll take it right now if you drop the price to $20K�. The car�s MSRP was $28K. I stood there like an evilidiot with my mouth agape while she started haggling the car�s price. The next thing I know is I�m driving this car home. No concern over financing, budget, or trade�in value of the MX-3. This was a pure car lust impulse purchase. I pretty much decided that FFME was the woman I was going to marry at that point.

THE SPECIFICATIONS
	Okay, I better get back to some real information:
Engine: 3S-GTE turbo producing 200 peak HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque
Transmission: 5 speed manual with Limited Slip Differential
Tires: Yokohama Z rated 195/55 front, and 225/50 rear with 15� alloy wheels
Comfort: power windows, power doors, air conditioning, cruise control, leather seats and trim, T-tops.
Clifford alarm system: very useful for letting one know that Marriedguy�s idiot neighbor has backed into the side of your car, may possibly be sensitive enough to detect impacting beer bottles also
Sound System: 200 watts 8 speaker stereo with individual subwoofers behind each seat, 6 CD disc changer
Other stuff: driver side airbag, fog lights, power steering, ABS
Fuel Consumption: approximately 28 miles per gallon using premium unleaded fuel

THE PROS
The body styling has a classic sporty look. When people ask how old the car is, they are usually surprised because it still looks sporty and not dated.
The engine output as related to the weight of this car is really nice. The car weighs only ~2700 pounds. The MR2 just flies off the line, and the fat rear tires provide plenty of traction to maximize the power transferred to the pavement. I was once pulled over by a cop for �excessive acceleration�. I hadn�t broken the speed limit or spun the tires, but the cop apparently thought that I had accelerated to the speed limit too quickly. Needless to say, I didn�t get a ticket.
The handling of the car is superb. The mid-engine format provides near perfect balance allowing you to scream into turns with minimal loss of speed. This is where I usually cream front engine cars like Mustangs and Corvettes. They do kill me in straight lines though as both of those cars have tremendous power. However, it was usually folks in Saturns who seemed always out to prove something and have to be humiliated. Badly.
One note of caution: do not scream into a tight curve in the Swampanoag Trail at 120 miles per hour at 3 am after eating at Haven Brothers (see anthonyk�s review). Even this car has handling limits and I did several 360�s. (I think I changed a tire faster than Dale Earnhardt Jr.�s pit crew to get the car home that night one step ahead of the law, I AM eviljeff after all).
The stereo system just rocks.
The T-tops are a fun item to have in the summer, although finding room to store the tops in the car can be a challenge.

THE CONS
The factory spec tires on this car wear out very quickly. We�re talking about getting about 12 to 15 thousand miles on a set of 4 tires. Seriously. 
The front tires are slightly smaller than the rear tires and are unidirectional. Net effect: no tire rotation possible and quicker wear. Combine that with the fact that the factory tires are extremely sticky to provide greater traction, and you have a situation where you are buying new tires every year. I have found that Dunlop SP8000�s provide greater wear (~20K miles) at a reasonable price, but they don�t provide the same traction and handling characteristics as the Yokohama�s. Life is all about compromises I guess. 
Storage room is limited. There is a small trunk located behind the mid-engine and some available room under the hood where the spare tire is located. But there is enough room to carry your skeet gun, ammo, and a small Charbroil grill with 20 lb. propane tank. We�re not talking about a family-mobile here.

After owning this car for more than 6 years, I can see it has held up very well. I have driven it in New England winters and there is still no significant rust on the car. Other than normal maintenance, I haven�t had any major engine work performed on the car. If you can find a used MR2, then I would recommend that you give it a closer look. It will definitely give you the best performance for price in a mid-engine sports car.
