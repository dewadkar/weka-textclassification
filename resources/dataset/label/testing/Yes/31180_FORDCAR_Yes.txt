            The opinion on 94&up Mustang is fairly uniform. WE LOVE'em!!! I have owned 3...95 GT, then the 98 GT, now a 95 GT again. The only reason I sold the 98 was to go back to the 95 and the 5.0 engine. I think I will always have a mustang in the garage. For the money, get the convertible GT. Any how every one raves about Mustangs, let's talk about the down side. Insurance: whoa, it is high, it's like a car payment of it's own. MPG: 17/25...I wish try, 13/20 and if you drive hard it will be even less. Convertible Top: It almost never stretches, like some other cars, but the black is tough to keep black, you wash it and it is still grayish, and never use tire dressing (try seat conditioner), it will run oily residue all over the glass and paint. Leg Room: It is good up to about 5'10" tall in the front, then you may want to modify the seat position (easy job, visit mustangworld.com). The back seats are good as long as the driver is short, but if the driver is tall, it will be tight. Trunk: It's OK. Interior: the shift position is fine, but could be placed better. The seat belts are good, but the plastic hooks that hold it out of the way at the shoulder don't perform well, neither do the ones at the base of the seat, by the door. The dash only comes in black, even if the seats are white. Engine: Big issue...check the intake manifold, if it's plastic, it will be leaking now or soon, and it must be replaced with an all metal intake. The bright side, this is a great excuse to do a Hi-Pro up grade, like the GT40 Intake. My fuel pump went out as well. Also, put in a K&N air filter, and remove the air silencer, you'll pick up like 10hp, CHEAPLY! In fact there are many low cost, up grade parts for Mustangs, it's crazy.

Ok that's enough bad talk; I will leave you with this. Mustang is THE American roadster. It is hard to find any one who hates them, young, old, woman or man. This is great for resale. Another FACT, when you drive a Vette, or some exotic sports car, there are certain "ideas" people (women) get about what you may lacking & the car is making up for. Mustang is a hot car, but when you pull up in it, it's not like "Oh, he's trying to make up for something", when you pull up in your Mustang, it's more like,? I can see me in That car, we must have some things in common."
