            This is my fourth digital camera.  My first was a Casio 640x480 back in 1996, then I had two different Kodak's (DC-210 and DX-3200).  Each time I purchased a new one was just to get higher res pics.  I have owned the Olympus C-4000 since December 2003.

The PRO about this camera is great resolution.  You can shoot amazing 8x10 pics with ease.  It has a lot of nice options as well, such as all the exposure control you could ask for, including Program (P), Aperture Priority (A), Shutter Speed Priority (S), and Manual (M) exposure modes.  And a rear LCD display is very nice.  Also has all your basics like Auto flash, self timer, macro mode, and red eye reduction.

Free included components are the Battery, Carrying Strap, Communication Software, Lens Cover, Recording Media, & USB Cable.  I personally can't comment on the software because I use a card reader built in to my HP Photosmart 1115 and Paperport photo-editing to edit my pics.

I feel that the menu system is easy to understand.  For example: changing resolution, quality, even formating the card for quick erase.

The only CON I have is the Smart Media card.  I do not like them... they are flimsy and do not hold as much data as Compact Flash.  As of Nov 03, the most popular Smart Media cards come in 32MB, 64MB, and 128MB cards.  I saw on the net that 256 MB is available but at a cost equal to the Compact Flash's 512 MB.  A 512 MB Smart Media Card has yet to be made.  Compact Flash popular cards are in 32,64,128,256, and even 512 MB!

Maybe one more small CON... when recording small video clips, sound is not available.  There is no microphone so your movie clips (like singing happy birthday) will have no sound, just the video.

Very nice camera but my advice to Olympus is next time design the camera with a Compact Flash Card instead of the Smart Media Card.
