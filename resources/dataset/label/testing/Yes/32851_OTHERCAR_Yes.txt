            I was looking for a new digital camera to replace my olympus d450z, and stumbled upon the 880. What I like best about this camera is the control it gives you over your pictures. You can set the apeture, shutterspeed, focus depth and do most the things that the more expensive cameras do and do it at a much lower price. The camera takes fantastic pictures indoors and outdoors, and the shutter control allows you to take great pictures anywhere without the use of a flash. The auto focus is normal nikon well done. The programming and menu control is simple and layed out well once you get used to it, even though it is quite menacing at first.
On the down side, battery life is horrible. You should buy the lithium ion rechargeable and the charger, which tacks another 100$ to the price, but makes this camera usable. It's a hidden fee that is really a must.
Also, the response with the flash seems a little slow unless you hold down and prefocus a shot. This can be a nuisance, and if you don't anticpate action, you may miss a good shot. This is not a problem shooting in manual though.
I would reccomend this camera to anyone looking for a better camera at a decent price. It has most of the abilities of it's big brother, the 990, at a little price. It's a good camera to grow with, and a good bet for the serious amateur looking for a easy camera to carry, or feel comfortable with.<br><br>
