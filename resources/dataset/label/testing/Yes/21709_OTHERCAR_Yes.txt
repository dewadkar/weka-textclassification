            I just recently rented a 1998 Chevy Cavalier, and I thought the experience is worth to tell.  
The car was a 1998 cavalier, two door coupe, and was actually better than I thought it would be.  I know if you don't live under a rock you know what the cavaliers look like so I will tell you about the inside of the car rather than the outside.
The Interior was nice, it was made out of vinal.  The front seats where pretty roomy, but whoever has to sit in the back of one, I am sorry (the manufactures page says 5 can fit in this car-maybe to adults in the front and three kids in the back).  But between the front seats is a pretty nice center consul, It had enough room for tapes since it had a tape player.  The dash board was pretty big, I am used to my jeep with having barely a dash board.  But on the cavalier the mph and the gas and the temp. guage where the only ones to have a guage.  I personally like having a guage to see my oil pressure.  
Now the trunk was pretty roomy, It held all my luggage plus my briefcase and let me tell you there was a lot of luggage.  
Now the engine, I didn't do to much looking into, but the car has a four cylinder, 2.2 Liter, 120 horsepower engine.  (So it's nothing to race with) and MPG where 24 in the city, and 34 on the highway.
I do recommend this car if you want a reliable rental car for a weekend and the rates where low on it too.<br><br>
