            I have owned my Prius since September '01 and have enjoyed all of the miles that I have put on this wonderful car! I have not had any problems with it so far and I feel that it is the finest vehicle that I have ever owned! It is the only 4 door SULEV (Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle) available and I feel great knowing that I am driving such a truly "green" car. It also gets great gas mileage; my lifetime average is around 46 mpg. BTW, my personalized Arizona license plate is "EZONGAS"!  

Living in the incredible heat of the desert southwest, it is required to have a car with a great air conditioner! In fact, the AC in the Prius is "layered" in upper and lower tiers of circulation for maximum efficiency.  Another energy-saving breakthrough: When the car is stopped, the engine turns off and the AC compressor stops, further reducing fuel consumption. But you can over-ride this feature by simply pushing the MAX AC button on the dash.  This keeps the engine and compressor running so that you don't instantly fry in the 110 degree Arizona heat! 

My favorite feature is the ECVT (Electronically-controlled Constantly Variable Transmission) because it provides seamless power from 0 to 102 mph!  That's right, no shifting!  This also saves gas and creates very little stress on the gas engine, which is detuned from 110 hp (in the Toyota Echo) to only 70 hp in the Prius.  This engine is designed to run for about a million miles, which at the rate I'm racking up the miles should be about another 37 years!!
 
This car is so easy to drive and live with. Just fill it with gas and drive it!  We take the Prius on all of our long trips because of the CD player, cruise control, and exceptional gas mileage. It has easily climbed 10,000 ft. mountain passes in Colorado. The best part is coasting down the back-side of the passes and watching the energy consumption display indicate 99 mpg!  The Prius has plenty of room inside (about the same as my wife's Camry) and a fairly roomy trunk (although some space is lost to the battery pack). Speaking of my wife, she can't wait until the lease is up on her car so that she can get her own Prius!!
