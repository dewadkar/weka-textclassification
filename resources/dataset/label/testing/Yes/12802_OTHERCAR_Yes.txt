            First off. I love my PowerShot S20. But I think some of the other opinions gloss over a few of the minor problems. I bought the camera fully loaded. I have re-chargeable batteries, the re-charger and the 340mb drive. I would never consider any high end digital camera that didn't have: USB connection and a slot that takes the 340mb drive. With the multiple batteries and the 340mb drive I can take 160 pictures at highest resolution, I can preview them all in a tiny package. Now my minor quibbles. I think you need more than one battery. I cannot quite get 230 shots with no preview and preview is valuable. I don't think you can count on more than 80-90 shots without re-charging. But maybe I'm just wasteful of batteries since I have three. Second the manual is poor. I think I'm good at reading manuals and I find it poorly organized. I would not recommend the camera for a technophobe. There are too many modes and settings and the data is hard to find. I would like a mode that allowed for un-compressed images. There are a few times when I want all 3 megapixels and I don't want Canon's JPEG compression, no matter how good the algorithm. 

You need to plan on taking a lot of images to get used to the camera and find out how YOU want to use it. I use it in the manual mode. I can't find any reason not to. But it took me some trial and error to decide to use it this way. By the way manual really isn't manual. It just allows more control over the settings. It took some trial and error to get comfortable with the different flash settings. On balance. You can get very close to the S20 for a lot less money, especially if you can live with 2 megapixels (the Canon S10 for example). <br><br>
