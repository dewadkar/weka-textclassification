            I bought my 1995 Plymouth Neon right out of college. I bought it for the simple reason that it was the coolest looking new car I could afford. Hey, I liked the little oval headlights.

Okay, so you got me, I don't subscribe to CAR and DRIVER. I know and care relatively little about the inner workings of my car. But for all those non-autophiles out there, let me give you the scoop on the Neon. For starters, it is a cheap, reliable car. In the 4.5 years I've owned my car, it has only been at the shop two times.... and one wasn't the car's fault! Which brings me to my next story. In 1996, I was involved in an accident in my car. The air bags deployed, the seatbelts worked, the crumple zone crumpled, the car was a complete wreck. But I was absolutely fine. Other than a small bruise on my left hand (from the airbag) I walked away totally uninjured. Pretty impressive for a compact car. And, by the way, the Plymouth dealership fixed my horribly wrecked car in about 3 weeks, and it looks and runs great today.

There are, admittedly, problems with the Neon, though. For one, it is not a powerful car. It does 0 to 60 in about 15 minutes! Okay, it's not THAT bad, but it is nothing in comparison to the old cars I used to drive in high school (like my 1970 Chevy Malibu with the 350 V8). It also rides pretty low to the ground, so going over speed bumps takes some skill if you don't want to hear that horrible scraping sound your car makes as you scrub the muffler off! It is also really noisy on the highway. The windows don't have a very good seal, and so once you get going over about 50 mph, you feel as though you are a category 4 hurricane. You have to turn the radio way up if want to hear your favorite song in my car on the highway! Now, I own a relatively old Neon. Some of these problems have may have been corrected in the newer models. So, definitely take your new Neon on a test drive on the highway before you buy it.  

In conclusion, though if you are like me, and all you really care about is getting to work on time; if you usually drive only on city streets; if you aren't really wealthy and you want a cute car that can turn on a dime and park in all kinds of marginally legal parking spaces....the Neon is your car!<br><br>
