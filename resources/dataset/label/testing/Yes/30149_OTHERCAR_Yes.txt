            We bought this car a few years ago for something fun to take to car shows and to just drive and enjoy.

Being an older car, it is easy to work on since you don't have all that computerized components.  My husband has rebuilt the motor and transmission and replaced the clutch.  The interior is in good shape and only the carpet has been replaced inside.  The car is bright red and looks great.  I'm surprised the headlights still come up when you turn them on, but this isn't so with the windshield wiper cover�it no longer works.  Seems to have a vacuum leak somewhere.  We really enjoy the car.  It's a car that people look at and think you paid a lot of money for, when in fact it is cheaper than any new car you can find now a days.

Yes, this car doesn't have air conditioning, but you can remove the back window and take the top out.  This still doesn't keep you from getting toasty in the summer though!  

For being as old as it is, I'm really impressed with how well it's held up.  As of today, it is ready to turn over 100,000 miles, so it definitely gets used.  Most everything on the car is original expect for items like the battery, spark plugs and wires, alternator, but these are things that go bad on any car that is been used.  Now a days, to get your car fixed you need to take it to a mechanic so he can plug it into a computer �. not so with the older cars.
