            I purchased my 1992 Geo Tracker, used in 1995.  I selected this vehicle because I was looking for a sporty, fun, small utility vehicle.  The Geo Tracker fit the bill perfectly, plus it is a convertible.

My Tracker has been a great deal of fun, nothing beats being able to put the top down in the summer when going for a drive.  It is compact and easy to park, does not consume a lot of gas and I have found it to be a very dependable vehicle.  Unfortunately, I am one of those individuals that place a lot of demand on a car because of my lack of attention to a maint. schedule.  So much in fact that I did not have the oil changed for the first two years of owning it.  It has never missed a beat!  It now has over 150,000 miles, has never failed an inspection, physical or emissions, has never failed to start, has never failed to get me to my destination.  I don't think I have ever owned a more dependable car.

On the down side, I did not purchase a model that was a 4 wheel drive.  I have found that driving in snow and ice conditions can be impossible with the Tracker because it is so light weight.  The good news is... the few times I have slid into a ditch, it has been easy to get back out.  Also, you do need to be cautious in sharp turns during any driving condition because of its narrow wheel base.  It does clearly warn on the visor of this fact though.

Another down side... I have found that when a part is needed, it is often expensive as compared to more common cars such as Ford, GMC and Dodge.

I would suggest this vehicle to drivers wanting a sporty little &quot;holiday&quot; car.  I would warn though that, because of its wheel base, the driver should be an experienced good driver.  This is not a car for a teenager or a new auto driver.<br><br>
