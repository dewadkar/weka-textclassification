            I bought the 99 Cougar V6 three days ago and I fell in love at first sight.  I admit that my intentions on going to Ford World was not by any means to look at anything but a new Mustang.  However, my plans were changed when I saw a Melina Blue 1999 Mercury Cougar V6 out of the corner of my eye.  It was breathtaking.  My salesman tried to talk me out of it, being under the impression that the car would be way to much for me to handle.  Which made me love the car all the more.
My first bonding experience came when I drove it off the lot barely an hour later.  It handled wonderfully.  Very smooth, fast, sporty, comfortable, everything my 1997 Hyundai Elantra wasn't.  Actually though, there is really no way to describe the full feeling of driving this car, unless you physically get behind the wheel and take it for a spin.  I can promise you won't be disappointed.    <br><br>
