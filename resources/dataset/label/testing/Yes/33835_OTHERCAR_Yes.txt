            This is one hell of a car. Hey, it's a '93 EX 4-door that I have, but it's one of the best cars that I have driven. Many features of the car gives it many high points and appeals to many. In fact, that's probably one of the reasons why my dad bought it for me to drive to school with (I'm only 15 and just got my permit, but I am a very good driver that others might see as experienced and very well-trained compared to others). This model far surpasses that of the other models, even the SE model is challenged by the EX's wide range of features and how the overall feel of the car.

Essentially, I could of either got this car, or a '96 Nissan Pathfinder LE, but my dad and I chose this car because although I am in to SUV's, Honda's have always appealed to me ever since my brother bought a '93 Honda Civic LX coupe in 1992 when he was 17 about 5 years ago. The Accord EX that I bought came from a Honda dealership in Torrance, Ca. The car had standard features along with many custom options because it came with the car and others I asked for (like the 18&quot; silver rims). Basic options included Automatic Transmission, Air conditioning, AM-FM Stereo with CD player, sunroof, and airbags. Custom options included a subwoofer speaker system, rear spoiler, and the 18&quot; silver rims (custom wheels). My car came with 26,000 miles, so that isn't to bad before my first tune-up, which I should also mention that as part of package from the Honda dealership, they included a 100,000 maintenance warranty, so whenever my car breaks down, they fix it free of charge (I don't know what that means because I am I'm not a car literate.).

My car has automatic transmission. It's easy to drive and control the steering. I don't know if Honda still makes their cars with type of quality, but if they do, keep doing it, it's perfect! The internal parts are perfect for the most part. None of them has given me a problem yet. To be honest, the car is definetly reliable. I can take it to my school(which is about 6 miles from my house) and back on a half-tank of gas, and it would stay on half! Talk about a real gas saver. Speaking of which, I pay about 10 bucks about every week and a half before I ever need a refill. This I really like. The external parts of the car are flawless. The coating on my car looks brand new still. The car is easy to clean with a spot of wax and coating every now and then. The sunroof is perfect. I love driving with it up, and my friends love it too whenever I have to give them a ride to school every morning. The headlights are even working well too!

My only complaint for this car is the question I have with every other used car I think about: &quot;When will this car breakdown and become useless?&quot; I love this car so far, and I don't want to give it up yet because I feel that the car and I already have a connection. Buy the car if you are looking for something reliable and looks good in style too. My car cost $9,536 total (including custom options), so I'm sure you can find the very same model at around $5000-$7500 in your local car classifieds. This car is possibly the best 1993 Japanese car model out there.

(UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    I recently got into a car accident and wrecked my car. I recently bought a newer 1997 Honda Accord LX Sedan, so be sure to discard this review and read my review of my new Honda soon)
