            When my husband and I were in the car market for the very first time, we wanted to find the best deal.  We wanted something with great mileage, and that wasn't too expensive.  Since neither of us have children, the size of the car was not much of an issue.  

During our car shopping travels, we kept seeing the Ford Aspire.  The salesmen were always ranting and raving about the mileage for the Aspire.  Once upon a time, I had owned a Chevy Sprint, and did know what a bargain the gas mileage could be with such a little car.  The price for the car was not expensive either. Basically looking for a car that would get us place to place, we found that the Aspire fit our needs nicely.  

We have had our Aspire for a few years now, and the mileage claims have lived up to the raves (about 30 miles a gallon).  Working in a job where I get reimbursed for my mileage, the Aspire's great mileage benefits are helpful.  The gas tank is small, only holding about 8 gallons.  

We have not had any major mechanical problems with the Aspire, and we currently have about 70,000 miles on the vehicle.  I do notice that you really need to be diligent about the 3,000 mile oil changes, as when you hit about 3,300 miles since your last change, you can really hear the car begging for some more oil.  

Downsides to the Aspire? There are a few.  The car is small.  Very small.  My husband and I have made a few long trips in the car, and we both wished we could have more personal space.  If you are a larger than average person ( in width or in length) the Aspire may not be for you.  

My husband and I live in Iowa.  For those of you that have been so lucky to have ventured across Iowa, you will know that the land is very flat.  Being so flat, we never noticed any major power deficiences with the Aspire.  However, we decided to take the Aspire on our vacation to Mount Rushmore a few years ago.   I thought our little car would die on some of those mountains.  We couldn't go faster than 35 mph on some of the steeper ones.  I wondered why I didn't see any other Aspires in South Dakota.....

So if you don't have any children, are looking for a great mileage, and live in an area without mountains or very steep hills (or don't mind going 35 mph going up them) the Aspire can be a great little car for you.  <br><br>
