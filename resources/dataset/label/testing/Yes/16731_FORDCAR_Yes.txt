            I've owned this car from new, and it has been the most reliable vehicle I've ever had. I have very rarely had to have any work done in the 8 years, the worst thing was a cable in the power window that snapped and I had to have the whole mechanism replaced.
I think the interior is very well designed, with most controls close at hand. The seats are comfortable even for long distances. Some of my passengers complain about lack of headroom, but I'm only 5' 2&quot; so it's no problem for me. My major complaint is no cup holders and minimal interior storage space. The back seat is too small to take adults long distances.
This version has a 3.0 liter V6, and I have a manual transmission. The car shifts smoothly and has lots of power. As seems to be typical in my experience of Fords the heater takes a while to kick in but eventually is fine.
I am now reluctantly considering buying a new car, partly because this one is reaching the age where things may start to go wrong, but mainly because I need to have easier and roomier back seat access than I used to. I've been thinking that way for over a year now, but I haven't done it because I can't bear to let this car go. I bought this car in a moment of middle-age, kids-grown-up madness, but I've never regretted it, it has been fun.
