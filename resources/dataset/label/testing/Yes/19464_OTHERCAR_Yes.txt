            (Here's to hoping my readers don't consider using my own words more than once on similar items, to be a form of 'cheating'. I hope you will understand that I carefully researched each of the items reviewed in this series, but that there are many similarities in the product line.)

As I said before, I am on a digital camera journey. I am going to review several of Sony's digital cameras in an effort to educate myself and my readers. I am in the market and if you are reading this, I assume, you are in the market for a digital camera too. These reviews will cover everything I can find on the Sony digital cameras available. This is the fourth review in this series. You can see previous reviews at:

This camera runs about $700.00 I found the MVC-FD73 to be really easy to use with it's 3.5 floppy. I am sure I could even make it work with my mother's old computer. That would really be something! 
Although the quality of the images doesn't rate up there with the DSC series, for the money and ease of use, this is a very nice unit. I am using a 266 G Gateway computer, about 2 years old, and I am sure if I had seen one of these babies 2 years ago, I would never of gone through 5 scanners! 

I don't think I will (at this point) ever buy another scanner again! I get a kick out of storing my shots and having the immediate gratification offered by the slip of a disc (pun intended) into the floppy drive! I can't even tell you how much time I feel I wasted over the years building web sites! Scanners were always a huge problem for me. I think they were all &quot;out to get me!&quot; Now with the MVC-FD73 there are NO cables to hook up, and there is no hardware to torture me!
I like the DSC series better as I said before, but I was really pleased with the ease of use and the price of the MVC-FD73. 

Stay tuned for more reviews on Digital cameras from Sony Digital Imaging!
