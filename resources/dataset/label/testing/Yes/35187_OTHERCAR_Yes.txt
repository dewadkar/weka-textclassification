            My interest in this marquee started out with the earlier Range Rover Model.  I was quite interested in acquiring what had been dubbed the &quot;The most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world&quot;.

However, I was left with a lot of doubt as to the credibility of this rather desirable automobile.  First reason for doubt was the Range Rover's dubious and rather shameful reliability.  This so called competent mud rucker had not endeared itself to owners all over the world with it's dubious track record on reliability.  In fact, as I was hunting around for a bargain basement used ( or as we say now...), pre-owned Range Rover, I found myself being deterred by - of all people - car dealers all over.  I then went to a trusted friend in Studio City to try to acquire this vehicle that I desired.  He bluntly refused to sell me the one he had actually owned, this from a guy who treated his automobiles almost as a substitute for children.  He regaled me with horror stories of trying to keep his Range Rover serviceable, infact he stated that he would never buy a Range Rover that was out of warranty.  

So, after feeling rather let down in my quest to acquire this automobile, I was to come to face another issue I had with the Range Rover.  For an over $50,000 luxury automobile, it was small inside.  I am 6'3&quot; tall, and can compete with most professional quarterbacks for build.  I was rather disappointed by this.  I don't know about you, however if I am paying that much money for a car, I would like to be able to enjoy it... and I mean really enjoy.  I am not just acquiring the Range Rover to prove my social worth or accomplishments, or to say that I appreciate crumpets and tea or a game of Polo.  Also, it was not to grin in pain at my neighbours as I come home from LA's infamous traffic jams with my knees having lost all sensation by the time I come home.  However, almost like a call to me from the Marquee's manufacturer, a second edition of the Range Rover was released.  This was the Range Rover Town and Country LWB (Long Wheel Base).  I found from test driving this car that there was more room for Daddy Long Legs - Me, at last it seemed I would be able to enjoy this luxurious marquee.  However, based on the dismal reputation that the Range Rover seemed to have built thus far, I found my desire to acquire this vehicle was not enough to make me fork out the mulla to buy it.

The beginning of this review was based on the past.  Rover has now introduced the new Range Rover, and it has been with us for a few years now, fewer years than our cousins in Queen's country have had the new Range Rover.  I have again found my desire for this majestic mud rucker piqued.  The new Range Rover now has a fair amount of pre-owned examples to choose from, therefore I decided to again go out and try to quell my desire.

Initially, I was not too taken by the look of the new Range Rover, it somehow seemed bland in design.  Almost as generic as a lot of new automobiles seemed to be during the late eighties into the nineties.  However, as time went on as I started to pay a closer look at this marquee.  I realized that Range Rover had actually created a new Range Rover while preserving the traditional look and dare I say lines of the older model.  It was more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary.  As time wore on, I also realized it was actually distinguishable from other SUV's on the road, if you did not recognize Her Majesty's official mudrucker by it's new design, then I found you could hardly miss it's share size.  It had presence and visual dominance on the road when it appeared, and at the same time, it exuded it's elegance and class.  I often joked that it was what a Suburban would look like in a tuxedo, it was James Bond on steroids.

After deciding that the new Range Rover had a face that not only a mother could love, but one that I had come to appreciate.  I decided that it was time for me to go put it through it's paces.  Now what I wanted was to be able to spend a bundle of hard earned dollars on an SUV that would make me feel like royalty...(forgive the pun).  But this vehicle had to be reliable enough to where it would need a third mortgage to maintain - the second mortgage bought it.  It also had to be comfortable enough as a long distance hauler and a traffic jam haven.  Now, I did mention the part of feeling like royalty, well, no doubt a lot of people will say this is a trait of and Angeleno, but I wanted my SUV to have enough snob appeal to say class without being ...to crass.  

I first began my quest by researching the new Range Rover's reliability.  Much to by delight, it was rave reviews all the way.  Things like &quot; I have been delighted with the performance of my Rover to date&quot;, and this would be two to three years later.  Or from my dear friend in Studio City, &quot;I am glad that I decided to try another Rover, for once I did not have to wear out my warranty&quot;.  So with this positive feedback already on the side of the new Range Rover, I went in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage.  I also went to a couple of large Range Rover dealers to see if I can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car's reliability.  Even though I was expecting to get somewhat biased reviews, I was still pleased to hear that the car was indeed proving it's reliability.  

When I went out in search of my ideal candidate, I was quite in amazed at the number of Range Rovers available to the used car buyer, and also the asking price for them.  To say that depreciation was rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me.  I found quite a handful of Range Rovers ranging in age between 18 months to two years old.  The average mileage was between 38,000 to 50,000 miles.  To me, the examples I found were quite clean and well kept.  After all, the truth of the matter is that not all of us can afford these marquees new.  The prices I found ranged from $32,000 for newer ones with lower miles to $29,000 for slightly older ones with mileage in the high forties to fifties.  I thought this was not a bad deal, considering this meant up to $20,000 less than a new one, and they still looked in impeccable condition.  Even the examples I found at the larger Range Rover dealerships were only a little bit more expensive than the ones I found here and there.

A BIT OF THE OLE WRITER'S BLOCK HERE.  SINCERE APOLOGIES, I WILL FINISH THIS SOON.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.
