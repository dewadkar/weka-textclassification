            I have always loved the unique look of the Jetta.  It stood out on the road and you knew exactly what it was.  I almost bought a used one in 1989 but opted for a new Japanese car for the same price. <br>Now, eleven years later time to buy my Jetta.  No!!!  What happened!  They changed the style!  As the salesman stated &quot;to look more like a BMW/Mercedes mix&quot;.  I didn't want something that looked like something else.  So I looked at the used ones.  There she was.  A 1998 champagne colored, sunroofed dream, right in front of me.  Beautiful, classy, fast on the road, very large trunk and going to be mine!  <br><br>Oh no!  It is three months later (I don't even have my plates yet) and the drivers side dashboard jitters so much I have to hold it sometimes.  The fuse box panel underneath has fallen off more than once while I am driving.  Hold a soda in the built in holders?  No, they don't fit.  The plastic molding around the passengers seat is broken.  Its sort of like a bunch of plastic pieces that don't really fit quite right.  Almost forgot, the brakes!   Plan on getting used to hearing them as part of your daily drive.  The service man said it was very common for VW's.   I recommend that you buy from a dealer because you are still eligible for the warranty.   <br><br>Okay, driving it is great.  I have to drive long distances often and it is a fun car to be &quot;cruising&quot; in.  She works well even with the air conditioning on.  Yes, I have my dream in the garage.  I also have my eleven year old car on the street.  I am waiting to sell it just in case, who knows what will break next...yes...I have the Jetta Jitters.<br><br><br>
