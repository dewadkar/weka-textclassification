            I bought this vehicle because it won top van of the year, was reasonably priced, very roomy and comfortable. This van also offered built in child safety seats. 

But, unfortunately, this van has had more problems than an older vehicle that I have.  I have already had to have the whole engine rebuilt. The air conditioner has broken 4 times and now needs to be replaced. The paint just peeled off the car in sheets.  To be quite honest this van has also been very embarrassing to drive with all the squeaks from the belts and who knows where else. No sooner do I fix one squeak there is another. 

Yes, this car was inexpensive and yes, it is comfortable to ride in, but, if you cant drive it, what good is the comfort. I must say that I do like the break system though. The van stops on a dime. 

I would NOT suggest the purchase of this vehicle unless you don't mind being embarrassed and in the shop all the time putting out more money than you saved on the purchase of this van.<br><br>
