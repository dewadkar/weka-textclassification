            The 2001 Honda Civic is a nice, neat, clever little car.  It is an all new model with enhancements that further highlight increased interior space, driver enjoyment, and overall refinement.

The 2001 Honda Civic has similar dimensions to the 2000 model, but now this car is included in the �compact class� with an interior volume of 1043 cubic feet.  This car now feels more substantial in the space side, which is always good nowadays.  Furthermore, the 2001 Civic�s trunk can now accommodate 4 very large (60 plus centimeter) suitcases.  NICE!!!

The 2001 Honda Civic meets ULEV standards with an increased displacement (up to 1.7l from the 2000s 1.6l) and higher power output.  With this definite improvement in performance and emissions, all 2001 civic engines are also more fuel efficient.  (Like the engines weren�t skimpy on fuel already!!!)

The automatic transmission is a new unit with better/smoother shifts that are altogether more energy efficient.  The  shift lever even looks more contemporary.  (Details, details!!!)  The 2001 Honda Civic� new 5 speed manual also features shorter shifts, with less shift effort.  It should be noted that this tranny is also definitely much smoother than the previous one it replaces.

The materials used in the interior of the 2001 Honda Civic has also been upgraded, and improved upon.  The interior now features larger seats, bigger cupholders, and slim moon roof design.

In addition there are also beefier reinforced structural sections that give better tortional stiffness.  These structural improvements reduce the overall vibration and harshness of the Civic and make it a quieter and a more refined car.  The car really is quiet on the freeway, and even more so just crusin� about the city.

The 2001 Honda Civic also features all new suspensions in both the front and rear.  These new designs provide better handling and a more comfortable ride.  This is easily recognizable to my younger brother�s 1999 Civic.

The new MacPherson strut front suspension with a centralized steering gearbox is a nifty design.  It allows longer, higher mounted tie rods.  This high positioning allows the 2001 Honda Civic improved toe-in and toe-out control.  NICE.  The rear suspension duties are now handled by a new double wishbone design for an overall improvement in ride quality.

The safety engineers at Honda got there say in the final design also as witnessed by the car�s increased/latest safety technology.  The 2001 Honda Civic now comes with an advanced dual stage air bag inflator, 3 point seat belts for all seating positions and an �advanced� seatbelt pre-tensioner for the driver and the passenger.

Overall, with the introduction of the all new 2001 Civic, Honda has again raised the bar in the entry class vehicle.  Which is an amazing feat considering not many companies really pay attention to their entry-level cars.  At least it does not seem that way.

I guess what I am trying to convey here is that it is nice to know that just because someone is on a budget, it does not mean that they have to compromise much in the way of safety, or overall refinement in an automobile.  (At least Honda does not think so!!!)
