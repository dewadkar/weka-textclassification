            I bought this car because I didn't see very many of them on the road. I was driving a Honda Accord before my SVX. Everyone would stop me and ask me what my car was. It was beautiful. When I took my test drive it was pouring down rain. I did not slip or slide around corners. This car did not lean at all, it was like I was driving on bare pavement. I love the leather and suede interior. This was simply the best car I had ever drove. I was hooked, I loved my car. I bought it in Sept. of 97. I had to replace the starter, and the transmission began to slip in 98. The transmission was replaced, but it took my dealership 2 weeks to get the transmission. Because the SVX is no longer in production, the parts are usually a special order, sometimes from Japan. I have also had to replace some electrical switches. These are very expensive from the dealership, so I have tried to find them at a wrecking yard. I always have a very hard time finding parts, usually have to use a parts locator and even then they are pretty spendy..

I have drove this car in the snow and couldn't believe the handling. I felt very safe and secure in this car.


Yesterday, September 19th 2000, a guy ran an intersection as I was traveling 45mph. I had no time to stop. The next thing I know my air bag deployed, and my 3 year old daughter was in the back seat. I always thought if you hit someone head on you would be seriously injured or dead. But I was fine, except for the bumps and bruises. I couldn't believe it. The guy I hit was in a Full size Dodge extra cab pick-up, the collision flipped him upside down. He is OK too. The front end collision to my car made the engine drop down. The SVX motor is in sideways and is designed to do this in a front end collision. This car is built so well I had no interior damage, and because of the well contured seats I sustained minimal injures. The firemen said I walked away from this accident because of my air bag, and the way the engine exorbed the damage. My car is totaled!! But, it saved me from serious injures. If I was in a car that did not have these features, I would be in the hospital right now. My daughter is ok too, she was just shaken up.

I would highly recommend this car if you can find one. If you buy one from a dealership I recommend buying the extended warranty, the transmission for my car was $4000.<br><br>
