            I'd be very surprised if your working-horse Odyssey, favorite Honda Civic, Accord, Prelude, CR-V and even your Acura were not part of this massive recall.  As for my wife and me, our Honda is just messing up in the garage.  Not even the alarm is working.  No wonder.  Are we going to get some repair refunds from the company for all our headaches?  Find out more.

Minivans have become so commonplace these days that they can be spotted everywhere on our roads, freeways and highways.  They are providing the bulk of our transportation needs for our families.  They even contribute to the coinage of "Soccer moms" transporting their kids to various activities such as baseball, soccer etc.  They keep an eye on what's going on in their community.  At the start of this Summer season, many families will be using them up and down our major roads because they are so reliable and convenient.  Honda has long joined the bandwagon with its popular Honda Odyssey.  
<b>No one expected this brand new vehicle to have this type of faulty ignition switch which could cause the engine to stall.</b>  Where is the Honda Motor Co's legendary, standard quality and craftmanship?

<b>Why do I care about this recall?</b>

Just a few days ago, I rented a Honda Odyssey from a rental company while my truck was being worked on.  I was having all kinds of trouble coming back to town from a long trip to the country side.   I thought it was due to some other problems.  But now I realized it had to do with the ignition switch which made the engine stall.  

Furthermore, I have been using Honda vehicles ever since I can remember.  Even when I was in college, I could suspect that Hondas unlike their major competitors were more inclined to having faulty ignition switch issues.  Imagine having to spend hundreds of dollars at a time when  you are living on a quasi-inexistent budget.  For sure, it was tight.  I have also known a few guys who were puzzled by these problems too.  A friend of mine ended up selling his Honda Accord and replace it with a Chrysler Sebring instead of having to shove more money down the tube.  My two previous Hondas had the same problems.  For a long time, we never figured out that it was more of a pervasive problem that would ultimately catch the attention of the popular American Honda Motor Co.  When too many consumers start complaining, they finally hear their cry.  

<b>The company is recalling 1.3 million Honda and Acura vehicles to replace the faulty ignition switch that can cause the engine to stall.  The recall involves Honda Accord, Civic, Prelude, CR-V and this model from the 1997-2000 model years</b>

<b>Anyway, what's good about the 2000 Odyssey?  How does it stand against its major competitors?</b>

Should we come down hard on the American Honda Motor Company now that we know what's wrong with our prized Hondas?  I don't think so.  For far too long, the company has been giving us all things we look for in a vehicle.  A Honda lasts for ever.  That part is still true, but not without any headache that is nothing of our own doing! If this etat de chose continues, the company may lose credibility in this crucial market segment.  For many years, it has dominated the small cars market.  If they don't watch out, a company such as Hyundai may set out to score huge on Honda.  With the recent Hyundai Sonata making waves and turning heads on our freeways, Honda'd better watch out.  (Please see my review on the Sonata at this address:   <a href='/content_61365259908'>http://www.epinions.com/content_61365259908</a> ).  If we talk about the Toyota Sienna, Chevrolet and Mazda, we can see the competitors are not playing around.  They are rolling out minivans that are sturdy, reliable and energy-efficient.   

<i>Remember that the 2000 Honda Odyssey came in two models, LX and EX</i>

<b>Features of both models</b>

The 2000 Odyssey's two models come equipped with features such as standard antilock brakes, immobilizer theft-deterrent system, dual air bags and power windows.  You will also find the power door locks, the cruise control, retractable center tray table with sliding extension, sunglass holder and rear window defroster, power dual sliding doors and automatic climate control.  Bear in mind that 6the EX model has the optional navigation system.  Imagine that you are new in a town.  You don't where to find the nearest bank and restaurant.  Don't worry because the the onboard navigation system uses a global positioning system that can provide you with such services as location and velocity as well as map directions to the gas station and ATMs etc.

<b>How do I feel when driving a Honda Odyssey?</b>

There is no doubt that you have come to expect a lot more from Honda when it comes to the interior space.  As a tall guy, I did not have any problems with fitting my frame behind the steering wheel.  I had enough head and leg space.  The driver's seat is very comfortable.  The passenger's area is quite spacious.  

<b>Customer Satisfaction</b>

Reliability and dependability are some of the bonuses we have come to expect from any Honda vehicle.  For the most parts and despite the occasional headaches, I have been satisfied with my Hondas.  I just hope that the company will be more forthcoming and prompt in informing us when something is wrong with the cars we love so much.  After all, we are making a long-term commitment with them by paying for something we expect to use safely and reliably.
No matter how mad my wife may be over the ignition swith issues, our trust in the company is not going to vanish over time.  With frankness and honesty, they have been nice to us.  We only hope they maintain their high standards and leadership in the market.

<b>What can you do to help your buddies out?</b>

<i>Use word-of-mouth or e-mail this review as soon as you can</i>

Not too many people know about this massive recall!  If you know a Honda owner, let them know.  Even my wife did not believe at first when I told her there was the above-mentioned recall.  Based on the rather short length of the article in the newspaper, many people may miss it.  Just go ahead and pass the word out!  Consumers don't have to keep spending more money for something that manufacturer is responsible for.  It's their problem.  They should fix it and even choose to reimburse us for all previous repair costs as long as we can show proof or provide a receipt.

At least, they want to fix the problem for now.  Let's just let them deal with our Honda!

Nota Bene!  My wife called our local Honda dealer this morning.  The clerk said to give him some time to process the information and make arrangements for all the recall calls they will be getting.  The clerk promised to get back to us.  I will call tomorrow about the same issues too.  I won't stop until they give me an appointment for the repair!
