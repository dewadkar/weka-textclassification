            I take very long road trips on a regular basis.  I have driven my Chevy S-10 from LA to Chicago and back on my way to Tijuana through San Francisco.  That's a long drive.  I thought the plain foam bench seat and the lack of cruise control was going to drive me crazy some time between Des Moines and Omaha.  However, it wasn't until I made the same trip in a BMW 325i that had cruise control and a nice leather bucket seat that I really came to know Hell.  The ergonomics in the Chevy are MUCH better thought out and executed for a 6'2&quot; 210lb man.  The whole 3,000 mile trip in the Chevy my back never hurt, and my neck never hurt.  Of course, I also couldn't have gotten a speeding ticket with that girly little 4-cylinder &quot;engine that could.&quot;  It was a little tough watching ten year old Subaru economy cars flying past me on the way up the Colorado mountains.  
The gas mileage was OK, I figure I get somewhere in the neighborhood of 20mpg between the city commuting I do every day and the five hour highway drives I do two or three weekends a month.  
Make sure, if you are planning on purchasing this truck, that you keep the original jack that comes behind the passenger seat.  You will need it to get the spare down from under the bed.  It's got a special tip that fits into a socket which you use to lower the tire.  I found that out the hard way one weekend, and I had to wait until the dealership opened on Monday to get my tire changed.  
It's a more comfortable truck than I originally gave it credit for.  My visibility is good, it's very simple and inexpensive to fix, and I have managed to put 45,000 miles on my 98 before I had any repairs bigger than a bad turn signal bulb.
