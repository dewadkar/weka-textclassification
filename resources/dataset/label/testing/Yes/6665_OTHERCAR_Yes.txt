            On August 8, 2000, I moved from Brookhaven, NY to Anchorage, AK.  On August 9, 2000, I bought a 2000 <b>Chevorlet Tracker</b>.  I'm still debating the intelligence of making the big move, but I'm totally thrilled with my decision to buy a <b>Tracker</b>.

My <b>Tracker</b>, Antionette (I call her Tony for short), is midnight blue with 4 doors.  It isn't a convertible or ragtop, and I don't have power locks or windows.  It has 4-wheel drive, power steering, a nice little stereo system, air conditioning and an automatic transmission.  I get about 300 miles to the tank.  Plus, it looks really cute.

When it's icy, my <b>Tracker</b> has a tendency to skid, regardless of how slow I'm going.  I must admit, I get very nervous when I drive in icy conditions.  I've never skidded like this with my <b>Sentra</b> back in New York, unless I was in a blizzard.  Well, it snowed about 6 inches yesterday, and I drove in these conditions today.  Of course, I used 4WD.  I didn't skid at all!  For some reason, the <b>Tracker</b> handles a lot of snow better than just a little.

Of course, there's always the fear of flipping if you take a turn too quickly.  Every now and again, since I'm used to driving a little sedan, I feel like I'm going to flip.  But, this is something that rarely occurs. 

Buying my <b>Tracker</b> is the best thing I've done since I've been here.  I haven't had any problems at all.  My only beef is when I look over my shoulder to see out the rear window, the head-rests in the back get in the way.<br><br>
