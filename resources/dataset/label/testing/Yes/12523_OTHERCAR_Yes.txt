            I had been a loyal Nikon customer, including my last digital camera (Nikon CoolPix 950).  I decided to upgrade to the 5+ MegaPixel range, and was torn between the Nikon, Sony, and Minolta cameras.  After doing lots of research on these three cameras, I ended up with the Sony for the features it offered, and the clincher was the true photographer's lens:  Carl Zeiss.  Those who know lenses know that Nikkor and Zeiss lenses are rarely surpassed.

Let me say the camera has turned out to be a delight.  For those who truly enjoy photography, this camera brings back the traditional "feel" of a REAL SLR camera, with all the added benefits of digital.  All the features one could want are included and there has not been a picture yet I have not been able to take by overriding everything and going manual.  At the same time, for those that are not fond of manual photography, the auto functions on this camera make shooting pictures as easy as point-and-shoot - LITERALLY!!  My wife is one that was upset about me buying a camera this complex.  To her surprise and amazement, she has taken quality photographs by simply pointing and shooting.

Night images become a breeze with the Holographic AF function.  A patterned laser is broadcast on the subject that the camera uses to focus.  Once focused (a split second), the picture can be taken.  The night vision capability is also incredible, allowing pictures to be taken at night in total blackness (although all color is lost).  There are various methods for using the combination of flash/no flash, night vision, and holographic AF that makes nearly every shot possible regardless of lighting conditions.

The battery is incredible.  I always carry an extra battery just in case, but have rarely had to pull it out.  The battery literally goes all day, with something like 250 minutes on a full charge.  The viewfinder on the camera is LCD so it runs off the battery.  The large LCD screen on the camera body's back will drain the battery a little more, but amazingly little.  We cruise alot, and when we are in port all day, the first battery typically does the job for us all day.

I can't say enough about this camera.  The quality of the images we have taken is phenomenal.  Do not let the odd shape and design lead you away.  It becomes very familiar very quickly, and the great shots you bring home will make you proud to own this unit.  I don't know what changes Sony has made on their end, but the products they have put out lately are superior to most of their competitors.

Most sites appear to be listing this camera in the low 700's.  SHOP AROUND!!!  This camera can be had for far less.  I spent a day shopping around and found mine for $625 brand new (not refurbished, returned, used, or anything else.  Brand new.  The deals are out there; find them.

Great camera, great value.  About the only way to do better is to make the significant leap into the $5,000 camera lines.  For me?  Out of my budget!!

Good luck!
