            I decided to purchase a digital camera for business/personal purposes. I build custom decks and figured that it would be easier to e-mail picture's of my work to potential customer's rather than driving to their house. Not to mention the ability to send picture's to friends and family living out of state.

The first thing I did was to visit the local electronic's stores to see the camera's in person and to price them.

The next thing that I did was online research. I checked the manufacturer's websites for the models that I had interest in.
When I had it narrowed down to several models I checked with Streetprices.com for the best prices that they had listed for my preferred models. I was able to find lower prices for each of these units online rather than from a local retailer. 

The next step was to search for reviews on these camera's. Unfortunately for me I was not familiar with Epinions.com at this time. I did find Steve's Digicams.com. They give extensive reviews on many of the digital camera's available and were instrumental in helping me to make my final decision. The Canon Powershot Pro70 was the one for me.

The price range I found on this camera online was from $625.00 to $999.99.
My next step was E-Bay. I spent 3 weeks watching to see what this model's average selling price was on this website.

I was fortunate to purchase my camera (brand new w/ full manufacturer's warranty), for $550.00 from an honest E-Bay seller.

I am not going to go into all of the specifications on this product as I feel that the other reviewer's have already done an excellent job going into great detail on this subject.

I will say that I could not be happier with this camera and the outstanding quality of the pictures that can be taken with it.

Anyone who takes more than 20 quality pictures at a time will need more memory than what is available with the supplied 8mb compactflash card included with this camera. This goes for any digital camera.

I got lucky and found a 170mb microdrive unit for $50.00 online. With this I can now take up to 475 quality pictures without having to erase or download any of my shots.

This camera is a easy to use after a little time spent reading the owner's manual. Once again the picture quality is awesome.

When I showed picture's to different people the first comment they made was, &quot;You must have a great printer&quot;. Wrong. I was printing off of the printer that came with my computer 3 years ago (Compaq IJ2000).

Two days ago I purchased A Hewlett-Packard Photosmart 1215 ( I will write a review on this printer soon)! Now I have really great prints that look as if they were taken from an expensive 35mm camera!
Anyone that is serious about their photography will really appreciate this camera.<br><br>
