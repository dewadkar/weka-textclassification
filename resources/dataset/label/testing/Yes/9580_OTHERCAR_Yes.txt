            I drove around the new 2000 Toyota Celica Gt-S and found that it is indeed powerful, but for me, not powerful enough. The 6-speed manual is a good way to go if you want to have a lot of fun driving it. For the lazier people, you can go for automatic with the Sportshift feature that works like a stick shift, but reacts slower to gear changes. I like the acceleration on the 180-horsepower model but 1.8L engine somehow decreases performance. For the speed demons, I recommend the &quot;Ultimate Celica&quot; which is modified the TRD (Toyota Racing Development) themselves! This car may have a small 2.0L engine but it packs a punch with 500 horse power! (Yes! 500!) The car also includes an overwhelming body kit which makes it stand out in front of all the newer cars! A MUST HAVE on the Ultimate Celica!<br><br>
