            In addition to their infamous problems of thirst and girth, today's sport-utility vehicles are mechanically challenged in two additional areas. 

One: Suspension is always a compromise, owing to their on-road/off-road, pavement-hugging/sod-hopping, grocery-carrying/lumber-hauling multiple personalities. Thus, when asked to handle even mild maneuvering emergencies, most bulky SUVs change lanes with the finesse of a three-legged hippo. 

Two: They are typically propelled by an engine borrowed from a passenger sedan sibling. Even when modified upward, the amount of honk produced by a 200-horsepower V-6 is never quite enough to move a 2-ton truck with much authority. 

So we settle for less pace than a subcompact and call it majestic, and accept marginal agility, which we choose to believe is purposeful. 

But no more. 

Not if you have $65,000 left over from holiday spending, the patience to wait until early next year when the 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG goes on sale and the courage to defend its really odd credentials. 

For the ML55 may look a little like a Mazda MPV minivan, but it can accelerate alongside a Jaguar XJ8, runs out faster than a Porsche Boxster and costs more than a Range Rover 4.6 HSE. That makes the ML55 the world's only high-performance sport-utility vehicle, as well as the segment's most expensive off-roader, at least until Ferrari announces it will build a four-wheel-drive Terra Traverso.
