            The Volvo S80 is the most luxurious car I have ever owned.  It is jam packed with luxurious features, has tons of space and insanely smooth suspension, and many great environmental and safety features.  To anyone who is looking for a luxury car in the $30,000-$40,000 price range, I definitely recommend the Volvo S80.

First of all, I should mention the great features I have.  The car has a great sun roof for the summer.  It also has a fantastic winter package which includes one of the best air-conditioning systems I have ever had in a car (I can select any temperature and set a dial to auto and it will keep the interior of the car at that temperature automatically), and heated seats (in DC the temperature ranges from 10 degrees to 100 in the average year).  I also have leather seats and a cd player.  All these elements combine into a luxurious experience every time I enter my car.

The suspension is unbelievably smooth, and after having ridden in SUVs along the streets of DC I love being able to ride in the comfort which this car provides.  The car is the roomiest of any in its class that I have ever ridden in.  Five people could easily fit in with comfort, and only four could sit in absolute comfort.  

The environmental features are amazing.  The S80 comes with a device which changes ground level ozone into oxygen, and other features which are exclusive to the Volvo S class.  The only downside to the car is its unfortunate gas mileage, which is about 18 city to 23 highway mpg.  Still this is a rather environmentally sound car, and a very luxurious one.
