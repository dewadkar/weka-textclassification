            I was shopping around for an affordable yet, sleek sports car. After looking at many makes and models I had almost given up. On a whim, I pulled into the local Mitsubishi Dealer and checked out a 97 Eclipse. To my surprise, I fell in love with it right away. This car seems well put together as well as extremely hot! This front wheel drive handles great on dry surfaces. I have noticed that she slides a bit on rain or snow. I was informed that this was because of the racing tires. This car is also really comfortable to drive. Whether going to the grocery store or across the country, I feel comfortable in the drivers seat. I am also very pleased with the factory installed sound system. This model came with 4 speakers that really rock!

I only have two negative comments about the car. For many of you, it will be a minor detail. I have noticed that when the driver's side window is open and it's either raining slightly or you wash the windows while moving, that the liquids drip into the car.  I am not talking about an all out down pour (why would the windows be open?). The other negative is that there isn't much room in the backseat. 

I would recommend this car for anyone who is looking for a great ride.  <br><br>
