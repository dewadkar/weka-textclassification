            I'm 21 going on 22 in February of 2000 and I purchased a GS400.  I loved cars ever since I could remember.  I was probably the only kid in 3rd grade that could spell Lamborghini.  I was destined to own a car of my dreams.  My mom helped me with my down payment of $37,000.  My purchase price was $50,665 on a crystal white 400 equipped w/the Navigation package, 17&quot; wheels (not chrome), and spoiler.  Sales tax in California was $3930.03 and luxury tax was $635.50.  Licensing was $803.00.  My APR of 9.00% on $23,762.40 for 60 months was $4683.87.  Total price equals $60,762.40.  I'm now paying $396.04 a month and $203.00 for insurance.  I'm only 21 and I work at a car stereo shop making close to minimum wage.  Basically every penny I make is going into that car.  Lucky I live at home.  &quot;Is it worth it?&quot; you ask.  Of course it is.  Its the ultimate luxury sports sedan.  I plan to keep it for 10 years so I thought of everything before purchasing this vehicle.  No other car can compare.  Bmw's and Mercedes' just cost too much to maintain as well as having higher insurance rates.  The Lexus GS400 is flawless in detail and above the rest in comparison if not right behind on their tails.  I could have bought a Bmw 540 (automatic) or Mercedes E430 but the Lexus is torquier and straight out quicker.  Plus its got the traditional Toyota reliability.  My previous car was a `94 Integra and I had it &quot;fixed up&quot; w/suspension and engine upgrades.  Over the 6 years I spent modifying my 1.8L I realized that purchasing an inferior car and trying to muster extra power and performance out it was pointless.  You lose the comfort and reliability only a manufacturer can install on an automobile.  That's why I couldn't settle for less.  I feel that purchasing my Lexus was the smartest financial decision I've ever made.  But then again I'm only 21.    <br><br>
