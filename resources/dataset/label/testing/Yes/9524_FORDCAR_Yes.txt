            I have owned my 1995 GT since August of 2000. I love this car so much I bought it totalled and fixed it up.

I had a 93 Mustang LX previously to this Mustang. Somehow I just fell for the Mustang. I love the power, handling, and looks. I strapped a 98 Cobra hood and some 95 Cobra R wheels on, along with my rare paint color(Vibrant Red), my car is a real head turner. You can just tell it's not like any other V-6 Mustang on the road. 

The GT has led up to all my expectations. It was everything I wanted, and I'm definitely not dissapointed. The only thing that lets me down a little is an under-powered motor. 215 horsepower isn't really enough, but if your interesting in making more, it's not hard at all. 400  horsepower can be easily achieved with a power adder, the basic bolt ons, and a good tune. Same for suspension, as it can be as customized as you want. Most shops can work on these cars blind as the 5.0 motor is so common.( Note, the last year for the 5.0 motor is 1995, 1996 and up have the 4.6 modular motor.)

Obviously the product is aimed at several markets. Men and teenagers for the GT and Cobra versions; Women to the v-6 models. However, I do believe that some knowledge of how to drive a car well is important. If you drive in snow consistantly in the winter I do not resommend this car. It is highly difficult to drive in the snow if it's not equipped with snow tires and proper weight additions.

I bought it because I love the history of the Mustang. The 95 GT I have just ripped out my eyes and I had to buy it. Now I have a sweet car, that is plenty comfortable for myself and my girlfriend. The backseat is small, but hey, it's a sports car. If you buy this car and intend to use it, it will mainly be used for grocery bags and other stuff. Trying to get an adult back there is almost impossible. 

My car is my dream, so my opinion could be biased. I'm not "new" to Mustangs, I have history with them and have always liked them. Obviously, I won't see problems like other people because "love is blind". However, in all honesty, there is nothing I don't like about my car.
