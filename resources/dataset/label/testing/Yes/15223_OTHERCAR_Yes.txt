            We purchased the 200 Toyota Sienna February of 2000, and 13 months and 13,000 miles later, our family still loves it. We chose the Seinna for the excellent safety test results, and Toyota's legendary reliability.  The Windstar was a close second, but its fit-and-finish was not up to Toyota's level, and the Sienna is a more attractive vehicle.

Knowing my family is safe makes the ultra-comfortable ride much more enjoyable.  We have the base 5-door CE, and my wife and I find the front seats comfortable, with a commanding view of the road. My wife prefers the second row bench to the captain's chairs (found in some higher level trim packages). Child seats are easy to install.  The V6 engine is very responsive and peppy, providing the right combination of acceleration and control. We average about 24 MPG.

I find the lack of seating combinations unfortunate.  Other minivans allow you to rearrange the seating configuration to your liking.  Removing the third seats can be cumbersome.  While the minivan has not been noted for its interior cargo space, I expect the van to serve well when our 3rd child is born in July.
