            As the current owner of a 1996 Jeep Cherokee and the owner of a previous 1990 Cherokee I give this SUV a big double thumbs up. For beginners you definately get your moneys worth.It isn't flashy but it is one heck of a workhorse. It's off road capabilities far surpass those of other SUV's I have has the privledge to test drive.

 The interior is roomy enough for a family of 5 and ample trunk space allows you to tote along whatever yuo may desire to. Gas mileage is adequate if not better than expected. The ride is somewhat rough but then again this is not a luxury SUV. For a smoother ride I would recommend the Grand Cherokee. The interior is also somewhat plain not fancy gadgets or instrument panels but adequate for what you need. 

In the dependability category I rate very high. We never have had a single problem engine or otherwise with either of our Jeeps. Our 1990 went to our son where it still remains problem free today well over 130,000 miles

 If you are looking for a luxury SUV then the regular Cherokee is not for you. If you are looking for a down to earth fun ride SUV with remarkable off road capabilities while still great as an every day truck then this is the SUV for you. If I could add any one thing to the Cherokee it would be back seat cup holders and a bit of a higher seat ( though the seats are extremely adequate as well).<br><br>
