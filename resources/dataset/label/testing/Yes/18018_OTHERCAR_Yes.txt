            Excellent choice for a digital camera. I purchased the Olympus D-620L because of the (1) zoom capability and (2) through-the-lense viewing. Have owned the D-620L for about six months, now, using it for news coverage for a weekly newspaper, in all conditions from low-light to using alternative flash sources and have found it to be an excellent overall-use camera.

At the time of purchase, the camera was at the high end of non-professional cameras at about $900, but understand that the price range has dropped.

Using the &quot;super-fine&quot; mode (1700 pixels) the 16 mb Smartcard will hold between 16 and 18 photographs, so if the user needs to photograph more photos in one setting, one must purchase additional Smartcards at a price of about $75 each. 

Download directly from the camera to the computer is slow (about 1 minute per photo. However, by using a Flashpath adapter in the 3 1/2&quot; computer drive, download time is cut by about one-half. (SmartCard adaptors cost range from about $75 to $100) but well worth it.

Autofocus feature is excellent, though cannot focus in low light conditions or in conditions with little or no contrast.

viewfinder provides a view of about 95% of picture area. Under moderate low-light conditions, the camera will expose the photo, but causes blurring when the subject is moving.

My first digital was a Ricoh digital with two zoom settings ((portrait and distant) but had only 750 pixel maximum capabilities. I chose the Olympus D-620L as a replacement because of the larger format area and through-the-lens system (one of the very few &quot;personal&quot; cameras capable of this feature).

The small built-in flash is excellent for short-distance photography but is not adequate for a distance beyond about 20 feet. Beyond that range, one must use a separate after-market flash, but is difficult to get the flash's settings so that one does not either under or over expose. 

After downloading photographs, however, when using a quality software (I use Adobe Photoshop) one can readily enhance, crop, modify colors, contrast and sharpness. The camera comes with a software program that has limited capabilities in this area, but is useful if no other photo software program is available.

The D620L is surprisingly lightweight. Camera controls are easy to use, easy to learn and to remember. The small review screen located on the back of the camera provides an excellent review of either the latest picture taken, or preview pictures. However, when using the viewfinder, one is very likely to get facial oils on the small review screen, requiring regular cleaning. I installed a clear plastic cover over the screen to eliminate this factor and to protect the sensitive, easily scratchable screen from damage. the protective screen works well and is removable (using velcro.

The camera eats up regular alkaline batteries (four), particularly in high mode photography and with flash. I use rechargeable batteries (two sets that are interchangeable to help correct this problem. The camera's setting screen (that gives the photographer information about the various settings of the camera) does provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange batteries when battery condition become low (the camera will not function when battery condition falls below that required.

Overall, however, I have found the Olympus D620L an excellent choice for digital cameras in the medium price range (below $1,000).
