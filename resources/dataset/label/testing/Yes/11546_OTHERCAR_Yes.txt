            Excellent Vehicle.  I'm not going to hammer anyone with vehicle specs they can read for themselves.  This review is strictly based on the real world performance of my Cherokee.  

I live at 9000ft and work at 5500ft with a commute distance of 35 miles each way on mountain roads.  It snows from October through April, and I make many runs over the high passes of the Rockies in both summer and winter.  I opted for a Cherokee SE with a 5 speed manual transmission,  4.0  liter engine, and the up-country suspension.  With cruise, a top mount spare carrier, and CD player,  It totaled out at about $19,500.  

The Cherokee is strong going over the high mountain passes at speed with virtually no power loss when fully loaded, and it handles the forest service trails and dirt roads as only a Jeep can. Interior room is ample (I'm 6'1&quot;)and works well for 4 adults with gear. 

My initial &quot;upgrade&quot; was a K&amp;N stock replacement air filter (no warranty repercussions) which helped the vehicle breathe much better at altitude. The manual transmission was a little &quot;notchy&quot; at first,  but that has smoothed out with break-in.  The stock brake rotors only got me to 40K,  so I replaced them with better at the first pad change. The new rotors were $43 each.  

The vehicle handles extremely well in all conditions,  and has the most balanced demeanor of any I have driven.The suspension is a little stiffer than some care for,  but it works considerably better for the off-road portion of my existence.  Jeep could have used a stronger gear ratio front and rear for more torque,  but I'll trade that for the fuel economy as I am averaging a good 19mpg on the commute. 

For the price,  I don't believe there is a more well positioned vehicle than the Cherokee.  It is stronger than most of the higher-priced competitors, and considerably more robust on and off-road than any of those or any of the &quot;car toys&quot;.  I get good &quot;peace of mind&quot; knowing my family and I have this vehicle available to us,  no matter what conditions mother nature may bring.<br><br>
