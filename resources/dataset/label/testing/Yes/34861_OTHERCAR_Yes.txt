                 I bought this vehicle because I wanted a car that could carry more cargo, and I also wanted a car that gave me more room.  Before my purchase of this car I owned a Jetta which as you know is a compact car.  I just never really felt comfortable in it because of its small size.  I always felt too crammed in.  There are many things that I love about this car.  I love the price of it cause I belive that this car was well worth the 28,000 dollars that I paid for it.  I love how easy it is to remove the seats from the car to allow me more space for hauling goods.  I also love its sound system which includes am fm radio with a CD player.  I also love to drive this car it is a smooth ride for a van and I just enjoy driving it.  The things that I hate about this car are that the cup holders in back don't hold cups very well and there have been a couple of accidents if you know what I mean.  This is a great car for anybody who wants a bigger car or who brings lots of things from one place to another a lot.  It is also great for families with kids, it sits 7 and makes road trips a lot more bearable.  So if you are thinking about purchasing this vehicle I strongly encourage you to do so.   <br><br>
