            I am 22 years old and I have had six cars since I received my drivers license at 16.  I guess you could say I have had bad luck with my choices in vehicles so far.  But as of December 6, 1999 I have owned a Mitsubishi Galant ES and I am greatly satisfied.  I have been interested in the Galant for many years but I could never afford the payment.  When I finally was able to I jumped at the opportunity.  The first dealership I went to wanted 18,976 for the vehicle I was interested in and would not budge.  So I was referred by a family member to another dealer whom sold me the same model for 17,100.  Go figure?  I have had my Galant for almost 2 months now and I am so happy, i feel like a kid again.  The ride is so smooth, the stereo system is GREAT!!!, when sitting in traffic at 5:00pm for an hour I feel like I am sitting at home on the couch.  I will never buy another model other than the Galant.  Mitsu. has my business for the rest of my life.  I just hope that they don't change the body style to that new aero-dynamic style they are making all the other cars into.  I don't know about everyone else but I like the plain old boxy cars. Pardon me if I am boring you but this is my first Epinion.  If you like please reply.
