            I love this thing! I bought my D-400Z about 3 weeks ago. It takes some very good pictures and has a lot of options that are available. For the price, ~$500, it was what I was looking for!

First off, it's not complicated to use. I was amazed by how easy it was to set up and use the first time. It came with 4 AA batteries, an 8MB Smart Media� card, and the floppy adapter, which I haven't been able to get to work yet! It's got all the common features of your standard 35MM camera, plus a little more. 

The camera has 3 different picture quality settings. With the included 8MB Smart Media� card, you can take 18 Pics in &quot;SHQ&quot; (Super High Quality) mode, 36 Pics in &quot;HQ&quot; (High Quality) mode, and 122 Pics in &quot;SQ&quot; (Standard Quality) mode. I recommend using at least the &quot;HQ&quot; mode. It takes a VERY LARGE picture, and the quality is MUCH better than the &quot;SQ&quot; mode. The only problem with the &quot;HQ&quot; mode is that the picture is just so big! It's a good idea to shrink it with a photo editing program(ie. Adobe Photoshop)
so that the pic isn't as large in file size so that it's easier for people to download in emails and web pages.

I also recommend purchasing a separate Smart Media� card of at least 16MB so that you can store more pics in &quot;HQ&quot; mode. I purchased another Smart Media� memory card from Best Buy for about $60. With this 16MB Smart Media� card, the camera can take 36 pics in &quot;SHQ&quot; mode, 73 Pics in &quot;HQ&quot; mode, and a whopping 244 pics in &quot;SQ&quot; mode. 

It would also be a good idea to purchase a Smart Media� card reader. If you use the Camera's serial cable to transfer the images to your PC, it takes about 20 minutes to transfer 36 images that were recorded in &quot;HQ&quot; mode. I purchased a Smart Media� reader from Best Buy as well. It's made buy SanDisk and it cost ~$100. It is SO MUCH FASTER!!!  I was able to transfer 36 &quot;HQ&quot; images in about 2 SECONDS, compared to 20 minutes using the camera's serial transfer. If you going to be taking a lot of pictures, it would be a very good investment to buy the SanDisk ImageMate.

The flash system on the camera is very nice as well. It has the standard flash and &quot;Red-Eye&quot; reduction mode. There are many other options that are in this camera, but too many to list! Go buy one, it will be worth you money.
