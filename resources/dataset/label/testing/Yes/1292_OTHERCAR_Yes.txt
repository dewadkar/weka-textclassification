            You just gotta love the 4Runner!  Definitely, without a doubt, one of the greatest cars on the road.
I was fortunate enough to have gotten my 1997 4Runner LTD as my first car! :D  yeah, I know.  I'm spoiled. but hey, I've taken good care of my baby!  At 2 and a half years old, the thing still runs and looks like it's still brand new. My mother asked me the other day if it was a year old yet.  (I know, odd huh)  Well, she asked based on how it runs.  I've done all the standard service: tire rotations, oil change every 3000, 15,000 mile checkup, 30,000 mile tuneup, etc.  Well, my car runs the best of the six cars my family owns, even though it's not the newest, nor the most expensive.  My mother's mercedes is competition in that area, but it also cost twice as much, and is half as old.
One of the main reasons I chose the 4Runner was because of its reliability.  As a male teenager, I'm a car FREAK and know too much about cars for my own good. Friends, friend's parents, my sisters' friends and boyfriends, etc all come to me when they are about to buy a car.  My parents leased a Previa because I recommended it (GREAT van.  too bad they don't make it anymore).  My sister's boyfriend purchased a 750i because I suggested it.  anyway, my knowledge of cars was huge.  when it came to choosing a car for myself, I chose the 4Runner without hesitation.  My aunt owned a old 88 4Runner which she put 400,000 miles on without a problem (drives to arrowhead a lot where my cousin trains).  she would have put more but it was stolen.  Guess thiefs like it, too.  My friend also owned a similar 4Runner and they've put around 300,000 miles on that (they like to drive a LOT.  drove the thing down from alaska).  both cars were, and are completely trustworthy.  this, our previa, and everything about Toyota and their 4Runner helped me make my decision to choose the 4Runner.
Well, as to how I got the Limited one... Well, I wanted a 4Runner w/ a V6 (gotta have that power!).  My dad liked the Limited a lot so he decided to get that one. Hey, I have no problems w/ that!
Another thing that's great about the 4Runner: SOLID LIKE A ROCK!  (I'm sure chevys are too, but they probably don't run as well)  I've helped people off to the sides of the road (or freeway) numerous times when their cars break down.  I got the front and rear brush guards so it helps a lot :)  this one time I helped a lady and pushed her to a nearby gas station.  we kinda got a police escort halfway there which was pretty neat.  the policemen gave me incredulous looks when we got there so I asked them &quot;what?&quot;  they were surprised that I used my &quot;$30,000 car&quot; to help that lady.  I didn't really appreciate that.  I say if I got it, use it.  you know?  Well, there was this other incident where my 4Runner proved to be stronger than I thought.  I was involved in an accident, but came out with only a sore neck.  THAT'S IT!  nothing happened to the car.  what happened was the cars ahead of me all stopped abruptly and I hit the brakes so hard that the ABS popped in (gotta love the abs).  well, I was listening for the screech of tires behind me since everyone ahead screeched a little, but there wasn't a sound. (everything seemed to slow down when this happened)  I thought, &quot;uh oh&quot;  then I heard it. screeeeeeeeCRUNCH  it was the worst sound I've ever heard.  I looked back, expecting to see some person's hood peeking into my back seat, but there was nothing.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out, while the other person pulled up behind me.  I saw her car and freaked out.  her bumper was all crushed in and deformed.  I continued walking to the back of my car and then looked.  Nothing.  No damage to my car!!  she hit my trailer hitch!  I had one paint chip on my trailer hitch the size of a rice grain.  I went to a toyota dealer to have the car checked anyway and there was nothing wrong with my car.  meanwhile, I'm sure she had at least $1500 damage to her car. 
Well, I currently have 32,000 miles on my car and it still runs like new.  I installed a sound system into my car, which is also quite easy since there's so much room in the car.  Everything about the car is great.  the only problem I've had with my car is the numb butt syndrome when I drove up to san fran (6 hour drive).  I think that happens in every car though.  also, my seat leather is getting hard cuz I can't find any good leather conditioner.  well, maybe not even that.  I'm comparing that to the leather in our mercedes, which probably cost $5000 a seat.  but I have to admit that the cloth seats a little softer.  but cloth seats dont really match in the LTD 4Runner now do they.  hehe.  Another thing is that it could use a little more power.  But that comment is coming from a psycho teenager who loves speed, and frankly, this car isn't built for speed.  it's built for rocks! :)  well, I love everything else about my car.  Gotta love it!  

oh, another downside to the 4Runner.. my parents and sisters love driving it, too!  Whenever one of their cars is &quot;indisposed&quot;, they take my car and I'm left w/o a car.  their cars seem to be &quot;indisposed&quot; quite often :)
