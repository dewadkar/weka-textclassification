            Aside from a School bus flattening the front of ours, We have had no problem with this vehicle. One complaint is that the engine is low on power, causing the transmision to hunt for gears while going uphill at highway speeds, nobody else seems to notice. My only other complaint is that when the 3rd row seat is up, there is only about 6in behind the seat. 

Seating comfort is great for 4 adults. The second row bench is not comfortable for the middle passenger, the seatback doubling as the armrests when not folded. The third row seat is comfortable but legroom is at a premium as with all SUV 3rd row seats. The second row of seats slide foreward to give 3rd row passengers more room, but at the sacrifice of second row room. Second row captains chairs are available but I think that that subtracts from the functionality of the vehicle, sometimes we need the room for five and a lot of stuff (vacations). 

The Rendezvous is Based on GMs 10 year old Minivan Platform which over the years has become well known for reliability. This older platform has also given GM the time to work out the kinks. Because it is based on a minivan, this SUV has a good ride in addition to a good view. Since it isn't based on a Pickup platform like most other American SUVs, it gets better mileage and comfort, at the sacrifice of towing ability and off-road ability. The Rendezvous will, however, handle all of the rutted dirt roads and potholes that would hang up a regular car. 

It has many nooks and crannys for hiding things and you can remove the middle seats for lots of cargo room. The radio in ours is not a top of the line but still sounds awesome. The OnStar thing is great too, I've used it several times to unlock the doors when I forgot to remove the keys before locking the doors. The OnStar had the driver's door open in about 5 minutes.  OnStar was also able to tell my mother why the "Check Engine" light had come on (loose gas cap.)  NEAT! 

The 2002s are the best finds because 2003 model CXs were not offered with leather trim. The cloth trim in Buicks is not attractive in the least as it is thin and not soft in any way. The leather is the only acceptable material they offer and on 2003s is only offered on the top of the line Rendezvous CXL with AWD, Starting at about $35K. 

Through the dealership I have learned that Buick plans to introduce a larger V6, an all-new "premium" 3.6L V6, to solve the Rendezvous' lack of overall torque and horsepower found in the Rendezvous' 3.4L V6 (one of GM's smaller V6s). The Rendezvouses with the new V6 are probably worth the wait. I am convinced that a prime factor in the Buick's lack of power is the Transaxle. It seems to be geared too much for economy and the shifting programming holds gears too long and resists downshifting. When it does downshift, it does so with a dissatisfying "Clunk!" 

For someone with no need for speed and does not experience many steep climbs, The Rendezvous is an awesome Minivan substitute, and so far, the only American made one. Every year Buick loans out cars and SUVs to the PGA for the golf tournaments. These, still new, low mileage cars are then resold to the public at large discounts. Who knows, maybe Tiger Woods drove yours. 

-------------Helpful Hint-----------------

Recently we had a problem with noises eminating from the vehicle. It would only make the noise when the engine was cold, so naturally the dealership could never hear it. So one day we took it in to get the oil changed, and since it was a busy day, it took a while for them to get around to the thing. By the time they got to the car, the engine was completely cool, so they were able to hear the noise - it was a catalytic converter gone bad. It was fixed under warranty. That just goes to show you, cars act differently when they're warm than when they're cold. So when you take yours in to get it fixed, let it sit a while and cool down at the shop.

--------------GET THIS-------------

In a recent visit to fix a worn hinge, I talked with the Sales Manager and he informed me that the new 3600 engine will only be offered in the top-of-the-line Rendezvous Ultra. Start saving up, the Ultra package will raise the price into the low to mid 40Ks.

Update-----------------
Today I removed the Middle-Row seats for the first time to move a mess of computers (the third row flattens but doesn't remove.)  I was surprized to see how much room was made available.  I was able to stand (though not straight) where the seats had been and there was more than enough room for all of the stuff I needed to move.  Once I had unloaded all of the stuff the Third row seats went up and two of my friends got a ride, loving the infinite legroom provided by not having the middle row of seats.
COOL.
