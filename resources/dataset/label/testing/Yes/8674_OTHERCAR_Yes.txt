            I spent months looking around for a digital camera. I thought an important factor would be the zoom. I was right about this. There are so many times when taking a picture, that I wish I could have zoomed in more, with this camera I can.

I have seen mixed reviews about being able to take a shot at full 10x zoom and it being blurry. This was my major concern, as I was comparing this to the c3040z. I am glad to say that under good light conditions, I have no problems taking shots at full zoom. They come out perfectly clear and crisp. 

The one touch white touch balance on this camera does wonders, especially at night. My photos were at first all red at night, with the white touch balance, the colors were extremely accurate. 

The movie mode on this camera with sound recording is useful as well. My favorite feature on the camera is of course the 10x optical zoom. The camera doesn't have image stabilization, so some people complain about getting blurred photos at full zoom, but for me this was not a problem. 

I am using some NIMH 1800 batteries and took over 100 shots and 3 video clips this week, batteries are still fine.
