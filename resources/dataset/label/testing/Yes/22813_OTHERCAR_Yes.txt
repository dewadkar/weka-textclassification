            The 1999 Cadillac - Escalade is a Wonderful SUV.  I bought this vehicle based on 3 facts.

1) The 4WD features.  The '99 Escalade is equipped with a buttons to shift from 2WD to 4WD and vice verse.  One can change from on status up to 40 Miles per hour.  Four Wheel drive buttons are conveniently placed on the Dash for ease of access.  

2) OnStar.  The OnStar is a futuristic feature that once was only conceivable in James Bond movies.  Again, with the touch of a button you are automatically connected to a live person via a Satellite, (cell phone) connection.  This person will help you with as little as finding the correct street you want or a much as calling the police in the case of an emergency.

The OnStar satellite system is also constantly protecting your vehicle (much more so than the well renowned LoJack vehicle security system).  For example, should you park your vehicle and someone broke into the vehicle the OnStar personnel will immediately be in contact with the person in the vehcile requiring them to provide Name, Password, etc. to verify their identity.  If the occupant of the vehicle cannot provide this information the vehicle can be Disabled from OnStar and the police located and immediately sent to the scene.  Needless to say the OnStar feature is a comforting Nicety.

3) The Escalade handles like a car.  Though the Escalade is wide and long one can maneuver this vehicle with the greatest of ease.  Even a lady of 5' can adjust her seat and maneuver this vehicle effortlessly.

Now, if one craves attention from peers this is the vehicle to drive.  There are few of them on the road thus one is subjected extreme positive Scrutiny.  I personally enjoy this aspect of driving the Escalade.
