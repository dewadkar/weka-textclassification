            Although my regular car is a Saab 9-3 convertible, I had the opportunity to drive a 9-5 Aero recently for a few days while my car was being serviced.  To clarify what the difference between the 9-5 Aero and base 9-5s is: the Aero is the high-power, high-performance version.  It comes standard with a turbocharged 230 hp engine ... and let me tell you, that sucker can MOVE.  Normally automatic transmission-equipped turbos (including my 9-3) are slow as molasses -- not the Aero.  Turbo lag is practically nonexistent, and power can be felt almost the instant you step on the accelerator.  In fact, I would say this car gets going even more quickly than my father's BMW 540i.

Aside from the engine, the Aero gets a number of other performance enhancements as well.  Included in the Aero package are some beefy, low-profile 17&quot; wheels, suspension enhancements, and a few interior upgrades (e.g. a performance steering wheel with nubs at 10 and 2 o'clock).  While handling isn't quite up to the gold standard for sports sedans -- the 540i -- it's nevertheless extremely poised and far better than any other Saab I've driven previously (including 900s, 9000s, 9-3s, and non-Aero 9-5s).  Body roll is minimal, and cornering is assuredly smooth and predictable.  One greatly appreciated feature -- which, frankly, every Saab should have, not just the top-of-the-line 9-5s -- is traction control, which keeps what otherwise might be a torque-steer nightmare firmly in check.  The ride is smooth and generally quiet, although the car is a little louder (particularly at peak acceleration) than other luxury cars in its class are.  Of course, this being a Saab, just about every safety feature you can think of -- front air bags, side air bags, rigid structure, ABS, etc. -- is available, along with the usual Swedish quirks of indecipherable window-down switches and the ignition switch in the center console.

Also like other Saabs, the 9-5 has an abundance of room.  The front is airy and open, and the rear seat has limousine-level leg room -- something always appreciated by six-foot-and-over guys like myself.  My sole complaint about the car I drove was that it didn't have the 9-5's nifty seat coolers as an option.

In short, if you're looking for a large, high-performing, but still relatively inexpensive European luxury car, I'd suggest putting the Saab 9-5 Aero right at the top of your list, along with Volvo's excellent S80 T-6.<br><br>
