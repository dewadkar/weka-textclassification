            I love my S10.  I have friends of mine that just stare at me whenever I drive by because they are jealous.  It was sort of a mistake that I purchased this truck and the dealer who sold it to me made an even bigger mistake.  I was going to get a truck for my HS graduation, and was looking at silverados, but my eye caught this particular truck.  Vortec V6 code Z engine, 5 speed manual transmission, extended cab, silver with the red trim and &quot;Heartbeat USA&quot; logos.  I love it.  I purchased the truck with 142,000 miles on it, and it now has 171,000.  I drive this truck EVERYWHERE, hauling people when I need too, and when I am not, I have 2 10&quot; subwoofers pumping out that good ole' redneck country music.  I have never had a problem during the last year that I have owned it.  I did loose control of it one time, and I did have a blazer hit me in the front right of the truck, but it keeps going and going.  Hauling a 87 Sentra was no problem for this truck.  A little bit of strain, but the truck kept up on how I wanted it to do.  I love this little truck.  Everything on it is factory, with the exception of the stereo.  I purchased the vehicle with a Pioneer CD-Player, and since replaced it with a new Panasonic unit.  I was so lucky on this find, for $5700, I had the origional owners manuals and origional papers from the origional dealer and owner.  The only thing that I do not like about the vehicle is that the V6 is hard to change spark plugs in.<br><br>
