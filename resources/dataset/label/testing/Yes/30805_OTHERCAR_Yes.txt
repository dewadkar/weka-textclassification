            Bought the camera on St. Thomas at recommendation of cruise ship crew person. It is compact, lightweight and it is easy to carry the &quot;smart card&quot; picture holders.  Recently came back from Tahiti cruise with about 360 pictures and no film to process or prints to wait for.   They easily load into the computer with the software provided with the camera. If you are going to make 8X10 prints you are going to want something more sophisticated than this model. If you have a decent printer and use photo quality paper you will find that the D-340-R will give you excellent results. The instruction book would be easier to read if they put each language translation in a separate section instead of interspersing all of the languages. There are many features available - probably more than most people will ever use.  I recommend this equipment for photographers from entry level to fairly serious amateurs. <br><br>
