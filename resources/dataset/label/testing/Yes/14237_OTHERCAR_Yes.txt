            There really aren't any bad points to contend with, in light of the amazing deals they are giving on these little gems.
My truck is a gorgeous dark cherry red, and with the GM incentives and dealer haggling, my brand new, never driven by anyone but me S-10 was 11 thousand dollars!!!!!!!

and this is, by any standard, a fairly well LOADED truck...

Air conditioning that will freeze you, a CD player with a radio that tells you what songs are playing on the station you are listening to - and that radio gets louder as you go faster, and quieter at a stop!  Automatic trans that shifts as smoothly as a Mercedes, alloy rims, dark tinted windows with a rear slider,  leather wrapped steering wheel mounted on a tilt column, and let me tell you something, you get some decent tunes going, tilt that seat back a little, set the cruise control (yep, it has CRUISE CONTROL too!), and you are comfortable as can be, quiet, rides nice, you feel like a million bucks riding in this little jewel of a truck that shines like new money.

not a bad deal for 11,000!  I don't think you will find a car that is this nicely equipped for the money.

This model is also TEN YEARS OLD, which to some means its old style, outdated ... but to me, that means it has ALL of its bugs out, aftermarket goodies are limitless, and there is tremendous competition for your dollar.
