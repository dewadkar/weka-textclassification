            My first car (at least first car that I've owned on my own) was a 1993 Nissan Pathfinder XE 4x4 in a Manual transmission.  Despite it's various faults (noisy ride, repeatedly warping right engine manifold, anemic power and truck-cow like handling) I grew to love the beast.  It was nearly unstoppable while off roading and was a much better buy for the money than most any other SUV in that class at the time.

Towards the end of last year and 150,000 miles later, I was starting to feel like I needed to replace the old beast.  I have to admit, I was a bit torn as it was still running (albeit a bit roughly).  In the end, the improved looks and power of the 2001/2002 model year Pathfinders got the better of me and I took the plunge.
The 1997-1999's all looked too much like bulky station wagons to me and seemed to water down the whole SUV lineage of the noble Pathfinder breed.

I could not have been happier with my choice.  I think I put on 2000 miles in the first 2 weeks of owning this truck.

First of all, the 2002 Pathfinder is a decidedly different truck than the 1993 I started with.  Not truck like at all either in handling or in comfort level.  The unibody construction lends a VERY car-like handling and feel to this truck.  Combined with it's ample 250 hp (I got the Manual transmission, the Auto gives 240 hp but a bit more torque in exchange for the 10 hp loss) 3.5 liter engine, it is hands down the fastest SUV in it's class (midsized SUV's).  I'm not putting the BMW X5 in this class as it is MUCH more expensive.  There is a bit of a rough exhaust note at low (sub 2000) RPM's coming out of first, but this is otherwise a very smooth and powerful ride.

The 4WD drive train is smoother and can be engaged and disengaged at higher speeds (now 45-55 mph vs 35 mph in the old one).  Unless you get the LE or the QX4 which has a center differential, the SE's 4WD drive train is best used on snowy/wet/loose/dirt terrain or roads to avoid excessive wear and tear on the transmission and transfer case and the tires.

The ride height and clearance is a bit lower than the 1993 (8 inches instead of 11 inches) and certainly much lower than the Toyota 4 Runner's (which is still based on a truck's ladder frame construction).  Like the other reviewer, I find I'm not off-roading as much as I used to.  I do use it in the snow 50-60 days a year (I otherwise live in Southern California normally) and it's performance in snow is quite good.

The Tires are the only thing I don't like about the drive train.  The stock 16" Wheels are really nice, but they are mated with rather low profile street tires rather an real truck tires.  The Toyo tires that came with my Pathfinder were not the stickiest and tended to spin a bit in ice/snow, even with the limited slip differential (at the time, I was going through 1 1/2 - 2 ft of snow mind you).  My 1993 with more aggressive tires never did this even without limited slip.  I'll have to see how it does with a more aggressive tread after I wear the stock tires out.

The interior is much plusher than I'm used to even though I went with cloth seats compared with my old 1993 Pathfinder (that one didn't even have power windows or locks!).  It is much quieter now (though the QX4's and 4 Runners seem even quieter) with a tastefully appointed and thoughtful interior (finally, rear cup holders, a tonneau cover and 2 extra 12 volt accessory jacks).  I liked the 8 speaker arrangement of the 1993 Pathfinder better, however, the 2001/2002's 6 speaker Bose system is impressive.  The in dash 6 CD changer is very nifty, but a bit slow in swapping dics.  You do however gain the convenience of having access to all your dics from the driver's compartment.  With a stick shift, you will have a hard time changing the dics while in 3rd or 5th gear.

I've had the 2001 Pathfinder for about 8 months and couldn't be happier.  I have had NO problems with it at all and I do not hesitate to recommend it to those who are in the market for a reasonably sized SUV (not one of those big land yachts that pass as SUV's now a days).  My only regret is the generally poor gas mileage (15/18 mpg) which seems pretty irresponsible given the inexorable depletion of fossil fuels that is occurring.  I do try to moderate my gas consumption by driving a more efficient sedan for day to day use and save the truck for when I'm transporting several people to the mountains/camping/climbing/etc.  Otherwise, this fine SUV is a car I don't mind indulging in...with the faintest pangs of guilt:)
