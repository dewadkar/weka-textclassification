                The 1998 Lincoln Town Car is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  You could probably live in those leather seats.  The audio system is great and the CD changer option is definitley a good deal.  The RDS (radio data system) is the coolest thing i've ever seen on a radio.  Yet, with all the luxury, comfort, and cool gadgets, the Town Car does have it's downpoints.  First, it is more roomy in the back than in front.  Second, the sides slope inward so it is easy hit your head on the way in.  Also, the trunk does not open up much, so you can hit your head on that too.  Otherwise everything is cool.  Smooth quiet ride, comfy suspension. As Ferris Bueller said, &quot;If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up!&quot;  He was talking about a ferrari, but this is good too.<br><br>
