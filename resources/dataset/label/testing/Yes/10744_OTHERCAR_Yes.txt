            WOW! What an excellent buy. We have had our Tribute for a little over a month, and love it. We bought the Tribute because we were looking for an SUV, but did not want the SUV price. We were able to get some great options (power locks, power windows and power mirrors, remote keyless entry, a/c, tinted windows, roof rack, bug deflector,) without the big ticket price. Driving the Tribute is amazing. It drives like a car, when cornering we do not feel like we are going to tip over like you do in some SUV's. It is very comfortable. It is also nice to know that we have front AND side airbags. Very safe!<br><br>
