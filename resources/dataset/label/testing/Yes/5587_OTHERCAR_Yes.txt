            I already own an expensive 5MP digital SLR camera but found it was too bulky to take with me everywhere.

I was looking at the Elph and Optio S model, but they were expensive - in most cases 2x - 3x as much as the Nikon and all they offered was a little higher resolution. Not planning to print large pictures, I decided to give the 2100 a try.

The first thing you notice is the ease-of-use. I should not say this, but I mastered the camera on a short drive home from the store. It is the kind of camera that can be given to a spouse with any degree of skill and you know things will be fine.

The images are great for a 2MP camera and I just spent and afternoon chasing my 3-year old son and was amazed with the results, especially since the camera was so small I was almost un-aware that I had it.

If you are looking for a bargain camera, but this one. Since CF cards are cheap, get a 256MB card for about $60 and then you can shoot over 260 pictures on the highest setting. Enough for a short vacation....
