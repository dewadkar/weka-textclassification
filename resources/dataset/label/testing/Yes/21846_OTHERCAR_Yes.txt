            I spent six months looking for a car to replace my Saturn that was going off lease.  With a baby on the way I really wanted a station wagon for the stroller, diaper bag, groceries and kitchen sink.  I tried out virtually every wagon in the 20 to 25K price range.  

I looked at the Passat (too stiff a ride), Legacy (roof in the way and too pricey), Jetta, Golf, Forrester, Taurus and the larger V70 Volvo.  I did a ton of research too.

My V40 is quite fast from a stop light and even better on the highway.  At 140 kph during morning commutes the car still has plenty of speed left in it.  You do hear wind noise, that may be due to the roof racks that are standard on the car.  

The comfort level in the car is outstanding - my wife has a bad back and she loves the seats.  For me this is the most important thing in a car - if you're uncomfortable who cares what the 0 to 60 time is.

Space in the car is adequate for a car in its class and price range.  It is a little smaller than a Passat but is bigger than a Jetta or 3 series BMW.  The cargo area is big enough to hold two medium strollers and two large diaper bags without obscuring the rear window.  Those of you with kids know that strollers take up a lot of room.

The controls are okay...the stereo unit is easy enough to use, the a/c is fully automatic - just set the temperature.  A nice feature is that the car heats up fast and downside is that there are no rear seating a/c vents.  The steering column is not telescoping something that I don't like especially with airbags.

Engine wise everythings been okay so far, the one thing I don't like is the odd shudder I get.  The engine idles at a low rpm and when the a/c kicks in the revs drop noticably.  Fuel mileage has been very good - about 30 mpg in mixed driving is my average.  Speaking of fuel - in my car the gas guage shows empty when I have a little over a quarter tank left.  I don't mind having such a big margin of safety but it makes me wonder sometimes.

The only extreme driving situation that's come up is a sudden stop on some black ice.  Feeling the ABS come on startled me but the car tracked straight and slowed me down quickly.  With good snow tires the car is great in the white stuff, I haven't even had to use the winter mode on the transmission.

Things I don't like include the front cup holder, its flimsy and using it blocks the CD changer.  The rear seat is roomy and has good leg room but is cramped with a car seat.  Because the front seats have a significantly hollowed out back, there's a place for knees, but a rearward facing car seat is too high for this area and forces the front seat to be more upright than I'd prefer.  Even then it's not uncomfortable.

When you buy Volvo you're buying safety - I got this car because it had good rear seat head rests.  With my wife riding in the back seat with the little one I want her to have all the protection that a front seat passenger would have.  I think it's stupid how some cars only have head rests on the front seats.  Head rests are essential to prevent whip-lash injuries.

I wrote that this car was a good value, it was cheaper than a Passat, about the same as a Windstar with options.  I think that for what I'm getting it was worth it.

Before you buy check out the volvo-fan websites for more info about available options and if they're worth it.  I was able to order my car with the options I wanted with two months notice.  I've found that in August the selection of cars is limited and for the money I was spending I wanted the exact car I wanted.
