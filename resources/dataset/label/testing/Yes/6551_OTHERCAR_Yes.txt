            You all have dirty minds!! I'm talking about the wagon.  You remember that big monstrosity that took up 3/4 of the driveway, had the fake wood paneling on the sides and had enough room in the back to haul around all your friends before someone thought seat belts were a good idea?  It also came with an 8 track tape player as standard issue.  Come on even the Bradys had one for all those kids.

Now I'm the mom and have four kids and all the trappings of that lifestyle to haul around.  A wagon just won't cut it when you have that many kids, so I turned to the good folks at Dodge to help me out.

When I only had three kids, that sounds rather funny doesn't it, my husband and I had a Mercury Tracer wagon.  It was a good car, but we wanted some more room.  We began looking at mini vans in the summer of '95. We test drove about 6 models.  We liked the Caravan back then but not enough to take on the added monthly payment.

In fall of '96 we found out baby number four was coming and knew we needed a bigger car, well actually a van.  The first one we looked at was the Grand Caravan.  The brand new '97 models were on the lot and had everything we were looking for and more.  We bought ours the same day we test drove it.  There are many reasons why I like my grand caravan, here are a few:

1. enough room for all four kids
2. quite ride
3. drives and parks like a car (no big blind spots and not hard to turn)
4. plenty of room for gear (double stroller, fold up bed, suitcases, etc..) or on a weekly basis 20 bags of groceries.
5. extra power jacks for walkmans, gameboys, breast pumps, etc..
6. three way climate control - no more cold daddy, freezing mommy.
7. dual sliding doors - a must when you have three kids in car seats
8. comfortable ride - we drove 8 hours each way to Disneyland many times with no complaints and stiff necks or backs
9. plenty of pick up for crossing busy streets and merging into traffic (unlike my mom's woody)
10. an all around great van

Is there anything I don't like?  Not really.  One sliding door broke once, but they fixed it right away.  The seats are heavy to lift out, but I haven't seen any that aren't and I can fold and roll them easily.  If I bought a new one, I'd get it with spilt middle seats so those kids could be separated.  And lastly my only real complaint, the cup holders are no longer big enough to hold the new super sized drinks from McDonalds.

I never thought I'd be the mom in the woody, but now that I am I'm happy I have my grand caravan.  To put it in the lingo of my day, it's groovy.<br><br>
