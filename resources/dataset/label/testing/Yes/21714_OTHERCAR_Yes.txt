            I recently just bought a <b>1998 Chevy Cavalier LS</b> 4 door sedan. I went to a respectable car lot and picked it out and drove it home that same day, with only 19,000 miles on it. I love the handling, power and sporty look.

The interior is big enough to accommodate just about everyone. There are a lot of bells and whistles in this model. There are two overhead map lights, AM/FM radio with cassette, tilt wheel, cruise control, center console with arm rest, two cup holders, anti-lock breaks, daytime running lights, and airbags on both sides. The front seats are conformable and roomy. The back is kind of cramped and tight. The car holds up to 5 people though, which is a plus. The trunk is also very large for such a small car. There is enough room to put a stroller and a weeks worth of groceries in there and still have plenty of room to spare. The spare tire and jack are conveniently tucked away in their own compartment in the trunk. As an added feature there is a grocery net in the trunk to keep bags from spilling over and going all over your trunk.

The engine is sound and strong. It is a 2.2-Liter, 4 Cylinder engine. It produces 120 horsepower. It takes off like a rocket. The pick-up is great. You will have no trouble pulling out into any type of traffic with this engine. The engine runs smooth and quiet. The gas mileage is excellent. I get 25 in the city and 35 on the highway. The car comes in either automatic or manual transmission. I have auto in my car. The transmission is smooth and shifts great in all of the four gears it goes through. The car is also front wheel drive.

The handling of this car is off the charts. I can take the corners with the best of them. The wheelbase can turn on a dime if needed. It handles bumps very nice. The way the car moves on the road is excellent. It hugs the road with a vengeance. I love the way that this car handles.

The exterior is sweet. I love the design of this car. The aerodynamic design cuts right through the wind. The car color I have is gold with tan and black interior. The curves of this car have a future kind of look to it. The headlights and taillights fit right in with the style of this car. 

I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a great car with many, many excellent qualities. I own one and will have it for the life of this car, which from what I have heard from previous Cavalier owners is a very long time.
