            I bought my 1997 Nissan Maxima SE after I graduated college.  It had 35,000 miles and it's in perfect condition.  I've had the car now for over 10 months and I've had zero problems.  

THE GOOD
   The quality of the interior and the exterior is incredible.  The engine has been named the best V6 multiple times by many different automobile magazines.  I have the cloth interior, but I have been in maximas with leather and they are both equally comfortable, they have support in the correct places and easily allow long travel time.  The engine is quiet at all speeds (even at 120, but I would just take my word for that)  The V6 is definately not lacking power, it's probably the fastest V6 sedan available (without a supercharger or turbo).  The air condition and heat respond very quickly and are very efficient.  Depending on which level you have (SE, GLE, GXE) the rides vary.  The GLE has a very smooth ride but tends to float more, as do all cars with a soft suspension.  The SE has a slightly harder ride (still very smooth) because of it's sports suspension, but this allows for better handling.  The interior room of the maxima is great, it has plenty of room front and back.  Even the trunk is huge and the ski hole is handy for longer items that do not fit directly in the trunk.
Finally, the maxima has great resell value.  This is good and bad, it's good cause when you want to sell it you should be able to get what you want.  It's bad because then it's harder to find a deal when you're buying your car.  Because the maxima is so well built and reliable, it makes it a very popular car even if it's years old.


THE BAD
   The only thing that the maxima lacks is the in your face aggressive styling of many other cars, but this can be fixed with aftermarket equipment.  The fuel economy of the maxima isn't the best, but still not bad for a v6.  I get about 23mpg for city driving and much higher for highway. 


I'm very happy with my maxima and have nothing but good things to say about it.  If I can't afford a BMW, my next car will be a maxima again.
