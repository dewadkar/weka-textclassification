            I purchased the Olympus camera after looking at models by Fuji and Sony also. The price and features on the Olympus made it the winner. The image quality is great and the LCD is sharp and clear. Image processing is a little slow at higher quality, but the standard quality should be just fine for most users. This camera seems a little battery hungry to me, although it is my first camera so I do not have anything to compare it to. I would like to see some improvement in the 2x zoom, images become a little blurry at 2x and if using the LCD it is very shaky. Overall, this is a great camera at a good price, there a lots of accessories available. I would definitely recommend purchasing an A/C adapter for this camera.<br><br>
