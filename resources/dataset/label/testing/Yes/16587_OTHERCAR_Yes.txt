            I love photography, plain and simple.  Recently I decided to add to my arsenal of photo equipment, a new digital camera.  As I wasn't planning on using it for some of professional work, I didn't want to spend over $500.00 dollars on a camera.  I decided to shop around, and get a feel for what was out there, and finally decided on the Sony DSC-P50.  I'm getting way more than I was expecting.

I've owned two previous digital cameras, and always thought of them as no more than a novelty, something I could shoot quick snapshots on, and print the results immediately, for family and friends.  Here's what happened since I purchased the Sony DSC-P50.

I'm actually using this camera for things like candid wedding photos, the pictures I take around Manhattan to be used for my small postcard business, impromptu portraits, and even some bust shots for a friends portfolio.  Now why am I telling you all of this?  Very simple, I want people to understand just what a workhorse this little 2.1megapixel is, and the possibilities for great pictures from even the most novice of photographers.

Before we get into the camera's great features, I want to share a little information about battery life.  From reading other reviews this has been the biggest complaint, in my humble opinion, I would have to believe that many of these are first time digital camera owners, as anyone with a digital camera knows, Alkaline batteries don't stand a chance.  The solution is easy and inexpensive, simply by a rechargeable Nickel Hydride battery set.  Most Battery makers sell these, they cost about 25.00 dollars.  With this purchase you get 4 AA NIH batteries that fully charge in about 5 to 7 hrs.   The DSC-P50 takes two batteries, and will give you about 1hr 15min battery life per set.   The other complaint is the small memory stick, and that�s valid.  For those who shoot uncompressed pictures  (TIFF mode) you�re only going to get one or two pictures.  The good news is, memory is cheap now, and you can pick up a gigantic 128mb memory stick for about $50 to $60 dollars.

Though the DSC-P50 is a point and shoot camera, it offers an array of features that allow you to create your own environment.   There are settings to change exposure, resolution, film speed, white balance, auto focus override, picture quality, file types, there are even special effects settings.  The LCD viewer though small, is bright and clear and easily visible even in bright light.   If you don�t want to use the LCD the Sony DSC-P50 has a manual viewfinder, just be mindful of parallax view (meaning that the view you see in the viewfinder will be slightly different than the actually exposure area of the lens.   Other features include a crisp 3X optical lens, with a 37-millimeter screw mount.  If you want to purchase a useful extra with this camera, for about $50.00 dollars you can purchase a 2X teleconverter, which doubles the focal length of the lens.

This is a wonderful camera, its feature rich, functional, and affordable.  Couple this camera with a good inkjet printer, and image editing program such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro 7, and you will have your own little home photo studio and processing center.
