            I was looking for a new car for my wife and could not beat what this new company had to offer on the 2000 Nubira CDX Wagon.  So I did some research and decided it was worth a try. I have had many cars from many makers and wanted to get a breath of fresh air for a change. Life is to short not to get an itch once in a while. Well after 1000 miles this car is still making me feel different in a good way. The only complaint I have is the cup holders could find another location instead of in front of my radio controls. The rest of the car performs beyond my desires. To drive this vehicle I can only say sporty and responsive. The ABS break system I had to put into action about a week ago in a rain storm and I was surprised how well it handled. It sure did prevent a bad situation. One thing I am getting a little tired of is  people on the highway getting to close to my rear end to see what kind of car I am riding in. This should end once more people start to see them around. The people that might want to consider the car I purchased would be a family of four that wants the world but just don't want to take upon them the national debt. The people that should not buy this vehicle is the younger generation. I would hate to see my insurance go up. HA! HA! <br><br>
