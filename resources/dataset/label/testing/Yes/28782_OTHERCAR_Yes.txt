            I bought the DSC-S75 in December 2001. I decided on this camera after researching several different digital cameras. After using the camera for over 7 months, I am still very satisfied with my purchase.

<b>In the beginning</b>
When I bought the camera, I purchased a lens adapter and a clear filter to protect the lens. This cost an additional $80 or so, but a worthwhile investment to protect the Carl-Zeiss lens. The lens adapter screws into the camera body (the lens receptacle is threaded, a definite plus) and enables the lens to zoom in and out through the adapter. The filter screws on the end of the adapter. This filter prevents the lens from getting scratched and dust/dirt from entering the camera. 

Now that I was all set-up, I began to take pictures. My initial shots were a little off-color. After doing some research, I found that I had not set that the white-balance correctly. I had changed the white-balance from the <i>default</i> value of automatic to outside (and then shooting inside). Once, I corrected this, my pictures were great.

I began taking simple shots of people sitting still, group shots and landscapes. The DSC-S75 did a great job of producing sharp pictures. I then moved on to more <i>action</i> type photos. I have a 2 year-old daughter and am able to capture her most of the time in action. On this note, I have used several different brands of digital cameras (Canon, Kodak) and the DSC-S75 had the least amount of delay between depressing the button to take the picture and when the shot is captured. This is important when trying to take pictures of fast-moving objects (e.g. young children). 

I also used the MPEG movie feature. This is a feature lacking in numerous models of digital cameras, but has proved very useful. Although it only captures ~21 minutes of video (on a 128 M card), that is more than enough. I am able to capture 2-3 minutes of video at such events as Christmas morning (coming down the stairs), birthday parties, and even of the animals at the zoo. The amount of video is great because it equates to about the same amount of time people are willing to tolerate in watching home videos. (You can then take these videos and upload them to a web site to share. Without using streaming video/audio, I have a 10M video on my site (about 2 minutes) and it will begin to play in less than 10 seconds over a DSL/Cable/LAN connection).

<b>After a few months</b>
After using the camera for a few months, I purchased an additional battery (~$50) and a 128 M Memory Stick (~$120). I also invested in a polarizing lens. The polarizing lens allows me to adjust the color of pictures and eliminate a lot of the washed out look, I tended to get in pictures taken in bright sunlight. I took the camera to Europe and came home with 225 pictures that looked great.

<b>Some things to consider</b>
The DSC-S75 is a Sony product so that implies it contains some <i>quirks</i>. First, it uses a proprietary battery. That means you must buy the Sony brand (or compatible) battery and cannot use standard AA/AAA batteries. I have not had a problem with this as I bought a back-up battery (from Sears $55/or I purchased it online for $42). In my experience, the batteries provide 2-3 hours of shooting/reviewing and have never had one run-out. If you plan before you go out (i.e. charge up your battery, or take the charger with you on vacation) you should not have any problem. Second, the DSC-S75 uses the Sony brand Memory Stick. A definite downside is that the camera comes with a mere 8 M stick. This should be your first <i>additional</i> purchase. I purchased my 128 M stick in March 2002 for ~$120. I imagine you can get it for under $100 now. This size allows for 200+ images using 1600x1200 size. I also bought an additional 64 M Stick for back-up. Another downside is the lens cap. The lens cap provided did not fit the lens adapter/filter I bought so I had to use a cleaning cloth to cover and protect the filter. However, after 3 months of this, I made a trip to my local camera store and bought a lens cap for $3.95 that fit perfectly.

<b>Connecting to the computer</b>
I have connected to both a laptop and desktop with no problem. I plugged in the USB cable and turned on the camera. Both machines immediately recognized the camera and I could browse the pictures. On an additional note, I would recommend getting a <i>decent</i> photo-editing program. I use the Roxio PhotoSuite 4.0 Platinum addition (~$49.99). Being I am only a recreational photographer (I take pictures of my vacations and family), I did not have use for a high-end photo suite (PhotoShop) and wanted something easy to use. PhotoSuite has a very simple interface and makes correcting images quick and painless. It allows you to apply a general enhancement to correct the overall picture, remove red eye, remove blemishes from people, remove scratches, adjust lighting, correct color. I have found I can make any image, at the very least acceptable, if not excellent. One of the more interesting things is the clone tool, which I used liberally to remove <i>extraneous</i> people from photos, highway overpasses, or signs.

<b>Printing</b>
I do not have a printer capable of printing digital pictures. I use www.snapfish.com. They are very prompt and (from my research) provide the lowest cost. What is unique about the site, is that they offer a sliding scale of pricing. The more images you ave printed, the less each print costs. I uploaded about 200 pictures and received them in less than a week. The convenient thing about this is that I was able to quickly place these in an album, chronologically, in less than 1 hour. The quality of prints was excellent and even did a great job on enlargements.
