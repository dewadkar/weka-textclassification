                We have all thought that Caddy's are for older men and women. Not true anymore. This ride is sweet. I am a 25 year old, with a Cadillac. My friends are always calling me up saying you want to go pick up some women. Chicks dig this truck guys.
    My Escalade has had no problems since I bought it. I have added some newer features that make it look even better. Tinted the windows, added new Carrera rims, new tires, drooped it 1 inch, added t.v's in the back of the headrests, also with better speakers.
    The SUV is very powerful. The engine is great in stop and go driving. But also great for the ride in the country. My friends have Explorers and Expeditions and have wanted to race. My SUV topped out at about 129 mph. I was so amazed. 
    I can fit 5 fully grown men in the Caddy. Also room for all of our golf clubs. The back or cab has a lot of room for keeping all your toys. My SUV has pulled 2 waver runners without a problem and without drinking all my gas.
    My SUV doesn't drink that much gas as do the Expedition, Excursion, 4 runner, Land Cruiser. 

I have recommended my Caddy to all my friends. I have bought 2 for my company. I have fallen in love with my new SUV. People are also coming up to me and asking me about how is drives, how many people fit in it, is it a family car, how fast, did it come like that?
