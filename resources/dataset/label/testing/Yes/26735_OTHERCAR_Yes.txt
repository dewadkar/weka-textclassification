            I am really happy with my Olympus D360L digital camera.  At the time of purchase it was the best for the money. ($299.99)  Now, about 9 months later, both Olympus and other brands have come up with new cameras in the same price range.  Some reach 2.3+ megapixels, but I�m still happy with my camera.  It kept up with the latest technology, and is still a current model selling for the same price.  
I�ve taken hundreds of pictures with the D-360L and they all have came out great.  Pictures taken while the object is in motion are slightly blurry, but that can be expected with all cameras.  The 1.3 megapixel resolution is enough for most people to take clear pictures, comparable to 35mm.  
As for advanced features, this camera is great.  Sure it�s not like the $1000 Sony I�ve used, but for $300 you can�t beat it.  My favorite is the TV out, which allows you to view/edit/delete your pics on any TV with a yellow video input.  Other features digital viewfinder, five different flashes for different conditions, auto flash, 30 second shot timer, your choice of recording modes and resolutions, panorama mode, sequence mode, index display of all images on LCD, delete all photos, slide show, and many more.
The 1.8� LCD monitor is clear enough to preview images to see if they�re centered, but does not have a high enough resolution to check for anything in detail.  
The camera comes with an 8mb smart media card, and can be used with cards up to 64mb.  
Last, the camera comes with the Olympus photo editing software.  The program is enough to select pics to download to your pc, and it is very simple to do.  However, the program isn�t very good to edit the photos.  I�d recommend you buy a photo editing program, such as PhotoSuite or PhotoShop to get best use of your camera.  
I think I covered everything.  The camera is good for the money, and I would recommend it.  The photos have came out great, and I�m very happy with my purchase.
