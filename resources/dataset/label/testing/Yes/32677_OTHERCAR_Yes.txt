            I bought my station wagon because of the price and gas mileage.  It was my first brand new car.  I loved it from the beginning, smooth ride, room in the back and great mileage.  We took the car back only once after we bought the car for the back seat being stuck and a screw missing from the radio console.  It was an inconvenience, but we didn't have to wait long.

Then just before 60,000 miles hit, things started going wrong.  Everything needed to be replaced including the engine chain.  Very few mechanics know about chains because they aren't in many cars yet.  So, I took it to the dealer.  When I asked the salesman about the price of changing the chain before I bought the car, he said, &quot;only a little more than a belt&quot;.  I couldn't believe the price.  They wanted 10 times the amount of an engine belt.  But I had to pay it.  It is a reliable car, but the maintenance is a lot.<br><br>
