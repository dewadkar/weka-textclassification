            Nissan Altima?  No way?  I've had one?  Saw it every time I turned around.  Everyone had one.  And besides we love the Nissan Pathfinder. Well, my husband prevailed.  We did not need the larger vehicle.  We did not need the extra expense and the mileage was not the best.  Of course, those were not mom's prerequisites.  Mom loved the Pathfinder's luxury and space especially when hauling all those baseball players to and from ball games.

Enter the picture, mom's favorite 15 year old.  EXtera was the car this year and he just had to have it.  So we three went looking, mom, dad and son.  EXtera was cute and sporty and the perfect car for son.  Mom was not convinced--no leather seats, no sun roof but it was cute.  Dad was looking at the price tag, of course.

So decision was tough!  price versus luxury versus cute and sporty!   Altima entered the picture!  Decision was easy!  Price was perfect!  Luxury was there in leather seats, CD player, sun roof and style in both the body  exterior and interior features.  As for my 15 year old, once he got behind the wheel he was convinced--what power!  Driving was so smooth and take off so neat!  We three were sold!  And we are enjoying our Altima.<br><br>
