            Being a seventeen year old senior in high school, the idea of schlepping my parent's Ford Taurus stationwagon to school everyday was not exactly exciting to me, but hey, its a car!  As it turns out, I love the wagon.  Sure I'd rather be cruising around in a BMW convertible or at least a cute Honda civic, but the wagon sure has done its job.  Its perfect for driving 6 underclassmen with field hockey equipment to our games and I almost never have to say &quot;sorry I'm all full.&quot;  When my best friend moved out of her house after she graduated, we fit her entire room in my trunk.  It also gets great gas mileage and has a huge reserve tank.  I can, and have, driven for days on empty.  Not only that, but the taurus is extremely durable.  I have gotten in two minor accidents and neither have caused any damage to my car.  Also, it is extremely hard to break into.  I know this because I have locked my keys in the car four times, twice with the engine on.  One time, I couldn't reach my parents so we had to call a professional.  It took him forever to get in!  The negative aspects of the wagon are mostly that it is too big and that is has minor technical problems.  It may just be that I have only been driving for about a year, but I always have trouble parking and pulling out with the big ass that car has.  Its hard for me to judge how close I am and I am always scared I will hit something.  Also, sometimes when i am driving, the &quot;check engine&quot; light will go on.  My dad took it in to figure out why and they basically said that it didnt mean anything.  But, I still have to deal with that light going on all the time!  Also, it recently stopped working for no apparent reason, but we got it fixed.  The only other problem I have had is that the cup holders suck.  But otherwise, the Taurus stationwagon is an overall good car and I recommend it to any family.<br><br>
