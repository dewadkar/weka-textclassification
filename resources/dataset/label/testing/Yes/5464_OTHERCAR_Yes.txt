            I came dangerously close to buying a minivan.  With children and a camper to pull I had definite requirements in a vehicle.  The &quot;mini sport-utes&quot; couldn't pull enough weight to be safe tow machines and were frankly too small for a growing family.  

I found my Discovery at the local Land Rover dealer, I was immediately smitten.  My truck was used commercially as an off-road tour &quot;bus&quot; and is equipped with a custom bumper, winch, roof rack, and off road tires.  I regularly am out in the bush climbing over the hills and this truck was made for this sort of treatment!  I have had several comments from owners of other brands of 4X4 at how well the Discovery &quot;handles&quot; in the rough stuff.  The only downside is that the small V8 drinks gas like a small V8... (not really surprising).  And like many other vehicles the rear door opens the wrong way. (it's the right way for right hand drive, hey it's from England, just part of the charm!).  I don't really hate anything about the truck, I bought it as a camping truck, not as a status symbol.  However I have never owned a car that got so MANY looks!

I love the seating position and the ABS brakes work well on and off road. The ride is plush and you can almost forget this is a 4X4.  There is some body lean in corners but it is well controlled, (like ANY tall car you slow down for corners), the truck tracks quite well when it is windy.  Towing my trailer puts no strain on the truck.  On hills it is necessary to downshift or you lose speed.  There is tire and gear noise audible inside the truck but not a horrible amount.  This is like has been mentioned before an off-road vehicle made to work on the street, not the other way around.  

The only problems I have had are, the cruise control stopped working, (fixed under warranty) and the clutch slave cylinder failed. (after warranty but less than $200Cdn)

If you like to get the BEST picnic spots and love to get out of the city, this truck is for you, if you are looking for something to just go to the mall the Discovery is very capable but horribly under used.  If you are never going to get it dirty, why bother with a truck?<br><br>
