            I bought my '96 Neon Sport last year after a terrible accident totaled my Hyundai Excel.  I must say that the switch from a Hyundai Excel to a Dodge Neon is like switching from a sugar cookie to death by chocolate!  I absolutely love my Neon.  
This car is so much more reliable.  It handles very well, gets great gas mileage and accelerates so much better than my old car.  The engine is quiet, it warms up very quickly, and the the interior is very comfortable. Plus, even fully loaded, this car was very affordable.  It's not a luxury car, but it has lots of room, and if you're looking for trunk space, the Neon has it! My particular model came with anti-lock brakes, air bags on both sides, power everything and a CD/Stereo. <br><br>
