            The Ford Contour replaced the Ford Tempo as Ford's &quot;tweener&quot;, bridging the gap between the compact and durable Ford Escort and the larger and more expensive Ford Taurus.  For a car under $15,000, it provides many solid features like air conditioning, cassette deck, rear window defroster and many more.  I really enjoy the handling of the vehicle, it's much better than I would have expected for a moderately priced auto that with no pretensions of being a sports car.  The driver's seat is quite comfortable, even after a hectic 1500 mile in two days there and back trip to Minnesota from Michigan my backside felt surprisingly good.  The trunk room is adequate, though I don't think it's very deep and it makes it difficult at times to accommodate larger products such as a 27&quot; TV that would more readily fit in the trunk of say a Taurus.  Another fault is the overall poor acceleration of the Contour, I find it to be quite sluggish on the highway, but what can you expect out of a 4 cylinder engine?  Also, the window and door controls(handles, handcrack knob for the windows on mine) have a VERY cheap feel to them, though so far they have held up just fine.  On the whole though, it's a very good value, I'm just being nit-picky so you'll know what you can expect.<br><br>
