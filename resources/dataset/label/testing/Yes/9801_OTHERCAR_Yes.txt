            Should I buy a used Lincoln? I've asked myself the same question a hundred times, until I finally did. A 1997 Lincoln Town Car  with 17K miles. Boy, did I do the right thing. 
I have driven many automobiles in my lifetime and can truly say, it is the class of them all, in my opinion. 5 Year, 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. Great Ford 8 cylinder engine. Runs of regular 87 octane gasoline and gets great mileage. (20 m.p.g. city driving and 24 m..p g. Highway). Handles like a dream, corners beautiful, great pick-up, tremendous ride. What more can I say?????
If I had to say one thing negative about this automobile, it would be that it tends to run away, if you don't pay attention to your driving. The ride is so smooth that you tend to take your mind off driving and the speed will crawl right up there on you, unless, that is, you get in the habit of using your speed control.<br><br>
