            After months of researching, test driving, consultations with the Minister of Finance (my wife), we finally bought our 99 Chevy Silverado Extended cab.  The first one we drove impressed us greatly.  I am a bonefide Chevy lover, so I feared my first impression would be prejudiced toward the Chevy.  We drove the Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra, and just for fun, the GMC Sonoma.  Please read my previews of these trucks.  I will go into what I love about the Silverado.  My opinion of the styling is one of fondness, but the truth is I like the looks of the Ford better.  I opted for the 4.8L Vortech engine for insurance purposes, but I honestly cannot tell the difference between mine and trucks with the 5.3L engine.  I only tow motorcycles, but the truck never misses a beat up in the Sierra Nevadas'.  It may shift out of overdrive (4th gear) when the cruise is on, but even then it is only turning 2500 rpm at 70 mph.  The LS model has the upgraded seats, 6 way power with manual lumbar adjust, and in my opinion are the best of any of the large trucks.  Interior noise is very low, but we did have wind noise from the quarter windows the first month we had it.  The noise cleared up on it's own.  The ride is generally excellent, but on California's concrete slab highways it has an unsettling &quot;porpoising&quot;.  I have ridden in other trucks that do this. It is caused by the length of the truck being longer than the sections of road.  
   All in all, the Chevy truck was the best all around truck, with the Dodge being dated, the Ford riding uncomfortably, and the Toyota being priced like an exotic car.  The GMC Sonoma is nice, but too small for our purposes.<br><br>
