            I recently purchased a Maroon 1994 Ford Probe GT 5-spd with 77,000 miles for $5,000. Before I brought the car home, I left it with my mechanic for a week and told him to fix whatever he could find wrong. When I got the car back it had new Brake Rotors/Pads, 4 new Dayton HR 225/50R16 high performance Tires, and a new alternator. I figured better to have the work done before I got used to driving the car daily. The performance of this car cannot be summarized with 0-60 times and Horsepower numbers. It is extremely well balanced, and very surefooted. I used to own a 1996 Acura Integra VTEC GS-R. The Probe feels very similar to the acura except for the lower redline and broader torque band. Off the line, the probe is quick, but should not be confused with a Red light racer like a Z-28 or Mustang GT. Either of those cars would probably hurt your feelings from the line, but at speed and on a curvy road, the Probe will easily hold it's own. It's light, responsive, great looking, and provides a lot of Bang for the Buck. The Probe will have you entering corners at ridiculous speeds just for the hell of it. If you enjoy spirited driving with pretty good fuel economy, and don't mind keeping up with the higher maintenance costs of a sports car... I recommend the Probe GT.
