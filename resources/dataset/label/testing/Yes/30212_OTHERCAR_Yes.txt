            I bought this truck new as a second car. It soon became my daily driver. I have the V6 and it is a real strong engine. I have over 240,000 miles on it and I have no intention selling it. I drive it mostly for work now and I know that I give it a real workout. There is almost always a load on it and I use it for pulling trailers. You have to be careful not to pull too large of load. Because the engine will pull about any thing but you can over load the brakes. Its okay for short tips with not more than one passenger. Three people of any size cant ride with any comfort. The paint is still in good shape and I have not had the air conditioning serviced sense I bought it and it is still cold. It is a great work truck or as a first car. It is not a good family car but could work for a second car.<br><br>
