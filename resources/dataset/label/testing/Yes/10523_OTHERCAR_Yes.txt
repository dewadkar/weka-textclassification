            This car is great for the money that you pay.  It also gives you the sport shift for giving you the manual transmission &quot;feel&quot; while still giving you an automatic transmission ride.  The car is great all round and is well built for the price you pay, I would not say that it is the greatest thing in the world but does just fine.  The sport shift can be slow at times and doesn't give you all the flexibility that a manual transmission would but it is sufficient for &quot;playing&quot; when you need to.  The ride is generally good and is quite quiet but there is quite a bit of wind noise at higher speeds and the suspension is a little too soft for those spirited rides.  So if you are looking for a good buy and an entry into the luxury cars...this is the car to get.<br><br>
