            Love my SC400.  When I purchased my car, the Dealer thought the SC300 (V6)might be better suited to my &quot;female driving habits&quot;, but I'm quite happy I decided on the SC400 (V8).  As fast as I may go, the car remains smooth and quiet.  I find the car very comfortable, and others often comment that the back seats are more spacious than they first appear. The &quot;pearly white&quot; paint, in conjunction with the chrome package provide a classy look.  The car can remember 2 seat positions - you'll never know how great a feature this is until the day you find the perfect setting and someone proceeds to &quot;adjust&quot; the seat for themselves.  Though I didn't get the Nakamichi Sound System, the standard sound system is rather nice, and I love my 12 disc changer!  What really attracted me to the car was it's sleek, simple look.  The lines are minimal and I feel the look of this car will withstand the trendy changes seen year to year.  Furthermore, I like the simplicity of the inside controls.  Everything is where you would expect it to be; it's ergonomically correct.  While the luxuries are all there, there seem to be no unnecessary extras.  Finally, the car remains dependable several years post purchase.<br><br>
