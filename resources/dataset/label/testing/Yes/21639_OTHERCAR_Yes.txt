            The new 2002 Kia Spectra is a classy great looking car. Its ride is quite and smooth.  It is a four door car and has alot of room inside the car. The seats are very cozy also soft but yet firm. The trunk is very spacious with a large opening. It makes it easier to put large items in the trunk. The back seat lays down to make hauling large items easy. It has plenty of lights in the front. Two bright lights on each side in the front in addition to the standard dome light. It has a space to put sunglasses making them easily to get when driving. The only thing I don't like is it is hard to see behind you when you turn your head to look behind (like if you are changing lanes)all you see is a head rest. It has a bad blind spot that could easily cause a accident.  It does have good side mirrors and a big rearview mirror.
