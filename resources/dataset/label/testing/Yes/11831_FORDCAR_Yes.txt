            We bought a 1996 Taurus this year because we needed a reliable car for my husband, who was driving an old truck.  We got a great deal for such a late-model car, since it had 112,000 miles on it.

It's a great color - a shiny royal blue, and it has a nice interior.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not been uncomfortable in the seats, in spite of some long road trips.  The interior is roomy, the dashboard is stylish, and the stereo is nice.  As another review mentioned, the stereo is not replaceable, however, since it is oval-shaped.

Our experience with this car was great for the first few months, but then my husband was rear-ended by another car.  The cosmetic damage was slight; however, the car hasn't been the same since.  It makes a popping sound under the passenger floorboard when you make right-hand turns, and the dealership doesn't seem to know how to fix this.

However, the major problem is the transmission, which we have just had to replace.  Apparently, these transmissions are notoriously bad due to a faulty aluminum part that should have been made of steel.  I'm not sure if the wreck hastened its demise, or if it was completely inevitable, but suffice it to say that our $5600 used car has become much more expensive than we'd hoped...

We'll have to see how the new transmission does - it's a used one with 35,000 miles on it, but we've already noted that it doesn't shift as smoothly as one might expect, and shudders sometimes at lower speeds.

I recommend this as a used car to others because of its low resale value - you can get a really nice car for little money.  I do not recommend buying one new for the same reason - low resale.  However, if you buy this car used, you MUST factor into your buying decision the possibility of transmission problems and decide whether you will still come out ahead or even.  So far, I feel we've broken even.<br><br>
