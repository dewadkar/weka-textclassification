            I was fortunate enough to win a 1999 Miata in a national sweepstakes!  After waiting impatiently for several months, I was notified by the judging agency that they were upgrading the car to a 2000 model.  We were very excited because you can't BUY a 2000 Miata in our area at this time.  We finally took delivery in mid-December.  This car is a beauty!!  Emerald green in color with a black top.

What's nice about the new Miata is that the window in the back is no longer plastic -- you get real glass, which adds a sleeker and classier look.  Everything inside is first class -- from the digital odometer to the AM/FM/CD player.

What I don't like about the Miata is the cramped space.  It is a super small car!  My husband sat inside and tried to adjust the seat back so that his knees weren't hitting the dash -- only to find that the seat was already back as far as it could go.  While he might be able to travel a few miles in this vehicle, he could never go cross-country.

However, I might be tempted to leave without him!  This car is beautiful and sleek!  It's a blast to drive and always receives admiring looks from the drivers in the next car over!  If you are ready for some fun, this car is for you!!<br><br>
