<TEXT>
            This is my second Trooper(I'm not too sure I should call it mine, my wife keeps refering to it as HER Trooper). I also have a 1990 which just toasted its engine after 176k miles. I'd been looking at various SUV's, when I saw a couple new Troopers marked down at the Isuzu dealer. I couldn't beat the price at 27k, including tax, so I bought it.
After over ten thousand miles in 6 mos., I've had no problems and have only had to go to the dealer for two recalls on the fuel system (I can't figure out why the factory couldn't get it right with the first recall), and the normal 7500 mile sevice. That is more than I could say for some vehicles, like my 98 KIA Sephia (but that's another story.)

My Likes:
 	  adequate power
	  shift on the fly (TOD)
	  security system (it lowers my insurance)
	  limited slip rear end
	  ruggedness - based on experience with my '90 and my son's old '84.
	  heated mirrors (its winter now in NY)
	  split fold-down rear seat - good for carrying a load and a couple of passengers.
	  interior size and layout
	  very good warrenty
	  ease of entry (a little high, but easier entry than the Jeeps) 	  reliability - if this proves to be even nearly as good as my 90, or my son's former 84, it will be very good (I blame my 90's engine failure on my own neglect - the valves hadn't ever been adjusted since I got it.)
	  off-road abilty - not as good as my son's old Cherokee (more tipsy), but well suited to the terrain in this area. Just don't try side-hilling.
	  Price - cheaper than a comparably-equiped Cherokee.
	  Dealer service - My dealership is extremely good.

My personal dislikes:
	  lack of steering feel near dead center. Did I get transported back to 1960?
	  lack of adequate thigh support - seats are distinctly uncomfortable after about 45 minutes.
	  Poor ride - it's no better that my 90, and not as good as my son's 84 Trooper was. Compared to the comfort of my son's 84 Cherokee, I'd say that Isuzu should be able to do better.
	  fuel economy - I'm only getting 17-19 mpg so far, although that's only about 2 less than my 90 Trooper (a 4-cyl manual).
	  heavy rear door/spare tire - I'd almost prefer the spare mounted inside as in the Jeep.
	  OEM tires - they're terrible in mud or off-road, and not really good on road, although, they are really good in some snow conditions.
	  
	  When then rear seats are folded, the front seatbacks are forced into an uncomfortable position. (We're all good sized , and we can't really put the seats forward.)
	  Lack of a 4wd high-range lock position - If you need to back out in four wheel drive, you've got to be in low range. This is a real design problem, since in mud,  you can't get adequate wheel spin (to clear the mud from the tread) in low range, and auto-mode won't put any torque to the front if you're in reverse. This is about the only area where the old part time system (pre-95) is much better.
	  Weight - like most SUVs, it's about 600 lbs too heavy. A few less toys, it would be much better of road. But then, even if you do a lot of off-roading, you'll probably be on the road 85 to 90% of the time.

Would I recommend it? Definitely! It's a truely practical vehicle. But don't let its outward appearence decieve you, it isn't a luxury wagon. It's a rugged station wagon based on an older truck design, and will serve you very well but not very comfortably, unless you change those seats. Most of my impressions are applicable to my '90 as well (except the TOD 4wd system), and that says something about how similar the two are. There aren't any interchangable parts between them, but there is no mistaking the fact that they're cut from the same cloth, and I really like my '90.
