            I have now owned my CR-V for 3.5 years and I still love it.  I have 34k miles on it and have never had to bring it in for repairs except for the routine checkups & oil changes.  

When I started looking for a new car I knew I wanted four wheel drive and plenty of room.  I live in Vermont and we get lots and lots of snow and there is no place you can go without having to go up & down hills.  I wanted to feel a little more at ease in all these snowstorms.  This vehicle has definitely lived up to my expectations!  I have never gotten stuck in the snow or felt like I was not going to make it up a hill.  I bought this car in January and went through the entire next winter with the all season tires that came on it. I didn't feel like I was going through the snow as well that 2nd winter so I bought I set of good snow tires.  Remember I am in VT where getting over a foot of snow at once is not unusual and in fact is sometimes a weekly occurrence.  If you don't live in snow country you most likely wont need those extra tires.  I have had no problems at all in the snow and I have gone through some pretty deep stuff on roads that have not been plowed!

The interior of this car is nice.  The rear seats go down very easily and they are very comfortable.  You can even adjust the backrest for more of an incline or to sit straight up.  My parents especially like this because my Dad is over 6' and likes to lean back where my mother likes to sit with a straight back.  There is tons of headroom -there is even a few inches over my father's head even with a baseball cap on!  The stereo has a single CD player and I must say it can go LOUD.  My husband is even impressed by how loud it can go.  He likes his music loud and he doesn't even turn it up all the way.  This vehicle has 6 cup holders!  How many cars have that?  2 in the front, 2 in the middle fold down console (also very neat feature) and 2 on the rear passenger doors. The floor mats are also a nice bonus.  The mats cover the middle section of the floor as well.  Usually the middle section gets worn down if you have 3 passengers in the back a lot, but not in the CR-V. Their back mat goes clear across from one side to the other.  Very nice.

The couple of things I don't like with the CR-V are -  Highway driving is a bit noisy, but it isn't extremely loud.  Usually the radio or cd covers up this noise.  My husband also thinks that the tilting steering wheel could have more of a range.  The difference from all the way up tilt to the bottom tilt really isn't that much difference.

I must say though the one thing Honda advertised as a great feature is the one thing I have yet to use.  The CR-V has it's own picnic table.  (The rear floor behind the back seats comes out and has folding legs.)  I guess it would be a great feature if you went tenting a lot.  It is one of a kind though.

All in all I am extremely happy with this vehicle and when it is time to get another I would definitely consider another CR-V, but that won't be for years because this vehicle is holding up so well.  Even my Golden Retriever loves this vehicle because it is so roomy and if I put a seat down for him he can really stretch out.
