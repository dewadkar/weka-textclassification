            Overall, my experience with the Chevy Beretta has been a good and a bad one.  When I first bought the car used, it would shudder when it got to around 50 miles per hour, and then the transmission would kick into place and the rest of the ride would be smooth.  This was fixed with a tune up and now it only shudders when it reaches around 80 miles an hour.  The car is roomy in the front, but as a suggestion, leave the long legged people at home if they would have to ride in the back seat.  The trunk can store plenty, it is very roomy.  Also, the car does very well on gas and it has put up with my wear and tear of over 40000 miles a year on the poor thing.  The paint holds up well and when you slightly brush up against something or bump into something, there are hardly any noticable dents, unlike the newer models which seem to dent very easily.  This car is good for a first car, and is still sporty looking enough for teenagers to whip around in.<br><br>
