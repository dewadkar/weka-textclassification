            We bought the 2001 Solara as a replacement for a stolen truck, so didn't have too much time to shop around for the features we wanted, and still take advantage of end of the year clearance sales. We are still extremely happy with the car we bought. It is a Silver Stream, 4 cylinder, automatic transmission, with the only extra being the carpet kit the dealer had added. 

It has the standard Toyota Solara sound system, a 3-way cassette, AM/FM radio, single CD player with 6 speakers. The sounds produced by this factory unit are fantastic. The location is high on the center console, in easy view and reach of the driver or passenger. The controls are very straightforward and easy to use, and its display large and simple. I do not like to take my eyes off the road when driving, and this unit allows for a quick, easy glance to change the function from CD to radio to tape.  

The charcoal gray, cloth seats are extremely comfortable. The driver's seat has knobs to change the seat tilt and back angle in easy reach on the left side of the seat. The knobs turn quite easily allowing for easy changing. On the right side is a swing handle for adjusting the lumbar support. This is also fairly easy to turn to make any desired changes. It seats 4 very comfortably. Adding a third adult to the back seat makes it a bit snug shoulder-wise, but not uncomfortably so. The legroom in the back is more than sufficient according to a 6 footer who sat back there. 

The 4-cylinder engine is the only thing we may have changed given the choice, but it has proven itself quite worthy. A good bit of my daily commute being on a mountainous toll road, the 2.2 liter 4-cylinder holds its own going up hill with no shifting, where a previous 4 cylinder Mazda was constantly downshifting to reach the peak. In the past two months of owning the car, we are getting mostly around 25 miles to the gallon. 

The ride is very smooth, with a minimum of road noise. The Solara has the sound dampening features common in the Lexus and has been extremely quiet riding so far. The car holds a good straight path with no intervention on our part, no drifting at all. One complaint we have read about is a lack of road feel in the steering. Although there is not very much road feel, the steering is responsive and accurate. It does feel like you are in control, rather than drifting. 

The instrument cluster is easy to read, well lit at night, and has gauges rather than idiot lights. We are overall very happy with our new Toyota Solara and feel like we got more car than the $17,700 price afforded. We would definitely recommend this car very highly to anyone looking to purchase a new car. The aftermarket addition of mud flaps eliminated the road grime behind the wheel wells. And the aftermarket window tinting made for a very sharp looking car.

An update after a year and a few months ... the Solara is still loved. Not a problem to date with it. The only thing I wish I had done different was an after-market Clifford alarm instead of the dealer installed Audiovox alarm. Audiovox uses a battery size in its remote that can only be found at Radio Shack. Should Radio Shack stop carrying this battery, I may be in for that Clifford alarm. Otherwise, the car still runs smoothly, the radio sounds great, it doesn't skip when playing CD's, it looks like new inside and out with regular cleaning, it runs quiet, and it holds the road very well. We did step up to the 16" alloy wheels and Dunlop Sport tires which hold the road quite well in rain at the expense of a slight bit of road noise, but not unbearably so. I would still highly recommend the Solara as an extremely dependable, nice riding, nice handling car.
