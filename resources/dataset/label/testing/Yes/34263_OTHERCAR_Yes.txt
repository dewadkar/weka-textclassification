            I'm a Leaser (I like the Write-offs) So when I look at for A Car I look for INSTANT gratification. I just got out of a BMW 5 series and was looking to Downsize (Price wise) and this Kind of Bothered me. I wanted Sport but also luxury and I Didn't really want to comprise either. I Test drove BMW's, Mercedes, I even went so far as to drive a Boxster a couple of times (But there I had to compromise). I was getting frustrated and Confused Until... I walked into a Landrover showroom looking for an SUV for my wife. This place also happened to be a Jag dealer and there it was - A Black on Black X-Type fully loaded. I had not even considered Jag before but my curiosity got the best of me. 

The front of the car was - well just plain Gorgeous - the Back however looked - well like a Ford Contour. Talk about mixed emotions. That all went away however once I drove it. 

Lets address the Interior first. This was a Sport addition and had the Really contoured sport seats, which hugged my body and were so comfortable and accommodating. (Iï¿½m 6'1" 230lbs and I'm no Body-builder) The Gauges were laid out perfectly and the Body of the Car was tight. The Interior Luxuries where all Jaguar and the Connelly Leather sure was soft. It just felt GREAT. 

Now it was time to drive. I started the car with a Throaty Purr of the 3.0 Inline 6. Just tuff enough sounding to let you know your not in a "cream puff" Jag. This was a Manual Transmission, which is what I was looking for, and it rivaled if not surpassed the Shifting of the BMW. I stepped on the gas and was amazed at the Zippiness (Is that spelled right?) of this new Jag. This was a car to Really Drive - It Handle superbly with its all wheel drive and the 17" wheels didn't hurt either. It definitely gave the "I'm a sport car" impression, yet stopped at light, you can barely tell the car is running. It was responsive, tight, and yet had a refinement of a JAG. Actually I was a bit surprised at the stiff suspension, I wasn't prepared to feel the bumps in a JAG. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just expected a Cushy(er) ride. Leaving the Showroom I thought that this car was as nice as my BMW. 

1 week later when I had to make my decision, I could not get the way that I felt in the JAG out of my head. It coddled you inside and gave you a thrill ride outside. That was my car. I didn't quite get the whole downsizing thing accomplished (Sticker on the one I got was $43,500) But I got a Great deal on the lease and I got them to throw in a couple of service perks. 

It has now been 1 1/2 months since a drove it out of the dealer and I still cannot get enough of the comfort and sportiness of this car. I'm still not 100% sold on the Outside styling but its growing on me and the Tinted windows does wonders. This choice definitely makes me happy. 

However - I have run into slight somewhat minute problems - The computer controlled Sunroof has not been right since I got the Car - I've had in twice and expect it to break again. The Airbag warning light keeps flashing also. Other than that, No complaints. 

If you are looking for a Sporty car with plenty of Speed Luxury, and is truly (at least now) unique, this is the Car for you.
