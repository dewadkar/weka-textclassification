            It seems to me that the best time to visit Las Vegas is in May.  Late spring is still early enough in the year to avoid the triple-digit heat of the desert, but late enough to allow for the extended daylight hours and weather that makes the femininas wear shorts.  It also seems to me that the best place to stay while in Vegas is downtown.  the strip is grossly overpriced and filled with poseurs, tourists, kids, and those annoying amusement park-like hotels.  It's enough to make your buffet filled gut start to churn.

So it was that Duende, Eggs and I joined a distant acquaintance for a weekend in Vegas.  His name was Ashraf, and Eggs knew him from some previous job or other.  In fact, it was Eggs that set this gig up.  It seems that Ashraf had some "business" he needed to attend to in Vegas for a weekend, and he was getting a suite at the <b>California</b> Hotel in downtown.  He invited Eggs to join him, and Eggs took the liberty of inviting us.  And off we went.

At first Ashraf was very close-mouthed about what his business in Vegas was, but then Duende and I really didn't give a rat's a*s.  We were heading there for a bit of gambling, and maybe (just maybe) a visit to the <b>Palomino</b> to wallow in the filth of male priviledge.  Eggs also had no idea what it was that Ashraf was up to, but then he isn't the most curious sort, and he was just along for the ride.

We arrvied on Friday afternoon, and checked in to our suite.  It was very plush, including two rooms, a huge-a*s bathroom, and a 32-inch TV.  Ashraf had obviously been there before, because he also told us that he had managed to secure us comps for breakfast the next day.  The night lay before us, and we were itching to get started. 

Duende and I occupied one of the rooms, while Eggs and Ashraf took the other.  We took a few moments to clean the drive off our faces, and went into the other room to see what was on the agenda for the evening.  While we sat on Eggs' bed we saw Ashraf unpacking his bag.  We noticed that he seemed to be carrying a lot of stuff for a weekend trip, and we soon found out why.  One of his ample bags was dedicated to cameras.  Video cameras, still cameras and digital cameras.  It was then that we saw him casually toss his <b>Canon PowerShot S10</b> on the bed (you thought I forgot about the camera, didn't you?).  Duende picked it up and poked at it much like a caveman would prod uncomprehendingly at a two-stroke motor.  I asked Ashraf why he had so many cameras, but he deflected my question with a non-committal answer to the effect of "I take a lot of pictures."  I would have pressed him, but I really didn't care.  It was now about 7:30 on Friday night, and we had some serious gambling and drinking to do.  It was then that Ashraf explained to us that he would probably not be seeing us much this weekend, and he bade us good luck.

That night we gambled.  Duende won about $20 playing the slots, Eggs dropped close to $35 on the same game, while I went down close to $200 before recouping and coming out even on blackjack.  We also got very happily toasted, as the waitresses were prompt and those Vodka Collins' do tend to add up.

Oh, but this is supposed to be a review of a camera, isn't it.  Okay, back to the topic.

The next day was spent doing more gambling and more drinking.  Sorry, but this is how the review goes.  You'll just have to bear with me.  By Saturday night we were good and tired, but realizing that our time was limited we were in no way going to spend the evening in the room.  Still, in order to have the slightest chance at winning money at the tables you do need to be able to count, and placing bets while tired and drunk is a sure-fire way to lose some serious cayshe.  We managed to catch up with Ashraf in the room after a very filling Buffet dinner and asked him what he was up to that night.  He again mentioned that he was working, but he seemed sympathetic to our plight and said he would arrange something for us.  He went to the phone in the other room and made a couple of calls, then came back a few minutes later telling us that we could go with him if we wanted.  He promised it would be worth our while, and so we agreed.  Twenty minutes later we went to the main doors and entered a limousine that whisked us away out into the desert.

It was then that we learned what it was that Ashraf was doing in Vegas, and where I got a chance to use the <b>Canon PowerShot S10</b>.  I have to admit that I found the camera to be very easy to use.  The buttons were laid out in a fairly intuitive fashion, and I was able to compose shots with either the viewfinder or via a 1.8" LCD screen.  Ashraf's camera had 24MB of RAM for image storage, which could hold more than 100 images.  The camera featured 2.1megapixel CCD with up to 1600X1200 resolution, which means some pretty sharp pictures.  The lens had a 35mm - 70mm focal length, so it was very versatile, and a f2.8 low aperture.  Overall a very handy piece of equipment.  The last good part about this camera was that it just felt good in my hand.  All of this was very handy, because it turned out that Ashraf was pressing us into service.

The mystery of Ashraf's business was soon solved as the limo pulled up to what looked to be an abandoned wearhouse in the middle of the desert.  We got out, and Ashraf pressed a button on a speaker, said something into the microphone, and then led us into the building.

As it turned out, this was no abandoned wearhouse.  It was a fully functioning club for adults of liberal attitude, and we had just stumbled onto a full-fledged orgy.  Duende finally pressed Ashraf on his business and he told us that he was involved in a pornographic web site, and he was here to "document" the events at this underground swingers club.  He gave Duende a camcorder and sent him to a corner, and he told me to just take pictures.  So I did.

I imagined myself to be some wild combination of Man Ray, Richard Avedon, and Ansel Adams.  I took close-up shots of butt-cheeks that looked like ziplocks filled with cottage cheese, flabby breasts hanging over rolls of stomach fat, gnarled hands groping puffy bodies, wrinkled mouths open in silent gasps of ecstasy, and other nameless putrid sights. 

So there I was, walking among a throng of surprisingly ugly people engaged in all manner of hedonistic sexual activity.  Now, I never thought about it, but it is funny how the colors and sights of the real world only seem real when looked at through the viewfinder of a camera.  I also never thought I would be stuck in the midst of an orgy and would have to fight every urge to run away.  The truth is that in real life, swingers are old and ugly.  They do not look anything like the fit, sculpted, fantasy dolls in dirty movies.  Not only that, but the symphony of grunts, moans, and other bodily sounds that float above a room full of screwing people is also revolting.  Add to that the unique stench that a blending of sweat, cologne, and excretory aroma creates and you have a trifecta of really gross things.

I made my way over to Duende, and we both agreed that we needed to get the hell out of there. The next day Ashraf was none too pleased about the fact that we ditched him so early in the game, but then again that was the sort of bad trip that we had absolutely no time for.  The drive home was quiet, mainly because I was asleep in the back of the car.  Supposedly the shots from the event have already been posted, but I don't either remember nor care to find out the URL.  If you are that interested just enter "Las Vegas Swinger's Clubs" in a search engine, you'll probably find it.  Just don't get mad at me if the people in the pictures are not the ones you want to see naked.
