            I am totally in love with my Escort.  I bought it for under 10,000 in Denver brand new.  A month later I drove it to Oregon when I retired from the Army.  A few days later, my wife, her mother and I drove to Alaska with it.  The car was very quiet and comfortable.  There was enough room in the back for 2 tents and 3 sleeping bags along with our camping junk.   I averaged over 40 mpg on that trip and I still average over 40 mpg.  Actually, when we were moving from Denver to Oregon, I was towing a trailer with my truck and my wife was following with the Escort.  I stopped for gas 150 miles later and my wife wanted to know why.  The truck was down to 1/4 tank but her gage still said full.  I had her fill it up in case the gage was not working but it only took 3 gallons.  I could only travel at 50 mph with the trailer and she was able to get 50 mpg at that speed.

I routinely drive 100 miles a day round trip to work and have had to change the tires many times.  I recommend getting Hankuk tires which are reasonably priced and will easily last the 80,000 mile guarantee.

My main complaint comes from the lighting system.  I have replaced a front headlight about every year until I started buying the ones that cost twice as much and they seem to last over twice as long.  The lights on my dashboard went out about 2 years ago and was able to get them working again by taking it to the shop but the repair man said that to replace the center console lights, it would be a complicated and expensive job so we are living without a light behind the temperature selector.  At least I know that left is for heat and right is for cool.

I have looked at other wagons but they want more than twice as much as I paid for mine.  I agree with other comments about the radio which I replaced almost immediately.  I put a trailer hitch on it at U-Haul and have towed a small trailer all the way to California and back and still got over 30 mpg at a reasonable 60 mph.

I go camping quite often and need to be able to sleep in my car which is why I got the wagon version.  When I went to Alaska, I bought one of those plastic roof top containers and didn't notice it was on my roof.  The handling felt the same and the mileage didn't drop so that I would notice.

I make routing trips to the Mojave desert in California with my father.  I love the air conditioning on those trips but we have to travel 7 miles on a desert road and on those times I wish that I had more ground clearance.  I tried putting on larger tires but that only had the effect of making my speedometer and odometer inaccurate.  I have replaced my tires with the original size.

My ideal car would be an Escort wagon with four more inches of ground clearance and a six speed transmission with a granny gear.  That was I could get the ground clearance of an SUV with the gas mileage of an economy car.

To answer some questions from Bob,  My wife and I both think that the wagon is very comfortable.  Our other cars have ranged from maxda rx7, suzuki samurai, dodge caravan, plymouth laser and nissan truck.  So by comparison the escort is very quiet and comfortable, almost as quiet as the caravan.  It does make noise when you rev the engine pretty high but I normally don't.  It is pretty smooth on the highway which is where I do most of my driving.  The brakes are average, nothing special except that my original brakes lasted over 150,000 miles since it is mostly freeway driving and I tend to slow down way before a stop sign and coast. Other than tires, we have replaced the timing belt and while it was off we had them replace the water pump which started making soft groaning sounds.  We changed the spark plugs once that I can remember.  I am 5'7'' and can sleep in the back without bending my legs.  I can carry 8 foot sections of 2x4s inside the car over the passenger seat and resting on the dashboard.  I only use the nissan pickup in places where I need more load carrying capacity than the escort with my 800 lb trailer.
