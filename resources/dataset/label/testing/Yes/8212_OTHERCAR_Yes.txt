            I bought my Hyundai Accent 1.5 GLSi back in 1998. It was secondhand with 11,000 miles on the clock. The things that attracted me to the car were the attractive styling, roomy boot (trunk), the fact that it was still fully covered under an unlimited mileage 3 year warranty, was economically priced and available on a finance purchase scheme.

The car has not let me down. I drive/work it hard and have added over 100,000 miles onto the clock in a little over two years.  It is stored outside throughout the year including the inclement British winter and always starts first time with no hesitation.

The car is fun to drive and is quite nippy considering the small engine. Having driven the automatic version in the USA, I would personally recommend a manual gearbox unless driving purely in busy traffic jammed cities.  The automatic version was far more sluggish and a little boring in comparison.

I have had no major problems and have the car serviced every 10,000 miles.
Minor faults are few but the rubber seal on the drivers door keeps working loose and then gets damaged when shutting the door. 
One small but worthy point to mention is the design of the wheel trims which actually bolt on with the wheel, unlike some cars where they clip on and have a tendency to fall off!

Overall I have found this car to be very reliable, great fun to drive, comfortable and an excellent workhorse.

The car is suitable for anyone young and old alike. I have used mine for business use as well as leisure use.  It would make an excellent small family car. I can thoroughly recommend it!<br><br>
