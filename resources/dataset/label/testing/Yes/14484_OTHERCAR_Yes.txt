            I am a 16 year old male.  The 1994 LeBaron is my first car.  My parents baught this car because it is very safe with dual air bags, and pretty heavy for a convertible.  I have had very few problems with the car.  The few problems I had were very minor.  First the reverse lights burnt out, and the lighter didnt work.  Besides those few minor problems nothing else has gone wrong.  I love teh convertible in the summer, but I hate how long it takes to warm up in the cold winter.  I feel someone who is buying their son or daughter a car should consider this.  If you are taller then 6'2&quot; or bigger then 250 this car would not be comfortable for you.  Also someone with more then 3 kids should not consider this car.  This car is very fast with a V6 engine.<br><br>
