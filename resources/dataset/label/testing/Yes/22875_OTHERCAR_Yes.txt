              Yep I got this 1993 Dodge Shadder about 1.5 years ago and it actually runs better than when I got it.  I consistently get 23-30 mpg in the city and 34-40 mpg on the highway do to some special tuning of mine.  It can get rather noisy inside the car simply because of the engine.  I have yet to have a ny knocking sounds except from the right front wheel.  This is because a balancing weight fell off about 8 months ago and neither myself nor 2 other mechanics have been able to find.   
  I paid 2k for the car and has been well worth it.  Its great for getting where you need to go unless it is snowing or raining outside.  Starts fine in the winter but the light weight and the distribution of this light weight is terrible(Though this can be fun when there is 7 inches of snow in the ground).  She is also bad about spinning her tires from a stop when it is raining.  And no this is not caused by the driver(I knew what you were thinking).  As with almost all Shadows,  there are electrical problems.  Nothing critical but just plain annoying when you dont need to be annoyed.  For instance,  the radio and speakers.  The wiring of the cars are very poorly engineered.  
  As you have experienced or read,  Shadows are subject to paint chipping.  There are ways to avoid this but you have to be good to your machine.  Mine has yet to have rust or paint chipping.  Something to do to avoid this if you have had no problems yet is to wax it 2 times per year as suggested and fast wax it 2 or 3 times per month.  Fast wax only stays on yer car for 3 days to a week but it helps.
  Also to keep you engine in good shape,  put some of that carb cleaner about every 2000-4000 miles.  Also look into using products such as 4 cylinder Engine Restore or 4 Cylinder Oil Treatment at every oil change if you really want to have a long life on that puppy.
  BOTTOM LINE:  If you need a cheap car that will put up with lots of cr@p while still taking you where you want to go and look like a bad a$$ in,  check out this pocket rocket.<br><br>
