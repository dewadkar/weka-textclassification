            Unfortunately after a car accident my husband and I were in the situation to purchase a new vehicle.  I always new that my next car purchase would be a Honda Accord since I fell in love with the new body style.  It took about a week to narrow it down to our final purchase after looking at several and their flexible prices we made our chose.  We decided on a 1999 Honda Accord EX, which meant for my husband a new toy ride and to me comfort for me and my toddler.  It has all the nice features, like cruise control, moonroof, CD player, power locks and windows (once you have had these its hard to go back to roll-em ups), and the key-less entry feature on the key-chain.  They key-less entry gadget allows you to unlock your doors and set your alarm from a distance and also allows you to pop your truck too.

I like the car because of its smooth ride and its sleek body that is more sporty than a regular sedan, like a camry which I had before and loved too.  The marvelous color we have is cranberry (which is kinda purple)and its a really nice color.  The only thing that I would change about this purchase is that it is a five speed, which shocked me too, because I didnt think that a car with so much to offer would be a standard.  My husband loved that even more and I dont have such a big problem with it since I can handle it just as well as him!! We got this machine at a wonderful price of 15,300.00 and we are sure we got a good deal and plan to keep this car for several years.<br><br>
