            As a fan of the Ford Explorer it pains me greatly to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. The Explorer is in general, a spectacular ride on and off road, is roomy and comfortable, but many models are riddled with problems and drawbacks.

My best recommendation is made to any car seeker.  Buy yourself a subscription to Consumer Reports before purchasing any vehicle new or used  - period. I have found their information incredibly reliable and unfortunately for me, true.

There are a few years on the list specifically recommended not to buy. The 1992 model is the lemon of the bunch and is reported to be riddled with every serious problem under the sun. 

Unfortunately, I have to agree. With 3 transmissions and other repairs too lengthy to note, all I can say is grab a copy of Consumer Reports and run with it. And next time, I will have my copy handy. <br><br>
