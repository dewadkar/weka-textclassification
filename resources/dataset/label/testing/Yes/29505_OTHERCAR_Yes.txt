            I bought the camera over 6 months ago and have taken over 1500 pictures.  It's a great little camera. My uncle has the Sony Mavica, and while it seems to have some good features, it's much bigger than the Kodak (I like the smaller form-factor.)  The downloading interface is easy, it has USB, and the picture quality, especially outdoors, is great.  I would suggest getting a viewfinder on whatever digital camera you buy - the Kodak 240 model has one.  The viewfinder is especially helpful when it is bright outside, and you can't see the little digital screen.  I am part of a Search and Rescue Team, and use the camera outdoors on my search and rescue practices.  I've dropped it several times, and am pretty rough with it.  So far, it has always worked well, even after the falls.

There only 2 downsides I can think of for the camera. One is that it really sucks down batteries, especially if you review pictures on the digital screen. (I'd suggest getting more than one set of rechargeable batteries as backups).  Also, sometimes when taking pictures indoors, the flash causes a blue glare on the pics, but this usually only happens when the room is pretty dark and the subject is more than about 5-6 feet away.

The following statement added after 9 months of use:

Camera still great, but was in the shop for over a month when it just stopped working. Acted like the batteries were dead, but even after replacing the batteries it remained frozen and would not work. My sister has a 280, and the same thing happened to hers. I would suggest purchasing an extended warranty if available.<br><br>
