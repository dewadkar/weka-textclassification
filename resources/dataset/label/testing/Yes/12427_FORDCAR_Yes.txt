            I bought a 91 Ford Taurus in April of 99 and it only had 61,000 miles.  I love it. It is roomy and dependable.  Sure it is not the best looking car on the road, but for a smooth low, cost ride, it is the best used car I have ever bought.  The only down side is that these are notorious for having bad transmissions that are costly to fix.  Mine went at 71,000 miles.  With that being fixed i have no other complaints about it. All of the extras (cruise, air, power doors &amp; locks etc. ) have never been a problem for me. I would recommend the older Taurus' to families looking for a good comfortable and affordable used vehicle.  The back seat is large enough for 2 car seats and a 3rd child to sit comfortably.<br><br>
