            In November I began to seek a new car. I wanted something affordable, dependable, with good speed, and handling ability. So far, overall the Focus has exceeded in all these areas. It was actually the first car I looked at, and decided to pass, thinking it would be just another Escort.
I continued to shop, and looked at several other models before my attention shifted back to Ford. I was on the internet site looking at the package options. Lets see a Japanese Z-Tech engine(4straight cylinders) although it moves like a v6. Remote keyless entry, with a built in alarm system. ABS brakes, a factory detachable face CD player. An AMAZING factory stereo w/ surround speakers. The car looks kind of small on the outside but has an amazing amount of room on the inside. Especially the trunk. Last week I fit 2 suitcases, a basket of dirty laundry, my sons electric four wheeler, and a deluxe size microwave. Still space left over.
The body is extremely unique, with lines and curves I havent seen on an automobile before it. From the back it looks similar to a Lex, and the handles are taken directly from a Mercades. The body is quite Euro, with the anttena running out the front center of the car. Ford has done extremely well in moving towards the next century...When you drive the focus you feel as if youve paid only a mere 13,000$ in order to buy the future in automobiles. A great buy, and highley recomended here for anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle.<br><br>
