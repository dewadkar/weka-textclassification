            I am the proud owner of the 4x4 ex cab mentioned in skydemon66's opinion.  Id like to expand on his views (basically all of it is true).  I�ve been drawn to toyota pickups largely because i don't like lallygagging around with downtime in the fixit shop.  in addition to reliable, they're efficient, stylish and easy to accessorize.

Living in maine, rust is the first thing that would kill the taco.  after 3 winters and 30k, the frame and engine have minimal corrosion.  paint is in mint condition except for some clear coat imperfections on the leading edge of the hood where a few fingernail-sized areas chipped from picking up pebbles. a bug visor will solve this problem.

The engine (2.7L 4 cyl- 150hp) is peppy and torquey down low and makes more noise than power at higher rpms.  but there is enough beef to get both wheels spinning in second on dry pavement.  the manual shifts smooth as long as you don�t rush it.  highway drives are fine with a more powerful aftermarket stereo since there is a bit of road noise but it�s a truck after all.  i was impressed to get 26mpg (regular unleaded) since the majority of usage is with a load of landscape material hauled around town.  even freighted, the truck still has enough juice to get in and out of traffic with minor planning ahead.  brakes are solid under all conditions.  i must honestly say that despite the size and weight of tacomas, mine does absolutely fine in slippery weather with good tires.  rarely do i need to use 4wheel drive.  if the back end does get away (cant say i don't do it on purpose once in a while) you can feel when it's about to go.  the longer wheelbase of the xtracab helps minimize fishtailing.  as far as reliability, it has run flawless ever since the purge solenoid harness was replaced (under warranty) causing the check engine light to show.  that's it!

I'm 6'2 and entry/exit is just fine as well as legroom.  the larger cab should be considered for taller drivers.  the front seats could benefit from more lumbar support and bolstering.  the back seats i've found to basically be a joke for passengers, but they do come with 3 point belts and are handy in a pinch.  there's plenty of room back there for a good sized sub-box for as much bass as one can survive.

If you are planning to use one of these for work and have a plastic bedliner, get rid of it immediately.  in the 2 weeks mine was in, i had about an inch of dirt and junk shoved up under there scraping things badly.  i quickly scheduled a rhino-lining.  the bed is low enough to work out of comfortably and the tailgate is light enough so if your mom needs to borrow it, she won't break her finger trying to work it.  the only thing i would do since i carry heavy things now and then is to add a leaf spring in the rear.  so far my tacoma has been a pleasure to own. when it�s time to replace it, i'd happily get another.


*update*
worthwhile upgrade- this fall i had another leaf put in both sides and it makes a nice difference in weight capacity.  i figure it adds about 500lb.  cornering is better with less body roll but the bumps are a tad more noticeable if the bed is empty.
