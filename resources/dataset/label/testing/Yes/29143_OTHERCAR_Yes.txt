            Our family bought a Volvo station wagon (im not exactly sure on the model) back in 1987.  It was your basic, royal blue, family automobile.  Back then it went for 25-30K, now I'm sure its much more expensive.  But if todays Volvos are anything like the one we got, I would recommend all of their cars.  The 87 wagon was safe and dependable, with very few engine or other problems and stayed strong through several fenderbenders.  Volvos are known as the safest models in the world and this is true.  Even now, in the year 2000, our aunt has taken control of our 87 Volvo and is still driving it around with no problems.  It has close to 200K miles on it and still runs great.  Thats what I call a car!<br><br>
