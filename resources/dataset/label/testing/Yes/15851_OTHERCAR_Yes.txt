            We decided on this vehicle primarily for its safety aspect - passengers higher than the plane of impact in an ordinary car.    

Also beneficial is its capability in comfortably seating 8.  We have 2 children and frequently travel to out of town sports events and love the space and comfort of our Suburban.     

Ours is a 2 wheel drive with a very smooth ride, but I must say the weight took some getting used to - have to put a firmer foot on the brake than I did on the Explorer we had previously. The only thing I dislike is that it is a little more difficult to park and maneuver in a parking lot, but that has been tolerable.       

I love the v-8 power and acceleration from the engine.  It has had to go into the shop for a few minor repairs, but nothing major.     

Would buy another one again, no question.  More bang for the buck than any other sport utility! My favorite thing about the Suburban is that other cars do not pull out in front of you...they wait!<br><br>
