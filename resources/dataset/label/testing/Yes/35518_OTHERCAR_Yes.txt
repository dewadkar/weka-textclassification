            We bought a Kodak 3900 Digital Camera for our daughter who was getting into photography.  For years we have dealt with 35mm cameras and film developing.  The internet, computers, and e-mail have made a digital camera a wise choice.  We began our search for the camera by price comparison.  We searched epinions, our local retailers, and sought advice from each.  When the decision came to buy the camera we based our choice on price, reputation, and the salesperson's advice.  

We made the purchase and our daughter couldn't be happier. We got the camera home and she went photo crazy.  We were amazed at the ability of the camera to take crystal clear images that could be "adjusted" and enhanced. Our daughter sent a number of pictures to friends and family on the internet and they were amazed at the quality. (so were we)

The Kodak 3900 Digital Camera has the following qualities:

<b>3.1 Megapixel Resolution:</b> This means your camera has the ability to create 11"x14" photo quality prints.  The more megapixels the camera has, the better the photo quality, however, more megapixels take up more memory.

<b>6X Zoom:</b> 2X optical zoom for moving in for close shots.  3X digital zoom for moving in after the shot is taken to create the pictures you desire.

<b>Built in Flash:</b>  The camera has a built-in automatic flash.  The pictures still come out very nice in low-light conditions.

<b>JPEG Standard Image Files:</b> The camera has the ability to capture JPEG standard image files for easy loading into the internet.

<b>Compact and lightweight:</b>  The camera is lightweight and compact.  It will fit in your purse or backpack for easy carrying and deployment.  The camera only weighs 7.9 ounces.

<b>8mb compact memory card:</b>  The camera comes with an 8mb compact memory card. We upgraded to a 32mb card and it is working just fine with that size card.  The standard 8mb card allows only a small number of pictures to be stored in the camera. Some memory cards are much bigger than 32mb but she found that card is best because it limits the number of photos you must search when going through your photographs. 

<b>Taking pictures:</b> The camera is as simple as point and shoot. My daughter and I like to view the pictures we are going to take through the view window.  This feature allows you to view the photo before you take it.  This saves space and allows for quality photos to be taken.  If you don't like the photograph you have taken you get a couple of seconds to delete it before it goes to the memory card.

Quality Photographs.  The quality is excellent.  The photographs are as clear as those taken with our regular 35mm camera.  They are crisp, detailed, and can be adjusted to your needs. 

Overall we (our daughter included) have been very impressed with this camera.  It was a valuable addition to our family.  I would rate it above a video camera because it is easier to use and more adaptable to sending others our photographs.
