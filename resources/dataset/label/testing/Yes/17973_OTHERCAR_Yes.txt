            I bought this Jeep on my birthday, December 14th and have already (in a week) put over 1000km on it. It is simply incredible. I have never owned a vehicle I have liked so much from the start. I feel confident and unpretentious driving it. 

My first trip it in was to Clearwater, BC (1.5 hours north of Kamloops, BC) I drove in total over 1000km in three days.  I drove threw hours of snow covered roads and I never would have done that in a million years.  I get nervous in the snow.  I felt better having the best 4x4 in the world.  No one would dispute that.

I averaged 27-9mpg (cnd gallons are 1/5th larger) and so I cannot complain about that.  I like that it is a truck and way more comfortable than the last CJ7 I drove.  It is a truck though and not a prissy SUV so other reviewers here keep referring to there comfy cars... It is a truck.  Does anyone remember what that used to mean?  How many people are gonna take there 40,000 suv 4wdriving? 5%.  Well I would not hesitate to take mine out.  Every dent ends up being a story.  Imagine that kind of freedom in a vehicle.

I ilke almost everything about it.  If you can't stand the noise leave the hardtop on you winers.  My other car is a Mazda RX7 convertible.  The TJ has plenty of room...  :-)

It is what it is and there is not much out in the market to compare it to.  Apples to Apples.

Oh and by the way..  for those of you who drive fast don't buy it.  It will fall over. It is designed that way.. It is called Center of gravity. Sheesh, everyone wants a guarantee these days....

Life Life, buy a Jeep.
