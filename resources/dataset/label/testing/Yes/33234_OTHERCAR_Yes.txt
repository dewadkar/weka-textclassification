            I purchased this vehicle because of it's reputation and good quality.  I have owed three Hondas already and enjoy the comfort of knowing my car will not break down.  I love this car because it is dependable and economical.  I also love the car because it handles great and allows me to get out of binds quickly.  The maneuverability is incredible.  I think that this car should be purchase by anyone looking to have an automobile for a long time--someone who cares about their car and intends to drive it until the owner dies (the car will not).  A friend of mine had a 1990 Honda Accord and sold it in 1997 for $10,000 in good condition.  I don't think that this car should be purchased by people who do not intend on keeping the car for long.<br><br>
