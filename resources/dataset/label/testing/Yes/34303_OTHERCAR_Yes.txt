            My parents bought this car new in 93 in the Virgin Islands.  Being on a small island, the mileage stayed low until they moved back up to the states.  It currently has almost 100000 miles on it.  The car was mainly used to tow a 19' boat, and to get to beaches that a regular car would not have been able to reach.  For these uses, it was the perfect car for the job.  I've taken it up fairly steep, rut covered hills, and pulled boats out of the water on slippery docks.  The 4 wheel drive is essential for these activities.  
The car is expensive to repair.  After getting into a rear end collision with it, it cost me almost $2000 to get it back on the road, with fairly minor front end damage.  The lack of an airbag also makes it somewhat unsafe in an accident.  
I've had the air conditioning go out and had to replace the compressor.  The transmission has needed some work.  Right now, I'm having problems with the heater.  It won't stay hot when the car is not moving.  


<b>The Good</b>

Good towing capability.
4 wheel drive makes offroading easy and fun.
Plenty of room in the back for moving.


<b>The Bad</b>

Noisy
Bumpy
Expensive to repair.
Low gas mileage.
