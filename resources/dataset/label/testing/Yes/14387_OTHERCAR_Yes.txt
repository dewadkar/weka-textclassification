            As a first time buyer of a digital camera, I did not know anything about digital cameras.  When I was looking for a digital camera, my brother suggested to buy a camera with pixels between 2 and 3 mega pixels.  It seems that cameras with 1.3 mega-pixels are the standard for the most of digital cameras in the market.  However, the quality of a picture taken by a 1.3 mega-pixel camera seems slightly less than a normal picture taken by a non-digital camera.  

So how good is 2.1 mega-pixels?  The real quality of pixels can be tested when a picture is enlarged.  I was just amazed to see how much a 2.1 mega-pixel digital picture can be enlarged without losing its clearness.  You need to try it.  

The camera also comes with a 8 MB memory card and 2.5x digital zoom.  An average picture takes about 0.75 MB.  But if the memory card is full, pictures can be transferred into a computer by just connecting the camera by a USB cable.  (the use of USB port made it very easy to transfer the data from a camera to the computer.)  If 8 MB is not enough, memory cards can be purchased which range from 8 to 64 MB.  The price of those memory cards also ranges from $80 to $300 based on the memory capacity. 

As is the case for other digital cameras, the data can be easily sent by e-mail to a friend or can be printed by a high level color picture printer.  The quality of the picture printed by those high quality printers is not different (or better) from a picture taken by a non-digital camera.  Also, if a picture did not turn out as you intended, the picture can be erased immediately without getting printed.

A bad thing about this camera was about its complexity of the software installation which took me over one hour.  Additionally, the camera does not come with a lens cover or a case, so the picture display and the lens are not fully protected.  

Considering its price (less than $300), Finepix 2300 offers the best value for a digital camera with over 2 mega pixels.
