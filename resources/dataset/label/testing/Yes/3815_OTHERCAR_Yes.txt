            The time had come for my wife and I to trade in our aging, old car and look for a new one.  We had both decided we wanted a small SUV with all wheel drive for our harsh northern winters, but on the other hand, didn't want a huge, gas guzzling beast that would break our budget.  We researched many different vehicles and we came down to 2 finalists - the Honda CRV and the Toyota RAV4.  
After looking at both vehicles at dealerships, our decision became clear.  To get a RAV4 with the same features as a CRV, we would end up, on average, paying between $3000 to $4000 more.  In addition, our local Toyota dealer didn't seem to eager to make a good deal with us.  Honda was the winner.

Styling and Power:
Both my wife and I agreed that the CRV's styling is a little on the bland side.  While it is a huge improvement over the last generation CRV, it still isn't what I consider a "head turner".  That's ok by us, though, as almost everything else about the vehicle makes up for this.  

The new 2.4 litre iVTEC four cylinder is your typical Honda four cylinder.  It's buttery smooth, makes good horsepower for it's size - 160 - and, I'm sure, will be ultra reliable.  In this application, however, a tall, somewhat heavy SUV, it does feel a little taxed.  Our CRV has the automatic transmission, but I've heard that even with the 5 speed manual, power is a bit on the short side.  If Honda installed it's wonderful V6 in the CRV, it would make the vehicle probably 99.9% perfect.  Gas mileage has been very good, which is a big plus for us.  Even though our CRV has only about 1000 miles on it, we're averaging 26mpg combined hwy/city.  I can only expect this to improve as the engine breaks in more, which makes me very happy.

Comfort and Features:
Inside the CRV is very comfortable.  Both driver and passenger seats provide good support and lots of leg and headroom even with our EX's standard sunroof.  Rear seat room is good for two, but three adults would be a bit tight.  One nice feature is that the split rear seat not only folds flat, but the seat backs recline for rear passenger comfort.  
The EX model, which we purchased, comes standard with just about every option you could want.  Power windows, locks, mirrors, sunroof, A/C, 6 disk in-dash CD changer, alloy wheels, etc.  There's even a picnic table folded flat in a compartment in the rear cargo area.  Needless to say, there wasn't any option we needed to purchase.  

Ride/Handling:
For a small wheelbase, tall SUV, the CRV rides and handles pretty well.  It does have a bit of a choppy ride on our awful Ohio highways, but it is nothing extreme.  Handling is also good and the CRV does not give you that "tippy" feeling when going around corners as some SUV's do.  Braking is also good, but pedal feel is a little soft, unlike other Honda products I have owned in the past.  Stopping is still good and short though thanks to four wheel disk brakes with ABS.

Safety:
The CRV comes standard with many safety features.  It has dual front AND side airbags, and anti-lock brakes.  It also comes with a theft deterrent system with a special chip built into each key that makes will not allow the vehicle to start unless that key is used.  The only drawback to this is that you can only get duplicates made at your local Honda dealer.  

Summary:
In all, the CRV has exceeded our expectations for a small SUV.  No, it won't take you every place off road a Jeep Wrangler will, but that isn't a consideration for us.  The CRV is value packed, provides good comfort for two or four, very good fuel economy for an SUV, and exceptional Honda quality and reliability.  I can definetly recommend the CRV highly to anyone who needs or wants a small SUV but doesn't want to be saddled with a hulking, gas guzzling beast.
