               The 1500 silverado is about the best buy for the money when you compare
it to the other usa full size trucks.I have the 4.8 V8 ,air, cruise, auto trans, shortbed ,regcab.It is everything I could ask for with out all the other frills.It rides like as dream, and has more then enough power for hauling my boat.I'm very impressed with paint job on this truck no orange peel.The standard am fm cass also kicks butt.The large 26 gal gas tank is also nice.Until you have to pay for a fill up.
Only regret I have is,that I should got the cd player.
