            First off, I am not a car person. I can't tell you all the specifications for this car, and I can't recommend it from a professional standpoint. But I can tell you that this is what I drive and it is the best car on earth. I have a 1985 Toyota Corolla, and I love it. It has never once broken down, it gets good mileage, and it's tough. All those little fender benders add up, but there is not a mark on my car. 
This is a phenomenal car for people like me who work minimum wage and need something cheap, solid and dependable. Not only does the perfect track record keep repair costs down, but it keeps insurance down. And it never fails to take me where I want to go.
Functionality aside, this car is a pleasure to drive. I drive stick, and I have never felt a transmission I like as much as the Corolla. It is easy and smooth, unlike many Hondas, Nissans, and other such cars I have driven. The one problem with the Corolla is that it doesn't have a lot of get-up-and-go, but that is not a huge problem for me. The acceleration is slow but once you get going there is no problem. 
I think I can safely recommend this car to anyone, but especially if you are looking for something on the cheap side. And the dependability is number one for me. Toyota's have just about the best repair record of any cars, and my 15 years without a breakdown are testimony to that. <br><br>
