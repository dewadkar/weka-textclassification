            Needless to say, my collection of digital cameras has grown yet again.  I was at a Circuit City and came across a FD-95 as an "open box" item.  Turns out someone bought it, thought it was too big, and brought it back after losing the battery and scratching the case (big no no).  I got the thing for $199.00, less than half of what even the cheapest online sellers are getting for it, so I'm happy.  The scoop follows:

<b>MISC. INFO</b>

I cannot comment on everything you get in the box, since this was an open box item that was sold to me.  You "should" get a lens cap, battery, charger/power cable, and floppy disk.

The FD-95 when it first hit the market was considered a big gun in the digital camera world, giving you the ability to manually control focus, shutter speed, F-stops, and more, as well as being able to use it in "auto" setting.  This was not common at that time, so the originally selling price was $1,000 or more.

The FD-95 is capable (like many floppy style Mavicas) of taking several (but not many) images on a floppy disk.  No special drivers, cables, or card readers are needed to view the photos on a computer like with many other digital cameras.  On the down side, images must be heavily "compressed" so they fit on a tiny storage capacity floppy disk.  On the up side, you can take a photo, pop out the disk, and view it on any computer within seconds.  Ease-of-use is the calling card of Sony's Mavica line of cameras.

Besides taking still images, you can take up to 60 seconds of video at low resolution, or 15 seconds at a higher resolution.  Nothing to write home about in terms of quality, and it won't replace your camcorder, but good enough for email.

You have varied effects such as a black and white mode, text mode for shots of text (duh), as well as sepia (antique photo effect) and solarize.  Sound can be added to each photo for quick notes.  

<b>GOOD STUFF</b>

The FD-95 features a 10X optical zoom, with image stabilization.  Even today, it's hard if not rare to find any digital camera with this much zoom.  To my knowledge, only Olympus carries 2 models that match this, and Fuji a couple that come close with 6X zooms.  A 2X digital zoom stretches the 95's zoom to 20X - and while digital zooms do decrease an images quality overall, Sony's digital zooms do a better than average job of it so this digital zoom is actually usable.  

The lens barrel is threaded to accept off-the-shelf 52mm sized camera filters.  I consider this rare trait a great thing, as you can always leave a UV filter on, adding a layer of protection to your main lens.  You can also buy varied filters for effects as well.  Not commonly found on other brands of cameras, so a plus.

<b>THE BOO BOOS</b>

Floppy disks are small.  They cannot hold a lot of data.  As a result, the FD-95 must greatly "compress" or "shrink" the image data on the photos you take in order to fit just 4 of them per floppy disk, at the camera's best resoltion setting of 1600 x 1200 pixels (2 megapixels).  An Olympus camera of the same resolution for instance, uses a memory card with more room for storage, so it's best photo may be 2 megs in size.  A floppy can only hold 1.4 megs.  The Sony must compress the images to squeeze them on, so image quality even at the best setting does not compare to other brands.

You can purchase a floppy disk adapter and a "memory stick" for this camera, and via the memory stick, take dozens of photos instead of relying on floppy disks, but the camera does not alter the amount of compression even if you do use a stick, so images are still heavily compressed.  The lower resolution settings of 640 and 1024 pixels to me, produce unacceptable quality.  Only the top 1600 pixel setting can crank out adequate shots for email, web sites, and prints up to 5 x 7.

The camera is large.  I can see men liking it for it feels solid in your hand, but I think women would find it too bulky and heavy to carry around.

<b>FINALS</b>

If you can find the FD-95 on clearance, ebay, or as an open box item, and can find it for let's say, $425 or less, then go for it.  At top resolution, it takes "acceptable" photos, and offers you a great zoom and set of features for that price.  

If not, then spend a few dollar more and for $499 at CompUSA or online, you can buy the Olympus 2100uz, which also has a 10X image stabilized zoom, the same features as the FD-95 (and more), is a bit smaller, and takes higher quality photos.

Happy photo snapping.
