            When I got this digital camera, I thought it would take me an hour just to figure out how
to turn it on. When it took it out of the box, I turned it on and in no time I was using it
like i had used it for 20 years. I was happy to know that it was easy to send pictures over
an email online, and soon I was using my digital camera to send pictures to my family and
friends. it took no time to explain how to use it, and everyone in my family could also use
my digital camera. I not once had to fiddle around with it to find out how to do this, or how
to move that.  It was a little expensive by my terms, but it sure was worth it. No more
waiting for your pictures to develop! Just pop in your 3 1/2 floppy disk in the a: drive in
your pc, open your diskette, and look at your beautiful pictures! The most you would need
to know to send the pictures as an email is to click �edit attatchments� or any other form
of that, hit browse, find your picture in �3 1/2 floppy disk,� click on attatch, repeat what I
told you to attatch more than one picture, and then click �done� when your done. You can
put in a little note that you have attatched pictures, so that you friends and family don�t
miss it, and then send it to anyone you want to! I would recommend getting the
MVC-FD73 digital camera instead of the other models because it is the one that has the
Quick Access FD drive, with 10X Zoom, and an email mode for faster downloads than any
other digital camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone, even a 60-year-old
because it is so easy to use!!<br><br>
