            I bought this product because I wanted to have a digital camera and that my dad can photograph his projects and also to me to have fun. I since have used this product for about 1 month, I have used it for everything from taking photographs in the mountain, in caves, on the beach, and at home. I have liked this product so much and also my grandfather that he has all the time asked me to lend him the camera so he can take photographs, he has used most of the time. I have also used this product to e-mail photographs to my cousin. I love this product because it is light, easy to take photos, and it is not expensive to buy the 3.5&quot; disks since they cost me like $20 bucks 100 disks it is not like buying that expensive film for the common cameras that cost like $10 bucks each film roll and only take like 24 or 12 or 36 photos and they don't come out well sometimes, and with this digital camera you can take like 40 photos in a single disk and you can see what is coming out and you can delete any unwanted photos. I also like its zoom. The camera is so easy to use, I don't hate any feature about the camera.
The people who should buy this camera are people that want to see what they want to come out on the photos and people who want great quality on the photos.<br><br>
