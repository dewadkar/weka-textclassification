            I test drove several SUV's before choosing the Honda CRV. It happened to be raining when I took this vehicle out for the test drive. I actually felt the all time - all wheel drive do it's 'thing' when I hit a huge puddle at a decent speed. It felt like it instantly 'grabbed' the road. I felt totally safe and in total control. I also must say this vehicle handles like a car, not like a truck at all.
  I've driven from Pennsylvania to South Carolina in this vehicle and didn't have a sore butt or back when I arrived. The one bad thing my husband complained about was the lack of an armrest on the passenger side. Now, for my favorite feature...the pop out folded up picnic table in the back hiding under the carpet. We used it several times when we stopped at rest areas and fast food places...so convenient...too bad drive in theatres don't exist anymore! 
  I love my Honda CRV so much that I'm planning on buying the 2000 model.
I highly recommend this vehicle.<br><br>
