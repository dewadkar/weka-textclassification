            <b>Initial Impression</b>

It has been nearly two years since I purchased my dark green Infinity. The initial reasons for my purchase were probably based more on <i>status</i> than on some of the more sound factors. After comparing several cars with similar features, including a Nissan Maxima, an Infinity Q45, and a Lexus ES 300, I finally settled on the 1994 Dark Green J30 -- I've <b>never</b> looked back since.

<b>Body and Style</b>

The general template of the car is that of the late nineties Ford Taurus. It is similarly rounded at the back, however thankfully lacks the <i>bloated</i> aspect that plagues the Taurus. Some versions come with a rear spoiler, but it almost looks like an afterthought, and I decided to skip on that little option. It isn't a <i>spoiler</i> type of car anyway -- it has the class of a Jaguar, with Italian designs and Japanese engineering. The car is not as large as some of the high level luxury sedans -- a feature most people delight in. 

<b>Interior</b>

The cabin is absolutely gorgeous. It is everything one desires from a luxury sedan and more. The design is Italian based, thus doesn't have the <i>flat</i> feel of a Jaguar or a BMW. There are curves all around you. Whether you are sitting as a driver, passenger, or in the rear, everything around you flows into everything else. 

More comfort cannot be imagined in a car. The analog clock in the center of the dash has gold accents, and immediately set the ambiance of the car ... spectacular feel. 

The BOSE audio system is nothing to laugh at, and will probably blow out your ear-drums if given full volume ( foolishness I have yet to attempt ). The ventilation and air conditioning is simple to use and works wonderfully. In fact, all of the features and buttons in the car are appropriately set, un-cluttered, and very simple to use. The cup holders and cigarette lighter bin is quietly hidden, and can be revealed with a tap of a panel or a button. 

The interior comes with all the luxury amenities, including an in-dash CD player, sunroof, and a car phone. 

<b>The Drive</b>

Driving this thing gives you a feel that you're no longer in a luxury sedan as it impresses you with its handling capabilities. The transmission is never felt in a shift. The turning is razor sharp, and the road bumps are barely there. The engine can only be heard during long and hard accelerations, but otherwise it is very quiet.

<b>Reliability and Mechanics</b>

Literally, aside from changing of oil every 3,000 miles, and the changing of rear brake pads right after buying the car just to be on the safe side, the car did not have one problem during the entire time I owned it. This is a <i>fabulous</i> buy.

<b>Overall</b>

This is the best car I've ever driven. I've had a BMW, and I've driven a Lexus and a Jaguar. I <b>bought</b> an Infinity J30!
