            I bought a 1993 Probe GT band new. My previous car was a 1989 Probe GT. My 89 Probe had a custom sports suspension and high-end performance tires. The stock 1993 Probe GT could run circles around my custom 89 Probe GT. My 1993 Probe GT was loaded (except leather and automatic transmission). 

I love driving hard through the turns and the 1993 Probe was a great handling car for the money. In 1993 you had to spend $20,000 more to find a car that could out handle the Probe. The Mitsubishi Eclipse and Acura Integra came close, but the Probe was the best and had the most room. Saying you have more room than an Eclipse or Integra Coupe is not much to brag about. It is like going from small to semi-small. The back seat was not for adults. You would hit your head on the roof and legroom was slim. My 6'4 friend road in the front passenger seat and his knees pressed against the dash. So if you are tall or have tall friends, you won't want this car. If you are 6ft or under, this is a great car.

The seats are a firm, but I drove many hours before I would want to get out and give my buns a break. Wind noise was average for sports cars. The interior layout was very well done. All of the controls had easy to use knobs and switches.

Driving the Probe GT was a blast. The only complaint I have is that 3rd gear was kind of a long throw. I could go from 1st to 2nd quickly. 4th and 5th gear were easy to use as well. It was just 3rd gear seem to be a like a semi-long throw from 2nd gear. Braking was great. I had four-wheel disk brakes with ABS. The feedback from the steering wheel was just fine. 

Besides the normal tune-ups and wear I only had two problems. The exhaust pipe was not welded correctly and was covered under warranty. The silver paint was fading to white. This was a common problem with silver cars. The Ford dealer told me that they had improved on Silver paints so I wouldn't have any problems. I can't believe I listened to a salesman. 

I really used and abuse my Probe. The backseats drop to make a large cargo bay. I carried a 4ft ladder with all sorts of tools and boxes in the back of my Probe. 

I am a lead foot and the Probe took the abuse.

Safety was good too. I can say that from experience. My Probe went off an 8ft high cliff at 35 mile an hour. The driverï¿½s air bag did its job. Both my friend and I walked away from the wreck. That was the end of my Probe. I know this will be a collectable car in the future. Its bodylines are classic and it is a good package.
