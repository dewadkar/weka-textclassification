            The Elantra's quality, fit and finish do not come close to that of a Honda, but the power train is much more refined as is the four speed automatic.

The interior cloth is just tacky, and the plastic scratches easily. The cruise control levers are on the windshield wiper control stick, which can make for some unintentional windshield washing while driving. Seats offer sufficient lateral support, but lumbar support could be improved. The optional stereo sounds GREAT, unlike most `economy' cars.

The engine in this car is it second biggest advantage after the price. The 4-cyl is actually powerful enough to team with a four speed automatic, unlike a Honda's four. The transmission shifts smooth and a just the right point, good job Hyundai!

Overall, exterior appearance is appealing, thought a redesign is due in the 2001 model year.
