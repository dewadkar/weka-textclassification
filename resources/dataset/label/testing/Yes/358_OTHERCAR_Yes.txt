            We bought our Xterra in Jan of 2000 and have been very pleased.  Our vehicle is identical to the one pictured and has all the available options.

We bought this vehicle because:
1. The rear seats are higher above the ground which makes it easier to get our kids in and out of the car when compared our smaller and lower to the ground Saturn.
2. The appearance/image of the car met with our approval.  I just can't see myself in a station wagon or van.
3. The price was right when compared to other SUv's

Exterior:8
I think the car has a really nice look.

Interior:8
All of the important features are there and I find the car comfortable to ride in and roomy.

Ride:6
Feels like a cross between a car and truck.  Somewhere in between!

Performance:6
Acceleration is alright but I would prefer a little more get up and go for passing.

Handling:8
Turns sharper than my small car.

Reliability:9
We have had no problems.

Value:8
If you want an SUV that you can be proud of but won't break the bank this one is hard to beat.

Overall recommendation:8
If you want a vehicle that is comfortable to drive, reasonably priced and does not make you feel stodgy this is the one.
