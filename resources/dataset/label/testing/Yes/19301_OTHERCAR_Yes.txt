            I picked this baby up for around $224 after researching pricescan.com and cnet's shopper.com.  It's an excellent low end starter camera.  i wouldn't suggest anything less.  I was going to get one of those $100 range 640x480 cameras but after seeing how blocky and ugly the pictures were i wouldn't dare put my money into that.

The colors are a bit off, even with the white balance settings.  So make sure you have a copy of photo editing software on hand to tweak the colors to your liking.  in general the pics are pretty nice.  The only problem is the grain on the pics that you sometimes notice.  You can see examples here:

it only comes with a 4MB card but... it holds 60 pics at 640x480 at a wonderful quality!

It was a toss up between an Olympus D-360L, D-460Z and an HP cam.  All within $50 of each other.
The HPs were very dark and high contrast.  So that was a definite no.
Olympus has always been good with quality, but on these newer cams, the jpeg compression around smaller objects causes them to blur a bit.  And there seemed to be green lines where a dark brown or black went into white on the D-460Z.
and on the 360L blue lines around objects against bright backgrounds.

So the fuji it was.  It even had the nice slim Olympus look.  The camera is pretty well protected from damage and dropping it.  (I should know)

With my research I found no other cam to be that good of a value in the $200 range.  Plus it comes with a zoom!<br><br>
