            From one of the top digital camera makers comes the 2.11 MP, 1600 x 1200 pixels maximum resolution Fuji Finepix A200, a versatile camera, loaded with features that will leave any casual users impressed.  In fact, this camera has what it takes to please anybody from a teenager on vacation on the islands or Hawaii to a gardener wanting to take a few shots of her roses to e-mail to her family members living in other parts of the world. 

Before going any further, right off the bat, I will say that it's a great present idea for any kids in the family.  With the popularity of digital cameras, more children will make use of them this shopping season.  When you take a look at this camera, you will see why Fuji company is so proud of this product.  They have designed it to be a small and light camera that users can just slip in their shirt or jacket pockets before going out of the house.  It weighs a mere 4.7 ounces.  For that matter, consider the <a href="/content_81208315524">4-MP Olympus Camedia C-400 zoom</a> which weighs 1 pound.  The Fuji Finepix A200 Digital Camera comes with a fixed focus Fujinon lens whose value is similar to the 36mm on a 35mm camera.  It has a 1.5-inch LCD screen, a built-in flash with redeye reduction and adjustable shutter speeds of 1/2-1/1000th of a second.  

<b>Ah, the many uses of this camera by a young user!</b>

For her birthday, our daughter received a Fuji Finepix A200 digital camera from her doting uncle.  She could not be happier to take it to her class to show her friends and peers on the cheerleading squad.  On our recent cross-country trip, she took pictures of all the places we went to.  She ended creating a nice portfolio to show her teachers and classmates.  I will say that the pictures were very clear and crisp.  To impress us, she recorded a 30-second of AVI video.  It was without sound of course.  Keep in mind that this camera can store up to 94 seconds of video on the 16MB xD-Picture Card.  Knowing that it can store up to 12.9 minutes on the larger 128 MB xD-Picture Card, we just wished we had bought her the latter.  She would have created more mini videos of the trip.    

<b>Why should you be attracted to this camera among many other models?</b>

As mentioned above, the Fuji FinePic A200 has some interesting features such as the Video Recording and PC-Cam Internet mode.  In addition, it's relatively easy to set the camera either automatic or manual.  Having done so, you will have greater control over each exposure.  The manual mode has six positions which you can select:  (Fine, Shade, Daylight Fluorescent, Warm White Fluorescent, Cool White Fluorescent, Incandescent Light) 
One thing I have found out was that if you overreach, you'll experience a degrading quality of the shots when it comes to the zoom.  


<b>Final Recommendations</b>

This is a decent camera for a beginner.  It's always great to have it around.  Thanks to its convenience, small size and weight, you can practically take it anywhere you want to.  Just go ahead and slip it into your purse or jacket pocket now!
