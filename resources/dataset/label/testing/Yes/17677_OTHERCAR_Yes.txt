            I owned a 1996 Saturn SL2 until March of 2001, when I decided it was time for a change. I was driving 35 miles one way to work in heavy stop-and-go traffic...in a MANUAL transmission car. DEFINITELY time for a change. I investigated a few other vehicles before deciding to go with a Saturn again (the others were the Toyota Camry and the Olds Alero).

Price was really a deciding factor for me; I wanted to keep my payments around a certain amount, and the dealership was happy to work with me...although they kept me there for EIGHT hours processing everything. THAT I was not happy about.

Already being familiar with Saturns and their reputation for safety, and already knowing I was comfortable IN the car, I decided to go with an automatic transmission. I found that, for the price I wanted to pay, I got MUCH more car than I had the first time.

The current Saturn: 2000 SL2, sunroof, rear spoiler, front end cover, cassette/CD player with premium sound system, dual airbags, leather interior, automatic transmission, air conditioning, and that nice "new car" smell that comes from having leather seats. HEAVEN.

After a year of ownership ("leasership"?), I am still as happy with it as when I first got it. I don't drive in anywhere near as much traffic anymore, so I don't spend as much time in it as I used to, but I still love driving it.

Things I especially like about the car:
� Automatic Transmission!!! 
� The light that comes on to say "Change Oil Soon". 
� The light that comes on to let you know it's time to fill the tank. 
� The sound system: CD/Cassette with equalizer; although I don't use them as often as I used to or would like to, the sound is still fantastic for a car of this calibre and price. 
� The sunroof: I live in California. 'Nuff said. 
� The trunk: plenty of room and the back seats fold down JUST in case you need MORE. 
� The gas mileage. Even though gas prices seem to be dropping, it's still nice to be able to fill up for less than $20. 
� The angle of the windshield: on those rare occasions when it rains in California, it's nice to know that you'll have very little glare from oncoming headlights on the raindrops.

Things I would like to see improved:
� The get-up-and-go: this is only a 4-cylinder car, but...I'd like a liiittle more "oomph" when I hit the accelerator. 
� The layout of the stereo and climate controls: for someone with long arms and a good memory, the current setup is not a problem. For someone shorter of both arms and memory, the layout is troublesome and not very intuitive. I suppose it's all a matter of what's more important to you, the climate or the radio. There are really too many stereo controls to comfortably operate while driving; a remote-controlled system or one that has controls on the steering wheel would be nice. The climate controls are alllll the way at the bottom (any lower and they'd be UNDER the center console!). 
� The noise level: but of course, this is NOT a "luxury" vehicle by any means. Still, I'd like to NOT have to turn the radio up so loud when I'm on the freeway. 
� Interior color scheme: the steering wheel & the dashboard not only do not match each other in color, but also do not match the color of the leather interior. Perhaps a minor point, but I'm a "my colors must match" sort of person. 
� ABS (anti-lock braking system) is not standard, it's an option.

Insurance is very reasonable on this car, depending on the insurance company (and your driving record, of course, among other factors); I believe most companies consider it a "compact" car.
