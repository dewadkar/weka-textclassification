            Tina's Dodge Stealth was a great car. I wish that it was mine!! It has a great looking body.  Even though it is  a few years old now.  It is a five speed.   It has automatic doors and windows.  

It has a look of its own.  For example Camaros and Firebirds look kind of alike.  A Toyota Camry and a Nissan Altima look kind of alike.  There is Nothing that looks like this car.  Except for maybe  a Dodge Viper.  There aren't many Vipers made so probably no one in your town has seen one.

This car drives like a dream.  When you are ready to take off,  You had better hold on!! The Stealth is ready before you are.  It is purring ready to go.  It holds to the road.  It is easy to shift the gears on this car. This Dodge Stealth is blue.  The inside is gray.  It has bucket seats in the front and a console in the middle.  There is a little back seat.  That is a con.  The car is unconfortable in the back seat.  As long as you are in the front you are fine. 

Tina bought this car brand new.  She has never done anything to it except put gas in it and change the oil.  This is a nice car.  If you take care of it, it will take care of you.  I would reccommend this car to anyone.  I have never seen it give her any trouble.  She still has it and it is now 7 years old.

Leave me comments about what you think about my review!!

Thank you for reading and have a good day!!
