            What can I say about my 2000 Grand Prix other than I love it.  I have an SE model for which I pay about $250 a month for a 15,000 mile/year lease.  The 3.1 liter engine is just enough to roast the tires every once in a while, but not too much so that I invite Mr. Policeman to chase me down.  I think it is the perfect combination of power and elegance in a relatively low cost, American sports car.  It provides more than enough room for 4 very comfortably.  I test drove the GTP and for those who would not be as troubled by the insurance payments I would strongly recommend the upgrade to the GTP.  For those like me who can't, the SE is more than enough to satisfy your hunger.  This is my second Grand Prix and after test driving and pricing out a Mercury Cougar, a Pontiac Firebird Formula, a Chevy Camaro, and a GMC Jimmy, for the value and the performance for your dollar I would recommend the Grand Prix hands down!<br><br>
