             About 2 years ago I bought a 92' Ford Escort. It has Standard transmission and is the best car I have ever owned. It has about 50,000 miles on it and I ususally have to fill it with gas ever 2 weeks for very low cost. However my car is getting old, so I decided that maybe I should look at &quot;upgrading&quot; to a newer Escort. I have looked around, but nothing can compare to the Escort's of the early 90's. I was shocked to hear that Ford discontinued the most practical car around. The Escort is not the car of the new millenium, the Ford Focus is. Now what is that? The Ford Focus is a European based car, suited for European people. Not that there is anything wrong with European people, but our taste in cars are very different. Europe is a place where unique and classy cars succeed. Car companies such as Volkswagen and Audi have found success in America. Ford on the other hand is American and should stick with America. I feel that by discontinuing the Escort, Ford is killing one of the few things that Americans can still call their own.
    A wise man once said, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it!&quot; Ford should takes these words in to mind when the Ford Focus crashes and burns in America!
