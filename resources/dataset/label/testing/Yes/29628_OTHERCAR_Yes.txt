            Despite my reservations about purchasing a mini-van, I relented to my better half's wishes. Thirty miles into our first road trip I wondered what took us so long get one. The comfort factor with 2 children is astounding. It is so nice to be able to see everything ahead without having to bounce from lane to lane. The only problem I have with this vehicle is the cruise control. When climbing hills it makes the engine jump for power as opposed to easing into it. I can live with that. The Quest's instrument panel is very driver friendly. Everything is within arms reach. Even my wife, who normally picks at everything, has found nothing bad to say about our Quest.<br><br>
