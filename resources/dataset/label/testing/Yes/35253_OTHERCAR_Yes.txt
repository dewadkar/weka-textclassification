            Across the bottom of my TV screen flashes a banner, " flash flood warning for Chester County, Pa".  Yet my daughter insists that she needs to go out shopping with her 93 Honda del sol.  Fifteen minutes after she left, I receive a phone call from a frantic woman on a cell phone telling me that my daughter's car is floating under a bridge.  My daughter is OK, but the car is ruined.  This is why I recently purchased a new Chevrolet Cavalier Sport Coupe, automatic, AC (standard), 4 wheel ABS (standard), with the upgraded stereo with CD and amplified speakers (a must for a college senior).
Anyway, the Chevrolet Cavalier often gets a bum rap from a lot of individuals here on Epinions, but after looking around and using what ever resources I had to purchase a car with, this is a real bargain  As mentioned, AC standard, 4 wheel ABS standard, a good start.  Three year, 36, 000 bumper to bumper warranty, hey! A-OK!  Fortunately for me I have a certificate for $1000 from GM because I once owned a 1987 Chevrolet pickup with the exploding gas tanks.  GM was also offering a $2500 cash incentive on the Cavalier, ching-ching, ching-ching!  Finally, $700 cash back earnings on my GM Mastercard plus a sweet $800 discount from the Chevrolet dealer.  Needless to say, I quit looking for a used Honda.
Now perhaps the car is a bit noisier than most, yep the dash may have a bit more plastic then I would like, but the 2.2 liter four runs pretty well, the traction assist 4 speed automatic transmission has received very good reviews, the car looks great and is sporty, is reasonably comfortable,  and it is an extremely good value. With all this said and done purchasing this 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier was a no brainer! Now if GM would only make the Cavalier with an optional out board motor.
