            I've owned the DC215 since last December and have used it extensively since!  This investment has paid for itself in photo development costs easily within just the first year.

I originally bought the DC215 right before my wife and I left for a short trip to London.  Fortunately, the camera arrived the day before we left (I was sweating this one, it was one of the main reasons I purchased it) and I had ample time to fiddle with the camera on the 7-hour plane ride.

This camera is a snap to use - if you know how to use a traditional 35mm point and shoot and have a very basic level of computer knowledge, the features of the DC215 should be easily understandable to you.

Picture quality is very crisp and color reproduction is AMAZING - this is something I had read frequently about the Kodak digital cameras, and it is definitely true.  The DC215 is a one megapixel camera, and will produce excellent 4x5 prints.  If you want to push it, you can get a 5x7 out of this camera, but nothing higher.

I generally save my images to CD-ROM and only print the ones I want to display in frames.  I've found that my $200 Epson Photo 700 Printer produces amazing quality printouts - just make sure and splurge for the photo paper, it's worth it.

The best thing about digital cameras is they make wasting film a thing of the past - if you don't like the picture you just took, you can immediately delete it.  Therefore, you can be a bit more risky in taking shots - this generally makes for more memorable shots.

A word of warning, most digital cameras (and this one is no exception) suck battery power VERY VERY VERY quickly.  Definitely buy at least 2 sets of rechargables, as you will need 2 sets just to get through a single day.  Battery life is much better if you turn off the LCD screen on the back of the camera, but then you will not have a preview of what you just shot.

Also, this camera only comes with a 4mb FlashMedia card - I suggest investing in a 16-32mb card, as the 4mb card only holds 11-12 hi-res images (I tend to dump all the images into my laptop at the end of each day - if you don't have a laptop or similar capability, you might need 2 additional FlashMedia cards, depending on how much you plan to shoot in a given day).<br><br>
