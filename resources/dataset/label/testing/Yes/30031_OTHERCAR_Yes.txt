            My father was impressed with a digital camera I recently purchased.  It was actually an Olympus D450 Zoom (1.3 Megapixel).  The Olympus camera works great, and takes great pictures.  But the controls are somewhat non-intuitive and my father is not, shall I say, a technology wizard (he asked me if the photomat knew how to develop films from a digital camera).  So gave me 500 bucks and asked me to get him the absolute best and easiest to use digital camera for him.  After much research, I got him the Kodak DC-280.  When I tried out the camera before delivering it to him, I was awestruck with the quality of pictures it took.  I hate to say it, but it surpassed my own Olympus D450.  This should be no surprise, since the Kodak model can take picture at a hair over 2 megapixels.  I'm ashamed to admit, but it was painful handing over a superior camera to my own father.

I will compare the DC-280 to the Olympus D450, because those are the cameras I am personally familiar with.  The DC-280 is more user friendly because it has better picture icons on it's LCD screen for control.  The picture quality is also superior.  Both cameras, at the times I purchased them, are about the same in price...around 500 dollars.  Actually, the DC-280 was about $20 dollars cheaper (I suspect that the Olympus D450 had a price drop since I bought it for 500 bucks).  The Olympus uses Smartmedia while the Kodak uses Compact Flash cards...if you know an advantage of one over the other, let me know.  The number of features available is comparable.  Both have 3x optical and 2x digital zoom for a maximum of 6x zoom capability.  The Kodak is USB compatible, an vast improvement over the Olympus' serial connection.  But you will still want to consider alternatives for transferring pictures to your computer, such as a card reader or floppy adapter.  The only clear advantage the Olympus has over the Kodak model is the LCD screen.  If you use it during picture taking, the Olympus LCD screen has a less grainy texture.  But in reality, you will want to use the viewfinder to take your photos to conserve battery life.  By the way, the Kodak DC-280 shipped with a recharger AND rechargeable batteries...nice touch.  Don't get me wrong, the Olympus D450 zoom is a great camera and I love mine.  But if the D450 is a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10, the Kodak DC-280 is a 10.  If they are still going at around the same price, than it's a no-brainer...get the Kodak.<br><br>
