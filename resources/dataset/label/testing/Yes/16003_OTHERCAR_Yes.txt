     Every review I see about this car says pretty much only good things; saying that it gives silky smooth ride, very quite...etc...are the people afraid to criticize this car because it is known for best in its class? 
     I apparently think there are better alternative... Camry indeed gives silky smooth rides but I also been in 2000 Mercury Sable (brand new one) which felt smoother than the Camry, also 2000 Hyundai Sonata felt it was smoother than Camry. 
     Stereo system... I really liked Camry's stereo system, but I also had better sound experience in Daewoo Leganza and Mercury Sable (new ones) 
    the Camry with base 4 cylinder engine felt adequate, but it does not feel sporty, Honda Accord, Buick Regal GS, Oldsmobile intrigue and Nissan Maxima offers much sportier ride than Camry. 
     
     I really think the new face lift and rear light change was necesary...when the new Camry first debuted in 1998, I just thought it was plain ugly but the new change gave the Camry more luxurious and sleek looks, I really like the silverish color (super white) on Camry.
     the V-6 engine is very powerful and it feels totally different than the 4 cylinder ones. smoother ride but more gas and costs upto 27k dollars...and there are better alternatives (maxima, 300m, regal, intrigue..etc) 
     I still like the Camry, their reliability has not been beaten, its new style makes the car look more luxurious... I think people who are not tight on money, who doesnt care about sleek looking car and people who doesnt have time to go to the dealer for check ups
