            I love digital photography, this is one of three digital cameras that I own.  I am partial to Polaroid, they make digital cameras with great quality, at half the price of comparative cameras by other companies.

Megapixel, and zoom were the two features I was looking for when buying this particular camera, and when I first received it, I was disappointed.  If it wasn't for the fantastic quality (I have 8x10 photo quality prints from this camera, beautiful!) I would have sent it back, it is not easy to use.   The PDC 640 is so simple, I expected this to be the same.  It is not.

Now that I have had the camera for a few months, and have taken literally hundreds of pictures with it, I love it! 

A few things to keep in mind - super and high quality take forever to save, if you touch the button, or shut the camera off, before the red light goes out, you will have lost the picture. These settings are meant for still shots, movement will make the entire picture blurry.  If you are taking action shots, or in a hurry, change your settings to medium, you will still get very nice quality pictures, they will save in half the time, and you will not have problems with blurring.

This camera will not work with cheap batteries, or on low battery power.  If you have trouble keeping your settings, or taking pictures, buy better batteries.  Duracell Ultra are best, if you do not want rechargeables.  I personally use rechargeables, and can get about 30 pictures on high quality, off 4 batteries before recharging.   On medium, I can get a whole lot more pictures.  Two good sets of no memory rechargeable keep me from ever having a problem, and I do take a lot of pictures.

Take the time to read the book, it explains all the settings and options, there are some nice features on this camera, if you have the time to use them.  

Overall, I love this camera and wouldn't part with it, but if you are new to digital cameras, or do not have patience with things like this, I would recommend the PDC 640, a very decent camera that is super simple to use, and very cheap.
