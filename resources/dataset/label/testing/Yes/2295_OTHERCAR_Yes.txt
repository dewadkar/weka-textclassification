                 I am a soldier stationed at Fort Drum New York, and shortly after I arrived there i found myself without a car. After having never purchased a new car and my wife insisting that's what we buy, I began shopping for the best thing in my price range. Now being a soldier I don't make a lot of money so i had to watch how much I spent. I found my Kia. The dealer was friendly and more helpful then anyone else I had encountered in my short stint and was more then willing to work within my budget. That was a year ago. Since then I have seen my car perform where others in her class failed and have overall been impressed by her overwhelming durability.<br><br>
