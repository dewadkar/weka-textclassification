            This is the first digital still camera I've ever owned, although I have had the (mis)fortune of using an early-model (640x480) Sony Mavica. I got the PhotoPC 650 because it has the best price in its class (US $270 equivalent). Digital camera availability in the Philippines is quite poor, limited mostly to Kodak and some Casio and Olympus models, plus a horde of cheap, low-resolution webcam type devices.

I'm not much of a photographer, I've never really had the bug, and my experience with digital cameras is minimal. The PhotoPC 650 has its strong points -- fairly good resolution (1152x864) for its price, a generous memory capacity (8MB CompactFlash; the Kodak DC215 only comes with 4MB), fairly good cycling time per shot, and good software support -- I use Linux with the GPhoto application which handles the PhotoPC 650 quite well. The camera also has 37mm threads for optional camcorder-style wide-angle, macro- or telephoto lenses, and a tripod mount. The latter two functions are of somewhat dubious utility: it doesn't make very much sense to buy an expensive tripod or telephoto lens and attach it to a low-end camera like the PhotoPC 650.

The bad parts: no optical zoom. This is a low-end camera; the only similar models with an optical zoom are the Casio QV5000SX/QV5500SX and Kodak DC215, which both cost about US $70 more. The Kodak could be considered a better buy, but unlike the PhotoPC 650, it has a fixed-focus lens, so long-range shots tend to be a bit fuzzy.

More bad stuff: the autofocus is completely stumped by long-range night shots. There's no manual exposure timing so long-range night shots are impossible. I tried one, but it was ugly; even after fixing up in a photo enhancement program, there was too much noise. Of course, short range shots can be handled well enough, using the built-in flash.

It's a bit on the bulky side, and the viewfinder is not a &quot;through the lens&quot; type. Of course these features shouldn't be expected in a camera in this price range. The PhotoPC 650 I got is the Asian version; no JumpShot USB reader. So downloading pictures can be an excruciatingly slow experience (about 20 seconds per shot).

All in all, however, the PhotoPC 650 satisfies its intended audience, who are looking for a first camera for simple point-and-shoot applications. People with slightly higher aspirations might be better served by the Kodak DC215 Millennium Edition, which has a 2X optical zoom and a manual exposure adjustment, which might make it handle those night shots better. <br><br>
