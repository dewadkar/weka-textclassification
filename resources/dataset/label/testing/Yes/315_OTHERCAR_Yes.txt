            The 2000 Nissan Xterra is definitely one of the pleasant surprises to hit the auto market in recent years.  With its sleek design and comfortable ride, this car is a BUY for any prospective SUV buyers.  Before we go into the pros and cons of the car, let's first go into some general info on this car

 The car has 4 doors and seats 5 passengers comfortably.   It comes with a 3.3-liter V6 with 170 hp (SE) or a 4-cylinder with 143 hp (XE).  There is an option for a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission with 2 or 4 wheel drive.  The gas tank has a 19-gallon capacity, so your tank of gas can get a bit pricey.  You'll get approximately 15 gallons in the city and 19 on the freeway.  The base model, the XE 4x2 will cost you about $17,349.  However, a fully loaded SE V6 4x4 will cost you almost $27,000.  Still at this price it is probably cheaper than other SUVs on the market.

Now the pros and cons of this car.

<b>Pros</b>

1. <b>Price.</b>  The Xterra is definitely one of the more affordable SUVs.  Even the fully loaded Xterra is cheaper than the Toyota 4Runner (2000 4Runner SR5 4x4 MSRP $27,107) or Ford Explorer (2000 Explorer 4x2 MSRP $27,185).  Keep in mind that I am comparing the price of a FULLY LOADED Xterra vs base or near base line 4Runner and Explorer.

2. <b>Solid Feel.</b>  Unlike other SUV that can get edgy when driving, the Xterra has a smooth ride.  I'm no car expert so I can't explain why it's a smoother ride.  But having driven many cars, this is one of the more solid cars. 

3. <b>Design.</b>  The design of this car is very eye appealing.  On a recent test drive, I noticed many &quot;double takes&quot; as I test drove this car.  However, this car is probably more suitable for the young active person.  A feature that I particularly like is the rack.  Unlike some racks that are only used for its aesthetic purposes, this rack is actually very versatile and can hold up to 125 lbs.  

4. <b>Cargo Space.</b>  To further emphasize its ability for rugged use, the Xterra has a cargo space that allows for rugged use.  In addition to having tons of room, it also has hooks in the floor and ceiling to secure all of your outdoor gear.  This provides safety in addition to usefulness.

<b>Cons</b>

1. For all that's going for the Xterra, one thing that it is weak on is the HP on the car.  If you are buying the car for it's off road use, the SE is the way to go.  I think the XE is too weak.  Perhaps in the next model, Nissan will be more generous on the Horses.

2. Like all SUV, the gas mileage ain't the greatest.  No need to explain more here.

3. For you people who like to look pretty while driving, there are no vanity mirrors on the visors.

Overall, this is a great looking car with a great feel.  It is affordable to many.  As a result this may be a car that &quot;everyone&quot; has.  So if you want to be unique, this may not be the car for you.
