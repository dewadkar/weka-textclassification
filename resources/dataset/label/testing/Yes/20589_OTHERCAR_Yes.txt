            The A4 was on my short list of recommendations to my wife last year when she went about replacing her ten year old 1990 Audi 80.  After two test drives, she chose the A4 1.8T/quattro with automatic.  That was a year ago.  Today, both of us still like the car and everything about it.  Mechanically, we�ve had no problems.


Before I make a general comment, two very A4-specific comments:

* The stock 1.8t motor runs Unleaded REGULAR gas just fine.

* Petite women should carefully examine seating positions on new cars.  Several makes, including Mercedes, BMW and Saab all have very long seat cushions which can impinge on the back of the knee and cause discomfort on longer drives (not immediately obvious on test-drives).  Optional Sports Seats are generally worse.  Measure your femur length and the seat depth of the cars you�re looking at in addition to test-driving them:  you�ll find that the Audi A4�s seat cushion lengths is slightly shorter than most and this may be a critical issue for your comfort.

In reading through the A4 reviews, I see some complaints about dealers.  Let us not forget that unscrupulous dealers really exist in all car brands; I hope that reviewers can do us a favor and update their reviews to name the bad apples.  We found that Audi of Bernardsville (NJ) wasn�t at all interested in doing any work to earn our sale, which was their loss:  Paul Miller (Parsippany, NJ) does pretty well by us, and has limited Saturday service hours.

There were two criticisms that I don�t really agree with.  These are that the car is "too small" and �too slow�.  Well, folks, let�s look at the facts.

On �small�, per the EPA, the A4�s 88ft^3 interior volume officially classifies it as a �Subcompact� car.  Yup, its a small car.  

However, high quality subcompacts such as the A4 are very rare in the US marketplace, particularly one with reasonably sporty handling.  Since my wife and I don�t like �big� cars, we were happy to find the A4.  The bottom line: if you don�t want a small car, then simply don�t buy one - - this type of complaint was like whining that a motorcycle only has two wheels.

Now for this size class of car, the A4�s interior is used effectively, has a good layout and it doesn�t feel cramped.  The 3 Series is most certainly �tighter�.  The headroom & legroom are good and the rear headroom is downright superior.  If you are of average size (which is 5�8� and 170lbs for the 50th percentile male), you shouldn�t have a problem �fitting� into an A4, its subcompact classification notwithstanding.  

On the �too slow� claim, well, 0-60mph times are irrational obsessions for Americans that all too frequently get overemphasized.   The A4 1.8t is nearly 25% faster than the classical VW Scirocco 8v and the Scirocco was considered �very quick�.  In reality, its 0-60 mph time was 11.0 seconds, but it _felt_ fast because a very low 1st gear launched it off the line quickly�faster 0-20 than a Mustang in its day.  Its all perception.

Granted, expectations have changed over the years, but you need to decide what is honestly adequate and how much is really because you want a �toy car�.  Critical to this self-evaluation is just how much dry weather performance you�re willing to trade off versus reduced ice and snow performance brought about by excessive torque driven by a ham-footed driver.   I can tell you from firsthand experience that a 1985 Porsche 911 is absolutely no fun on a cold, snowy road.  Similarly, it is unrealistic to expect that the added mass of Quattro (4WD) will not incur any performance penalty. 

In my assessment, the A4, even with the base 1.8t, has adequate power for what is generally needed for a well balanced compact 4-door sedan.  It is merely up to you as to how well you manage it.  

Which brings us to the real problem:  we all think we�re above average.  We�re not.  One of my more sobering revelations was to watch a guy in a �lousy stinking� (stock) Neon beat my Porsche 911�s autocross lap times�what an eye opener!   My recommendation is that if you want a faster car, don�t waste your money on an upgraded engine until after you�ve taken some good high-performance driver training.
