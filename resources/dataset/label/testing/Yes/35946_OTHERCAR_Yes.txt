            I bought this Camera from overstock for $200.00. Recomended retail on the JVC web site was over $1000.00 so I figured it must be good quality.
I bought this for several reasons.
Wanted a solid metal body camera.
Wanted at least 3 megapixel.
Didnt want to spend over $200.00
Optical zoom.
This camera fitted the bill.

Even though it was advertised as refurb on overstock apart from the battery everything appeared new.
Now for the critique.

Using the camera after reading the instructions was extremely easy I have seen reviews of the sister model the JVC GC-QX3U saying it is a complicated camera to use this is not true this is my first digital camera it was very user friendly. Read the setup instructions for about 10 minutes and you will be ok.
The camera itself is really well made compared to more expensive camera's it really feels and looks good.
I got a cheap card reader even though you can hook it up to a usb port extracting the mem card and copying to my hard drive was a cinch.
The 16meg card it came with allows for 16 pics at good resolution.
I bought a 64meg mem card which is the maximum this camera will allow for $20.00 Circuit City(64 pics).
I also bought a new battery on e-bay for $25.00 as a backup.
Even though I had no problems with the battery life of the initial battery. I managed to take 44 pics off one battery charge.
The optical zoom is really good it is an aspherical lens and appears to be really good quality.
The pictures themselves are ok I dont give it 5 stars this may be a digital thing but indoors photo's are from mediocre to good but never outstanding.
The flash sometimes takes a long time to charge but I have the same problem with my canon elf.
I print my own pictures using an Canon S820.
Canon products are really outstanding this printer is superb.
On Canon Glossy paper I say the pics come out about 97% as good as my APS Canon Elf.
Dont expect the costs to be low it works out about the same as APS developing at Sams and more expensive then 35mm developing.
But it is a great and convenient experience.
I can take pics and print within minutes.

My overall experience of this camera is favourable at $200.00.
I would not pay more.
I am impressed but not overwhelmed.
I think for $200.00 this is a good quality camera which will last a long time.
