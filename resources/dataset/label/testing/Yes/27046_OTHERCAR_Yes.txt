            The 3x wide/long optical zoom is absolutely indispensable, I can't believe I almost bought a digital camera without one. The Mac version of their software is not good- it doesn't background, so your computer's useless for about ten minutes while it sucks the images out. Download Cameraid (http://www.cameraid.com) and register it, it's super cheap, pulls images from the camera in the background, has a much better image preview, and cures acne. I'm a bit disappointed at the quality of the images, but this is my first digital camera so maybe digital's not up to the task yet. The high resolution leaves a good amount of overhead to clean the picture up
before scaling the picture down- I almost always run a sharpen filter over the images. And it does really fun stuff under black lights.. The blue channel always comes out extremely grainy, but that might happen with all digital cameras.<br><br>
