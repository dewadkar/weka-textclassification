            I had my eye on the Monte Carlo for a few years before I gave in and bought one!  I purchased the 1998, in 1998 it had 30 miles on it!  The only draw back, is that it is red, and there are a million red Monte Carlo's on the road.  At first it was terrible on gas mileage.  I would only get about 150-175 miles per gallon.  After a few months of driving it, the gas mileage got better.  I now get 260-300 miles per gallon.  It has a very smooth ride, it doesn't even sound like it's running.  Even after 2+ years, it is still a very quiet car.  It has only been in the shop for oil changes and tire rotation.  It has good pick up, and is very comfortable for long rides. I have a 3 year old son, and I feel confident driving on expressways, and long country roads with him in the car that we will not break down.  The air conditioner and the heater work great, and it warms up in the winter fairly quickly!  I would definately recommend purchasing the Monte Carlo!<br><br>
