            I've got to tell you, when I first saw the 2001 Aurora I was a bit under whelmed. Not that it wasn't a good-looking car; it just didn't stand out the way the original Aurora did. But the more I looked at it, the more I liked it. It is a handsome car. Lately I'm finding it's difficult to find fault with the fit and finish of today's vehicles. Go ahead and check one out - the cut lines around the doors, hood, and trunk are uniformly even and tight. First impressions are important, and when you look at a car and
everything looks right the first time, it just gives you a feeling that the car was put together with care. The Aurora has that look.
   I also like cars that have a bit of stealth about them (especially after my notorious speeding ticket). Flashy cars are nice but for rapid transit, give me one that doesn't stand out in a crowd. What could be more &quot;part of the pack&quot; than a medium to large four-door sedan? 
    And with Oldsmobile's 4.0-liter, DOHC, 32-valve V8 powering the Aurora, stealth might be a good thing. The V8 sends 250 HP through a 4-speed automatic transmission to the front wheels. The engine has proven itself in Oldsmobile's for the past few years and a version of it has powered the winner of the Indy 500. The engine sure sounded right too - it had a neat DOHC V8 growl from under the hood with a nice rumble out the twin tailpipes. <br><br>
