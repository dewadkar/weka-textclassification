            In the fall of 1991, shortly after discovering I was pregnant with my second child, we decided to upgrade from the small 1985 <b>Ford Escort</b> we owned and purchase a newer and larger vehicle.  And as luck would have it, we found a solid white 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> on sale for $10,500 at our local dealership.  Because it was a "program car", our <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> only had around 6000 miles on it at the time.  So we ended up purchasing an almost new vehicle for a used price.  And for almost 10 years now, I've been very pleased with our purchase.

<b>APPEARANCE:</b>  Our 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> is solid white in color without that tacky black "stripe" that goes down the side of most older vehicles in the same line.  Even though our car is 10 years old, it still has the original factory paint job and looks very good considering it's age.  Of course there are a few minor dents and scratches in the paint job from regular highway use, but overall our <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> remains a very attractive looking vehicle considering its age.  Parking it protected from the elements under a carport for many years can take some of this credit.

<b>FEATURES:</b>  This particular 1990 two door <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> has an automatic transmission with a V6, 3.1 liter engine.  Other basic features you'll find are: driver side airbag, power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, AM/FM (stereo) radio with cassette deck, manual windows and door locks, cup holders, and bucket cloth seats with a console between them.  

<b>ROOMINESS:</b>  Even though the 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> will comfortably seat 4, two adults and two of which are preferably children in the back seat, now that our third child is almost a year old, we have no problems fitting a rear-facing car seat in the back, adding a 5th rider.  Yes, the back is now a bit crowded with a child on each side of the car seat when driving somewhere with the entire family, but we've learned to manage quite nicely with what we have, childhood spats and all.

<b>TRUNK SPACE:</b>  You'll find plenty of trunk space available in the 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> for those trips to the grocery store as well as for larger distance  road trips.  Along with housing a full sized stroller, I can easily fit a weeks worth of groceries for 5 inside our trunk whenever I go shopping with ease.  This car has taken us on several 900 mile road trips to Florida as well even though packing a weeks worth of stuff for 4 people into the trunk of our <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> was somewhat of a challenge.  

<b>FAMILY FRIENDLINESS:</b>  Because the 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> was designed to be a sports car featuring 2 doors, it's not exactly the ideal choice for those with children who prefer the convenience of a 4 door vehicle.  But as I mentioned above, a car seat and two older children can somewhat easily fit into the back seat without too much trouble.  Since we've never owned a 4 door car and "don't know what we are missing," this has seldom been a problem for us.  Yes, it can be quite tiring at times loading and unloading a 24 pound toddler to and from his car seat in a two door vehicle, such as the 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b>, but I can certainly use the exercise this practice provides.

<b>RELIABILITY:</b>  As of this moment, our 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> has over 125,500 miles on it and is still going strong.  Other than regular maintenance and a few minor problems, this has been the most reliable vehicle I've ever owned.  Keeping the oil changed every 3000-5000 miles and having regular tune-ups done has really made a difference in this car's long lasting performance . 

<b>POWER & HANDLING:</b>  Being a somewhat small, sporty  car with a V6 engine, my 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> accelerates from a parked position to normal highway speeds very quickly, even with an automatic transmission.  Because it's fairly low to the ground as well, this car "hugs" curves without much difficulty and turns well too.  Unlike many larger vehicles, the <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> handles excellently and very easily fits into parking spaces at the mall.  

<b>AFFORDABILITY:</b>  Of course if bought used today, the figures would be much different, but we financed our <b>1990 Chevrolet Beretta</b> for 5 years (60 months), making monthly payments of around $255 each month.  Since 1996, this vehicle has been paid for, so I've gotten very used to NOT having to make a car payment anymore!  But at the above price, these payments very easily fit into our family's transportation budget.  This vehicle has been well worth the money we paid and then some.

<b>GAS MILEAGE:</b>  Especially in today's times, a vehicle's gas mileage is more important than ever with the skyrocketing gas prices we've been experiencing recently.  Even at 10 years of age, our 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> gets approximately 25 miles to the gallon.  The gas tank holds 15 gallons of gasoline, so lately it's been taking more than $20 to fill it up each time when using the regular grade of fuel.  Oh...to go back to the days when $12 or $13 would fill 'er up!

<b>CONS:</b>  Other than not being the most family friendly car on the road, I must say there is one thing that I absolutely DISLIKE about my 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b>.  This feature is the windshield wiper design.  There are only two speeds:  "fast" and "super fast".  So when driving in drizzling rain, I'm forced to either listen to the "scraping" of dry windshield wipers against the glass or to keep turning the wipers on and off to clear the rain off periodically instead of leaving them turned on all the time.  And in the "super fast" position, the wipers will actually move outside the windshield area and onto the trim work, ruining the integrity of the trim.  

<b>FINAL RECOMMENDATION:</b>  If you are looking for a reliable yet sporty means of transportation and are on a budget, consider purchasing the 1990 <b>Chevrolet Beretta</b> from your local used car dealership.  I've trusted this model for almost 10 years now and will drive mine until the wheels fall off!  If only half of the vehicles on the road today were this reliable....
