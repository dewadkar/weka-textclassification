            I bought my Chevrolet Prism because I wanted a car with really good gas mileage since I was driving 50 miles one-way to work.  Of the 4 models I test drove in this price range it had the smoothest ride.  I usually get around 31 miles to the gallon.  I love the way my Prism handles.  I feel safe with its pick-up when I need to drive on the highway.  And feel confident when my teenage son wants to borrow it that it is reliable.  My four door Prism is comfortable enough for me to sit in the back with my two younger children when my six foot son is driving .  You can fit 5 adults in comfort for trips up to an hour long. And 4 for longer than that.
unfortunately it does not have a lot of leg room in the back for taller people. I enjoy my 100 mile commute each day thanks to my Prism.  It is small enough to park easily in the crowded parking area and large enough to drive the girls to lunch.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a comfortable, affordable car with good gas mileage.  Taller people may find it a little tight fitting.        <br><br>
