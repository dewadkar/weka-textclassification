            First, let me say that this car is gorgeous!  Without fail, every time I have driven this car with the top down, someone compliments me on my car.  Even with the top up, the car still stands out.  It is jet black, with a light gray interior.  Truth of the matter is, I wasn't even in the market for another car.  I already owned a 90 Celica GT at the time, but I fell in love with this car the moment I saw it.  The car looks even more amazing with blue HID beams replacing the stock lights and fog lamps.
Driving the car is always an adventure.  You can feel the road perfectly.  It has smooth handling and takes corners amazingly well.  The car is just as stable at 20 as it is at 60.  This car has wonderful pickup for a 4-cylinder engine, and I was impressed with the gas mileage.  The car also has push button ECT, Electronically Controlled Transmission, for those times you want that little extra power, and overdrive.  The transmission shifts well, and at high speeds you can really feel the torque (that's a good thing!).  The top folds up and down smoothly, and with the boot on, it looks incredible, however, you cannot lower or raise the top while the car is in motion.
The car is a little noisy, and can be a little drafty at high speeds with the top up.
The stock sound system on the car is fair.  The head unit has a cassette deck and a CD player built in.  The car has 4 four inch speakers, which could have been larger to accommodate for more powerful speakers, 2 three quarter inch tweeters, and (this impressed me) eight inch woofers in the doors.  There is also an amplifier to power the woofers.  The sound is OK, but not acceptable for an audiophile like myself, though the double DIN space in the dash is very accommodating to any upgrade in the head unit.
The ergonomics of the interior are fair as well, though I was never impressed with the placement of the ashtray, cigarette lighter and the cup holders.  It is hard to fit a large drink into the cup holders, and anything there gets in the way of access to the radio.  In order to use the cup holders, you need to take out the lighter and push in the ashtray.  Other than those complaints, the rest of the interior is fine.
I wouldn't recommend this car for the feint of heart.  The speedometer tops out at 120, but while I doubt that it can reach that speed, I know it can come close.  The car is solid, but you feel every bump in the road and you can feel the speed you are traveling at.  The car is made to give you an adrenalin rush while driving, and that it does very well.
I also wouldn't recommend this car as a family or primary car.  There isn't enough room in the back seat to comfortably fit an adult (with the drivers seat all the way back, it almost touches the back seat).There is a huge trunk, which only increases when you put the folding rear seat down.  <br><br>
