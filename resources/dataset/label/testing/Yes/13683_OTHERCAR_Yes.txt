            I had a '96 Trooper and didn't like it very well. Near the end of my 3 year lease I was going to turn it in and go for a 4 Runner or the new Jeep Grand Cherokee.   Neither of the latter dealerships could come up with a &quot;good deal&quot;, looking at $480 for the 4 runner and $530 on the Jeep.

I received a great offer from GECAL and Isuzu in the mail, so I went to the Isuzu dealer.  The 99 Trooper is much improved over the '96....much more power and engine torque.

I got the Luxury package....heated leather seats, large sunroof, and lot of other goodies....AND GECAL and ISUZU made the last two payments on my '96, the FIRST payment on my '99, $5000 off the sticker, and no money up front.  My payments are $418 w/sales tax on a 4 yr lease.

Disregard the negative Consumer Reports because ALL SUV's are &quot;tippy&quot;, especially when driven in such a manner as CR did.  The ONLY way any individual would swerve the vehicle like CR did is in an emergency evasive maneuver.<br><br>
