            The Toyota Camry is the best car on the market for the money.  It is comfortable and still has class.  It is a car that any middle income family can afford.

I am a private detective and I spend many hours at a time in my vehicle.  I am sometimes forced to eat and sleep in my car.  Toyota is comfortable and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  

Toyota Camry will stop quickly and pick back up to a high rate of speed quickly.  It drives with ease and gives you confidence that you are in control of your vehicle.

I would recommend a Toyota Camry to anyone.  The old and young alike will both enjoy this car tremendously!  I should know, I own four of them!<br><br>
