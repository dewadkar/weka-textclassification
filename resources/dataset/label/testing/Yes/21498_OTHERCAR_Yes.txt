            There is much to love about the 1999 &quot;new&quot; Golf. Ours is a 4door GLS with the luxury package purchased brand new. It was one of the first the dealer sold and it really turned heads when we first got it. Other Volkswagen drivers recognized it as the new Golf and I noticed other drivers speeding up or slowing down to get a look at it. We had never had a car that generated that kind of interest before. Looks are one of the cars best features. What a neatly detailed package from the dramatic headlights to the way the rear door follows the contour of the tail lights. A lot of thought went into the Golf's styling. The GLS with the luxury package is well equipped. It feels in many ways like a mini BMW or Mercedes.

The interior is well laid out and the materials are of high quality. The velour seats are infinitely adjustable and very very comfortable. Interestingly the velour used in the Golf attracts lint and dirt like a magnet. It is virtually impossible to keep clean. I have never seen any thing like it. After 26,000 miles the interior has developed a disappointing number of squeaks and rattles. 

Performance wise 115 horsepower is weak compared to a lot of the Golf's rivals , especially at GLS prices. We have the stick shift which is well geared allowing you to use all 115 of those horses to best advantage but I thought the automatic felt quite underpowered. The payoff is good gas mileage which has averaged over 30mpg. Volkswagen has biased the suspension of the GLS towards ride as opposed to handling. The Golf indeed has a great ride for a subcompact but lacks the handling prowess of VWs past. The brakes , 4 wheel antilock discs are exceptional. Our Golf has traction control which is greatly appreciated in upstate New York.

Volkswagen quality has been a bit disappointing. The power moon roof has never worked properly and the dealer has been unable to fix it. As stated earlier in the review the car has developed some squeaks and rattles. When we initially purchased the car one of the things that had impressed us was the seemingly vault like build quality. Sadly this hasn't held up. 

Having said this , my wife is the primary driver of the car and she absolutely loves it. I had loftier expectations but concede there is much to love about the car and on a day to day basis the good outweighs the bad. <br><br>
