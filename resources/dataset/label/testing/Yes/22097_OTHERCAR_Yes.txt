              My mother bought me the Kodak DC215 for my birthday this year.  I never had any idea what I was in for.  I have never been so amazed in all of my life.
  This camera features 2x zoom, 1 megapixel, quick upload, excellent Adobe software, Flash memory Card, review screen, live feed review, cables for tv plug in, and so many features I'd be here all night trying to list them all.
  There's so much to do with this camera.  Take the photo, upload it, go into the software and create for hours.  You can put your photos on numerous backgrounds, cut and paste others into the photo with you and more!
  The camera is so simple to use that my 6 year old nephew takes photos with it and enjoys it almost as much as I do.  He thinks it's great that he can see himself on that little screen too!
  Batteries really deplete quickly, so I'd have to recommend buying the adapter, which can be purchased through Kodak on their website, ordered from a camera dealer, or even purchased from QVC!  Rechargable batteries are also recommended, as well as an extra flash card!
  Throw those old cameras and the film away!  Technology is here and with this camera, technology is terrific!  I'll never go back!
