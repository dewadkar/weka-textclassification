            I returned to epinions several times to compare digital cameras before deciding on the Fuji FinePix 2600Zoom.  Since it was so helpful to me, I hope to be helpful to you.  This is my second digital camera in 4 months.  The first one I bought on a whim off of eBay without doing much research and apparently without reading the fine print in the ad because I thought I was getting a 2M camera, but it ended up having less than 1M of resolution.  I should have known better.  It was a no name Visual Land camera and after barely using it for 3 months, you can't even determine what you've taken a picture of because the image quality is so bad.  There was no warranty and although they claim to have excellent customer service and technical support, their last comment to me was, "There must be something wrong with the sensor, some other company makes that part.  We can't help you."  So please do not waste your money on any camera from Visual Land.  

With that said, let me tell you about my new toy.  First of all, after reading many reviews and product comparisons, I knew what I was looking for this time. . . 1.) at least 2 megapixels of resolution because I wanted good quality pictures to be able to print out sometimes. 2.) at least 3X optical zoom because I wanted to be able to take close ups and macro shots.
3.) I don't really know anything about white balance or very many of those other photographic features, so I needed something that I could basically just point and shoot. 
4.) I wanted to be able to start using the camera right out of the box without having to purchase any accessories or add-ons.
5.) I didn't want something not made anymore or out of date.
6.) I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg.

Well, the only camera that fit all my qualifications in my price range without buying something refurbished was the Fuji 2600.  It's the perfect balance of ease and options.  It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and recharger, a 16MB memory card and everything else I mentioned above besides all the positive recommendations from other users and reviewers.

I've had my camera for a few weeks now and have used it for close-ups of watches I've sold on eBay, outdoor pictures at the zoo, and indoor pictures of my daughter.  So far, I haven't come across any problems.  

The only gripe I have is the owner's manual.  It is so confusing.  I'm using it with Windows XP home edition which it is compatible with, but there are several places in the manual where you have to replace the instructions with the ones from an insert.  I don't usually have problems with following directions but these just blew my mind.  I eventually got everything working fine and where it insists that you must use the included software, I find that I prefer just hooking the camera up to the computer and choosing to upload the pictures directly into the My Pictures folder of Windows.  I haven't had a problem doing this at all so far so I don't know why they practically demand that you use their picture viewer.

Anyway, what you get for the price of this camera can't be beat.  After going to all the price comparison sites, I found the best deal from Future Computers of South Florida.  http://www.fcsf.com  Considering that they were offering free same-day shipping, the $219.70 I paid was the cheapest I could find.  Their website does need a lot of work, but I was able to find the product on it and called to confirm availability and that this was not refurbished or gray market, and did in fact have a US warranty.  All was well and I placed my order online and received it in 2 days.

One other thing I would like to mention is the included batteries.  The first time you plug them in, the charge light goes off after only 2 hrs when it says it will take 5.  Go ahead and use them till the batteries go dead, which won't take very long.  It will take about 3 charges and full uses until the batteries are finally conditioned and will last a very long time.
