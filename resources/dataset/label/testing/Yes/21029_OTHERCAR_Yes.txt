            This camera is an excellent choice for both armatures and semi-pro digital photography users. I had previously owned the Sony DSC-S70 digital camera which has very similar specs, but is much bulkier and uses the more superior Carl Zeiss lens system. The main features that convinced me to change cameras were the following:

- Camera Size- planning a trip to Malaysia and wanted something smaller
- Retractable lens with automatic lens cover- much safer when travelling
- Continuous MPEG Movies- with the S70 you are limited to 15-60 seconds of video. With the P5, you can continue shooting until you memory stick is full.
- AF Illuminator- good feature for dark indoor shots
- Simpler Navigation and quick access to many functions.

In terms of image quality of the P5, I must say that I am very impressed. I was initially wary of the different lens type but was proved wrong after the first few shots. Colour saturation is good and both the manual and automatic functions perform close to their non-digital counterparts.

I would recommend this camera for a person that wants a very high quality point and shoot camera, that is also looking for some manual features to test their abilities.
