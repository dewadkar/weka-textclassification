            If you're one of the shutterbug types, you'll love Agfa's EPhoto CL30 Clik digital camera. Being a high-volume shooter, I bought this camera just because of its built-in revolutionary Clik drive. Thanks to this, the EPhoto supplies plentiful storage for all your images. Moreover, Clik disks come cheap as compared to compact flash cards.

The best part of this deal is the fact that typically Clik disks can store up to 60 high-resolution pictures (1152 by 864 pixels) or 360 low-resolution ones (640 by 480 pixels). And once a disk is full, you can swap out a Clik disk in no time and resume shooting.

Besides this, the EPhoto comes with a built-in flash, which I found to be very handy. Also, its controls are intuitive and extremely simple to use, with three-way manual zone focus - macro, portrait, and distant. The unit also comes with a 2X digital zoom which I don't use very often. An optical zoom would have been much better as it yields sharper images than digital zoom, but Agfa seem to have forgotten about it.

Another handy feature is the capability of attaching optional filters or a telephoto lens to the EPhoto. But perhaps the best part is that when connected to a PC via its USB cable, it behaves as a regular hard drive. In conclusion, data transfers are fast and easy. 

Now for the results: Pictures come out good with the flash on, but look somewhat grainy when shot in less than ideal light. Its maximum resolution is 1152 by 864 pixels, but you can bump it all the way up to a massive 1440 by 1080 using Agfa's PhotoGenie software included with the unit. I found the colours pleasing but images lack the amount of sharpness normally seen in 35mm shots. What you can do is try enhancing the contrast. That way you'll end up improving the sharpness of the image.

The EPhoto runs on four AA batteries. A major disadvantage of the Clik drive is the fact that it takes up too much power. Consequently, the batteries don't last long and drain fast. Also, I found this camera to be quite heavy, weighing around 370g. Plus it has an awkward design, making it difficult to hold on to for a long time. As a result of its Clik drive, you do have to wait a bit longer between shots than with most other cameras. So, you can certainly forget about burst shooting i.e. taking multiple pictures in rapid succession. 

In conclusion, the EPhoto may be the right camera for you if you are a "frequent shooter" interested in a relatively low-end camera that can satisfy all your basic needs. However, you'll find it to be a huge disappointment if you're looking for a feature-rich camera that can capture video or audio.
