            How does one communicate when an inanimate object has a certain je nes se qua that makes it almost an extension of oneself? I'm not quite sure. But what I am sure of is that my 1+ year search for that 'just right' digital camera has concluded successfully with my purchase of the Fuji S5000. A smooth purchase by phone for $329.95 from 17th Street photo I might add (review posted here at Epinions.com to communicate my satisfaction with doing business with the firm).

The Fuji has been in hand since October 31 and I've already banged out hundreds of shots, a bunch of video CDs, prints at Costco (that look great and cost all of 19 cents per 4 x 6), and even blew up some of my favorite shots to 8 x 10 ($2.99 at Costco). It is moving my venerable Minolta X-700  into semi-retirement. The Minolta is responsible for a mountain of memories in the form of a few thousand prints of my family. See, my wife purchased the X-700 for me as a wedding present 15 years ago. Before the three kids came along (now 11, 10 and 8), the Standard Poodle (now 12), and, well, you get the idea. These memories are priceless and require the right piece of equipment to acquire if one is even mildly serious about their photography.

The Fuji S5000 simply takes beautiful pictures. And the movie function grabs fun AVI clips, and once you get a better (i.e., larger) xD card (128 meg or higher is a must to make this camera useful), you can combine a large quantity of stills and movie clips. Say, enough to make a nice video CD of a visit to the Botanical Gardens (Bronx, NY). That's what I've been doing, combining stills and video using Muvee Autoproducer 3 to make video CDs of compiled images and footage (and the clips include audio with this camera). Bang out a quick 'music video' using Autoproducer and everyone sits down and enjoys the day all over again (assuming your DVD player plays video CDS [all the newer ones do, including the $49.95 Toshiba's]).

But what about that above-referenced je nes se qua 'factor'? This camera just feels right in the hand, is easy to use, and pulls down images with a superior tonal quality using its automatic mode. I had to take the manual to bed a couple of nights to read through the functions but that review, with some use, brought things together when combined with my previous manual SLR experience, all gained on my Minolta.

I have come across few down-sides since purchasing the S5000 and using it regularly. The next-to-last 'troubleshooting' entry on page 104 of the Owner's manual is, "The camera no longer works correctly." The listed solution is basically an IBM-computer style 're-boot', i.e., take the batteries out and put them back in. I find I have to 're-boot' the camera occasionally and I simply slide the battery cover to the open position until the batteries disengage from their terminals and then click it back into place. Works every time although it was a bit weird the first time the camera refused to turn off (the green light stayed on) after I had turned it OFF. Also, video at any distance is much more grainy than close-in video.

Needless to say the included 16 meg xD card is only good for a handful of images at the lowest resolution. You can find lots of deals on 128, 256, and even 512 meg xD cards so shop around. I picked up a 128 for $69.95 with a $10.00 mail in rebate at Circuit City.

I am very happy with this purchase and enjoy every time I use this piece of equipment. I felt the same way about my old Minolta and a precious few of the equipment purchases I've ever made. Like my recently traded-in 1993 SAAB 9000. My veteran Radio Shack Minimus 7 audio speakers. My 1984 vintage NAD audio equipment that still rocks the house.

The Fuji S5000 is a keeper.
