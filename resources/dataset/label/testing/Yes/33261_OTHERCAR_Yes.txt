            My husband needed a work vehicle and this little guy caught his eye. When he got it home, he discovered that it would not hold all his manly stuff. The bed is shorter than average, so it became my truck. It is perfect for a woman with no kids or even small children, but the back seat does not really fit normal size adults. It has plenty of power, but it is inconvenient at times to have an uncovered bed. Covers are available now  and this would help. There is also a bed extender that comes with it now, or so I am told, that is  helpful for large loads. It just slips in and out, so is easy to steal since the tailgate has no lock. The seats are very comfortable for long trips and the stereo is a good one. I would like more cab storage though. Overall I am very happy with my 4 door truck, but I bought it too soon. Now it has more standard features than when it first came out. <br><br>
