            I own a 96 Eclipse GS that I purchased new in May of 1996.  This is the absolute best car that I have ever owned.  I previously owned a Monte Carlo and a Dodge Daytona and this is by far the best of the three.  I bought the vehicle, yes, mainly because of it's appearance, but I did debate between this car and a talon, which look very similiar.  I eventually went with the Eclipse because it was a somewhat smoother ride.

I am the only owner of my car and I have had no problems, but I have kept my routine maintenance up to date.  I rotate and balance the tires often and I only last weekend had to buy new tires for the car.  I got 60,000 miles on the original ones.  I was very happy about that.  I keep my oil changed frequently and I love the fact that I have not had any major problems with my car.  I did have to replace the timing belt at 60,000 miles, but this is what the company recommends.  They said they have seen engine problems around 60,000 miles when the timing belt wears out.  This was a pretty expensive endeavor, around $500, but nothing compared to what a new engine would cost if the belt had worn out.  At this time I also went ahead and put new fan belts on the car because they had started to wear a little.  Other than that, my car has been almost perfect.

EXCEPT for the radio...This is the only thing I have complaints about of my car.  I paid the extra $800 to get the 10 disc changer in the trunk and I have had nothing but problems with this through the 4 years I have had my car.  Sometimes it will play, and sometimes it won't.  It is very finicky.  While it was still under warranty, I had the stereo replaced, that didn't help.  Then I had the actual CD changer replaced and that didn't help either.  The dealership said it had no more ideas what could possibly be wrong.  So...now I just live with a CD player that plays when it feels like it.  

I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable, fun car to drive.  I love my car and don't plan on ever getting rid of it!!
