            Back in 1995, my dad went shopping for a large car to carry &quot;tons&quot; of things around; yet, at the same time would be comfortable to travel long distances. SUV's were barely in the market and seemed &quot;too big&quot; and expensive. Volkswagen had just introduced a wagon version of the Passat, called Variant, and it seemed perfect for the job. By the way, we lived in Brazil at the time - but the car is the same as the one sold in the U.S., since its MADE IN Germany (the only difference is the name).

PERFORMANCE: We got the I4 version (a.k.a. GL) and abused it to its extremes. We frequently drove over 110 mph on long trips, for who knows how many thousand miles (my dad recently sold it, but I've been in the US for a while so I don't know the mileage).
Reaching high speeds is easy and passing other cars safe. In fact, this car is very safe; especially for a family-oriented buyer.
Like all VW cars, this one will last for a long time - especially if its made somewhere in Europe.
Note that we had a manual transmission and the car made 15km/liter (an educated guess leads me to about 30mpg).

COMFORT: Seats are comfortable both in front and back, suspension is very nice and absorbs most bumps, control is precise and easy to maneuver in wet roads (including very muddy ones). Display and controls is very well laid out and windows are large for good visibility. Also, the A/C won't suffocate the engine and works reasonably fast.

TECHNICAL: We never had a problem with our car and I highly recommend buying the 1995 used Passat wagon. I heard the VR6, or GLX, is even better with onboard trip computer, automatic temperature control, and nicer wheels. Just make sure you get one with ABS brakes. They work very well and you may need them one day. Our car also had dual front airbags.

LOOKS: The '95 Passat looks cool and I wouldn't mind driving one. My friends used to joke ours was a police cruiser, with its nice metallic dark blue painting and cool aerodynamic outside lines. The 1998 is even nicer-looking.

Conclusion: If you are looking into a used wagon, get a Passat or Volvo 850/960. The Passat is excellent.

PS: We were rear-ended once at about 15 mph (we were stopped), and the other car suffered a major nose change. I'm happy to say our bumper was only scratched.
