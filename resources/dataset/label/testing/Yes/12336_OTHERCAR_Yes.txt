            One might think that the 2000 Eclipse GT is just a plain Eclipse.
With a V6 3.0 Litre 24-valve engine I can assure you that it is not your average Eclipse. Eclipses have a good resale value, we bought ours for $24,000 (loaded) and since then the price of that same car has rose to $29,000. I recorded the VIN# off my car one day and looked it up, the VIN# describes the car as a 2000 Mitsubishi GT Super Mitsubishi came into the NEW year with Eclipse more like their 3000 GT Models. Its front and sides can give the impression of a euro-sports car. The NEW Sports-Tronic transmission lets one decide if they want to drive in manual or automatic. The 3-inch exhaust tip makes for a sweet sounding car. 17-inch rims with a low-profile effect also gives it that euro-sports car characteristic. Sound package includes 210-watt Infinity CD and Cassette deck with CD-Changer Controls. 
So on a Sunny, Warm day the 2000 Eclipse would be the perfect car to drive around with the Sunroof up!!<br><br>
