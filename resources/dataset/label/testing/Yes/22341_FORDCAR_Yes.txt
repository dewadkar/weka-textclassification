            I bought this because I wanted a sport-utility that was large, had a usable 3rd-seat, and was spacious, hip, and modern looking. My Expo satisfied these criteria to a T.

I bought the Expedition 2000 Eddie Bauer with an optional power moon roof and I installed a crash guard. I chose the Eddie Bauer over the XLT because for a nominal difference in cost I got all I wanted: great stereo, 6-disc CD player, Class III towing, etc.

I love its all-weather capabilities, and my wife who drives it mostly feels very secure in it, with its great view of the road and excellent braking. We love going camping with this baby, and have taken several road trips to Canada and Florida.

Did I mention the macho appeal of driving something that looks like this?!! But seriously, I found this to be the best bang-for-the-buck. I compared it with a Land Cruiser (too rich for my blood), a Durango (too truck-like and badly designed inside), and a Navigator ($8,000 more for the same vehicle!).
