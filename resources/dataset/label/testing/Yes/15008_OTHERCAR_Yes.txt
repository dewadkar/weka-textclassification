            I received one of these cameras for Christmas. It's one of the best gifts I have ever received. I take all the pictures I want, then go back and decide which pictures I want to have developed.  These cameras may be a little more expensive than other cameras, but the money you can save in developing and film will even out the cost of the camera in no time at all. I also like the fact that I can e-mail photos to my friends and family. I would like for the battery to last a little longer, but I guess the solution to that would be to buy another battery. I have only had this camera for three weeks and already have ten disks full of photos. I have yet to have one of the disks developed but have checked out the prices, which are about $6.00 for twelve prints. I think it's a great camera.<br><br>
