            I am a real estate appraiser who decided that the time had come to control my film costs and needed a reliable digital camera for the job. I looked at a number of products over the years and had not found one that would meet my criteria. Then in August 1998 I came across the 210 Plus and found what I was looking for. It comes with an 8 meg memory card, but I recommend upgrading to a 16 meg card for the additional storage, one never knows how many pictures you want to shoot. It uses 4 batteries that are consumed quickly, I recommend getting a battery charger with additional batteries that provide extended use and you will always have an additional set of batteries when you need them.
The camera is light weight, easy to use, and very transportable. It is also quite sturdy, though this is not a selling point, I am a bit of a klutz and have dropped it on asphalt, concrete and grass and fortunately it takes a licking and keeps on ticking. It is sometimes easy to forget you are carrying it with you so get a case that fits on your belt or can be wrapped around your waist.
I have had excellent results with the camera and my pictures for my appraisals are crisp, clear and color true. I do not print on special paper, I use standard laser grade paper, and see no real need to do so unless you are printing pictures for a special purpose. I have gotten into using it more often than my fancy 35mm when shooting pictures of my friends and their families. I shot pictures of my neighbors new daughter and they turned out better than any shot with 35mm, or with a photographer whom they paid good money for. It is not that I am an expert but I do know how to shoot pictures and when to do it.
If you want a good digital camera and don't want to spend an arm or a leg on it, this is your choice. The price has come down since I bought it and if you shoot lots of pictures the cost will be returned in a very short period of time.
The only negative about this camera is that it only has a 2x zoom, 29mm to 58mm, and does not have an adapter for a longer zoom. This is a headache when you are shooting long distances, but how often would you be doing that?
Buy it you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
