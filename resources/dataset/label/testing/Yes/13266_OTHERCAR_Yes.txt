            I enjoy the Honda Accord LX 1999 with white exterior color we purchased around Nov. 24, 1999. and want to share my purchase experience with you.

We first started our budget for the Toyota Corrolas or Honda Civics.  $13,000-14,000 was the amount we planned for. 

There was a rather long painful time of struggle in deciding which way to go. My wife and I spent more than 2 weeks almost everyday after work in doing research on the Internet car selling websites, such as &lt;http://autoweb.com/&gt;, &lt;http://www.autobytel.com/&gt;, &lt;http://carpoint.msn.com/&gt; and &lt;http://edmunds.com/&gt;.

Under some of those above web sites, there are services that you could find the dealers near you. What you do is just typing in your living address and zip code, it will come up with a bunch of dealers with the directions, map, email addresses, fax numbers etc.

We next started to send fax using JFAX (a free Internet based fax service) or Microsoft Fax (you can set it up by yourself using the Win95/win98), sitting in front of our home computer and emailed to those dealers, telling them what type of car we want with the right options, and asking for a quote along with our one-price bid on it. You probably don't want to go if the dealer's price is too far from what you expected and don't have the right kind of cars in stock you're looking for, such as the right color, model, equipment etc. 

One or two days later, we began to collect the responses and phone calls one by one. After talking on the phone and emailing back and forth a couple of times, we've narrowed it down to several places. For some reasons, even the same car may be sold at quite different prices depending on the factors where the dealers are located and many many other causes. We're not good at negotiating a lot and don't like to have to talk too much in buying a car. We're trying to avoid being pushed by those well-prepared sale persons. Talking on the phone,in fact, is helping somehow to prevent us from being rushed into any decisions by the sale persons. 

With the trade-in price for our old car found from &lt;http://kbb.com/&gt; (Kelly Blue Book) and &lt;http://edmunds.com/&gt;, plus the invoice prices from Internet for each trim, along with the car finance loan checks we got from &lt;http://www.carfinance.com&gt;(We got 7.7% APR, which is just okay for the time with no promotion finance programs and my own credit history.), we went to test drive those cars.

It gave us the impression that Corrola is very good at a lot nice tiny things, also the engine. But it's a little light-weight. We skidded during the test drive unfortunately, even it's not a bad weather, not a sharp turn. It scared us away. Maybe it's because it's a new car. Then we test-drove the Honda Civic. It also has a lot of fancy things such as the remote control, keyless entry, plus from outside look, it looks to be a little bigger than Corrola, especially watching from behind. You could feel its body is more steady and heavier. But on the road, from the engine sound, it seems the Civic is kind of struggling every time when you try to speed up. The sale person told us that the manufacturer did it that way just trying to simulate the sport car for the young customers  ^|*,  while I think it may be due to the fact that its horse power (HP) is a little lower than that of the Corrola's.

They are all good cars, but we are not totally satisfied for our own stupid reasons. We used to drive the Mazda Proteges. It's much roomier. Then we talked to one of friends. He suggested us to take a look at Honda Accord or Toyota Camery. Maybe it only need a couple of thousands dollars more.  What we found was, the Camery is certainly nice. But the price is way too high for us. We didn't even spend too much time on it, just because of the window price listed. But, when we saw the Accord, we know approximately by adding a couple of thousand dollars more and making some bargains with the sales, we can probably get it.

After test drove it, it was a real fall in love a first sight. No kidding. The engine is so powerful (135 HP) comparing with Civic (106 HP). (And it is almost the same as the 4 cylinder Toyota Camery, which is 136 HP) You feel it so apparently when you set the pedals, so effortless and so quiet, not any noticeable noise! And the front window view is just so big and broad. You get good views back and forth without a lot of stretch and obstacles. Just such a pleasant driving experience. 

The Accord LX model also has adjustable seat height, which is really a nice and neat thing, especially for long trip drivers. By turning the two small plastic wheels besides the seat, you can easily choose the positions you feel comfortable with. The car is a lot roomier and a lot functions. The most important thing is, it gives more confidance and safety when one is driving on the highway and under other occasions.

For the price we paid $16,400, we also got the Appearance Package included, such as mud guards, floor mats, wheel locks etc.  By adding a couple of more thousand dollars, we got a lot extra things we need. The only sacrifice we made and also the reason we got this bargain is that it's a 1999 car. It's almost the end of the year. The dealers are trying to clear out their old inventories. Anyway, there is only 50 miles on the new toy.
