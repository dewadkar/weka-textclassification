            I had a 1998 Corolla and loved it!!!  Until I got in a wreck last month and totaled my car.  I decided I wanted something a little bigger and hopefully safer.  I am not knocking the Corolla for dependability, but the passenger side seatbelt and airbag didn't work right and my son hit his head on the windshield.  I was surprised at the difference in the way the 2000 Camry handles.  It drives and rides like a luxury car but gets great gas mileage and it's not to so big that you feel like your driving a Tank.  The price wasn't anywhere near what I thought it would be either I could actually afford this car.  I think Toyota did a great job designing this car.<br><br>
