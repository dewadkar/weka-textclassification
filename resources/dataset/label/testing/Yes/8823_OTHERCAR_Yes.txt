            I have a 2000 Accord SE with less than 1,500 miles on it, and it is living up to its reputation as a rock solid machine that never misses a beat.  For the price, it's well equipped--particularly in SE trim--and cruises quietly on the highway.  As a former BMW driver, the 4 cylinder Accord is a little tame.  Put your foot down at a light and there's a tug and slight hop from the front wheel, and the engine sounds a bit stressed out.  By the time you hit third gear, though, it's breathing normally again and ready to resume its customary duties.  

For the price, (just 20K) I was able to lease this car at a very reasonable price...much cheaper than a VW Jetta, which I compared. The SE version comes with standard alloy wheels, ABS brakes and keyless entry, which is almost a requirement these days.  The biggest downfall:  styling.  You could be lost out on the road in one of these Hondas and no one could ever find you.  It looks just like a Camry-Malibu-midsize something or other Hertz car. Can't Honda put their great drivetrains in combination with some distinctive sedan styling?  They did it on the Accord coupe, but the sedan looks like the box it came in.  

All in all, though, a very dependable car and a great value...even if you have to travel incognito.  <br><br>
