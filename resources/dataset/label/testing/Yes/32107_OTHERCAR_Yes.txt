            Life with a car can be a hellish experience.  Life without a car can be a hellish experience.  Hidden costs of operation of a car such as gas, parking, insurance, maintenance and the like can pile up on top of those already steep payments.  Most of the time, a car is a necessity, and the next level would be a luxury.
The 300M is a car in the necessity/luxury price range that has nothing but luxury comfort.  I can't believe that I would actually tell someone that a car is a wonderful thing- but this 300M really is.  It isn't a 'touring' sedan that cruises along and hogs up the road.  It has a powerful engine under the hood, and yet still gets good gas mileage - at lease much better than a 'destroy the universe' SUV.  The 300M comes loaded with everything-  Leather seats, power everything, aircon, great wheels, great colors, great to drive.  On and on and on. It is super-roomy, I'm 6ft4 and I'm comfortable in the front an the rear seats.
If you have to own a car, and be a hog of a consumer like myself, and you have some money to spend on it- then this is a car for you.
