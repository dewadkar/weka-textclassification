            Dear reader:


    The 1999 Nissan Altima is a very economical and stylish vehicle. I own one since Dec 99 and I must admit is a very comfortable and relatively quiet car. The interior has a nice fit and finish. The altima comes standard with many features like a CD, p/w window, door, brakes. The engine in this car provides decent power and acceleration. The engine a 2.4L inline four, delivers 150hp and 154lb of torque enough for daily driving. This engine is very reliable and economical. The four speed automatic transmission is very smooth. My favorite feature of this 2.4L engine is the liquid filled engine mounts wich provide a very smooth idle, unlike other inline four that suffer of vibrations during idling. The suspension is independent in four wheels using struts.A passive safety feature this vehicles has is called a rear supertoe suspension. This system under conering wheel adjust the rear wheels so the driver wheel have more control of the car during cornering. The front seats might be a little bit unsoportive, during long trips you may beging to feel a back pain. If you get one of this cars make sure the car comes with the Lumbar support. The fuel economy is about 28mpg. The rear seat is comfortable for two adults and one children. The trunk is very spacious, and safety features include, dual front airbags, antilock braking systems, and disc brakes on front drums on back(four wheels disc brakes on SE model)/There is a keyless entry system unfortuonaly it doesn't have a trunk funtion as well.
