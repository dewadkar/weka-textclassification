            I rented this car for a three-day trip to Las Vegas.  I wasn't disappointed, but I was surprised by a few things.  It's not as big as I expected. From what I've always heard, I expected the hugest car ever driven on land--it's not.  And I expected dead quiet with not even wind noise.  There is plenty of wind noise, and it's not as quiet as you'd always imagined a luxury car might be.  Plus, the air conditioner when turned up, is loud, and I was also surprised that when travelling through the 120 degree desert, the coolest the Towncar's loud air-conditioning will go down to is 60 degrees.

I couldn't believe that my four bags took up so much room in the Towncar's trunk.  In my little Corolla, my luggage can fit quite nicely actually, with room to spare.  Although the Towncar's trunk is deep, it doesn't go back as far as some other car's trunks.  The cup holders block the air-conditioning controls and these cup holders aren't deep enough to hold a tall 2L water bottle.  There could be more little storage places to hold things up front too.  And, I can't believe my 2000 Signature Series Towncar didn't come with a CD player, only cassette!

And yet, I'd rent this exact same car again, in a heartbeat.  Why?  It's such a classic.  The ride, although loud-for me, is very smooth.  And everything about the driving of this car is easy and hassle-free.  You don't even have to lock the doors, the car automatically locks the doors after you have  driven away.  The seats are comfortable and have a memory so you don't have to keep adjusting them.  The driver's seat leans back when you are ready to exit, making it easy to get into and out of this car.

I felt very safe and protected on the desert highway, going 90 miles per hour, with the high winds whipping around other less heavy cars; and, amazingly, I found that this car does have great handling around curves, almost like the suspension of a Honda.

The real reason that I'd rent this car, though, whenever I have a special occasion or treacherous long-distance travel anywhere, is because of the look.  The 2000 Lincoln Towncar has one of the most stylish, dignified, and elegant looks of any luxury car.  The car rental place tried to talk me into renting a Mercedes, but I said no way.  I think the Mercedes, nowadays, has a very &quot;common&quot; look that isn't as classically elegant and reminiscent of a more gracious time the way the Lincoln Towncar is. The Lincoln Towncar is the ultimate &quot;special occasion&quot; car. When you want to very glamourously drive up to the hotel car port in style, you ease the Towncar up the driveway, and you know you have arrived. --At least till you have to return the Towncar to the rental agency!   <br><br>
