            I received this little bundle of joy back in high school, and it is still going strong for me after 4 years.  I lovingly refer to this machine as my "lawnmower", because it lacks a wallop in the power department, but it gets where I need to go with absolutely no trouble.  Here's a glance at the specs:

2-door
31 MPG (city & highway combined)
1.5L, 4 cylinder engine
93 horsepower
Front-wheel drive
no anti-lock breaks

I have not had any maintenace problems thusfar with my Tercel.  And it's a tough little car, given that I've been in 2 accidents in it.  Both instances involved me getting rear-ended, the 1st by a 4Runner, and the 2nd time by a Ford F150.  I escaped both accidents unscathed, despite accumulating upwards of $10,000 in damage in both accidents.  This is a credit to the safety of the Tercel.  The car handles pretty well too, until you hit high speeds.  It has a tight turn radius, making U-turns very easy.  I definitely trust my Tercel's handling through adverse weather conditions, especially snow and ice.  It also has dual airbags, adding a sense of safety comfort.  The car has pretty good acceleration in the lower ranges.  It also provides a pretty smooth ride for the most part.  And for you environmentalists, it is one of the lowest pollutant-emitting vehicles on the market.  You can't go wrong with the 30  miles per gallon either.  And finally, it is one of the better-looking economy cars out there, with a bit of a sporty look.

One of the cons would have to be the amount of passenger room available.  Whoever has to ride in the backseat of my car usually suffers from having their legs squished against the front seats.  It would not be an ideal vehicle for family road-trips.  The lack of power is also a real concern, there have been times where my MPH gauge hovers around 45 while climbing a moderate hill, while I have the gas pedal mashed to the floor.  For this reason, I am unlikely to ever take my car up into the mountains (I live in Colorado).  This vehicle has trouble at high speeds as well.  When it hits about 85 MPH, it begins to shudder a bit, and you lose a sense of total control with the steering.  The interior isn't the most appealing, especially to a guy like myself.  And the lack of power windows can be annoying.  It becomes a bit of a hassle to reach across to the passenger-side window to roll it down.  And in very cold temperatures, the windows have a tendency to freeze shut.
