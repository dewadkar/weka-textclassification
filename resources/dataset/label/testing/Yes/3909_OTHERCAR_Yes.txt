            We replaced our 1999 Bravada with a 2001 Silhouette for the additional room and better gas mileage. We got the Premier edition so my daughter can be entertained while we are on long trips. We have all the options except the chrome wheels and gold package. 
I am not sure about the other drivers but I have not had any problems with blind spots, there are big mirrors easily adjusted (although I wish they had the automatic adjustment with the seat memory).

The entertainment package is great since it is out of the way for the in town trips but easily accessible for longer trips. Also we found the Apex MD 100 DVD player which is easily plugged into the existing system offering us the ability to use both our DVD and VHS collections.

The power doors are really handy although the Honda Odyssey has a better activation system with the door handles. But if you stick to using the buttons on the remote, door frame or the overhead console all is well. Although you can override the system entirely to avoid childrenï¿½s hands (this is a pain), it would be nicer to have the ability to just override the buttons on the door frame (with the child door lock switches). We have to watch and make sure our daughter doesn't use them. I am pretty sure the door would reverse (requires equal and opposite pressure to the closing) but it would probably still hurt.

At 6'4" I can get comfortable in the seats, the seat warmers work well but accidentally turning them on in the Texas heat was not too comfortable :-) Even the new back seats are comfortable enough for me to ride in.

We have the bench seat in the back which folds down "virtually" flat, good enough for most needs and if you really need to you can remove it. This also includes a handy organizer for grocery bags and other items.

The few options we had/have on the Bravada/Intrigue that I wish were in the van are the automatic A/C and the extra warning bells for low fuel, parking break etc. I would pay more for a Bose speaker system too, with the rear entertainment center you are essentially using a 2 speaker stereo for the front passengers and they are located in the doors. tweeters and additional dash mounted speakers would probably help.

If you are near Dallas go to Sewell to buy your cars, they are great and this is my 3rd automobile I have bought from them. No hassle, great deals and superior service.
