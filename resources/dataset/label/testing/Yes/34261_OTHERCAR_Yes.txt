            <b> Overview </b>

With the ever-growing compact import sedan market, there have been many new contenders over the last few years.  For 2002, the newest contender in this segment is the Jaguar X-Type.  It was designed and priced to compete with the Audi A4, BMW 3-series and many others that I will list later on.

When I was looking for a compact imported sedan, I looked at many choices and at many dealerships, and I decided to have a look at the Jaguar X-Type in addition to the BMW 3-series, Lexus IS 300 and Mercedes Benz C-Class.  Since Ford acquired Jaguar in the early 90�s, I have been interested in looking at Jaguars. The Jaguar dealer walked me through the process of getting the car and they seem to offer a generous welcome when we walk in the doorsteps in their dealerships.

<b> Performance </b>

What I noticed immediately is the similar performance that was delivered by the BMW and Lexus in the Jaguar X-Type.  I can feel the engine can really purr like a cat and it really lives up to the Jaguar name, judging by its performance factor.  With the All Wheel Drive, I can ensure that I�m safe, because of the traction distribution whenever necessary.  What I really wished it had was a Jaguar X-Type Rear Wheel Drive equivalent.  With Rear Wheel Drive, it may deliver slightly better performance in handling, particularly with emergency handling.  The X-Type offers a choice of Manual or Automatic (Automatic is no extra charge on the 3.0).  But with the automatic transmission, it does shift smoothly, but I still wished for a semi automatic shifting like the BMW 3-series� Steptronic, otherwise it�s know to be as Tiptronic.  If only the X-Type had a tiptronic transmission (manual shifting with the ease of automatic), it would attract greater sales than it would for now.

<b> Ambience, Comfort and Convenience </b>

When I first sank into the driver�s seat of the X-Type, I noticed that it had adequate support, especially for my sides.  I find the driver�s seat pretty supportive and it offers a range of movement by the provision of its standard electric driver�s seat.  With the optional Premium Package, they add an electric lumbar support for the driver�s seat as well.  The rear seat is also noticeably roomier than most of the X-Type�s contenders.  It isn�t as cramped or tight as in the IS 300 and the 3-series.  With the extra long body it helped Jaguar achieve the extra legroom for the rear seat and room for the trunk.  With a 16 cubic feet trunk, you can easily pack plenty of bags for a cross-country vacation.  It also offers an optional split folding rear seat for even more versatility to carry long cargo such as skis and snowboards.  Compared to the other contenders in its class, the X-Type�s extra room also can be a better contender.

With the cabin surroundings of generous bird�s eye maple and collony leather, the cabin offers a warm and inviting ambience compared to many of its contenders, including the Lincoln LS.

For the climate control, there isn�t a dual zone temperature control, which is rather disappointing for a $30,000+ import.  Other than that, the automatic climate control works very well to cool, even during hot summer days in Nevada.

<b> Conclusion </b>

In conclusion, the Jaguar X-Type is generally aimed at younger buyers and to attract women to buy a Jaguar.  With prices starting at $30,000 for the X-Type 2.5 Standard, it�s equipped with Collony Leather, Birds Eye Maple, All the power goodies, Electric Driver�s Seat, AWD and many more.  Prices for the 3.0 start at $36,000 with either Manual or no charge Automatic.  But when you add your X-Type with options, the price climbs quickly.
