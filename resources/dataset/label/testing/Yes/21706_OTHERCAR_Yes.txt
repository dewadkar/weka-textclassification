            I fancy myself an informed member of society. So before I went out and bought a new vehicle, I did a lot of research on cars and light trucks. I wanted a truck because of the utility available to haul payloads, (I used it to move me and my girlfriend 450 miles shortly after I bought it) and I was impressed with Nissan's track record as far as repairs and service values go. I had it only for the first thirty thousand miles, and the only thing that went wrong was a blown fuse in the air conditioner.
What I didn't like about it was the fact that the dealer said it had a four speaker sound system, but I found out that meant a separate tweeter and mid-range speaker in the front of the doors. (No speakers in the back of the extended cab, as they put in the '97s.) The jumper seats aren't terribly comfortable either, but hey- they're fold down jumper seats... come on.<br><br>
