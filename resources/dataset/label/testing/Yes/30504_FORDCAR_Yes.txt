            We live on a small farm and needed a truck to haul feed and livestock. Since our children are now teens we knew that the extended cab was ready to be upgraded to a full crew cab. The full crew cab gives plenty of room for up to six people. 

This pickup handles all of our family's needs.  It is a workhorse for the farm and a pleasure to drive, and ride in, as a &quot;family car&quot;. The 4 wheel drive is great when it comes time to get hay out of the field, or when off road.  

The power stroke diesel gives all the power you could want when passing on the highway, even when hauling or pulling a load. 

The new &quot;scalloped&quot; front driver and passenger windows are really a great help for seeing small cars beside you. 

This is a great vehicle for people that need to haul and have a family. Because of the relatively low gas mileage I would not recommend it for total pleasure use or for singles or couples. Although the diesel engine gets better mileage than a gas engine.<br><br>
