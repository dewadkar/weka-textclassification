            The 2000 Pontiac Firebird is an awesome car inside an out. It's sleek lines and curves receive constant complements. The 3800 V6 [200 horsepower] engine that comes in the base model is surprisingly powerful and quick. It runs smooth and quiet while at idle and growls under acceleration. Fuel consumption is moderate at 19 to 21 MPG in the city and 29 to 31 MPG on the highway. Visibility is good, if the mirrors are properly adjusted there are no blind spots. The long sloping front end can be difficult to judge when parking. The four wheel anti-lock disc brakes work extremely well, even at high speeds. The cockpit like interior is comfortable and manageable with ample leg room front and rear. All gages are easily seen and readable. Headlight,turn signal and windshield wiper switches are also easily accessible. The monsoon sound system lets a'lot to be desired. The equalizer is sensitive and needs constant adjustment. If your looking for a car with style and performance at an affordable price, this is it.
