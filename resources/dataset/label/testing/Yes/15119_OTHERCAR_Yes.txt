            I have owned many cars in a short time and I am sticking the the Altima.  I have three kids ages ranging from 2-6 and the Altima has enough room for two car seats and a third kid to ride comfortably in the back seat.  I am not a mini-van person so finding a car that looks good, rides good and that is as dependable as the Altima was a big sigh of relief.  The only down fall is that the controls on the inside are not very fancy, but when you have a family certain things are more important.  Great trunk space.<br><br>
