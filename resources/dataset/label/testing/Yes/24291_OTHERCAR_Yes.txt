            As the former owner of a '95 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I'll never buy another Sport Utility Vehicle.

I was highly impressed by my Jeep.  I felt like I was driving a powerful and commanding vehicle.  I put the optional 4 x 4 front bumper on the Jeep, which gave it an imposing look.  I felt as if I had a good command of the traffic when I was on a highway.

I bought the Jeep because of its solid reputation as a good SUV and because I liked how it looked.  I was certainly not disappointed.  

The interior of the Jeep was comfortable.  I had the Laredo, but with the leather seating package.  I am large, yet there was ample room to sit comfortably in the driver's seat.  Large people will have no problem fitting in the front or the back seats.  There is plenty of room in the cargo area to store luggage, etc.  For extra-large items, the back seats collapse very easily.

In terms of repairs, I felt that the Jeep had more than its share.  I had to replace the brakes twice in a short period of time, the emergency brake needed to be replaced, and one of the windows wouldn't open due to an electrical problem that no mechanic was able to fix, despite several attempts.

My Jeep was on a lease, and I was upset to return it.  My next vehicle will certainly be another Jeep.<br><br>
