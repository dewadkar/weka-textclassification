            Synopsis:  

We have had this 94 Grand Cherokee Laredo since new.  Overall, it is a great vehicle with a few minor design and manufacturing flaws that are easily made up for by the low cost of ownership and the great drivetrain.  

Specs:  

4.0L inline 6-cyl engine, Quadra-Trac (full-time 4WD), Laredo package (power everything, cloth interior, 6-spkr Infinity Gold stereo/cassette), Michelin XW4 tires.

Design/Practicality:  

It�s not as space-efficient as an Explorer, primarily because the spare is in the rear cargo area; however, the drivetrain is remarkable and bulletproof.  Variations have been used for almost 15 years and they�ve been durable and easy to service.  The interior layout is typical for an American vehicle of the early 90�s � lots of gray/black plastic and big knobs; however, it�s aged well and looks far better than the weird bulges and exaggerated curves in GM vehicles.  

I�ve been really happy with the Infinity Gold stereo.  It keeps up with the newer up-to-date ones pretty well � the sound is clear and neutral, the tape deck and separate amplifier have been problem free, and speaker placement (with the separate tweeters and woofers up front) create a great soundstage; it took other manufactures until very recently to put that kind of energy into their stereos.  

The rear seats are very easy to fold and the cargo area is generous for 2 people and merely ok for 4-5.  My girlfriend and I put in a week�s worth of camping gear, 2 mountain bikes, and a ton of odds-and-ends and we�re fine.  Likewise, it�s long enough with the seats down that we can fit almost any table-top or the like at Ikea.  

Driveability:  

I think it handles better than any other truck-based SUV than the Pathfinder, whose engineers REALLY know how to massage a suspension.  I�m particularly impressed because the Grand Cherokee has solid axles rather than an independent suspension � those solid axles keep your ground clearance consistent over uneven terrain.  We�ve been able to clear trails that have left other SUV�s stuck.  It�s decent in the city and easy to park/maneuver, but it's a degree noiser than the more modern Japanese V6's and the fuel economy in heavy urban traffic is bad � anywhere between 10-15MPG.  However, I�ve noticed that with synthetic oil I�m consistently getting 25MPG on the highway.  As a side note, I highly recommend Mobil Delvac 1 for older engines.  It�s marketed towards diesel trucks but is ideal for older engines in general � it�s like Mobil 1 with even more detergents and wear control. 

Quality/Maintenance:  

It�s been very durable and things haven�t broken.  The undercarriage has a tendency to squeak once in a while, especially in winter, and it had a couple of early electrical problems (none debilitating); I suspect these are the things that don�t happen as much in Pathfinder or Trooper.  Maintenance, however, is much cheaper.  I use synthetic oil, but am able to easily go 5000 miles between changes.  Around 70K-80K miles, the transfer case sometimes needs to be serviced.  I think I�ve got another 10K miles or so according to the dealer who said �it�s looks a bit dirty, but you�ve got another year or so.�  The case service is not cheap ($700), but then it�s good to go for another 70-80K miles and it�s pretty much the only servicing you need to do for the Quadra-Trac.  In the summer, you�ll need to add a quart of oil between changes, but that�s pretty typical for this kind of engine.  The 4.0L engine itself has a legendary reputation for durability � I have friends that have them in their late-80�s Cherokee�s and they�re still humming along without a problem.  I have heard about general quality problems with the Grand Cherokee, but I suspect there was a bad batch or two.  I�ve heard far more stories like mine � mechanically sound with a couple initial electric problems and occasional odd squeak.  

Buying a used-one?  

Pay an experienced mechanic who knows SUV�s the money to go over it with a fine tooth comb and make sure you see all the service records.  If it checks out, you�ll end up with a great vehicle that should last well up to 200K miles.  <br><br>
