            I really like the Jeep Cherokee Sport we leased. You feel like your in a tank. Snow is no problem, but watch out if you're short in stature.

First the good things. The Cherokee was made for off-roading. It does not adjust to 4 wheel drive automatically. You have to select which drive you want to put it in. But that's a small problem when you think about all the snow we had here in NY this past winter. The Cherokee handled really well. My Honda couldn't get up the driveway at times, but the Cherokee had no problems.

The interior is not that nice. It is pretty sparse in terms of amenities. My Honda V6 EX is really nice in that regard. However, my brother leased this Jeep with the CD and Tape player for only 5 more dollars a month. That was a pretty good deal I thought. The biggest problems I have is that I am only 5 foot 1, and sometimes getting into the Jeep and adjusting the seat can be a problem. I really have to hike myself up at times. Then when I'm in, I have to pull the seat way up which is not the most comfortable position to be in.  For my brother, who is the main driver of the vehicle, it is no problem. 

I think it is a great deal. After our 3 year lease, we are seriously thinking into buying out the vehicle since the residual will only be 13,000. If you live in Putnam County or Southern Dutchess County, NY, Smith-Cairns in Brewster gave us great service.
