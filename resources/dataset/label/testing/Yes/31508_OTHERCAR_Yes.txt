            The 200 Nissan Sentra GXE is a nice bang for your buck.  The GXE with the limited edition package gives you several nice amenities for a price of around $16,000.  The package gives you keyless entry, AM/FM/CD stereo, sport bucket seats, alloy wheels, door ajar warning light, body colored door handles, mirror and body side molding, and tachometer to go along with the power locks and windows, A/C, cruise, and power mirrors that come with the standard GXE package.  

The Sentra will seat 4 comfortably and has a roomy trunk.  The keyless entry is nice to have, but it really needs to have a button for the trunk.  Acceleration is fair with the 1.6L 4-cylinder engine and an automatic transmission.  The 5-speed manual will give you better acceleration.  For more horsepower, you can move up to the Sentra SE with the 2.0L 140hp engine for only a few dollars more.  The 1.6L engine is not too noisy but it will zip along.  The Sentra hugs the corners well with the 175/65R14 tires and braking is adequate with the front disc/rear drum brakes.  

You may not get as many of the amenities with the Sentra that you will with an Altima or Maxima, but you will get a nice family car that has some spunk to get you around yet tote the family at the same time.<br><br>
