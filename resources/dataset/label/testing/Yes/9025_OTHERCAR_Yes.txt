            We, I, purchased this Kia for our daughter's, Ko, 21st birthday on the Internet from carorder.com.  The price was $6,000.00 less than the local dealership.

I think it's a practical car for people that travel, i.e., camping, skiing, birding...etc.  I also feel that it's a wonderful FAMILY car for young people.  I got to sit in the passenger seat.... Have not driven it nor rode in it.  Ko states that it handles smoothly on turns, excellent gas mileage and excellent safety features and structure.  She really likes the way the vehicle brakes in traffic.  

Ko asked for the basic 2000 Kia Sportage Sport Utility Vehicle (5 Dr).  She also ordered the following Optional Parts;
Air Conditioning
AM-FM Stereo w/ CS Player
Roof Rack
Remote Keyless Entry
Sun roof
5 Carpeted floor Mats
Driver &amp; Passenger Airbags
Removable roof rails
Surround Sound System
