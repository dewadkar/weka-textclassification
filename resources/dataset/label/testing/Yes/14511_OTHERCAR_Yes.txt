            I admit it. I know next to <i>nada</i> about cars in general. In fact, I consider it an achievement that I can check my oil and levels on my battery, transmission, and windshield washer fluid. Still, that doesn't mean that I can't love my RAV4, and I am not without opinion on it. 

The one technical thing I do know for certain is that &quot;RAV4&quot; stands for &quot;Recreational Active Vehicle with 4WD&quot; (though mine happens to be only a front-wheel drive). I, for one, did not choose this vehicle. When I was still in high school, my parents chose a car for me on the condition that I receive no other gift from them for my graduation and possibly for any following birthdays I may have for the rest of my life. :) I remember my father praising its city mileage, yada yada, and my mother talking of how, since this small SUV is elevated, it would be safer than other cars. I, for one, liked the color. :)

To get more serious here, my '97 standard is still running strong. Sure, it was relatively pricey (not that I cared so much at the time with the prospect of losing future b-day presents), but it has lasted me a long time and with only minor maintenance and absolutely no major problems at all. The ride quality is great, a fact that I can attest to after driving my father's clunkier stick shift for a model I shall not repeat here, and my leather interior remains in wonderful condition. There's a certain durability to this car that I really appreciate, and is a testament to the fact that I don't wreak chaos upon every automobile I come in contact with, despite popular opinion.

On the downside, there is a certain disadvantage for people who are not short-legged like me, and I've heard more than one complaint from vocal peers on how cramped it can get in the back seat, though my other friend, who owns a similar looking Honda CR-V, claims that my car is more roomier. Another problem occurs with how narrow the back door entry is, which should be a consideration for larger passengers. The headroom, though, is more than sufficient.

Overall, though, the four-door model I have seems convenient enough to cart people around for pretty lengthy distances (I can attest to this after having taken two 6-hour long drives in the back seat with a friend driving). The engine can be noisy compared to other cars, but with my ignorance of such details I just say, &quot;Turn up the radio, then!&quot;

The seats, both front and back, are wonderfully comfortable, though it is a bit hard to turn down the back seats. Instead of a lever on the side like other cars, this one has a kind of tag that you pull, and that can be quite stubborn at times. 

It's great for the everyday commuter. It accelerates quickly,driving it is really easy, and it handles very well with turns (though, as with all SUVs, it is best to take care rounding sharp curves). It also handles well in all the weather I've experienced. 

I have large cargo space and the trunk opens to the side. Both of these facts not only has made it easy to cart along large pieces of furniture up to college, but made my trunk a favorite hang-out during the good ol' days of lunchtime back in high school. For campers, fishers, and, I suppose in this case, high school students, this is a great car to just hang out in, sit in the trunk with the door swung open, and enjoy some fresh air.

The one accident I've had in it, a hit-and-run a couple of years ago when someone ran into my bumper and subsequently drove off before I could react, left a dent in the bumper that was hammered out to a better looking condition. The bumpers aren't metal like other cars, and it appears to me that mishaps like that don't show up as obviously on the RAV as they do on other cars. 

I have steel siding on the driver's and passenger's side on my car, another bonus in the case of accidents. I haven't been in a major accident with this car, thank goodness, so I can't say how well it would fare or how safe it really is. I looked up the NHTSA Crash Test for the RAV4 4-door wagon and in the crash test for front impact and passenger, the chance of serious injury came to about 10-20% or less, relatively very good. My version also has front and passenger air bags, another great security bonus.

As for service, Toyota has always been very good to me, and I haven't had a problem finding them wherever I go. With the stick, I find it very gas-efficient, a plus with today's rising prices. The console is also very clear to see, and my adjustable steering wheel is great. Overall, I have to say that it was worth missing b-day presents.<br><br>
