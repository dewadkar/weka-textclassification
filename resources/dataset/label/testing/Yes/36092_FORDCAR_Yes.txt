            This is my second review of the 2000 Ford Focus. I have had my ZX3 for almost nine months now, and my original impressions have survived intact. I have had no problems with the car yet (knock wood) and now that the engine is thoroughly broken in, performance has noticeably improved.

My wife was indifferent to my ZX3 at best, and a bit put off by the styling at worst. That changed when she drove it. Each time she drove the car, she liked it a little more.

We were planning on waiting until summer 2001 to buy her a car, but she test drove a Focus SE sedan with the same 2.0L Zetec engine as the ZX3 and decided she didn't want to wait anymore. So, six months after bringing my ZX3 home, we were a two Focus family.

The SE is stunning to look at in &quot;Autumn Orange&quot; with alloy wheels and decklid spoiler.

The sedan doesn't feel quite as light on its feet as the smaller ZX3, but it's not far off. It handles solidly and exhibits a lot of the same characteristics the ZX3 has in hard cornering: mild body roll, great feedback through the steering wheel and a distinct lack of understeer.

Being a four-door, the SE's B-pillar is farther forward than in the ZX3 and it interferes with my vision out the side as it is even with my shoulder. My wife doesn't have this problem though, (I'm 6'4&quot; she's 5'4&quot;), so it's not a big deal for us

My only other complaint about the car is that the center armrest interferes with shifting. I have to reach over the armrest and bend my wrist down to grab the shifter, and it feels awkward. Again, my wife's seating position is farther forward and she doesn't have the problem.

The cruise control is good. It drops a couple of miles per hour when first set but makes it easy to correct. The cruise will adjust one mile per hour up or down with each click of the accelerate or coast buttons respectively. This is a feature I expect to see on higher priced cars, not a $15,000 compact.

The overall ride is much quieter, smoother and more comfortable than you would expect in this price range. The SE's seats don't have the sporty bolstering found in the ZX3 but are firm and supportive. Some people complain about the crank-handle height adjustment, but you'll appreciate it if you and your spouse are separated by 12 inches of height.

On that subject, the tilt-telescoping wheel is a must have. I was lucky that the ZX3's wheel is in a perfect position for me, because I didn't get that option. This is a cool feature though.

Aside from two minor complaints, which are simply ergonomic differences depending on the size of the driver, the SE sedan is the typical Focus driving  experience, which is to say, excellent.<br><br>
