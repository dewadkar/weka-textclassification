            I bought this product about 1 1/2 years ago and have enjoyed it every since.  This camera is easy to operate, easy to maintain and easy to afford!  When I bought the camera, it was just over $400, but I believe the price has drastically come down since its release. I have used the camera to take pictures of friends and family, and my latest project is posting the pictures on the web for them all to see.  To upload the pictures to a computer is very easy.  You just turn the knob to connect, plug in the data cord to the camera and to the computer and just start clicking on the pictures on the screen.

This camera is very good for someone who doesnt need a zoom. However, I hope in the next year or so to move up to the next model that does have a zoom.

I would also recommend that if you purchase any of these cameras, you also purchase a good set of rechargable batteries.  These cameras go through batteries really fast! <br><br>
