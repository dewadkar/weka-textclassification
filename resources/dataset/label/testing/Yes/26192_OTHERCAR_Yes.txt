            We have the 2000 GLS 4 wagon, not even the V6, and we're really happy with it. Our model has the leather package, the 5-speed automatic Tiptronic, the cold weather package, and the Monsoon 6 CD stereo. It's silver with black leather.

We finally narrowed our choice down between this car and the Audi wagon. I didn't like the interior design of the Audi, I found the dash placement to be bulky, I felt it interfered with visibility, and there was definitely less interior room than the VW.

I also liked the snappiness of the turbo engine on the VW. We had wanted a V6, but the VW wagon is a hard car to find, in general, and I liked the way it felt even with the 4 cylinder. Ours has the Tiptronic, which I admit I never use, even though I was raised on a stick in Europe. (Ah, we had an early 4 speed Golf GTI that really kicked butt, oh, well...)

Since we live in Los Angeles, I'm very happy with the 5 speed automatic.

A year later, I like the car even more than when we first got it. I'm always pleasantly surprised when I step on it, and the turbo zips me through traffic, and forget that I am driving a wagon. It is a very solid car, and does consistent high speed highway driving with ease, quietly and efficiently.

Gas mileage has been pretty good, and the on board computer lets you know how many miles you have left. When the tank goes into the empty range, the car beeps to remind you to get gas, which you can ignore out of perversity, knowing it has a big reserve. We have not had to do anything other than an oil change service, which came free.

The interior is really dreamy. I can't imagine not having the leather, though. If you are going to spend this much on a car, you have to get the leather. The dash is easy to read, I love the signature VW blue and red lighted dash. The air-conditioning is super powerful. The stereo system, the Monsoon 6 CD one that came with it is excellent, although I personally dislike having the CD changer in the trunk.

The heated seats are totally not necessary here in L.A., but as I said, we took the car as it came, it was the only one available. I would much rather have had the automatic seat adjustment. Since we are 2 to drive the car, and since I am picky about how I like the seat, the manual is a pain.

Still, it's a minor complaint, over-all. While I am nitpicking, I am not 100% happy with the rear-view mirror, it's a little small for my taste.
I also don't like the cup-holder, I think it's a lame design, especially if both front seaters have a Starbucks. We smoke, but don't use the ashtray.
Also, you have to get used to the door-unlock system when you want to open the back doors or trunk.

The seats are very supportive, and it is a very comfortable car to drive. It is also a wonderful car to be a passenger in, there is a lot of room. The interior is really big, both in leg room and general space, with great visibility as a passenger.

It's a lovely car, pretty stylish, over-all. I love the way it drives in the city, which is where I do the majority of my driving, and it's easy to park.

Since a car is such a major purchase, it's really nice to have one which makes you happy each time you use it, and one that you like more and more over time. I'm glad we didn't get the Audi. We have one under the hood, anyway...<br><br>
