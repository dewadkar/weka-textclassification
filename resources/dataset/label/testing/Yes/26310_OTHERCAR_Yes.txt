            about a year ago i bought a 99 civic si. i had gotten it used, but it was only about half a year old. when i bought it i was told to run the rpms high, and boy was he right. this is a car that you want to drive fast! i have had zero problems with it and i've added almost 20k miles on it. they are also easy to fix up for all the car buffs out there. i get decent gas milage, but hey, its duel overhead cam! also, you have to use premium gas, nothing else will run this car properly. if you want a cheaper car with quick speed to get you through that nasty city traffic, check out the honda civic si. i could not be happier with my purchase.<br><br>
