            I bought my Tahoe for suburban homeowner trips to the lawn and garden center, for weekend getaways with the wife, to carry my bicycles to rides and races, for business sales calls and trips, for transporting heavy objects that my company sells and I am sometimes compelled to deliver to our customers, and for toting around our 3 grandchildren.  The Tahoe performs great at all these tasks.

I have the LS model, but I did get the leather seats with electric option.  Mine is black on the outside with light gray leather interior and two tone light gray/dark dray dash and door panels.  It looks great.  My partner has a GMC Denali that he paid $15,000 more than I paid for my Tahoe and I can't see very much difference in the two trucks for that much money.

I bought mine late last year and have 30,000 miles on it already.  I drive a lot.  The only complaints I have had thus far are (1) the tires don't tend to wear evenly, and (2) the CD player does not work very well.  I've had similar experiences with CD players on other GM products, so I think they may have a quality issue there.

As for the tires, I have found that you really do have to rotate them every 10,000 miles or so to keep them from wearing unevenly and starting to "howl" as I go down the road.  I think the owner's manual recommends rotating them every 15,000 miles, but I think on this vehicle more often is a good idea.

As I said earlier, I have past experience with GM vehicles and the Tahoe feels familiar to me and drives in a predictable and controlled manner.  I have found it to be easy to maneuver in traffic and parking lots.  The turning radius is great which helps around town.  On the highway, the seats are supportive and comfortable for long trips.

I purchased the liftgate model instead of the split rear doors.  I am pleased with this decision.  The door opens high so I don't have to worry about bumping my head (I'm 6 feet tall).  Also there's no tailgate in the way to reach over.

With the rear seats folded down, there's tons of room for carrying things.  For business purposes I have loaded my Tahoe with over 1500 pounds of merchandise with no ill effects.

Towing is also a very favorable experience as the Tahoe's capabilities in this area are above average.

I guess I should also say that I like the looks of the Tahoe.  I think it has a prestigious appearance yet it looks sporty and practical.  It is a great combination vehicle for the homeowner and small businessman.  I also carry bicycles on top of mine and they really look good sitting up there.

One last thing, I bought mine last year and I didn't know at the time that there was going to be a huge tax deduction available for this type and size of vehicle.  It sure makes the gas bill easier to pay knowing that my Tahoe is affording me over $20,000 in tax writeoffs.
