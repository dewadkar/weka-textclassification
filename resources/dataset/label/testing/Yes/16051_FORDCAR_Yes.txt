            I have a 1990 Ford Escort LX.  I bought it used six years ago when it had only 52,000 miles on it.  It is probably one of the ugliest body styles Ford has ever made, but it is probably one of the most reliable cars I have experienced.  Currently, it has 179,000 miles on it and it STILL starts on the first hit 95% of the time.  The AC is ice cold so summer heat has not been a problem.  It is very easy to work on.  All I have done is change the oil, timing belt, spark plug wires, and the brake pads.  It is kept clean always, but it still is unattractive.  The only annoying problem besides the car being annoyingly slow is the strange shudder that the transmission is making when I hit the gas fast. The handling is terrible, but if I want to go over a long distance I do not have to worry if the car is going to make it or not.  I am just waiting for this car to just stop one day either from extreme mileage for an American car of this time period or if it ever wrecked.  I have a new car now anyway but I just use this one to keep the mileage of off the new car.
