            I have driven all brands of SUV's from the explorer, to the 4runner, to the blazer, and I'm telling you the Isuzu Trooper is the best bang for the buck.  The vehicle is perfect for every occasion.  If you want to take it off road, it can handle any trenches, ditches, or mud patches with ease.  And it has a classy, elegant, timeless appeal to it which bodes well with the urban crowd.  And it's one of the only SUV's around that offer a standard model, not just the automatic.  This car is great for, but not limited to, the young driver (age 18-30).  It is great for the single person on the go, or the young family.  If you are seriously interested in buying a Trooper, do what I did.  Wait until December/January, when the new year's models are arriving, and by the older model.  This saved me a few thousand dollars.  Also, I'm a very tall guy and other SUV's are too tight of a ride for me.  The Isuzu is very comfortable for people of all sizes.  It's not the smoothest ride around.  I won't lie to you, you won't fall asleep driving it, but you will enjoy its power and handling.  Definitely a very fun, dependable car.<br><br>
