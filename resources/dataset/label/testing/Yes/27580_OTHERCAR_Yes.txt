            Best car I ever owned. I bought a 96 Geo Metro new when I was commuting about 1000 miles per week. Just sold it as a trade in on a minivan because my kids are getting too big for the Metro. This was a 4 door sedan with A/C and automatic transmission.
What I love: incredible reliability - over 78,000 miles with no breakdowns of any kind; comfortable (front only) - I'm 220 lbs and 6' 2&quot; tall, and fit easily; easy to maintain; good gas mileage - 25 mpg city/34 mpg highway routinely; ride and handling are easy and comfortable, front wheel drive provides good traction even on slippery roads; easy to park in tiny spaces.
What I hate: Limitations inherent in such a tiny car: limited leg room in back seat; weak, but acceptable, acceleration; narrow tires provide adequate traction, but wear quickly for such a light car; small trunk; no towing ability; my wife was worried about crash worthiness.
What's it like to drive: It doesn't feel as small as it really is. Nimble, keeps up with traffic easily, definitely not a roadster, top practical speed is about 75 mph, starts to shake after that. Not as quiet or smooth as a Lexus, but not bad.
Who should buy? This is THE car for people who want cheap basic transportation in a small package. One tip: you MUST change oil every 3000 miles. It has a small engine with a 3 speed automatic transmission and revs very high. A friend trashed his engine in only 32,000 miles by not changing oil regularly. I used 100% synthetic every 3000 miles and had no problems and burned no oil.<br><br>
