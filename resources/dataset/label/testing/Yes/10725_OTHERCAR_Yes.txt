            The car I have is the 93 Vector (Black with sand leather interior), and it's a six-speed manual transmission; I have had this car since late July of 2003 and it's just too much fun to drive.  

True that it's not the same as a sporty rear-wheel drive, but it's close enough to emulate rear wheel cornering and yet have the front wheel stability in snow and rain.

The overall combination of its aesthetics, driving comfort, handling and features makes this an absolute winner.  

The 17 inch wheels with Pirellis are wonderful, and the ride of the car overall is smooth as butter.  One just seems to glide along quietly and when the need arises you can handle bumps and curves in a very tight and sporty fashion.

I don't think there is any car out there that matches the interior and exterior design of this car.  BMW and Audi have pretty much messed up their beauty of days gone by with very non-descript and overly squarish looks and tacky glimmering wood trim that is better suited for a Bentley or Rolls Royce.  The Saab Vector 93 offers a wonderful and less tacky interior with simple vinyl/plastic and brushed metallic interior combinations.  The sand leather seats have a nice touch of black leather strips to match the exterior color.

All the buttons and features are ergonomically designed and provide mostly useful information.  The cabin has ample room for four adults and a large trunk space.

The new improvements in the turbo make it even better because you get enough speed and horsepower to have fun without being a gas guzzler.  A full tank gives 400-500 miles easily at highway speeds.
