               The new Beetle is really just a clever marketing strategy from volkswagon, yet it caused a sensation when it was launched in 1998. This car was dubbed " a lifestyles car", It has retro style looks on a golf platform.

                    A name is about all the new beetle has in common with the old one. Its modern,front mounted,watercooled engine, is smooth and quiet, and the handling is predictable with excellent front and rear weight distribution. The power of the 2.0 16 valve 4cylinder engine, although not a racer, offers acceleration the old beetle could only dream of. At crusing speeds the new beetle is also quiet and for the most part "refined". The Automatic tranmission is also refined, although making this bug even slower than if it was teamed with the 5 speed standard Manual tranny.

        The Interior is spacious and light. Inside the new beetle has retro styling, but also all the creature comforts one would expect from a modern car costing nearly $17,000. The Seats are very supportive, the steering wheel is nice and grippy. The new Beetles interrior is more like a Lexus Ls400 than it is like the old beetle. 

   The Exterior is self explanatory, its very cute, very appealing to anyone weather they care to admit it or not. This car, specially among men, has become shameful to like.. we all just need to accept it, WE like this car, we like the way it looks, we like everything about it. There is nothing to be ashamed of people.
