            We were expecting our first child, and my family all lives in the mid-west, and I live in Oregon.  Family is important to me, and I wanted to leverage the world wide web to keep my family up to date on Olivia Paige's growth.

I talked my wife into getting a digital camera.  I did a tremendous amount of research on digital cameras in our price range and with 3+ megapixels.  We wanted a camera that was not super high resolution (and the price tag that went with it), but was sufficient enough to allow us to print out high quality pictures.

After reviewing consumer reports, this epinions site, and talking with other owners of a digital camera, I settled on the Olympus C-3020.  I bought our camera from eBay (you may consider this a good or bad thing).  It was brand new, in the factory box and wrapping.  It had all the peripherals and the US factory warranty.  I paid $300.00 USD.

After getting the camera, I learned that all the great things people said about it were true.  Great Value.

Straight forward.  Pictures turn out great.  Easy to use.  Takes up to 35 seconds of video (plays out on Quicktime).  Video files are HUGE, but fun.  Only wish the video captured voice as well.

I am not a super techno guy, nor am I a wanna be professional photographer, but I do have to say that the openning and closing of the lense is a little pain.  #1, it is slow, and #2, if the lense cap is on when you turn on the camera, there are bad sounds and beeping.

We have had our camera 6 months, and love it.

You will have to upgrade the memory card it comes with.  The 16MB standard is not enough.   

Also, last summer, I accidently spilled water on it.....  Turns out it is a resilient little guy.  Wiped it off, and no issues.

Must buy rechargable batteries.  Sucks power.
