            I've always wanted a digital camera and have received an opportunity to purchase one for my birthday over a year ago.  Having gone to the store and examined all of their display items, the Sony Cyber Shot DSC-P9 stood out.
It has the more modern shape that most other companies like HP and Kodak don't use as in they stick to the traditional square look.  It's sleek and not grossly built with option upon option sticking out of it.  The power comes through in every picture as well as its very strong flash.

Having had the DSC-P9 for over a year, I had the opportunity to use it to its full extent.  On vacations, weddings, school reports, personal use, this camera can do it all.  Especially with its 4MP and 3x optical zoom, the photo clarity is superb.  The images are just as life like as can be.

With the 5 levels of graphics, I can take photographs in black & white, Solaris, Sofia, negative, and normal (of course).  I went to a wedding about a year ago.  With the camera in Sofia mode, I was able to take a photo with the old time look to it (brown tinted.)The quality was impressive.  The newly weds have since printed out the photo and framed it.

On vacation to Europe a few months ago, the camera came in very handy.  I was able to take film footage of chiming church bells and the like in pretty good quality and show it on the TV to my grandparents.  And with 128MB card, over 120 photos at 1600x1200 resolutions were taken.

More Specifically with 128MB card at:
2272x1704 64 photos
2272 in 3:2 64 photos
1600x1200 130 photos
1280x960 197 photos
640x480 770 photos

In MPEG with the 128MB card
160x112 91min 28sec
320x240 23min 38sec
320(HQX) 5min 54sec

Close ups are excellent too.  Having gone to formal gardens, taking a close up of a rose in full bloom revealed every riveted bead of dew on the petals.  

Taking photos at night, please, it's as if sunlight was implanted into the flash.  As a test, I went into a pitch black room, taking a photo with the flash lit every object in the room, including another person, without red eye.  Of course taking photographs outside is a different matter with regard to the flash, its effective range is somewhere between 10-20 feet, after that, it gets a little hazy.  Still, the camera can effectively photograph someone in the foreground and a landmark in the back ground.... at night or day.

Would I recommend this camera...? YES!! I would.  Its superb performance along with its durability has made it the best purchase I've ever made with regard to Digital Cameras.  I also recommend getting a camera case for it and also the 128MB (or larger) memory card as a 16MB card comes along.
