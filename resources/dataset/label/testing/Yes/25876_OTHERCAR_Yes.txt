            I have owned my Cherokee for almost eight years and I have nothing but praise for its durability while serving under extreme conditions. This vehicle is perfect for any kind of road trip you can imagine. Although I don't consider myself a &quot;four-wheeler&quot;, who chooses to go mud bogging and  mountain climbing on a regular basis, my Jeep has pulled me out of some tough jams on fishing and hiking trips. One time I had to cross a river that was so high the water came up to driver's side window. I don't know the mechanics of the vehicle well enough to explain how I made it across, all I know is that I never loss traction and the engine never died, even while partially submersed. Experiences like this sold me on the engineering and quality of the vehicle and to be perfectly honest I will always keep at least one Jeep in my garage. Just in case a flood occurs, of course. <br>
