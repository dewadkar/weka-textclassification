            I have a bright blue 99 beetle GLS and every second of owning this car has been a dream.... almost.  It has the highest ceilings of any other  compact car i have been in, and a body style that always gets noticed.  It has great gas mileage, and quite a lot of pick up on the highway.  The only problem I had with my car is... when i first got it December 98, it needed a new transmission immediately.. i guess i got a lemon.  I think that compared to most cars it has a pretty big blind spot.. or blind spotS, and the trunk opens only whenn it feels like opening.  The key is pretty cool, a keyless entry and key in one.. BUT both of my keys have broken and are now held together with clear tape.  Pretty snazzy huh? Anyway.. besides what i have mentioned, the comfy seats, the huge cabin and the looks make up for everything a thousand times over.  I love my car... then again, i also love my 70 VW beetle with no heat :).  All i can say is that everyone who has been in my car loves it, and i think that most people will love it.. especially &quot;VW fanatics&quot;. I couldn't possibly be happier.<br><br>
