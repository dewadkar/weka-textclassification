            Let's see, where should I start.  This has been a pretty good first car for me.  I'm 18 and I've had the car for about 14 months.  I do accelerate quickly sometimes but I don't drive crazy.  The car drives great from my experience in the snow and wet weather as long as you don't expect the car to have the all weather tires be anything more than that.  The ability to downshift in the snow with the manual transmission is a great benefit  The car has decent power for merges onto interstate roads.  I would rather have the larger engine in the Z-24 version though because it produces 150 horsepower while mine produces only 120.  Still good for a kid my age.  In my opinion the car looks great, friends give me a compliments when they see my car for the first time.  The car was bought for $5400 used at a local dodge dealer in early 2002 so it was about 4-5 years old.  It currently has approx. 80,000 and is running great.  I get great gas economy, about 28 in the city and 32 on the highway and interstate.  I've never worried about the car getting me to where I have to go except some of those cold mornings going to school.  It has stalled maybe twice because of the weather when it got to around 5 degrees F.  and it would have helped if I let the car warm up in the morning but I don't like leaving the car sitting with the doors unlocked while I'm inside.  I'm not sure how the factory sound system is but with a decent cd player and slightly older rear speakers, the car sounds great.  I've had no trouble with the stock front door speakers.  A rep at a car audio store said that anything sounds good in a cavalier and I agree.  My two $35 10" subs sound pretty good in the trunk.  Before I put the subs in I was amazed by the trunk space and also how the back seat could fold down.  The only really big problem that I've seen is the water that accumulated in the trunk.  When I bought the car I noticed a few weeks after that there was water in the spare tire well.  So, I sopped up the water with a towel and put a wad of duck tape (yes, i call it duck) in a small opening in the trunk behind the carpet around where the taillights are wired in.  The accessory net in the back is pretty good for keeping small things from rolling around an empty trunk. When the weather is hot, I turn on my AC and often must turn it down or off because I get too cold.  If you wanna burn some domestic rice, don't by the base model with the 2.2 L, by the Z-24 with the 2.4 L engine.  The rear defroster works great.  The front could be better.  The front seat is pretty roomy but the rear seats leave something to be desired but I don't usually cram 500 clowns into my car, however, it can hold a baritone saxophone lengthwise snugly.  The middle seat in the back is quite hard to sit on because of the hump in the middle of the car.  The alternator is pretty good, rated at 105 amps.  The windshield wipers are pretty good and cover a large portion of the windshield  

As I said before I use the car to drive to school every day and have had no driving problems with the car.  My girlfriend drives a 1991 Acura Integra and she drove my car and said that she really liked how the manual transmission  shifted.  

Cup holders are a minor problem with one in the glove box between the two seats which I frequently use to hold my change and the cup holder directly in front of the shifter that is really only good for a small drink because the holder isn't very deep and I hit my hand against the drink when I shift to 1st, 3rd, and 5th.  Shifting is a lot better since I got an APC sport shifter to replace the factory one.  For anyone who would like to replace their factory shift knob, it is not held on by threads like on a screw as imports are so you have to remove the "U" shaped pin on the front side of the shifter (manual trans, maybe auto?) with a key or small flat-head screwdriver.  The best experience I've had has been with the shift knobs that come with special sleeves to be slipped over the bare shift stick.  The factory floor mats aren't very good and I replaced them recently with large, heavy, rubber ones.  Also, I have had some trouble myself and have seen other Cavaliers of similar model years that have lost or began to lose their front stone guard.  I'm currently holding one side of mine on with black duck tape.  I also get a little off of my insurance with my ABS, drivers side airbag, and passenger side airbag.  Stupid under 25 rates!  

All in all, I would recommend this car to anybody who needs a reliable drive and doesn't expect to have the quality of a Lincoln, BMW, or Mercedes.  I hope this has helped anybody who was looking into buying a Cavalier.  If you have any questions, leave a response thing on below this epinion.
