            Wow... i test drove one of these babies, and boy i tell ya... it's FAST!!! Think about it almost as much horse power as a prelude but smaller and lighter then a civic. Now thats a dangerous combination! but to get this high flying roadster it'll cost you a pretty penny... $32,000 pretty ones. I myself wouldn't purchase it.... It's a nice toy for the richer folks, it's also extremly hard to get ahold of. It's nearly has hard to find a Type-R integra. Acceration is superb, of course the drive noise isn't all that great considering its a rag-top. <br><br>
