            I have had my Lexus RX-300 for one year and I  am thrilled.  The Rx-300 is the first Sport Utility Vehicle that drives like a car.  The engine has plenty of pick-up and is smooth around corners.  The interior is very luxurious and comfortable. The Nokomichi sound system is fantastic.  The feature I like best about the interior of the RX-300 is the information screen.  It is easy to read.  The leg room is ample and five can sit very comfortably.  The only thing I would change about my RX-300 is the trunk space.  The back seats can fold down to make the area bigger but if you have children that sit in the back, it can be inconvenient.  The other big selling point is the Lexus service.  You are treated like royalty and they stand behind their product.  You are never inconvenienced.  The price may seem expensive to some, but looking at the Explorer and Cherokee, it is not too much more, yet you get a vehicle that is much more luxurious and the ride cannot be beat.  It is a great car for small families.  Bigger families will find it to be too small.<br><br>
