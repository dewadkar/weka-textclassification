            The honda accord is an excellent family sedan with much comfort, reliability, and great potential. There are many upgrades to increase horsepower and looks of your accord. You can even make your accord look like a sports car and run like one as well. You can probably make as much horsepower as an eight cylinder hotrod without sacrificing much gas mileage. the car already comes with a peppy four cylinder that can out run some six cylinders. It feels like it has more hp than a Mustang and is actually very noticable. The car has a very nice ride. The a/c and heater work very well and are powerful but they really cut down on hp. the seats are comfortable and i really like the steering of the accord. Overall i have no complaints and i am looking forward to upgrading the engine and look.<br><br>
