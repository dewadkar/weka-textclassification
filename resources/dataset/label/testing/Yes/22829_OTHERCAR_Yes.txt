            I never thought I would ever be driving a mini van!  Well times have changed and so did my marital status.  I am married with one and only one child but love all the room for other passengers as well as visiting relatives.

I really like driving my '97 Town &amp; Country mini van.  I like being high up and being able to see over all those big vehicles on the road.  I am only 5' tall and find it very easy to drive (I do not have any trouble touching the pedals), and I love the automatic everything (adjustable seat, windows, doors).  I especially love the extra left side passenger door.  It makes putting my daughter in and out of her booster seat a pleasure.

I really love all the windows the Town &amp; Country has, it makes road trips trips a pleasure for everyone no matter where they are sitting to enjoy the scenery.

I have my van for almost a year and never needed to bring it to the shop, I find it very low maintance.<br><br>
