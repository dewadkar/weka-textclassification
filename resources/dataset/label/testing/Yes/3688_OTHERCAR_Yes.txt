            Hondas are without a doubt good cars. The 2001 Civic LX is no exception. I would definitely recommend this car if you're looking for reliability, and you cannot, possibly spend over 15k for a car. If you can go higher than 15k, get a VW Jetta, they're excellent. Otherwise, read on... 

I believe that the recent changes to the Civic have made it less appealing somewhat. It's still an excellent car that is absolutely at the head of it's class, but I think that Honda has done little to improve the performance and "feel" of the Civic in it's most recent incarnation and they've lost the low-slung aggressive look of previous years' models. Here are some details:

-Aesthetics. There are two basic body styles for the Civic: 4-door sedan (this is what I have), and the 2-door coupe. The latter is definitely one of the most visually stunning Hondas. I like it better than the 2-door Accord even! It's the best looking Civic ever. It's sister, the 4-door is a stark contrast, and by far the ugliest Civic ever! The 4-door reminds me of a Geo for some reason... Avoid it unless you have a family. Colors all seem to be standard fare, mine is called Plum, and it goes well with the tan interior. I did notice that the paint is not coated very thick, so even shallow scratches seem to show primer.

-Interior. The interior is pretty nice. The cloth seats are very attractive and easy to clean. The dash surfaces are nice, and the gauges are standard Honda (utilitarian). The AM/FM Cassette is very good (although I do have a problem with the tiny, hidden scan button), and the speakers are about what you'd expect from a car this cheap (I do plan on replacing the whole shebang). The front and rear leg room is outstanding! They have somehow managed to eliminate that annoying "hump" in the floorboard of the backseat, which is cool. The floormats (2 for the front, one BIG one for the back) are nice and thick, but will cost an extra $75.00. The gear selector for the Automatic Transmission is handsomely adorned with a brushed aluminum strip, and is nicely shaped. The steering wheel is anemic and slippery, but seems ideal for my wife's tiny hands. The power locks and windows are nestled smartly into the door handles. This model also boasts power mirrors, remote trunk and fuel door, cruise control, and standard air conditioning all of which work pretty darn well. The small glove box is a downer. So is the console storage (because there is none), so plan on hiding your stuff under the seats. That's a problem particularly if you use a Disc-Man to play CDs through the cassette player, 'cause there's no good place to keep the stupid thing (my wife's was in fact stolen from the car because it wasn't hidden well enough). All in all, the inside of the car is nicely appointed for the price. Definitely a selling point.


-Reliability. Honda has had a long time to perfect this specific class of car ('cause they basically invented it). It really shows when you put this car next to a similarly priced competitor like say a Ford Focus or a Dodge Neon (Stay away from the Neons), and even higher level Hyundai Accents. The quality and design of the Civic in general, beats the competition on all points.

-Ride. The ride of the Civic is good. It has excellent cornering for a car of it's class and it's suspension seems to be nice and firm even after three months of abuse. The only thing that really lacks is the horsepower. I have the automatic Transmission, and I believe the engine is a 1.7 liter, 115 hp, four cylinder. On paper this seems like plenty for such a light car, but one wonders where the horses are hiding while you're actually driving! My 2000 Jetta has a 2.0 liter that's also rated at 115hp and blows the doors off of the Civic (of course it also has a manual trans. and set me back 6k more than the Civic). I am aware that the next model up has a gutsier VTEC engine, if you like (or need) passing power, consider the upgrade. Seat comfort was also good, although, I wonder what would happen if I gained a couple of inches around the waist 'cause the seat pretty much wraps snug around my sides.

-Price. I shelled-out 13,300.00 for this car, brand new, in February. I went to the dealer with one of those ads from the paper that had that 13k price advertised and they actually honored it. That was cool, and I feel like I got the car for a good price (I think it sells for 15k+ regularly), with no haggling. Interestingly enough, I would have gone for another Jetta if the Civic's price had been higher than 15k, so consider the fact that a lot more car can still be had for not much more money.


Bottom line is that if you are looking for a passenger car, and you want it new and loaded for under 15k, the Civic is your car. If you can go up in price even $2000.00, don't do it - you can find a better car than this.
