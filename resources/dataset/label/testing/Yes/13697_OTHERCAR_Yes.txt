            I first leased a Mazda 626 in 1996. When my lease was up, I bought a 1999 626 LX V6. I can honestly say that I will not ever drive anything else.

It has great performance, minimal repairs needed, and is more economically priced than its major competitors: Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. It keeps its value better than most other models in its class if you want to consider trading it in or selling it. 

It has the convenience of a &quot;family car&quot;, yet its sleek design makes it appear &quot;sporty&quot;. Interior options are plentiful and pleasing.

Once you move up to the V6 from the 4 cylinder, I feel you make up for the lost gas mileage by gaining the acceleration and power of a V6. Basically it is a matter of what is important to you and preferences.

One drawback is the smaller back seat. It really doesn't fit more than 2 passengers comfortably.

Overall, I can't stop recommending this car to family and friends.<br><br>
