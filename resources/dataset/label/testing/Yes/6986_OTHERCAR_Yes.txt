            If you ever find yourself walking through a used car lot looking for a decent but cheaper SUV... keep you eyes peeled for a '94 chevy blazer!! When I was first learning to drive I had no choice but to learn in my dad's '94 GLOWING green blazer. Of course I was a little embarrassed to be seen in this oddly colored car... but now I can look past the colors of cars!

As A new car everything seemed perfect! The wheel was nice and tight, the breaks and gas worked perfectly without any un-welcomed squeaks. Now that the car is about 6 years old it has had its rough times (in the winter) but it is usually a very reliable car.

Now if you're seeking more technical information... I'm not gonna be able to do that for ya. :\ But I am gonna let everyone know that this car is a pretty good car (nothing wonderful or different...but still!).

The interior is pretty nice as well. It has cloth seats with a vinyl backs (the part where you sit is cloth). I especially like this because when the car sits in the sun, the seats won't bake your butt! There is also a pretty good single cup/mug holder in the front. That works quite well for the coffee addicts! =) Oh yes! I can't forget the stereo either. I love how the channel changer is a nob you spin rather than a button you press. It's great if you're anything like me and flip channels constantly! The same goes for the volume control.

What about the back seats and trunk? Both are an okay size. Yes there are other SUV's with more room than this. But for the most part the size of the Chevy Blazer seems to work! 4 people can squeeze into the back seat if need be, although 3 fit more comfortably. Then comes the trunk section! I find the trunk very helpful for transporting things from place to place (I.E. all my horseback riding gear would get to sit there when I was younger and would compete.). Again it's not exactly big but it will can fit a LOT of random stuff. =]

In all I have found this car to be a comfy, reliable, and all around safe feeling car! I would recommend this to people with a family of 5 or to teens (enough space for carting friends around and their &quot;luggages&quot; ;}<br><br>
