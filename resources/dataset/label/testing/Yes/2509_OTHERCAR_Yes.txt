Why Did I Buy This Car?

I own a 1990 Eagle Summit, base model, with a spoiler, to make it look fast. Automatic, with heat?/AC, and cruise control that doesn't work, manual windows and locks. It's not too bad, but it makes you feel as if something is missing...

I got this car when I turned 18, from my grandparents. I waited until 18 to get my drivers license, and so when I got my license, I took a drive with my grandparents in my new car. I was pretty happy, it's in perfect condition body wise, nice shiny paint, no dents, interior is great, but what my grandparents didn't realize is there is something under the hood that needs taken care of too.

Repairs.

I take them for a drive, and when we leave where we went, the car wouldn't start. Luckily we were right next to a battery place. 70 bucks gone on a new battery. My first day. Also, my passenger side steering axel is bad, apperently my grandparents never heard the loud clicking the car makes when the broken boot of the u-joint or whatever makes when you turn. 350 bucks for that. 20 dollars to get the windshield wipers to spurt out the washer fluid. 200 for exhaust system. 150 for radiator/transmission flush and fill Good thing I got this for free. Brakes are pretty good, tho I think they need some work. Oh yea, new tires were needed to, but that's not the cars fault. 200 for new set of BF Goodriches.

Driviability.

Acceleration is bad, but this car only has 80 horsepower, so that's expected. It can keep up there tho, I got this puppy up to 110, but that fast, the steering wheel, and anything else shakes badly, so I slowed down. For me I get around 30mpg, with an 11 gallon tank. All in all, after the repairs, I have a very well running car, the engine is going strong...well, not strong, but GOOD. Always starts in winter, driving is easy, front wheel drive, seats are comfortable for me, I'm 19, 230lbs, so they can hold some weight. I don't like the lack of a tilt steering wheel, tho. Driving is nice, bumps are smooth, but when you have more than 2 people, acceleration is worse, and bumps are more noticeable, but that's cuz I need new shocks too. 

Features.

Trunk space is decent for a car this small, at least I think so. It fits my JBL BP600.1 amplifier and 12 inch Infinity Perfect sub nicely, with room to spare. I don't like how the trunk lacks carpeting on the top and sides, only the floor. Seats are comfy, for a few hours, it's a pain when you finally get out of the car after 3 hrs or so. For me, the windshield wipers didn't clear enough of the windshield, but I can deal with that, oh yea, I don't like how they do not have the intermittent wiper setting, only slow or fast. Stereo got surprisingly loud, I only had the AM/FM radio, sounded quite nice. Of course, I replaced that with a Kenwood Excelon X815 CD player, replace all 4 speakers with high quality ones, and a sub and amp, your good to go.
It also sits a little too low, so everyon'es headlights shine directly in my face, and in the rearview mirror. But I can put up with temporary blindness.


Who should Buy This Car?

Anyone who's looking for a second car, or a first car for thier kids, go for it. It's not the greatest, but it's a lot better than some of the junkers you see putzing along the road. <br><br>
