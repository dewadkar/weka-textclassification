            I purchased my 1991 Dodge Spirit used and have had a positive experience with it.  The automobile currently has 98,000 miles on it and has been a significantly dependable car.  With only routine maintenance (oil changes, muffler, brakes) I cannot say much bad about this car.  The size is very comfortable for both front and back seat passengers.  Fit and finish are pretty good for an American car of it's era, although certainly not on a par with the Toyota Camry or even the Toyota Corolla.  For the price this was a very good car!<br><br>
