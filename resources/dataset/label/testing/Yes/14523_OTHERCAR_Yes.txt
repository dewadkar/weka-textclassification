            I bought this 1990 Mitsubishi Mighty Max with a 2.4Liter 4cylinder fuel-injected engine matched to a 5-speed manual transmission. The truck is as basic as you can get; manual windows, locks and no power steering. It does have A/C though. It is a regular cab with a bench seat.

This particular truck I purchased was customized.  It had ground effects all around and wider wheels and tires (15inch versus the OEM 14inchers). The truck bed had a drop-in liner.

 The engine is up to task exhibiting a good amount of low end torque. The manual transmission is geared to take full advantage of it. The engine idles and revs smoothly across its RPM range thanks to its dual balance shafts.

The suspension is on the stiff side to allow for heavier payloads which the truck accepts without any trouble. I had loaded the truck with about 500 pounds of cargo, the rear suspension hardly moved down. I am told the truck has a payload of approximately 1500 pounds. Comparable Nissan, Toyota, Mazda (Ford) pick-up trucks when loaded down with cargo the rear suspension is compressed considerably.
However this larger payload has a trade-off, the rear suspension is a little bouncy when unloaded. The truck bed is low to the ground easing loading/unloading of cargo.

The steering being unassisted makes low-speed turns difficult with one hand. This problem is exaggerated due to the wider than normal tires installed on this truck. OEM size wheel/tires should make it easier. While moving though, the truck is easy to handle, bordering on sporty thanks to its stiff suspension. 

The dashboard is simply designed with no fancy gimmicks. The large speedometer is flanked by the fuel gauge and temperature gauge, as well as the customary warning lights.
Showing true to its age, the parking brake is a push/pull umbrella style. The steering column does tilt. 
The seats (bench-style) are very thinly padded and cause back-aches under long use. There is a surprising amount of room behind the bench seat, enough for a toolbox and small bags. Although there are 3 sets of seatbelts, only 2 passengers are recommended because of the floor mounted gear-shifter and transmission tunnel. (Automatic model have a column shifter). 
Road and tire noise is noticeable and becomes overbearing at highway speeds. Insufficient soundproofing is obvious.
Visibility is good all around, aided by the tall side windows and large mirrors. The wipers are a little slow and have difficulty keeping the windshield clear in a downpour. The headlight brightness is merely adequate. 
On the plus side the air-conditioner works very well, cooling the cabin within a minute even on a hot day.

Troublespots:
The entire suspension creaks and squeeks. The front suspension has an alignment problem which eats up your front tires. However the truck drives straight. 
The engine when sitting or idling for a while, emits exhaust smoke (indicative of a valve stem seal failure). The drive belts have a tendency to squeal despite replacements.

Its physical appearance denotes a work truck and it delivers on that image.

UPDATE: 12/10/2003
The valve stems/guides were replaced eliminating the exhaust smoke. Cost to repair (parts & labor) $180.
Observed fuel mileage (mixed city/hwy): 22mpg
