            This is a highly popular sport utility with a good look and a roomy interior.  When it started (1996), it was just a Tacoma with a roof and two more seats.  Nothing fancy.  But the new 4Runners are getting more luxurious, more power, and more features.  Now you can get a 4Runner with a full time 4 wheel drive, leather interior and did I say a very good look!  It comes in 3 models: 4Runner (original), 4Runner SR5 (sporty) and 4Runner Limited (luxurious).  It has matured so much over the four makeovers, that 4Runner's Limited interior features can be compared to its big brothers, the Landcruiser and the Lexus 470.  It is roomy in headroom, legroom, and in the trunk (perfect for a family getaway).  It's handling on curvy roads has been upgraded to world class.  But you still could feel big bumps.  Only downsize to this sport utility is the horsepower.  Eventhough the 4Rnners are getting more and more power by the years, it's not (yet) competetive against Isuzu Rodeo (a very close contender of 4Runner).  But Hey!  A fully loaded 4Runner is well under $40,000 range, a well bargain I would say.<br><br>
