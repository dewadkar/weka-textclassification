             When I was looking for an a replacement for my Trooper, I wanted something smaller, with great styling and better power then the Trooper. I did look at plenty of other SUV's and found the Axiom fit my needs and budget best. Yeah, it does have a truck like ride which can be a little disappointing for the urban SUV driver, but the AXIOM rides well on the offroad and that is what I expect from a tough SUV. Rule of thumb, if it rides like a luxury vehicle, you better not venture beyond the smooth roads. I live in Colorado and the Axiom is a rock crusher! I have tested the Axiom beyond the limits that most of my friends would take their SUV's and it worked flawless. I am not real thrilled with the TOD system, although it works well, I am used to being able to engage to a full time four wheel drive mode. I think the TOD type systems are a by-product of people being to lazy to  activate the 4x4 system on there own. The biggest disappointment is the ability to change out the stock stereo to an aftermarket system. The stock system is fantastic on quality of sound and works well but I wanted to install an aftermarket Satellite stereo I was not able to do so. I was able to install a portable satellite receiver to integrate with the Isuzu stereo with no problems. I found most upper end SUV's and cars now had somekind of special stereo that cannot be replaced by an aftermarket system.  Gas mileage has been adequate (18 mpg with a good mix of city and highway miles) I have seen as high as 25mpg average of pure highway driving and as low as 17mpg around town. Four wheeling in the mountains carrying a heavy load got me down to the low of 13mpg. I am a little concerned as to the future of Isuzu in North America. Isuzu is suppose to be getting ready to redo there image and vehicle styling over the next few years in order to stay in business. 
Isuzu's are being built by Fuji industries in Indiana along with Subaru's (The door jam build plate reads Isuzu Subaru company on my Axiom)
