            I bought my lunar mist 2003 Corolla when it first became available to consumers. I absolutely love it and have no complaints.  Of course, I am not really picky when it comes to cars!

I am a small person, so it fits me perfectly.  I can understand why a tall person would have a bit of trouble with the seating.  I like that I can raise and lower the seat.  My boyfriend has an Eclipse, and I hate driving it, because he doesn't have tilt wheel and I can barely see over the steering wheel!  You can also adjust the height of the seat belt, which is nice.  My last car was a 95 Corolla, and it didn't have these features.  The seat conforms to my back perfectly, I feel very comfortable when I drive this car.

The new design was needed, the 2002 was starting to look dated.  The wheels are slightly bigger, and the seats are higher off of the ground.  The CD player is standard and the dash is so user friendly.  The buttons are nice and big. I don't have to take my eyes off of the road for very long.  I hate small buttons! The rear view mirror adjust automatically when bright headlights are behind you, which is a nice feature.  I also like the wood-like accents.  It dresses up the interior a bit, makes it look more upscale.
The speedometor and other gauges are illuminated at night, which makes it quite easy to read.

As far as actual driving goes, I have no complaints. It is a very smooth ride for a small car, and accelerates quite quickly for only a 4 cylinder.  Gas mileage is awesome!38 miles per gallon on the highway! I drive 50 miles each way to work, so that is important to me. 

All in all, this is a great looking car that drives very well. I have had so many compliments on this car!
