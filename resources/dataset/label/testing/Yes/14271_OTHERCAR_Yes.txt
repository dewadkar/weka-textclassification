            The design for the Mazda Rx-7 from 93-95 was one of a kind. This car is already an antique because there were so few made. The Rx-7 is a great used car going from 0-60 mph in 4.9 SECONDS! This is completely stock and the reason it can go this fast is because of its weight to horsepower ratio. The Rx-7 has a ratio of 10.9:1, which is amazing. The ratio is better than that of the NSX, Nissan 300ZX, and the 3000GT. The puts out about 255 horsepower with 217 lbs of torque. The reason for this cars great performance is its rotary powered engine. It has a two rotor powered engine, which is different from most conventional motors with pistons. Not only does the car run great it also looks great. I personally like the Competition Yellow Mica color with the spoiler on back. The car looks great with the thick yellow paint and black tinted rear lights. This car also has a 50/50 weight distribution in the front and back which accounts for its great handling. The interior is really nice with plenty of head room although it is only a two-seater. The car runs for about 14k from '93. This is a really great price because of its rarity and performance. It is one of the faster cars on the road and you will not have to 50k for a new fast car. This car is overall very good except the oil has to be changed on time at about every 3k miles. If the oil is not changed the rotary powered engine will not last that long. <br><br>
