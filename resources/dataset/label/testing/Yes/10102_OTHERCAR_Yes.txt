            Recently I wrote an opinion about my 1996 Mercury Sable telling everyone how much I loved it and how great a car it was.  This is a followup to that opinion, and tells of the first major problem I've had (I consider any time my car won't run to be a major problem).  Recently I noticed that my Sable didn't want to start as easily in the morning as I thought it should. I took it to a service center and found that my battery was going bad.  I thought this was reasonable since the car has approximately 45,000 miles on it now.  A week later my car is back in the shop. Seems that even though the battery was bad, this wasn't the real problem. The fuel injection system is entirely gunked up, requiring total disassembly and cleaning, and a part called an idle sensor or controller(I believe that's right) was'nt functioning right and will have to be replaced. Cost , around $100.00. Plus, no one in my area has the gaskets to reassemble the fuel injection system and we had to order them overnight from my local Ford dealer. Major inconvenience! 
My mechanic, who I have dealt with for over 7 years, told me that he has several cars of this type with the same problem when getting close to 40,000 miles. He showed me the parts from my car and it was a miracle the car  still started at all.  Haven't gotten the total bill yet, but feel that if I get by with under $400 I'll be lucky!
If you own a used Sable might want to check with your mechanic about cleaning the fuel injection at your next tuneup.  <br><br>
