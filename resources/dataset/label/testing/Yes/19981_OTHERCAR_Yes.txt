             I bought my Beretta new in October '94. I didn't intend to I just fell in love with that sharp lookin' number in the showroom.
 One small item was amiss the ,A/C did not work.After seven years and 198K miles it has only been functional about 10% of the time but when you're still getting 36 miles per gallon consistently,I can overlook such petty problems.
 This is without a doubt the finest automobile I have ever owned.I haven't performed any major service of any kind since I've owned this car.The original tires lasted nearly 100K miles!It still starts without fail on the coldest day, runs flawlessly handles like a new one and I've got the original clutch,struts and muffler.
 So riddle me this,why in the world did G.M. quit producing this automobile?I'd have already bought a new one if I could.A funny parallel can be drawn with my '84 Chevette,they quit making a car I would have been glad to buy.What the world needs now is a good cheap car. <br><br>
