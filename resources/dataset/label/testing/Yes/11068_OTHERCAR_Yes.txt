            When the Audi TT came out, I didn't really know what to make of it.  I thought the car looked nice in pictures and from what I read was well built.  Then I saw a few on the road, and I begin to REALLY like these little gems.  They have this aesthetic appeal that I find hard to explain.  Much like the new PT Cruiser, it shares design cues with older cars (in the case of the TT, a Porsche 356 comes to mind), yet it has it's own design that ultimately looks like nothing else.  To add to the scenario, I am a huge VW/Audi fan.

When I got my most recent car, a VW Corrado (which I love to death), I got a chance to check out the TT in a bit closer detail, since the dealer also sold Audi's.  I was quite impressed with the interior design and fit and finish.  Everything looked clean, well placed, and designed for maximum utility.  I was definitely sold on this car.

The best part of the story came when my mom was looking for a fun, relatively inexpensive, sports car.  Now, my mom isn't a huge car person (though hanging around with my dad and I has definitely made her more automotively aware), but she had a good idea what she was looking for.  In the end, the choice was between the TT roadster (which is the convertible for those not familiar with the terminology) and BMW Z3 2.8.  My mom tested both cars.  The Z3 was pretty loaded and had an automatic.  Now maybe it had to do with the fact that it was a rainy dat, but my mom just wasn't very impressed.  She didn't really know why, but she had this emotionless reaction to her brief time piloting the Bimmer.  However the TT was a completely different story.  We tested the 225hp version of the TT roadster (R).  My mom absolutely loved the car.  I know that she didn't get to flex the muscle that this car has, but she just liked the way it drove and the way it felt in her hands, like it was designed just for her.  I guess that is cool, but I insisted on getting a test drive so that I can see what the car was about.  So I got a chance to flex the car a bit.  All I can say is wow.  This baby moves like few other cars.  For a rather heavy car (3300 lbs or so) it was very quick and nimble.  I was very light on its feet.  Not to mention that the exhaust was fantastic.  This is a real sports car.  I should also mention that this test drive occured on a sunny day with the top down.  Plus, the 225hp TT's come standard with Quattro all-wheel drive, which is also a nice performance/safety feature.

My mom my so impressed with the car, that she bought a TT R on the spot.  The salesman thought that I pressured my mom into this, but it was definitely all her idea; I wanted her to look around a little more.  She liked the car so much, she wasn't even bothered by the fact that it only comes with a manual tranny.  Let me tell ya, that is definitely love, since my mom isn't a very good stick driver.  Anyway, the car that my mom ended up ordering (it took 3 months to arrive) was a silver TT R that had the 180hp engine, which is plenty adequate for my mom.  It has the performance package and luxury package ( I think that is the name of it).  My mom just got the car in Novemeber.  Naturally I drove home from school in Pennsylvania to check it out.  Visually speaking, it really is a stunning car to look at up close.  The paint is flawless, the seams in the body are perfect, and the whole car looks like it was molded out of a single chunk of metal.  The wheels are beautiful as well.  The interior doesn't disappoint either.  The gauges are rather retro looking with a shiny aluminum ring around the speedo and tach.  The gauges are easy to read and look great.  The controls are perfectly positioned and feel great to press.  The steering wheel is thick leather which is sooo comfy to squeeze.   The stereo isn't bad either.  It is an 8 speaker Bose system with 6 disk changer behind the seat.

Coming home to check out this beauty I fully expected to take the car out, and that I did.  My mom let me and my gf cruise around in it for a few hours.  When I got my grubby hands on it, the odomoter read 152 or so miles.  It was just warm enough to drive with the top down as well.  I felt like a million bucks driving this thing.  It is solid, has a supple ride, great Audi steering, and fantastic shifter.  In fact, this is the easiest stick I have ever driven.  You could easily teach someone to drive stick in this because the clutch is so light (although why someone would do that to such a nice car is beyond me).  Since the car was so new I didn't really get a chance to bend it around any tight corners, but I was able to infer from some mild driving that it definitely liked the twisties.  Speaking of handling, I should mention that the 180 hp TT R's are not available with Quattro, so front wheel drive is the only way it comes.  I should also mention that with the top up, you would never know that it is a soft top.  The canvass (sp) is tight and doesn't flap around when driven.  A very well engineered top.  It is actually, one of the very few convertibles that I have ever seen that I like with the top up as well as down.

If there was an area that I wasn't fully impressed with, it would be the engine.  At 180hp, this car is no screamer.  You aren't going to win any drag races or many track races.  The 180 hp is merely ample, at best, it would be considered marginally better than ample.  There is definitely some pep in this car, but it just doesn't seem to really launch.  I know that my VR6 Corrado would easily take it in any race (if you don't beleive me check out the figures for both cars in any car mag).  However, the car isn't designed to be a hot rod.  It is more of a classic sports car.  It has very nice, well blalnce handling and ample power, which I would imagine would also be the case with many of the MG's and Alfas from the 70's and 80's.  However, unlike these cars the TT is super refined and very reliable.  I shoud not that all TT's are turbo charged.  In opposition to the 225hp TT R, the 180 version has very little turbo lag.  Power delivery is quite linear. 

If you are looking for a fun car that will always put a smile on your face, whether you are driving it, looking at it, or see another one on the road as you are driving, this is definitely the car.<br><br>
