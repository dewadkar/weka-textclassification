            I inherited this car when I married my husband. It is a light-iris pearl color w/ a black top &amp; a V6 engine. He bought the car in October 1996 with 25,000 miles. I am the main driver of the car, and I have grown fond of it. At first, I thought that having convertible would be horrible for my hair. I still do, but there are sometimes that it is very nice to have top down &amp; the wind in my face.

Today, 50,000 miles later, it has been a very reliable car. We have had no major problems with it. We have performed only routine maintenance &amp; replaced the tires at 65,000. 

This is a very comfortable car, when in the front seat. The back is small &amp; not roomy. I try to avoid riding back there &amp; or making anyone else. When the top is on, I feel like the car is really small &amp; enclosed because the top is black &amp; I feel like there's not a lot of light. When it's down, it's a whole other story. I enjoy driving it with the top down, because when it's up, you have a limited viewing section when looking back.

It's a very sharp, good looking car. One thing is that little dents from other car doors or shopping carts show pretty obvious. Another thing is that on the trunk, we have two spots on the lid, each about six inches long, where the color is fading. Not sure what exactly is happening. My husband is taking it to a body shop sometime soon, to see what we can do for it.

The top has a bit of a whistle. It's really happens only when it get windy &amp; we are going against the wind. It sometimes also has a bit of a leak when it rains. One thing to note about our windows is that the two main windows have long scratches going vertical down the center from going up and down. I have seen it in other sebrings too.

This car is a good for a single person, couple or as a second car. I would not recommend it for families as a family car, nor if you were to use the back seat for people to ride in often. Overall, we are happy with this car. It has been very reliable.
