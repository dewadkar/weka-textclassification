            I have had my Z1 for about three weeks now.  I found it a good compromise between a point-and-shoot simple camera and a moderately advanced camera.  The best feature is the X10 Zoom. To my surprise I have found at least one occasion when the additional X4 electronic zoom proved useful, making the difference between getting no shot at all and at least a useable, though grainy, shot. A tripod or a monopod is a must for any zoom over about 4.
I have taken several hundred shots so far, and had no problem with the purple color fringe some other reviewers have reported. Picture quality has been very good, with the images sharp and colors good. The video clips are clear, with the only problems being the auto focus noise being very noticeable on the playback. 
The menus are clear and easy to work though, although it does take too long to make significant changes in situations where you are shooting wild life any more active than a sunning alligator. I guess that is the compromise you make, you get a great number of options you can set, but you cannot set them quickly.
The 16 MB SD Chip the camera ships with is nearly useless.  Minolta would be better off shipping it without any chip and lowering the price.  The first thing you need to do is get the largest and fastest SD Chip you can afford. I recommend at least a 128 MB Chip.
The only really bad aspect  of the Z1 is the camera housing is too flimsy and has a cheap plastic feel to it. The covers over the battery case as well as the USB/SD Chip access seem so poorly made I have to wonder how long they will last before breaking off.  While the camera body has a great feel when holding it, due to its shape, I wish Minolta had spent just a little more to make the plastic on the body and covers thicker and more substantial.
I paid $302 total at Butterfly Photo.  Bottom line - you get a lot of camera for the money, but it appears that you need to treat if gently.
