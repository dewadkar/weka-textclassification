            I love my truck...we bought it in 95 and havent seen any real problems yet...none that the truck produced because of manufacturing defects...This is one tough truck! It has been on long trips, seen plenty of mud in its time, and lots of city driving as well...the only thing that has ever needed to be done is resurface the clutch because it is a manual transmission...the 60/40 seats are great for packing tailgating stuff for 49er games, and when you need to take people around town, it has a very roomy interior. Whenever I have needed to haul something, my explorer has done the job and done it well. I dont think I will get rid of my Explorer for years to come...its just so great...find one if you can, but avoid the automatic transmission at all costs!!! Oh yea, and it has one of the strongest heaters I have ever felt...its nice in the winter!
