            Speaking strictly from a non-professional users point of view whom I believe is the consumer target market for this camera), I will briefly outline my findings.

I borrowed this spur-of-the-moment from my niece who just received it a month earlier as a Christmas present (what a great gal - don't know if I'd give it up so easily. Guess all that diaper changing paid off after all!) We (my daughter and I) wanted to use it for a Backstreet Boys Concert and personal meeting with them. I brought a conventional camera as a back-up just in case I deleted the pictures.

The user manual was very descript and not difficult to understand. I learned how to use the camera's basic features within the hour and 15 minute ride to the show. (I wasn't kidding when I said spur-of-the-moment!)

**PROS***

1) Easy to click and shoot. Zooming button is right next to the picture-taking button (told you I was an amateur).

2) When you run out of room (about 36 pictures on high quality), you can download or delete unwanted (also listed under cons).

3) The pictures can be viewed (most recent one first, the rest seems in somewhat random order that is listed under cons) for relatively easy and immediate deletion.

4) No need for film!!!!!

5) No need to develop (or forgetting to develop) film.

6) Red eye reduction feature is good, but delays taking of the picture which is crucial when filming squirming kids.

7) Easy cropping, editing and manipulation of pictures once downloaded.

8) Easy and immediate sending of your pictures over the internet.


**CONS**
1) Uses MEGA amounts of battery power. Especially if you keep shifting from viewing the pictures and taking them. DEFINITELY invest in rechargeable batteries with a recharger.

2) Very cumbersome to switch from taking the pictures to viewing them. It involves closing the front lense (huhhh!) and pushing the back button to turn viewer on (unless you are in that mode already to take pictures by screen, but that increases the chance of a fuzzy picture and drains the batteries faster). I disliked this feature the most - especially under the conditions we took the pictures. Confused? Let me elaborate to make my point clear....

We were in a dark colliseum, trying to take as many good shots as possible. After I thought I got all I wanted, the BSB appeared two rows behind us (!!) and I had NO MORE SHOTS!! I scrambled to view/delete some shots to make room for more pictures. This is tough enough to do quickly in GOOD lighting as the camera takes it's time slowly scrolling each picture taken in some random order,then repeats the same 2 or 3 when you're expecting a newer picture to view for deletion. Couple this dilemma with being in a mostly-dark environment and trying to remember the right buttons (one to view, an arrow to scroll, one to mark for deletion, the up arrow to mark the "yes" box for deletion, and a separate "ok" button to confirm and execute deletion. FIVE STEPS! YIKES!!!) Now do you get the flavor for what I'm taking about??  

3) The need to download and use their Camedia software to download the pictures. 

4) The need to purchase the AC adapter.


It is a great concept, but there are too many interfaces required for operation and bugs to iron out. I shall research further before purchasing my own digital camera. I hear Sony uses a standard disc, which would make use and downloading so much easier than this camera has to offer.
