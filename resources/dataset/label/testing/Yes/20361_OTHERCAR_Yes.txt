            I bought this vehicle because of its great looks, great price, long list of creature comforts, and it's potent choice of great engines.
I love the way this vehicle rides and handles especially on bumpy and smooth roads.  I like the optimum performance of the 3.3 liter v6, the 3.0 v6, and 2.5 liter 4 cylinders aren't bad either, but the 3.3 is top of the line.  Drive it and you'll find out why.  It is very roomy and has enough options that'll be sure to please even the chinciest buyers for the price it is not only fair, but unbeatable. look at the competition.  Chevy lumina, and Ford Taurus.  One car wreak in the Lumina, its history, I know a Dynasty that survived being hit by a semi and was very drivable.  The Taurus is pretty pricy, but an actual Dynasty has lasted 500,000 miles on a 3.0 liter v6 with the proper care and maintenace.  Not only that engine size on a Lumina is a small 3.1v6 for the best motor, and the power under the hood just doesn't compare.  The 3.8 v6 in the taurus eats a bit more gas and doesn't deliver any better passing power.  Options on Dynastys include(note: this doesn't mean every Dynasty will have these options)  Optional power sunroof/moonroof, optional Infinity am/fm Cassette or standard Chrysler radio, optional keyless remote entry, eight way power driver and passenger seating, driver side airbag on 90 and newer.  3 point seatbelts on 90s and newer.  optional alloy wheels.  optional anti theft alarm.  I haven't seen chevy and Ford deliver nearly this much on the competition models.  Things to hate on this car is the transmission, it is very fragile and can break easily even with the best of driving and care, it is called the A-604 transmission and is notorious for problems and isn't recommended if you drive real far distances or are always going in passing gear.  Other than this the car is absolutely perfect.  The 89's faced computer problems, but the computers are anywhere from $138.00 to $225.00 at most. Other than this I have owned several including a 88, 89, 90, and a 92.  I love the Dynastys and these cars engines can survive the worst driving habits.  <br><br>
