            Well this car is actually a friend of mine. They bought this car because they needed a more newer and reliable car. They fell in love with this Bonneville SSEi, red, with the spoiler. The leather buckets, heads up display and red interior lighting are one of the many likes of this car. It is hard to find a dislike about this car but they have run across some problems with the CD player and with the ABS and Traction control computer. These have been occuring problems but otherwise nothing else.  Just minor computer problems. Driving this vehicle is awesome. You think a 4 door sedan would have minor acceleration. But with the 3.8 V-6 supercharger it really boots down the highway and passing power is where its at! One glance of the boost gauge and you'll know your flying. I recommend this vehicle for a family or for someone who wants almost a sedan sports car. With all the interior functions its like an airplane.
I highly recommend the Bonneville SSEi.<br><br>
