            I was looking for an SUV, and after having rented Jeep Cherokees, I was sure I wanted one a bit smaller, since I am short and I really didn't need the space of the larger SUV. At the Toyota dealership, the RAV4 was the first one I looked at, and fell in love with the appearance.

Since I was planning to lease, and needed a vehicle that could be delivered immediately, I looked at and test drove a new RAV4 that was on the lot. The car was loaded with every conceivable extra and I had no complaints about the appearance or options. One thing I loved was the back cargo door which opens sideways like a regular car door, rather than from bottom to top. I find this immensely easier to deal with. It also included storage bags attached to the back door, which is great, and the spare tire in a case on the back, just like the big SUVs. Surprisingly, the RAV4 has a lot of storage space in the back cargo area.

I leased this 4-door RAV4 right away. About 3 months later, I was run off a highway in Canada and into a swamp. I was wearing a seatbelt and the air bag deployed, and I was just fine. The car did not suffer any body damage other than a broken headlight. It did not lean to rollover during the skid, and the safety features worked like a charm. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a smaller SUV. It has full-time four-wheel drive.<br><br>
