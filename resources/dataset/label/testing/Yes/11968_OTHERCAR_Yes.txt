              In September of 2000 I decided to get a Pontiac Sunfire. It took me forever to find the color and the specific one I wanted. Finally after the crazy search all around I found my baby. I was a little upset over the price but I just had to get it. I saved up for this car for a little over a year. I decided to make payments of $151.00 a month. 

When I first seen my car I almost fell to the ground with joy. It was shinny cherry red. It was a two door with very nice Interior. The car was my dream. I know it's not much to other people, but since the first time I seen one I knew I had to get one. I always dreamed about driving on the highway with my hair blowing in the wind. Everything about the car was a plus. It has a great radio and cassette player, It only had 67,000 miles on it and it's a 1996. Seats 5 comfortably.

But also I need to add my down to the car. I have had it a little over a year now and have had a few problems with my baby. The first thing that I had a problem with was the passenger side seat. It would not move back or forward. I had to get this fixed about two or three times. Then I had a huge problem with my radio, It got a tape stuck in it and would not let it out. I could not even play the radio. Then the engine was making funny noises and it smelled a little funny. I got all them fixed and my baby is doing better now. She runs like a brand new sporty 2001. Well in my eyes she does :)

Now I purchased this car because from day 1 when I seen one I wanted it really bad. Its a very cute sporty looking car. They are not huge and they are not tiny. It's perfect for me in every way shape and form. I wouldn't want it any other way.
