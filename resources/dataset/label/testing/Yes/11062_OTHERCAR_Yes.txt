            The 1995 Mercury Mystique is the best car I ever owned. I have never had it to the dealer once for warranty items (except for recalls). The car now has 80,000 miles and still running strong. My vehicle has the 24 valve V-6; I'm not sure how well the 4 cylinder performs, nor do I know anything of its reliability.

The front seats are exceptionally comfortable. The rear seat is very comfortable for the under six foot crowd. The handling is superb by any standard. I have driven beamers that don't handle as well. Given the Mystique's German heritage, that's not surprising. 

All in all, I love the car, wish I had bought two. Despite some interior room drawbacks, this is a great car and Ford is making a big mistake by discontinuing this model.
