            6 months ago I had the pleasure of purchasing my 2nd Saab...the 2000 Viggen 3 door hard top.  Compared to my '93 900s UL, it is light years ahead in terms of performance, comfort, driving ability and road handling manners.  What I love most about the car is its ability to be a very civilized/technically precise ride, solid/safe cabin and at the same time, its amazing power, luxurious interior appointments, extremely comfortable sport seats and sophisticated central display unit (I have installed the Nokia cell phone hands free kit and the cd changer unit...these devices fully function with the central electronic display system). The only knock I have against the car is its space for the back seat passengers (the car critics claim this as well ... but let's face it, I'm not driving this car to become some taxi service for my in-laws).  I highly recommend this car to anyone that is interested in a European hi-performance car that expects to get a real thrill out of driving spiritedly and wants to keep coming back for more.  Those folks that wish to get transportation to only get them from A to B...please don't waste your time ... this vehicle is for someone that truly understands and appreciates technology sophistication and hi-performance horsepower with amazing torque power.
