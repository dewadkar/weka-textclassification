            I was at Best Buy looking at other digital cameras when I saw this and bought it for $89.00. I've seen other pen-cams before, but was impressed that this boasted a 1.3 megapixel CCD. It can hold in it's internal memory (if I remember correctly)40 pictures at the best resolution and a lot more (120?) at the lesser resolution. It can hold 30 seconds of video (no sound on this camera)at the best resolution or 120 seconds at the smaller size. I was quite impressed with the results after I uploaded the pictures with the USB cable. The pictures looked great on screen and printed well - especially the outdoor pictures. If you are using this inside just make sure you make the room as bright as possible. Lots of useful software also came on CD with the camera, although I have not used it all yet. The MegaCam Manager software worked fine for me. Overall, I have been elated with what I originally considered a toy, or novelty. I have shown the camera and the pictures from it to others in the office they all want one now.
