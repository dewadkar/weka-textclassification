               The 2001 pathfinder is a perfect melding of sport, luxury, and ability. I have owned this vehicle for 3 months, and so far I could not be any more pleased with the comfort and versatility this car has espoused. All of my buddies were quick to tell me what a nice &quot;truck&quot; I purchased when they first saw it. But, after just a short trip they realized that the Pathfinder's ride is very much as comfortable as a sedan of equal or greater expense. With the unique monoframe construction and nearly silent engine, I forget sometimes what power lies under the hood. The new engine delivers a ferocious 240-hp for plenty of acceleration power at high RPM and plentiful torque at low to midrange RPM for off-roading and cross-country driving.

   The SE model I own has plenty of the practical luxury features that make driving fun. First off, the Bose audio system is truly spectacular. It is obvious that it has been tailored to the acoustics of the car, delivering a quality of sound that no after market stereo can provide. The in-dash 6 CD changer is extremely convenient and has yet to skip. However, I will admit that it is rather slow to eject discs. Secondly, the two-toned gauges and steering wheel mounted cruise and audio controls are both sporty and useful. The ability to adjust the volume of the stereo and advance tracks without taking your hands off the wheel or eyes off the road is both a convenience and safety plus. Thirdly, the cloth interior and bucket seats have been very comfortable for me and passengers on long journeys. The overall look of the interior exudes class, but with a youthful touch. Best of all, everything I have just mentioned is standard. Who needs options when you have all that?!

   A friend of mine recently asked me, &quot;Don't you just like to sit back and admire your car sometimes?&quot; Of course I wouldn't admit that I don't have anything better to do, but the exterior of the Pathfinder SE with it's pipe-like step rails, titanium tinted bumpers and hubcaps, and aggressive grill do make for a eye-catching combination. The various colors Nissan offers provide many options to suit your taste or personality. I chose super black for it's slick, mysterious, and polished look. But also because I don't mind washing it once a week.

   Of course Nissan has incorporated an advanced 4x4 system to match all of the Pathfinder's engine technology. The shift on the fly 4HI is super smooth, and provides extra traction instantly when approaching a potentially slippery or rough area. The 4LO position has shown itself to be no slouch, either. This animal attacks steep hills and tears through rocky paths effortlessly. Don't be fooled. Through all the refinements, this pathfinder remains poised to take on any challenge.

   I can't say enough about what a joy it is to drive this vehicle. I have not yet even mentioned the expansive cargo area, the versatile roof rack system, or the lengthy list of safety features. (ABS, Dual airbags, crumple zones, steel side-impact beams, shock absorbing steering column...) Regardless of your age or what type of car you're in the market for, the 2001 Pathfinder deserves a serious look, and most of all a test drive. Don't just take my word for it: experience it! My advice: don't be daunted by a sticker price right off the bat. When shopping for a new car, remember to consider all of the features and perks the a vehicle offers. In what I have seen, heard, and felt so far, the Pathfinder is a great value. And with the reputation Nissan has developed in the past, I am confident my satisfaction will continue in the future.

   Whether it be cruising around town with the windows down and the radio up, taking a Sunday drive in the country, or bounding in the backwoods with the 4x4 tearing across the trails, the Pathfinder truly is something special.<br><br>
