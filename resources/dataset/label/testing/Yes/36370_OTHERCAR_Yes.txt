            I am a PROUD owner of Honda Accord that I have now had for a few years  and I have loved almost every minute of it.  I recently have had to get a few auto repairs so I am still feeling the pain from paying for it.  But, it has gone through a lot and I know that it wasn't treated the best before I got it- AND yet it has done it's job and satisfied me at the same time.  When I first bought the car, I had tons of people ask if it was new, and if it was a '99.  It is in good condition and holds its value pretty well.  I really like the room it has which allows more comfort for passengers, which is good for trips.  It also has a lot of truck space, for those who take everything but their kitchen sink on trips (like me).  If the trunk doesn't have enough space, you can put the seat down and fit a tall book self in it(when I moved, I found this out).
It can be a family car if you need it to be, but is a college students dream car, too.  It looks, runs, and feels great.  I especially love the MOON roof.  On a clear night, I love staring out at the stars and moon, when stopped at a red light of course.  It isn't the best car for those who are obsessed with speeding, taking off quick, etc.  NOT that kind of sports car-unless you fix it up that way.  I personally like my car the way it is, and recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable car that will probably last for as long as you live!
