            When my Jeep Cherokee exploded (rear differential locked) on the way to Vegas, we knew it was time for a new - REALLY new - car.  My first car was a Subaru GL which has 186K on it and still outperforms the Jeep, so I was very favorably pre-disposed to Subaru.  I looked at the Legacy and the Outback, and felt they were both small, cramped, and overpriced.  In desperation I turned to my credit union, saw a Honda dealer listed that they have a "no-haggle" deal with, and gave them a call.  After two minutes inside the Accord I knew it was the car for me.  I wanted a sedan, but one with enough room for large passengers.  I wanted something nice - comfortable details, a bit of luxury, but not outrageously expensive.  I wanted decent safety features also - ABS, airbags.  The Accord was everything I'd imagined.  The only thing the Legacy had that the Accord didn't is a safety aspect of the engine design - the Subaru's 4cyl boxer is mounted low and designed to go *under* the passenger compartment in a front-end collision.  Nice, but not enough to compensate.

We've taken several long day trips with 3 large adults in the back seat, and everyone has been comfortable.  The trunk is good sized, and a good shape also - almost square so a lot will fit in it.  I first thought the dashboard design was a little odd, with the center controls sloping pretty far back into the passenger compartment.  However, I soon realised that that space was "dead" space in my other vehicles, and the Accord's design made the controls significantly easier to reach without shifting in my seat.

One distinctive thing I particularly like is the way the headrests cant forward.  I haven't driven any other car where you could comfortably lean your head against the headrest while driving - I've always felt like my head was back to far.  The Accord's are designed (more safety) to help prevent whiplash, and the head support makes long drives a lot easier.  I rarely get shoulder tension anymore.  I like the lumbar support built-in to the driver's chair - I wish it would go a little further, and I think it would be nice to have in the front passenger chair also.

Note that the Accord is no longer a Compact car.  It's a mid-size - which makes parking in tight places challenging.  Luckily that's not a problem most places I go, and I'd rather have the extra space anyways.

Other things about it I really like:
Driver's seat adjustments - easy to tweak to get comfortable
cruise control - controls on steering wheel make it easy to use
radio controls on steering wheel.
side air bags
power remains on for approx. 10 seconds after you remove the key - for that "oops the moon roof is still open" moment
v6 power is great - my commute involves a 1000' elevation gain and the accord just eats it up.
climate control - the feature i never thought i'd love.  "set & forget"!

Things I wish it had:
Seat position memory.
day-time running lights. (i just turn on my parking lights)

Things I don't like:
the built-in antenna in the rear windshield is less-than-exceptional... of course I mostly listen to CD's.  And it does make going through the carwash a bit less stressful.
The center console is about 1/8" short of being wide enough to accomodate CD's cross-wise.  Having to put the CD's the other way means they rattle around a bit (i stuffed some extra bubble wrap in there.)


As you can see, although there are minor things I would change about this car, overall I love it.  It's exactly what I wanted - a comfortable, reliable, not-too-expensive way to get from point a to point b.
