            I bought my Saturn SL on July 9, 2001 and ever since I have owned this car, I have not experienced any trouble with it, except that I had to have all four tires replaced back in May because they were wearing out, but other than that, I have not had any problems.

When I first purchased my car, it had 39,748 miles on it and it now has 59,800 miles.  The farthest I have driven it was to Reno Nevada and this car really saves alot of gas. For a car that has a small engine, it has pretty good pick-up when driving over upgrades.  When I was driving through the grapevines while on my way to Reno, my car really kicked butts big time!   Best of all, my car is equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission!

I like the comfort of the seating because I never experience any aches or pain after a long drive, unlike my previous cars. 

The ride is very smooth, which means you don't hear too much noises while driving and I like that.

The braking system is good.  I have never had any problems with my brakes, especially, when I come to sudden stops.  My car does not fish-tail which is great.  

As for the air-conditioning, it is very good because whenever it is hot outdoors, I am able to use my air-conditioning and it cools the inside of the car very quickly.  I like that.

What is so good about the exterior of this car is that if someone happens to bump it with a shopping cart, the body does not dent like most cars you see that are made of fiber-glass body.  The exterior of this car is made of foam.  Pretty darn amazing, isn't it?  So it's like, you will never find a dent on the body, except that the hood isn't made of foam so that will dent.  

My car is equipped with a rack-and-pinion steering, but it does not bother me because I have had previous cars with that kind of steering.  

I think it is high time that American car makers make cars that are very reliable and this car I have now is absolutely reliable. 

This car was being sold for $7,900, but when I traded in my previous car, I got a $1,200 trade-in and so therefore, I only paid $7,304.  I think I am getting my money's worth for this car.

I highly recommend that people who are looking for a very good reliable car, buy the Saturn SL because it's very economical.  Not only that, but mechanical wise, it is very outstanding.  This car also makes a very practical used car because I bought mine used and I am hoping to keep this car for many more years.

If you do purchase the Saturn, good luck!
