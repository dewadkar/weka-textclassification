            I bought a Cutlass Supreme as my first car.  It was a weekend car for an elderly woman, so it found me with only 10 K miles.  I really do like this car, but it is one hassle to keep up.  It is a great car- though mine is 2 door, I can comfortable fit 5 people in it.  Not to mention, at the beginning, it did handle quite well on the roads.  Here I am 4 years later....I am also 4 alternators later.  Several (expensive) tires later.  2 antennaes later.  3 batterys later.  Countless alignments later.  You name it, it has been replaced.  It seems that everytime I go to drive the car, another warning light goes off.  This vehicle is quite nice in that it is large.  You do feel quite safe riding in it.  It handles well at higher speeds as well.  But is it worth it?  If I was able to go back and do it again, would I? The answer to that is no.  My checkbook can only handle so much.  Oh, did I say that I am having radiator problems now?  Thats the newest problem, as well as the transmission.  Have I mentioned that for the past 2 years, the car gets minimal use since I am away at school?  <br><br>
