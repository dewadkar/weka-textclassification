            The Yugo sedan is one of the toughest, most rugged and most reliable cars built. In every regard except trim, it is identical to the Cabrio convertible, reviewed here also. The hatchback makes the car very practical for loading long items, even lumber, and the rear-window wiper is an item that should be copied by other carmakers. The advisories about using only 89-octane or better fuel apply here as well, and the engine should be serviced with 10W40 or 20W40 (available at most motorcycle shops) oil, as per Yugo recommendation. Do not top off the fuel tank, as this could harm the catalytic converter. This is one terrific little car, perfect for city use but at home on the highway where it can run with the fastest of them and outhandle most. <br><br>
