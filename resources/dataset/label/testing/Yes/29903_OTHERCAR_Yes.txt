            I own a C36 AMG mercedes Benz and think it is a wonderful car. With a 3.5 liter engine, it is the smoothest ride. My model is a 96, but it is one of the originals. I suggest if you have a little extra money to spend, close to 70,000. you should look into this car. It might be a little loud, but that is because the car is so fast. It has a 0-60 in less than 6 seconds, and may i remind you this is a 4 door sedan. The car is built to perfection, and other than the cup holder, which is very brakeable i love the car. Everything is built in the thought of aerodynamics. even the leather is tight, so it doesnt keep wind back, when the windows are open. The rims, and tires are awesome, but the only problem is that, the car is not driveable in the snow. Even though this car is a C class, it is in a class of its own. My cousins who own dodge vipers, and ferraris, still call my car a mega machine. It is a sports car, for a single guy trying to pick of the hunnies, or a family car, if you dont mind foot marks all over the back of the seats. The car is extremely safe, and a wonderfull investment.<br><br>
