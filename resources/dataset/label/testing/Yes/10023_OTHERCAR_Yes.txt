<TEXT>
            I bought a brand new Kia Sephia 2000 LS about 3 months ago and i have to tell you, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER! The only down side to the Kia is that people don't have much experience with them so they are always very quick to think that they are less of a car than other economy cars. 
I love everything about my Kia, the comfort, the color, the price, the way that they treated me at the dealership... it was all fabulous. I would recommend the Kia Sephia to anyone who wants a good new car but can't afford to shell out 20k + for a ride.<br><br>
