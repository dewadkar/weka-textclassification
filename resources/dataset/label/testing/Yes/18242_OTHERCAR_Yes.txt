            I bought this car used in 1997 with 45,000 miles on it. It now has 115,000 and it still drives great.

Exterior - ok, so it's a box. But the paint has held up well. I have had problems with the door moulding coming off and having to be replaced. Other than that, it's been great.

Interior - the leather seats are cracking, despite cleaning and conditioning them. But man, are they comfortable! The back-seat room is very generous, and the power adjustment on the driver's seat is great, especially the memory feature for accomodating multiple drivers.

Engine - very powerful (I have the high-pressure turbo). No problems (knock wood) so far with the engine or the turbo. There isn't much turbo lag and passing power is ample. 

Accessories - the steering wheel had to be replaced because of faulty contacts, but that happened just prior to warranty expiration, so it was covered. The air conditioning went out around 80,000 miles and I'm told it's about a $1000 repair. Since we live in Northern California, it hasn't been an issue. But if we go anywhere warm, it wouldn't be fun.

Suspension - this is part of the car's design, I have found. Out of the factory it has a smooth, but not soft, ride. The handling is not sporty, but more what you might expect from the boxy looks. Efforts to improve the handling, such as anti-sway bars, stiffer shocks and lowered springs improve the sway, but make for a very stiff, even harsh, ride. 

Mileage - averages between 19-20 in mixed city/highway use.

All in all, though, it's a great car. The sound system is wonderful and overall I love it.
