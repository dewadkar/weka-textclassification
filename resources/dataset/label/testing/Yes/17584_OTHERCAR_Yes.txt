            I love having the extended cab, but I hate the fact that the back seats are VERY uncomfortable.

I love having a truck, but I hate that it is so low to the ground that I can't use it like a truck.

I love that this is the PERFECT car for someone who is short because the seat is low to the ground and the pedals are in a very comfortable position.  I hate that no one else can drive her because their knees are crushed to their chest.

I love having a bed to throw things in, but I hate not being able to turn a corner without screeching my tires.

All in all, this is the perfect car for someone who is just like me, shorter, and always has something to throw in the back.  It is very reliable, I have never had a problem with it.
