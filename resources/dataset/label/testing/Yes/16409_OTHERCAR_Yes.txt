            This is my second digital camera.  I paid about $300 for it online.  It is now selling for around $400 in stores, so I suggest you use mysimon.com and look for a deal online.  Just make sure you read reviews of the online retailer before buying!!  

I had a Sony Mavica FD-88, but after 2 years of light usage, the floppy drive wore out.  I am planning to get it fixed and sell it, but wanted a second camera.  I wanted a new camera that used Compact Flash cards.  Inserting a new floppy disk every 4 pictures in high-res mode was getting old.  Besides, who needs the hassle of something with moving parts so prone to breakage?

In shopping for a digital camera, you have several choices of media:  memory sticks, mini CD-R's, floppy disks, and Compact flash.  The Nikon uses Compact flash (CF).  Why not get a camera that uses memory sticks?  Well, they are proprietary and expensive, that's why.  It's better to get media that can be made by anyone to ensure price competition.  I already knew firsthand the pitfalls of floppy disks, and frankly I didn't want another Sony camera, so the CD-R's were out.  

The Coolpix came with 8 MB of Compact Flash.  That is not enough if you are taking high quality pictures.  It will only hold 8 of the highest quality pictures.  I bought a Mr. Flash 128 MB CF card for about $50 online.  This is NOT one of the cards recommended by Nikon, but it was very cheap.  It does work, but the camera is slower than with the 8 MB card.  I am not sure if this is due only to the size of the card, or to the brand, or both.  So keep that in mind when reading my comments about the speed of the camera.  I have plans to purchase a "recommended" card in the future; I'll update the review when I do.

The camera is made of silver colored plastic, so it is much lighter than many of its competitors.  It is small, but fat.  Claims that it fits in your shirt pocket are misleading.  It fits in your shirt pocket like a tennis ball.  You'll look silly with it sticking out so far.  I usually use the ultra-teeny case to wear it on my shoulder.

So why buy a digital camera?  My husband and I used our first one to make our website (it has hundreds of pictures of our dogs).  The resolution of the Nikon makes it suitable for prints, not just pictures viewed on a computer monitor.  It doesn't make photo quality 8x10's, though (you need 6-8 megapixels to do that).  5x7 is about as good as it gets.  We have an HP Deskjet 832, by the way, which is not the limiting factor in print quality.  It's the camera.  Anyway, I want the camera to take pictures of my patients, their X-rays, and stuff like that (I'm in veterinary school).  So, the macro feature was very important to me.

The macro (close-up) capabilities of this camera are great.  I have a friend in vet school who has a Canon S110, and we often take macro pics of the same thing.  Hers just don't come out as good.  The Nikon also takes pictures of X-rays and text well.  The X-ray thing might not interest you, but you can take a photo of text if you don't have a copier available and refer to it later.  I use this for medical records so I don't have to write everything down.

The problem with this camera is the speed of startup and focusing on moving objects.  Startup takes a LOOONG time with this large memory card, and so does waking the camera up from sleep mode.  You may miss your shot while the camera gets ready.  Also, if you are trying to take a picture of a moving subject (a puppy, for example), good luck!!  The camera has trouble focusing if the subject is moving, and you may hold down the shutter release for several seconds before the camera takes the photo.  It may end up being a picture of something blurry, or an empty space where the subject was.  But don't get too discouraged.  This seems to be a problem with many digital cameras, if not all of them.  The Mavica had the same problem, and so does my friend's Canon.  The autofocus just doesn't like a moving subject.  Maybe it is because of the low ISO equivalent of the digital camera.  I have tried to get used to it, and realize that a moving subject may take several shots to capture.  But at least you know what the picture looks like so you can try again while you have the subject.  With a traditional camera, you wouldn't know until you got the film developed.

The problem another reviewer mentioned about viewing vertical shots is real.  The LCD screen wasn't designed to be viewed sideways, and some lines are present if you look at it this way.  It is only a real problem in viewing the shots, not in taking them, though.  It makes it harder to tell if the picture you've taken is in focus.

I use the camera on auto mode, or with the flash off in macro mode, most of the time.  The wheel that lets you choose other settings has not been something I've needed to use.  The camera is basically point and shoot.  If you enjoy playing with F stop and shutter speed and filters, this is not the camera for you.  In fact, if you are a photographer at heart, I'd steer clear of any but the most expensive professional digital cameras.  But owning a point and shoot camera isn't the worst thing in the world!  It's actually pretty convenient.  

I haven't used the software that came with the camera since Windows XP does everything for you.  The USB cable is very convenient compared to the floppies of the Mavica, though!  The camera battery has to be charged to put the pictures on your computer unless you buy a stand alone setup for the CF card, though.  Ah, the battery.  You must remove it from the camera to charge it.  Not a problem, but the camera does lose its settings after a few hours.  Then, the "time not set" icon blinks at you on the LCD screen.  This could potentially be like the VCR clock that always blinks 12:00...

Finally, the LCD screen is nice because it's covered in plastic.  Other cameras that don't have a coating over the LCD get thumbprints on them.  Just check out the display cameras at Best Buy or somewhere.  Trust me, you want one where the fingerprints wipe off!

The Nikon Coolpix 775 is a good digital camera for most uses.  Don't get it if you are planning on taking mostly action shots.  Do get it if you want mostly stills and closeups of people, places, etc.  It is a point and shoot style camera that does the thinking for you.
