            The 2000 Plymouth Neon is a disgrace!  My best friend recently purchased one for $13,000.  All that was standard in that price was a radio and cassette player.  If you ask me, that is a rip off!  Now, these cars may be cute and sporty, but they are death traps!  I was riding with my friend in her new Neon when we encountered another vehicle.  We were turning out of a parking lot and broad sided them going about 3 miles per hour.  Their car was just scratched, but as for the Neon... the entire front bumper was trashed.  And we were only going 3 miles per hour mind you!  And while this &quot;collision&quot; occurred, our air bags didn't even inflate!  But our bumper fell off.  The make the situation worse, we discovered that all that was inside the front bumper to &quot;protect&quot; us in such collisions, was Styrofoam!  That is really comforting, isn't it?  So, to sum the story up, we got into a frontal collision going under 5 miles per hour, our airbags didn't inflate, and the bumper had Styrofoam in it.  My suggestion to anybody thinking about buying a Neon is:                 DON&quot;T DO IT!!!<br><br>
