            I bought a Z-34 1995 Monte Carlo, and just like most people I see in these reviews, I thought it was a great car.  In all reality, it is a very nice car for short, fast rides, but most people want a car for getting groceries and long trips.  If that is what you are looking for, this is not the car for you.  This vehicle is cramped in the back seat and very, very difficult to get in and out of.  My grandmother cannot go anywhere with me and my wife as the back seat is impossible and the front seat messes her hips up!  That is not my definition of a comfortable ride!  You want a car that handles poorly on snow?  Hook up a powerful engine to the front tires of a long wheel base car, and then make it lightweight for speed.  I think you can see the problems you will have if you life in a snowy environment!

The particular car that I had had several problems, as well.  the door never did seal right and water leaked into the car during rainstorms.  When I went to an authorized dealer to fix that, they told me that it was a problem with the Monte Carlos, and it was very difficult if not impossible to fix.  The seatbelt would catch and be difficult to pull out, and the automatic locks failed after about 4 months.  The only way to unlock the door was with a key, as the solenoid that drives them was too small for the job!

The biggest problem with the Monte Carlo, however, is that the resale value goes down, down, down!  The car that I bought had monthly payments of $400 and the value, according to the online NADA book, was going down faster than that!  I was only driving about 1000 miles a month, so that is really ridiculous!  Bottom line, this is a fast car which is not too comfortable and will be worth next to nothing when you try to trade it in, so unless you are in love with the car, plan to keep it forever, and dont care about resale, do not buy this car!<br><br>
