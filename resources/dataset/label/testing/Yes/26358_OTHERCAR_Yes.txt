            We purchased our Jimmy when we found out I was pregnant with our first child (between 2 pickups and 3 motorcycles we didn't have a back seat to put the car seat in!).  We looked at Chevy Tahoes and Dodge Durangos, which we really liked, but we just couldn't bring ourselves to pay that much for a vehicle.  The Jimmy is smaller than these other two vehicles, but I'm actually more comfortable with the size.  

Go for leather seats if you pick the Jimmy!  This little extra luxury sure does a lot for the vehicle's looks and the feel of the seats.  

My only complaint about driving the Jimmy is that it feels a little squirrely in strong winds.  It's not bad enough that you'll get blown off the road, but you can feel gusts of wind pushing against you.  

Don't get this vehicle if you have a large family or frequently go places with more than one other couple.  You can only seat 5 adults comfortably (and safely) - or 4 adults and one car seat!  

I love the keyless entry (though of course this isn't exclusive to the Jimmy) and the SCV (speed controlled volume) -- when this is turned on, the radio automatically gets louder as your speed increases. I also appreciate the temperature and direction readout, and the sunglasses compartment overhead.  

The gas mileage (19-21 mpg) isn't as good as I would like but it's better than the larger SUVs.
