                 I purchased a 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier RS in 1997.  I purchased this car because a friend of mine was selling it and when I test drove it I was really impressed.  The Cavalier is a very smooth ride which provides comfort with its nice car seats.
     The Cavalier that I own came with am/fm stereo with cassette player, air conditioning, automatic door locks, rear defrost, reclining front seats, and drink holders.  I have really enjoyed this car because it is very spacious on the inside but compact on the out.  I have owned previous vehicles and some of them have small trunks that make it hard to travel with a lot of items, but not this car, it has a very large trunk.
    The inside interior has held up nicely and this car hasn't cost me a fortune in fuel.  I have not had to do a lot of maintenance to the car (which now has 143,823 miles) but there have been some small repairs that are typical of all cars after mileage is high.  One thing that has been a problem is the brakes on this car wear out very quickly.  Since I have owned this car, I have had to have the brakes worked on four times.  Another item that this car does not feature is intermittent windshield wipers which I find very useful in small rain showers.
   Overall, I am pleased with my Cavalier and would recommend it to people who would like to purchase an affordable yet good quality vehicle.  I do not regret my purchase.  By the way, one thing that I did forget to mention is that I have had a problem with the trunk leaking ever since I got the car, and have many friends with Cavaliers that have had the same problem.<br><br>
