            Around April of 2002, my sister in law was looking for a vehicle for herself (and family).  Like my wife (her sister) and I, she prefers a manual transmission, which is getting very hard to find here in the US. 

After some searching and testing of SUVs and minivans, I suggested the XL-7, and we had a winner.  She got her XL-7 Touring for around $20,500 with good financing, figure around $23k out the door with an extended warranty.
She now has around 12,000 miles on it, with zero flaws or defects.

A few months later, with the new 2003 XL-7 coming with a revised interior, I bought a leftover 2002 XL-7 Plus model for my own family.  We paid only $18,000 for it brand new, and by now Suzuki had added a 100,000 mile powertrain warranty!  So far, at 2 months and 3000 miles, we've had zero problems or defects, and 

Coming from the world of German cars, I find the XL-7 to be a bit underpowered and soft for my taste, but that's just me.  For a daily driver for my wife to get around with the kids and still have room for grandparents or friends to ride along, there is nothing like the XL-7.

I won't rehash the reviews posted, just to emphasize that this is a safe, quality made vehicle that I expect to be as reliable as a sewing machine.

Since I like to tinker with cars, I've already made some changes to mine.  I replaced the stock tires which are just about adequate for year round use with a set of Nokian Hakkapellitta WRs in the same size (this is an odd size tire for an SUV by the way).  The XL-7 has done fantastic in the snow this winter, even when it's in 2WD.

I find the stock horns to be very typically "japanese" and wimpy, so I replaced them with a set of Hella Supertones.
If not already equipped with one, a Clarion 6 disc changer can be added for around $150, and I plan on upgrading the front speakers to MB Quarts.  The radio reception is phenomenal, by the way.

I usually upgrade the headlights on my vehicles as we get inferior lights here in the US, but the Suzuki already has euro-spec (ecode) headlights with an extremely sharp pattern.  I did upgrade the bulbs to slightly better ones (Jahn Superblue) but otherwise they are great.  I do not yet have foglights though my sister in law's has them and they are very good too.

At some point I would like to stiffen the suspension up a bit so it doesn't lean so much when cornering at speed, and I've identified shocks from Koni and Bilstein that should do the job.  

Some of us are working to make the rear wiper intermittent, but that's just gravy.

I'll update this review as ownership of both sisters' XL7s continues :)

*** One year update on our XL-7, about 18 months on my sister in law's.  Both trucks continue to please with no problems, and have had only one defect - the keyless entry system stopped working and had to be replaced (there is a TSB out on this).  MPGs continue to hover in the high teens to low 20s depending on who is driving.  Tire wear is a little high and I definitely recommend tire rotation on a regular basis.  Bottom line - both primary owners love their XL-7s and have no desire to replace them.
