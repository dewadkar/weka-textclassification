            As a mother of three, there are always extra kids to tote to the endless activities children are involved in.  The comfort of the seats is unsurpassed.  The ride is smooth and the van handles like you're driving a sporty sedan.  The kids love the headphone option for the rear seats giving mom and dad a chance to communicate with each other for a change.
We took a road trip from Oregon to Disneyland and everyone was comfortable!! This is our second Quest, we traded in a 1993 GXE and will get another Quest when this one has served it's time.<br><br>
