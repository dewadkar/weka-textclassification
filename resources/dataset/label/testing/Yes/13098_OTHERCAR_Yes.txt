            This is the for the EX V6 Coupe...

Why did I buy this vehicle?
-  Well, I used to drive a Honda Del Sol, but I moved to Seattle so had little need for a convertible and more need for a car that was very reliable and comfortable to sit in for over an hour during traffic. The other car I looked at was the Toyota Solara. The only problem with the Solara was that the steering felt too vague for my taste and it cost more money. The Accord seemed like the sensible decision.

Love...
The power seats, the superb leather interior, the quietness of the engine, the refined quality of it all. Large trunk space is a big boost. And I love opening the trunk with the keyring remote control. Also, love the air climate control, the electric sunroof and windows, the walnut trim interior and the sunglasses storage unit about the rear-view mirror.
The amazing stopping power is another thing you appreciate about this car after owning it for a while.

Hate...
It's hard to really hate anything about this car, it does everything well. So, hate is a strong word, these are just things that I think could be improved upon. The engine is fabulous, a 3 liter V6 with more than enough power for most people (200bhp) with reasonable fuel economy, but it's just not gutsy enough for my liking. An engine like this should never feel like it's straining, but to me it does. It might just be because of the automatic transmission, perhaps different gear ratios would help, or a sport mode.
The stereo system could have been improved upon. There's just not enough power. This would be a relatively cheap fix.
I wish it came with larger wheels, even on the EX V6, they just don't seem to fill the arches sufficiently.
And finally, the styling of the rear end, it's a totally personal thing, but to me it seems like my car has a big butt.

What is it like to drive this car?
It's a good drive, you're never surprised by what the car is going to do, it's sure footed and agile. And very, very bland. Also, somebody else mentioned that you get a lot of tire squeal, with which I agree. The braking system is very good, and I've caught myself by surprise sometimes when I managed to stop the car so controllably while travelling at speed.
I believe the EX V6 has disk brakes all round. It's powerful enough to bemuse a few people on the freeway, when you kick down and accelerate to overtake, safely and quickly. I drove mine from Seattle to LA through some of the worst rain storms I've ever seen, and the car itself never faultered. It's too well made to ever freak you out.

Who should buy this vehicle?
This car is great for anyone, except those who value looks and prestige more than form and function. Those people who enjoy driving cars, would probably be better of with something else. But if you want a reasonably good looking car, with reasonable power and handling, and rock solid construction, then this is the car for you.

I'm still going to keep my car, it doesn't suit my personality, but at least one of us has to be dependable.<br><br>
