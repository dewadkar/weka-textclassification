            Last year when my lease was up on my '98 Grand Cherokee, we were going to replace it w/ none other a 2002 Grand Cher but the dealer tried to screw us.  We ended up going to the car show and saw the Jaguar X-type.  We had seen billboards and commercials for it. When we saw it at the show we immediately fell in love w/ it.  It was so beautiful. We went to the dealer in town and put our name on the waiting list since it wasn't coming out until late July.  It finally arrived towards the end of Aug - it got held up at the port.  The salesman was so nice.  We've had it almost a year now and had minor problems but the dealer has fixed them all.  The gas reading sometimes doesn't show full.  Took it and dealer fixed it.  The trunk was not closing correctly even if you tried to slam it shut.  I forget if it was the trunk latch or the escape pulley that kept getting caught not allowing trunk to shut.  It is funny b/c I just read a review by someone and they said they had the dealer throw in maintenance but it is included - every 10,000 miles it gets serviced.  It is up to you if you want to do 5,000.  The newest problem we are having is the same as in another review a noise coming from the driver's side.  It sort of sounds like suspension but not sure.  Have to bring it in for 10,000 mile service so will take up the matter then.  Other than that I love the car.  It handles curves really well.  It has a lot of pep.  I like the look.  It is more for younger people not like Jag's old image - old people.   I love the color and interior.  I wish people would stop banging my doors.  The door guards do work.  I'm upset w/ the scratches from these rude people!
The dealer is constantly calling to remind us of service and sending letters.  They call and send surveys after getting service too.  We also got a call from leasing corp to find out if we had any questions about lease now that we are approaching are one year anniversary.
The back seat is a little small but it is ok. Like the fact that it has AWD.  Don't need SUV (don't get me wrong we loved our 3 Grand Cher but was time for change.) 
No complaints so far.  We did lease just in case we ran into major problems.  I see a ton on the road now.  When we first got car we got a lot of double takes and people asking how we like the car.
Hope this had help.
