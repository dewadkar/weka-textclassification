            The Honda CRV ranks second to the Nissan Xterra.  I love Hondas and if it were a car that I was buying it would definitely be a Honda.  But the other day I drove the Nissan Xterra and the CRV could not compare.  As of right now I am driving a 1997 Honda civic.  And I love it.  This civic has been through hell and back and is still working great.  I do feel bad though for who ever gets it after me because it has been in two accidents and should have been totaled. If you want a car that is reliable for infinity buy a HONDA!  <br><br>
