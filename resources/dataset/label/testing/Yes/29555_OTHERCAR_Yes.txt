            Honda Passport 2002

A Passing Grade

In the sport utility vehicle race the competition to captivate consumers is fierce. Honda is a late comer in this market and they are trying to lure new customer from their competitors.

The Passport is a nice SUV, it is very well equipped the problem is that it is more about looks than being a true working SUV. If you do not intend to do much off-roading and just want to be like the Jones and have a SUV in front of your house than why not test-drive a Honda Passport.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Passport is definitely one of the most fully equipped SUV in its class; it comes with a very long list of standard equipment. I believe that this is part of Honda&#146s strategy to lure customer away from competitors like Ford, Jeep, Dodge and Nissan.

Looking at a Passport you will have the choice between a 4-wheel drive and a 2-wheel drive, the model I test drove is the EX 4-wheel drive with the optional luxury package added so the rest of this review will concentrate on this model

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:  

The Honda Passport is very well equipped and the interior is comfortable. The seats were leather and part of the luxury optional package. From the driver&#146s position you have an excellent all around vision, the side view mirrors are adequate as long as you do not intend to pull a trailer, if you do you will have to add larger mirrors.

Behind the steering wheel a driver can not feel to be overwhelmed by he quantity of gauges and control knobs and it will take some time to get adapted to it.

The Honda Passport EX has an extended list of standard equipment. It comes with air conditioning, power windows, dual power heated mirrors, power locks, tilt steering with variable assist, AM/FM cassette radio with digital clock, tinted glass, rear window defroster, halogen headlights, luggage rack, power outlets, 60/40 rear seat assembly, power/remote tailgate, rear window wiper, a moon roof, a power rear seat privacy glass and wood grain interior trim.

The luxury package will add, body side molding, leather seats and door panels, plus a CD player.     
  
As you can see it is a very complete vehicle when it comes to standard features.

As for head and legroom the front seat driver and passenger will be spoiled, for the rear seat the legroom is at a little tight.

The exterior:

The exterior of the Passport is as you would expect from a SUV at the same time that it is stylish it will have a rugged look to the exterior body.

The side view mirrors it come equipped with are large enough to pull a small trailer but if you intend to pull a larger trailer, you will have to add bigger mirrors. 

The curb weight of the Honda passport is 4088 pounds and the towing capacity is 3500 pounds and can be increased to 4500 pounds.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Honda Passport I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 3.2-liter, DOHC V-6 that will 205 horsepower at 5400 RPM.
Transmission: A 5-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS.
Safety: Dual front airbags.
            Child safety locks.
            Remote keyless entry.
           Air filtration system.
           Child safety seat anchors.
           Energy absorbing steering column.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Honda Passport EX 2002 is a very good vehicle to drive on the highway, it is a little big too make driving within city street a breeze but still can be done with a little practice. 

I believe it does not have sufficient power and durability to be taken off road.
