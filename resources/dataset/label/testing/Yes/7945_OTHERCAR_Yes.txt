            The Jeep Wrangler is the classic epitome of the 4x4 vehicle.  The descendant of the Willys CJ, the Wrangler is now a nice, refined off-roader with interior kudos and on-road capability.  THe Wrangler is simply the best off-roader you can get for the price.  It has a &quot;smart&quot; Jeep-designed 4WD system, and the vehicle itself is compact and lightwieght, making it ideal for just about any off-road situation.  It also has classic image appeal.  It's a &quot;cool&quot; vehicle, no matter who's driving it or what the situation is.  It's probably the cheapest chick-magnet convertible you can get, but at the same time, you can smoke others in heavier trucks and SUV's in most situations.  Get a Jeep.  It's the only way to go.<br><br>
