            After being burned by the Polaroid 320, I had had enough of cheap digital cameras for a while.  Then while walking though Wal-Mart I spotted the Polaroid 640.  The price was right (between $60 and $80) if I remember correctly and this one seemed to have more features than the 320.  The 640 had a flash which was a big improvement on the 320 as well as having a preview screen on the back.  So I bought it.  

I've been very happy so far.  The 640 has a resolution of 640x800 or you can drop it down to 320x400 if you want to take more pictures.  The thing is, this camera takes much better 320x400 photos than the 320 did.  The 640 also uses standard batteries which is a plus but it also came with an AC adapter so you don't have to use the batteries while you're downloading your pictures.  

While the quality of the pictures isn't up there with more expensive cameras and you probably wouldn't want to trust it with important picture taking duties, it does just fine for casual use.  I've taken pictures of our animals, friends and items I've sold on eBay.  

I do have a couple complaints.  Sometimes it's difficult to get a good picture with the flash.  Even when you put the camera on Auto for the flash you still get too much flash at times.  Secondly while it's nice that you can review the picture you've taken, you cannot delete shots at random.  It's first in, last out.  You can only delete the most recent photo.  This hasn't been a problem but it would be nice to be able to delete picture without having to delete every picture taken after it.
