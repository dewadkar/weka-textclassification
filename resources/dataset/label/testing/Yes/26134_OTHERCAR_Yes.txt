            Okay, so I bought this vehicle when I was broke and after my ex husband turned my previous car (Mercury Tracer) into a high maintenance hunk of junk.  Sorry all Ford Motor products, you'll never see me again!

I did as much research as I could on the Sonata, comparing it to other cars I thought I would like to own, which included the all famous Camry, Civic, and even the Stratus.  I really didn't have Camry or Stratus money (or Accord), and I wanted the car to be little bigger than the Civic to accommodate my little boy better.  The Sonata really just LOOKED so pretty to me I decided to see what it was all about, and it was very comparable to the Camry.  Of course, its cheaper than the Camry too.  

I have now owned it for more than 6 months, and I think I couldn't have done better.  Even though it doesn't have the Toyota name behind it, it has the few little things in it that my Tracer didn't which make all the difference.  I understand that I moved up from a smallish car to a mid size, but I had no idea that cars could actually be so quiet or have a smooth ride.  For half a second I thought I was driving a car that I didn't think worthy of me!

But to go through important points concerning the car itself:
NOISE: very quiet, occassionally I hear a little squeak here or there, but its road related more often than not.
HANDLING: not a stiff ride, maybe a little looser than I'm used to, but very comfortable. 
POWER: Could use a little more pick up.  I thought my car had more HP than it actually does (went down about 20 HP in the Base V6).  Hyundai said it was a mistake, and for their mistake I got my limited warranty extended an additional year.
SPACE: I feel like I have enough space, maybe a little more than needed.  Certainly my 2 yr old has enough space for his toys and throwing!  I felt cramped at times in my Tracer, but being 5'8" in the Sonata is almost relaxing.
SPECIAL FEATURES: I don't have many of those, I think having power windows and a CD player is pretty special though.  I compare it to my Tracer a lot, which I shouldn't do, because my Tracer was 1994 car, and the most basic car ever.  Things like a light in the glove box and ash tray make me feel like kissing Mr. Hyundai.
ANYTHING ELSE: The radio is good, but I think it should tune down to 87.7, since I can get a local station there.  It tunes down to 87.9.  That kind of upsets me.  The cup holder leaves more to be desired too, since two 20 oz. cups are pretty uncomfortable in them together.  A little more pick would be nice at times, but hey, if I wanted a super Maxima, I would have saved up enough money for that.

All in all, I think its a great car, low maintenance, decent mileage (especially HWY!), a great interior and exterior plus the Hyundai Company seems to really keep up with their car buyers.  I think because they are just starting to break in to the car market with sales that can cause competition, they want to make sure they have a good record.  They've been around for quite a while actually, but have become rather popular recently.
