            I've had my Avalanche for 7 months now. The more I drive it, the less likely I am to drive anything else. 

I have the Z66, with 2 wheel drive and the 5.7 liter V8. It came with a one year subscription to Onstar, leather seats, heavy duty floor mats, am/fm/cd player, amazing electric seats (with heaters built in), computerized controls for everything, including oil change intervals.

I love the appearance of my truck. There's never a shortage of people who want a ride in it. It rides like a cloud down the highway. There are storage compartments on each side of the truck bed with plenty of room for average people, although these probably are not suitable for contractors. The bed covers do keep the bed dry and the bed liner has anti skid characteristics that do keep things from sliding around back there. I have even had a couple of occasions to take mine off-road and it handled very well - even though it only has two wheel drive.

The interior is comfortable and roomy. It will carry 5 adults comfortably. It also has enough storage that I carry way too much stuff around with me.

I was concerned about reliability and ordered the 70,000 mile warranty. So far (at 26,000 miles) I've not had any occasion to use the warranty.

A word about Onstar. I bought my truck new and the Onstar feature, which requires a subscription, came with one year for free. I understand that there are various levels of service you can get. I will renew my basic subscription; I've locked my keys in the truck twice and Onstar was able to unlock the truck in both instances within 5 minutes with only a short phone call. This feature has a panic button that will automatically dispatch emergency services if you ever need it. And Onstar can track the location of your vehicle if it's stolen.

I never thought I'd own a vehicle with all the features this one has. I absolutely love mine.

I will share a few of the things that I wish were different. Please don't misconstrue this short list - the benefits of this vehicle far outweigh these minor obstacles.

First, while the bed covers do keep things dry and add to the overall appearance of the vehicle - they are inconvenient to remove and store. There's a big canvas bag that you can store them in, but when in storage they take up a fair amount of space in the bed. Assuming you took them off to carry something in the bed, you'll be a little disappointed in the amount of room back there.

Second, this vehicle does not have a lot of excess power. I have found it adequate in all ways, but you can't punch it and get the same acceleration you'll find on lighter trucks.

Overall, I am a very satisfied driver of a 2002 Chevy Avalanche. If you're looking for a feature laden, very comfortable vehicle with class and style; I highly recommend it.
