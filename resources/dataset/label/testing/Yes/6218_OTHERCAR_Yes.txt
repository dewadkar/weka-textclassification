                 I recently purchased a 2000 Nissan frontier crew cab.  I have been waiting for this truck for about ten years, I first saw a four door Nissan long ago and decided that this would be my next truck!  To my surprise I learned that this truck was not available in the states!!  So I gave up on my dream.  Just about two years ago, when the Frontier was first introduced, I saw a spy photo of the new crew cab in a favorite magazine of mine and all my dreams were re-kindled.  Soon after I learned that this truck WOULD be available here.  I decided right then and there that I would own one soon.

     I was one of the first in my area to own one, back in July, and I still get stares an comments every where I drive it!   Mine is a SE-V6
2-wheel drive, 5-speed.  In my opinion the SE is the only way to go, with the color matched bumper and fender flares.  I also strongly recommend the 
5-speed to plant the 3.3L to the ground, it makes it much more fun to drive.

     With this being my third Nissan, I can honestly say that nothing comes close in reliability and bang-for-your-buck!  This truck rides like a car and handles better than I ever Immagined.  With plenty of room in front and lots of kid room in back, my 5-year-old and my 2 month old love it too.  I have heard plenty of people say this is a &quot;mom truck&quot;, and them may be right, but this dad loves it too!

     Now for a couple of bad points.  The back doors could be designed to open just a little more, it can be a little difficult to put a carseat in the back.  I also have realized that since this truck is built on a 4 X 4 chassis, it would be very difficult to lower down to a more respectable height without major modifications.  I know this is not a concern to 95% of potential buyers, but to the rest of us this is a major drawback. one last problem, gas milage! Nissan please work on this in the future!
