                 The Chevy Metro is a good car in some ways, and not so good in other ways.  Overall, it's an okay car, but that may not satisfy you if some of the individual negatives are more than you can stand.  In my case, that's true, and that's why I'd never own one.  Still, the car does have its good points, and I'll present the good and the bad below.

     I've rented the '99 Chevy Metro for several months, mostly as a replacement for my current car, a '93 Ford Tempo, while it was in various repair shops for extensive renovations.  So while I don't own a Metro, I've had lots of driving experience in one.  First, the good points.  

     The car has excellent fuel economy; it may be the most economical American car made.  I easily averaged over 40 miles per gallon in a mix of expressway and city driving, with the expressway driving often being low speed stop-and-go traffic.  

     Considering the car's light weight, it is reasonably stable in cross winds, and doesn't shake too badly when you pass a semi' going the opposite direction you are at high speed.  Again, despite the light weight, the ride isn't too bad, though you'll never believe the cabin is isolated from either road feel or road noise.

     The car's various interior features are generally good; visibility of the few gauges on the dashboard is clear and unobstructed, and the controls for the windshield wiper, lights, horn, radio, etc., are easy to reach and use.

     Last, the engine's power isn't too bad despite its tiny size and the power accessories it carries.  In fact, the engine does rather well, even with the air-conditioning on.  You can even get stuck in heavy traffic on a hot summer day, and the car won't overheat.

     Now, the bad points.  Once more, the car's weight bears mentioning.  Because it's so light, and lots of plastic is used in the car's construction, you get lots of creaks, rattles, and squeaks while driving.  Even a brand new Metro can have an annoying selection of squeaks, and that can get on my nerves.  

     Interior room is cramped, even for the driver.  Leg and head room aren't so bad, but adequate side room for my left elbow is absent.  Unless I keep my left arm perfectly still, sooner or later I'll bump my elbow hard against the driver's door.  I hate that!  Just a couple more inches there would make all the difference.  While I did say head room isn't so bad, it's still just enough; I notice my hair grazes the fabric on the roof of the car when I sit up straight.

     Interior noise can be quite loud, especially when the engine is under heavy load, like when you're trying to pass a semi' at high speed, merge into high speed traffic from an entrance ramp, or make an aggressive, high speed lane change.  On the same hand, though acceleration is all right in most instances, the Metro does not respond well in situations where you need to accelerate quickly from a moderate to a high speed.  That can make the previously mentioned situations more exciting than they have to be.

     While fuel economy is great, the Metro's gas tank is too small.  I don't see any reason why it couldn't have a gas tank holding four or five more gallons than it does.  Admittedly, the car's range is okay with its current gas tank, but a car that gets such good fuel economy would be even better with a large gas tank for extended highway cruising.

     Last, the Metro's interior is pretty plain.  Nobody will think it was patterned after Cadillac, Jaguar, or even Buick.  It's bargain basement Americana, complete with jarring color combinations, and indestructible synthetic materials.

     Thinking about buying a Metro?  Do what I did (though for a different reason); rent one first.  They're cheap, you can get one for a few days for under $40, and a week's rental can be had for a little over $100.  That's a small price to pay to get to know this car well before signing on the dotted line.
