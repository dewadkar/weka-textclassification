            I bought the vehicle because of the looks,long wheel base,head room as I am 6'4&quot; 250 lbs and have plenty of leg room.This truck reminds me of a successful business mans truck.My little gas sipping v6 also pulls a huge amount of weight without squatting down and acting squirrelly.The drawbacks are #1 anti lock brakes,In the owners manual it states the anti lock brake system may be susceptible to interference caused by high output radio transmissions.High output radio transmissions are caused by simple phone calls.Transmitting equipment at any airport as well as satellite phone equipment.A lot of people told me that anti lock brake systems are on a different frequency,but I learned from an electronics man that frequency's bend into other ranges when they bounce off the ionosphere and back to earth.I personally experienced this interference which caused me to rear end a mini van causing less than five hundred dollars worth of damage to the mini van.To my Dodge Ram that I rear ended her with my 12 mile per hour crash cost me $4,000.00. So that huge front bumper is for looks not to protect the front end.I believe the high output radio transmissions were caused by either satellite phone systems at several businesses in the area or by the radio transmissions from nearby Craig air field.
