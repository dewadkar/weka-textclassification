            As a relative foreigner to the family sedan markets, I was not quite sure what to think about the new Chevy Prizm (formerly the Geo Prizm).  Since I detest most things GM, and dislike platform sharing and re-badging just as much, the Prizm seemed poised to draw my ire.  Surprisingly, it did not.  The Prizm is a wholly enjoyable vehicle when viewed from the buyer�s perspective.  This little gem begins life as a Toyota Corolla and is differentiated by slightly different fascias and interior details.  The mechanicals all remain decidedly Toyota, the Prizm�s main feature. From this point, I�d like to focus my comments on two areas, comfort and value.

While not a luxury sedan by any means, the Prizm possesses a �just right� level of crispness and ride damping to be pleasurable, the handling is efficient and confident, allowing the driver full use of his/her skills in any an emergency and all of the input controls has a neutral and �ready to serve� feel.  My favorite part of the Prizm is the refinement of the drivetrain.  It is smooth and crisp never sounding boomy or rough. Its peppy, but not zippy (see Acura Integra and Honda Civic).  When driving, the standard manual engages easily and without protest and does not intrude on the driving experience.  The optional automatics are a Dichotomy, the 3-speed feeling weak and buzzy (more a function of engine RPM being increased at any speed relative to the manual), while the 4-speed feels like it came from a Camry.  It is my recommendation to any buyers that they either save gas and money with the manual, or pony up for the 4-speed, as the 3-speed leaves so much to be desired in so many facets of its performance.

From a value standpoint, the Prizm is a great study.  It provides all of the necessary Toyota pluses: reliability, aesthetics, build quality, comfort, and refinement, and offers them at a lower price from the dealer (If you want my opinions on why that is, email me, I won�t bore the public with them).  In addition to the lower sticker prices at the dealerships, they also have a resale value nearly as high as the Corolla�s giving buyers much reduced depreciation costs.  Looking at the available equipment, the Prizm is a solid performer and offers a decent set of amenities without adversely affecting sticker price.

In conclusion, the Prizm is a winner because it offers buyers more for less in a highly price-competitive market, and allows the conscientious to �buy American� and still get import quality and engineering.
