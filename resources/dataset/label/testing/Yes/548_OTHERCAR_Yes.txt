            Economy cars once resembled shoe boxes, had a stiff ride and slow, noisy acceleration. The 1980s Hyundais were such cars, but that's history. Even Hyundai's 1998 entry-level Accent looks slick and is fairly sophisticated. Its all-independent suspension provides a decent ride, and acceleration generally is lively. A fair amount of tire and road noise is noticeable with the radio off, but the Accent's surpisingly roomy interior is pretty quiet.  Even the car's four-cylinder engine doesn't get too loud when pushed hard, thanks to noise-reducing roller-type rocker arms and needle bearings that minimize engine friction and noise. The 1998 Accent coupes have been slightly restyled at the front and rear for a sleeker appearance, and the sedan gets a new hood, trunk lid and headlights. Noise and vibration have been reduced from 1997 levels.
