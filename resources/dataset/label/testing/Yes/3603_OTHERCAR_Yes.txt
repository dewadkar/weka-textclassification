            The Canon PowerShot G2 has more than proven itself to be pushing the performance parameters of its well-received ancestor, the ground-breaking G1.  The combination of high 4 MB resolution with Canon's fine optics has put professional performance in the hands of those of us who can't take out a mortgage on a new D30 or D1.  While not having interchangeable lenses, the dedicated hot shoe certainly gives the camera rare versatility.  

Having sold digital cameras for years, my first love is film.  This camera has shown results at 8 x 10 that I would prefer not to admit to.  It also has a vivid color mode that's not some "cheesy" digital effect.  It mimics some of your souped-up color films on the market.  

The viewfinder, a big hit with the public on the G1, still gives you every angle, while offering superb protection of your LCD screen.  

The only negative I could think of to put in the "cons" category is the G2's larger size, but frankly as a photographer of 23 years, this thing feels like a "real" camera.  

The G2 has more whistles and bells than I can list, including movie and sound files, and is usually the first camera I grab in my camera store for business projects.
