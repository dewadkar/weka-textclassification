               The Toyota 4Runner is a nice, roomy, reliable vehicle. Mine is red, has a CD player, and a silver Toyota sign.

   Its a great SUV, and I recommend it if you want a sports utility vehicle. Great for road trips. Four seats, four wheel drive, tinted windows, and a bundle of other things. So much room for luggage and stuff.
You should buy it if you can.

   It has good excelleration, swell speed, awesome traction, and wont flip over anytime soon by itself.

   It also has a good radio, and it's pretty strong. I love the lumbar support. Feels great!

   It is also great for just riding, but it needs a lot of parking space.

   The perfect SUV by Toyota, a must buy! <br><br>
