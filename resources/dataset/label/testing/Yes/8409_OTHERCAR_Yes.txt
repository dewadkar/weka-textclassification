            I purchased several of the 600l's for work and have used them extensively along with many other fellow employees. The picture quality is extremely good, especially when you connect to a higher end color printer using bright white paper. This camera has the SLR similarities which make it very easy to capture the picture the way you intended. I used this camera for some very detailed work instructions in a manufacturing environment. Many of these photos needed to be extreme close-ups to capture the kind of detail we were looking for. The results are excellent! 
Downloading the pictures is extremely easy using the flashpath adapter.  You can usually pick one of these up for around $75. I would buy a couple of the smart media cards, recommend at least 8mb. This should be ample space for all your photography needs. I think the pictures download quicker with this method as opposed to using the cable hook-ups.
I did some extensive research on which camera to purchase since it was going to be used quite a bit in a manufacturing environment. From all the articles I read, it seemed that the Olympus 600l was at the top of the list for many of them. 
I also have been able to borrow it for some personal use and have been very happy with the results. I have printed several photos onto HP photo paper and am amazed at how great they look!
I bought them when they were first introduced at around $1200 so the lower prices today look very attractive. They have withstood much use and abuse for a year and a half now and are still working strong.
I'd recommend having two sets of rechargeable batteries, so one set can be charging while you're using the other. They burn through the batteries very quickly (just like any other digital camera)!<br><br>
