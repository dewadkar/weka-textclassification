            I have always liked Chryslers, but when looking for a vehicle this time I really had not idea what I was going to get I decided on this particular one because of it's looks, and the way it glided across the road.  I love the fact that it is very low maintenance, it's a nice looking car and the way the interior light dims slowly when you close the door, instead of just shutting off.  The car was a little high in price.  This is a car for the young as well as the young at heart, but not for a teenager.  <br><br>
