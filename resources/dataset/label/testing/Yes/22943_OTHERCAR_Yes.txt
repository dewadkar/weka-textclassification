            My husband and I bought a 1996 Accord Coupe a few months ago and we love it. We have the VTech 5-speed manual transmission and its great. We had been looking for this exact car and had not been able to find one without it having high mileage. But then the dealer called with our perfect match. Low mileage, one owner, excellent condition. We bought it that day! 

You just can't beat the dependability of a Honda.  They run forever with very little maintenance. All that we've done is have the oil changed. I never worry about the car breaking down. Several people that I know that have an Accord love it. Not only because they look great, but because they are very low maintenance and very reasonably priced! Luckily mine has low miles, but even ones with high mileage perform just as well. 

I feel like I'm in a sports car when I drive it. The acceleration and handling are great, probably too good for me. You can cruise at 90MPH with ease. Actually, it's very hard to drive the speed limit! I got my first speeding ticket in it! 

This is our road trip car. The front seats are extremely comfortable and there is plenty of leg room. We get great gas mileage and there is minimal road noise, except when we have the sunroof open. The trunk is rather large, so all of our luggage fits easily. This is one thing I didn't expect. 

One downfall this car has is the lack of room in the back seat. I guess that's what you get with the 2-door. The back seats are surprisingly comfortable though, but a little more leg room would be nice. The 4-door sedan would add some leg room, so if you need a larger back seat then go with the 4-door. 

I personally like the looks of the Coupe. And I don't have children to haul around so that's why the Coupe was my choice. This car is perfect for the person who wants a sportier car without a huge price tag and doesn't care about a smaller back seat. <br><br>
