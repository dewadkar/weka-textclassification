            I began my search for a digital camera after my old 2 megapixel camera bit the dust in a motorcycle crash. I wanted a camera that wouldn&#146t be obsolete in a few months, one that was durable, accepted lots of different media, and took great pictures. The 5050Z met all those demands, especially when it came to media flexibility. It will use 4 different types of media. SmartMedia, CompactFlash, XD, and Microdrive. The camera has two media slots. One is for smartmedia and XD, the other for compact flash and microdrive. This makes it impossible to have compact flash and microdrive or XD and smartmedia in at the same time, but you can run XD or smartmedia in one slow and compact flash and microdrive in the other. There is even a copy feature to allow you to copy pictures from one media to another. It would be a good idea to buy a large microdrive (the camera will accept a 1GB microdrive) and a smaller XD or smartmedia card. You could shoot pictures to the XD or smartmedia and copy the ones you wish to keep to the microdrive. This will help work around the fact that microdrive, despite it&#146s size, is very slow media. You can also shoot in a different media format than a friend and trade pictures on the fly by inserting his media in your camera and making copies of his pictures. Try THAT with any other camera.

The camera has several preset modes as well as some programmable ones. Everything from high action, night, portrait, outdoor, aperature, shutter, and automatic is available. You can customize just about every aspect of your picture taking from shutter speed, to apature size, to &#147film&#148 ISO, to flash brightness, saturation, white balance, and iris setting. It&#146s almost staggering what you can do with this camera. For a novice like me, it&#146s almost intimidating, but it sure is fun to play with.

Picture quality is excellent. I&#146ve had more than a few people compliment me on my picture taking ability. In reality it has nothing to do with me. I set it on automatic, point and click. Perfect pictures every time! The flash does tend to be a bit bright, but guess what? You can turn down the flash brightness for up close shots. Incredible!  Speaking of up close shots, the camera has a macro mode and a super macro mode. You can&#146t imagine how well this feature works. You can take extreme close ups (about 2 inches) of objects and get amazing detail. I took a picture of the back of a coin at full resolution. The amount of detail was amazing. It was like looking at it under a microscope. You can really get creative with this. I took a super macro picture of a leaf and when you view the picture it looks like something totally different due to the extreme close up detail. The zoom feature is pretty weak, only offering 3x zoom. I can honestly say this is the only area of the camera I think could be vastly improved. The saving grace is that you can screw on a larger zoom lens, wide angle lens, and various filters. To gain this functionality, the camera has a traditional lens cap instead of the widely used slider type on many other digital cameras. This isn&#146t a big deal in and of itself, but if you power on the camera with the lens cap in place, the lens tries to extend and impacts the lens cover. This causes the camera to beep in anger as if to say &#147remove the lens cap fool!&#148 and can&#146t do the tiny gears that extend the lens any good. The camera will also except an external flash thanks to its shoe mount. While the camera is pretty sturdy, the portion of the lens that extends out looks and feels a bit frail. I&#146ve had no problems with it, even in the harsh environment motorcycle touring. Battery life excellent and I've never ran the included rechargables down during a shooting session. After using the camera, I recharge them in the charger provided. If you do drain the batteries, the camera takes 4 standard AA batteries which I carry spares of just in case.

While I&#146m not an expert in photography, I know what looks good and what doesn&#146t. The C5050Z takes great pictures even for a point and click person like myself, yet it gives me the flexibility to expand my horizons and become a better photographer should I decide to do so.
