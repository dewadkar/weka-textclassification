            I bought this car brand new, and have had little problems.  I was motivated by its features for the value compared to other cars in 1994.

It has 98,000 miles on the 2.2 liter engine and gets an MPG of 25/29.  I had to replace the brakes at 40,000 and at 98,000 its going through a bit more oil, but otherwise have had no problems.  The car doesn't cost an arm and leg to insure and came with many features that were options on other cars, such as anti-lock brakes and air conditioning.  I am at the point that I need to re-fill the air conditioning, and fortunately, it is refillable.  The engine does have good power, albeit not a sports engine.

Overall, I have been quite pleased with the value and performance from the Beretta.  I would recommend this as a good teenager car because it still looks sporty and comes with safety features (airbags, and anti-lock brakes).<br><br>
