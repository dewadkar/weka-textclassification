            I recently leased a 2001 Honda Accord VP. What is the VP you ask? It's basically an Accord DX with some LX options and a great sticker price.

The VP has Accord DX features: a 135 hp engine (w/o the VTEC feature), black side mirrors, Dunlop SP40 tires (low end tires), no power windows, locks, or mirrors, and no cruise control, but for less money ($2,500 +) than the LX. The VP comes with A/C, special (just a different style than the DX or LX) hubcaps, automatic transmission, and a six-speaker cd/tape player. The exterior color is only available in dark green or metallic silver.

The VP gets the same gas mileage as the DX, LX, and the V6 models even with a bit smaller engine and a few less pounds. Therefore, the car maybe even a bit slower than the LX, which to many people is quite turtle-like. However, you can downshift the 4-speed automatic between 3rd and 4th with out pushing in the button on the shifter. The car also comes with rear drum (no ABS either) brakes and no rear stabilizer bar, but it still manages to handle and brake very well. If you upgrade the SP40 Dunlop tires to an "H" rated sport-performance tire, the car will handle with great ease.

The Accord is a workhorse. It only needs a minimum of 86 octane gas (which you can't find too much any more but says something about the low maintenance aspect of the Accord) and needs 5w-20 oil, which is hard to find, but helps gas mileage. Just go to your dealership.

The A/C works wonderfully and quickly. The stereo sounds great with the 6 speakers. You even get a large arm rest (which holds a lot in its two levels) with 2 cup holders and a large "cubby hole" area under the stereo to store even more. The trunk is also very large and is well organized. It has a plastic side housing for the jack, but only a donut-size spare tire under the trunk mat.

The car can fit 4 comfortably and has front airbags. The drivers seat offers no lumbar support or any other controls, just a lever for the seat back and one under the seat to move forward or back.

The mirrors, locks, and windows are not power. You must use the lever on each mirror (the mirrors also fold for car washes or tight streets) to adjust the view. The key must be used to lock the driver's door because it will not lock from the inside unless the door is closed. You must also unlock the doors manually and make sure, when you park your car, to lock all the doors. The windows must be rolled manually too, but they move with ease. The gas door locks closed and can be opened along with the trunk from the driver's seat

Overall, this car is made to last for a long time without any costly repairs. The radio antenna is even part of the rear window. Everything in this car is made for the long haul. The car is stylish and practical, and can be driven by anyone without them complaining about it too much.
