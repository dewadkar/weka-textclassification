            I've recently been car shopping <i>(After all August/September is the best time to buy a vehicle, especially close to the end of the month)</i> and no matter how many vehicles I look at I keep coming back to the Outback.  

My goals in buying a car are to purchase a vehicle that can handle the rigors of life (kids, occasional dog, vacations, commuting, etc) and not let me down -- a genuine complete package.  Thus, I'm riding the bandwagon a little bit and checking out SUV's.

The very first car I looked at was the Outback Wagon. I immediately fell in love with this vehicle.  Any individual item that another car could do better (ie. faster, cheaper) was outdone in another area by a greater margin.  I won't go into everything about the outback, but let me elaborate on what I think sets it apart from an SUV and makes it a true complete package. A &quot;SUREV&quot; if you will: A <b>S</b>port <b>U</b>tility <b>R</b>ecreation <b>E</b>verday <b>V</b>ehicle

<b>Ride</b>
I love the height of the outback. I don't feel like I am laying down on the floor (like a lot of wagons) and yet there's no jumping up to grab the steering wheel to get in -- I'm not sure how my wife managed to get into some of those typical SUV's.  Sitting inside I have plenty of room for my 210lb / 6' frame and the controls are comforatable plus <b>I have a great view of the road.</b>  I don't feel like I'm on top of the world, but I don't feel like I'm going to fall off the &quot;pedestal&quot; the other SUV's put us on.  I've been a standard shift-man all my life which is not availabe on the limited edition, but the 4-speed automatic offers lots of control.  

<b>Performance</b>
I've heard a lot of negative things from people who look at the car's 4cylinder engine on paper.  But this thing gets going very well w/ 165HP and I'm not afraid to bring those engine RPM's way up there.  More importantly you get good performance all-the time. No switching to 4WD, it's there all the time!

<b>Handling</b>
I put this thing through it's paces.  I'm don't know many people who would take a $26000 US vehicle off-road every weekend, but the dealer demo definitely got a work out.  I could do things in the Outback (including <b>doughnuts at 70KM(40+mph)</b>) that I was afraid to do in other SUV's without the smell of burning rubber on the car at the end.  I would never put myself in this situation intentionally and I may never use that ability, but my wife recently did a 540 in our Jetta @80Km(50mph) and the SUV dreams I had in my had came crashing to reality.  My Jetta's (and other regular height vehicles') muffler paid for that, but the Outback's would have been clear. &lt;BR&gt;Moreover, the power transfer on partial pavement (half gravel &amp; wet) was amazing, I could feel the difference.  <b>Very tight vehicle -- no SUV loosey goosey</b> feeling at highway speed.&lt;BR&gt;Being August I didn't test it on snow, but I'm actually excited about trying 60+mph on new snow.

<b>Suspension</b>
This is great, but I don't need to tell you how great Subaru's suspension is after &quot;roadiem&quot; did such a great, accurate job

<b>Complete package</b>
The cost of the outback appears a little high on paper, but you get what you pay for and then some on the Outback. The value is bar none.  When my Jetta dies in a few years this car has good enough mileage to be my commuting car while at the same time providing me with an exciting (as I want it to be), confidant, relaxing, 4-seasons drive.  In the meantime, I'll look forward to the weekends.<br><br>
