            I currently own a 1994 black Nissan Altima GXE.  I absolutely love it!  I was actually in the market for a sports car when I purchased my Altima a year ago, but fell in love with it right when I saw it. I didn't even have to test drive it to know that it would be my next vehicle.  It currently has 71,000 miles on it, and I have yet to have any problems with it at all.  

Not only is this car sleek, extremely comfortable, and gives a smooth ride, it's also great on gas mileage.  I get roughly 36 miles to the gallon.  My little Acura Integra doesn't even get as good of gas mileage!

Although I am single and don't have any kids, I would definitely recommend this car to someone looking for a family vehicle.  It's a 4-door and will seat 5 people easily.  There's also tons of trunk space.  But, it's great for those who are single like me, too.

Buy a Nissan Altima if you're looking for a car with the look and feel of luxury without the high price.<br><br>
