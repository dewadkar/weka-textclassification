                 This camera is awesome!!  
     I was first introduced to digital cameras by a coworker but was turned off by the need to either carry additional cables or add another drive to my PC.  When I saw this camera in a newspaper ad, I knew I had to have it.  Because of my impatience, the company paid a little more than they would have liked to, but, they have definitely gotten their money's worth out of this product.
     The company I work for is nationwide and is very e-mail orientated.  There were many times I found myself typing long e-mails trying to describe very specific details about different work related business to my management team.  Now, with the help of this little ditty, I can whip up a two or three line e-mail and attach a digital pic and blast it to them in a matter of minutes.  In the past, sending pictures would have required a trip to the one hour photo store and overnight delivery.
     I think the best selling feature of this camera is it's simplicity.
Install a 3.5&quot; floppy, aim in the general direction, shoot.  It also has all the other bells and whistles but I find it hard to comment on them because I very rarely use them.  Another feature I like about the camera is the battery.  The battery seems to hold a charge for a long time (under normal use) and re-charges pretty quickly.  The charging mechanism is very compact so it makes this package very convenient for the guys out in the field. 
     If I'm not mistaken, the company I work for has since equipt all it's field techs with the MVC FD81.    <br><br>
