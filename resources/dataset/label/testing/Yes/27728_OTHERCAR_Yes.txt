            First, I am a camera buff and love photography. When I saw the Canon Elph I fell instantly in love with this little sparkling beauty. It's all polished solid steel camera, and very small in size, too. One reason I had not gotten into digital was that I wasn't too sure of the quality of pics in the digital as opposed to film format. But this little beauty took fantastic pictures. The color rendition was very accurate, pictures were very sharp even with enlargements as large as 8x10! There aren't any fancy stuff as regards onboard camera editing. But who cares? I can do all the editing I want on my pc. Besides, it's hard to do any editing in that tiny camera with pesky keys. What I want is good pictures. If my raw material for editing is good than that's all I would want. In that, this camera is the best I have seen.

Another excellent feature of Canon Elph S-100 is that it is both PC and Macintosh compatible!  This camera also has a built in zoom. Installation of software was a breeze. When you hookup the camera to the computer through the USB port, the software automatically starts showing all the pictures in the camera. You could download them in a jiffy.

A great camera for anyone. Digital gives instant gratification and allows to mail your pictures to friends and family at no expense. 
Canon Elph S-100 gives you a very high quality pictures and it would be a camera you will tout in your pocket when you travel and of course, you will tout with pride in front of your friends and relatives who will gawk at it in amazement and admiration.

BEST GIFT FOR YOURSELF OR YOUR LOVED ONES FOR XMAS!

PLEASE RATE THE OPINION. WOULD BE A GREAT FEEDBACK!<br><br>
