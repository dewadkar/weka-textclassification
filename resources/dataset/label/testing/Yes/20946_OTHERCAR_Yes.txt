            This car has it all. It's fun to look at. It's fun to drive. Chrysler thought of so many things to make the car functional, including things like the cargo compartment with adjustable shelf, electrical outlets and grocery bag hooks. The car is extremely solid feeling and well built.

The touring suspension makes the car handle extremely well. The leather seats are well worth it. Heated seats only became available after I ordered mine, but I'm sure they're well worth it. It took me a while to get used to the location of the window switches (the middle of the dash and the back of the console)

My only complaint is minor and that's the weak door remote. Otherwise it's a fantastic car!<br><br>
