              First off let me say that Honda Accords are quite simply the best cars ever built.  Their solid construction and reliability make them far better that any other mid-sized sedan on the market.  My family owns two Accords, a '96 and a '90 which belongs to me.  The '96 is incredibly nice with leather, a cd player and a v-tech engine.  I would recommend that car if you have the extra cash.  But since i am a teenager, i had to buy a little older accord, but it isn't any less of a car.  My '90 accord holds it's own in all aspects of driving and saftey standards.  I also only had to pay $5,500 for it.  What a deal that was.  Since i purchased my car two years ago, i have had no, and i mean no problems with it.  Despite it's old age it can still get up and go with the best of them, and it's top speed is more that adequate, even for the develish teenager.(I would know i am one)  The only work I have had done on this car is the 3000 mile oil change, and the occasional tune up.  It costs me very little since i only have to fill it up ever two weeks or so due to the exceptional gas mileage.  My car gets 25-30 mpg.  I have the EX model which was the top of the line model in 1990. So it has all the bells and whistles including a power sun roof and good sound system.  So, let me conclude by saying if you are in the market for an older used car, spring for the Honda Accord, i promise you won't be dissatisfied.<br><br>
