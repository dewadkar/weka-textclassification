            This was written in collaboration with my husband.  My husband is a Sales Manager for a Ford dealership and has been with the Ford product 20 years.  Myself, I sold Ford's until I stayed home to have a family.  So, I asked him to bring one home for me to spend the day in &amp; review.

On to my opinion....
The 2000 FORD Focus is a hot little number for the money.  The Escort making it's departure soon from the market leaves way for a new fresh &amp; affordable FOCUS.  The Focus started in a European test market last year and sales are booming now here in the US.

There are 3 models.  A 3-door (ZX3), sedan and wagon all very European in styling.  In your sedan class there are three models to choose from, a LX,SE and top dog the ZTS.  Anybody who knows Ford's knows there are Comfort packages, Sport groups, Options and so on so I can't even break down all that is available on these cars in one page. 

In driving the car I found it was responsive and seating was comfortable for a small car.  The engines in the FOCUS are the same that were carried in the Escort, so newcomers don't worry about the tales that first year models are full of glitchs and recalls. Anti-lock braking is available and of course dual air bags are standard. The interior is sleek and controls are smartly placed with the stereo controls set above the climate controls.  (reasoning: we use the stereo controls ALOT and our eye glance isn't too far down to change a station)

If you go top of the line things like leather, CD, spoilers, fog lamps and tach's are available.
There are 12 colors to choose from in the different models and SANGRIA RED is HOT !!  (A spiced up version of Ford's best selling Toreador Red)
The wagon is roomier than the earlier Escort models and the ZX3 boosts a roomy hatchback.

All in all the FOCUS is on the money.  Ford has stepped up to the plate again with affordability, safety and styling.<br><br>
