            Note that, although this has been on the market for awhile, this is a new acquisition for me. It replaces a Fuji 1400 Zoom which was a better product. The design is much like a 35mm point and shoot. The lens cover is a built-in sliding type. The body is made of plastic but it is rather thick and feels solid. While I first thought it might be a bit small for those with large hands it is larger and thicker than most of the digital cameras out there now so I think ergonomics are a plus here. 

Ergonomics and styling aside, taking pictures is what this is for and this is where the results are mixed. This camera was aggressively priced even when new and current so compromises were made that are even more noticeable now. The unit has poor low-light performance where it does not always focus well and tends to be grainy. Once a picture is taken it requires approx. 5 seconds before it is ready to take another. The constant sliding of the lens cover tends to put a rather garish scrape mark across the front of the camera - not a functional problem but irritating nonetheless.

On the plus side, macro performance is good thanks to a real lens system. Speaking of the lens system, true optical zoom and autofocus add to the picture quality. Fixed focus cameras (digital or otherwise) and digital zoom are both to be avoided for anything other than the most casual of uses. With proper light images are very crisp, colors are good, and autofocus is precise. The 1.6" LCD is useable but not exceptional.

If used within it's limitations this camera will produce images that rival much more expensive cameras. Only recommended though to those that understand its limitations or that are casual users. As a side note, the camera does allow for manual exposure and white balance so you can experiment moreso than many moderately priced digital cameras which might make it more appealing to amateur shutterbugs despite its limitations.
