            About a year ago,  I decided to buy a roadster as a second car. Using the web, researching the various roadsters   available was easy.  I zeroed in on the BMW Z3 and Mazda Miata..Even though the Miata was thousands cheaper, many knowledgeable drivers preferred it over the BMW Z3.  Armed with my research I test drove both cars.  I preferred the appearance of the BMW Z3 but the Miata seem to be a bit more responsive.  Taking the difference in price into consideration,  the Miata was my choice.  I did having this nagging doubt about my decision..  Did the price have an undue influence on my decision?  A year and 10,000 miles later,  I not longer doubt my decision.  The Miata is a well made fun machine.  Every time I drive it, a smile appears on my ugly face.  Driving down a Florida highway, with the top down and the Bose sound system blasting, is my idea of a good time.  My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner.<br><br>
