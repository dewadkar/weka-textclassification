            The nissan pathfinder gives the driver and passengers a smooth ride, unequaled by any other sports utility vehicle that i have ever been in. Not only is the exterior impressive looking, the interior matches it.  With a cd player installed and leather seats, give me a bed and i'll live in one of those things. It's big enough!  The smooth ride given by the nissan pathfinder is so wonderful and peaceful, that sleeping while the driver is navigating an off road trail is no longer impossible.  I know that many of the SUV's that have been coming out are beginning to seem unoriginal, and that is true in regards to this car, it is constantly being copied.  For example, the only difference between the infinity qx4 and the nissan pathfinder is about $20,000.  If your in it for the brand name, just buy the mercedes, it has the emblem and is a piece of crap.  It looks like and drives like a minivan, but it must be great because it's a mercedes.Ha!  If you want a good, smooth, reliable and affordable SUV, i recommend that you test drive the 2000 pathfinder, it's the nicest , functioning (mercedes) SUV that  you will find<br><br>
