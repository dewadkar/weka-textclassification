            I've now owned 2 Chevy S10 Blazers, and my family as a whole has owned 3 if you count the fact that an S15 Jimmy is, basically, the same car. I'm planning on buying a 3rd. First thing: this review is for the 1988-1994 models, not the Next Gen. 95+ models. I can't abide the lines on the later, and will never in a millenia own one. Just so we're clear.

The S10 is a serious Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde kind of car. My first warning: stuff will break. I've never been seriously stranded by these cars, but in 7 years of S10 ownership I've replaced waterpumps on both, had minor but persistant electrical issues (particularly after stereo/alarm installation and with the cig. lighter fuse), problems with the 4WD on the second one, and gauge trouble. First and foremost, the cig. lighter fuse tends to burn out if you leave the lighter in there. Is that lame or what? This fuse also controls the domelight, radio, and rear glass. Keep a box of 15s with you at all times. The electrical systems in these cars are notorious for problems, so only have a PROFESSIONAL who will BACK THEIR WORK do anything like a stereo or alarm install. The waterpumps have an annoying tendancy to die after a couple of years of heavy service in an area like Arizona. Both cars had bad gas gauges (one intermittantly and the other we could never fix). There was a bad run of clear coats and primers, so paint on some of this series tends to, well, fall off or bubble off. Make sure you ask about this.

So why would I even SAY it has a Dr. Jeckyl side? Well, the 2WD I owned first got almost 24mpg on the highway at times. The 4WD about 19 highway. Both were 15-16 city. Outside of the waterpumps kicking, the cars never overheated. I could be doing 50 uphill in 110 degree weather and have the AC running full. The AC units in these cars is astounding, it really, really keeps you cool. Unfortunately, if your selector is on heat but the fan's off, a LOT of heat bleeds out through the vents. while the problems I listed back there are annoyances, they're just that--annoyances. I took both cars to the 150k+ range and never lost a transmission or an engine. They both towed well (Hobie Cats and jetskies, and we used the 4WD to launch larger boats in sand), they handles decently for a car of their style. A lot of lean in a turn so you don't get to fly through. SUV-style blindspots over the driver's and passenger's shoulders. You have to make sure to get a low-mounting tire rack or your visibility will go to nill out the back window. The interior is great for moving most furniture (moved 4 times between the 2 cars).  

They keep their resale value fairly well (all things considered), parts are easy to get and the simpler aspects like lightbulb, fuses, etc. aren't hard to fix yourself. They're built in Canada, so you'll want both metric and English system tools handy.

This was an ideal car for a teenager, IMO. It carried a lot of stuff and people, it's not terribly flashy, it'll protect you decently in an accident, and for an SUV it's not expensive. This is not a car for someone who doesn't expect to need to fix something every once and a while.
