            Owning a Minivan is not the coolest thing to do, but they are very practical.  I would personally choose the Honda Odyssey over almost any vehicle out there.

The 2002 Odyssey is very powerful with the new 240 HP VTEC engine.  Another advantage of the 2002 model is that you will get that horsepower with regular unleaded gasoline.  It will get up and go onto the freeway without any problems at all.  It also will go from 60 to 75 for passing better than just about any vehicle of this size.

I previously owned a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan SE.  I liked that vehicle but would not purchase a Chrysler Minivan again for one major reason.  Resale value.  I lost over 50% of my value in 2.5 years.  I have seen an Odyssey that it 2 years old selling for only 3000 dollars under retail of a new one.

I recently took a 2500 mile vacation and can honestly say that I was comfortable without any issues at all.  I would recommend getting the DVD system if you can afford it.

I plan on keeping mine for years to come.
