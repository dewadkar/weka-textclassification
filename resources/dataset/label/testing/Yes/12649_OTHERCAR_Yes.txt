            After more than 4 years of owning the 4 wheel drive SLE model with a nice level of standard equipment, I have to recommend the full line of Jimmies (they have changed only in small incremental improvements since the first model year - 1995 - of this design) to anyone desiring the tall riding characteristics of a Sport Utility Vehicle while at the same time being unwilling to sacrifice the ability to park and while getting reasonable fuel economy.  The 4.3 litre V-6 is the reason I bought mine originally (Ford dealers blythely believed the smaller and less powerful Explorer V-6 was &quot;all the power anyone&quot; should ever need). It returns mileage of 16 to 20 mpg while being reasonably quick and adequate for medium and small trailer towing.  The feature that is more desirable than ever is the overhead display system that shows a compass or outdoor thermometer reading. The vehicles pluses summed up are a convenient size, a good standard V-6, more nimble handling than the LARGE SUV's on the scene now and the ability to carry cargo or passengers in reasonable comfort.
The drawbacks that are evident relate to interior cloth that has worn badly in places on the drivers seat, recalls (that haven't affected the use of my vehicle), and a concern over the LONGGG term reliability of an American made vehicle.
