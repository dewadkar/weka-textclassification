            I researched digital cameras for nearly a year before settling on the Fuji Finepix 3800. I am NOT a professional photography, most of my pictures come out in the sucky-to-average range, and I don't like toting around a camera to all family affairs. But I am a big-time computer geek and I like to have pictures on my web site, so I needed something that would allow me to take pictures I could CONFIRM fit my needs (old instant gratification thing) and was cheap (in terms of processing) and could quickly get onto the web site.

I don't like those "elf-sized" point and shoots because you can never get close enough to the action or set the focus or frame the shot right, etc. My favorite non-digital camera is a Canon SLR, but I never drag it out of the closet because I'm lazy and too cheap to pay for print processing.

You can see my dilemma.

Anyway, all of the 3/3 and 3/2 (optical/digital) cameras were, in my opinion, a total waste of time. Their zoom was worse than the APS elf-style point and shoots. I wanted someting with at least a 5x zoom and a good lens. A friend has their Sony ($999 at the time) which took impressive pictures, but the price was very prohibitive. 

When the Finepix came out with its 6x optical zoom, I started researching in earnest.

For the price, the Finepix is the best value you can get. But if you are reading this review already, I don't need to give a blow-by-blow on the other cameras. 

**************
Here is what I like about the Finepix:
Zoom (enough said already)

Buttons - everything (zoom, shutter, menus, etc) is within easy reach and is laid out in a logical fashion.

SLR type body - the grip makes holding the camera and using it one-handed very do-able. 

SLR view - I really really wanted a "through the lens" view, whether from the LCD panel or the viewfinder. I get it here and it is great. OK, so "SLR" isn' the technically right term. Who cares?

Resolution - I do *a lot* of image editing on my PC. On the highest setting, the FinePix produces a 9 megabyte file that is crisp and clear and allows me to zoom, crop, adjust colors, etc to my heart's content.

Megapixels - 3.2 is a great number to work with for the average home user. If you get 4 or 5 it's total overkill and you are trying to make up for some other inadequacy in your life. Get a big dog or a porche instead.

***************
Here are the things that are "fine", meaning that they weren't important to me, but they are done in a way that doesn't disturb me either.

Battery life - I don't expect 20 hours of life from 4 AA batteries. I can usually take about 20-50 pictures (more if I don't use the flash at all) depending on the lag time between the charge and the usage. But get a second set of batteries and a rapid charger. It's worth the extra $30.

Software - easy to install, easy to figure out. I have Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro so I'm not using the Fuji software very much anyway. But for grabbing the pics off the camera it does OK.

Connections - USB is cheap and easy and there was no issue connecting it to my laptop or desktop.

Shutter lag - About a second. I have seen much much worse. I would love better, but I'm realistic about what a $400 camera is going to give me.

************
Here are the drawbacks of the Finepix:
shutter speed - Even with the flash, you hit the button and  the picture gets taken with about a 1 second delay. That doesn't sound like much but it's enough for the subject to move if you aren't aware of the lag time.

size (bulk) - My wife wants to throw it in her purse. Ain't happening. I put it in a fanny pack along with a second set of batteries and I'm good to go. But you still look like a Nikon-packing photo-geek when you have it around your neck.

ASA - you only get a 200 setting. So any kind of low-light condition needs a flash, or else the shutter speeds go up to the point where any little handshake creates blurred photos.

Memory - This is actually a minor point in my opinion, but using the XD memory card should be noted if you are looking for cross-compatibility with some other device. Card readers are also slightly more expensive. On the other hand, the USB cable connects directly to the camera, so you don't NEED a reader, necessarily.
