            I purchased this vehicle because I was in the market for a car that had quick acceleration, a nice manual transmission, and alot of performance without too low of a gas mileage....

When one sits inside this vehicle, its more like sitting inside a space ship rather than a car.  The styling is very unique and stunning, guaranteed to turn heads.  

Acceleration is peppy in the 140hp GT model, and quick in the 180hp GTS model.  With the GTS's 6-speed manual transmission (which I love) you can vault the car up to 60mph in around 6.5 seconds....quite fast.  If a manual transmission is not for you, the automatic transmission is smooth, and a electronic sports shifter is available.  Braking is incredible in this vehicle, as it can almost stop on a dime.   

So far it seems as if this car would be irresistable, but there are several reasons why someone wouldn't choose this car.  A Celica GTS is priced in the low-20's, and although you get a great performing vehicle, you can get a 2000 Mustang GT for a comparable price and with almost a hundred horses more.  In addition, visibility in the Celica over the shoulder is quite bad, and might pose a problem in traffic sometimes...

I love this car, and I know that it will last alot longer than a Mustang GT, despite the Mustang's more power for the buck.  But this car has got an extremely fast little 4 cylinder, great styling(if it suits your taste), unparalleled braking, and exceptional Toyota Quality behind it.<br><br>
