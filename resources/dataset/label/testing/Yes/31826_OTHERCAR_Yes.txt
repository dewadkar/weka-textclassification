            My 1997 Civic EX Coupe is the 4th Civic I've owned.  I have bought all of them new; and I even traded one in after a little more than a year, because Honda came out with a color I liked better.

Years ago, my sister bought a Honda (her first car), when the Accord was little more than a pregnant roller skate :)  This was the beginning of amazing family loyalty to the brand.  My sister has owned Preludes (no children, career woman); my parents are on their 3rd Accord; and I stick to Civics.

I was a single parent of 3, on a tight budget, when I bought my first Civic Sedan.  It was an attractive, well-recommended car within my budget constraints.  I've never regretted that choice.  All of my Civics have been trouble free except for routine maintenance items.  The ride has been comfortable, and the pep is surprising for a car with a small engine.

My children are now grown and I own a Civic EX coupe...my answer to a sportier car.  I admit that I've always wanted a Honda Prelude, but I'm one of those people who would rather not spend big bucks on a car...so I bought another Civic, and I've never regretted the decision.<br><br>
