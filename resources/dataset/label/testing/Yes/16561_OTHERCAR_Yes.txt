              When i got my drivers license, this little beauty was already waiting in my driveway for me... a '91 jetta, not the most glamorous car by any means, but it is as if not more reliable than any other car on the road.  When i inherited the car it had already been near totaled twice, and it had over 100,000 miles on it, one would think that this car was on its way out, but not a jetta.  I love it, it still runs excellent, and is quick enough to even win an unauthorized speed contest or two.  Of course, its five speed, and i beat the hell out of it, but it takes everything i give it, and more.  Recently upon returning from college, it seemed to me that the car was running even better than it had been before i left, i dunno maybe it just gets better with age, at least i think so. Others are perhaps not so enthusiastic about the car, but i love it, and would prefer it over any other car in the price range. 
  Now to the car itself, the body has held up very well in its ten years of existence, and there is nearly no rust at all. As i previously mentioned, the engine runs great, and other than some belts and regular tune ups, i have not had any problems with it at all. Another great thing about the jetta is its amazing gas mileage. At one point, i made a 300 mile road trip, and used only 1/2 tank of gas. I figure to be getting about 35 mpg, and it could be much higher if i drove more cautiously. The only real problem that i have had with my jetta is the fact that the back two doors are permanently closed, something broke with the locking mechanisms, and now they are forever sealed.  This is not really that big of a deal, and its probably a 10 dollar job to fix, but it is a nuisance for my passengers.  Personally i kinda like it, it adds a certain character to the car that others just dont possess.
  I am a big fan of volkswagens in general, and i love my jetta.  Other than some minor setbacks it has done great for me and continues to do so as it gets further and further passed 100k miles.  I would recommend the jetta to anyone who wants a great car for the money they are willing to spend. <br><br>
