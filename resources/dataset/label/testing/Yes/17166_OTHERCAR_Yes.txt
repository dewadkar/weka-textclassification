            I grew up with Camry's.  My first car was a 1986 Camry Sedan.  After I crashed the car in 1992 my mother gave me her 1988 Camry V6 Station Wagon.  Let me tell you that it lasted me all through high school, college, and a couple of working years.  It was until recently that I bought another car because I had a great deal.  Since I have had so much memory with the Camry I did not sell it, rather I kept the car in my parent's home.  It has over 250K miles and I still drive it sometimes.

When my parents first bought this car back in 1988 this was a gem.  Its V6 engine pushed out some 160 horse power, which was a great improvement over the V4 Camry's.  The extra horse power enabled me to drive up a hill at 70 MPH with air-con all the way turned up and I still had some extra room for the gas pedal.  The Wagon had offered more room in the back than the sedan, which helped a lot when I was moving to college. 

All Toyotas I have been into have good displays, the Camry was no different.  It was easy for me to see everything which I need to see (speed and time) while I am driving.  The sound system was not too great but then was not bad either (for its time, of course).  The buttons were big making it easy to change songs and radio stations while driving.

Camrys are fairly spacious for mid-sized cars.  Although the back was slightly cramped with 3 people it was not too bad.  Since this is a wagon, the back seats could be folded so you could fit some really big stuff in the back.  

I have to admit that in its later years the Camry did suffer some problems.  The muffler was replaced a couple of times.  The electric antenna was broken (I found this to be a big problem with Toyota cars, including the Lexus).  The paint started to peel and I started to see some rust by 150K miles.  At around 200K miles the transmission broke down, and it costed me around $1000 to fix.  Around the same time the radiation fluids and engine oils also started to leak.  Then by 250K the air-con would overheat and stop working if turned on for too long.

The car itself however, is still functional.  I could still drive it over 80 mph without fearing it would break down at the moment.  I went to NYC from Boston a few times with the car when it had around 250K miles and it was fine although I wouldn't do that anymore.  The car is showing its age but it could still easily out drive even the newer V4 cars.
