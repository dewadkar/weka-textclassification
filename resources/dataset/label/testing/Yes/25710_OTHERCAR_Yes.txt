            This SUV is just too small!  Try putting three kids in the back seat... all with car seats.. it just doesn't work too well... now, I agree I shouldn't be using my SUV as a mini-van but, then, I don't want to drive a bus (otherwise known as a mini-van).  My pathfinder is just too cramped and crowded!  The trunk is too small (compared to other SUVs), the cup holders are in the middle.. between the two seats... which is extremely annoying!

The pathfinder has too many brake problems!  I've taken mine to the mechanic a number of times and it is just a few years old!  It is a 95  The ride is very bumpy and uncomfortable.  You don't get too many options on this one and it is just ugly (I don't know what made me buy it?????... yeah, I'll admit I saved a few bucks on it)

Nissan just doesn't know how to make a good SUV... I'll take a jeep any day.  The only good thing about it is that it is a sports utility that I can use in the snow storm although using the four wheel drive gears are difficult... I still haven't gotten the hang of it.... and I've heard that other SUVs are easier to handle.... I don't know maybe I just am not the Suv type.  <br><br>
