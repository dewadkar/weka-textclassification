            These days everyone wants a bargain. It�s as American as baseball � we as consumers want more, but we want to pay less.  In fact entire companies have been built on just that principle.  Payless shoe stores ask �why pay more?�  I�ll tell you why, QUALITY that�s why. And yet more and more we as consumers seem to be getting exactly what we want, quality at a lower price.  Think about it in automotive terms, our parents and grandparents never had it so good.  An automotive consumer shopping for a used car, could buy a 3 year old Lexus ES300 for about $20,000 or a �98 Corvette with a 345 hp V8 for just over $25,000 or a �97 Audi A4 for about $15,000.  Each of those cars is relatively high on the automotive food chain.  When in our automotive history have we ever been able to get such a bargain as a 345 hp sports car with great handling many creature comforts for about the same price as a new family sedan?  Given the glut of high quality, reasonably priced used cars, one can�t help but wonder how this effects the new car market. Simply put, new car makers have to offer more value and quality than ever. We as consumers must be convinced to buy a new Nissan rather than a 2 year old Lexus.

Championing this cause of  �more for less� is Kia.  Kia is shaping up to be one of those watershed companies that will, or already has changed the automotive industry forever.  The Kia Optima alone is enough to get many shoppers to ask �why am I buying an Accord?� Five years ago I�d have bet $1000 no one would ever consider a Kia instead of a Honda Civic or Accord.

Here is where the Sedona comes in. Kia has a new minivan that will absolutely challenge the stalwarts of  the minivan universe. Anyone who dismisses Kia�s entry into the lucrative minivan market is only kidding themselves.  Right out of the gate the Sedona, in it�s first incarnation, is already much better than the Mercury Villager, Nissan Quest, and Ford Windstar.  

Kia�s winning formula is liberally applied to the Sedona; lots of features, low price. It�s just that simple. The Sedona offers such standard equipment as V6 engine (195hp), 5-speed automatic transmission, power accessories, cruise control, rear A/C, seating for 7 w/ removable 2nd and 3rd row seats, tilt wheel, tinted rear windows, and dual sliding rear doors. Opt for the upscale EX model and you�ll be treated to alloy wheels, fog lights, keyless entry, power seats,  6 speaker AM/FM/cassette/CD, and some chrome trim on the outside. The only thing missing from the standard features list is ABS which is an option on both the LX an EX. Further options on the EX are: leather, two tone paint, Homelink, and a power sunroof. The standard features alone make the Sedona LX worth the $19,000 sticker price ($21,000 for the EX), but add Kia�s still unbelievable 5 year / 60,000 mile bumper to bumper and 10 year / 100,000 mile power train warranty and the value becomes all the more obvious.

Although the Sedona may not be the BEST looking minivan in the world, many people on the street were impressed enough with the looks of the EX to assume it cost $30,000 to $40,000. One woman guessed $32,000, when I reminded her it was a Kia, she asked �where are they made?� �Korea� I replied, �Oh� she exclaimed, �in that case I�d say $42,000.�  Her jaw nearly hit the floor when I quoted the $20,000 price. It�s easy to see why non-car enthusiasts would expect the Sedona to be so expensive. In EX trim it projects a bit of class. Chrome grille, alloy wheels, and multi-reflector headlamps give a definite up market impression.  Fog lights are sculpted nicely into the large front fascia. By contrast the rear of the Sedona is rather bland. Simple tail-lights and step bumper make it look like many other minivans.

Once on the road in the Sedona, it is painfully obvious what great job Kia has done with this vehicle (painful for other, more expensive makes that is). The build quality is top notch, wind noise is minimal, road noise is minimal and the only engine noise seems to be from the power steering pump of all things � the sound is noticeable, but hardly intrusive, and again 10 times better than a van like the Mercury Villager. As stated earlier, this van is better than some that have been on sale for years. The Sedona will likely not woo Honda Odyssey owners, but it is equal in quality to, and offers more features than the Mazda MPV.  

The Sedona�s ride is good balance between firm and soft, however cornering is where the balance shifts to �too soft.�  There is plenty of body roll and lean when cornering even at moderate speeds, but this decidedly non-sporty ride is most likely what accounts for the Sedona�s pleasant highway manners.  The Sedona feels more solid and refined than even the General Motors line of minivans which are larger, but lack the smoothness of the Sedona�s power train.  Acceleration is adequate. By comparison, the smaller Sedona has 10 more horsepower than GM�s minivans. From a stop the 3.5 liter engine pulls away without much drama, but at moderate speeds, the engine seems slightly more up to the task. 

Inside the Sedona is an interesting combination of usefulness and luxury. The EX is certainly the more luxurious, but doesn�t lack the utility of the LX. Dual sliding rear doors are not power, but are so effortless a power feature would seem silly. Besides, many parents have voiced concern over a rear door that closes with an electric motor, fearing their children may be caught in such a mechanism. A folding center tray similar to that found in the Honda CRV is very convenient as it will accommodate four cup or bottles, plus a center tray for wallet or smaller items.  The gear selector is placed on the dash just below the radio. While odd at first, it doesn�t take long to realize how much extra space is gained by this one design element. Just below the shifter are more storage areas, storage that would not exists if a more traditional console type shifter was used.  

Seats feel hard at first and lack the softness one expects from a minivan, but seat time of an hour or more reveals the more supportive nature of the front seats.  Middle row seats allow normal sized adults to ride in relative comfort, but the 3rd row seats seem to have even more room. 2nd row seats can slide forward and back, and event the 3rd row passengers can recline their seatbacks. Like most minivans today, the Sedona�s seats can be configured in so many different ways. All can be removed, leave two, remove just one � the possibilities are endless. The 2nd row seats are slightly heavy, and not everyone will be able to accomplish this chore alone.

Another unexpected feature given the  Sedona�s price is  power operated rear quarter windows.  Most minivans have pop-out windows in the back to help with ventilation. The Sedona�s are power operated, but unlike more expensive minivans, the Sedona�s rear windows can be opened by the driver, or the passenger sitting near that window.  There are switches placed on the armrest of the 3rd row seats making it possible for a rear seat occupant to open his or her own window.  If kids are riding in the back, simply lock out all power window positions.

Overall the Kia Sedona represents a great value. Families that might otherwise be able to afford only a used minivan with little or no warranty protection now have an additional alternative. Other minivan choices are available in the $20,000 range, but most of those vehicles lack the features and warranty of the Sedona.  The Mazda MPV is by far the closest to the Sedona in terms of quality, value, and size. Kia�s warranty is the deal breaker when consider other budget priced family haulers.  The Although there are minor compromises along the way, the Sedona offers all of us what we have always wanted, more for less
