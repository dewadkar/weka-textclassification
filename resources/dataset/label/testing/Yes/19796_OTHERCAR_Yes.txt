                   <b>T</b>he restyled Mercury Cougar was the car to be nominated to transform Mercury's image from a conservative auto manufacturer to a builder of sexy automobiles with imagination and performance. It is a front wheel drive 2 2 sports coupe with outstanding handling that was developed in Germany.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

     <b>E</b>xpectations are high for such a bold shape, and the Cougar does not disappoint in any respect besides lacking a bit in out-right acceleration. Its real strength is in its excellent handling. To get the best out of this wild cat, you have to drive the car fast. This car is biased to give somewhat mild understeer, it is extremely responsive and easy to control. The steering, particularly, has a great feel. With its relatively advanced chassis, it has exceptional road-handling, which seems to get better the faster the car goes. Hills are taken well, the 5-speed manual is relatively low geared, so access to this car's horse power, even in high gear with the V6 engine allows for excellent hill climbing. The ride is also relatively quiet for a sporty car, and the suspension, while stiff, also is soft enough to make trips over rough surfaces comfortable.

        <b>About this little V6 engine:</b> Mercury Cougars are powered by the Ford designed 2.0 4-cyl or the 2.5 Duratec V6 ( as was in my tester). It's a lightweight 60-degree, short srtoke designed to rev beyond 6,000 RPM without fuss. The alloy block has dry cast-iron linders and alloy heads, plus a reinforcing ladder between the block and oil pan to stiffen the engine. Its four overhead camshafts are belt driven, and hollow, this is why the 2.5 Duratec V6 is so light. For '2000, the horsepower is at 170 for the V6 model, not sure exactly about the 2.0 4-cyl base engine's power output, but it's significantly less than the V6.

   For its new Cougar, Ford/Mercury uses the CDW 27 Contour front drive-platform as a starting point. The Cougar keeps all the existing floorpan and <b>suspension</b> location points, but has significantly altered spring, bushings and shock rates. Also the whole car is lowered 1.5" resulting in a lower center of gravity. Suspension is by struts all around, but with multilinks in the rear.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>  

     The Cougars <b>interior</b> is relatively luxurious yet sporty. The Cougar has some of the best ergonomics and interior room of any car in its class. Race car inspired gauges add a very good touch to this car's dashboard. The seats are very supportive, a little more bolstering of the bucket seats would be nice, but as they stand they are adequately comfortable. The stick shift feels like silk in your hands, and the 6-speaker stock stereo system is a blast! 


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>            

     The <b>exterior</b> is also class leading if you ask me. Beautiful lines, sleek and composed looking at any angle. This car was, when introduced in 1999, and still is a big head turner! Unfortunately the aftermarket community is limited.

<i>Pricing:</i>

      The <b>price</b> is very affordable. At $18,000 fully loaded "new," you get what you pay for. Decent acceleration,  a 170hp powered DOHC V6, superb handling, great looks, and amenities galore! I have seen the 4-cyl models go for as low as $11,000 for the '2000 model year, but the V6 costing around $2,000 more 'used' is the way to go if you are looking for a slightly used/good performing automobile. 

  From countless remarks in car chat rooms about how unreliable these cars are, I'd check the facts, using <b>Consumer Reports.Org</b>, or some other reliable source. I have only driven this car for a week, thanks to a good friend who owns a car dealership, so it would be wrong of me to comment on reliability, but while I had it , it was trouble free at 26,000-26,500 miles.
