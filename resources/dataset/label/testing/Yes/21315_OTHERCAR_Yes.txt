            Guess my Ex-Hubby, a mechanic for 30+ years, wanted me in a car that wouldn't need a lot of his attention!  He suggested a Camry and I'm thrilled I listened!  Last year I bought a 1999 Camry and I love it! It has a smooth ride and gives me about 30-35 miles per gallon. A big bonus with gas prices rising the way they are!  Great car on long distance trips!  Easily maneuvered into tight places!  If I had to find a fault in the car, the only one I've found so far is, when it rains and you have the window open it drips in! Sometimes quite a bit!  Unlike most of the American cars, several of the foreign makers, in my opinion have been remiss in leaving off those little gutters along the edges of the roofs (there's probably a more scientific name for them).  They do keep water from seeping in during a heavy rainfall.  But.....I'm not complaining, If iwas choosing another new car, and given the option of getting a little wet and picking another Camry or staying dry and buying an American car.......I'd still choose another CAMRY!<br><br>
