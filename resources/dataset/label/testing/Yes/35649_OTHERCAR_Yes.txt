            I own a 1989 Dodge Grand Caravan and Love it! There is
room for all 4 children and the dog. This is the first 
vehicle I have owned that we could take more than one
bag each on vacation and extra goodies. I find the gas
mileage to be Greater than my previous station wagon.
I love the easy movable and removable seats. I have owned
my Grand Caravan for 11 years and it has bean almost problem
free! My children love all the room for friends and extra
gear. I highly reccomend this vehicle to anyone! So much that
I also bought a new 98 Caravan a year ago, and now I own 2!<br><br>
