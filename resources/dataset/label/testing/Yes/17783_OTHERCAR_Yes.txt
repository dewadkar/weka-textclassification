            My first car was a 1994 Dodge Shadow.  All of my friends were paying 5 and 6 thousand dollars for cars that were older and not as reliable.  I paid 4 thousand dollars for my shadow.  I have put over 10,000 miles on it in the first year I had.  I was driving to baseball games which were and hour way on a regular basis.  My friends did not want to drive because they thought there car would not make it.  I have never had a problem with it in any sense.  In the almost two years I have had it, it has never gone into the shop.  It passed inspection perfectly.  It is in great condition and it is about to turn over 100,000 miles.  I get great miles to the gallon.  It gets around 24 - 27 miles to the gallon on the normal.  It has always started and I never have to worry about being in trouble when I am in my Dodge shadow.  If you ever want a dependable car, and one that handles real well in the snow also.  I have driven home many nights in a snow storm and never had a problem, then pick the Dodge shadow.  It is also a good car for a beginner because you do not have to worry about acceleration an high speed because it is only a 4-cylinder.<br><br>
