            I purchased my J30 when it was two years old from an Infiniti dealer to take advantage of a great extended warranty program, 6 years or 70K miles.  The J30 is not your typical car, with it's rare styling you either love it or hate it.  If you are looking for a typical four door people mover, move on, this is not the car for you. On the other hand if you are looking for a sedan with the qualities of a sports car, definitely take a look.

The J30 has a 3 liter engine lifted from the old Nissan 300ZX driving the rear wheels with plenty of power on tap.  The car handles wonderfully and is also very quiet due to all the curved body panels.

The rear seat is best forgotten and only used in a pinch.  While the seats are plenty comfortable, it is the legroom or lack there of that is the problem.  In the driver's seat is where you want to spend your time, having a blast.

If you are considering the J30, it came in two trim lines: the base model and the J30t (touring model).  The touring model simply gives you a stiffer suspension and a small spoiler on the trunk lid, which in my opinion breaks up the lines of the car.  The J30 is a flowing, curved work of art, why put a speed bump on the trunk lid and ruin it?  My advice, buy the base model because it has everything you need.

The car comes equipped!  There were only three options, an integrated phone, spoiler, and mud flaps.  Standard items include: leather, sunroof(metal,not glass), 200 watt Bose with 6 speakers, CD &amp; tape, power mirrors with defrost, rear defrost, auto dimming mirror, auto climate, power seats, and remote entry.  Infiniti even thought about little things like putting a first aid kit in a special compartment in the trunk.

I have always kept my car serviced at the Infiniti dealer and would recommend it to anyone.  I have always been treated like I was the only customer in the world and they want me to be happy, loaner Infiniti's are also available while they have your car.  Every time I have looked into it, the dealer prices were only slightly more for service, so they get my business because they know the car more than some Bubba at a corner shop.

Finally, on a sad note, the J30 is no longer imported.  The car was sold in the US from 93-97.  I plan on keeping my car around for many years to come, with regular service, hundreds of thousands of miles are possible. 

On closing, if you want a solidly built sports car with a back seat to use in a pinch, give the J a look.  <br><br>
