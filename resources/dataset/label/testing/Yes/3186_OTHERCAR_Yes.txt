            Bought a classic 71 spider a few years ago as I've wanted on for a long time. I love it with its roof off and don't even drive it with the roof on. Gets lots of looks all the time and very reliable even though mine has almost 130,000 miles on it. You do have to be patient getting parts by I did one better by buying a parts car for a few hundred bucks. My total investment is &lt;2K and it starts every time I turn the key. I bought the manual and do my own maintenance. 

Driving: Great, but not for long trips or on highways. Two lane roads in the late afternoon or evening with the stars it is great. Handles wonderfully and sounds better than any other small car like this. How good does it sound? I have a push button radio in it that I hardly use. Stops strong- even the old model it has disk brakes all around. Good balance, strong torque especially above 3000 rprm. Oooh but that sound.

Don't like the way Alfa rust proofed these cars. But many cars of this age weren't properly protected. Don't take mine out when the weather is snowy or icy as it doesn't need any salt on it at its age. Worse yet its too light to get any grip on anything but dry roads.

Many othewise bright people are scared off by an broad opinion that Alfas are not reliable or are expensive to fix. They are lumping Alfas in with Fiats and Ferraris and they shouldn't. Remember there are big differences between Ford and GMs.

As well, otherwise bright mechanics, who don't know Alfas get impatient with them and should not work on them. I found out the hard way. If you like to do it do it yourself, or look around for an Alfa mechanic. If you do look to buy one make sure its maintained properly by a loving owner or better yet an Alfa mechanic. In fact he may be the person to see if he knows of an available machine for sale.

If you don't need much room you could drive it all the time otherwise its a second fun car. Especially if you like driving as I do. I also own a full size Chevy Van which I appreciate for its good points- space and utility. But knowing I have a Spider that is just good old fashion fun to drive makes driving the big Chevy a little more bearable.

In this category I have previously owned VWs, Fiats, MGs and BMWs and it rates at the top of this group.

If you are seriously considering purchasing one, but want some guidance before you jump, buy Pat Braden's book, &quot;The Alfa Owner's Bible&quot; $22 at Lauriats book store or Amazon.<br><br>
