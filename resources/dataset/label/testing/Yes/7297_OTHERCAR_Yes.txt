            I am a die hard film user. At one point in my career path, I had trained as a professional photographer. Now that I have a strong desire to send pictures over the Internet, I had a reason to go digital. With my background, picture quality was very important to me, but I did not want to loose sight that this was going to be a fun camera, not a serious camera for posed location or studio work. After studying all I could on what's available and comparing image quality, I was facing a dilemma: Should I blow the budget and go with superb optical quality at all cost or hold my self in check and maybe sacrifice a few features?

I quickly found out that a higher price usually meant a higher pixel count. After examining what I was buying with the higher pixel count cameras, I realized I would not be using these features very often. In brief, the higher the pixel count, the bigger the image. This is great if your goal is to produce a true color 8x10 or 11x14, but my goal was to send &quot;happy snaps&quot; of the family and vacations over the Internet. I was still planning on retaining my favorite 35mm camera for &quot;fine&quot; work.

Once I had that decision nailed down, I went to a local electronics superstore to get my hands on the models in my short list and feel the differences. First up was a spoiler, the Nikon 880. I picked the camera up cold (without reading the manual) and within 5 minutes, I was using it. I then went to the low end, price wise, the Olympus D-450. After fifteen minutes I still could not figure out the controls and gave up. I moved up one model and $100 to the Olympus D-460. I found the control layout very easy to decipher and I was using it in the store in about five minutes. Since I could buy two of these for the cost of the Nikon 880, I had to evaluate what I was sacrificing. For me,in this case, the additional picture sizes and shooting modes that Nikon offered did not hold any advantage. My goal was simple snapshots to be sent over the Internet to be taken with as little fuss as possible.

Needless to say, I chose the Olympus D-460. After reading the manual quickly, I was able to set it up and take my first shot. Seeing the image immediately after tripping the shutter was a real pleasent surprise. I was thrilled with the quality and the exposure was dead on. The camera was then packed up as I was leaving on a trip the next day.

Over the next two days, the camera performed admirably under some challenging conditions. The weather was between outright rain and overcast. A lot of pictures were taken under a tent with severe backlighting. Because of other factors, all these photos had to be taken using available light(no flash) only. After previewing the first photo and deleting it, I used the on-screen controls to adjust the exposure and change to spot metering mode to get quite acceptable images. It took a few tries, but I eventually got the right combination. Even with a film camera, I doubt there would have been much improvement.

My first disappointment was when I downloaded the images to my laptop. They were huge! I also wish my camera had come bundled with an external card reader. Transferring the images from the camera via serial port was slow and I was using the camera's battery. While not as power hungry as some other digital cameras, I'd rather save the battery power for taking pictures. A quick consultation with the manual and the camera was reconfigured for a smaller image size while still retaining high quality. If you purchase this camera, I suggest changing the image size before you begin using the camera.

The next day the weather was nicer, just overcast, and I had an opportunity to do outdoor scenic photos. The evening's downloads were just fine. The exposure was consistent, color saturation was good and the detail of the images was better than I expected. Olympus was on my short list because of their optical reputation and these images proved the reputation is deserved.

Recently, I gave the camera what I consider the ultimate workout: my family went to the circus. While the exposures were good, the camera finally showed some short comings. The metering, even in spot metering mode, had problems with the highlights. Part of the reason is digital images do not have the exposure latitude of film, that is film can handle a wider range of dark to light than a digital image can. Another part of the reason is the limited zoom range of the camera. I could lock the exposure easily, but I could not zoom in close enough to exclude enough of the dark background to get an accurate meter reading. There is no way to set a fully manual exposure, so I will have to learn to live with this shortcoming. Because there is very little mechanical vibration, it is difficult to judge when the camera shutter trips making timing a shot a real art. Nonetheless, some of the shots were done very well.

In fairness, I made my decision weighted towards price. If I had opted for the more expensive models, I would have had a wider zoom range and more exposure choices. Given my purpose, this is a second camera, not a primary one, I could not justify the considerably higher cost to get these features. If I were replacing a film camera with a digital camera, my decision process would have been weighted differently. All in all, I am pleased with the camera. I knew I was making some sacrifices with my price point, but I feel this camera delivers the maximum available for the price.<br><br>
