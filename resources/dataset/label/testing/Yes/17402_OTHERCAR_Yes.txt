            We are now in our second 4-runner.  The ride is exceptional and the handling is outstanding for a SUV.  We were initially concerned about the purchase of a SUV, due to the reports on possible roll-over accidents.  However we feel completely secure with the stability of this vehicle. Once again Toyota has lived up to it's reputation for fine vehicles.  The interior is not only luxurious but very comfortable.  We feel a sense of security with the field of vision the 4-runner affords us.  The seats are easily folded down for extra cargo space.  As a family vehicle is perfect in every department.  We purchased a SUV for the room, the cargo space and the height.  And with three large dogs it was the perfect choice.  <br><br>
