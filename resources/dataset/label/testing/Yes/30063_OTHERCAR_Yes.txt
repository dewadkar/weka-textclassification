            I purchased the Kodak DC280 about 2 months ago, and I am still very thankful that I bought it. A new baby was born in the family, and I wanted to take as many pictures as I could to look back on later. I researched digital cameras online for about a month, and in that time, I changed my mind many times regarding which camera to buy. Eventually, it came down to the Nikon Coolpix 800, Nikon Coolpix 950, and the Kodak DC280. Since I would be sharing the camera with my family, I decided on the Kodak because of the ease of use. I must say that everyone that uses it finds it very easy, and just loves it. If you are looking for a straightforward point and shoot camera, this is a great choice! It is almost as simple as a 35 mm camera, which is a definite plus. I bought an extra 32 MB Compact Flash card, and I always have plenty of room for pictures. When set on �High� resolution and �Best� quality, the pictures are around 500kb. I think that is a reasonable size, but I always reduce them using Paint Shop Pro 6. The picture quality comes out excellent when set on �Best� quality. On lower settings, it is not that great, but still good. The software that comes with it is excellent. You can get your pictures off the camera just as if it was a hard drive, and it is extremely fast. Adobe Photo Deluxe is a great program. It has many features, and it guides you through them all. It also comes with Adobe Page Mill, but I have no need for it, and have not tried it.

	As for the disadvantages, there are very few. If you are going to be taking pictures of fast moving objects or close-ups, do not buy this camera. When taking pictures of a baby, they move very fast, and the picture becomes blurred. I have also tried to take pictures of a soccer game, and almost all of the pictures came out unclear. Taking close-up pictures come out incredibly blurry, and you cannot even make out the picture. I have tried taking close-ups of bugs, stamps, and eyes, each coming out terrible. However, I normally do not use this feature. A small complaint towards the camera is the battery life. If you are going to be shooting many pictures (50+) at once, the batteries will die. I have not found the need to buy extra batteries besides the 4 NIMH batteries that came with it, but many people would have to. A 3x zoom would have been nice, but the 2x is ok. If you really wanted a better zoom lens, you can buy an attachment for about $100. 
	
	To anyone thinking about buying this camera, I say go for it. It is a great camera, and you will be quite pleased. However, if you like advanced features, or are planning on taking pictures of fast moving objects or small things, keep shopping around.
