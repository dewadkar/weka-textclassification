            I would like to start out by saying that I drive one of these beautiful cars and that I love every minute driving it around, but parking it is a pain in the ass. Never park near the front of the supermarket. There is a high probability that your car may be dented, and that just sucks. Anyways, the Lincoln Navigator can hold up to 7 comfortable people, while providing ample head and leg room (unless you're stuck sitting in the stadium seats, but its just cool sitting up there so you won't even care about the head/leg room).
I bought this car because my parents did not want me driving a small civic or Honda Accord, cuz &quot;they to danger&quot;. I am very happy with this 5.6 liter gas guzzler because chicks dig it. People  with a good driving record and a gas card should buy this car, it is grrrrreat!<br><br>
