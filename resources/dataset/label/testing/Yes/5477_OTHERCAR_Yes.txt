            I come from a family of Prizms....
I own a 1999 Chevrolet Prizm, and despite my initial grumbles about buying anything other than a sports car, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  I bought the car in June of 99 and have been driving it between states and locally.  My parents helped me purchase the car, as it was my first and I had just graduated from college.  
The car has never given me any problems.  It is a standard, 4 door car, almost identical to the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic.  The main reason for purchasing the Prizm was that my parents had a GM card rebate and it significantly lowered the cost for me.  Also, my mother owns a '97 Prizm and was so happy with it that my parents insisted on buying the Prizm for me.  It is rated very well in Consumer Reports for its category.  
The best thing about this car is the ability to brake quickly and safely.  Driving in Boston has afforded me several close calls and my car has performed excellently every time.  I feel safe in my Prizm and for me, that is the first priority.  Another great thing is the gas mileage.  I can drive back home to my parents' house for 6 hours on one tank of gas.  
The only thing I am not happy with is the inability to completely control the windshield wiper speed.  But it is a small inconvenience when coupled with the car's safety.
The prizm is an excellent first car for recent college graduates.  My parents are trying to get my sister to buy one too...   Despite the embarrassment of 3 Prizms in one family, it does prove that the car has some value among many lemons.<br><br>
