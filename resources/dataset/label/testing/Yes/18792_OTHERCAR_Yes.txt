            In time, all good things must come to an end. High school. FreeRide.com. The cherry Fruit Roll-Up. And � I say this with a heavy heart � my aforereviewed (I made that word up, so give me credit for future usages by referencing me in a footnote) Explorer. That�s right. The Explorer - a veteran of road trips to all directions of the compass - saw it�s last day. We sent it off with a fitting tribute, of course: a late-night road trip to Saratoga Springs for some debauchery with my chums Nick and �Ski; naturally, we video-taped it, as well. Then, sadly, Pops followed me to Sev�s automotive sales, where I traded my beloved companion in for a Jeep. Yes, it was a <I>nice</I> Jeep; a �98 Limited that had been a stolen vehicle, so my broke-college-kid-a$$ got it at a fraction of the Blue Book. But it was still just a Jeep. Not an Explorer. Though I drove it, I was giving it the cold shoulder the whole time.

But I drove it, and drove it, and drove it, and . . . well, you get the picture. I delivered in it all summer, and then made the Albany-Rochester commute to school a few times in preparation for sophomore year. Once school got a-cookin�, I snagged another delivery job (it appears to be my life�s calling) here in Rochester, which involved, of course, more driving. So, here I am, nearly a year after having bought the Jeep . . . and yes, it has grown on me. Though it does, as of yet, lack the history that the Explorer and I shared, I have grown comfortable enough in my relationship with the Jeep to perhaps open it up to such experiences; so that we may grow together. 

Yeah, so . . .

So anyway, when it comes right down to it, the two cars aren�t incredibly different. It sounds funny to say that, and . . . I don�t know if it�s really that true. Similar, though.

For one, they both boast a 4.0 6 cylinder; the only difference being that the Jeep has an inline-6, whereas the Explorer had a v-6. Though my studies have found them to possess the same horsepower (190), I find that the Explorer was quicker and ballsier off the line, whereas the Jeep has a faster, steadier acceleration. Regardless, both definitely do the proverbial trick. Also, though I prefer the Jeep�s console-shifter to the Explorer�s column-shifter, I�m not a big fan of the Jeep�s transmission; I don�t think it shifts as smoothly as the Explorer�s did (that is, of course, until the Explorer�s stopped shifting). However, the 4x4 engaging system on the Jeep is far superior - the Explorer had a push-button system that was: a., not very masculine nor rugged, and b. prone to breaking, as mine did. In addition, the Explorer�s wasn�t supposed to be engaged while driving at any real speed, and you had to go in reverse to properly disengage it. The Jeep, on the other hand, features a nice little black handle next to the transmission. Give �er a yank into one of the four positions (off, part-time 4x4 high, full-time 4 x4 high, 4x4 low, or something like that), and you�re good to go. You can do it at any speed up to 55, and you can disengage it at any point, too � no �make a right turn while honking the horn and pulling the level repeatedly� to shut of this 4x4, no sir. Trust me, pulling this black handle makes you feel like the man. I don�t know why, it just does. Similarly, I feel like the man pulling emergency brake levers. I dunno; it doesn�t take much to make me feel like the man.

The Jeep is definitely a lot smaller than the Explorer was, which was evident the second we pulled it into the garage and remarked how it took up half the space. However, at the same time, I�ve found that whatever space was lost wasn�t really necessary, as I�ve had ample cargo room to cart around whatever I needed. Really the only downside to the size of the Jeep would be the back seats, which are very, very cramped, especially with my ghetto a$$ driver�s seat reclined almost flat. The cargo area can be flattened by folding down the back bench seat; here the Explorer was advantageous again, in that it featured split rear seats, meaning that I could put down one single seat in the back to fit in snowboards and still leave two functional seats. In the Jeep, it�s all or nothin�. 

The gas mileage on both cars blew / blows. The Jeep gets like 15-20 miles to the gallon, depending on how she�s feeling that day. Sometimes my gas gauge doesn�t work, though, and it tells me that I have no gas left 5 minutes after filling it up. While the idea isn�t that preposterous in this gas guzzling monstrosity, it still gives m�ticker a jump. Word on the street is that gas-gauge problems were a factory defect, though the commies at Armory Jeep refused to fix mine as per the recall. Similarly, there was a recall on �98 brakes, which I�ve heard are chronically bad. However, in the 10 months of my Jeep I haven�t had any brake problems, so I dunno. I mean, they work. Well, I guess. I stop when I want to.

The Jeep has fair share of quirks, too. For one, there�s an odd lip at the base of the door that you have to step over. You really have to mount on up into this gem. The cornering is awkward, too � pulling a U-ie makes you feel like you�re either going to rip apart all the linkage, or just outright roll your vehicle. Very disconcerting. I�ve been told that these guys are great for off roading, but I�m too broke to pay for any unforeseen off roading damages, so I�ll hold off on that one until I have money to pay for stupidity. The stereo�s decent; I put in an after-market one, which was a very, very easy install (meaning it�s a very easy theft, as well). The overhead speaker pods in the back are cool, as they don�t get obstructed and thus prevent you from rockin� out. Oh, and speaking of getting stolen (I dunno, I mentioned it a sentence or two back), Cherokees are supposedly very easy theft targets. I�m not concerned, however, because mine was already stolen from the previous owner, so I�m naively assuming that lightning won�t strike this whip twice. This paragraph has been very disjointed and odd; something of a grammatical leper.

Perhaps ironically, though, it was the refinement of the Jeep that finally finished my conversion to the not-so-dark-side. This lil� SUV is just much more refined than the Explorer was. Now, I�m not comparing this to a Beemer or anything here. Rather, it�s just things like smooth cruisin� at 85 on the highway (not that I do, mom) as well as the orgy of pertinent electronics and cupholders, that helped me feel more at home in the Jeep. Ok, I�m not gonna lie; the Limited trim helped too � the ladies just seem to love leather. The smell that accompanies the car of a delivery guy, though � that�s another story.

Ok, seriously, little after-thought here: � the Limited trim comes with painted bumpers. Bumpers. The part that�s intended to hit things (I mean, not <I>hit</I> things, but y�know, take some for the team). My bumpers look like they have some kind of primer herpes, man, from just the requisite unloading of the cargo area and stuff. Man, there are a casino�s worth of chips in the paint on my bumper. What a bad, bad idea.
