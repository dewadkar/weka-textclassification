            Chevy is still the best.  The 1500 Silverado is the best truck i have driven.  I had a 97 F-150 and my new Chevy beats it.  From the stylish new look to the powerful vortec engine, this is a great truck.  

Chevy did a great thing when they rolled this one on to the show room floor.  It was instantly a hit, and for a good reason.  The lowest model of the truck comes with a 200 horse power engine, which is more than enough power on a truck that size.

The affordable price is also another high point.  With a price like this it makes it easy for almost anyone to get this truck.  Also you can haggle with the salesman, but that is a different article.  The ride in this truck is the best.  Always smooth and comfortable.  The seats are also very nice, making a trip in the silverado a great experience.  

The one thing I don't like is that the 40/20/40 bench seat doesn't have a fold down console, but for $300 that can be changed.

All in all, I think this is the best truck out there right now.  A powerful truck that will get the job done.<br><br>
