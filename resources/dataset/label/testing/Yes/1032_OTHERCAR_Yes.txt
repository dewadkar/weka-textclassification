            I recommend this car to any woman who has a family, but doesn't want to drive a mini-van or a 4x4.  This car is roomy and drives great. I had a 4x4 and was tired of tearing my skirts by stepping up into the driver's seat.  I was determined to replace my 4-wheeler with a car that was as roomy as my Blazer, and everyone told me I wouldn't find one.  Well, I did and it was a lot less in price that I thought I would have to pay.  

I like the look, feel, and reliability of this car.  I have had it over a year and it still looks new and drives smooth.  I have had it in the shop once for schedule maintenance.  

I am also in love with the way the back seat folds down.  You can fit a big piece of plywood in the trunk with the back seats down. 

My only problem was the dial in the dash board were white when the rest of the control panel was black.  That took some getting use to, but I did and it doesn't bother me.  

I recommend the beige interior color because the grey felt too claustrophobic because the roof comes down so low above the windshield.  

I recommend it to anyone who need a good family car with a lot of style.<br><br>
