            I bought my Forester when my 9 year old sedan was stretching to reach 20 miles an hour.  I knew I wanted a SUV, and I knew I had great luck with the last Subaru I owned (the car I traded in wasn't a Subaru) 

Four months later I'm still as happy with my Forester as I was the night I drove it home.  It's perfect for short drives. It fits into the smallest parking spots with ease, handles as well as the XT I had 10 years ago, and doesn't seem to drink up a lot of fuel. It has plenty of get up and go for city life.  I love not having to climb up to get in and not having to lean down to remove baggage from the back. 

I use it to move computers and other supplies between my office and my clients' offices. I even picked up three friends from the airport (with luggage) and there was room for all of us. It would be nice if there was a little more leg space in the back seat area. 

I'm afraid that the Forester won't be comfortable for a long trip (which I'm planning on doing next month). I've only had the best of service from Subaru in the past and I expect that's what I'll find in the future.  If you buy a Forester, I hope you'll be as happy with yours as I am with mine. As a bonus, the Forester is rated very high for safety.<br><br>
