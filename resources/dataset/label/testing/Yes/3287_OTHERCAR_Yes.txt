            The Eagle Talon has always been one of my favorite cars, next to the Dodge Stealth that is.  The talon is the same car as a plymouth laser, and a Mistsubishi Eclipse with a few different options.  Many people will mach the talon because of the fact it is a foriegn car.  A compact car that has more power than a Mustang/Camero is nothing to be made fun of.  

The Talon first appeared in 1990 with 3 models, the base, the DL/ESi, and the TSi/AWD.  The base was a talon with no effects and a 1.8L SOHC I-4 with 92 horsepower and a 4-spped auto/5-speed manual. The base went from 1990 to 1994 when it�s engine was replaced with the same used in the Esi.  The DL/ESi had a 2.0L 16V DOHC 135 horsepower (140 in 95+) with a 4-speed auto/5-speed manual along with ground effect/spoiler as options.  And the highend was the TSi/AWD the tsi had a 195 horsepower(210 in 95+) 2.0L 16V DOHC intercooled turbo engine with a 4-speed auto/5-speed manual.  Also availbe on the TSi was the option of All Wheel Drive(AWD) which increased performance in acceleration and in handling.  There were two main body styles, the 1990 model(with a face lift in 92) and a complete redesign in 95. 

THe cars are fast, the Esi has enough power to race a V-6 mustang with no problem. The TSi can keep up with Most V-8 cars on the market, with a 0 to 60 in 6.4 seconds it can beat a 1984-98 Mustang GT off the line.  And AWD is always good in winter to have control with four spinning wheels.  The talon is a smaller version of a Dodge Stealth by offering many similar options.  These are fun cars for anyone who has the .... and money.

The Talon isn�t always a fun car, the ESi isn�t bad just watch the timing belt.  The TSi is a different story, the turbo engine must be babied to last over 100,000 miles. It is like most GM quad-fours, treat it badly it will stop.  The turbo must be allowed to catch up to the engine, the oil must be constant, and timing must always be right or the engine can die...

The car is a very fun car (the TSi is the best if you have time/money) It is great on gas and great on performance.  The ability to go when needed or turn a few heads is always fun.  And how many can say they have an American Rice burner...<br><br>
