            The new totally redesigned Sentra is a greatly improved version of Nissans compact car. Its loaded with standard options normally extras on most of its competitors. We chose the Sentra for 2000 after careful comparison of several subcompact cars in its class. The performance was better than the  rest. The engine is peppy and the brakes are quite good, as well as the fit and trim of the well laid out interior. We have only owned the car for a couple of weeks. Time will tell the story on reliability, however this car maker has a pretty good reputation for reliability.<br><br>
