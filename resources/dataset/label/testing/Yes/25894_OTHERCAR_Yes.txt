            I was looking for a car and only had two requirements on it.  get me from point a to b and not spend too much time at point G (Garage).  When i picked up the plymoth breeze it fit all of the above requirements but at cost.  The car has no, zip, zero, not if you needed to pickup power.  now i'm not one for racing a car off of the line but it would be nice not to have to slow down traffic just by trying to get the car up to speed after a Red Light.  Here is my rundown on the Breeze:

LOOKS

yes i know it shouldn't be first but hey take what you can get.  the breeze looks like a classic Sedan.  Not much flare too it a good bit of length with some loosely sporty lines to it.

DURABLITY

Car runs quite well at 50,000 miles with basic maintance on it.  really no complaints on it.  Change the oil when due and keep track of your fluids and this car is with you for the long haul.

ENGINE

The engine on the breeze is a 4 cyl.  good for gas bad for accel.  but again with normal maintance the engine seems to last quite some time.  i'm looking forward to a couple 100,000 miles on it before i even start to worry about things going wrong.

FEATURES

Good features throughout the car that are set up well.  everything is within easy reach and does not take long to learn everything about them.  (yes even the clock is easy to set).  Highway items are set right to the wheel (cruise and such) and given a shape that makes them easy to decide which is which without taking your eyes off the road.  

OVERALL VALUE

With a low ticket price on the car (got mine for $6,000 used) you really do get quite a bit out of the car.  although i do feel quite safe inside the car i do have a problem with the back end being a bit too high giving you a rather large blind spot but i've averted most of that by the side view mirrors and a little moving in the seat.  really all it takes is a bit of getting used too. 

GAS MILAGE

All though the car has great when it comes to highway miles i have found that in the city when you have to do a lot of acc the gas tends to suffer from it.  i've been able to drive to multi states on a single tank of gas on the highway but i couldn't go more then 5 days on a full tank of gas to work only 20 minutes from my house.

CONCLUSION

Living in Upstate NY there are few roads that you can go on without having to do some sort of hill climbing.  The car itself doesn't take them on too well the main thing is to be patient and not try to bury the pedel and with it the engine.  over all i would recommend this car...although i would say if you do live around hills be ready for the increase in gas usage and engine burn that is going to come along with it.
