            This is the best vehicle I ever bought.  It has gotten me anywhere I needed to go.  I love the Selec-Trac 4WD, the seats are excellent, with a good view of the road, although a little short, the Infinity sound system is excellent, and it is very powerful.  I have had many problems with my Jeep, but it was all under warranty.  The only problem that still exists is a strange steering feeling.  The back seat is also a very tight fit.  Otherwise this has been the best car purchase I have made in a long time.  I would recommend a Jeep to anyone, and when it comes time for a new car, it will be a Jeep.<br><br>
