            I went to purchase a Ford Explorer and bought the 2000 Eddie Bauer version. I love it!!! 

The gas mileage isn't the greatest, I am getting about 19 mpg and I drive mostly highway miles. (I'm also used to having mid-size cars which are very economical) 

The Eddie Bauer version comes with leather interior, 6 CD player, tape player, and enough FM buttons for you to program 10 stations. (FM1 and FM2) I really like the controls built in to the steering wheel for controlling the radio/music, as well as the climate control. You can change modes, turn up the volume, as well as make it warmer or cooler in the vehicle. There is a built in tissue holder, which turns out to be one of my favorite features! 

The drivers seat has many controls to help get the most comfortable position for driving. Not only forward and backward, but do you need your knees raised a little higher? Lower? Lumbar support is also a wonderful feature.

I love the tinted windows. The sides and back are a little darker than the front window tints, for security reasons. Power locks, keypad entry (no more worrying about locking your keys in the car!) power windows along with a window lock to keep little ones from rolling the back windows down while driving. Back doors have child proof locks, which you can either turn on or off.

A couple of really neat features are the temperature and direction indicator. It displays the outside temperature, either in farenheit or celcius and also shows you what direction you are headed. I love that!

There is an indicator panel which shows you the gas mileage you are getting, how many miles to empty (with quite a loooooong notice when you are running low on fuel). With one press of a button, you can check the levels of fuel, oil, windshield cleaner among others.

It handles wonderfully and has plenty of room for travelling. I feel extremely safe driving my 4 yr old around in it. My only real complaint about this SUV is that I don't like the way the back door opens. From the bottom and up...this has proved difficult when grocery shopping and you have a cart....but it's not a major hassle, just somewhat of an inconvenience. 

Update - December 18, 2000.

Well, I have started to have some trouble with the truck. The lighter stopped working, the back seat cup holder came off and the rear windshield wiper just decided to stop working. Luckily, all of these things are covered under the warranty, but it's not even a year old!<br><br>
