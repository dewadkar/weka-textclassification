            I've used my Nikon 950 over the past few months and find it to be remarkable.  Not only is the digital photo quality great, but the ease in taking the photos only make it more enjoyable.

The autofocusing mechanism is on the noisy side and probably eats up a good chunk of battery life, but has been completely reliable.  

I can testify to the fact how much better CompactFlash is (which is what the Nikon uses) than Smartmedia, or any other type of memory card.  For one thing, Compactflash is much cheaper for an equivalent memory size.  The market simply sells more of them and thus easier to buy with lower prices.  CompactFlash offers larger memory sizes as well.  Last, there are more compactflash devices to plug your cards into; this include laptops/pdas.  I find it awesome to plug the CF right into my laptop to view pictures instantly.  

Overall, the Nikon 950 is a fine digital camera that has a good number of years of continued use.
