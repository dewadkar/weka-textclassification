            Ahh, Toyota.  I lov my supra.

It is ironic that I think so fondly of my 1991 Toyota Supra, considering that it threw a rod right through the oil pan, and the engine is shot.  Left me stranded too.

Love that car, and only had it for 6 months.

I bought the car off ebay and when I picked it up, I was amazed that a car with 165K miles drove and sounded like a new car.  Better than new!  It handled like a dream, shifted smoothly (yes automatics suck, but I had no choice), the engine was quiet, everything worked, it was a blast.....

Except I wasn't mindful of the oil it was consuming-normal for an engine with this many miles.

Guess what?  Oil got too low and I started wearing out one of the rod bearings.  Long story short, I got about 15K miles out of it with a *bad* rod knock.  For those who don't know, a rod connects the piston to the crank shaft, and the bearing that holds the rod to the crank shaft wears out.  The end result is the rod (or the crank) breaking and the engine seizing.

Believe it or not, my supra still runs, even with the rod completely snapped!  Toyota quality!

I bought this car used, 10 years old with twice as many miles as any american car could do, and everything worked!

The electronic suspension control was incredible, and even though the car was as heavy as a tank, it cornered great and handled like a dream.  I would give anything to "swap" the engine out of my new 2002 camry, and put it in the supra.  The handling alone is worth it.

One problem with the supra is it has too little power to lug around it's 3800 pound girth.  200 horse just doesn't cut it.

Side note:  This car turns heads.  I know, because when I picked it up for the first time, I wasn't 10 miles from the seller's place, and a guy in a 3000GT wanted to race!  Wow, the supra legend lives on!
