            I bought my second Cabrio with 30,000 miles on it.  It has every available option with the exception of a power top and alloy wheels.  My first was a manual transmission and I went with the automatic on this one.  The elimination of the power top is not a drawback, it is so easy to put up and down, practically effortless, I can put it up and down faster than any power top convertible I have owned.  The one-touch up and down windows are a great feature! 
 
My roommate owns a Sebring convertible and after driving the Cabrio, when his lease is up, he is trading it in on a Volkswagen!  He is 6'2", not a small guy and fell in love with it the first time he drove it.  

The car gets good gas mileage, about 30 on the highway with the 4-speed automatic transmission.  Most of my commute is highway and it doesn't have any trouble picking up speed and getting out there.  

There is some road noise at high speeds, but that is not uncommon in convertibles.  This is my 4th convertible and by far my favorite!  I shopped around for new convertibles and for the features in this car, especially since it is considered the base model; it is a great buy!  The Miata, with less options was $3,000 to $5,000 more than the Cabrio, no the Cabrio is not a sports car, but I feel you get more for your money, especially if you are just looking for a drop-top car.
