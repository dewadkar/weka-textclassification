            I Have been in contact with two Cougar's in my life. The car that I learned to drive on was a 1978 Mercury Cougar. That car was a boat but it drove beautifully. It would glide along on the road despite it's size. It weighed about 2 tons and I couldn't see over the end of the hood but it cornered wonderfully for a big car. It was a lot of fun to drive and I will always have a soft spot in my heart for that car.
 Then there is the '89 Cougar that I encountered in college. One of my best friends drove this car and it was in beautiful condition. It ran beautifully and once he reattached the RAM air system it accelerated very smoothly and did not make nearly as much noise as it had at high speeds. It performed like a high performance car but was a luxury car. How many cars can you say that about?
 Mercury Cougars, especially the old ones, are huge though. The '89 Cougar is still about the same weight as the '78. They also sound like beasts. They make a lot of noise and roar out. If you are a person who likes doing burn outs you should also know better than to buy one of these, it has a V-6 and weighs about 4,000 pounds, they don't peel out very well. Although I have seen one do it.<br><br>
