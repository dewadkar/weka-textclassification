            Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the future of photography is in digital.  I knew this, so I saved up my money and went camera hunting.  I knew I wanted a Nikon because of the great experience I have had with them on my manual camera.  When I saw this camera at my local camera store, I was a bit turned of by its looks.  But I soon noticed the sense behind it.  This camera does everything!  The picture quality is excellent, the lens pivots around and makes shooting very easy.  Some of the more complicated functions of the camera are difficult to use, but a little manual reading will allow you to use any of them.  The camera uses  regulation cards, and you can change the resolution and picture size depending on how many pictures you want to get onto a card.  The only real downside is that the camera consumes batteries almost faster than you can buy them so I suggest that you be rechargables.  All in all a great camera.  It costs a little more than the others, but believe me, it is worth it!!!<br><br>
