            Do you love cars?  Do you subscribe to any car magazines or spend a lot of time talking to your friends about them.  Well if you do then don't go anywhere near the Ford Escort.  Don't get me wrong it's a great car, as far as I know.  It doesn't break down, and when I want to go someplace it will usually take me there.  It does seem to accelerate a little slow (as in almost not at all) on hills, but how often do a really need to pass someone on a hill?

No, this car is definitely not for you if you have something to prove.  It isn't going to impress anyone except maybe your mother and that's probably because she's being polite.  So you aren't going to look good and even worse you aren't going to go fast, can you live with it?

What you are going to do is get a car that will take you to the places you want to go for the price you want to pay.  And it will continue to take you places far into the future because it is fairly reliable machine. <br><br>
