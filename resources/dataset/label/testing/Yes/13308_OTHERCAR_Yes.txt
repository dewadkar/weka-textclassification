            This review is for the PASSAT WAGON. I bought this car in October 2001.  It had 200,000km on it.  It was fully loaded and had the 5 speed standard transmission.  I would not have bought it unless it was a 5 speed.  

The 3 speed automatics are the worst trany's during 1990-1995.  Stay away from them if possible.  The 5 speed will allow you to get the RPM's up to move this heavy car.  The automatics were prone to burning out due to the constant downshifting in mountains or hilly terrain.

The 5 speed is a great combo coupled to the 2.0 liter 16V motor.  It does however have a slight underpowered feeling off the line.  During highway speeds it's great.  Passing is easy when you downshift to 4th and at times you don't need to downshift at all.  In order for me to get the off the line power I wanted, I installed a Neuspeed Computer Chip, performance exhaust and a K&N air filter.  I considered a racing cam but this car was a highway commuter so that would have been counter productive.

The computer chip made a minor difference that was noticeable and my fuel consumption was way better.  I could get approx. 740km out of a tank of fuel which worked out to be 9.5L/100km.  That was one of the big plus's.  The 70 liter fuel tank.  The car used premium fuel because of the high KM's.

I would sleep in the car to while out on my windsurfing trips.  Tons of room on the roof to strap down 3 boards and all the gear inside with the seats down.  I would set up a tent and put all my gear in it and sleep in the car with a foam mattress.

The Passat Wagon is one of the few cars that the driver or passenger can have their front seat all the way back, and the leg room does not have to be sacrificed in the back.
  
I added 17" 40 series tires.  This makes for a harsher ride.  The Passat is slightly lower to the ground and almost looks like it was lowered with shorter springs.  The oil pan had a few dents in it when I bought it.  

I also painted the car because the paint was scratched and it had a few dents.  The interior is far superior than any other car in it's price range.  Total quality and durability.  It still looks new.  No rips or tears and the headliner was still intact.

I recently have sold the car with 250,000km on it.  It was time to move on to new.  It was hard to find a replacement car that was affordable to handle all my gear stopping short of an SUV.  I have since moved to the Toyota Matrix.  I have driven VW's for 20 years and will miss them.  I may return someday, but price drove me to Toyota.  VW's are just a little out of hand with prices right now.

Good luck!
