            After driving smaller cars all my life, I was anxious to actually take an SUV for a ride.  I didn't really know what to expect as far as the handling and overall ride was concerned.  Although I did have some minor complaints from the Isuzu Rodeo, I must say I was satisfied with the vehicle overall.

<b>Engine</b>
-The engine in the Isuzu Rodeo is quite powerful and makes it fun to drive.  It comes with a standard V6 which leaves no room for complaints.  For an SUV, the vehicle really moves with only a slight tap on the pedal.  Whether cruising around town or on the highway, I felt as though the engine always provided enough power for an enjoyable and fun ride.  Although I did not go &quot;off roading&quot; while driving it, i'm sure the Isuzu Rodeo would provide enough power to get out of the most difficult off road situations.

<b>Interior</b>
-This is the one difference which I loved the Isuzu Rodeo over my smaller cars I have always driven.  The interior of this SUV and large.  I know that over SUVs such as the Expedition and Suburban don't even compare to the Rodeo, but give me some credit, I have <i>always</i> driven small cars.  The interior is nice.  All the control panels are easy to read and control.  The standard stereo system comes with 6 speakers but is nothing to write home about.  It is average at best.  The backseats are also roomy and would allow two adults a comfortable ride for hours.  

<b>Exterior</b>
-The exterior of the Isuzu Rodeo is similar to all other SUVs.  It seemed lower to the ground than some others, but is still a lot higher then a car.  (Obviously)  The full size spare time is mounted to the back door/window.  The window opens by clearing the tire with no problem so if you need to stick something out the back window, you can. 

<b>Safety</b>
-The safety features with the SUV are nothing out of the ordinary.  It comes with the standard two front airbags.  I have not seen any crash test results on how the Isuzu Rodeo compares to other SUVs.

<b>Price</b>
-You can't beat the price of the Isuzu Rodeo compared to other SUVs.  The lower end models begin at $17,000.  Although you will not get some of the same features found in a Suburban, you can't argue that the price is incredibably better.  You should also have no trouble arguing the price down with an Isuzu dealer.  They are anxious to sell as many of these SUVs as possible.  Wait for your price...

<b>Reliability</b>
-I do not own this car so I can't comment on reliability from a personal standpoint.  I know people who own this SUV and they have had no problems so far.  Consumer Reports rates Isuzus overall as &quot;in the middle of the road&quot; when it comes to reliability.  They are not Hondas, but they will not break down every other week either.<br><br>
