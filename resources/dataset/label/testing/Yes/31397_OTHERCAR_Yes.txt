            I took delivery of my New 2000 Alero GLS On June 13 2000.
This is my first new car in 16 years. My last new vehicle is a 1984 Cadillac Cimarron that is still going strong with 281,000 miles.This car refuses to die, but I finally decided it is time for a new car. I knew I could not settle for a stripped down version. I also felt that I wanted to stay with GM because of past successes.I wanted something out of the ordinary. I considered the Grand Prix and the Buick Regal.The Alero was on my list of cars to check out. It so happens that I test drove the Alero first. I knew at that point that this was going to be my next new car.I chose the GLS model simply because leather and sun roof are on my must have list- that way I only needed to add a sunroof.I was impressed with the list of standard features.Just about everything one could want.Plus things I never even knew existed for example, battery run down protection- ever accidently leave the interior light on only to find a dead battery? This car turns it off after a certain period. The 4 wheel independent suspension, variable power steering, and 4 wheel ABS disk brakes all work well together. I like the way it stays glued to the road.I have the GM 3.4 L V6 in my Alero.What I like most about driving this car is the raw power. I can't describe it any other way. I heard it called &quot;peppy&quot;.If you are only expecting &quot;peppy&quot; with the V6 you are in for a surprise.It's more like awesome.Just for the record The Alero GLS accelerates quicker from 0-60 mph and the quarter mile than the V6 Camry, Accord plus VW Passat GLS,Mitsubishi Galant ES,Chevy Malibu LS,Mazda 626,Chrysler Cirrus Lxi (and Family), Ford Contour SE (and family) Nissan Altima SE,and the Subaru Legacy SUS. Most people I meet want to know where it is made  . . good old USA . . actually Lansing, MI. where Oldsmobile has been making fast cars . .(remember the 442?) for over 100 years. I call the Alero one of the world's best kept automotive performance secrets.
If you are looking for a Fun Car / that is put together very well. .that has lots of good looks and performance . ..then get yourself an Alero,  but you better get yourself a top rated radar detector while you are at it.That's what I did.  <br><br>
