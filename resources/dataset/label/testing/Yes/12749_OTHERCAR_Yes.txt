            If you think about it,  there are really two types of photographers -- those who take their time to pose subjects, use advanced light settings and use high power zoom and wide angle lenses to make every picture perfect; and those who like to take alot of pictures of events &quot;as-they-happen&quot; to capture memories of daily life.

If you're the first type of photographer, you'd best look elsewhere, but if you're the second type of picture-taker --  a ubiquitous photographer -- that likes to have a REALLY small camera ready at hand to take lotsa  pictures whenever the mood strikes....then stop looking and buy this camera!

You cannot find a smaller or more stylish digital camera,  let alone one with a film-quality 2.3 megapixel resolution, will work with either a PC or Macintosh, and is less than $500!!!!  For a few extra dollars you can get a little belt pouch so you can have your friendly Fuji on you at all times (after all, you never know when the baby or kitten will do something that is so cute you just HAVE to get it on your Zing.com or Photopoint.com album).

The camera has BOTH an LCD viewscreen as well as an old-fashioned look-through optical viewfinder.  If you're like me, you're so used to putting a camera up to your face to take a picture that holding it out to use the LCD is awkward.  No problem with the MX-2700!

It also has some pretty sophisticated in-camera controls that let you delete pictures, add some cool special effects,  and take 2X digitally zoomed pictures.  However, if you're a ubiquitious photographer like myself, you'd rather take one second to move a little closer and snag your shot than to take half-a-minute to switch the zoom.

I STRONGLY recommend paying the money for the largest  SmartMedia card you can find.  My 32MB card lets me take 36 pictures at the highest resolution...and believe me when I tell you the  pictures really are photo quality with photo paper off my Epson 740.

On my Blue &amp; White G3 Macintosh, I had to use the $15 shareware program Cameraid to enable me to use the camera with my USB ports with Kensington's $40 USB PDA Adapter.  Download from the Serial Cable is REALLY slow, so you might just want to spend the $50 or so and get a USB card reader for the camera.

With the camera in hand, you can start taking tons of pictures to take advantage of the free print offers available on many of the web-based photo album sites (e.g., ofoto, photoaccess, etc...) and save money on photo paper.

If you like taking alot of pictures to keep and share your memories, and have been thinking about a digital camera.....STOP THINKING!  Follow Nike's advice and just DO it!  And do it with this amazing little camera!<br><br>
