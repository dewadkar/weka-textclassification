            If you don&#146t have a digital camera and you get a digital camera from someone as a gift, of course you&#146ll be happy because these things are cool and expensive, right?

Wrong.  There are really cheap digital cameras out there; in fact the last cell phone I purchased <I>came with a free digital camera</I>, which I promptly gave away.  The HP PhotoSmart 215xi, which I&#146ve owned for over a year, is not that cheap, but its price means you cannot expect a whole lot of features, and to be perfectly fair, this is an alright purchase for the price.

The first thing people tend to worry about when purchasing a new digital camera is the resolution; this measure is akin to the processor speed on PCs and horsepower on car engines &#150 it&#146s what the companies advertise first.  Basically, any camera with a resolution of lower than 2.0 megapixels will produce photos with quality noticeably below those from cameras that use film.  The HP Photosmart 215xi has a resolution of 1.31 MP, so there ya go &#150 don&#146t use this for photography class.

As upsetting as the picture quality is, by far the worst thing about this camera is the battery life.  This product does not have its own rechargeable battery and must use four AA batteries to operate.  HP was kind enough to include four no-name brand AA batteries with the purchase and they will last you for maybe forty photos, <I>if</I> you use the LCD display conservatively.  Do yourself a favor if you&#146re going to buy this camera and buy a <I>whole bunch</I> of Duracell Ultras wholesale because you&#146re going to need them.  To compound matters, it is very easy to accidentally turn on this camera and this has driven me insane more than once because I&#146ll find four high-quality batteries drained because I put my camera in my backpack and it turned itself on in there.  You can use an AC outlet, but HP includes an ad in its instruction manual to buy the adapter from them <I>separately</I> &#150 I hate it when conniving companies come up with scams like that.

However, HP is generous enough to include a cute little wrist-strap that I struggled trying to attach to my camera; the instructions were no good and I ended up throwing the strap out &#150 besides, a man using a wrist strap is like a man carrying a purse.  The rest of the instructions, on how to use the HP PhotoSmart 215xi and its limited features, are pretty good.  The interface HP implements with this camera is delightfully simple: it basically has two buttons once its turned on, one that takes the picture and another that&#146s like a mousewheel you can press to bring up a menu and scroll up or down to choose from the options.

Taking the picture is literally a snap as well.  The camera default is set to automatic flash, focus, and exposure &#150 as with all laymen cameras, you just point at something, hold the &#147take picture&#148 button halfway until a light comes on indicating the camera is focused, and then press that button all the way down to take the picture.  The time the camera takes to focus is reasonable, but, for some reason, the time it takes for the flash to &#147recharge&#148 is ridiculous sometimes while at other times it&#146s instant.  The auto-everything features will rarely produce pictures exactly the way you want them to look and more experienced photographers may want to tinker with the flash, focus, and exposure manually.  Perhaps HP realized that professional photographers will steer clear of this product because the company made customizing your own settings very tedious.  Most settings are automatically restored to default after you turn off the camera and the self-timer mode (for those adorable group photos) is reset to off <I>after every photo</I>.

The photo storage device included with the HP PhotoSmart 215xi is 4 MB, which isn&#146t much.  There are three photo-quality settings you can choose from and the low one should be avoided.  The middle one (the default) is okay if you want to put your pictures on the web (just be ready to resize the image considerably smaller than the original) and the highest setting should be the only one used if you want to attempt putting your pictures on an actual photo.  The camera tends to underestimate the storage device&#146s capacity, saying it can store five, ten, and twenty pictures respective to the low, middle, and high photo-quality settings when the numbers are closer to ten, twenty, and forty, which is enough for me, since you can quickly and easily scroll through the pictures you&#146ve taken and delete the less desirable ones with the LCD display.

Finally, just to wrap things up, the 2x zoom is rather lame, but what can you expect with camera that only costs around a bill?  And, as always with digital cameras, if you want to connect it to your computer, you&#146ll need one with a USB port.  This camera comes with its own cable but I recommend getting a device that allows you to connect your photo-storage device directly to your computer so you don&#146t have to leave the camera on and drain your precious batteries when uploading images.

My dad has a mid-range Cannon Powershot A40, and my friend has an insane 5.0 MP Olympus Camedia C-5050, so I&#146ve tried far better things in the digital camera world.  Nonetheless, this is still a great starter camera because it&#146s cheap and will still do the things someone should expect their first digital camera to do, just not that well.
