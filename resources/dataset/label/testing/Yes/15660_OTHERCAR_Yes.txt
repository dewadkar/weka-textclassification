            Have owned the Sony MVC-FD91 camera for almost a year.  It handles well, the diskette feature is simple to use and the 14X zoom is great.  Amazed at the low light capabilities of the camera and the sharp resolution.  The camera is durable, has been dropped, taken on many trips and survived without a repair.  Having the capability of making a short MPEG movie means you can email your friends single pictures or a movie clip right away.  They can view the clips you send them in their browser.  I watch my friends with other types of Digital cameras that require attachments to serial ports to download pictures.  They are amazed at how simple and fast I can retrieve pictures with the diskette storage solutions Sony uses.  I can't wait for the future model of this camera, good job Sony!!!<br><br>
