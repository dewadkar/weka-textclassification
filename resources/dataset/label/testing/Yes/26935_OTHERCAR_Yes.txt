            I guess having a camry for me as a first car is a laugh for most of my friends. But for the next 2 years, i think im going to hold on to it. So far, the V6 camry has been running really good. The performance of the car is awesome for a sedan. The V6 power gave me many opportunities to race civics(i dont like civics...at all)and beat them. The smooth turns and the great handling has also brought me good things for when im late for work and i have to get through busy traffic. Ive been driving it since summer and i spent a lot of money on gas. Gas has been the only major problem for me with this car. Last week, all the back lights(park, brake, and reverse)blew out. I thought it was the fuse but later on i found out that i accidently ripped the cord when i was loading my equipment in the trunk. When my parents bought this camry, they got it used for 13,000. My dad's camry(after he bought his, he liked it so much he got another...go figure!)cost him around 20,000 and it was 1999 with a 4 cylinder. That was a big mistake from the start. The 4 cylinder is very slow especially on the pick up. Acceleration is horrible and when im flooring it, it sounds like im pushing the engine to the limit where its gonna blow. Now he wants a SUV (he should have thought of that when he first bought it) I drive the V6 which i like more. Its really comfortable when it comes to the back seats. It can get pretty straining driving for a long time because your back gets all cramped up but i guess thats normal. I guess you can say its a luxury car with the wood trim on the interior. With its classiness of rear cup holders to a matrix green astray(i love that color), you got it all! My point is that if your going to get a camry and your looking for a nice, dependable car...get a V6! trust me on this. You might have to pay a little more with the new 2002 camrys but i think you will get what i mean when you test drive both cylinders....I Gotta hit the streets, look for some civics to race..peace and good luck!!
