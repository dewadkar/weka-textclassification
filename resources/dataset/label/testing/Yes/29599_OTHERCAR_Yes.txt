                 I miss my Miata. I had a new one for about 1 1/2 years but had to give it up because I was in graduate school and couldn't afford it. At the time, there was not the plethora of used ones under $5000 that you can find nowadays.
     Anyway, enough of my sob story. This was, hands down, the best car that I have ever had the pleasure of driving. From the time that I test drove it and almost steered into oncoming traffic because the steering was so much tighter quicker than my Eclipse, to the three 1300 mile trips that I made in her, I loved every second of that car.
    Yes that's right, I made three 1300 mile trips in a Miata. One was broken up into two days, one took 22 hours with half the trip being in fog and rain, and the last one taking me 17 hours and 17 minutes. The second and third trips were both driven straight through by myself, only stopping for gas. You will hear many people say that the Miata isn't that great on the interstate, but I don't know what kind of trips they were doing. I found the seat to be so incredibly comfortable and supportive I felt as if the seat was designed by another 5'10", 140 lb guy. The only down side about any of those trips was the 8-10 hours spent driving through rain and fog, especially when it's the last 10 hours of a 22 hour trip. After hearing the rain noise on the ragtop roof for about 7 hours, I started to lose my mind. Granted, much of the insanity was brought on by sleep deprivation, but the rain didn't help.
     As far as storage space goes, it's common knowledge that you don't get a Miata if you have lots of stuff to carry, so I'm not going to cry about the small storage space. Instead I will say that I was able to carry 2 trombone cases, other miscellaneous items AND a passenger, without having to put anything on the pax's lap. There is plenty of storage space if you are daring and creative. The rear window ledge is surprisingly roomy.
     The top was SO incredibly easy to operate that my friend and I were able to put it down AND UP while going down the interstate. You won't find instructions on how to do this in the owner's manual, but you get creative when it starts to rain while you are on your way to the Grand Canyon.
     Engine: never a problem. Transmission and shifting: everything you hear is true. Handling: SAWWWEEEET! Top speed: less than what you think, but it doesn't matter, you shouldn't be driving that fast anyway unless you are trying to escape nuclear annihilation. Acceleration: again, not what you would expect, and you can definitely tell a difference when there is a passenger in the car. Camaraderie: Every Miata owner on the road, shares the same passion for the car that you do, and you almost always get that smile from the other owners.
     To sum up, I am looking into getting another one, if I can convince my wife that it is a great commuter car. True there is no back seat for kids, dogs, etc., but with prices for used ones being so low these days, I can still get one and still have money left over to by a "family" car for around town.
     Oh, one last thing. Mine was a manual transmission. I wince when I see an automatic Miata. As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to get an automatic is if you have only one arm. If you have two arms, learn to drive a stick. The short throw shifter is part of the Miata experience.
