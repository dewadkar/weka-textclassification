             Nikon Coolpix 950 is, in my Epinion, top rated! This digital camera lets you take great pictures with ease. It features aperture priority, shutter priority, as well as continuous shooting mode at up to 3 frames per second (while letting you create the effects you want).

This camera has a high resolution (1600x1200) and a basic resolution (1024x768, 640x480) along with a compact-flash memory card (8MB card included), 38 to 115mm (3x optical zoom), 4x digital zoom and a rotating lens.

The Nikon can store anywhere from 1 to 32 photos and has single/continues AF and manual focus (for those who wish to be daring).  It has an external flash capability, burst shooting mode and both an optical and LCD viewfinder (2&quot; LCD screen).

The Nikon is very light weight (around 12 to 13) and works with Windows 95/98, NT 4.0 and Macintosh OS 7.1 or later.

When I purchased this camera for $780+, it came with serial cables, video cable, 8MB compact flash card, 4xAA batteries, soft case, strap, lens cap and a 1-year warranty (I suggest that with anything digital, always go with the extended warranty).

All in all, this camera has been a dream! It has been durable and has given me a perfect &quot;shot&quot; everytime!  I would recommend it to anyone.
