            1999/2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS V6, Light Moss

[Week of Test Drive]
When someone asks you, what do you drive?  If you answered Hyundai with quiet voice, you are not alone.  After you answered, you point all the good things about your Hyundai, you still feel bit awkward.  This is typical scenario that Hyundai Owners go through.  However, over time this will go away.

[Details]
New Sonata is very good car that comes from Hyundai, onc of the South Korean conglomorate who produces RAM that goes into your computer to the Engine that goes on your next flight with Boeing Jet.  The car is surprising good and has good quality.  Let me tell you what I mean�

[Interior]
The Sonata is very roomy.  It has nice front and back seat.  One I test drove had very comfortable and nice leather seating.  Interior dome light is surprising bright.  Moonroof is very easy to operate.  Steering wheel feels very good, comfortable, and easy to maneuver.  Power seat is also easy to operate.  Everything is within easy reach.  These easy operation make living with Sonata very easy and comfortable

[Exterior]
The Sonata is bit odd looking and it has look of Toyota Camry but overall, I like way the new Sonata looks.  It has a pleasing look and if you don�t like it, it will grow on you.  Sonata has nice wheels.  Like interior dome light, Sonata�s headlight is very bright.  

[Safety]
Previous Hyundai Sonata did do very well on those infamous Dateline MSNBC's off set crash test with Lisa Thompson.  This year, Sonata has improved a lot in term of safety.  Car feels a lot more solid.  Sonata's suspension is some where between Camry's &quot;Don't drive me too Hard&quot; to Accord's &quot;Punch it baby!&quot;   Many people do not know this but Sonata has second generation air bag.  What this means is that when child is placed on the front seat, air bad does not get deployed.  This is very smart thing and very few family sedan offers it.  Sonata also comes with Side impact air bad, which is nice safety feature.  The side impact air bag also deactivates itself if the front passager is child or too light, 66LB.  The side impact air bag and second generation air bags are standard.  On Accords, Maxima, Taurus, or Camry, they are either not available or an option. 

[Driving]
At stand still, the Sonata�s V6 2.5L 170-horsepower engine is very quiet.  It Toyota Camry quiet.  When you step into the gas paddle, you will notice how smooth this car operates.  It�s unreal for any Hyundai experience I had.  The Sonata climbs to highway ramp quickly.  However, this is where you notice the noise.  My friend drives Maxima and another friend drives Camry.  Sonata isn�t quiet as Maxima or Camry.  It has road, wind, and tire noises coming into the cabin.  However, it isn�t to say that this is loud or bad car but if your priority to have quiet car, Camry and Maxima are quieter.  However, I think Sonata is quieter than Honda Accord.

When I slowed Sonata, it seems like the car slowed faster.  I was told later that Sonata down shifts the gear, which I thought was smart.   Sonata corners well, too.  It�s very nice car to drive.

[Hyundai Reality]
One of the assuring things about Hyundai Sonata is that the car feels good.  It feels like it has been well thought out.  I test drove Honda Accord, I can say that Sonata is very good compare to Honda Accord but less expensive.  Also note that Sonata is bit quieter than Honda Accord.  Hyundai Sonata also costs thousands less than Accords, which goes around $25,000 for fully loaded Accord and Sonata cost about $21,000 when it is fully loaded.  Hyundai now offers 5 years warrantee, which is the best warrantee that any automotive company offers today.  I would choose this car over any US-Made cars.  However, if I have to buy Sonata or Maxima, I would definitely choose Maxima but Maxima cost more.  Hyundai suffers from poor resale value.  I recently traded my Hyundai Elantra that was in good condition, I got only 30% of the value after 2 � years.  Driving Sonata is good when you consider that you don�t have to pay as much at front.  However, if you want to trade this car with others, reality hits you and you tell yourself, maybe I shouldn�t have bought Hyundai.  It�s really tough call.  Because of the resale value, buying other cars is better than buy Hyundai line of cars.  It�s sad that such a good car like Sonata GLS suffers because the brand images.

[Update 01/11/2000]
There is no major changes for Sonata.  There was a rumor that Sonata may get bigger engine but did not happen.  Sonata's sale improved dramatically.  1999 was the best Hyundai year ever.  I think this proves that Hyundai brand is gaining respect that they wished for 10 years.  

For 2000 Hyundai Models, Accent and Tiburon were redesigned.  And Newly SUV called Santa Fe is coming here for spring  or spring of year 2000.  Hyundai also announced that they will bring Granduer XG into US on fall of 2000.  
Hyundai is expected to sell close to 200,000 cars during year 2000, if not more.
