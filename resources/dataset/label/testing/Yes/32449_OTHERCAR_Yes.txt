            I got my car about a month ago and ever since I have always been trying to find reasons to get in it.  I have the RS (base model) but lets put it this way it is a great car with good gas mileage.  I haven't got more than 26 &amp; 2/3mpg but that is because I have been doing a lot of hard driving.  The car has great acceleration 6.92 seconds for a 0-60 time.  It handles good up to a point, but that is because of the soft suspension it has.  The ride is great due to the soft suspension it has, especially when you go over speed humps at 30mph you can hardly feel it.  Another good point is that this car has many different mods that you can get so there is no end to how much you can do to this car to make it totally different from the factory look and feel.  The car doesn't start to get noticeably loud over the radio until you hit around 3500rpm's which is fine because you are enough below that at highway speeds (50-65mph).  There is a more than enough front seat room for anyone but the back isn't good for people over 5'10&quot;.  The trunk is big and spacious (13.3 cubic feet) which is more than enough for me.  Then there is the shifting the throw is short and it &quot;snaps&quot; into place giving you great piece of mind that you know you have it in gear.  The car is also low to the ground but you can't tell that from the inside until you go to step out and the ground is about 5 inches from where you had your foot from the inside.  The only thing that I don't like about this car is that it has a large blind spot due to the big pillars in the rear of the car, but then I could always get those small circular mirrors on the side mirrors.  But if you don't believe it is a good car lets just put it this way it is a Honda made car and you know you will get a good car from them.<br><br>
