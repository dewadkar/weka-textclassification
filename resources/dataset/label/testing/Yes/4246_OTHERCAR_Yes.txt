            On the 13th of November 1999 I had an idea. I needed to get myself some sort of transportation because it was beginning to rain out here in 'Sunny' California.

Motorcycles don't really like the rain, and I plan on keeping my bike for a while, I decided to go to a friend of mine's car dealership and see what he could come up with.

I test drove a couple of the cars on his lot and found only one to be satisfactory. By the time all was said and done I was zipping around town (literally) in my new 1991 BMW 318is. (Well, new to me anyway.)

Man I tell you what, this car is sweet. I don't even care if it is 9 years old, the body is still straight. The seats can twist and contort into all sorts of cool positions. Everyone from myself (5'7&quot;) to my large friends (6'3&quot;-6'6&quot;) can easily fit in the front seats with a couple pulls of a lever (driver and passenger).

The interior is all moo-cow leather (some imitation in places like the doors). This means no itchy cloth or sticking to vinyl when it gets all hot and nasty like it does constantly during the summer. (That's why they call it 'Sunny' California.

Five of the six windows are tinted giving it a real 'pimp-daddy' look. It's stylish without saying &quot;Hey! Look at me! I'm an obnoxiously trendy MOFO with too much money on my hands&quot;. Well maybe I do have the money... but that's a different story.

I must say that it is also one of the fastest cars I have ever been in. I have driven a 6-cylinder Fiero, but is shook violently at high-speed.

This thing is solid as a rock at 110mph.

**** DISCLAIMER ****

I only drove it at 110mph on an private road in the middle of the day, no rain, clear visibility, no drugs or alcohol, and only for about 2 minutes. I do not suggest you doing the same unless you are willing to pay the consequences, which can be very dear indeed.

DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME WITH YOUR AMERICAN CAR!

**** END DISCLAIMER ****

With all else said it is a super-fly car. I cannot get over how gosh-darn cool it is, since all I've ever driven has been American made. American cars are nice, but this thing is *really* nice. I just love the way they thought of *everything* when they built this machine.
