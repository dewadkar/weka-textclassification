            Best opinions are easier to identify by the age of the person who is writing. I'm a male, who's almost turning 21.

When I started driving at 17, I use to drive a 1994 Ford Escort Wagon. Yippee! Hey come on, share my entusiasm. Anyways, I'll start of quickly, but the escort was good. But not great... come last year, May 1999, we get the Protege.....

Our other Vehicle was a Toyota Van 1982 I believe. We traded that in for the Protege. At the same time, we traded in a 1996 Mazda MPV, for the last, but new 1998 MPV (Mazda stopped making 4x4 after 1998). So hense we got a deal. 

Only thing was we wanted to get a Black Protege, and not pure black, a Pearl color black. If you look up close to it, you'll find fine specks of blue/brown which make the paint job absolutly original, yet from far away it looks black. Also we wanted manual. I mean come on, going from a escort to a Protege, you wanna gain a little more speed, and power! So we wanted the Manual, also, we wanted the Touring Edition LX. So if you put all 3 of those together, well you don't get many. We actually ended up waiting a few weeks, because the only type of its kind was in Toronto, so they had it sent down here for us.

Wow. But wait... those hubcaps.. horrible, ugly! The manager took us into the garage, and there underneath a tarp, was a brand new set of 5 spoke mags, with nice 15&quot; tires on em. Very stylin, also, these tires weren't as thin as the normal stock tires, they were stylin. 

So there we have it, all that and no car. Finally it arrives, but I happened to be in England, coming home, I see the car sitting in the driveway. WAY WAY different looking any Protege on the road, at the time, and even today.

So the car.. its great. I'm about 5'11&quot; and i can fit perfectly in the car with room to spare. It seats 5 adults pretty good (depending on the size in the back seats, but even still, great leg room, and head room. Sound wise its great. Cd player, and the speakers sound great for factory, but once again, i'm comparing this a escort.

I've now been driving the car for some time, so i've got a lot to write about it. First, I changed the air filter to a K&amp;N Airfilter. Whoop! I didn't think i'd notice much, but I did. The car itself has 124HP, and speaking with K&amp;N via email, they told me i'd get at least a 4-6HP increase. I'd say for $45CAN its a cheap upgrade to the car. Also I ended up at my Mazda Assessory store, and got a nice set of Pilot Fog Lights installed at the bottom of the car. It looks So sharp! As I mentioned before, in all of BC, I have yet to see a car like mine.

Being almost 1-1/2 on the car, its still running fine. I've got not a single problem with the car, and take it for Mazda's Checkups at the recent intervals (5000km, 10000km, 16000km, 24000km...). I guess the only problem i do have is the tires. Yes I mentioned i got great tires, and mags, but they are SUPER SUPER wild in the summer, and nice dry roads, but once that rain comes, I can say byebye. They slip and slid, which i guess i have to deal with, but its not too bad. I'll be getting newer tires for the winter, because there's no way i can deal with them thru Vancouvers rain.

I guess the only other thing I want to get on the car is a stress bar, which will make little difference, but make the engine look pretty nice, and I also want to get some side markers on the car. I've seen them on the new Jetta's and BMW's, and they look great, and I want to put those on it. 

All in all, the Protege is a great car. For those who don't need a serious sports car, and need something, small, econmical (get at least 500km to a full tank, which is good with gas prices these days). Its a great city car, and thats what I use it for, but I do do some driving which is at least 1-2 hours, and it seems great for that use, comfortwise.  I have yet to take it on a nice Road Trip, but i'm sure that Protege would live up to the test. Mazda lives up the name with all their vehicles, and my next Opinion will be for the MPV, hopefully intime before we trade that in for their New Tribute. Get in, and enjoy your ride.
