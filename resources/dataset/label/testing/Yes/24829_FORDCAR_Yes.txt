            One of my friends just bought a new Ford Mustang for around $20,000.  I have been in it and it is a terrific car.  He also loves it and has had nothing but good things to say about his new automobile.  The only thing I don't like is that the back seats are a bit cramped.  Ford should really work on this and it will become a premier driving machine.  This car is a great buy for $20,000 with leather and other accessories.  I definitely recommend you buy this is black or silver, they are the two nicest colors.  Overall, this is a very smooth ride, and I belive the Ford Mustang is a bit underrated.<br><br>
