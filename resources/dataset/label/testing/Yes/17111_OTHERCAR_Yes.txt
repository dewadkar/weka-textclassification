            After many months of research, I bought the 1999 ML 320.  There are a few things that I wish they had done better in design, like the sunroof is too loud (when closed) at highway speeds, the rear room is just not quite sufficient, and there is way too much plastic inside.  I completely believe in the engine and the transmission and the suspension system.  The interior is my only complaint.

Driving the ML is a dream.  Gas mileage is good at 20+.  Reliability is good, but I have had a few issues in the first 13,000 miles.

Overall, if I did not have 3 kids under age 4, I would keep my ML, no questions.  Because of my new addition, I have to sell and get a bigger SUV :o(.  If anyone is interested in buying a used ML (13,000 miles) with M1, Sunroof, and Bose System, please email me (bleasdell@hotmail.com).<br><br>
