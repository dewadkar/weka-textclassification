I love this little digital cam! It does everything a point and shoot digital camera should do and more. For me, a point and shoot camera should be small and light so that it can conveniently go with me everywhere. That's the power of any point and shoot camera actually. It goes with you in your daily life and subsequently you get shots that you could not get with other larger cameras either because it would be too conspicous, or too inconvient to carry with you. 
The S400 camera is barely larger or heavier than a pak of cigarettes and even fits in a shirt pocket with relative ease.

I originally had an S50 but ended up getting rid of it because it was too big and heavy and the manual controls on it were cumbersome to use. In the end, the manual controls on the S50 were not worth having to carry around such a brick-like camera. The S50 often ended up staying at home or in the car and I missed out on shots because I did not have the camera with me.

The images out of the S400 suprisingly enough, look even better to me than those out of the S50. I can't really explain why this is considering that the S50 is a full 1 megapixel higher than the S400. 

I don't miss having the full manual controls that the S50 has at all. When I had the S50, I found that I hardly ever used the manual controls anyway because they are a bit cumbersome. I actually longed for more ease and simpleness, which frees one up to take pictures more spontaneously. So the small size and convenience of the S400 more than outweighs the lack of full manual controls for me. And the S400 does have manual mode where you can dial in some settings manually, just not f-stop and shutter speed. Further, you can often achieve the same effects as if you had full manual controls just by knowing how to set the S400. For example, if I want to shoot an outdoor portrait with a shallow depth of field (so the background will be blurry), I would set the camera's ISO to 50 and then meter off of something fairly dark (like the shade) while holding down the shutter down halfway to lock the exposure and recompose to the subject to take the picture.

I took about 300 images before I had to recharge. My old one was an AA battery kind. Never buy ones using AA. Life will be short. Times when you are about to take the most important pics, you're dead already.

My only grumble (apart from the tacky chromed lens ring) is with "Image Gateway" service Canon offers with the camera. Hiden away within the long text of the users agreement is a clause tantamount to Canons unlimited right to use images uploaded there, so use at your own risk. 

To conclude, I am very happy with this camera because it does everything a small point and shoot digital camera should do, yet it is quite small, light, feels sturdy (metal case) and has very pleasant ergonomics both with regard to the layout of the controls as well as to the on screen menu functions.
