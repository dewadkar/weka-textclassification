            Originally, I was going to purchase one of these last year for my wife. She wound up getting a Lexus ES 300 instead. I never forgot how nice the test drive was and a year later decided to get one for myself. I'm glad I waited the year because the 2004's come with the same engine used in the Lexus RX 330. (3.3 liter 230 hp). I purchased the car through carsdirect.com for 27075 dollars. The only catch to that was the dealer was 60 mile away. I called local dealers to try and get a price match, but they couldn't. So I guess I'm giving carsdirect a plug as well. (By the way the whole transaction took 20 min.) It came worth three different packages, prefered, appearance and towing. Also has a sunroof.
My son plays hockey and the ease of putting his hockey bag and sticks in the back are a definite plus. Lots of cargo space with the third row seat folded forward. With the seated folded up; there is room for groceries. The seat itself is good for either midgets or kids smaller than 4 feet. My 8 year old was quite comfortable back there. The second row seats are comfortable as well with a decent amount of legroom, from what my wife and sister say. The front seat is power and the seating positions make road fatigue and back strain a thing of the past. You also have a very good view of the road and the radio and dash knobs are all accessible without any strain.
The ride is equivalent to Camry, which makes sense. The chassis of the SUV is indeed a Camry, which is a good thing. SUV's normally drive like crap where as this one is quite smooth.
The engine is powerful and quiet. I haven't checked the gas mileage yet but for the power it delivers, it&#146s worth it. I know the quality of the vehicle is outstanding as I read as many reviews as possible before buying the truck. It's a Toyota with a Lexus engine, no brainier will return to update this as I get more experience and time to actually judge a lot of the things that I read. But for now, I strongly recommend the Toyota Highlander.
