            I love my Honda.  Love it!  My boyfriend and I bought our first car a year ago, a 96 Civic LX and we love it. When we first talked about buying a car, it seemed like years away.  We were both young and in school but we were also doing a lot of skiing, biking and other traveling up north so we thought 'the amount we spend on rentals we can spend on a car'.  Plus, I was thoroughly sick of public transit, ready to break down on those final bus rides.  The more we thought about, the further we were from deciding to wait. When we bought it, used, we drove off the lost and the heating fan starting making horrible noises and we thought "Great!  We've just bought a lemon!"  We went back in and demanded to get it fixed no charge.  My temper flared and the dealers couldn't say no.  Actually, they were extremely helpful and kind (4M Car Sales for those in Toronto, Canada).  Since that, which we thought was a bad omen, nothing but a good reliable car. We've just passed the 100K mark so the expected things are asking for repair... new timing belt, new cv boots and new tires.  But we planned for this and it's not specific to our car.  All cars take work!  
We paid  $10,000 Can. which may have been a bit much considering we have the basic model but in terms of its necessary features versus its extras, it was well worth it.  So we don't have extras.  It's not a luxury car.  The seats become uncomfortable after long drives, there's no CD player and those hot summer days are fairly damaging without air conditioning but it other than that, we couldn't have asked for a better first car.  It's great on gas, great heating system, comfortable most of the time, small enough to fit into most spots, big enough that you don't clutch the wheel in fear on the highway... It's a great economy car. We heard horror stories of lemons and worse and we went in with some fear but, on the other hand, we did our research and many realized that, for our price range, the civic was the best deal.  And it is.  I recommend it to any and all first-time buyers and beyond.  I'm planning on keeping this baby for a long, long time!
