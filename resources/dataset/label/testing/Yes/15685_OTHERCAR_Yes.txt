            If you're looking for a smaller passenger (yet luxury) vehicle, then the <i>Mercedes Benz C320</i> is definitely worth investigating.  I've test drove both the C320 the C230 before making a buying decision (the cost difference is quite significant) and found that the performance that the C230 offers pales in comparison to the C320.  The C320 drives like a bolt of thunder (when necessary) but purrs like a kitten with a super quiet engine. The acceleration is quite fast and very steady.

I really don't like driving at all - in any car ... but I honestly can say that since purchasing my Mercedes C320 I've come to enjoy driving a lot more.

The following options I bought are great: 
Navigation Command System
Voice Control
Power Rear Window Sun-Shade
6-disc CD changer (mounted in glove box)
premium leather seats
Rain Sensor
Glass Sunroof
Integrated Hands-Free Timeport
Fold-Down Rear Seat

Everything is so easy to use and program!  Never would I have thought a foreign car would be so simple yet have so much!  

Now I will be honest, I would have loved to get the S-Class, but I can't afford one yet, I hear the body style of the E-Class is changing soon so I didn't bother looking into buying one (though they drive like a dream - like floating on a cloud)!

The programs Mercedes offers their customers are great too..<b>free</b> maintenance (including oil changes, tire balancing/rotation, tune-ups) and loaner vehicles (Mercedes of course) make paying the higher price a little more comforting.
