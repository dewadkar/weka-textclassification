            I purchased a 2000 Ford Focus in Tucson, AZ in October of 1999....I think I was the first one the dealership sold.

It has proved, beyond a shadow of a doubt , to be the most worthy investment, I have ever made.

I was able to do everything online to purchase my vehicle...including my credit application, approval, car specifications, everything.

All i did when i went to the dealership was show them my printouts, and I was test driving my car in 20 minutes....2 hours later I was in the financing office, signing my final papers.

The car had every feature I looked for. And well worth the money.

If you have thought of checking one out, test drive one, and it will prove to be what you want...believe me.


I am 6'3&quot;, and it is hard to find a car in which i can comfortably sit...and plenty of room...it can seat 5 comfortably.

I recommend this to a single person, as well as a family.
