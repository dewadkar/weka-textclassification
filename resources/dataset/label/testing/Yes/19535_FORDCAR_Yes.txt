            My childhood dream, a Ford Mustang GT with a big beefy AMERICAN bred V-8. I had the highest expectations for this car, as a child and as an adult, and can honestly say they have all been pleasentlly met and mostly exceeded. This car is an absolute driving experience! The Mustang hugs every corner, handles like a race car, accelerates like a runaway roller-coaster on a downhill slope, and stops on a dime. This is Ford's ultimate American muscle car worthy of the mear 25,600 sticker M.S.R.P. The Ford Mustang isn't just a sports car, it's an image. Start the engine up, stomp on the gas, crank the Stepenwolf "Born to be wild" on the Mach 460 sound system, and explore America. I love this car, and I can't say it enough. The Ford Mustang is a winner in my book and is sure to be one in yours.
