I love SUVs, sports cars, and I want a car that can get me around with little fuss.  Somehow the Subaru Legacy has combined the steadiness of a Taurus, the peppiness and handling of a BMW, and the terrain fearlessness of a Range Rover.  Of course, combining all these things result in something in the middle, but in the Legacy it works.  When it rains, snows, or I have to drive on dirt, my car's All Wheel Drive safely leaves all those other cars behind.  When some jerk wants to race me at the stoplight, I can usually beat them with great acceleration, and sporty shifting with my standard transmission.  And when I want something that will carry five friends, move a bookshelf to a new apartment, and not have cranky maintenance needs, the Legacy delivers.  Buy this car, and you'll never have any problems, while now and then you get to do cool stuff other cars can't even think of doing.
