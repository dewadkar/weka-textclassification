            A little over a year ago, I gave birth to our third child...and we promptly filled our little Chevy Corsica!  We started looking at minivans, much to my husband's chagrin!  We looked at several models, they all had different features that we liked, but when it came down to it, we chose the Mercury Villager for several reasons.

After being used to driving a smaller car for so long, the thought of driving a minivan had me a little nervous.  And as I have the kids most of the time, this was to be the car I drove most often.  But when I test drove the Mercury Villager, I found that it handled very easily!  The turn radius on it was comparable to a much smaller car...it might even be better than the turn radius of our Corsica!  

With three children, the seating arrangements and comfort was also of concern when we were looking at minivans.  The bench seats in the Villager are extremely comfortable and we found that we could easily fit our carseats into them.  Our baby's seat reclines more than a booster seat, and the seat back in the Villager adjusted to allow for that and for a tight and safe fit.  Also, his seat has a tether option with it and for a reasonable price, we can get installed in the Villager the hardware needed to use it.

For the driver, there are several comfort and safety features that I liked.  The seat has electronic adjustment which I have come to really enjoy as my husband and I have a height difference of almost a foot between us.  It also has a lumbar support that can be adjusted for comfort when driving a lot.  Our Villager, a 1997 version, also has cruise control which I have found to come in handy and is extremely easy to use.  The automatic side view mirror adjustment is simple and located in an area where it is easy to find.  

The climate controls in the Villager can be controlled solely by the driver or can be transferred to the back part of the van where passengers can adjust them to their own preferences.  With kids, I have found it safer to just keep control of these up front with me!

I have to say, though, that my favorite aspect of this minivan, and one I show off most often, is the fact that the back window can open separately from the back gate.  This has come in SO handy when I come home from the grocery store with the ample back storage area filled with groceries.  I don't have to open the back gate at all and risk things shifting and falling out.  I can merely open the window and reach in to get my groceries out.

There are a few things that we didn't like as well about the Villager as other minivans we looked at.  One was that the drink holders weren't adjustable and my husband's large drink cups didn't fit well in them.  But we found these things to be minor when looking at the big picture and have been able to make adjustments to take care of these things!

Overall, I have found my 1997 Mercury Villager to be a very comfortable, and convenient vehicle for us.  I feel that it was a good investment and a great decision for my family!<br><br>
