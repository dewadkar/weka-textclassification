            I purchased my 1996 Land Rover Discovery new in Oct 1996. It was easily the best car buying experience I have ever had. The dealership treated me Very well. The truck was delivered in perfect condition, now nicks, scrapes, very clean, etc. The vehicle itself was very reliable over-all. I did have several problems with the electrical system however. The SRS light and the Check Engine light would each come on when they shouldn't have. It took about 8 trips to service before the problems were resolved. While this was a bit of a hassle, the service dept was Excellent. My truck came back washed and detailed every time. They were very fast and did whatever was needed to fix the problem each time.

The driving experience was the best part. If you want a truly capable off road vehicle, and also a great on road vehicle, this is an excellent choice. It is truly a pleasure to drive every where. The dealership has off road events every few months to let you enjoy all of the trucks capabilities.

The major downside to the truck is the resale value. I recently traded it in for something bigger, and I was very disappointed in the trade-in allowance.<br><br>
