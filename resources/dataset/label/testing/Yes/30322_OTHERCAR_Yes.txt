            I bought my van in `94 used, it had 32000 miles on. It looked new and still had some warranty left.It`s a Grand
Voyager SE, with most of the standard options. Two very important options I don`t have, "I highly recommend them to anyone buying a minivan" #1. Rear heat and air conditioning.
If I ever wear this van out and buy another one, that will be the first thing I will look for.#2 Power back flip out windows. I have to get out and close them when it`s raining.
I have the 3.3 V6 with 4 speed auto/overdrive. It has plenty of power and I still get around 25 mpgs 0n the highway. I pull a small utility trailer and boat trailer.
All though it`s not rated for pulling heavy load because of the frontwheel drive. It pulls just fine. I have 130,000 miles on it now. I use it every weekend to travel to the lake. Family and two dogs very comfy. I`m on my third set of tires, second set of brakes, I finally had to replace the muffler and tailpipe this year. I also had to replace the transmission this year, but I think that was my fault
because I never it serviced or had the fluid changed.
I learned a very expensive lesson.
So if it ever really breakes I`ll surly buy another Chrysler
van. (With rear heat and air)
