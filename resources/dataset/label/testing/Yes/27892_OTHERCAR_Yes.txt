            Suzuki Esteem has been a popular mid size car in the Indian market. The car has established an excellent reputation during the past few years. It gives good mileage, is spacious and aesthetically appealing. The manufacturer has a wide service network and the vehicle has proved its mettle in the tough Indian conditions. I have found it easy to handle and good value for money. Even with all its favourable points, this car is now facing tough competietion from newly introduced models like Ford Ikon, Hyundai Accent and the soon to be launched GM's Corsa. My own opinion is that Suzuki Esteem will be able to hold its own against these new models due to its inherent strengths. It will be interesting to see how the market responds. <br><br>
