Cons: Pictures quality

A while back, during a family get-together, I was complaining about the fact that if I wanted to grab a few snapshots I ended up dragging my heavy Canon A-1 out. It looked like I was going to have to purchase a point and shoot to take care of those spur of the moment shots. Evidently it caused my parent's to think as I was given a FD-73 for my birthday.

My parents have a FD-95, so I was somewhat familiar with digital photography. I enjoyed playing with their toy and was impressed with the ease of use and relative quality of the pictures. However, after a lifetime of film photography, I had serious doubts about digital photography. I took a few pictures with the camera and was not that impressed with the quality of the pictures.

It was until I went to a local sci-fi convention, that I fell in love with the FD-73. The camera is considerably lighter than the Canon, and thus much less of a burden. The large view screen makes framing quick and easy. The auto-focus is pretty accurate. I was amazed by the light the small flash unit put out. In fact I had to learn to step back from my subjects so that I wouldn't overexpose the image. One concern I had was that using the flash would eat up the battery. However that fear was unfounded, as I was still able to shot a considerable amount of photo without draining it. I especially liked the fact that I could immediately see shots and delete shots I didn't like from the floppy. 

Granted, the photo quality is disappointing if you compare it with a picture shot with film. This is not suprising as the greatest picture resolution it takes is 640 x 480. However, if you are using these images for the web or as e-mail attachments the quality is good enough. With the use of a good picture editing program, you should be easily be able to get some great shots. Being a avid eBayer, I love the fact I can quickly shoot my auction item and upload the image within a minute's time. Part of the convenience of the FD-73 is the fact that it uses the ubiquitous floppy disk. To download your images to the computer, there is no need for the used of cables or expensive memory cards. I will definitely look into getting a megapixel camera once the prices go down and the technology become established. But the ease and convenience of the FD-73 makes it a good camera for now.

So the good news. The camera is relatively inexpensive, light, easy to use, has a good battery life, and uses the easily available floppy disks. The bad news, the image quality is disappointing if you're used to film. However, if you are a weekend photographer getting a few family snaps or shooting a few shots to put on the web or in e-mails, then this camera will fit your needs.<br><br>
