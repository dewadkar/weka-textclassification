            The Honda Civic is a perfect car for anyone. The Civic is very reliable. It lives up to Honda's Legacy of performance and reliability. It is a safety harness on wheel. The Civic comes with an abundance of safety features. It has a great powerplant thats easy on gas and hard on the road. It handles like an Acura and has a shor braking distance. It has a nice smooth ride with almost no interior noise. It comes with manual and automatic tranmission. The manual gives a great amount of horsepower to the car and the transition of gears is smooth. The interior is pleasent to the eye and every thing is easily accessable to the driver. The seats are comfy and ergonomics is good. They really thought of the pasengers when designing the Civic. It has lots of interior space. Enough headroom and legroom for tall people in the front. The audio system is great and the speaker arangements make it almost feel like a music hall. The exterior styling is superb, The hard angles and smooth curves make it perfect for anybody. It isn't intimidated when it is parked next to an Acura at your local Wal-Mart parking lot.  It has a great feel and is fun to drive. It is great for anyone, and is a very practical car; and it's AFFORDABLE!! <br><br>
