            I purchased this car new in 2000 and was looking for a roomy dependable family car that I could keep for a long time.  Recently reaching the 50K mark I can honestly say that the car has been very enjoyable to own and absolutely trouble free.  It has only been to the dealer one time for its 25,000 mile check-up which was uneventful.   The only maintenance expense has been periodic oil changes and tire rotation.  The stock Michelin tires still have about 10k miles of tread left.

On long trips our fully loaded Avalon has consistently averaged an impressive 28 mpg and has adequate acceleration and impressive passing power at highway speeds.  The ride quality is fantastic and you can barely hear the engine when cruising at 75 mph.  The interior has held up better than expected and our leather seats still look brand new. Climate control works great at any temperature and the &#147Dual Mode&#148 option does a good job regulating different temperatures between the passenger and drivers seats.  The JBL  6 disk CD player delivers a premium class sound.  Up-front roominess is excellent and the back seat is the most spacious I have seen.  

As far as the negatives, I feel that the breaks could be slightly improved to add a stronger/confident feel.   Another issue I have is that for a car of this size, the tires should be slightly larger which would greatly improve cornering at higher speeds.  (Toyota may have addressed the tires issue on their 2003 model)

Overall I have been extremely satisfied with my Avalon and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a spacious, comfortable and reliable family car.  I am not big fan of the mini-van and feel that this car has given us all of the advantages of a mini-van without the soccer mom image.  
In the performance area, it is not a BMW, but for realistic driving demands the Avalon is one of the better values available.
