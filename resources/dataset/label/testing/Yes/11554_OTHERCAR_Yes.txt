            I used to drive a VW Jetta (a really fast one - GLI 16V) and loved it. I never would have imagined myself in anything else, as the commercial say, I'm a &quot;driver&quot;.

Well, along comes baby, with the ungodly amounts of &quot;stuff&quot; you need to have with you when leaving the house, and you start thinking maybe you need something *bigger*. One day I bought baby a new carseat (extra big and fancy) and realized when it was installed that I could not longer see out of the back of the car. I bought a Jeep the next day.

Chili Pepper Red Sport, 4 Door, 4 WD, lighting package, cool wheels, 10 disc changer... It's so cool.

My only hesitation with buying this vehicle was that the lack of fahrvegnugen. While it's definately no VW, it's got more spunk that I ever would have imagined. It's downright peppy.

I have lots of room for all the baby accouterment and the ability to go off-road whenever necessary - what more could you possibly want?

Well, to answer my own question.... more room. Now that there's 2 babies to cart around, I'm happy to say my next review will be of the Grand Cherokee.<br><br>
