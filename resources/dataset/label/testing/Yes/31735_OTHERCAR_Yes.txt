            I recently purchased a 2000 Dodge Intrepid. A couple of years ago, I drove an Intrepid while on vacation. I was so impressed, I decided that if I ever left the SUV/Truck market, an Intrepid was the car I would buy. Dodge has changed the body style, and most everything else in the years since I first drove an Intrepid. Still, after looking at many competetive vehicles by Ford, GM,Toyota, and Nissan, the only other vehicle I considered was the Chrysler Concorde version of the Intrepid.

What I got was a very solid built vehicle, with more interior room than any of the competition. I bought the ES model, fully loaded, for right @ $26k, out the door. It is equipped with 3.2 liter V6, leather interior, and all the bells and whistles. Trip computer, built in garage door openers, indash cd changer, 9 speaker stereo system with a 240 watt amplifier, and more.

There are only three things I wish Dodge would incorporate in the future models, they are:

1. Auto sensing headlights, that come on in low light, and go off in bright light.
2. Radio and stereo controls in the steering wheel. This is a safty feature my last vehicle had, and I believe in it so strongly, I believe the Federal Government should make it mandatory.
3. I find that the drivers side mirror leaves a large blind spot, that really requires the driver to look too far back over the left shoulder to make a lane change to the left.

Over all I am impressed with the car.<br><br>
