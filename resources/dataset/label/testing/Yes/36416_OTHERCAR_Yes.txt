            We are now enjoying our third Chrysler Corp. van.  Our current one is the Chrysler Town &amp; Country all wheel drive.  My wife, the principal driver, has enjoyed every mile.  With 5th grade twins, the activities she is able to use the vehicle for are endless.  Living in &quot;snow country&quot; we appreciate the dependable and safe all wheel drive.  We have had nothing but praise for the way we are able to travel through deep snow and often icy roads.  Handling is excellent in all driving conditions.  It is extremely quite even at highway speeds. There is more than ample room for the family and friends, to say nothing of the flexibility of folding down seats or removing them altogether when necessary. The options and appointments are second to none.  The sound quality of the speakers in excellent, the air conditioning with dual climate control is a nice advantage, and oh how we love the electric heaters in the fron seats on these cold winter days.  Gas milegae is quite acceptable considering the weight, and all wheel drive of this car.  This is luxury in a family auto.  Heaters for exterior mirrors, security alarms, remote door locks, compass, outside temp reporting, distance to empty,average mpg etc. are all in themselves small items, but put all together, and we truly feel spoiled.  We would highly recommend that any person who wants to be spoiled by a fine auto, investigate this car.
