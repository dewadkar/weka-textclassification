            I purchased my 1990 Integra GS hatchback about a month ago. It had 107k miles on it, and it was in good condition. I paid $3k and I consider that to be a great price for what I got. The GS model is loaded - power everything (including sunroof) and alloy wheels.

I can tell you that these cars have wonderful reputations, and because of that they sell very fast. In fact, I went through at least 10 ads for 2nd generation Integras (all Integras made from '90-93 are 2nd generation) before I found one that hadn't yet been sold. Honda/Acura engineering means you're going to get a very well made car that will last a very long time if properly maintained. The engine will be the last thing to go on this car, and there are many on the road with upwards of 200k+ miles.

For a sporty car, the interior is very open and airy, with a high roof for tall people. Lots of glass means great visibilty and virtually no blind spots. The back seat is cramped, and not recommended for adults on long trips. However, the hatchback has tremendous trunk space, especially when you flip down the 60/40 split seats. 

Those who really love to drive should go right for a 5-speed. Shift action is slick, and the engine is very responsive - especially in higher RPMs (this is a 16v twin cam 130hp motor). Even for an 11 year old car, my motor pulls smoothly in all rev ranges, and is pretty quiet. Handling is also very very good - even on the stock 14" rims. However, if you live in a city with bad, rough roads as I do (NYC) prepare for a rough ride. The same suspension that makes the car a pleasure to drive on decent or twisty roads makes for a jarring experience over bad pavement.

You should also know that this is one of the most loved older generation cars on the road. Many are bought to be modified, restored, etc. In fact, go to www.g2ic.com for a fantastic Web site dedicated specifically to 2nd generation Integras. You'll find buying advice, technical advice, etc.

I budgeted for a $3000k used car that I could just tool around in and use to escape NYC on nice days. What I got for the money was SO much more than just an average old car. I know this car is going to be around for a while yet!
