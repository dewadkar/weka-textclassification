            I own a 94 Toyota &quot;Tacoma&quot; that was called simply an &quot;extended-cab 4WD pickup&quot; when I bought it. The model I own is 4-Cylinder (20RE engine) with standard 5-speed transmission and minimal options. Overall, I've been very happy with this truck, but I wouldn't recommend it to most of my friends, and I would discourage anyone from buying one as a primary car or as a &quot;toy.&quot;

- Power. First and foremost, the 4-cylinder engine is virtually the same as the 20R engine installed in the 76 Toyota Chinook that preceded this truck, and exploded all over the Hollywood Freeway after 180,000 miles. The RE has de riguer electronic enhancements and fuel injection. It's a solid, reliable engine, but the Toyota pickup is a heavy vehicle and the four-banger engine is too gutless for many real truck jobs. I'd recommend this motor if you're going to be doing lots of level highway miles with light loads and mileage is your top priority, but using a light truck the way I do -  pulling boats through Baja (a 17' Boston Whaler/90 HP motor), cramming the camper shell to the ceiling  and beyond with windsurfing and camping gear, stuffing it to the gills with whitewater rafts, coolers and kayaks on the way to the Grand Canyon, motoring up Donner Pass for a weekend ski trips, and hauling loads of horse manure to plant in the backyard, all reveal the sad truth about this truck. It's too big, heavy and sluggish to be a decent car, and it's too wimpy to be a good truck.

- Mileage. That said, this truck gets barely decent twenty-something mileage on the highway, unlike the V-6, which is rated at about 15. Having driven a friend's V-6, however, I can say that that version feels a lot more powered up like a truck should. The irony, of course, is that my friend never leaves the highway and the only load he schleps is his snowboard and his overweight dog. Same is pretty much true of the other friends I have who drive the V6 version. Consider the planet before choosing.

- Reliability and costs. The truck's been plenty reliable in 88,000 miles, although there have been a few fairly major repairs. After 40,000 miles towing boats and negotiating San Francisco hills, I had to replace the clutch. On the other hand, I've had to replace the clutch in every car I've ever driven in San Francisco. Some computerized fuel regulator gizmo broke after about 60,000 miles and set me back a few hundred dollars. But those, a few sets of tires, and an oil change every 3,000 miles, have been pretty much the whole story. The truck costs a lot to insure because of the 4WD and it also burns more gas than a similar 2WD truck.

- Finish durability. Driving for several winters on Central Oregon mountain roads, the cinders the highway department puts down for ice have eaten through the paint behind the rear wheels. These spots have rusted pretty badly, but overall, the underbody is clean and the truck's finish has held up fine. The interior upholstery is OK where it's cloth covered. But the vinyl covered seat head rests cracked and began falling apart after the first year. The interior can best be described as &quot;plastic.&quot;

- Comfort and handling. This truck handles like a, well, truck. Its springs are actually too mushy for hauling big loads or pulling a heavy boat, meaning it rides very low in the back during these maneuvers, but unloaded, it's a tough, uncomfortable, bouncy ride. The truck handles well, for a truck, which isn't saying much. It's slow to accelerate and stop, and it feels like it want's to roll over if you go fast around a corner, which it will. The front seats are roomy and comfortable, but the back seat is a bad joke. We actually strap our baby's seat into the front (it doesn't fit in the back) and my wife or I take turns crammed in the back seat while the other drives. It's a stupid way for a family of three to travel, but don't even entertain the though of spending three hours in this truck with four adults. You'll simply have to ro-sham-bo to see who walks.

- Overall, I really like my truck. But it's a bad family car, a bad all-purpose car, a bad commuting car, a bad driving experience, and a terrible car to park. If you're looking for a car, don't buy this truck. So why do I like it? I need a truck, and this one works reliably, which is all I ask of any appliance.
