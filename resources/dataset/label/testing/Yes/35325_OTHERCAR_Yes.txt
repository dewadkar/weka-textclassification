            I came from a Jeep Wrangler to this truck so there will be no complaining about roominess in this review.  Plenty of room in the front, more than enough in the back, and the bed is great for me, the occasional bed-user (especially with the bed extender, works great!)

We drove a Civic and Wrangler, and were tired of always using others' vehicles for hauling and taking more than 2 people around town or up to Tahoe.  A 4 door truck was the perfect choice.

I tried the Frontier first, and felt the back seat was too small, and the shifter was way too tall.  A non-exciting truck.

Then the Dakota...this is and was my first choice.  Bit got the 4wd look I like, I was looking at $30K.  Couldn't do it.  But I like the midsize size and V8 availability.  And the looks and room.

The SportTrak is just plain terrible, and the Chevy is completely ugly.  

I hadn't considered the Toyota, figuring the rear seat was about as big as the Nissan.  Then I read about the PreRunner.  A 2wd in a 4wd body.  Perfect!  Good mileage and the stance I like.  And with the TRD it comes with a rear locker, so I have 2 drive wheels if ever needed.

Now I won't be doing the intense off road driving as I did with the Jeep, but for camping and occasional 4 wheeling this will be just right.  

The V6 is very nice, 191 HP.  Lots of power on demand, and the automatic is a great match for it.  I have to say the tranny has way too much hesitation in it.  I can feel it regularly.  It is not an issue, but compared to my Fiancee's smoother than silk Volvo S40, it gets noticed.

The layout is basic Toyota.  Gets the job done without fireworks.  The clock is in a bad place, but oh well.  THe passenger grab handle should be above the door.  The seats are really not comfortable.  Like sitting on plywood.  I commute 40 miles each way and after 6 months am in the market for some seats.  I also would like a battery and oil gauge.

The truck handles very well, quite responsive.  The dealer always fills the tires to 40, making it veyr rough, but the door sticker says 28, so I lower them to 30 and its a nice ride.  Still a truck, but a nice one.

The truck looks very nice.  Tough, and I get lots of compliments for the deep green color.  The 265 tires and 16" wheels are a great addition.  I really like those wheels.  And BFG tires are tops.  Good move Toyota.

The bed is plenty for me.  The cargo extender is great for camping and other times you need more room, and good for containing groceries or plants when closed.  The rear seats fold down flat for a nice surface for storage.  There is room behind the seat for lot sof flat things, cables, tie downs, tire iron, etc, but I would like to add a subwoofer and I think it will have to go under the front seats.  

I get 19-21 MPG in this truck.

Overall, this is a great truck.  Hope you have a well-padded tushee though.
