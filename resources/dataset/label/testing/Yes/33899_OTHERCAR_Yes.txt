            <b>The Specs</b>
If you're looking to buy an SUV and have been doing some research (like you should be), then you probably have read all the technical specs for the Forester from Subaru or some other source, so I'll keep this section short.

<i>Valvetrain</i>-Horizontally opposed 4-cylinder with die cast aluminum-alloy block and aluminum-alloy cylinder heads.

<i>Fuel System</i>-16-valve with single overhead camshaft design (SOHC).

<i>Ignition System</i>-Sequential multi-port fuel injection system.

<i>Electric system</i>-Low-maintenance distributorless electronic.

<i>Engine management</i>-ECM Engine Control Module manages fuel injection and ignition systems and features learning, self-diagnosis, limp-home and anti-knock capabilities.

<i>Body Construction Management</i>-Unitized with hydroformed front sub-frame, front and rear crumple zones and aluminum-alloy hood. 72% of body sheet metal is two-sided galvanized.

<i>Suspension</i>-Fully independent, heavy-duty raised type with coil springs and struts. Front: Lower L-arms with liquid-filled rear brushings and stabilizer bar. Rear: Parallel links and stabilizer bar.

<i>Brakes</i>-Power-assisted with dual diagonal hydraulic circuits and 4-channel/4-sensor anti-lock braking system (ABS). Front: 11.4-inch ventilated discs with twin-piston calipers. Rear: 9.0-inch drums. 

<i>All Wheel Drive</i>-Full-time AWD system automatically distributes power between front and rear wheels based on traction needs: Manual transmission models have a viscous-coupling locking center differential. Automatic transmission models have an electronically managed continuously variable transfer clutch. 2.5 XS models have a viscous limited-slip rear differential. 

<b>Pre 1,000mi</b>

I purchased my 2003 Forester a little over a month now, and it has been great! Granted I haven't had it that long, but it's quiet, comfortable, handles great, and the A/C is cold! I purchased the X model because it had all the features I needed (Front/Side Air Bags, ABS, AWD, A/C, Power Steering/Window/Doors, CD Player), except for the automatic transmission, so that was the ONLY option I added. The X model comes with steel wheels, which I must say look good for steel. I thought it was alloy until I got a good look at it. When I picked up the Forrester, it had 20 miles, now it has 850 miles. So far there are no problems whatsoever. 

The interior is comfortable and roomy. The radio buttons are big and easily accessible. The climate controls are under the radio and a storage compartment. The climate controls are located a little too low, any adjustments require you to look down (toward the shifter), then make your adjustments. If it were switched with the storage compartment, you wouldn't have too look as far down. Front seats are comfortable as well as leg room. Adults can fit in the rear seats comfortably (as long as the front seats are not adjusted all the way back), but it seems like they are more suited for children. Rear seats are split 60/40 and fold down easily to accomodate large cargo.

Then engine is quiet and runs well. The transmission is a little sluggish to downshift, but it's not that big of a deal. Power is decent from the 4 cylinder engine (I need to go up 2 miles of hill to get home everyday), even with the A/C on. So far I have been getting about 24 mpg...Subaru estimates 22-26 mpg. Road noise is somewhat loud, but quieter than my previous cars (Toyota MR2, Chevy Lumina Sedan), but keep in mind that the roads here in Hawaii need to be re-paved. I am looking forward to many years of joy with this SUV. I will be updating my experiences with my Forester every few thousand miles.

<b>5/5/03 Update</b>
My Forester is at 1600 miles now, so far everything is working as it should. 8) Used the valet key last night, that was great, it gave me peace of mind knowing that the glove compartment couldn't be opened with that key.

I do have one little gripe as of now though. I wish Subaru used plastic/vinyl on the armrests, the armrests are cloth. I can imagine that cloth armrests will get dirty over time with body oil and/or dirt. Cloth is also hard to clean when compared to vinyl/plastic. I applied scotchguard on all the armrest to help keep them cleaner a little longer, hopefully it works.

<b>6/28/03 Update </b>
Just completed my first oil change, which was a snap. Ran down to the auto parts store, picked up the oil, filter, "cup" style oil filter wrench, and the drain plug gasket.  For the first time, I crawled under the Forester to take a look and what would be involved. Subaru decided to "hide" the oil drain plug and filter behind a plastic cover, which is easily removed by 6 plastic screws. Once the screws are removed, the cover rotates to the side to give you access to the oil drain plug and filter. I've never seen a cover like this before, but I guess it's a good way to help keep that area a little cleaner. Both the drain plug and filter was a snap to remove and replace, within 15 minutes I was done. I really liked the fact that I don't need to jack up the car to change oil, this makes life a little easier.
