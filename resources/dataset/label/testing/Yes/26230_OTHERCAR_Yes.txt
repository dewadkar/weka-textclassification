            We just bought a dark green 2001 BMW X5 with the 3.0 liter 6 cylinder engine. What a great car! We've owned a Land Cruiser, a Range Rover, a Jeep Cherokee and a Jeep Grand Cherokee. This one tops them all. It has great power, it's quiet (with that BMW growl in the exhaust). It's the best SUV we've ever owned. The cornering is great and so is the stereo. The only thing that's a draw back is the size of the rear cargo container. Fit and finish are perfect. We'd recommend not buying the 4.4 liter V8. It is $8,000 more. Instead go for the 3.0 liter six cylinder and get the sport package. Beware the sport package on the V8 if you're going to do winter driving. The tires are not made for winter. On the six cylinder with the sport package the tires are the standard all season tires so they're fine for winter.
