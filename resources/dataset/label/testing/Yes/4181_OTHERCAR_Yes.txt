            When I was pregnant with my third child, my husband and I realized we couldn't cut it with our small Subaru station wagon.  Besides a new baby, our older kids were getting bigger and needed to be transported (along with friends) to and from various activities.  What more perfect vehicle to buy than a Dodge Grand Caravan?  Any growing family should buy this vehicle.  This mini-van is not suitable for single, young urban types, unless they need to haul lots of people and things!

We looked at other mini-vans and we kept going back to the Dodge product because we really like the features - especially the driver's side sliding door which gives you access to the rear passenger area on BOTH sides of the van.  We also were happy to see that in the model we chose, child car safety seats were built in to the middle bench seat!  This came in quite handy for us.  The Grand Caravan comes equipped with lots of storage space for the kids to stash away their toys and anything they wish to bring along for the ride.  Cup holders, tinted glass, and ample storage space in the rear also made the Grand Caravan a better choice for us.

When I drove the Grand Caravan for the first time I was AMAZED at how well it handles.  Now, I had been used to handling a small compact station wagon and I was a bit reluctant to take on a larger vehicle. But it was just like driving a car - but better. The added height makes the driver's view so much better - you can see so much more of the road ahead of you!  It drives smoothly and handles the bumps quite well.  The only thing that I did not like was that the ride is somewhat more &quot;noisy&quot; than in a regular car.  But by turning my radio up, I remedy that!<br><br>
