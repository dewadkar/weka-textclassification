            I bought the limited edition in taupe color. I am very happy with the car.Like everyone else states, it is slower when pulling out into traffic, but so what?? Just build in extra time when you pull out into a busy street. On the highway it handle like any other mid-size car. Personally, I thing the speed factor only appeals to drivers under 30 anyway, for the rest of us...Enjoy the ride. The leather suede seats are very comfortable (much better than my wife's Accord, but don't tell her I said so-Thanks.) The car has all the extras you usually find high priced cars: Heated seats,Mirror Defroster, Traction Control, Moonroof, Nice Chrome wheels etc. 
 I was looking at buying either a Infinity Q30, Chrysler 300, Maxima or a Acura, but those cars are all the same. I wanted freedom from the drone of business cars in the parking lot! I am so happy I got the PT Crusier. I know this is corny, but I feel free when I drive it. 
 My kids love the car, my wife just laughs at me when I mention that I love the car...My older sister, who remembers my fathers old cars says its like riding in Dads old car! 
Its not for everyone though...My sister also commented that it reminds her of a 1940s milk truck, and asked me if I was done with my route!!! Well, what is family for if they can rib you a little.....regardless...I love my PT Cruiser.

On small issue....Chrylsler should just include the drawer under the passenger seat...it doesn't cost much and its a hassle to order it and go down to the dealer and pick it up, when it should be included in the first place...well got to go....Main Street needs their morning milk!!!!
