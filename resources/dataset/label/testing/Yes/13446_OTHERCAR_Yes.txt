            I have had my Blazer for about three years. I have to admit when I bought it I was a little conserned because of the high mileage. It has proved me wrong and has preformed very well. In the time i have had it I have put over 65,000 miles on it and it has cost  me only the standard maintaince and tires. I have driven all over the USA and it preformed well in all conditions,from snow storms in the Mts.. to hot weather in the deserets. I have driven up to 400 miles at a time with very little fitigue. It is a vehicle with 200,000 miles on it and still preforms very well. I would recomend it to anybody who loves driving.<br><br>
