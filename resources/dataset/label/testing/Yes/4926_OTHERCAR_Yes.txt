            <b>I never thought I could justify spending $30,000 on a pickup...</b>

<b>BUT</b>...I would have been OK if I had declined the offer to test drive one. I test drove a 2003 Toyota Tundra SR5 4X4 with the 4.7 liter i-Force V-8 and that was the worst thing I did... because I bought it. What impressed me so?

Well, I purposely left the Tundra for last, since I knew that I would be biased toward them for the simple reason that I've always been a Toyota fan. Don't get me wrong, I like American built cars/trucks too, it's just that I've always had a desire for a 4X4 Toyota since I was in high school. Silly...yes, I know. But that's life.  

<b>My Criteria</b>

I was desiring a full-size truck that could carry 6 passengers in relative comfort WITHOUT requiring the behemoth size of the current crew cab offerings. So this limited my selection to Extended/Super/Quad/Acces cabs, some with 3 doors, 4 doors, and one without any extra.

Most importantly it had to cost LESS than $30,000 with all the options I desired. These would include, Air conditioning, 4 wheel drive, CD/Cassette player, easy rear cab access (meaning access doors), six-foot minimum length bed, a V-8 engine getting better than 15 MPG on the highway, bedliner, cruise control, and larger 265/70X16 tires/wheels.

This limited my selection to 4 vehicles. All 2003 models, a Ford F150, a Chevy K1500, and a Dodge Quad cab. 

<b>The Competition</b>

I drove the Dodge first, since the dealer is just up the road from my house. I was impressed with the exterior looks, the price was in the mid to upper 20's, and it seemed to be a good contender. The test drive revealed a few surprising flaws. First, the unit I drove had a very rough shifting transmission. It shifted so roughly, that the pot-belly of the salesman would "lurch" in such a way when it shifted that I almost couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud. Secondly, it seemed to have trouble coming out of 4 wheel drive. I was never sure if we were back in 2WD mode or not the entire test drive. I said "Thanks" and drove off straight to the Ford dealer up the road.

I have to admit that the F150 is a real looker, especially when equipped with the nice alloy wheels. The interior layout was a little more "thoughtful" in my opinion than the Dodge, and the tranny was silky smooth, complete with a positive switching 4WD mode. The gas mileage was just at 15 MPG on the highway and once I found a model with all the options I wanted, I was at $32500. I spent a lot more time here looking at everything over an over. I just wasn't seeing or feeling anything that was compelling me to spend $32500 on the Ford. 

The next day on the way home from work, I stopped in at the Chevrolet dealer and drove an extended cab Silverado 1500 4X4 with the Vortec 5.7 liter V8. The MPG was even worse than the Ford but overall I felt the truck was better built and better equipped. I didn't care for the fact that this truck was so computer dependant for everything from the A/C temperature control to the little antenna on the roof of the cab that could "talk" with the satellites. The price was on par with the Ford once I added my goodies. Again, I wasn't ready to part with my hard-earned cash. 

One thing to point out is that all of the "Big 3" trucks that I drove WOULD NOT fit inside my garage with the door closed. Although this fact alone was not a deal buster, it was a factor.

<b>The ride that stole my heart.</b>

When I finally drove up to the Toyota dealer a week later (call it a cooling off period), I was looking for the plainest-Janest-lookin Tundra with 4X4 and a V8 figuring that I would focus more on the more important things like ride quality and such.  Even with this, I was nearly in shock with the smoothness of the ride. I DID NOT feel like I was in a truck except for the size and the height. The Toyota V8 seemed to be itching to "roar" and sounded more "racey" than any of the other offerings. After the rather lengthy test drive, I knew that this was the truck.

I got out and started looking for THE truck I wanted to actually buy.  I chose a white sportside without leather seats (I always cover my seats with waterproof covers anyway) and have never looked back. I got a decent deal at $500 over invoice and I am HAPPY!

This truck is such a joy to drive. Every little thing is so well thought out and I've been consistently getting 16   MPG even on a new engine.  I've been told it will get a little better once the engine breaks in.

If you're considering a new truck and don't need/want a crewcab or a diesel, do yourself a favor, drive the others and save the Toyota for last. You'll know what I mean when you drive the Tundra.

Check back in a couple months for a short-term update.

OH, what a feeling! Damn, I love this Toyota.
