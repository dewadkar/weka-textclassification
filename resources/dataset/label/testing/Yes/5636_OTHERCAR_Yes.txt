            I made a tough decision back in February.  I had to decide between buying a new Chevy Camaro Z28 or the new Pontiac Vibe GT.  For years I have always wanted the Camaro.  I loved the throaty V8 sound, power, and looks.  But the Camaro was an old design, not practical, and is so expensive for a 20 year old male to insure.  The Vibe GT on the other hand has a high output 180 hp 4 cylinder, with a nice exhaust note, not deep, but a nice racing sound to it.  The Vibe is a 2003, brand new design, better quality, and so much more practical, and it's cheaper in both price and insurance.  

I decided to order my Shadow colored Vibe GT back in February and finally took delivery on May 8th.  I love this car.  I'm breaking in the engine and haven't gone above 5000 rpm yet, but it still has pretty good pick up.  I'll update this once I try out the higher RPMs.  The engine revs very easily.  At 6200 rpm up to 8200 rpm the second lobe kicks in (VVTL-i), and many reviewers say it feels like a turbo kicking in.  I can't wait to try that out.  I don't really like the gray plastic cladding most Vibes have, but I bought the option to have it painted.  So, with that option I got all the cladding painted, bumpers, and door handles painted.  

I like the style of the Vibe.  I think it looks better in person, than a lot of the pictures I have seen.  The Matrix I think is too plain, and looks like a mini van in some ways, similar to the previous generation Honda Odyssey, just smaller.  

I bought the premium sound system and sunroof package.  This included component speakers up front, so you have tweeters near the side view mirrors and on the lower door.  This gives much better imaging, and sounds very good for a factory system.  The other two speakers are in the lower part of the rear doors.  I also got the 6 cd in dash cd changer.  This is nice, especially on longer trips.  Other neat features are the outside temp display, AC outlet, and a pollen air filtration system (all standard).  The glove box is large, there is a cabinet under the shifter, and a small container for sunglasses or whatever in the dash to the left of the wheel.  On the center console there is a dual compartment armrest with a hidden DC outlet, two deep useful cupholders, and a tray for cd jewel cases.  

I and everyone who has gone for a ride with me feel the seats are very comfortable.  I think there is good cushioning, lumbar support, and side bolsters for lateral support.  Even the backseat is very comfortable.  It may be a little tight for three adults, but two is very comfortable, especially for this size of a car.  I'm 6' and there is plenty of room in both the front and back.  I can sit behind the driver seat in my seating position, and still have several inches between the seat and my knees, plus there is plenty of space for your legs to stretch under the front seats because of the higher seating positions.  There is plenty of storage, nine concealed storage areas throughout, and lots of cargo space with the rear seats both up or down flat.  One option which I also recommend is the rear cargo mat.  Your cargo will slide around on the smooth floor, but you can order the double sided cargo mat.  The mat matches the interior, has "Vibe" embroidered into it, is carpet on one side and rubber on the other.

I find the Vibe GT very fun to drive.  It handles great in the turns, with not much body lean.  The suspension is tight and smooth.  I can't wait to try the VVTL-i in the higher rpms, which will give even more power.  The six speed is nice and shifts smoothly.  
The interior fit and finish is great.  I like the interior design, it looks good and functions very well.  All the controls are in perfect reach, including the shifter.  Your hand falls easily from the wheel to the shifter.  Some people complain that it is hard to see the gages with sunglasses on.  I'm using polarized sunglasses and can see them fine, except for the odometer and temperature display.

I only have a couple of minor complaints.  The Toyota Matrix and Vibe share the exact same powertrains, but Toyota gives the 5 year 60k mile warranty, and Pontiac (GM) only gives a 3 year 36k mile warranty.  Another thing is the roof rack is a little short.  It seems the designers went for looks and not functionality.  They should have made it the full length of the roof.  I bought a kayak thinking I could put it up there, even Pontiac's Vibe brochure say's it is a fully functional rack and can be used for kayaks.  I've contacted Yakima, an aftermarket rack and rack accessory manufacturer and they don't recommend carrying kayaks.  I asked if they could try putting a cross bar piece that is usually used on cars without factory racks that clamps onto the inside of the door frames up front behind the windshield on the Vibe.  The rep said they may try that and told me to call back in a few weeks.  The last thing is one body panel on my Vibe, the front driver side fender, is not fit as well as it should be.  It's where the top corner nearest the windshield meets the hood and A pillar, the panel is up about an eighth of an inch higher than the other panels.  The passenger side matches perfectly.  You can push it down, but it won't stay.  I'll see if the dealer can do anything about it, but I don't want them to have to turn the bolts on the panels (that can really depreciate the value of the car having turned bolts).  

I love this car and would recommend it to anyone who wants a sporty, fun to drive and practical car.  I can't wait to take it camping, there is so much room inside for such a small car.
