            To set the scene, just picture a newlywed couple in their early twenties who don't have their own car and are entering the real world of life.  Luckily our Uncle Dave owned a used car dealership in Washington State.  So out we set from New Jersey all the way to Washington to get a deal on a used car.  This was about three years ago, and the Toyota Camry was The Car to have.  
 
With a budget and the absolute need for reliability, gas mileage and trying to get as much car for the buck, we looked at Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.  It was very clear that the names just jacked up the prices beyond reach, so Uncle Dave suggested the Subaru Legacy he just got in that day.
 
It had everything we could have wanted and more, so we said ok.  The deal was done, and it wasn't until we drove it back across country in the middle of winter that we realized what a gem we had.  This is a 1993 Legacy we bought with 70K miles on it and it was purring like it had just been assembled two months ago.
 
The car is now 7 years old, with 170K miles on it and we haven't had to do any type of major repair on it at all.  The mileage is still up there with about 30 mpg and just the necessary maintenance has kept it happy. 

Of course, after 170K miles there are bound to be some small maintenance requirements.  The unnecessary cosmetic fixes are the radio antenna doesn't automatically go down anymore, it just stays up, and the drain for the sunroof  needs to be cleaned out so that water doesn't pool during monsoon weather. Major maintenance needed at this time are new timing belts, checking brake pads, tire alignments, tune up and a car wash.
 
Plus it has a sunroof, and I'm such a sucker for a sunroof!<br><br>
