            I am a 43 year old woman who loves to fish and garden. I bought the 1998 Dodge Dakota Sport so I could just throw things in the back and take off! It is wonderful for doing the things that I love to do.  I can buy my gardening items, throw in my fishing rod and tackle and go anywhere that I please in my little Dodge! My friends call be a tomboy but I am really a grandma and my grandchildren just love it too!  It gets great gas mileage and is very easy to keep clean.  When the time comes for a change I will  trade for another!<br><br>
