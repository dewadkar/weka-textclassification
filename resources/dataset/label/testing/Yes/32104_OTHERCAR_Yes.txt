            I bought my new 2000 Chrysler 300M at Wright Chrysler-Plymouth in Seaford, Delaware.  They were one of the best dealers I've ever dealt with and much, much better than the 5-star rated Chrysler dealers.  They gave me a great price that included a $3,000 factory rebate, $2,000 dealer rebate, and $10,000 for my trade.  I traded a 1997 Plymouth Grand Voyager stripper-base for this car because I wanted something sporty, elegant, and FAST!!!!  So far I haven't driven it any higher than 70mph at no higher than 2500rpm.  It now has 800 miles but I still don't want to race it.  Before purchase, I test drove a white/light pearl beige 2000 300M with every option including the performance suspension and 17&quot; wheels but no sunroof.  I would have went home with the car that night, but they were rather rude people and offered me pennies for my creampuff trade.  So the next day I called around and found a really nice dealer that had 3-2000 300M's and said I would not be disappointed with their offer.  They were right and I went home with the car the next night after loan-approval.  I did like the PHP-equipped model and would have probably bought it but the dealer was not willing.  My slate car with an agate interior is beautiful and drives like a heavenly dream-the base suspension is just as excellent as the sport option but rides slightly better.  I have had no complaints thus far, just a loose trim panel near the back window but they're going to fix it soon.  I love the powerful way it accelerates, stops, and handles and have only a few minor quibbles.  When you sit and look at some of the interior trim, the car starts to seem a little cheap.  Second, the road noise and thumps are a little noisy for this type of car, but by no means ubjectionable or nearly as bad as my Voyager was.  Overall I love the car and would have bought it based on looks alone-I think the best part is the front end-contrary to many other's feelings.  Everyday I get compliments and am asked several questions about it.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a very sporty and very affordable sports sedan.<br><br>
