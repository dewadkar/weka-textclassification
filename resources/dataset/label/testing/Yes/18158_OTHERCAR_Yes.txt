            We got the A4 1.8T Avant (wagon). Right off the bat you know this is no race car. It does okay getting on the freeway and keeping up with traffic but this is a heavy car with a 4 banger turbo and if you think for one second that you're going to go zipping here and there then forget the 1.8T and get the V6.

That said; I used the Audi as my company car. I can pack all my computer stuff in the back and enjoy a good gas mileage return and I do. I am logging at least 24  miles per gallon and that's pretty good.

Here is some bad stuff; at 3275 on the odometer we are rewarded with a major oil leak. Its coming from inside the timing chain/belt area. I took it in with a really bad look on my face and they service people at Rector Audi (Burlingame CA) are taking care of it. In fact Its in there right now... Ill post later the results.

Aside from that I really like the Audi. I've had a GTI VR6 VW, Eurovan, Chevy Tahoe, Ford Ranger and Exploder, and others and I can say without hesitation the A4 Audi is a well made car. The styling is superb. The handling is very good until you push it a little in the winding hills of Boulder Creek California.

Inside the car is great. Everything is placed just right. You can tell the Audi designers had their thinking caps on. The One and only exception is the cup holders. I don't know what they were thinking when decided to put a cup holder built in to the dash right above where the radio is... you guessed it... if you have a cup of coffee even with the lid on and you hit a bump, it spills down onto the radio buttons etc... its a mess. There are two more cup holders built into the armrest that sits between the driver and passenger seats but there are very awkward to access while driving. It goes to show that the Europeans still give the placement of this American necessity a low priority. The cup holders in the back seats are built in to the fold down armrest that is built in to the seat. The cup holders pop out from end of the armrest and are just perfect.

The back wagon area has plenty of room for storage for 2 or 3 people to go on a long trip. and I really love the rear black net retainer. Its mainly intended for keeping items in the back from becoming airborne and hitting people in the back of the head. I use it as a privacy tool.

The back seat can fold down easily for storing large items. 

The glove box is huge! You can put 2 yellow pages directories in there.

Ill post more later when I get time, but rest assure, the A4 is well worth the money and my mechanic Mike over at Mechanically Speaking in Burlingame CA says these cars can go 200,000 to 300,000 without any more oil leaks...
