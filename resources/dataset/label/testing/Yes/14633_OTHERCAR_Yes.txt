            It was time for me to buy a new car and I did my homework.  I rented a Jaguar SType for a weekend, tested the new Lexus, tested the Lincoln LS, borrowed a friends E320, and spent a day in a loaded BMW 3 series. How did I end up with a Chrysler!?!  

First, styling. Distinctive on the outside without being massive.  The interior is huge, and the luxury package with wood steering wheel and dash, tilting side view mirrors in reverse and self dimming mirrors at night matched packages of other cars costing $10,000 more. Options on other cars are standard on the 300M:  heated leather seats, power driver AND passenger seats, etc.

The engine is smooth and fast. Complaints of high noise levels have seemed to all but disappear for 2002. The ride is connected, but even, and the autoshift feature is a gimmick that's actually useful in real driving situations. Fit and finish are above average, but not quite in league with the other cars I tested. The difference though, is marginal.  

A 7 year 100,000 mile power-train warranty currently offered is a big plus. I paid $1,600 below Edmunds's TMV, and got 0% financing. Unbeatable.  I've only put 1,000 miles on the car, but no squeaks,rattles or problems of any kind. This car is a no brainer. I'm surprised there aren't more on the road.
