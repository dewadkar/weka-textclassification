            in novemeber of 1995 while i was working (night shift at our local super market)  hubby stopped in and instead of my green grocery getting wagon he had traded it in on a beautiful dark blue legacy ls sedan .. i loved it from day 1 none of the i like it, i don't like it syndrome .. it was automatic , awd .. which i recomend to anyone who lives where there is much rain, snow , or mud .... see what happens is when a tires slips the others grip harder and make it much more stable ... the car has tons of room inside for both adults and children .. it is both a great couples car as well as a fantastic family car .. we now have a suv and some days i wish i still had my legacy ... :(   so if your shoppin for awd try one of these you won't regret it<br><br>
