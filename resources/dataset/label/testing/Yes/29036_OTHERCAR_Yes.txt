            In searching for an automobile to replace my existing automobile, I decided to check out the small sport-utility market, mainly because I wanted a &quot;tough&quot; vehicle that was within my price range.  And that it is coming in a little over $20,000 is quite reasonable for an SUV.  

After test driving the vehicle, I fell in love with the handling of the car.  Unlike other SUVs, it handles like a car.  The ride is very stable and the SUV comes well-equipped for its reasonable price.

In addition, the vehicle has an unusually high gas mileage for an SUV which was a predominant feature I was looking for as a result of my lengthy commute to work.  I also travel back roads so I knew I wanted a 4-wheel drive vehicle that could handle the rough terrain of the back roads I travel to work.

Color is an important feature for me in loving a car and one great thing about the CRV is that it comes in a variety of pleasing colors.  In a few months, I will trade in my car and will definitely buy the Honda CRV.<br><br>
