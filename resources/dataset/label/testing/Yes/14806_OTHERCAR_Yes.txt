            When I bought the Cougar, it was the biggest coupe around, other than Cadillac.  It had enough room for 5 to sit comfortably, and that was cool because I was always the driver for my friends.  In the first 6 months, the car was in the shop twice for problems with a noise it would make when turning.  It was a pretty loud pop, so I figured it was a big issue, but both times, the dealer checked out the steering, axle, etc and said there was no problem.  The third time I brought it into the shop it was because I got a blowout on the highway.  This seemed to fix the problem because I never heard the loud pop again, and I got 130,000 miles out of the car over 6 1/2 years.  This was alot of miles from Dayton to Philly and Wash D.C. to Philly.  

Overall, the car ran great.  The radio was really nice, the steering and handling was good, and the size of the interior for both the driver and passenger was more than adequate.  It looked stylish...more so than the current look, which I despise.  The trunk is very large also.  

One minus for the car is that the windows are very expensive, and it must be a magnet for theives to try to steal something out of it because of the small back windows.  I had to replace the little window in the back 3 different times.
