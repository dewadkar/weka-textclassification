                 Last year I bought this vehicle to replace my aging Chevy 1-ton tow truck.  For those of you who have owned and operated a tow truck, you know the severe punishment and abuse they receive.  My new 3500 has the 5.7L (350), and a 5-spd with power takeoff.  (PTO or 'power takeoff' is used to run various attachments or equipment, in this case a 'Holmes' 440 wrecker bed.) Under load, my old tow truck pulled well, but achieved only 6 to 10 mpg on the open road.  The new 3500 pulls just as well, and the 5-spd transmission brings my mileage up to around 13 to 15 mpg.  (A sizeable difference!)
     This vehicle is not only heavier than my last, but it resists any front end drift from overloading the rear.  This means that steering is still stable, even though the load behind the rear axle has increased tremendously.  A HUGE plus for safety... 
     So, if you pull a large trailer (fifth wheel), haul gravel, etc...  be assured that I have tested mine to the near limit of what can be done with these trucks.  (Reminder:  No amount of durability or size can replace using your common sense.  Overloading ANY vehicle can be a disaster.)
