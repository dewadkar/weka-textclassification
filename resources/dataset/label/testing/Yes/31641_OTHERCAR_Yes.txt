            This is not my father's Oldsmobile.  Actually, it's my Mom's.  Whenever I get back home to the east coast, I use this car to jet around town, head into Manhattan, or drive up into New England on a longer trip.  I certainly have no complaints.

I drive an SUV, and prefer the size and height of that type of car.  However, every now and again I like getting behind the wheel of this sports car-like, large, American luxury car.  The car handles very well, and has excellent pickup.  What's more, the designers must have had convenience in mind, placing all the controls easily within reach, from the stereo controls on the steering wheel, to the curved dash, allowing other adjustments to be readily made.

Another perk is the HUGE amount of trunk space, and leg room in the back seat.  I'd highly recommend this car to some of the more overpriced foreign models.<br><br>
