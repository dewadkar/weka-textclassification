            This is my first digital camera and after 3 and a half months of using it, I have decided to put my film camera away forever. The picture quality is almost like film in the &quot;Low resolution &quot; setting, and at high resolution, I defy anyone to tell the difference between film and digital. The quality is superb. I have fun printing my own images or I upload my images to a website that puts them on line, or makes prints. The camera is compact, easy to use, and fits well in your hand. My only gripes are: The battery life gets chewed up when you use the on-board viewing screen. Sometimes, the snapshots are a little dark, even in daylight. I use the software that comes with the camera, to clean up the pictures. By the way, the software that comes packaged with the camera is easy to use, and allows you to make albums. The USB cable allows for quick transfer to your computer. I really like the feature that allows you to chose what resolution you want to use. You can take half-field shots or full frame images. There is a feature that allows you to manually adjust your shots. You would expect to pay more for a 2.1 megapixel camera. This one does the job for my family, and I hope it will be around for plenty of shots to come.
