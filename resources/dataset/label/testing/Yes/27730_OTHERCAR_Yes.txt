            <b>Overview</b>

The <b>Canon Elph S100</b> is so far the smallest digital camera out on the market.  Don't let the size make you think that it isn't a good camera because it is totally the opposite.  This camera also has 2.1 Megapixels per inch making the picture have amazing quality.  Also the hookup in order to upload your digital pictures is quick and easy.  Many other options with this miniature digital camera make it desirable to the consumer.

<b>Picture Quality</b>

The Elph digital camera has 2.1 Megapixels.  Right now the highest megapixels you can get is 3.3 so trust me, 2.1 megapixels is amazing quality.  If you have a printer that can handle the quality, you won't even notice the difference between developed pictures and your printed picture.  On high setting the Elph S100 has 1600 x 1200 dpi.  Now thats a lot of dots per inch.  Most printers can only do 1200 x 1200 dpi.  So you might want to investigate what dpi your printer is first.

<b>Transferring</b>

When you upload your pictures onto your computer you won't necessarily lose any quality.  Most digital cameras you have to use the parallel port in order to connect your camera directly into the computer.  The really neat thing about this digital camera is that this is <b>parallel</b> and <b>USB</b> compatible.  If you go through the USB port your won't lose any quality and there will be a faster transfer.  Going through the parallel port ends up losing some quality and the transfer takes much longer.

Another way to upload your pictures onto your computer is to buy a flash card reader.  Since the Canon Elph S100 uses a flash card reader, you can purchase a flash card reader for $29.95.  This lets you insert your flash memory card into the reader and then it lets you upload all the pictures on the memory card into a desired folder and a desired type of file.  For instance you can choose whether or not you want a <b>JPEG</b>, <b>BMP</b>, or <b>GIF</b>.  This is what I would recommend if you don't like the hassle of removing and putting in cables into your camera.  Your cables might get all tangled.

<b>After Uploading...</b>

Once you have actually gotten your pictures onto you computer you can do many things to that picture.  You can edit the picture using the software you get.  The software included with the camera is <b>Adobe Photodeluxe</b> which is a standard program and comes with most scanners and CD-RW drives.

Inside the program you can edit, distort, add, as well as do many other things to your picture.  This is a really great program because you can crop, get rid of red-eye, and change the type of file it is.  Another reason why this Adobe is very helpful is because you can rotate a picture if you took it vertical.  The great thing about the program is, even if you have never had it before and you don't buy this camera, it only cost about $30.

<b>Overall</b>

This digital camera is one of the best out on the market.  If you have the money and you want a camera with a flash memory card, this is the camera for you.  It has great quality, easy use and great size.  Well it is kind of small but you will get use to it.  It can actually fit into the palm of your hand.  It is amazing.
