            If Honda and Toyota are known for their safety and durability records, Chrysler is not only known for the previously named features, but is also known for a sense of awe brought about by the retro appeals of their PT Cruiser.  Daimler-Chrysler designers and engineers have created a line of semi-vans/small vans that can make consumers take the extra steps.  No wonder that since the inception of this line, the company's dealers have not been able to keep up with the demand.  It's not so much that the "thing" is so powerful, "it has to do with the way it makes you feel and how fellow drivers appear envious of your fortune," said a buddy of mine from Los Angeles who had bought one for his family.  It's not the car he drives to work every morning.  Rather, it's the right car for him to go out in on Sundays and to visit his roots in the San Joaquin Valley.

A few weeks ago, on one of these drives from his home in LA, he drove right into a wall of fog on the valley floor.  That's where he almost lost his life.  In the end, he ended up having some bent fenders and scratches on the right side of the cruiser.  His joke was that in the tuile fog of the San Joaquin Valley, nobody cared about whether his car was one of the hottest cars on the road.  It would have gotten mangled just like the rest of others that became metal scraps on that fateful morning.

<b>How does the Cruiser fare on the government crash test?</b>

Back in 2000, the Highway Traffic Safety Administration paid up to 11,000 over list price for two cruisers which were destined to be crashed.  The cruisers only received two stars out of a possible five for protecting the head of the driver in a front-end crash.  It was found that the PT Cruiser fared better when it comes to protecting passengers.  Sorry about all of you, drivers!  The Cruiser received a four-star score for protecting the passengers in a front-end crash.  It received the same score for protecting passengers in a side-impact test crash.  Well, drivers, at least your wife or loved one will survive to enjoy this car!  Bear in mind that these tests were conducted in 2000.  Since then, the true test of the PT Cruiser has come from consumers like you who want your own PT as soon as a dealer can secure one for you.

<b>Can the PT Cruiser's competitors stand the heat?</b>

There is no question that the competitors would like to take over this niche.  It's been great for Chrysler ever since the PT Cruiser hit the marketplace.  Some of its competitors include:  2002 Ford Escape, 2002 Subaru Forester, 2002 Suzuki Grand Vitara, 2002 Kia Sportage, 2001 Toyota RAVA etc.  All models are powered by a 2.4 l four-cylinder engines.  Four-speed automatic transmission is available on all models except the Dream Cruiser.  The Limited Edition cruiser, belonging to my buddy, is a limited edition.  When I test-drove it, I realized how neat the driver's seat was.  Depending on the size and height of your family members, there may be some adjustments to do.  All the seats are genuine leather. 

<b>Other features you will sure appreciate</b>

Some of the standard equipments include dual front airbags, child safety seat anchors, power windows, side door high beams, aluminum wheels, remote keyless entry and theft deterrent, CD and AM/FM stereo.

<b>My impressions</b>

The PT cruiser is truly a leisure car.  It shows your position in life.  It's a lifestyle car that brings back great memories of a not-too-distant past.  It was the glorious days of the automobile industry.  There is no doubt that driving this car is more about one feels and the attention one gets from the public.

I had a great time test-driving it on the foothills of Yosemite.
