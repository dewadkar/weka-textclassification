            Getting up and running was simple and quick. There was a "first time use" setup menu that helped. The pictures look fantastic. The best part was how easy it was to hook up the camera to my Mac Powerbook. It was literally "Plug and Play". I hooked up the USB cable and in a few moments, an "untitled" icon appeared on my desktop. From there, it was all very intuative. Each photo appeared as a Quicktime file. I dragged the files over to my hard drive to play with them in Photoshop. Easy as pie. In fact, you can upload pictures to the camera by dragging them to the camera. 

The only complaint that I have is that the battery life is short.Since this is my first digital camera, I have nothing else to judge this against, but if you keep the LCD display on all the time, you won't get more than about 10 minutes on 4 AA bateries. I know keep the display off when posible. But you may lose a few settings when you switch batteries, so you have to turn on the diplay to set them. I will buy the AC adapter so that this will be less of an issue. I found this camera for $499.
