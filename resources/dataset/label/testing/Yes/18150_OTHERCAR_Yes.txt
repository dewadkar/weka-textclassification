            My 1994 Nissan Quest just rolled into 100000 miles!  The van is still running as smooth and reliable as the day I bought it in 1996 with 30000 miles on it.

I have had minimal trips to the mechanic for the usual things like brake, tire and battery replacement.  Everything else has held its own.

The seating arrangements  are comfortable with captains chairs in the front, a two seat bench in the middle and room for 3 in the back.  The back seat comes out altogether and the middle bench can slide forward for extra room in case you need to haul any large objects.

When all the seats are in, the storage area in the back could be a little roomier.

All in all the Nissan is a very smooth and comfortable ride, roomy enough to keep the little ones apart, ( less arguing that way!) And I look forward to many more miles of driving!<br><br>
