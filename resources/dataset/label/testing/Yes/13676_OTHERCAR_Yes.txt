            After 2 ISUZU Rodeos in succession and with one young child and another on the way we decided we needed something a little bigger. After looking at just about every SUV on the market we  eventually went back to ISUZU and traded up to the Trooper. 

A little wider, longer and taller than the Rodeo it provides the additional space we needed. There is room for 5 large passengers and the front seats are firm and supportive. There is plenty of rear luggage space and with the rear seat folded flat it is possible to carry quite large objects which fit easily through a clever split rear door that can be opened full width with no cargo lip for easy loading. 

Performance from the 3.5L V6 is good although don't expect great fuel economy. This is a large, heavy, boxy vehicle with the aerodynamics of a brick wall. On average we get 14 mpg around town and 19 mpg on the highway (depending on conditions).

This vehicle may not be the most fashionable SUV on the street but it is robust, practical and the build quality is excellent (at least on ours). We have driven 15,000 miles so far, mostly in NE and the Trooper has been rock solid through all conditions from snow storm to heat wave.

Shop around and there are some great deals available.
