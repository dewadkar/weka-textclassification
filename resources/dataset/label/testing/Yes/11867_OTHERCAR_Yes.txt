            The Honda Civic was really not on my list of "most wanted cars" but after owning a SUV that sucked my savings account dry and my company moving and requiring a commute, it started looking better and better. 

Honda Civic 4 door comes with three model choices: 
HX model is the bottom line that really is just the car minus the fancy schmancy features, that means no a/c and no automatic windows or doors. If you are really pinching the pennies then get this model but be mindful, you might regret it in the summer.
The LX model is the model I have and I'm pretty happy with the features it offers. It comes with the a/c and automatic windows and door locks. All in all this model offers the essentials of what most people are looking for in a car. The gas mileage is unbelievable, I made the trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco (about 400 miles) on a single tank of gas. As far as that commute driving, I go about 30 miles each way to work and only need to fill up once a week. I have 20k miles on it now and have been very religious about the tune-ups and so far, not a single problem. As far as space goes, it's kind of a tight fit, especially if you have anyone over 5'8 but hey, this is a compact. The back seats fold down increasing the cargo space and this has come in handy, especially when hitting Ikea. I can say, I did a week long camping trip in this car and it pulled through like a trooper. 
The top of the line is the EX model. Basically, I think the only real difference from the EX and the LX is the moonroof. There could be more but nothing so important that I managed to remember.  

Another thing to consider in the price is if you want automatic or transmission there is about an $800- $1000 difference. 

Buying tip: Go down to the dealership and get the test drive out of the way. If you want to get the best deal, go to one of the "get a quote" websites and do all your haggling online with the dealrships. This could save you a couple of thousand, driving around time and a lot of headaches, it did me.
