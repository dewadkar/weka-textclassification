            My daughter rolled her 1993 Sunbird to avoid hitting a deer, so we went car shopping. After what seemed like days of haggling with dealers and being treated like stupid women, we went to the Kia dealer. 
What a nice change, we were treated with respect and they answered every question we had, no matter how silly it seemed. She ended up buying the cheapest Sephia offered, with no frills. No air conditioning - not that we need it much in Michigan. A 5 speed manual transmission, even though she didn't know how to drive one. She said that for that price, she'd learn - which she did.
She bought the black one with a spoiler, what a beautiful little car. The gas mileage is wonderful and it's actually very comfortable. Another perk is the heavy frame. Her car was stolen about a week after buying it and when it was found the front end was smashed in. The metal is like that of a race car and it crumples right up when it's hit, but the frame withstood the damage and the car is good as new again.
I work for a auto dealer and I'm aware of the pros and cons of many types of vehicles. Overall, the Sephia is the one I'd recommend to anyone wanting a new car without the high price tag.<br><br>
