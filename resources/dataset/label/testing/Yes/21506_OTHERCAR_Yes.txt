            I am a long time admirer of European auto makers, and have been waiting for a great value in a luxury car.  That's right, a luxury car.  My 2000 Golf GLS TDI can surely be considered a luxury with its many extra features or without.  The ride of this nimble hatch back is far superior to many vehicles priced much higher, without compromising quality.  

I have owned my black four door almost two months now, though my odometer reading would cause most to doubt that; 10,000 KM (Canadian Owned)  The reason for the high mileage is not only because I use the vehicle daily as a sales representative, but rather due to the fact that I am free to travel as far as I wish, every weekend.  The soaring costs of fuel simply don't apply to this car.  I've never been a penny pincher and fuel consumption has never entered the equation when making decisions about what vehicle is right for me.  I have always looked at numbers relating to speed, power and performance.  The fact that my pocket rocket cruises past so many gas stations is only a perk in my book.  The real reason I love this car is simply because it is fun to drive, anytime.

Because of the changing weather in British Columbia, I've had the opportunity to drive this car in every kind of road condition imaginable; blinding blizzards, torrential rains, gusting winds and muddy back roads where my dealer would rather not know about.  My conclusion only makes me wonder why I don't just go ahead and sell these cars myself.  They can't be beat.

By far the nicest option I choose was the heated seats.  I've actually had friends asking if they could just stay in the car a bit longer, even when we'd already been on the road for three hours.  I use them even on a hot day with the A/C to ensure that I don't melt entirely.  

The only option I choose to pass on was the sunroof.. just can't justify the dollars considering our wet climate.  I had read many epinions posted here before I made my purchase, and would agree with most comments, both negative and positive.  The cup holders need re-tooling, though work well with the right travel mug - no big deal.  The back seats are a hassle to fold down when having to remove the headrests - and leave little room up front for anyone standing taller than 5'8&quot;. (I'm 6'4&quot;)  One comment I did disagree with related to the cruise control.  I read a review from a driver who felt that the diesel was underpowered. 

The author claimed to experience a 10-15 mp/h loss in speed when traversing hills.  The third weekend I had my car, I decided to take a trip up the Coquihalla highway from Chilliwack to Merrit.  This road is infamous for its long, steep gradient hills. (also the cars first test in blizzard conditions) I locked in the cruise control at 130 kmp/h as I approached 9 mile hill - the name says it all.  Not only did the diesel fly up that hill in fifth gear, but it did it with no noticeable loss in speed.  I sensed no difference in the cruise controls capability from flat driving to mountainous climbs.  Of course when I explained my reason for speeding to the highway patrol, they were more curious than forgiving.  An accompanying officer informed me that he owned an 87 diesel Jetta, and asked how I liked my new car.  After twenty minutes of show and tell alongside the dark highway, I actually had to ask if I was free to go.  I can say that the two officers were at least lenient in the end.

All in all I have very few complaints, even though I did experience a defective master cylynder after only 1500 KM.. these things happen.  My problem was dealt with quickly and it only illustrated to me that I choose the right car.  For as loaner vehicles, I had both a gas fueled Passat and a gas fueled Golf - I just couldn't wait to get my diesel back !  No comparison. The gas powered vehicles were simply too strained at normal highway speeds, likely due to the lack of torque.  My diesel purrs at 3000 RPM in fifth gear, at a speed of 140 kmp/h.  

If you're exploring the back roads of BC this weekend, keep your eyes open for a smiling Golf driver with bikes on the roof, dogs in the back and a trail of dust behind him.   <br><br>
