            After nine months of ownership and intense usage, I have fallen in love with this camera.  Extremely easy to use, it also comes with a laminated 'quick tour' sheet.  I bought it on-line and while waiting for it to arrive I spend about an hour on the Kodak home page taking the DC-240 tour - an invaluable experience so if you buy one definitely do that.

When I bought the camera I purchased a 48MB additional picture card - it holds 120 pictures at the highest resolution and over 1,000 at low resolution.  This was the best money I spent and I use the original 8MB card for backup only.  I honestly don't know how Sony can push the floppy disk camera's because saving the highest quality images as JPEG's my images routinely go over 500K.  This would mean only two pictures would fit on a floppy disk.

Kodak sends along both Mac/PC versions of Adobe Business PhotoDeluxe software.  It is a very good piece of software and threw away my previous photo-editor after trying it.  Usually free software is a &quot;light-edition&quot;, but this is the full blown package.  

I have an old Dell Pentium 133 so I was very impressed when Windows '95 installed the drivers without a hitch.  A later upgrade to Windows '98 cause no problems.

Kodak sends four rechargeable batteries and a recharger along with the camera, but I recommend spending another $15 and getting the AC Adapter.  Uploads suck the life out of the batteries.

The camera literally has hundreds of features and settings so I can't go into them here.  What I will say is this camera is very well thought out, easy to use, and the picture quality is superb.  A definite 'best buy' in the digital camera market.<br><br>
