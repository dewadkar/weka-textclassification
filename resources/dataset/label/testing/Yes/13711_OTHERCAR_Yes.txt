            I have owned my Eldorado for two years and I can tell you it is a SPOILER!!  I bought the car because I had always wanted a superior
vehicle with the styling and comfort only Cadillac can provide.

I live in the midwest where much of the year is cold with lots of snow and consequently, bad roads.  When I slide into the drivers seat and turn on the heated seat and drive icy or snowy roads I have the security of knowing I am very comfortable and safe with the FWD. Just after I purchased this vehicle in Denver, we were driving on the four lane highway  on a cold day when the icy slush was everywhere.  My husband saw
a difficult situation developing ahead of us and began to brake.  Just
in front of us a car flipped on its roof and other cars in front of us plowed into the overturned vehicle.  We were the first on-coming vehicle NOT involved in this multiple-vehicle pile-up because of the superior braking system on the Eldorado.  
  
And STYLE.  Wow.  I was at the store the other day when a boy of about 16 approached my car.  I rolled down the window somewhat reluctantly,  wondering what he wanted.  He said, &quot;What year is this car?&quot;.  I told him '98 and he began to enthuse about how this was his dream car--the car he had always wanted and how much was it.  I told him and when he recovered from the shock I suggested that he stay in school and go to college so he could afford one someday.

The Northstar engine is excellent with great performance and speed when you need it.  

If you are looking at the luxury car market this is one car you should test drive.  
If you are looking for a car for two people this is it.  The back seat is a little hard to get in and out of no matter what your age.  But if its
just the two of you and you want to travel or just drive around town in the best--buy an Eldorado.  You won't be sorry.<br><br>
