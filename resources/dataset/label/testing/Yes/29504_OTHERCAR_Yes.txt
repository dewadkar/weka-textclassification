            I got a new Kodak DC240 for christmas and I love it. It's the best digital camera I could have asked for. Sure, it may be a bit pricey, but hey, it was a gift. :-) Besides, I'd be glad to pay $500 of my own money for such an awesome camera. 

This camera has more features than I know what to do with. It has 2x optical zoom built into the lens and 3x digital zoom, which is incredibly easy to use with just the push of a button. The mode dial makes it extremely easy to switch to different features of the camera, such as camera setup, capture, review, and connect. It takes perfectly clear pictures at up to 1.3 megapixels, which almost seems like overkill since it almost becomes scary to see my ugly mug with that kind of detail. It comes with a plentiful 8MB flash card, which is enough for about 20 pics at the highest quality and the highest resolution. It has excellent setup features, which are pretty self explanitory and easy to use as well. 

The only negative feature I've found other than the price tag is that this, like many other digital cameras, eats up batteries pretty quickly. Fortuneately, though, the people at Kodak were nice enough to throw in a rechargable battery pack and the charger, so drained batteries are no longer a problem. <br><br>
