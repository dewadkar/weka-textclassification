            I absolutely love my 4Runner! I was planning on getting a smaller car, but my dad told me i needed a bigger car.. so i tried looking at SUV's and i absolutely fell in love with Toyota 4Runner's. I am expecting a child soon, and it will be perfect to put the stroller, playpen, etc. in. It is a very easy car to drive and extremely comfortable. The year 1997 for the 4Runner also rated very high in consumer reports, so i feel very confident driving it! The only nagative thing about it is that it can be a very bumpy ride on some roads because it is built like a truck.<br><br>
