            I really wanted a digital camera that was at least 3 MP but couldn't justify spending $400 or more on some of the other models.  When this one was at Staples for $299 plus a 64MB card, I bought it.  It does take nice pictures.  The software seems to work well.  It doesn't take but a second to upload to my computer using the USB connection.  I did not purchase the docking station for it.

I mostly take pictures of the kids but also take pictures of livestock for friends.  I did notice that when you start using the digital zoom (uses optical first and then goes to digital) that my pictures sometimes come out fuzzy.  I dont' know if this is a problem with all digital zooms.

There is a delay between pushing the shutter button and the shutter releasing.  Sometimes it is annoying (livestock moving out of frame).  A few times it has actually helped me get better pictures of the kids; by the time the shutter went off they had normal smiles not cheese head grins.

The battery life seems liveable.  I purchased rechargeables but haven't used them yet.  I am using the ones that came with the camera.  I have taken approximately 60 pictures using the LCD for each of them.  

The camera allows you to turn off the LCD that displays the pictures while you are taking them (this is supposed to save battery life).  Be aware that when using the digital zoom a box appears on the LCD to frame what you are taking a picture of.  The more digital zoom you use the smaller the box is.  The area of the digitally zoomed picture will be smaller than the area of the LCD until after the picture is taken.  After the picture has been taken the picture will appear normally (the same size as the LCD).

The camera does not allow you to use accessory lenses or filters.  The camera lens is covered and recessed into the camera body when it is turned off and it does not need a lens cover.  

The camera does not have a lot of the fancy options that some other cameras offer such as sepia or black and white, etcetera.
