            My mother went shopping for a new car after our Pontiac died out, and she was looking for a more stylish car. She came across this emerald black nissan maxima at the dealership, brand new. One test drive and a lot of talk was all it took to convince her to make this purchase. This car does drive well, ... not at all hard to manuver. Everything about this car was top knotch until it reached it's fourth year. I knocked it around a little by driving it into a ditch when i first got my license (oops), and has steered oddly since then. Other things have torn up, not dealing with the incident. The heater/air conditioner only works on full blast. The &quot;check engine&quot; light is stuck on and we paid $150 to have the thing fixed and it did it again two days later. Other than these things, this car has been very dependable. I do recommend the purchase of this car, although i havent been in a new model.<br><br>
