            After having owned Chevrolet products for 28 years, I decided to trade my 1995 Chevrolet Tahoe for a new 2000 Silverado. I had read that the new Chevy trucks had the most powerful engines as well as four wheel anti-lock Disk brakes and rack and pinion steering. It was voted Motor Trend truck of the year as well. My experience with Chevrolet and the available engine Power and disk brakes were the primary reasons for my deciding to purchase the 2000 model. 

The stop and go features are what I like most about the truck. It has lots of power and has a good solid brake pedal even with hard braking. Chevrolet obviously listened to their customers, as the earlier models had mushy brakes. Chevy has always tried to take the lead in horsepower, and they have not let us down with the 2000.

Unfortunately, I discovered the truck had an annoying vibration from about 65mph on up. The steering wheel vibrated back and forth, and vibrations were felt up through the seat and floor. After several returns to the dealer from which I bought the truck, and conversations with Chevrolet Customer service, the truck still had the vibration. At this point I was very dissatisfied with the whole experience. I contacted both my dealer and Chevrolet, informing them that I would give them one more chance, and then I would be invoking my states lemon law, which would force them to take the truck back. I did not feel that I was being unreasonable in requiring a brand new vehicle to ride properly. Chevrolet suggested I take it to another dealership, for the final repair attempt. I did that. 

The second dealership (Thornton Chevrolet) took the vehicle in with a smile, and assurances that they knew what the problem was, and that they would not return the vehicle to me unless it was fixed. They called the next day and said it was fixed. They had replaced the Goodyear tires with Mischelens. Now I had suspected the tires all along, but my first dealer would not accept that. 

Now the truck drives and performs quite well. I am very happy with it at this time. The only thing I don't like about it is it's low stance. I have the 1/2 ton two wheel drive version, and when I hook up my 16ft flat trailer, it sits even lower. The four wheel drive model doesn't sit much higher, and if it didn't have 4X4 painted on the back, you could not tell it was a four wheel drive. I assume the stance is responsable for the smoother ride, so there are tradeoffs. 

To Chevrolet's credit, their customer service department was courteous and helpful. They stayed on top of the dealership and the situation until it was resolved. Apparently it was just a bad dealership issue. I will not be returning to the dealership from which I bought the truck, and will be steering everyone I know away from it.

The bottom line for me is, The new Chevrolet Silverado is everything it is advertised to be. It is strong and comfortable. It is priced above its Ford and Dodge counterparts, but you will pay a little extra for the performance. The competitors comparablely equipped trucks are gutless in comparison. The Dodge I drove rode rougher and could barely get out of it's own way. The dodge also gets terrible gas mileage for the lack of power. The Ford I drove was comfortable ride, but also lacked power with the base V8 engine. The looks of the Ford are also an acquired taste. 

So if you are looking for a powerful smooth riding truck, and don't mind paying a little more to get it, the Chevrolet is the way to go. The 1/2 ton version is a great daily driver which is fun to drive because of the available power, and decent milage. It is Ok as a truck which is used for light hauling and utility, but don't put a lot of weight on it as it will drag ass. The suspension is inadequate compared to the available power and torque from the engine. The half ton version is best suited for the sport truck enthusist who is looking for a fast truck which can still haul the groceries and funiture. If you are looking for a work truck to hual and pull trailers, you should go for the 3/4 ton Dodge with the cummings diesel, or the 3/4 ton Chevy with the big engine. <br><br>
