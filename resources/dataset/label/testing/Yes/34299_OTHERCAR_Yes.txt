            I had been looking at trucks for about six months now. When I finally came across a 1996 Dodge Ram 1500 Club Cap. This truck was just what I needed. Not only for my family to ride in but it also makes a great work truck. There were a lot of reasons that I like this truck and no reasons that I could find that would make me not like this truck.

Here are the reasons that I like this truck:

1. A great truck for work reasons
2. A lot of room for the whole family
3. The fact that it does not take a lot of gas to drive this truck
4. Room for the people in the back seat to put their feet

And there were many, many more reasons that I bought this truck. This is a great truck if you need a work truck but also want a truck to take you family around town in.<br><br>
