            I recently picked up this handly little digital on Clearance at Office Depot. I wasn't particularly looking to buy one at that time, but the price was very low compaired to other equivalent 2.0 megapixel cameras.

It is very easy to use, and operates just like a point and shoot film camera. If you prefer to use a screen view as opposed to using the viewfinder,it has that capability also. The LCD display screen is very bright and helps with composure of your photo. You can also review pictures you have already taken with one touch of the REVIEW button!

The 4200CX has 2x digital zoom for close ups. I wish I had a little more range, but for the price I won't complain! It also has selectable flash modes. In the auto mode, the camera will take an internal light reading and if flash will be required for a properly exposed shot, it will fire on it's own. You can turn the flash completely off for those shilloutte shots, or choose for the flash to fire every shot for fill in flash outdoors.

If you would like to be part of the action, the camera does have a tripod attachment on the bottom. You can attach the camera to a tripod and set it's 10 second self timer to be part of the picture yourself!

I could see where the menu buttons could be difficult to operate for persons with larger hands. It is made much like the old original Nintendo controllers, a wheel type button with up down and right and left and an OK button in the middle...

The only real complaint I have is the fact that after 40 pictures (it holds up to 72 on the smallest photo size setting of 8x10) the batteries are dead. If you remove the batteries before you transfer your pics to your computer, you loose all of the pictures taken before battery change if you are not using a memory card! (Thank god I tested that out before I lost anything) You can use a 3V adaptor to plug it into the wall, but isn't that defeating the purpose of a small, portable camera? I would recommend buying rechargables if you intend on using this camera often. I would also purchase the optional Scan Disk Memory cards for travel, incase your batteries die out on you...

You DO NOT need to purchase the optional dock Kodak pushes with this product. It comes with its own USB port cord. All you had to do is load the included software into your computer, connect the camera via the USB cord and turn the camera on. The computer does the rest for you! SIMPLE!
