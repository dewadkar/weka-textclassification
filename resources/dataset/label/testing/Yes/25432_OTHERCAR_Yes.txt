            I leased this vehicle in August of 1997, and was pretty happy to end up with the new model for 1998.  I have to admit I was enthralled with it in the beginning, but soon started to have some minor complaints here and there after a few months.  To begin with, the heater and A/C control knobs.  They are the sliding kind, to get the interior of the car warm/cold...or to distribute the air to the defroster, or the feet area, etc..  I found it real annoying to play with as I was driving, and thought the circular knobs in my friends new Mitsubishi were easier to manipulate.  
     The dashboard, and controls also have the feel of cheap plastic, and I expected something more for a car that invoiced for $19500 loaded with all the bells and whistles.
     The automatic transmission I found to switch gears smoothly from the start position, but if you hit the brakes, and begin to speed up it sort of clunked through the gears...
     I've had the car for approximately 3 1/2 years and I do like it, it runs well, I have had no major mechanical problems with it, and it handles great in the rain/snow with the traction control.  Overall I have had a good experience with Saturn, especially with their customer service--and would recommend the car to anyone looking for a car that gets great gas mileage, is comfortable, and has a reasonably peppy engine.
