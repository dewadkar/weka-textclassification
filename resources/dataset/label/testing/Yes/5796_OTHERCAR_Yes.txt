            From my experiences with the Olympus Camedia series cameras, I have no problem saying that these are some of the best quality cameras on the consumer market.  

From talking with many people that have the cameras and from playing with them myself, I do have one note about the Olympus cameras:

READ THE FREAKING MANUAL!!!!!

As long as you read the book that comes with the camera (Olympus provides some of the best documentation out there when it comes to digital cameras) you should have no problem figuring out how to do anything and everything you have ever wanted to do with any point-and-shoot camera, whether film based or digital.

If you are looking for a potential replacement to a 35mm or APS point-and-shoot, then the D490 is an excellent choice.  

The movie feature on this camera allows you to record short movie clips in quicktime format.  The 2.1 MP CCD does a relatively good job of low-quality capture in this respect.

Still pictures cam be captured at a maximum of 1600x1200 resolution, which is sufficient for a decent print of an 8" by 10" picture print.  Although there are other options that will allow you to take pics at lower resolution, it is not recommended because you will lose a lot of detail when the pics are printed.

In the end, the Olympus D490 Zoom is a solidly built, reliable camera that takes excellent pictures and it relatively easy to use as long as you read the manual.  It makes for an excellent family camera because of its' versatility and capability to take high resolution pictures.

If you are looking for a camera that will take pics of the kids to send to grandparents as well as one that will capture the sights of a family vacation, the Olympus D490 is the digital camera for you!
