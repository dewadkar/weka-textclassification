            As a previous Honda Civic owner, I was real reluctant to buy an American car.  I had my share of woes to tell.  However, when my mother-in-law bought this car, she loved it and never complained about any quality issues.  So with a great financing rate, I decided to give it a try.

Wow!  What a car.  Admittedly I did have 2 problems with the car when I bought it new from the dealer.  However the dealer replaced the defective radio and a bad engine sensor plug -- which took care of both my problems.  18,000 miles later and not a single problem!  Chevy has come a long way and this car has been as reliable for me as my old Civic which also had some initial quality problems.

Now for the accolades...the car has the room and power to make it functional for any family, and fun to drive.  I recently packed 6 adults (using my front bench seat), and all our luggage in it for a summer vacation to Montreal.  We found it to be as comfortable as a mini-van, but with much better mileage.  Speaking of mileage...you can't beat 31 MPG for a V6!

The negatives are few, but here they are:  Although it was fixed right away, it was still annoying that I had 2 problems with the car out of the show-room.  Also, I have the base sedan, and I find the "Touring Suspension" a little loose for my taste.  Finally the bass on the radio is set too high for the preset modes.
