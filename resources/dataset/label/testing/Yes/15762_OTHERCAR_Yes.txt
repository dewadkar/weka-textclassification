            Throughout my 4 years at college, I drove a 1992 Jeep Cherokee.  It had a 4.0 liter Straight 6 motor, 4 doors, tinted windows, and all kinds of trim.  Yes, it was fine and everybody loved it.

The reason why I say it is great for college is that it is VERY roomy!  I did not have to have any help when moving into my dorm and it's not because I didn't have a lot of stuff.  I had a large computer chair, my computer, a tv, stereo, vcr, my guitar, a box fan, and tons of clothes and other stuff like an iron, laundry basket, etc.  I had my Jeep filled up so much that you could barely see out the back window, but it still held everything.  My roomate had a smaller Mitsubishi car and he had to make 3 trips from the dorm to home (a 4 hour drive), before he got everything in, and he had less stuff than I did.

The Cherokee has long been a status symbol and was around before the overused term &quot;SUV&quot; was ever thought of.  Although it has a pretty big 6 cylinder motor, it got around 20-22 miles per gallon and was VERY peppy.  When out on the highway or interstate, if you wanted to pass someone you just give it a little gas and you can zip right around them.  A very nice highway patrolman can vouch for me being able to pass people with ease.

Despite it's size, the Cherokee handles very much like a car and has a lot of ground clearance.  I have heard that they can be easy to flip, but only if you are dumb enough to cut the wheel sharply while going too fast.  It is a little noisy on the inside, but that can be overcome by a great stereo system and plenty of room to add more speakers if you so desire.

Parents, if you are thinking of buying your 'baby' something safe, reliable, economical, and darn good looking, to drive to college (or anywhere else), I suggest you look into the Jeep Cherokees.  They offer a wide variety of prices and packages, and also have a very high resale value because they are so desirable.  When I sold mine 2 years ago, it took me less than a week to find a buyer, and I just parked it in my front yard with a for sale sign.  Jeep Cherokee's sell themselves.<br><br>
