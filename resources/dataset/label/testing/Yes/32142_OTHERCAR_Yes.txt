            1999 Daewoo Lanos 3 door hatchback. White with grey Interior S Version. Automatic Transmission. Picked up with 112 Miles, Returned with 3215 Miles.

I just LOVE this car!  I drove it for about 2 months while my BMW coupe  was in the shop being repaired.  When the rental guy told me I would be getting a DAEWOO for 26 bucks a day I wasn't too excited about the idea of driving a microwave or a toaster. When I showed up to pick-up my toaster I saw a really good looking car.  The lines were great, very wide stance for a little car, looked stable and the curved rear end looked tough.  Lots of visibility, cool headlights, fog lights, flared fenders and lots of interior room. That's a lot to say about a car under 9 grand retail!

Driving Experience: I expected the worst.  I figured it would drive like an old Hyundai, Neon, or even worse a Ford Escort (review forthcoming).  I was surprised.  This car was quiet, peppy, roomy, well-handling, and really had a stable well mannered ride.  As for it's size, weight and suspension, it really did nicely with 105HP.  The gearbox (auto) is very smooth when driven casually but aggressive when you step on it.  Gear shifts were predictable and appropriate.  Highway cruising, a non-issue, this car is very comfortable, and easy to drive.

Ergonomics:  Very comfortable driving position, primary and secondary controls in easy reach.  Radio (mine didn't even have a tape deck) actually very good.  Stock speakers plenty good enough for most.  CD player available as an option.  A/C worked like a new car should!  Headlights surprisingly bright!  Seats very adjustable, plenty of room in the back too!

Since I was driving a rental, I really pushed this little car.  I darted off the line at every stoplight almost always beating out the guy next to me. &quot;Wolf in sheeps clothing&quot; I would tell me girlfriend who seemed to really get a kick out of how much I liked this car. Handled well off-road ! Nothing broke, didn't get stuck, no weird noises, nothing.  It cleaned up nicely too.  I hate to say it but the Valets in Beverly Hills didn't leave my Lanos out front next to the Bentleys and the Porsches, but one should feel good knowing it's paid for...

So when the time came to return my little Lanos, I was very sad.  There is something cool about having a $9,000 car that has a &quot;following.&quot;  Other Lanos owners (they are popping up all over LA now) actually waved and honked at me.  I would hear people in Civics say &quot;what kind of car is that?&quot; If they only knew... they might have another 7 Grand in their pocket.

Highly Recommended!

LANOS!!!! I wonder if there is a club?
