            I've driven my SE-R now for 8 years.  We've been 75,000 miles together, and almost all of them have been a blast.  I have searched high and low for a car on the market today to replace my ailing SE-R, and since none have caught my attention I just keep repairing it and going on.  I could never get rid of it anyways.  I've yet to find such an unassuming, inexpensive, sensible car to drive.  I can't imagine being without it.  The majority of the population gives me a crazy eye when I boast about my car's handling and performance, but those who have driven it understand.  I have raced it in the past, but since I need a car to drive and autocrossing tears it up, it has retired.  Repairs so far have been minimal for a car of its age.  Both CV joints and boots have been replaced.  My car like a lot of others with the SR20DE engine had 5th gear popout at 68k.  That required a whole new fifth gear and transmission rebuild.  The clutch didn't last as long as I had hoped, but at least that is an expected wear and tear.  Otherwise this car is great.  If you are able to find a 91 or 92 model in decent condition-you won't regret the small amount of cash it will cost.
