            I had the pleasure of owning a 99 Civic SI for about a year - more on time frame later.  This is a great little car.
It was the first Honda I purchased, and I must say, I was very impressed.  It cost me about 18,000 +++ Canadian back in 98 when I baught it new.  For the money it was a great deal.
Performance/Handling
The performance on it was not too bad for a small 4 cylinder car.  Afterall, it only pushes 121 horses.  The suspension was decent.  But not enough.  I made some modifications to the car...see below, which turned out good.
Interior/Comfort
The interior is pretty simple.  Not a bad CD system and set of speakers.  No air in mine - that sucked!  
Modifications
I threw a set of 17" rims on it and low profile yoko.  This made the car look silly, so I had to drop it 3", which definately helped the suspension stick to those tight corners!  I added Strut bars, and stabilizers, and now it was handling sweet!
Next came the fun.  I ripped out the exhaust from the CAT back and threw in a mandrel bent system.  Next came the intake - cold air from AEM.  All in all I added maybe 5-10 horses - still not enough.
I ended up purchasing a new ZEX kit for a great price and decided to put it to use on the Civic.  Wow, you want to feel speed.  A 75 shot of NOS put this basically stock car into the low 14s.  Not too bad.
However, the Civic has a very weak bottom end on the motor.  After two fills of the NOS bottle I heard some pretty scary noises coming from this car.  Had my mechanic look into it, and he advised I replace the engine soon!  Needless to say - I sold the car.
I do not recommend going with any engine modifications unless to replace the bottom end of this car!
