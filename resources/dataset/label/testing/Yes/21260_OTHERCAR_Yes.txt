            The 2000 Camry LE V6 is a excellent car inside and out. If your looking for a well built and dependable car this is it. The 3.0 V6 is very smooth, so smooth you have to look at the tachometer to see if the engine is running. This particular model I drove was very well equipped, even had the optional power moonroof. Compared to the 2.2 4 cylinder this car is a different animal. With the LE you get cd player with cassette, power windows, power locks, all the equipment you would expect is all standard. I took one down to Miami last January from St.Petersburg and the ride was very comfortable, not floaty but smooth. The V6 engine had more than power to merge onto the freeway with no problem whatsoever. The seats are also comfortable, I personally like Toyotas headrests, you can adjust them foward and back. A couple of years back Nissan had a name for it's Maxima, it was called a 4DSC, it stood for 4 door sports car, well I think the Toyota Camry LE V6 could also be called a 4DSC, drive one and you'll agree.<br><br>
