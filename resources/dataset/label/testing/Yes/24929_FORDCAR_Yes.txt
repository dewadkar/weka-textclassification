            Every four years or so I trade my car for a new one. Ever since I started driving, I tested different cars and somehow I always ended up with an Explorer. They worked out really well for me but I never really new the difference. Recently I decided to trade my Explorer for a 35th Anniversary Ford Mustang. WOW if you like driving, the Mustang may not have the car space but it definitely makes it more fun, besides you can easily fit in 4 people. I really like the new look of the Mustangs comparing to the older versions. They have very good road traction which makes it easy to drive.
Every time I drive my Mustang I feel that I have a very high class vehicle which makes it seem that the price of the car is very convenient.<br><br>
