            This is my 2nd Jeep (first an '89 Limited and now a '00 Cherokee Laredo). I loved them both. However,you have to watch the details. For instance, the new Jeep has no lock on the glove box and the radio has no power antenna. Yes, I know these are little things. I would have bought the car anyway, but consider how useful a lock on the glove box is. Do you like to take off your antenna every time you want to run it though an automatic car wash? Maybe these are cost saving details. If so, I think they're poorly thought out.

Before you decide on which model to buy, use an online auto service to compare the prices for everything you want. I bought a Laredo rather than a Limited model with every option available and it cost me $3000 less. Besides, in the real world, having plastic covered splash panels instead of painted panels (as on the Limited) saves you a lot of cleaning problems. I think it looks better,too! Unless you just have to have an in car garage door opener and seat position memory, you can get everything you want on the Laredo. I think Chrysler is just cashing in on the SUV fad with the extra cost on the Limited.

Having said all that, with 18,000 miles on a 12 month old car (as I write this updated opinion)I've still had no problems or hints of problems. I took it in for a misaligned front end at 2 K miles and it's held ever since. On my '89 I replaced 4 water pumps because, according to the local service people, &quot;the pump runs backward which causes extra wear.&quot; I've been told no such problems occur with the new ones. I do hear more transmission and differential noise than I'm used to but I'm told that with the new Quadra Drive option, there's a lot of things going on down there. Only time will tell if the extra complexity causes any additional problems. I have a suspicion from past experience that it will not.

Two last thoughts. You might as well go for the V-8. Mileage will only be around 17-18 mpg city/highway, but that's a heavy car and the eight makes a lot of difference. Also I would recommend buying clear covers for your headlamps, driving lights and turn signal covers. I got mine from AutoSport on the web. They're optically clear thick plastic that has a self adhesive backing. You just press them on. They cost about $50 for the set but they could sure save several hundred dollars if you ever crack one of those clear light covers. Lastly (at the expense of repeating myself) using the internet to get price/option details and to get a tentative price from a dealer is the only smart way to go. I got price replies from as far as 500 miles away (I live in Texas, you know) My local dealer (the only guy in town) would have cost me an extra $1000 if I had dealt with him. As it was, a 45 mile trip to another state got me everything I wanted for $500 over invoice. You'll probably get a better deal if you order the car like I did. The wait should be no more than 4-6 weeks. The dealer gets to keep the &quot;holdback&quot; which makes it more attractive for them. I haven't seen any substantial changes in the 2000 year model but you might check those &quot;picky&quot; details just to be sure.
