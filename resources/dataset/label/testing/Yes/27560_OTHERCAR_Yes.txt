            This 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo was purchased new by my adult daughter.  One year and 15,000 miles later, as a bonus, her company gave her the full-time use of a new vehicle.  The Jeep then sat in her garage for over a year until she finally decided to sell it because she simply wasn't using it.  Her mother (my wife) announced that she wanted to buy it!  I objected strenuously, asserting that we certainly didn't need a truck (I've always owned sedans).  In any event, as with most things, my wife ignored my protestations and bought the vehicle.  In turn, I virtually ignored the Jeep over the next several months, letting my wife drive it.  Rather passively, I did notice that she seemed to be enjoying it and was not driving her car, a sporty little sedan.  Finally, she asked me to sell that car for lack of usage and I did.  It was obvious that she preferred the Jeep. I, however, continued to maintain my distance (she couldn't really be right, could she?).  By the late Fall of 1998 we were going to visit our son and his family in Tennessee.  I assumed, as before, that we would be flying.  A week before we were due to go, I asked my wife if she had gotten the airline tickets.  It was then that she told me that we were driving the Jeep.  She had too many things to take to our son's family and we simply could not take them on the plane.  The Jeep could hold all!  Although I insisted that there was no way I was going to drive that vehicle 950 miles, as one might suspect, I did!  We drove 600 miles the first day.  I expected to be completely beat.  I was not.  Quite frankly, by the end of that day's driving, the Jeep had won a new convert. I had none of the normal driving fatigue that I ordinarily would have.  And, the experience of sitting up above the traffic lent a whole new perspective to trip driving.  I couldn't believe it.  I was particularly impressed with the Jeep's handling; so responsive and so stable!  Now, my wife and I rush to see who gets the Jeep first.  That in spite of the fact that we bought her a new sporty sedan this Summer.  Frankly, my wife much prefers the Jeep with 50,000 miles now on it to her new car.  I usually have to drive the new vehicle.  Such is married life!<br><br>
