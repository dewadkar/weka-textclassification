            We have just recently purchased our second mpv.Our first was a 89`five passenger model.Our current model is a 91`,five speed also a five passenger.The purchase price was a mere $1900(cdn),with only 88000km on it.It was purchased from the original family that bought it new in 92 as a left over.
First off I`ve never been a fan of minivans,but our family of five really wasn`t fitting well in our chev corsica anymore.The styling of the mpv`s caught my eye,as did the japanese quality.We love the handling as it`s not that much different from most cars,well bigger cars anyway.
Our first modification took place yesterday as we purchased the back third row seat,complete with all belts.It was only $200 at the local auto wreckers and matched perfectly.For any one that has or is considering a five passenger model,you`ll be glad to know that all the mounting holes already exist,and are threaded.Though you should also get the rear plastic panels also.But this truly is an easy bolt on to do yourself in about two hours.
The five speed seems to work great to get the power from the 2.6L four cylinder,as our first one also a 2.6L was auto,what a difference.
The fuel mileage isn`t much worse than some cars but you do seem to have to fill up often as the tank is rather small.The interior is really user friendly,great for kids with lots of storage areas.I`d highly recommend one of these vans to anyone in the market.I think we may try an all wheel drive model next to see how they work.Although I understand that prior to purchase these really need a complete inspection by a competent and familiar mechaic.
