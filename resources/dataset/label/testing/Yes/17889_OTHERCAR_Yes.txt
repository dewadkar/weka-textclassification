            With a fully loaded base price with satellite navigation nearly $10,000 less that the Mercedes E320 and Lexus GS-300 it's 115&quot; wheelbase can't be ignored.  The RL only has 1 option, the large, simple to use 7&quot; DVD navigation system with is far easier to use than the &quot;COMAND&quot; system from Mercedes.  With the advancement in DVD data storeage one could make a trip from LA to NY without switching navigational discs as is required with the Mercedes system.

The car is just big, way bigger than similarly priced BMW 3 series, MB C-Class and the Lexus ES.  Acura is aggressively selling these cars and in turn is offering great lease specials.  It is fully appointed, quality is of Lexus standards, and the ride is plush.  New for 1999 is revised more aggressive sheet metal, more wood in the interior, xenon headlamps, larger Navigational display, wider wheels and tires and a tighter suspension, giving the RL more of a Lexus GS-400 ride and handling characteristics.    

My only gripe is the lack of a V-8 engine option.  The still unchanged 3.5L Acura power plant could use a going over as it's the last engine not to utilize the V-TEC variable valve timing system found on all the other Acura makes, including the $80K NSX.  The lack of power beneath the pedal leaves a little to be desired, although it does get out of it's own way.  

With that said, I'm sure I can get over losing at the stoplight gran prix given the extra weight of $10,000 in my wallet graciously left by the Acura dealership.  Anyone looking for a reliable, large, prestigious automobile need look no further, and with such high resale is much less expensive that any other cars approaching it's size, appointments and reliability.<br><br>
