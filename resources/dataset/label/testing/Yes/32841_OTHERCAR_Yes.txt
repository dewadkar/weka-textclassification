            I own a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier and I absolutely love it! It is GREAT on gas mileage and
I
         haven't had many problems with it and its 5 years old. The *only* problems that I
have
         had with my car was the power steering went out and it wasn't very expensive to fix.
         This car has a great sporty look but it wont hurt your pocketbook. A Cavalier is
MUCH
         cheaper than a sports car such as a Camaro. Sure a Cavalier isn't as sporty as a
Camaro
         but it is much more practical for families. Me my wife and two kids fit in it and still
have
         room for one more person conformably. I would highly recommend this car to a first
time
         buyer or people that are in family situations but do not want to go the mini-van
route
         yet. Smart, sporty, practical, affordable.<br><br>
