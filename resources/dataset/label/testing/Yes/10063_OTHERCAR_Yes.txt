            I can't really add much more than what has already been said in other opinions.  This is a great vehicle if you really like to get off the beaten path and still drive it to work very day. Don't expect it to handle like a car, because it is basically a truck. One feature that I haven't seen in other opinions is the accessories that are available for the Xterra.  There are all sort of roof racks to carry extra gear, snow boards, skis, boats, bicycles; interior protection items like vinyl cargo liners, water resistant seat covers, winter floor mats, cargo nets, etc. I've compared the Xterra to others costing thousands more and the other just couldn't match up when it came to all around versatility.  This is a great vehicle and would buy another in a heart beat, but it is made so well, I may not have to.<br><br>
