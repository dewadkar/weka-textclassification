            Recently, I decided to retire my trusty Nikon F3hp and go digital. I was tired of buying film and then shelling out big bucks to get the prints professionally done.  Typically, I burn through a lot of film each trip, and quickly came to the conclusion that digital would save me a lot of money in the long run.

<b>Why this camera caught my eye</b>
I started shopping around, comparing features of the various megapixel cameras. Olympus, Canon, and Kodak were popping up as peoples' favorites, but the camera that really caught my eye was the Nikon 990.  I prefer having total manual control with my cameras, and the 990 had all the features I wanted: manual focus, exposure compensation, multi-zone metering (including spot), exposure compensation, as well as adjustment for different lighting conditions (fluorescent, incandescent, daylight, etc.)--it even even displays a histogram for the shot. Just so I don't give the wrong impression, I should also say the camera does great auto-exposure and autofocus shots as well, so you don't need to play with the manual features to get great shots. While I believe this camera is geared towards those who appreciate the technicalities of photography, beginners will be able to quickly learn how to take great photos with the 990.

I won't run through the multitude of additional features this camera has, but suffice to say it has enough &quot;bells and whistles&quot; to keep me satisfied with my photographs. At first, the array of menu options was somewhat dizzying to me, but after a few hours of reading the manual and working the controls, I found settings that produce great photographs. Another feature I've been very impressed by is its ability to film Quicktime movies--even in macro. This function has proven to be a source of delight to me, as I can film short movies of friends, or even a bee buzzing around a flower!

<b>Beautiful colors and detail (with link to photos)</b>
Above everything, what impressed me about this camera is the detail and color quality it captures.  I've been used to shooting fine-grain color transparencies with Velvia and E100SW, but I was immediately impressed with the brightness, richness, and subtlety of the colors in my photographs. As for detail, it's simply amazing what this camera captures in macro mode.  Time and again, the camera captures detail that I could not see with my own eyes.  I love macro photography, and I'm simply impressed with what it can do.  <b>For an idea of the camera's capabilities, take a look at some of my photos (shot handheld): http://members3.clubphoto.com/curt238781/Macros_Page_1/ </b>I shot these by focusing manually through the viewscreen, proving this camera <i>can</i> function as a digital &quot;slr&quot;. Note: these photos are scaled down from the original 2048 x 1536 pixel photos. The actual photos are much more detailed.

<b>Other highpoints</b>
The tilt lens.  At first, holding this camera felt completely different from my Nikon F3 and F4, but now I really love being able to tilt the viewscreen to accommodate various shooting angles.  This way, I can have the camera at my waist, but still view the image area.  It's a great feature!  I also like the large grip of the 990 which allows me to take shots with just one hand. With the tilt and the grip, I can now get photos that wouldn't be possible with my older Nikons.

<b>One Limitation: Low-Light Photography</b>
While the CoolPix 990 performs great in many conditions, its inability to work well in low light might pose problems for those photographing indoors. Since the outdoors is my usual theme, this isn't too problematic.  Whenever I <i>do</i> shoot in darker surroundings, I'm forced to use the built-in flash, which quite frankly, doesn't work well. <b>Conclusion:</b> if you want to shoot indoors with this camera, you'll need to buy a external flash unit.
   
<b>Things I would change</b>
The camera is a battery glutton. At first, I ran through a set of alkalines in about 40 shots.  I've fixed this problem with getting rechargeable NiMH batteries, which save a <b>lot</b> of money in the long run. I also think Nikon should include a larger memory card, as the one they include will only hold 10 photos in &quot;fine&quot; resolution. While the features, construction, and interface of the camera is superb, I'll knock off one star due to these battery and memory issues.

If you're looking for a digital camera with superb color sensitivity that can capture amazing detail, then I'd definitely recommend the Nikon 990.<br><br>
