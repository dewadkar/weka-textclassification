            For less than $50, this is no professional digital camera but you get alot for the money.  It takes good clear shots of medium-to-distant objects that are of great web quality.  If you're looking for something inexpensive for putting photos of friends, etc., on the web or for email this is a great deal.

The drawbacks are mainly that it has no LCD viewfinder.  The built-in viewfinder works well for distant targets but not so well for targets within 6 feet or so.  Also, this is not very good for close-ups (~1 foot).

The serial connection is easy to set up and use.  It's important to use the AC adapter when downloading photos b/c the batteries for this baby can be expensive.

Also, the flash tends to wash out close-up shots, but in my experience the flash isn't needed at all for most shots.
