            I bought the Sony DSC-85 more by accident than by design.  After weeks of obsessing I decide to go for the Olympus C4040 which I bought at a very reasonable $499 at a Wolf Camera tent sale.  Only problem: the card reader broke within less than 48 hours.  I wanted a camera that weekend (and not wait six weeks for the Olympus to be fixed) and went for the Sony which was offered to me at the same price instead.
By and large I am happy with the camera.  It feels and looks like a "real" SRL which is what I was going for. If you are concerned with weight, however, this is not your camera. 

The quality of the pictures is great and handling of the camera is easy and intuitive.  I am not exactly a technically-minded person and I hate to read manuals but still got the hang of the camera pretty quickly. 

Given everything I read about battery life of other cameras, this one seems to do fairly well. I allegedly get about 3 hours out of the batteries before they have to be recharged - seems about right, although I never measured it. 

There are a number of things, however, I dislike, most importantly the limited aperture settings.  f/8 is at good as it gets and on bright days - even with a shutterspeed of 1/1000 - f/8 just isn't enough. f/16 would be the least I expect from a camera that normally retails for about $700.  I had to chuck a number of otherwise perfectly nice pictures because they were completely overexposed.  Maybe I overlooked some trick or hidden feature by not reading the manual carefully but so far I haven't found any way to adjust for very bright conditions.

The 8 MB memory stick is ludicrous.  I bought a 128 MB the day I bought the camera.  That works pretty nicely. 

Since I bought the camera about six weeks ago I took about 1000 pictures - pretty serious wear, I admit.  The control button, which is the most frequently used button (play back pictures, macro setting, flash setting, self-timer) is already showing some wear especially when playing back pictures.  This really shouldn�t happen after such a short time, even given the frequent use.

I rated the camera �above average� but that�s actually not a very good measure since this is the only camera I am using � therefore I don�t have an average.  In summary, I like the camera, but I would like it even better with those problems I mention taken care off.
