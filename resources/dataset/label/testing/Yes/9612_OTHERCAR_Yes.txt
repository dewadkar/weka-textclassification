                 Since my first ride in a Celica back in 1986, I could not wait to come back for more.  This was one of the few cars that I really fell in love with.  Its great handling and good acceleration really set me off.  I test drove a Celica recently, and was amazed by the ease of usage.  Being a first timer to use a standard shift I felt right at home, and was able to really churn up some pavement with the lightning quick acceleration.
     I thought that the handling was wonderful and well balanced.  With a decent amount of under steer, this would be the car to really make some beautiful slide turns.  If you are looking for a car with the sporty image this is one to check out and rip around in.
     The performance of this beast of a car is equal to or if not better than some of the best made German Automobiles of the 1980's.  With zero to sixty times of fewer than seven heartbeats this car would roast almost anything.  The Celica also has knife in the back handling and great grip to light up the corners of your favorite back road.
     The interior is one of the most roomy I have seen in a sports car ever.  I am used to the cramped interior of the 1983 Porsche 911 SC, this makes the Porsche look like a roller-skate.  Not to mention the fact that it is almost as quick.  The interior is well appointed and the switches are well placed, making them easy for the driver and passenger alike to reach.  The gauges are sporty, fitting the cars image; with a fiery red lettering they have really catches the eye.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I have ridden in lately and rival the comfort of the finest of cars.
     On the whole this is a great car, one of the finest, with so few flaws they are not even worth mentioning.  If you are going to buy something don't waste your money on something else get the Toyota Celica GT-S and get moving.
