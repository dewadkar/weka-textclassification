            I bought my Mirage because I was just out of college and needed a less expensive car.  I got a great deal.  The car has been perfect for me because it has had no mechanical problems.  As long as I take the car in for an oil change when it is needed and get the tires changed at standard intervals, the car keeps going.  I have had my Mirage for four years now without ever having a breakdown or any major repairs.  
The only things I dislike about this vehicle are that it is not very fast and it is a two door.  I wouldn't try racing somebody with a Mirage, because you will lose.  There's not much to be said about the fact that it is a two door, that was a choice I made.  
I think this car is perfect for someone who is just out of college and wants a less expensive highly dependable vehicle.  I drive a lot of rental cars in my line of business and I think the Mirage is one of the best cars I have driven.<br><br>
