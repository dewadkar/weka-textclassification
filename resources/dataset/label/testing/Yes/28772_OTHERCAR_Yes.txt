            <B>SONY = QUALITY</B>

If you think death and taxes are the only two things you can count on, think again. Add Sony's penchant for creating quality consumer electronics products to the list.

While doing research for my first ever digital camera purchase, two cameras made  the final cut: The Sony DSC-S75 and the Canon S30. Both are in the same price range ($400-$500), both are 3.x megapixel cameras and both got rave reviews from users and critics alike.

The decision between the two wasn't an easy one since the Sony S75 is much bulkier and heavier than the portable Canon S30 model. But since I am more familiar with Sony products, I felt comfortable in choosing the DSC-S75. Another deciding factor was that the S30's battery life isn't as long as the DSC-S75.


<B>DUDE, THE IMAGES!</B>

I have to say digital cameras have come a long way from when I started out using the circa 1997 Kodak DC50. The picture quality from the Sony DSC-S75 is simply amazing. The detail and sharpness are unsurpassed. The colors aren't perfect, but close enough. About the only negative thing I can say about the images is that sometimes there is a dark cast over them. I don't know if that's caused by the camera lens itself, or my novice photographic abilities. Maybe a combination of the two? Anyhow, when this happens, I adjust the image to my liking in Photoshop.

All in all, for a consumer level camera, the S75 takes high quality snapshots for a low price. You'd be hard pressed to find a similarly priced camera that can out do the S75.


<B>YES, BUT CAN IT KILL AT YAK AT 200 PACES?</B>

The DSC-S75 is an amazing value. Not only do you get great images from the camera, but also tons of features. Like what you ask? Well, for starters, how's about a 3x optical zoom lens with an option for 6x zoom via digital interpolation? Or a "macro" mode which makes extreme close up shots possible without blurring out. If that's not enough, you can also record video footage with this bad boy. The video can be as long as the memory stick capacity allows. For example, with a 128 mb stick, you can record video footage for as long as 90 minutes in its lowest resolution! Still not enough you say? You also have the ability to add effects to  your photos such as sepia tones, black and white tones, negative image or solarization. Your images can be saved as JPEGs or uncompressed TIFF files as well. Oh, and last but not least, the battery. It's rechargeable. It's compact. It's long lasting (Up to 3 hours). 'Nuff said.

There are so many other features, but I refuse to list them all for fear of sounding like an overzealous advertisement. I'll just say this... The amount you will spend on this camera is too little in proportion to the awesome arsenal this camera possesses.


<B>CAN MORONS USE IT TOO?</B>

Simply put, YES! If I can learn to use it, anyone can. The manual included is easily understood, just take the time to read it. There are step-by-step instructions on how to use its features. I'd say out of the box, it took me roughly two hours to get the hang of it. The DSC-S75 is definitely user friendly.

Transferring the images to your PC is also a snap. After a quick install of the software drivers provided, just hook the camera up to your computer with the USB cable (also included with the camera) and voila! The camera appears on your desktop like an external hard drive.


<B>SO WHAT'S THE CATCH?</B>

If there's is one minor complaint I must make, it's about that pathetic 8 mb memory stick included with the camera. With 8 megs, the camera is pretty useless. I think Sony did that just to make you buy more of their higher capacity proprietary memory sticks which you will inevitably have to do. I chose to forego the Sony brand memory stick and bought the cheaper Lexar stick, so take that Sony!

Also note, for those looking to upgrade their memory sticks, I'd recommend the highest capacity, 128 mb sticks. With the 128 mb stick, it is possible to take hundreds of shots without reloading. I only wish Sony would produce an even higher capacity memory stick since I take most of my photos at higher resolutions.

You know, if the only complaint I have about this camera is the memory stick issue, it is a minor price to pay for such an outstanding product. Value wise, I don't think you can beat it.


<B>4.23.02 UPDATE</B>

I just received the first batch of photos I took with my S75 from Kodak's Ofoto service. They look outstanding! I can't even tell the prints were taken with a digital camera. The color and sharpness in the prints went beyond my expectations.
