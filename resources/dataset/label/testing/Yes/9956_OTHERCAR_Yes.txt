            I own a bunch of Saab's:  '85 900 Turbo 4 door, 88 900 Turbo 3 door, '99 Saab 95, and now, a 00 Viggen.  The Viggen Makes the old SPG look like a lack of planning.  This car has so much power, room, and comfort, that no body can care about the only problem, Tourqe steer.  This car has a huge hauling capacity, great sound system, and comfortable seating.  I bought the 3 door version, but you can also get a convertible and 5 door.  You will not know the full power of Saab until you own this vehicle.  Have fun.<br><br>
