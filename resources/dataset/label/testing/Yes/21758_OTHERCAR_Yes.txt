            well I bought a 98 cavalier Z24 fully loaded brand new
I have been racing with it,lugged big families in it(toronto to florida)
around town everything 60,000 kilometres in two years.its a compact car so all the measurments are compacts I am 5,7 but no prob front or back.
as far as interior I like the roof height,stereo,seating,all of it even though its compact you get a bit more than others in its class.only dislikes for interior.I dont like how they are making interiors with excessive plastic moulding (rear elbow rest made rock hard plain)
or the fact I can never have more than two adults in the rear,I havent compared but there is a lack of trunk space in this car,I guess those 
are the only dislikes on the interior the plastic and rear seating.
the front seats are nice and the stereo is bangin.exterior I must say I would never buy a cavalier without the Z24 effects,you get a whole new front bumper,all around ground effects,nice five star rims and the red bow tie logos which show you cant be smoked like the less fortunate.
I think this car looks very rental car with out the Z package exterior
and very good with it.as for the motor well it lacks alot to be desired in a non z but in the z24 the only complaint is lack of oomph! above 55mph.this car specialty is gettin up to 45-50mph it is very torquey and loves to rev thru first and second than your on your own.more power at higher speeds is only complaint would I recomend it no I think it is a great buy over some other cars but you always want what you dont have and in that case there are others I would want to trade for or at least test drive though I have to say I am happy I bought it,there is very little wrong with it but also very little making it stick out as a true winner
(new celica for example) <br><br>
