            After 30 years of marriage my husband finally decided to let me choose my own car. After several months of looking, I came across a 96 Bonneville SSE.  Needless to say, after test driving the car I knew it was for me.  I have have it for three years and it is the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  My husbands brand new Ford Super Duty truck has gone in for recalls and repairs more in 1 year then my Bonneville in 3 years.  The ride is so smooth and the mileage is not bad at all.The added features are great.  Just recently a warning light came on and told me my tail light had burned out.  I will most likely make Bonneville my next choice. With 2 small grandchildren, I really appreciate the warning lights alerting you to a door ajar.  For all its added features and reliability, I without a doubt give it a thumbs up. The roominess is one feature my husband enjoys because he can stretch out his legs and his head doesn't hit the roof. <br><br>
