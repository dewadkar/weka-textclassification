            Okay- Okay- I was strictly a dodge pickup buyer- But I had a chance to buy my brothers 1 year old Chevy Silverado extended cab- he wanted a new 4X4. I have never regretted buying this truck-

It has 85,000 miles on it and I have had no repairs at all- It's a 96 and the paint job is still perfect. The engine still uses NO oil- Wow- I don't know what Chevy has done- but they've done it right!!!

I live in a rural area, and the pick up is perfect for these gravel roads, and it pulls my cattle trailer or the hay trailer with no effort...

As for who should buy it?? I'm a lady, 5'5&quot;, and have had some problems with my other pickups- such as seeing out the front clearly, blind spots, etc- no problem with my chevy-

I'm buying a new pickup in January (yep, keeping the old '96) and you can bet it will be a Chevy!!!<br><br>
