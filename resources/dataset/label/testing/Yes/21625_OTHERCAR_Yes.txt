             I have had a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo since 1994, when I purchased it new. I tried several other Sports Utility type vehicles, including the Range Rover Discovery and a Ford Explorer. I liked the Jeep the best for the way it handled and for its size. I needed a vehicle with 4 wheel drive and cargo space, as I would be using it off-road and in town.
 It has been reliable transportation for 6 1/2 years and has only recently needed major repairs. It has over 90,000 miles on it now and I'm seriously considering buying another Jeep in the next couple of years.
 This car has a really good turning radius and its size makes it great for parking in tight spots in a city. I haul all sorts of stuff around in it and have pulled a horse in a trailer, even though my engine is a V-6.
There have been numerous times when 4 wheel drive has gotten me out of a jam on dirt roads. The rack on top has been extremely useful:I seem to be able to carry almost anything and hold it in place with bungee cords.
 Gas mileage is reasonable and I do take care to change the oil every 3 months. My only complaint is that it is a noisy vehicle....it sounds like a truck and is noisy on the interstate. The original set of tires did not hold up well-I had several sidewall punctures before changing brands. The A/C is also beginning to fail..there's a leak which will show up when the weather warms up and I start using the AC again. All in all, I am a very happy customer.<br><br>
