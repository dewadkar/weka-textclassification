            To begin with I may be a little biased.  I am an avid VW fan.  This is definitely the ultimate car for the VW fan.  I own a 1994 SLC Corrado.  I have always wanted one of these cars for my own.  While it is not a perfect car, I feel that it is definitely the best bang for the buck at this time.  In this context, I am mostly referring to the VR6 equiped cars.  Why do I feel that this is the best car for the price?  Well, right out of the box the car is amazing.  This is like no other VW produced.  It sounds and drives like a real sports car.  Yet, it is comfortable enough to take on a long drive.  I took mine on an 11 hour trip and found it to be great.  It is also an extremely rare car that most people don't even know about.
  However, as with most sports cars there are some quirks.  The fog lights are prone to cracking and the sunroof is often a problem.  Other than that the cars are pretty solid.  This statement is quite contrary to most people who will talk about this car.  However a Corrado is like a fine woman, it needs to be taken care of and maintained.  It is not a car to beat on or neglect.  Many problems will arise with this sort of treatment.  Plus engine mods seem to be a common link to problems, even though no one seems to mention this.  Finally, many of these cars have well over 100k on the odometer.  As a result things are going to go wrong, with any car with that many miles and driven aggressively.  How about my car?  I have had a slight sunroof problem that I was able to remedy.  Other than that the car is great.  Not a single problem.  Not a single mod either.  However, the car also has 40k miles.
    My advice:  Get the newest model you can afford with the lowest mileage.  Make sure that it has been maintained well and have it checked out by a mechanic.  These are expensive cars to fix, but if one can find a great example (like mine) than I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.
