            I got rid of my Kodak DC-215 (see my review) a couple of weeks ago (I sold it on ebay for pretty good chunk of change). I have been shopping for a 2 megapixel camera until I saw G1. Basically, I like Kodak and Canon for the simple reason that they use Compact Flash and they have good names. Out of S10 and S20 I would go for S20, but the kit did not include a power adapter, spare batteries, etc. Besides, the camera does not have video and the video put is NTSC only (I travel abroad a lot and an added bonus of PAL video out is a big plus). 
So, for a couple of hundred dollars more I got G1. It is a beautiful 3 megapixel camera that is loaded with features and produces incredible pictures! I could go on and on about all the features of the camera, or I could just cut and paste manufacturer's spec page. 
What I will do is tell you the highlights why you should get this camera over all others:
1. The camera feels solid and unbreakable
2. The camera has a familiar SLR shape unlike silly looking Nikon 950 &amp;990
3. The camera accepts IBM Microdrive which can store 340 MB of data (no messing with CF cards!)
4. The camera has movie mode (AVI) that can eliminate a need for a camcorder.
5. The quality of pictures is spectacular, especially nightshots.
6. You can set ALL the functions of the camera manually which would make it even more like a SLR. Of you can turn on auto-pilot and let the camera self-adjust the parameters. Nice!
7. The battery lasts a long time and a charger is supplied (unlike on S20 and S10). The charger is 110/220 Volts.
8. The software package includes Photoshop LE!
9. The camera has both USB and SERIAL ports which many new cameras have forgotten-some of us still use computers-clunkers :(
10. The video-out is NTSC/PAL. So I can take it abroad easily.
I can go on and on. Basically, everything that I have been looking for in a digital camera is in G1. Controls are intuitive, LCD is bright and clear. This camera has probably more features that I need right now, but I am sure I will grow into them. For right now I am enjoying this fine piece of machinery.
I think Canon could have included a Microdrive with this camera. 899 is a bit too steep. By the way, I got it much cheaper with the help of www.milepoint.com at amazon.com.
