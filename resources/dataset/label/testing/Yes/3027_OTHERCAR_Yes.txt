            I have reviewed, tested and used most other high end digital cameras on on the market and without exception this is the best.  Being an avid SLR camera fanatic for many many years I was looking for a digital camera that as closely as possible mimicked the SLR type camera and this one exceeded my expectations.

Pros;
High Power 10x (relatively "fast" lens)
EXCELLENT TTL viewfinder.
Incredible high quality images.
Many Many Point and Shoot options as well as full manual.
Great body, very sturdy and feels good in hand.
Does not warm up.
Easy to use and locate functionality.
LCD Viewfinder reverses and folds into camera.
Excellent and easy to use "stich assist" mode.
Good decently long lasting battery. (Buy another spare though)

Cons;
No macro function (must purchase extra lens)
Zoom function is controlled by a dial at the end of the camera and is revered from normal SLR cameras. (takes a little getting used to)

Don't be fooled by the people who say that the 2.6MegaPixel on this camera is not enough.  You can print 8x10 and even larger with NO pixelization and could stand side by side with a shot taken from a 5MP camera and you would NEVER see a difference.  Higher MexpaPixel cameras just cost more, waste precious Flash Card space, and will NOT give you a better quality picture.

If you want the best and are willing to pay for it.  Don't look anywhere else.  This is the best.
