            Lets not dilly dally, lets get into the guts of this car.


Performance:
What else would you expect from a Honda (or Acura)?  You would expect to see quality and reliability.  The baby has it as well a a very powerful engine.  This baby has a v-tech engine in a V-6.  The amazing Acura engine manages to crank out 225 from a 3.2 v-6, absolutely amazing.  It can speed up to 60mph in a respectable 7.65 seconds making short work of even the BMW 528i.  It has an all aluminum block for better gas mileage and handling.  It has one problem though.  The engine runs so quietly that sometime you might accidentally try to start an already running engine, but whose fault is that =-).  It also has the new Acura sports shifter.  This is the most responsive sports shifter their is on the market.  It is the same design as the sports shifter on the NSX (Acura Super-car, $90,000).  What the sports shifter does is give the diver the ability to drive an automatic or a manual transmission (with no clutch).  And of course on of my favorites is the double wish bone suspension, O baby that's what I like.


Comforts:  First of all the system in the TL is rock'en.  Its an Acura/Bose Mix system with a cassette and CD player.  This sound system is one of the best standard systems you can possibly get with any car.  One of my favorite comforts is the lower lumbar support in the butt of the seat.  Very nice for long trips.  + The TL has all the comforts a luxury car should have.  A nicely rounded car and very tasteful.

THE NITT'y Gritty:
This car offers a great number of things.  It offers great reliability, excellent comforts, a powerful engine, and a lower price tag than any other car of its class.  The best thing about the TL is that EVERYTHING IS STANDERD.  That's what is misleading about the Lexus line.  They start at about 32,000.  But the prices sky rocket with the add-ons.  The TL only has one add-on, the Navigation system.  This car is a great price and fits into many peoples category of what they need for a car.  The average family man or the fresh out of college new career kid.  A perfect car brought to you by Honda (Acura).

Standard price:28,400
Fully loaded:   28,855
