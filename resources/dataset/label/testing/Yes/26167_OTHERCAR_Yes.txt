            I needed a truck to work with and be able to haul my three boys and be comfortable and nice. I purchased a 93,chevy 3500 crew-cab 4x4,with the 6.5 turbo diesel,auto trans,410 rear end. I love the ride and feel of this truck it is very solid and stable. The 4x4 option really helps since a crew-cab truck tends to be light on the back end and need the extra traction when in slick terrain. The auto transmission was a mistake to buy it has not held up well at all. I have had to replace it 3 times not designed to use as a towing truck. The engine from the factory lacks the pull power of the gas engines,but just turning up the injection pump,changing the exchaust to 3&quot; and installing a K&amp;N air filter. These few modifcations solved most of my power short falls. My truck still looks and rides like new. Most people think it's a new one they never can believe that I have 336,000+miles on it. I was raised with chevrolet and my three boys will drive them also. In fact my 93 will next year become my oldest sons truck. So I am expecting to reach 500k within the next two year that will be real exciting to me and something I will be sure to let others know about.<br><br>
