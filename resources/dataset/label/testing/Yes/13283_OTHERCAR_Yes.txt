            In 1987 my mother bought my father a car...This car was the 87 accord...12 years later, and 200,000 miles later this car is still going.  It is so rare today for someone to keep a car for more than five years or to find a car that can last past 150,000 miles.  This car has done both.  This inspired my father to buy another accord which is more luxurious than the 87 model but has the same long lasting qualities that honda puts into each one of it's cars.  No doubt the accord is a best buy.  Resell???why it will last forever, you need no other car.<br><br>
