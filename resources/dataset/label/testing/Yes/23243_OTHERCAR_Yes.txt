            I was wondering if anyone is willing to give me their 3000GT VR-4(94+)?

The Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 is the best car ever made, with the most unique styling, performance and power.  The 3000GT VR-4 is powered by a 3.0Litre 24 Valve DOHC Twin Turbo V-6 that produces 320 horsepower (300 in 1991 to 1993) and attached to a getrag 6-speed manual(5-speed in 1991 to 1993).  and has Full time All Wheel Drive along with All Wheel Steering.  Get the active-aero spoiler with is motorized, and leather/power sunroof, and you have an all season beast.

There are only a few things wrong with the VR-4,
 1. in 1999 the 3000GT model was discontinued from mitsubishi.
 2. the Stealth was discontinued in 1998(same car as 3000GT.)
 3. the car can only be modified to around 800 horsepower.
 4. the Spyder was only made for 2 years.
