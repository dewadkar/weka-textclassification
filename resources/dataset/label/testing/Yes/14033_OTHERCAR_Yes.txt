            There are really only two affordable, compact convertibles on the market, GM's J-bodies and the Mitsubishi Eclipse. I set out to buy a zippy, little drop-top last summer and realized my choices were slim. I thought Cavalier was ugly so I compared the Sunfire and the Eclipse. Here's what I found.

The rock-bottom model Eclipse was the same price as the maxed-out Sunfire. That already made a great argument for the domestic team. I figured the only fair way to compare the two was at the same price point.
They both had A/C, Power Windows/Locks, In-Dash CD, Dual Front Airbags, and Tilt Steering. A $22,000 Sunfire additionally gives you Keyless Entry, 4-speed Automatic Transmission, Power Mirrors, Alloy Wheels, Electronic Traction System, Cruise Control, and Anti-Lock Brakes. That same $22,000 at a Mitsubishi dealer makes for a pretty weak Spyder. Sunfire's 2.4L 150-horse I4 engine makes Eclipse's 2.0L 141-horse I4 look pretty weak. My friend's GS Spyder is always left in the dust.

There's also the issue of space. The Eclipse's trunk can barely fit 3 full paper grocery bags. My Sunfire's trunk is 3 times bigger. You can also forget about sitting in the back of a Spyder, unless you like sitting sideways. 

As for reliability, my friend had to take his car to the shop three times for the top leaking and once for his speakers blowing. That's pretty bad for having the upgraded Bose sound system. The problem with the top leaking seems to be a constant since I've heard it from two other Eclipse owners. I've never had a drop of water slip into my car when its raining.

The two small problems I've run into with my Sunfire is a slight vibration from the ABS during hard braking and the big hassle I had installing new speakers. I really want to make all kinds of custom modifications to my car, but the aftermarket industry doesn't seem to care about the Sunfire. Engine upgrades are very limited and exterior dress-up items are even worse. This is not a car for the hobbyist.

I would recommend a Sunfire to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced compact car, even if you don't want a convertible. It's got a unique look that you never get bored with, plenty of features for the dollar, it feels very sturdy, and really takes-off with the bigger engine. I would recommend what I did and get one a year old since they seem to lose value pretty quick. I do have to agree with Pontiac's slogan, they really are driving excitement all the way down to their cheapest model.<br><br>
