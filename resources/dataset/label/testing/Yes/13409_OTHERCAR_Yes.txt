            Chevy lovers consider the Blazer a classic.  The sexy yet masculine body design turns heads everywhere it goes and the limousine tinted rear window give this SUV a hip look.  Whether you own the two-wheel drive or four wheel drive you will not be disappointed with this beauty.

Apart from a few minor repairs my 96ï¿½ S-10 Blazer has been unbeatable for the daily commute or as my weekend warrior chariot.   I would say having to replace windshield wiper motor and a electric window motor after 74,000 plus miles is not too bad.  Even though I own the two wheel drive version my baby has taken me on some smooth interstate road trips and then handled just as well with off road conditions.  The fact that the vehicle sits up high off the ground gives it a fantastic platform.

The only thing that I would change with the Blazer design, and this may have already occurred with current models, is the back seat.  The two storage compartment on the ends of the back seats are nice but the back seat could use the space occupied by these compartments. Two adults fit comfortably in the back but three are hard to squeeze in.

Even though I purchased this vehicle when I was a bachelor, I can see a baby seat in the back and still driving in style. No mini-van for me.  I tell my friends that I am going to drive my cheery red Blazer until the wheels fall off.  Then I am going to put new wheels on and drive on!
