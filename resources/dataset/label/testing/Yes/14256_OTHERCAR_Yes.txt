            The 1997 Yukon is a little more than your average &quot;grocery-getter&quot;.  I ordered the two door model with every option, save the running boards.  At $31,000 (sticker of $36,400), the vehicle was not cheap, yet it has proven to be a wise investment.  It has proven its ability to perform as a four wheel drive in Colorado snow and Mississippi mud, and all the interstate between.
     This vehicle was offered with the 5.7 Liter Vortec V-8.  At 255 hp, this truck has little trouble pulling a trailer or passing in a tight spot.  However, at 14 mpg city, you might want to keep an eye out for the next gas station.  If you want fuel economy... drive a 4 cylinder.  This engine has torque too!  I have pulled boats through the Ozark mountains with no trouble.
     The available gearing (3.73 or 3.42) gives the buyer options to control the gas mileage.  I have the 3.73 rear axle ratio and consequently build up more rpm's at the same speed as the 3.42.  However, this does have it's advantages, especially for those who pull a trailer.  If you drive down the highway, don't get off the pavement, or never trailer anything, go for the 3.42 rear end.  There is also an available auto locker in the rear end (makes both rear wheels turn when 4 wheel drive is engaged), giving extra traction.  Beware:  if you haven't driven a vehicle with lockers on snow, ice, or mud, be ready for the rear end to swing out a little bit.  I became accustomed to this with a little practice.
     The ride is a little rough, but if you want a ride like a car, buy a two wheel drive four door.  Off road, the truck handles very well.  On the interstate, the vehicle is stable at 75 mph.  I don't hesitate to drive anywhere in this rig.
     The interior is spacious and functional.  The SL model is the base model with vinyl everything.  SLE is cloth.  SLT is the leather package.  I have the latter and after almost 3 and a half years, it still looks great.  Cons on the inside...Driver's seats in both Chevy and GMC vehicles (driver's side) &quot;pop&quot; on acceleration from a stop.  The recirculation fan motor is noisy (squeaky after about 6 months).  That's about all I have experienced.
   Under the vehicle...Skid plates and Bilstein shocks with the Z-71 offroad package (also includes polyurethane bushings on all the arms, etc, instead of rubber).  30 gallon gas tank is available if you put the tire on the inside, otherwise it's only 18 gallons, but you get more 
cargo room...  Dual exhaust back to the muffler, so if you want twin pipes, there is a lot less &quot;plumbing&quot; to do.  Cons underneath... The drive line will develop a &quot;clunk&quot; at about 30,000 miles.  When you accelerate from a stop, listen for a &quot;clank&quot;.  This sound is due to worn splines on the driveshaft, and according to GM it is an &quot;engineering issue&quot; that does not damage the driveline or the rest of the vehicle.  However, it is annoying.  Also, there are reports of other &quot;clunks&quot; when the vehicle is initially put into gear.  Take the truck to your GM dealer and they will change the Transfer Case fluid, the sound disappears...
     Finally, I believe the truck to be very safe.  I was hit by a pickup that was traveling around 30 mph.  It struck the driver's door.  I was unharmed and the truck pulled through too!  With a new door and rear quarter panel, she was as good as new (with NO frame damage).  I think I'll drive a GMC forever...
