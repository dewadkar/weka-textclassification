            I have a 1993 Legacy, and it has been the best. My husband has already been through 3 cars and I've had the Legacy all along. I brought it from Texas to Virginia and then to North Carolina. It has quite a bit of mileage on it now, but it keeps running beautifully.

We have had to keep the regular upkeep on it, such as oil changes, tires and hoses. But no major problems with this car. I loved the color it came in, teal green. Even though the paint is chipped in some places and there are dings in the doors, I love my little car.

One of my favorite things is the shape of the sedan and the comfort inside. The material on the seats has held up well, considering all the kids I have carried around. (not mine, but others) We have one child and it's pretty easy getting her in and out of this car. If you think because you have children you need a mini-van then you should try one of these cars out first. The only thing is that if you have a large family, this car only seats 5 and 4 comfortably. With a car seat, definitely only four can seat well and it is somewhat uncomfortable. But overall, for us, it is great!

The gas mileage has been incredible. We travel from North Carolina to Virginia a lot and we've always had the best gas mileage. With the prices of gas now a days, good gas mileage is a definite plus.<br><br>
