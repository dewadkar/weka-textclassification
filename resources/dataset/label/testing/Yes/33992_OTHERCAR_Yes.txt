            Say goodbye to the old S-10 Blazer based Bravada.  General Motors is replacing their mid size SUVs with a new, bigger, and better version.  The 2002 Bravada is sure to win some hearts and minds with its subtle good looks and Cadillac like interior.  There are three mid size SUVs for sale from General Motors, and although they are similar, the Bravada stands a little taller in a crowd.  

Oldsmobiles are probably one of the best buys on the new car market right now.  The announcement that Oldsmobile will no longer exist in about five years has caused some to steer clear of  these cars.  The truth is, dealers want to sell Oldsmobiles, so a bargain should be easier to strike.  Additionally, General Motors is seeking to put buyers minds at ease by offering a 5 year / 60,000 mile warranty on all new Oldsmobile cars and trucks, it all adds up to a great deal for the consumer.  While it�s true the Bravada is essentially the same vehicle as the Chevy TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy (TrailBlazer lacks rear air suspension and some luxury items), the Oldsmobile has a much better warranty. Considering that the pricing is very similar  on all three of these GM SUVs, the Olds is the clear choice of the three � the Envoy and TrailBlazer offer only a typically pathetic 3/36 warranty. Also, the Bravada is the best looking SUV of the three.

The 2002 Bravada is smoother and quieter than any other sport utility vehicle in its class.  It is this car like quality that makes such an impression when driving the Bravada.  The car like ride is combined with an equally smooth, 4.2 liter, inline six cylinder engine that cranks out an impressive 270 hp. 270 is more horsepower than even the Explorer makes with its optional V8.  The Bravada delivers its power in such a refined manner you�d barely suspect that this is a truck based SUV.  On the road the Bravada feels stable and sure-footed, lacking the �tippy� feeling of other truck like vehicles. Open highway is especially pleasant in the Bravada. The new Bravada lacks the busy feeling of the old when cruising at highway speeds.  When driving with the all-wheel drive system on, there is a very vague, jerky feeling when driving in stop and go traffic.  The all-wheel drive also causes the fuel economy to drop a bit.

The interior of the new Bravada is quite luxurious.  Power, leather seats are comfortable and adjust in so many different ways, only the crankiest of drivers would find reason to complain. Rear seats are also comfortable, but very large passengers may fit the back seat a tight squeeze. Dual zone climate control is useful when traveling with the family, the rear seat passenger can also control the temperature independent of the separate driver and passenger controls up front.  The Bravada even has a built in air-compressor in the rear cargo area which is ideal for blowing up balls, rafts or even flat tires � especially handy when venturing far from civilization. The only thing lacking inside the Bravada is a 3rd row seat. Oldsmobile has said one will be available in the near future. This alone will cause some to choose the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer over the GM trio Bravada/TrailBlazer/Envoy.  Explorer/Mountaineer and The Dodge Durango have seating for up to 7, while the Bravada and its twins make due with seating for 5.  

Overall, the new, 2002 Bravada is a great looking SUV that doesn�t force its owner to choose between comfort and utility.  The Bravada delivers both with a quiet confidence usually found only in luxury cars costing much more. The 2002 Bravada is simply an excellent sport utility vehicle, it  has the comfort, convenience, style and sheer utility found on the larger Chevy Tahoe without the overall exterior size.  This is one of the most car-like SUVs on the market.
