            In 1999 I decided to buy a 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe because I wanted the best of &quot;both worlds&quot;- the best attributes of a luxury car with the options and benefits of owning a truck. I had been very disappointed by my test drive experiences with the Ford Expedition and the Ford explorer.

My initial test drive with the Tahoe was great! I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort and convenience the Tahoe offered. After driving the Tahoe for over a year now, I still have the same opinion. The seats are very comfortable, the vehicle handles very well(in 2WD as well as 4WD). I like everything from the convenience of the folding down back seat for cargo room to the configuration of the instrument panels. 

I do wish the vehicle was equipped with an optional on/off switch for the passenger side airbag so my daughter(who weighs only 73lbs) could ride in the front seat when I need to haul something in the cargo area. The only service required has been routine maintenance: oil changes, brakes, wiper blades,etc. My gas mileage is about 18-20 mpg, not really bad for a large vehicle. 

This is a great, safe vehicle for most anyone. Someone who requires high fuel economy and does not need to carry around passengers or equipment would not be well suited for the Tahoe. Being a single mom, I really appreciate the comfort, convenience and independence the Tahoe gives me!<br><br>
