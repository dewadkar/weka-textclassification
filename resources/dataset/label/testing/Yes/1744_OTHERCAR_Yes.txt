            I've always loved Camaros. My parents bought me a new '95 Camaro when I turned 16. I drove it until my husband and I got pregnant. I never had any problems with it. It was VERY reliable. We traded it in for a minivan, which I quickly became very unhappy with. So, we shopped for another car for me a few months later. My experience with my Camaro was so great, we looked at nothing but Camaros and Firebirds.(Because they're basically the same car.) This time I got a V8. A '95 Firebird Formula with an LT1, leather interior, t-tops, power everything. When we bought it, it had 118,000 miles on it, and soon died on us. Our mechanic said whoever owned it before drove it really, really hard. So, he rebuilt it, and it drives like a brand-new car! Everything electronically works fine, and I've had no other problems.
About performance, it's incredible. People who are true muscle car fans will appreciate it! It's very sporty, but safer than other little sports cars because it's bigger and heavier. If I get hit by a road-hogging SUV, I'll probably have some body work to do, but walk away. If one of those little import wanna-bes gets hit by such a monster, it would be demolished.
About space, no, there is not very much. Not a family car, but if I have to take the kids(1 and 2-year olds) to the store or something, and daddy isn't home with the van, they fit fine in the back seats, car seats and all. It really isn't that big of a deal. However, the rear-facing infant seats will NOT fit in. (I should know, I drove the camaro when I had my first kid.)
About visibility, you get used to it. Like any other car, you learn how far out you stick. As for the two blind spots behind the front seats, use your mirrors people! It's safer to use your mirrors correctly than to turn your head around to look anyway. I can see all around my car with my mirrors.
People who should buy this car: Those capable of handling the power and driving it safely; people looking for a fun ride; and people who are in the market for a sports car.(Don't bother looking here if you're looking for a family car.)
People who should not buy this car: Teenagers are fine in the V6 until they learn how to rein-in a 285hp V8 (the damage they do to a V6 is cheaper to repair too); people looking for a car to fit the babies in or grocery shop in; and people looking for a vehicle that requires no skill to drive.
