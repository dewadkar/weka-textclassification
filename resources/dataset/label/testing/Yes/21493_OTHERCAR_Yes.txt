            I have a black 97 GP SE 3800.  It came with a dealer installed sun roof and shiny metal rims.  The sun roof has been great, it's from Holland called Hollandia.  BUT, the combination of black color and dark interior and sun roof, really make the car hot, the a/c has a tough time keeping up.  BUT, a lot of people turn their heads to see me coming / going.

The ride is tremendous: sporty/stiff yet soft, except the handling on curves is not good.  I could go around curves in my Saturan SL2 faster than this car.  The mileage is about as good as the Saturn.  It's around 27 mpg at 65mph.  It does run hot at idle, but runs pretty cool at 65mph.  The transmission is pretty smooth.  

The interior remains solid (quiet) at 75,000 miles.  The seats don't have a lot of cushioning, but enough for me (I am light weight).

I did have someone tap me in the rear end at about 5 mph, with only minor scratches on the bumper.

I have had several problems under the hood:

1)  fly wheel cover chattering, replaced two times.  Tightened one last time by dealer and given up after that.

2)  Right front fog light burned out two times, replaced by dealer two times.  I replaced it once and gave up after that.

3)  The battery clamps corroded bad enough the car would not start one day.  Before the failure, I could literally see the dash board lights dimming and reglowing normal slightly while idling.  After cleaning and re-tightening the cables, it's been ok.

4)  I got a flat once and the flat tire sensor had to be replaced.  The dealership replaced it at no charge.

All of the above happened under 30,000 miles.

4)  The water pump started seizing at 35,000 miles (squeeling).  At 73,000 it started leaking and squeeling really bad even at 65 mph.

5) There is a recall for the wiper motor or so.  I haven't had this checked out yet.

I had some bad luck and shredded a tire, so I ended up getting a new set, the ride is definitely more solid with new tires.

I did have to add a lot of water/coolant to the radiator around 60,000 miles.
