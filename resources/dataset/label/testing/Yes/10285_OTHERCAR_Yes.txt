            I am a teenager who needed a reliable car for my daily 30 mile round trips to school everyday.  The purpose of buying this car was for it to last, and hopefully get me through college.  I bought my USED 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE a year ago with around 45,000 miles on it.  The car was an automatic (a must for me) with cruise control, 4 door, power locks and windows, and a/c.  For a teenager who had just got her license it was a nice car.  After a year I have not had any major problems with the car.  I did have to get my starter replaced a couple months ago, and my power locks for awhile went out on me.  I didn't have have to get my power locks fixed because some how they are working again (i think something got jiggled).  I drive a lot on the interstate and get fairly good gas mileage.  I can anywhere from 300 miles to 330 miles per tank.  The seats in the back fold down for extra space and to have easy access to what is in the trunk.  

The Nissan Sentra is fairly small.  I definitely would not recommend it for long trips with a lot of people.  For anyone sitting in the back the leg space is cramped.  The car is definitely suited for 1 or 2 people, although it seats 5.

I have had no problems with the heating or air conditioning.  Easy and well lit dials to work with while driving.  I use my radio/stereo constantly and have had no problems.  I actually use my portable CD, using the tape deck and the cigarette lighter.  No problems.  There are 2 cup holders but it is a slide-out cup holder.  So if you are using the cup holders they block the clock and the stereo controls.

The ride is fairly smooth and quiet so I have no complaints when it comes to that.  Overall my 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE has proven to be a reliable, good first car.  <br><br>
