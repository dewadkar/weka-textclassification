            I purchased my new 2000 Camry nearly 2 months ago and I Love it so Much! It is the best car I have ever owned!! With 2 children under 3 I needed something that was going to have plenty of room and and still be safe. The new 2000 Toyota Camry gave us just that. It comes fully equipped with child saftey locks on both rear doors so no matter how hard my children try they cannot get out with out an adult opening the doors from the outside.

The Camry has so many features that I just love. In the rear there is TONS of leg room even with both seats pushed as far back as they will go. So the kids have plenty of leg room being in their car seats and are not cramped at all. There is also more than enough room for a full grown adult to ride in between the carseats w/ full comfort. For times when we go out just &quot;adults&quot; , there is a  arm rest that pulls down in between the seats in the back. A nice feature to help you &quot;relax&quot;. There are 2 rear cup holders as well that hide easily. 

The front of the car is just as comfortable if not more than the back. My husband is 6 ' 4&quot; and fits perfectly into the drivers seat and has added room in the passangers seat. There is a nice storage compartment in the center of the seat that holds numerous amounts of things. The Camry CE also comes factory with a CD player/cassette. This was one of the best features by far for me. There are dual air bags as well for added protection. 

Something I found very nice about the Camry's is every single window/door etc. every major piece of the car has the VIN # etched on it in case of a theft. I know my car will be found. Also the paint is protected by a chemical called TOYOGAURD. This helps keep the exterior looking good through all kinds of weather. 

The car is backed with a 5 year warranty , but I don't think we will be having any problems out of this smooth ride. I would never hesitate to take the Camry on a long trip as it is the quitest , smoothest car I have ever ridden in. When my husband drives it to work he leaves before my son is awake in the morning. Well my sons room is right next to the drive way. We are able to rest assured that when he cranks the Camry in the mornings my son will not be awoken by it as it is so quiet.

I honestly don't think I will buy another car unless it is a Camry. It has been rated #1 by every report I have read and I do believe it!! I believe it should be and always will be the #1 Car for families!!<br><br>
