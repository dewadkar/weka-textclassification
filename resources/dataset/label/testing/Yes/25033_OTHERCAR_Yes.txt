            I purchased my 1990 Plymouth Voyager several months ago to use for work. It had 142,000 miles on it when I bought it. I called the Crysler recall 800 # to make sure everything was updated. I then spent about $150.00 in tune-up parts. I highly recommend replacing the following:

Spark plugs
Distributor Cap
Rotor
Plug Wires
Fuel Filter
Vent Case Filter
Air Filter
PCV Valve

This 3.0 liter motor tends to blow white smoke out of the tail pipe after it hits higher mileage (not abnormal). After I did the tune-up, the van started hitting about 19 miles to the gallon (city). That's pretty good for a 3.0 liter engine with over 140,000 miles. I found the original owners manual in the storage bin under the passenger seat along with some papers that the original (one owner) kept. They changed the oil every 3,000 miles (rule of thumb for engine longevity), had the front end aligned at 50,000 miles, changed the transmission fluid, etc. You name it and they did it. I was blessed to find a van in this condition. The original burgundy paint still shines after a nice coat of polish. The interior is not faded, the seats have minor rips, and the head-liner needs to be fixed. Aside from some minor, normal wear and tear issues, this Voyager gets me to work and back. I pulled out the rear seat and tossed an over sized couch in there like it were a soccer ball. This van has serious room. It will come in handy the next time I purchase something large that the average trunk would choke on.
