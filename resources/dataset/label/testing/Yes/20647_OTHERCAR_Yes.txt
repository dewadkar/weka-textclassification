            Test drove the A6 2.7t and that was it. This is clearly the best bang for the buck out there. Even w/o Quattro this would be an excellent car. With the Quattro system there are no 4 door sedan equals. (case closed) Anyone who wants looks, quality, performance and safety should consider this great car. The A6 is very quiet and sure footed to drive and the power is always ready when and if you need it. Our other car is a Mazda Protege' a good kick around car. Yesterday my wife was going out in the rain and I told her to take the A6. When she came home I asked her how it handled in the rain. Her answer was like it was dry. That is something BMW &amp; Mercedes can't talk about even with a traction control system. All that system does is break a slipping wheel, the Quattro system directs power to the best and other turning wheels keeping a balance in the car. Another real benefit of this car is the gas mileage. Around town a realistic 15-18 and mid to high 20's on the road. Those figures blow away even v-6 sport uts. I bought this car because I was tired of inadequate power and reliability. This gives you all that and so much more. I have every intention of buying this car when the lease runs out in 38 months. Consider this vehicle it is really great!<br><br>
