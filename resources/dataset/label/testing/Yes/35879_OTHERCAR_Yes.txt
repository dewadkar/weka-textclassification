            I never intended to become a &quot;SUV owner.&quot;  In fact, I find the current crop of luxury SUVs unappealing, from both an aesthetic and practical standpoint. If I absolutely needed 4-wheel drive for adverse road conditions or off-road fun, would I really want to be driving a $40,000 SUV and trashing its leather-wrapped interior with mud and dirt?  On the other hand, if I wanted real ride comfort and luxury, wouldn't I be better off with a luxury car?  Thus my feeling that the current crop of mega-buck SUVs are truly vehicles in search of a cause.

While looking for a much-needed addition to the &quot;family fleet&quot; (too many drivers, not enough cars), we came across a 1996 Cherokee Sport in pristine condition.  With only 63k on its odometer and an attractive asking price, I was tempted to make the purchase, even though a SUV was not on the menu. I went home and spent some time at this site to see what others thought of the Jeep. Some claim the Jeep Cherokee is not as luxurious as the new breed of SUV, to which I entirely agree. Others dismiss the Cherokee's styling as &quot;dated,&quot; to which I also agree. No one finds its seating (especially the back) overly comfortable. However, no one finds fault with the Cherokee's mechanical durability or its off-road prowess, which comes as no surprise. 

Temptation got the best of me and the red Cherokee is now parked in our driveway.  It was indeed those utilitarian qualities that endeared it and convinced me to make the purchase. As I quickly discovered, the Cherokee delivers dependable all-terrain capability with decent ride comfort, and fuel economy that is as good or better than most of it's more expensive competition. All without any snobby pretenses... 

Our Jeep Cherokee has thus far fulfilled its mission splendidly.  Its spacious cargo area is ideal for trips to the grocery store or gardening center.  Winter travel will be far less stressful with its excellent 4-wheel drive system and plentiful ground clearance.  If we need to comfortably seat 4 adults, we take the car.  With its low miles (by Jeep standards) and low purchase price (1/5 the price of a new luxury-SUV, no second mortgage required), I know I have made a wise investment.

Anyone interested in purchasing a practical 4-wheel drive SUV (without breaking the bank) should look for a used Jeep Cherokee. While it may not be ideal as the primary family car, it's fine for short road trips or daily commuting in regions where severe winter weather is a threat. It's perfectly suited for those who enjoy off-road leisure. Its drive train durability and effectiveness is legendary.

While the occupants of the mega-buck, leather-lined, maxed-out SUVs may look down their noses at our Cherokee, I happily go about my business (on road and off), smiling all the way to the bank.
