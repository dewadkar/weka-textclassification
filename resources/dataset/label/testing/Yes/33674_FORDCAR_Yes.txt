            I had always liked Escorts for their low prices and reliability and I finally found one when I was car shopping this fall. I bought a 1998 Ford Escort SE and love driving it. It's fun, has lots of features that belong in more expensive cars. I've gotten lots of compliments from friends who can't believe it's an Escort since my car looks sleek and sporty. The gas mileage has been terrific and the car has been very comfortable for me, since I'm 5'2&quot;.  I can't say that my husband feels the same way:  he describes driving it as being in &quot;tin can.&quot; Everything feels small to him, and that's probably true if you're a big guy. I can fit all four of my kids comfortably in my Escort and everyone enjoys the ride. For busy moms, it's great to have fold-down rear seats for grocery shopping without being stuck with a station wagon. When it's food shopping day, my car can handle all the groceries my family requires. The A/C and heating controls are comfortable and easy to work and the car manual is one of the easiest I've ever read. Other than the limited space for drivers larger than myself, another down side would have to be a sometimes spotty performance for the AM/FM radio. Certain stations that come in fine in our 12-year-old second car are staticky in the Escort. Overall, this is a great car for Moms who require great mileage, a comfortable ride at a good price and flexibility with space in the back.<br><br>
