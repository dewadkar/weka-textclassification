               The 2001 Mazda Tribute 2WD V6-LE is a very stylish SUV. I enjoy the two-toned paint choices. The performance of mine has been outstanding with the 3.0 liter V-6 engine. Gas mileage has been less than satisfactory at 17-20 MPG combined. Road noise is above average and often the radio has to be turned quite loudly to cover the noise. The gear shift handle sticks out over the radio and interferes with the ability to adjust the volume of the radio.
    The CD changer is in the dash and allows for easy ability to load 6 CD's into the front of the radio. It is the finest car stereo I have ever owned!! 
     
    I have owned three Mazda pick-ups in the past and appreciate the engineering and performance of its products. I look forward to driving and enjoying my Tribute!!
