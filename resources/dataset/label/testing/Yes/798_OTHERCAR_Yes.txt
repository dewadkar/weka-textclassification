            <b>Introduction</b>

I found myself in the market for a car earlier this year.  I had been driving a 1992 Toyota Corolla since my senior year in high school, and had been looking to "upgrade," not because the car was dying... it wasn't.  It was still running well, but I wanted a car that could easily handle the Grapevine along I-5.

I had a list of potential cars: a VW Passat, a Nissan Maxima, a Honda Accord, a Toyota Camry, and a Toyota (Camry) Solara, and (for kicks) a Toyota Celica.  All had strong engines, but I could only buy one.

So why the Solara?  Here are a myriad of reasons: I axed the Maxima because it is the current dream car of a friend, axed the Accord because I didn't like how the back-end of the coupe looked, and said sayonara to the Celica because it was a bit on the small side.

For practical purposes, the Solara won it for me because of its Toyota heritage, and personally I think it looks better than a Passat or a Camry.

<b>The Opinion</b>

Toyota is a reputable company.  The automobiles that they manufacture are high in quality, and are priced on the low side.  If it weren't for the "driving through the mountains" bit, I'd still be driving my Corolla.

The Solara is a unique creature.  It was designed in Newport Beach, CA, and is manufactured in Canada.  I believe that it is only marketed to North America, which may explain its absense from Gran Turismo 3.  :-)

If you look at the Solara, you can't help but marvel at its looks.  You may hear opinions that it is an Acura TL knockoff.  Whatever!  I think it looks tons better than the Acura.

You can form your own opinion on the exterior, so let me dwell a little bit on the innards.  The SLE (which is what I bought) comes with leather seating.  It is sa-mooth!  I've even had someone say that it feels better than the leather interior that you will find in a Mercedes-Benz.

There is a lot of interior room too.  I was able to sit in the back seat comfortably.  (although if you have a big, tall person sitting in front, the back seat comfort factor may go down)  Entry to the back seat is limited on the driver side, as the seat may only be moved electronically.  But on the passenger side, the seat is moved via the good ol' seat latchs on the side and back.

The audio system is superb.  I opted to get the In-dash CD changer with mine.  6 CDs of your choosing is so much better than listening to bad radio.  The only thing that could be wrong with the audio is that it leans a bit toward the bassy side.

The button placement is also good.  You may have read an epinion that mentions that the frequency control knob is too far to the right (i.e., out of reach).  They have a pair of buttons on the left side of the radio that lets you surf established stations so you don't have to go by every tenth of a frequency.

I don't like to punish cars (especially those that I own!) so I cannot say how the Solara handles in like a cone slalom, but for regular driving and for highway driving the Solara is a blast to drive.  For highway driving, not all the sound is kept out, but it is sooo much better than say how a Corolla would do.  And the V6 engine comes in handy when you need to pass a car, and the lane to the left is the speed lane.  The engine won't punk out when it comes to reasonable uphills too (unfortunately, no car will drive up a wall).

V6 engines aren't the best at fuel efficiency, but the Solara comes with a tachometer so that you can monitor your rpms to smoothly accelerate without wasting gas.  (but you may want to waste gas, so whatever)

Well, that's it.  I've had my Solara for some time now, so I'm over the new buyer's bliss.  Still, I am happy with my purchase... and isn't that the only thing that matters?

Oh, I should explain my cons for this car.  They aren't big cons... more like differences between the Corolla that I had, and the Solara that I have now.  The complaint about the steering column perhaps being too big is one of the first things that I noticed when I stepped into the Solara.  When I brake, sometimes I like to move my entire leg to line it up with the brake pedal.  When I do that, my knee will sometimes hit the steering column.  Your knee may not do this... so this will be inconsequential for you.

And for the doors not automatically locking?  My mom's Camry (year 1992) doors lock when she starts her engine.  This may happen because of the alarm she installed on her car.  I don't know for sure though.  (I wish my Solara did that though!)

Oh, btw, if you roll any convertible, you have more to worry about than a windshield collapsing.  And if you roll any vehicle, you're dad will be sooo angry when he finds out.  :-)
