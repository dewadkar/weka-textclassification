            We bought our '95 Saturn SL1 in July of 1995, our first brand new car.  The whole buying experience was WONDERFUL &amp; uncomplicated.  I always liked the look (and still prefer the pre-1996 look) of the Saturn &amp; since we'd only been hearing good things about Saturns on performance tests, etc, we thought we'd give it a try -- besides, they sold at a price we could afford!  
We took our Saturn to Germany for a 3 year tour there w/ the Army.  Once there we wished we would have shelled out the extra bucks for the higher power engine &amp; smoother ride of the SL2 since Autobahn driving is demanding -- but overall, our little SL1 kept the pace pretty well.  On most long trips our average speed was about 85mph.  We brought our Saturn back to the States in January of 1999 with no major problems
Still driving it, still loving it at 75,000+ miles!  Now that it's paid for we plan on driving it to 200,000 miles -- and then trading it in for another SATURN! Maybe going for the LS!?!?!  :) <br><br>
