            As a sort of 16th birthday present, in the Fall of '96 I got a blue 4 door Chevy Cavalier.  My parents got it with about 4,000 miles on it at a repossession lot.  A very good deal.  I think they paid around 12,000 for it at that time.

This car has been great for me.  I used it all through high school and never had any sort of trouble at all with it.  Nothing has ever had to be done to it other than routine maintenance.  Never had any strange rattles or noises that I had to worry about and have fixed, like is common with many cars.

Now I have it at college with me (and am paying rent to my parents for it, mind you)which I must drive 6 hours away to get to.  I've driven as far as 12 hours away with it and have never felt uncomfortable or afraid that it wouldn't get me there.  It's a very dependable car.

It handles really well and is a great car to zip along in.  It's got a great turning radius and is really fun to drive.  Small cars always seem to be a bit more &quot;cheery&quot; and fun to drive.  Big SUVs and such are &quot;dominating&quot; and huge and all, but they're not as much fun to fly along narrow country roads in!

It's not too flashy of a car, but I find it to be fairly sleek.  I'm a big fan of roundish cars rather than boxy ones, and the Cavalier definitely makes the cut.  The interior could be a little bit more elegant.  There aren't too many nifty gadgets up front to play with and the only gauges are for gas, temperature and speed.  It's always fun to drive a car that has a million of those things.  Kinda like an airplane :) Another downside that fits in with that is that there is no trip mileage counter thingy.  It only has an odometer in it that's permanent, so if you want to figure out how far something is you have to be able to subtract, and its not always easy to remember what number you started at.

The air conditioning works fairly well.  It cools when you're hot and heats when you're cold.  Not as high-tech as a lot of the new cars though.  You can't set the exact temperature that you want the car to be, you have to adjust it yourself.

I had a CD player put in while keeping the same speakers that came with the car and have been very impressed w/the durability of the sound system.  For them being standard on the car they're a great deal and have a super sound. I know I could get better, but I'm very happy with the ones that came in it.

As a finishing touch and personalization, as I think all cars should have, I have a vanity plate. It reads JUMPN BN.  See if you can figure it out!  I think the name suits my car, and probably my personality.  The Cavalier is a dependable, sturdy car that I haven't had any problems with, yet it is still fun.  Tell me, how can you beat that?
