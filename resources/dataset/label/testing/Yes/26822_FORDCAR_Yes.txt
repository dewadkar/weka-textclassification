            I have a bit more time to write, look below for a bit more. First and foremost, still.....I have to say:
This is for all of you people who write negative comments about this vehicle, even when you don't own them. If you don't like it....DON'T BUY IT! Why spend the money just so you can complain on a website about how much you hate your SUV, it's your own fault! And if you don't own it, don't get on here and moan about everything you find wrong with it, because you will give prospective buyers a negative thought on a vehicle that really should be looked into. Let the people who actually drive them every day and pay for them write about them. I'm NOT saying everyone should love this truck, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I can imagine some people don't like driving this vehicle, more so maybe women. This is my mom's vehicle and she drives it everyday. She wants to get something even bigger, maybe she's crazy...I've wondered that myself. But the bottom line is...yeah it's big, maybe too big, but it gets attention. But if it's too big for you, I will stress again, DON'T TRY TO DRIVE IT! Find something smaller. I personally find the only difficulty I have driving this vehicle is backing up which takes more alertness and concentration, and I've been driving for less than a year! It's fine to drive in the city, a little harder yes...but you should just know that when you purchase one.

Aight now to the truck. We've had it almost three years, and will say goodbye to it in October of 2002. It's been a very good vehicle to us. After over 30,000 miles, we have had no trouble at all. A few recalls or very minor repairs done, but that's it. From the best of my knowledge the only repairs we've had on this were a burnt light on the running board and the 4X4 transfer case looked at (but nothing was wrong). If I happen to find out anything else had to be done I'll be sure to put it on here.

Features of the "beast": Eddie Bauer package, 5.4L Triton V8 engine, leather seats, heated front seats, electronic climate control, cruise, tilt, power everything (windows, locks, mirrors, driver's seat), rear defogger, leather wrapped steering wheel, MACH stereo (4 premium speakers & subwoofer) w/ 6 CD changer and tape, keyless entry with anti-theft system and outside driver number pad for entry, third seat, rear radio and climate controls, two tone paint/cladding, signal mirrors (extra turn signal built into mirror), lighted running boards, foglights, power rear quarter panel vents, outside temp display, overhead console w/ fuel information, 17" rims, and more I'm sure I can't think of. Don't less the price scare you either, you can get them for cheaper than the sticker a lot of the time.

As for how we've liked the biggest vehicle we've ever owned, we've been quite satisfied owners. It rides nice, despite the "yaw" when turning corners fast. (We expected that with such a big vehicle). The third seat has come in handy A LOT (especially toting all my friends around), except our only gripe is getting back there and that the seat is heavy to try to take out. It doesn't fold flat and there's not a lot of room behind it, but oh well. The engine is quite peppy and muscular, even though in 1999 they reduced the horsepower from 260 to 235, this is still quite quick for a 3 ton truck. Engine noise inside is a little high when getting up to speed, but I enjoy hearing the rumble of the big V8. Ground clearance is a bit high but with all the access handles even my Grandmother can still make it inside. The black glossy paint w/ tan fender accents really makes the truck look nice, along with the tan leather matching interior. The interior is somewhat contemporary (a bit plane jane, but not ugly), but modern at the same time. There's plenty of storage pockets and compartments, and plenty of power points for everyone to power their gadgets. Instrumentation is great, with bright green on everything making things easy to read.

Oh, and one of the most important things of course...the stereo! It sounds quite good for only having 4 speakers, the subwoofer really kicks out the bass. I've had it all the way up on many occasions and the sound distortion is very low. Also at lower volume and around half there is A LOT of bass that after a while even makes my VERY tolerant head begin to ache a bit.

Well, I'll write a bit more when I'm not so tired and have more time, there's some more for you to ponder.

Thanks for reading!
