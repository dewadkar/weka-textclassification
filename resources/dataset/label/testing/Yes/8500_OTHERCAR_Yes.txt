            I've read a lot of the reviews for this camera and have to agree on what most consider its strong points and also its weakness.

If you are new to the Digital camera world as I was then you know how confusing it can be when sifting through the sea of models available. Not only do you have to learn about pixels and media cards, but you really need to figure out what you will use the camera for to really narrow down your search for the right product

To cut to the chase, and to be very non-technical; the Fuji FinePix 2600 is a great point and shoot camera with some good features. A 3x optical zoom, lens cover,  included battery charger with two AA rechargeable batteries, and a 16MB smartmedia card make for a good package for your first camera. With 2.0 Megapixels, this camera produces high quality pictures and can do so with mostly automatic settings leaving you to concentrate on picture taking. You can use this camera as a web cam, record a short soundless video and if so inclined, you may also manually adjust some of the settings. For me I have found it best to put it on auto and let the camera do what it does best, take great pictures. The 1.8"LCD screen is a little larger than some, it is easy to zoom in to see the picture you have taken, you can also see up to nine pictures at one time.

Reading the owners manual and software manual I was very impressed at how easy it was to install the software and to download pictures to my PC via USB.Fuji has a pretty good website if you have questions and need support. One detail about the company that some may not know and a point that set it apart from all the other cameras in this price range is that Fuji makes many of the lenses used in the motion picture industry and their cameras as a whole get very positive reviews, especially for the extras they throw in.

The only negative aspect to this product is that some camera buffs may want more manual control over the settings. Also, the construction of the camera is not offensive, rather very acceptable as long as you don't expect the case to be metal. Many cameras in this beginners range are made of plastic, I never get the impression the camera will not hold up or will break. The compartment for the media card and batteries is a little cheaply made but still not a major drawback. This little gem is small enough to put in your shirt or jacket pocket, best of all, you can be using it out of the box as soon as you read a few tips and install a set of fully charged batteries. The shutter lag is a little distracting but still, I have to say the overall package is very well done and definitely worth the cost which is usually less expensive than other models in this 2.0mega pixel range.
