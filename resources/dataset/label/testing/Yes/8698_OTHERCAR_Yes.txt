            Wow, Honda has finally made a very attractive coupe. The Accord coupe is very stylish, new, and comes in great colors. I love how the coupe handles on the road, I can honestly say that it has a lot of power and can take down most cars of it's size and class. The one part about this car that I don't like is the price. If' i'm gunna spend 23,000 bucks on a coupe, Why would I spend it on a Honda Coupe? The truth is, other small cars in it's class, Camry, Volvo S40, etc, are the same style, with being in that same price range, and they're in fact better cars. What is great about this car is the sound system. The 6 cd changer has 200 watts, plus speakers all around. The car is virtually quiet, and it handles like a dream. I really do like it, but not the price. <br><br>
