            I've been at several weddings and I have been asked by complete strangers about the camera! They all gush at how small it is and how it can can't be a digital camera! I would rate this just below a puppy and a newborn baby in having people come up to you just to see it.

I upgraded to this from the older S-100 model for the video capability. I thought this was a must have, but in reality I don't use the feature as much as I thought. Mostly because you have a choice of three settings LARGE, medium, and tiny. As the size of the video your capturing increases, the length of the video you can capture decreases. So at its largest video size (my favorite) you can only really capture 7-10 seconds of video. Not really much at all.... But nice to have nonetheless. Which brings me to my favorite thing about this camera!

   Hey let's face it size matters!!! All my digital camcorder friends scoff at paying so much for a digital camera when for another 100.00 you can get a video camera that also can take still photos. Sure you can and they have a valid point, but then I have to carry another battery pack, and maybe a spare tape. I don't care how small those cameras are becoming you still can't take them and toss them into your pocket or hang them around your neck (with an optional metal chain).  With this camera I can still be spontaneous and just snap a few picks whenever I want.

Until someone makes a smaller one I am very happy with my S-110 --thank you very much!
