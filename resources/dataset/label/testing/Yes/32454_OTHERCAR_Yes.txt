            I recently purchased a 1984 Nissan 300ZX Turbo. What can I say, I have a soft spot for Nissans (ever since my Datsun 510 wagon threw a rod I've really missed having a project car), and I LOVE turbocharging or anything to do with forced induction, so I snapped it up right away. Here, then, is my first impression and overall knowledge of the car, for your benefit;

The 300ZX is basically the same design as the previous Z-cars except for minor differences to the powertrain and chassis/body. It uses a steel unit body construction and rubber mounted crossmembers for structural rigidity, as well as to isolate the driver and passengers from drivetrain vibrations. The 300ZX has an independent rear suspension system, which consists of two semi-trailing arms suspended by coil springs and MacPherson strut shock absorbers. The wheels are driven by halfshafts, like FWD CV axles, that extend from the rubber-mounted differential.

The front suspension is a conventional MacPherson strut setup, with a lower control arm and ball joint tied to the spindle/hub assembly and suspended by a coil-over strut assembly. The 300ZX was available with an electronically adjustable suspension system, which was operated by a switch on the center console. It adjusted the strut damping between 3 modes, namely Soft, Neutral and Firm. I understand that the electronic struts are EXTREMELY expensive to replace, so if you don't want/need the adjustable suspension, don't buy it. However, the adjustable struts can be replaced with conventional struts, so if the electronic ones kick the bucket it's not the end of the world.

The engine used in the 300ZX is the Nissan 3.0L v6, the same engine used in the Maxima, Pathfinder, and various Infiniti models. It consists of a cast iron block, aluminum SOHC (single overhead cam) cylinder heads and cast-iron crank/rods attached to flat-top or dished aluminum pistons. The main bearing caps were cast as a one-piece girdle to provide more structural rigidity, but other than that there's nothing really exciting about this engine. It uses a relatively standard fuel injection system, whereby the MAF (mass airflow sensor) measures the amount of air ingested by the engine and regulates fuel delivery. The crank angle sensor dictates injector pulse width/timing and ignition advance/retard, and various other sensors (almost too many to list) provide input to the ECU in order to make the engine run as efficiently as possible. There is a fuel cutoff at 6500 rpm and the fuel is also turned off during deceleration, to conserve gas and wear-and-tear on the engine. Turbo models come equipped with a knock sensor and an emergency relief valve (aka; blowoff valve) to help the ECU deal with the boost. Power output for the naturally aspirated v6 (in 1984, of course) was 160 horsepower, and 200 horses for the turbocharged version. Available transmissions were the 5-speed manual overdrive transmission or the 4 speed overdrive automatic transmission.

The 300ZX was designed as more of a Grand Touring car than a race car. The interior was equipped with almost every amenity you can imagine, from a fully adjustable power driver's seat to an optional digital dash. They were available with or without the glass T-tops, and all models were equipped with air conditioning and a digital climate control system. On top of all this, the car comes with a voice warning system that alerts the driver to such things as open doors, the parking brake, and headlights if the vehicle starts moving/put in gear/turned off with one or more of these conditions uncorrected. It was also available, from the factory, with a built-in security system that detected forced entry attempts.

On the road, the car is an excellent handler, with heavy yet quick steering and superb feedback through the seat, pedals and steering wheel. The interior is comfortable, even for tall people such as myself, and the guages are clearly marked and easily visible to the driver (although the digital dash takes a little getting used to). The car does feel somewhat heavy at times, particularly at slower speeds, but the power assist takes most of the arm-straining effort out of the steering. Not to mention the power! The turbo model can do 7.3 second 0-60 times, which may not sound fast except when compared to the majority of BRAND NEW passenger cars available to the public. Those newer Honda Accord v6's and VW VR6's may give you a run for your money, but other than that, everything is cake. That punk kid in the riced out Civic? Cake. That jerk in the pickup truck that cut you off at the last light? Cake. That tricked out 5.0 Mustang revving his engine in the next lane over? Well, maybe not EVERYTHING, but almost ;)

That's it, in a nutshell. Things to watch for would be battery drain due to the large amount of power doo-dads (it takes a lot of juice to power the ECU and security system and all that jazz 24/7), water leakage from the T-tops and RUST. Yes, that's right, Nissans are notorious for rust, and the 300ZX is no different. Check EVERYTHING for rust when you buy a used car, regardless of the make and model. On the 300ZX, rust often starts at the rear of the car in the spare tire well and under the factory toolkit, as well as on the rear fenders (yech!). If everything checks out, have fun with your new car!<br><br>
