            To everyone, this is about cars in general.

Does everyone know that cars used to have mostly timing chains which are metal?   And that now many cars using timing &quot;belts&quot; which are made of reinforced rubber which simply does not last as long?   

My 1986 Subaru wagon snapped the timing belt on the freeway and the Washington State Patrol kindly pushed me off the freeway.  Only then did I learn that I was supposed to have replaced the timing belt before 80,000 miles.  Well I had 122,000 miles on my Subaru when the timing belt broke.  My former 1979 Toyota Corolla was still on the original timing belt at 145,000 miles so I was kind of spoiled.

 I now own a 1999 Plymouth Voyager and know that when I hit 60,000 miles its time to start worrying about the timing belt.  That's when the maintenance schedule say's to replace this belt which I was told to cost $350 on top of my $375 maintenance.   With tax here that's almost $800!

 Timing belts do break, whether they are metal or rubber.   To blame any car manufacturer of building a defective product when your timing belt breaks on you when you were not expecting it is unfair.  

What I don't like is the salespeople failing to inform car buyers of this fact when they buy a new or used vehicle.  That we should expect to pay $300 to $400 at a certain mileage to replace the timing belt.  Most auto manufacturers recommend replacing the dang thing for a good reason.  They don't last forever.  Now my question is, is there a car engine out there that says its timing belt/chain will easily last 100,000 before needing replacement?  I sure would like to know if such an engine exists.  Do even the expensive $40,000 to $50,000 luxury cars have timing belts that do not need replacement before say 80,000 miles or more?

 I know from owning cars over 30 years that when your car gets over 50,000 to 75,000 miles you can expect your water pumps, fuel pumps, and any belt to wear out.  Same for the brakes.  Many parts wear out and its really a question of are you intelligent enough to understand what to anticipate will wear out and to be mentally and financially prepared to fix it before it does major damage?  

On the other hand I agree with some of the problems I have read about here.  Not even proper preventive maintenance would have stopped these problems from occurring. I tend to believe some of us got cars with problems that should have been taken care of by the auto manufacturers, at their expense. 

I have never bought a new vehicle so my 1999 Plymouth Voyager is my first.  I have only 9400 miles on it so do not feel qualified to say anything at this point.  One very noisy wiper blade was replaced. I do have a problem with certain parts of the freeway where my Voyager tends to make little hops over and over again till I pass certain parts of the freeway.  My 1986 Subaru GL Wagon never felt this way so I am not happy about this less than desirable trait.  I had the dealer road test it over the same part of the freeway and they saw nothing wrong.  (Of course)  I have not had time to see them again on this but its on my list of things to do.  I want to borrow a demo and drive over the same road for comparison testing.   And also why did they not put door pockets on the doors?   I miss this feature from my Subaru wagon.

  So far I do like my Voyager. I like all the room compared to my 
ex-Subaru station wagon. I also like sitting much higher so I can see more of the road.  I like the flat front floor.  My friend has a GMC Astro van and its engine intrudes into the front passenger compartment so you cannot stretch your legs out to the side.  They put the huge engine covering between the driver and passenger.  Its like sitting next to a large boulder.

What I don't like is the expensive Maintenance Schedule.  At 7500 miles its $122, at 15000 miles its $375 to $435 (depends if you have AWD), and so on.  For the first 45,000 miles the cost of this schedule is around $2300 to $2500! Ouch. Do we have to have a $53 front wheel alignment every 7500 miles?

  So far I would recommend this vehicle but I have less than 10,000 miles.
Lets see when I have 30,000 to 50,000 miles like some of you have.
