            This is a very reliable car, lot of power from it's power plant, easily accomodates 5 passengers and the leg room in the rear seats is very acceptable for a compact car.
I own the Limited Edition with electric sunroof but it stops working about a month after I purchased new from the dealership.
The handling is like a sports car even in the GXE model and the engine is so smooth and noise free in the cabin.
Good seats, not the best but at least with 8 way position and electric controls.
The stereo sound is very acceptable but not the better one on Nissan cars. The ride is so smooth and the suspension feels like a larger car.
The new redisegned front end looks a little like a Maxima but the rear end still the same as 98 model.
Keyless entry with security code in the key as standard anti-theft system on every Altima.
The car is so funny to drive and the reliability and brand name reputation are the best aspects in this car.
