            I don't actually own the Kodak DC240, which is why I'm going to have to ask Santa for one in December.  Our family's camera is a Largan.  I don't even think it has a number; considering what we paid for it, they probably couldn't <i>afford</i> to put a number on it.

But I work at a CVS, and one of the services offered in our photo lab is making passport pictures.  We do this using the Kodak DC240 digital camera with a Kodak Picture Maker.  

The Picture Maker is a handy little toy.  It's a machine that lets you scan pictures and print them on photo paper.  Or you can pull pictures off a floppy, CD, or digital camera memory card.  With the picture, you can enlarge, zoom, crop, adjust color, reduce red-eye, restore color, etc.  

Our Largan camera came with a program called Adobe Photo Editor, which can do all that stuff and more, so if you're into home photo editing, I would recommend it - in fact, I did: <a href='/cmd-review-3C63-A3473BB-39BFD034-prod1'>http://www.epinions.com/cmd-review-3C63-A3473BB-39BFD034-prod1</a>.  

But if you don't have the interest or ability to edit your photos at home, I suggest you use the Picture Maker.  (If you don't know what a Kodak Picture Maker is, go to your local CVS, Eckerd's, WalMart, Walgreen's, K-mart, etc.  Most retailers that have a photo lab have a Picture Maker.)

My point is that I have a pretty good handle on the features of the DC240.  For one thing, it's very easy to use.  Point and shoot.  Then just load it into your computer and edit your photos.  The dial on the back lets you toggle between modes; for instance, <i>Capture</i> mode when you're taking the picture, <i>Review</i> when you want to see the pictures on the memory card, etc.  There's also a video screen on the back of the camera that shows the picture exactly as it will look when you take it.  (This is standard on higher-priced and better mid-priced digital cameras; but our family camera wasn't high- <i>or</i> mid-priced, so when I first saw the video screen on the DC240, I was like, <i>&quot;Wow......&quot;</i>)

The quality of the pictures is very good.  In our store, we used the DC240 to take pictures of our pharmacists to put above their credentials;  even blown up to 8x10 (which is the largest photo size except for posters), the pictures were high-quality and not at all grainy.

Another thing I like about the camera is that it's small and very portable.  My sister likes to take pictures at the parties and dances she goes to, so tote-ability is key for her.  Our Largan camera runs off A/C power, so we really can't take it anywhere unless there's an electrical outlet.  I'm really looking forward to having a camera I can take outside, as <i>I</i> like to take pictures of more attractive things, like sunsets and mountains.  By the time I have the extension cord untangled, the sun's down.

There is one thing that this camera lacks:  a zoom.  I don't know if telephoto is standard on digital cameras or not, but the DC240 doesn't have it (at least, the one I use at work doesn't have it).  When you're taking portraits (or passport pictures) from a few feet away, this is an important feature.  When your subject is the mountains 20 miles away, though, a zoom isn't necessary.  So when you decide on a digital camera, make your decision according to what features you'll need to take good pictures of the things you like to photograph.
