            Because of the death of our Toyota's AC unit, my husband and I needed an inexpensive, yet dependable car to get us through the hot summers in Florida.  After searching for the right car and price, we settled on Saturn's lease option. <br><br>Though the cult-like chants and ceremonies performed at the conclusion of the purchase of our Saturn scared my son and embarrassed my husband, my family has thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated our car.  <br><br><br>It has been reliable, needing only regularly scheduled service and maintenance.  It gets great gas mileage on trips and in the city - we drove over 1000 miles on less than $30 dollars worth of gas.  Though we are having to upgrade to a larger vehicle - the '98 Saturn SL does lack in space -  as our family has grown, we will still keep the Saturn and plan to convert the lease into a purchase.  <br><br><br>We would definitely recommend this car to families on a tight budget.    <br><br><br>
