            I acquired the Kodak DC 265 in July 1999. I am a web designer and am in charge of 5 web sites (one on a campus). Its use is very easy and the quality is superb. Its zoom option allow you to work decently on your framework. The sound option is very useful too. You can record a sound as you take a picture. One of the most neat option is the small card that you can put in a PCMA card on the side of your portable computer (I have a Mac) and it takes only 3 seconds to have all your images on your desktop. You can then download them very quickly. Last summer I went to Haiti and took some shots that you can review at the following address: http://www.enc.edu/org./french/Haiti/haiti.html
I took recently pictures at Sturrbridge in a wonderful sunny day, the quality of the picture were really professional. In natural light t is a delight!
 You can check the pictures you took with the review button and delete them directly of you do not like it. There is also the option to take pictures with a small interval, like in a movie.
Be sure that the quality of the batteries for the camera are high and good when you travel. I let a friend used it for his trip to Israel but unfortunately the quality of the battery he bought over there were so low that he was unable to use it!
