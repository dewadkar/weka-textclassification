            This little pickup is a winner. It's quick, powerful, and fun to drive.
A great starter truck for consumers who can't afford the big trucks. 
The Tacoma is good on gas mileage, which is a big consideration with today's gas prices.

Five speed with power to spare. AC is great, 3 band AM/FM stereo cassette rocks.

Dual airbags with on/off switch for passenger side which is a big plus for parents with young children who shouldn't be exposed to an airbag.

I've driven this truck cross country twice so far, and I'd go anywhere in it again without hesitation. It's very reliable and has only been in the shop for scheduled oil changes.

The only cons I can think of is it's not the most comfortable of vehicle for long drives and poor traction is snow. But most pickups have that same problem.
I love my Tacoma!<br><br>
