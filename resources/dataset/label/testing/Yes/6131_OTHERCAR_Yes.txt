            When I drove into the Chevy Dealership for the first time, There it was.  The Impala (LS).  

I had been to many dealerships looking at all different types and brands of cars, Many had great appeal.  But when I saw the Impala, My eyes were glued, and my mouth drooling.  It was amazing. It looked like a sedan.. but with the spoiler it looks like a sweet sports car.

When Looking for cars, I wanted to find a car that was fast and quick, that's all I cared about, at first.. Then I realized more what I was going to need, so I looked at suvs, sedans, and vans.  None could meet my appeal to the price.

When I saw the impala, I had to Test it.  As I drove around the city streets, I started to feel something.  I had to press the gas pedal.. quickly, around this corner.. at this light.. and so forth.  Everytime, The engine roared, and the car launched down the road. I was amazed.  It had ALL I need; Speed, Luxury, and cabin space.  With the ability to turn off the impala's traction control (keeps tires from spinning on slippery surfaces) Gives the car practically the ability of having 50 more horses under the hood because with the system off, there's no restrictions on the wheel-to-road surface contact.  

I admit it.  I race it.  Street race against any car that I challenge, or challenges me.  I usually win.  I've beat Everything from SUV's To Japanese Imports, To Sedans, to Mild sports cars.  Honestly though.. It's kind of funny to see the look on someones face, after you win the race (either flying down a stretch of road, or traffic racing) that's thinkin &quot;Wait a minute.. I just lost to a 4 door seventeen foot long sedan with 5 people inside!!!???&quot;  

I love my Impala, I treat it with respect at all times.  I don't always race it. I drive it normally too. With the responsive breaks, quick acceleration and traction control makes your entire drive, practically worry free.

I've taken it on long road trips, and drive it everyday, It's the most reliable, Fun, and safest car I've ever seen.  The steering is so responsive that you can maneuver any situation with relative ease.  

I can Guarantee you that this car is perfect for you, no matter what you're looking for.  It Has space, Speed, Luxury, Comfort, and it's Very High tech compared to most other 2000 Car models.

I Always have Complete strangers off the street ask me about it, ask if they can look inside of it, teenagers telling me to show them what I got (I do it sometimes.. heh)   Everyone I know Loves it.  And According to epinions percentage rate of people who like it and who don't, I'll bet the 4 percent that don't like it, haven't driven one. Heh.
