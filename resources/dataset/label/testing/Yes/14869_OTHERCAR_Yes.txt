            This is an outstanding camera, I have used the camera at work for sometime and have always been impressed with it!  When it came time for me to buy one for myself this is the camera I wanted...but it is expensive I must say a little over the price I wanted to spend.  I looked for a while and actually found this camera for under $300.00 prices are really dropping on digital camera everyday.  You still have to search for a deal because this camera does normally list at around $600.00.
Now about the camera, the first and most important is that it uses regular floppy disks and not that expensive and unrealiable photo or smart cards. This also means that you do not need a photo card reader..yea! saving you about $65.00.

It has a LCD screen which is great but is hard to see in bright sunlight, but it is backlit for seeing it in the dark.

It has a review and delete feature which is pretty much standard on all digital cameras, but on this one you can also format and diskcopy just like you can do on your home computer.

It has a 10x zoom and is very clear and quick!

It has a built in flash that can be turned off

It has a screen that can be programed for your preferences

The battery that comes with it is good for 2000 photos or 21/2 hours and best of all its rechargeable and the charger comes with it..it charges from empty to full in about 1/2 hour

The battey that maintanes the time and date is a standard watch battery once again very cheap to replace.

Photo quality is excellent and though it may look washed out on the LCD screen it looks excellent on your computer

There may seem to be a large initial price for this camera but its very cheap to use and maintane so it equals out in the end.<br><br>
