            I decided to lease a 2000 Camry Solara just for the look of the newly designed body.  This car is just beautiful.  I don't really want to go for the SLE model, but I just gotta have the leather seat, therefore, I got the car for 1K over their invoice, which turned out to be around 23K for a 2000 V6 SE model with VIP option and I think that's about it.  Then I have the dealership called their &quot;leather man&quot; out to do the seats, gosh, they look so much nicer than the original SLE leather, I meant, the cost was only 1.2K which if you choose a SLE model, it will cost you about 2.5K more just for leather, spoiler, and other little gadgets of the car.  With a 198 hp and a nicely built V6 engine, this car really gets going, not as fast as the other cars I have of course, but definitely a nice car to drive for a little while.  A car with lots of class, but you won't feel old in it, like a Mercedes S430.<br><br>
