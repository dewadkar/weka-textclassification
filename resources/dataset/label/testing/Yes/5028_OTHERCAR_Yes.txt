               My mother drives a buick. That fact alone has always caused me to steer away from Buick's. I have spent my life seeing every Buick on the road as a &quot;family&quot; car, and everyone knows that family cars are no fun to drive. Boy was I wrong!
   The Buick Regal looks sharp. It has clean, beautiful lines, and seems to be looking down like an animal ready to pounce. The v-6 engine is very powerful. It doesn't seem to have any limits to its speed (too bad the highways do). The Anti-lock braking system  makes stopping quick and easy. The Regal also handles wonderfully.
   Despite having many characteristics of a sports car, the Regal is roomy and comfortable enough to be a luxury ride. It comes with all the standard bells and whistles of other new cars, as well as few extra nice features.
   Overall the Buick Regal is a great ride. I can't believe how wrong I was.<br><br>
