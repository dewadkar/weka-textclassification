                 When I first got the car, I loved it for about 20 minutes because the car overheated on the way home because the cooling fan decided to stop working on me.  But once I cooled down, and fixed it, I loved it again.  About a month later, I had a stream of bad luck. All in one week, I have no idea how I did this, but I fried my computer, blew out my transmision, clutch and the intermiediate differential (runs the rear wheels). But I got it all fixed for about $3000.00.  I probably caused the problems.
      If  you are to buy a Talon, don't waste your money and buy a Non-Turbo car, buy the TSI.  For the power, it is surely worth the little extra cash.  These cars are very cheap to upgrade and there are so many useful websites out there. For less than $20, you can gain about 60 hp with about 15 minutes of work by placing a manual boost controler under the hood.  With this you can control the amount of boost your turbo puts out.  Stock, the turbo will max out at 9psi and with the MBC, you can easily get 19psi but the ECU (Electronic Control Unit -Computer) will keep it at 15psi unless you get the ECU upgrade.  
     Everybody says "These cars are so expensive to repair!"  Not true.  If you become a member of Club DSM (Diamond Star Motors), you can receive a 25-30% discount from Conicelli Parts at www.Partznet.com.  They are located in Pittsburgh, but they do ship all over the country.  If you there are problems with the car, there is another site that gives you step-by-step instructions on how to repair the problem and quickly. WWW.VFAQ.Com has got to be the most useful, educating and helpful website on the web, God bless the owner for helping me out.  If you have any questions on a specific concern, you can post a message at Speed Extremities, it is a message board created for DSM owners, the members of the board are very helpful and are always willing to help you out.  The web address is www.pub13.ezboard.com/bspeedextremities, you should check it out.  
     Now for all the DSM owners, in Norwalk OH, every summer, there is whats called a DSM Shoot Out sponsered by Dave Bousher, where all the DSM owner from around the country get together and race and party.  I did not go last year because I didn't own the car yet, but the DSM SO 2001 should be off the hook, it's taking place on the weekend of 07/20/01.  If you are interested in going, you should check out the hotels and get a reservation A.S.A.P.
Well, I hope that the opinion is helpfull for you.
Thank You.
