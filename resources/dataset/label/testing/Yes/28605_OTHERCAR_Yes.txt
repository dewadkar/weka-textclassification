            I bought a 91' Mitsubishi Mirage for the gas mileage.  It gets very good gas mileage.  It also has a nice ride to it.  It hugs the road very well and isn't very noisy.  It is very comfortable and looks good.  I love the interior of the car.  It has a nice design to it and the control panel is very efficient.  The only thing I don't like about the car is that it doesn't have cruise control.  I recommend this vehicle to anyone that has to travel a lot.  It is a nice car for someone to get around in the city.  If travel around the states a lot than I recommend  that you get one of these cars, because it will hold up to the mileage and won't cost you a lot for gas.<br><br>
