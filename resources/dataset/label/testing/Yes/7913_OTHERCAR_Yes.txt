            I am fairly new to the digital camera world but I did a lot of research for a client who was looking to buy.  While looking for his camera I found the Canon A20 along with others but the Canon always won out in the reviews.  It didn't meet my clients needs, however, it would meet mine.  So I decided after about 2 months of reading reviews and talking to owners, sellers, etc.. to give it a try.  I'm glad I did too.  I am running Win XP Professional at home and this has created a little havoc with other software, NOT for the Canon A20.  I loaded the drivers and after taking a few shots plugged it in and whammo it found the camera and asked me what to do.  This is one of the easiest to use cameras I have ever owned.  I did however spend the money and buy the Rayovac model ps4 1-hr fast battery recharger and NiMH batteries. It doesn't eat them as quickly as it does regular batteries.  I also bought an additional 64 MB Sandisk memory card, which is cheaper than the Kodak memory cards.  The old saying holds true "You get what you pay for."  I would recommend this camera to anyone who is new to the digital world.
