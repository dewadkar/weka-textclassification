            I have owned many cars through out the years. And the Dodge Intrepid has to be my favorite by far!! 
When i was looking to buy i wanted a larger car that would make me feel safe on the road, good on gas, sporty looking, roomy interior.

Well i found the car!! I purchased the 1999 Intrepid on December 31, 1999 it is a very roomy automobile that hold six pasengers no problem! Mileage is great I average 700km per tank (highway driving). The only thing i don't like about the car is the blind spots, with the rear end of the car being so high it creates many of them. But i also found a solution for
that,buy the extended rear view mirror and will take away those blind spots.

People that should buy this car is anyone that is looking for a reliable, comfortable, safe riding car.
