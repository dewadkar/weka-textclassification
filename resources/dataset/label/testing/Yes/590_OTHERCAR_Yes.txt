            I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee for 3 years and needed a new car, so I test drove the 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. I didn't like it. I'm 6'1", and my head was almost touching the roof! I could barely see out of the windscreen, no matter how I adjusted the seats. It also felt pretty "trucky" and I was starting to get fed up with loose handling and steering - and like most people, I never take my car offroad. 

So, I checked out the Lexus without really having done much research on it. My friend with me saw my face when I got into the car, and said he knew I was going to buy it. He was right! The first impression you get is that you are sitting in a glasshouse. There are so many windows, and with them coupled with the moonroof it almost feels like a convertible! The leather was impeccable and very much an intended part of the car, whereas in the Jeep it felt like the leather was an afterthought in design to try and nab some Lexus customers.

The test drive was very impressive. You won't believe how quiet the car is - definitely quieter than any other car I've been in. The brakes handle very well - I even tested the Brake Assist (where the car brakes extra hard if it detects you are in an emergency) and it stops *very* fast.

The automatic transmission has convinced some of my staunch stick-only friends to believe that automatics can indeed perform. I have to say that the transition from 1st to 2nd at high rev's is nothing less than astonishing - you wouldn't even notice that you have changed gear.

So I bought one!

I got the new blue paint ("Indigo Pearl"), which is very distinctive. It's not the most popular colour, but I would highly recommend it over the black and champagne colours. 

I got all the options except the DVD/Navigation system ($5K vs. $30 maps...hmmm?) and it's a beauty. I adore my car. Notice I don't say SUV - I really regard it as a car, as it doesn't have the usual heavy truck trappings of an SUV (low differential switchover, ladder frame chassis, etc). If you want an SUV, get the Jeep or the Lexus LX.

As for negatives, I have a few but they are *very* minor compared to the positives. The first is that the steering wheel is a little too close to the dash, leading to a bit of a reach when I'm turning on my blinkers. I've tried many, many times to adjust the seats and I've got it pretty good now, but I would still like the wheel to be about 3 inches closer to me. 

The CD sound system and changer is excellent, but the bass is a little lacking on it. I am a confirmed audiophile, so most people won't be too bothered by this. 

All in all this is a truly incredible car, and you will not regret buying it. It has so many nice touches that never cease to amuse and amaze me - like how the mirrors dim if someone blinds you from behind; or how the A/C works cleverly by not blasting you with cold air on a cold morning when you switch it to 80 degrees - instead it waits until the heater gets warm and brings up the air power bit by bit; or how smooth the cruise control is; etc..etc...

Just test drive it, that's all I will say.
