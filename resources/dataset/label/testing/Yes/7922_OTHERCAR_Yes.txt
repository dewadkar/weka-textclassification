            The Basics:

I previously owned an Acura 1996 GS-R, which was a great car.  The car was well made and very fast when the v-tec kicked it and the rpm shot to 8000!  However, when I drove the new Civic Si (i-vtec), I realized I was more grown up from my fast and furious days.  The new H-series engines on Civic Si/"Acura"RSX are more smoother, less harsher, delivers more hp power/torque at lower rpm which makes driving fast on regular streets a breeze and very enjoyable without having your heart beating like crazy from the screeching of the v-tec.

Civic Si vs. RSX:

When searching for my new car, I looked at the Acura RSX (not S-Type) first, which was a great car at $21,000  with leather.  Then I went to the other end of the spectrum, Civic Ex Coupe, was a disappointment after owning a GS-R and driving a RSX.  But, I noticed a hatchback all decked out parked on the lot by its lonely self.  I had to test drive it.  ONLY the "Civic Si" shares the same engine and drive train as the RSX.  THE SAME!!!  The same engine is a 2.0 liter i-vtec 160hp.  The car drove just like the RSX and at a savings of $4000 bucks and a large hatchback cargo space to boot; I didnt have to think twice about the Si.  I thought the Civic Si was faster than the RSX (not S-Type), probably due to less weight of the Si.

Other mentions:

The Civic Si is a great car, made in England, and not in the US like the other Civics, you can drive it fast and furious comfortably like a Lexus.  It handles great, its fully loaded, NO options except side airbags.  The Recaro racing type seats are awesome!!!  At first glance, my friends frowned at the placement of the shifter which is located on the dash like an Alfa Romeo Spyer.  But after they drive it, they love it b/c its very comfortable. The only thing I want to change the wheel/tire package which is just adequate.  A 16" wheel/tire package will greatly improve the handling.
