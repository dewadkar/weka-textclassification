            The All New Jeep Grand Cherokee slick outside design is alost as heart biting as its extremely advanced interior.  The Loaded cherokee comes with everything that is desired.  From two settings for Air conditioner/ heat to power seats, mirrors, and everything else imaginable.  
There are weaknesses to this car.  First of all, it eats gas like no one elses business.  I mean your lucky to get 15 mph on the highway and 12 in the city.  Furthermore, the ride at times can be bumpy although it is improved from the old version.  Overall, if you like to be elevated high above the group and are a sporty type or a SUV type, than this Jeep will bring you everything you want and luxury as well.<br><br>
