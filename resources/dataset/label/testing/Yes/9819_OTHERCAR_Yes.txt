            Having owned several Camaros over the years I have learned how great of a car Chevrolet has produced.  My newest was a 97 loaded out z28 which is the best so far.  I purchased the 97 because someone negelected to learn how to drive before driving next to me on the freeway in the rain and totaling my 95.  The car received just at $18,000 in damage and I walked away with out even a bruise.  I swear by the safety that these cars provide.  The redesigned dash eliminated the squeaks and rattles associated with the earlier fourth gens(93-present).  This was the last year for the LT1 motor which was replaced by the LS1.  The seating in the camaro is excellent up front with a little to be desired for the rear if you are over 5'10&quot;.  As far as handling and speed goes, this car is second only to $50,000 cars.  I have been in the newer Mustangs, the other car in the same class.  The front seats don't slide back as far and leave you feeling cramped and the rear seat is for short people only as I left the car with several new dents in the top of my head from the back window, something that didn't happen while in the back of the Z28.  With options that take the car from around $15,000(a base model w/ v6 and a/c) up to the screaming SS w/ over 300 horsepower that stickers around $30,000 and can blow by anything short of a military spy plane, there is a car to be found for anyone under the Camaro badge.<br><br>
