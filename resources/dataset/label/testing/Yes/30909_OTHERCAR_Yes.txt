                I shopped for quite awhile looking for the perfect family vehicle.  Being a stay at home mom, price was of the essence.  Although I knew I could not afford a loaded vehicle, there were certain features I was not going to do without.  To me rear air condition was very important, especially with back windows that only vent out slightly.  What good is buying a minivan that seats 7 if only 4 people can get air or heat? Many of the minivans I looked at required that you buy more than the base model in order to even add rear air on as an option at an extra price.  With the villager I was able to add it on their base with a $495 option.
    The exterior looks of the villager are not my favorite of minivans, but with its standard luggage rack and some added tints it is not to shabby looking.  The interior is nicely made and the front captain seats are roomy and comfortable.  The middle row is a bench seat.  Captain seats are not available for the middle in the base model.  Second and third row seats are removable and are not that heavy to lift compared to some models.  I would of liked a darker interior color(most interior choices are fairly light) and a little more cargo space.  
    The drive of the vehicle is smoother than most, with exceptional handling.  There is a very slight wind noise when going at excessive speeds. The Mercury Villager 2000 is big enough to fit 7, yet small enough to park in any space with ease.
     The Mercuy Villager is an affordable minivan for the whole family.  It is very similar to the Nissan Quest with style and value, however with a customer rebate of $1500* you can drive away with a Mercury for a lower price.


*Check your local dealer to see if rebate is still available.  <br><br>
