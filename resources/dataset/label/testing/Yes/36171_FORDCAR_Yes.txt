            The 2000 Ford Focus wagon is a winner.  It has comparable interior room to the Subaru Legacy and Outback, and similar cargo capacity to the Volvo V70.  While it may be a replacement for the Escort, it is miles ahead of the econo-legend.

Thumbs Up:
The styling is of the love-it or leave-it variety, either way, it's eye-catching.  The car handles very well, and the interior room is amazing. Cargo capacity is great for a car of this size.  Interior head room exceeds that of many larger cars.  Driver's side height-adjustable seat is unheard of in this class, but it's here.  Functional, adjustable roof rack.  Seats are very comfortable, and rear seat bottom folds up/back splits 60/40 to allow for completely flat cargo area or rear passenger and cargo as necessary.

Could be improved:
The armrest in front.  It should be anchored to the floor, and made deeper to improve upon usability.  While power is adequate, a larger engine or manual transmission should be available in the wagon--and the base engine should be eliminated for the wagon, with the Ztec made standard.  Front seat-back pockets would be an improvement for storage.
