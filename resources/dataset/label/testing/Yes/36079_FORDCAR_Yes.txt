            My husband and I were shopping for a &quot;good&quot; used car or SUV, when an enterprising dealer here in Seattle introduced us to the &quot;new experience&quot; of the Ford Focus (September '99). We had some specific features in mind, to meet our comfort needs, that were missing in most cars we had looked at; &quot;he&quot; is 5' and needs to have accessibility to controls yet feel like he is  &quot;in control&quot;  of his vehicle.  On the other hand,  I am 6'2&quot;  and needed both leg  and  head  room  (elusive in so many other models these days), back and seating support, and a car which could adjust to both our size irregularities. The FOCUS was an immediate success in &quot;measuring up&quot; (or, down), to our needs.  Additionally, I desired an &quot;excellent&quot; sound system and classy, yet aerodynamic, styling; again FOCUS was &quot;Right-on&quot;! He wanted power and response, and boys!,... did he get it!  This  car accelerates, handles, hugs to the road, and stops, as if it is reading your mind; the rapid yet controlled response of the FOCUS lends renewed confidence to the feeling of safety and control on-the-road!  As for styling and comfort, the FOCUS (economically priced),  rates right up there with the (much) higher priced luxury European cars.  This Euro-Designed delight puts &quot;centricity&quot; into the Power of Ego, as every eye is upon you while driving; the FOCUS2000 is a &quot;fashion statement&quot;in driving!
Another most excellent feature of the FOCUS, is the maintenance package which is included in the purchase(a must for my husband). Our dealership here in Seattle has certainly met and surpassed the quality of &quot;customer service&quot; provided by most dealerships.  (Yours  my  vary  in  what  is offered.) Needless to say, &quot;WE BECAME THE PLEASANTLY PROUD OWNERS OF A 2000 FORD FOCUS (saffire blue), on the very day we were introduced! You really should give the FOCUS a test-drive, as it will change your mind about quality/style/comfort in driving.!<br><br>
