            The redesigned Jetta for 1999 is a very good car overall.  It accelerates nicely and handles nicely.  I enjoy taking the turns in this car a faster speeds than I should.  However, the car does have it's downsides.  For one, when you shift the gearbox (automatic) from Park to Drive or to Reverse, etc., it takes a moment or so for the transmission to actually respond to the gear box and shift.  Another downside, is the lighting of the stereo LCD.  The LCD is only back-lit when all the lights (as opposed to just the daytime-running lights) are on.  Otherwise, if you drive into -- let's say a garage -- you have the strain your eyes to read the black-on-gray digits.  Also the stereo can be slow at tuning.  After pressing one of the five station preset buttons, you must wait about 0.75 seconds for the radio to actually tune-in.  Also, the buttons are not very ergonomic for the driver, whose fingers must exerts a forward push, rather then an easier downward push.  The stereo button are a bit small are too close to one another.  Other than that, the lay-out of the controls in the car is great, except for maybe the window buttons for all but the driver.  The passengers will find themselves in an awkward position pushing the window buttons located near the hinge side of the doors and situated parallel to the window -- this is not very ergonomic either.  The trunk can fool you sometimes into thinking you have closed it properly, but don't be fooled.  Check to see that the trunk lid actually locked in position before leaving it.  Another downside is the somewhat "wery" power steering.  It tends to make a somewhat loud "wer" when you operate it at slow speeds.  Also some engine noise can seep into the car when the RPMs are above 3000, but still not as loud as the power steering.  The moonroof on the car is nice and is controlled by a dial, so you don't have to keep you finger on a button until the roof is open to the desired point.  However, when closing the moonroof, be sure to set the dial to the close position, for it can be easy to miss.  If you get the moonroof, you also get a fancy set of aluminum wheels, which look really nice, but can take some effort to clean thoroughly.
I pointed out a few of the inconveniences that might have been fixed since the redesign, but overall this is a great car.
Happy Driving!
