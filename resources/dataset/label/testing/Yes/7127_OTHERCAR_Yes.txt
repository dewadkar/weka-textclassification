            I love the Miata. It is a high performance sports car. I love to drive it with the five-speed manual transmission, or I love to just sit back and be a passenger. The leather interior is stylish, and comfortable. The CD player is a great option. The soft top looks very sleek, and hides away under a very nicely styled cover. The handling is great, it can be very smooth, depending on the driver's experience behind a stick shift.  The back-lit gauges are a nice touch, and are very pleasing to the eye. Over all, the Miata is a nice sports car, with everything one could want. It's a great addition to a car collection, or it's nice as a family vehicle just for the adults.<br><br>
