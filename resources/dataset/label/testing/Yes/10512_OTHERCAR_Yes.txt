            Very few people know what a great find the Acura TL really is.  When you put the TL up against just about every other entry luxury vehicle, there is no comparison.

We just placed our order for our new 2000 TL after researching so many other vehicles and test driving too many to count.  We went into the process thinking that we wanted the Lexus ES 300 -- after all, it's an extremely luxurious vehicle with a fantastic ride.  However, after stumbling upon the TL, we quickly changed our mind.  

For one thing, everything on the TL is standard (the only option is their Navigation System) -- things like heated seats, heated mirrors, moonroof, leather seats, CD player, sequential sports shift -- everything is included in the MSRP.  What you see is what you get.  Also, the ride of the TL is better than the ES 300. It's a five speed automatic (vs. 4-speed for the Lexus) with undetectible shifting (you can't feel a thing).  The TL has the most horsepower in its class (225) with more headroom, legroom, and cargo space than most of its competition.  And the best part?  You get a better vehicle with better options and a better ride for less money.  The TL is by far the best value in its class coming in around $2,000 less than its closest competitor (this is not including the Navigation System).

So few people know about this car!  It's actually kind of nice -- you don't see a lot of them on the road (yet).

I highly recommend the 2000 Acura TL if you're shopping in the entry luxury segment.  There isn't a better buy out there.

Note:  If you don't believe me, check out the automotive press.  Last month's Car &amp; Driver issue found the TL to be superior to eight of its closest competitors.  And I haven't read one thing that contradicts this yet!<br><br>
