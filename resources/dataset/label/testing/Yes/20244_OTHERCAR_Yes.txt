            This vehicle belongs to my parents. They bought it about a year ago and it now has around 15K miles on it. It has been an excellent car for them and I have borrowed a few times before I bought my new car. During the weeks that I had possession of the Chevy Malibu I was amazed at some of the features it had to offer. The ride was very comfortable and the handling is very nice. The car is very powerful as well. I found that it could accelerate to 30 or 40 in just the blink of an eye. A die-hard Honda fan/co-worker who seems to have everything going against American cars was riding with me one day. He admitted that he was amazed at the raw power yet smooth ride the car offered. I've also heard from others who have driven the Malibu and claim the ride is smooth at 120 mph. However, I would have no idea about such a thing nor would I encourage it. Needless to say, the things I can say about the vehicle and the things I've heard combine as quite a testament to the wonderful car the Malibu is. I would recommend it to anyone who can afford it.<br><br>
