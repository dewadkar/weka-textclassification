            The Mitsubishi Montero has operated adequately, offered me the amenities I need (hitch to pull a boat, roomy back compartment to carry loads), and has been a decent vehicle.  Overall, I might recommend it, depending on what the consumer needs it for.

However, I personally do not find the Montero luxurious.  It drives like a truck and you feel every bump in the road.  I don't have a remote/keyless entry system.  The chassis shrieks when I turn a hard left or right. Maybe that can be fixed, but why isn't it right to start out?  The display console is not exciting; the indoor environment buttons are simple, not offering an automatic temperature maintenance feature. The driver and passenger seats are not electric. Basically, the instrument panels do not excite me, and for the price that I paid for the Montero, I want to be excited!

On the positive side, I really like being up high when I drive. It's easier to see what's going on and drive safer as a result.  I like the appearance of my Montero, and its speed and power is adequate for my uses. Also, I do have a CD player, and I haven't had any problems with that. 

In the past, I've had several Diamantes by Mitsubishi, and that is what I will get next time.
