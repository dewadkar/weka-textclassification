            I have been an automotive freak my whole life, European sport cars to be exact. I take pride in knowing my facts and enjoy talking about my toys,like every man I know. The Saab Viggen was not a choice in the beginning it was curiosity that led me to the Saab dealership in Marin,CA. I have driven and owned many fast European cars mainly Porsche with a couple of generations of M3s thrown in there. The Viggen is not the quickest but is still doing 0-60 in 5.9 seconds in a five door,not bad. The shifter and transmission could be a little more precise. I am used to Porsche's precise movement but I can live with it. The feeling of driving this car is rewarding as I have 6 thousand miles on my car and it is less than 2 months old! It is very comfortable and stylish and the chances of pulling up to a street light and seeing another Viggen is almost 0% which is the main reason for my purchase. I highly recommend this car as it has been to the shop once for its 1000 service and has been a delight to drive.I think anyone looking for something different and fast should at least take a peek, I think that you will be glad you did. I am 30 years old and loving this car! <br><br>
