            1989 WAS a good year!  I've had mine (Celica ST) since 1995 and other than routine maintenance, I've had no major problems.  Granted, I only drive 5,000 miles per year (it now has only 55,000 miles), but I'm convinced that, mechanically speaking, this car will last as long as I want it to.  Several mechanics that have serviced this car have remarked how excellent these Toyotas are.  They truly are excellent cars.  The trunk is actually very reasonably sized.

Having said that, there's nothing glamorous about it.  My car has no power features, it's definitely not designed for tall folks (if you're over 5'10&quot;, stay away), it has an older frame, the paint is fading, the windows and doors aren't well sound insulated, and the stereo/tape deck/speakers are very basic.  Also, almost every '88-89 model I've seen has the same trype of deterioration of the window molding.  This won't affect performance, but it's just a bit of an eye sore.  Also, I've had some trouble with the power antenna and the exhaust system <br><br>
