            This vehicle is of no comparison to the X-terra, 4-runner, or Rodeo. The driving experience in this SUV puts me in the best position to write an opinion. I purchased the Montero Sport about 5 months ago and have no had any problems whatsoever. This vehicle handles more like a car than like a truck. The inside is the most luxurious in its class with front and rear easy built in cup holders, standard CD Player, great leather and very comfortable seats. The Montero comes is a wide spectrum of colors ranging from black and tan to all green. The ride of this SUV is quieter than any other I have seen. The only problem is it doesn't turn so great and the acceleration isn't much better but i guess that is expected in an SUV.<br><br>
