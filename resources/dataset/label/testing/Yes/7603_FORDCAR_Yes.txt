              My family purchased a 2 wheel drive Eddie Bauer edition expedition in 1998.  My father had this crazy idea of driving across the country in it.  Well we did and during the two weeks I spent in the car, I had plenty of time to analyze this truck.
  First off, it is great for long trips.  All but the third row seating is spacious.  There was enough room in the second row for two teenagers, a 19" TV (Good idea to keep the kids quiet), two bookbags, an ice chest, a small sized luggage, and a briefcase.
  The sound system is also good.  It has four 6x9 speakers in the doors and one 8" woofer in the rear.  It sounds perfect to the front driver and passenger, but the bass starts to overwhelm the treble as you move back to the third row.  This probably could be fixed if they had put more speakers in the back.  
  The 5.4 liter engine for this model year pumped out 230hp!  Plenty of power for cruising the streets.  The engine pulled strongly all the way up to 80 mph.  There was a great deal of torque available at low rpm (careful in the rain this beast can spin the tires and lose control).  This is great for towing large objects.  While I never had a chance to tow boats as I have seen others do, I did tow trailers stacked with furniture.  The expo didn't struggle whatsoever with the extra weight.  The only problem with the setup is the brakes.  They seem way to small even when driving the suv unloaded.
  There is a downside to all this trailer hauling goodness.  Over the passed three years the car has averaged 15.3 mpg!  When you stop at the gas pump, you seem to stand there for hours.  She hold 30 gallons of fuel, easily getting the price to $40.  Not exactly economical.  
  If you can take the hit on your wallet, this Monster suv can make those family trips to the beach and yellowstone national park much easier and fun.
