            The 2000 Ford Mustang GT is a car to be reckoned with.  I purchased my Mustang at my local Ford dealer back in October, and I must say that I am totally and thoroughly satisfied.

The first thing one will notice when purchasing a new Mustang GT compared to earlier models is the significant jump in horsepower (the 1998 model had 225HP, while the 1999 and 2000 models have 260HP, over a 15% increase!)  The new Stang is very throttle responsive compared to previous models (I owned a 1996 Mustang GT,) and it's tire-barking ability is uncanny (with optional traction-control toggled in the off position) for those rubber munchers out there.  It's 0-60mph times in under 6.5 seconds will leave you very satisfied as you leave those unlucky people behind you when the traffic light turns green.  Its new hard-edge design is sure to get looks everywhere you go; it looks aggressive like the 5.0's of lore.  Be prepared to shell out some cash for gas however, this beast loves to drink the factory recommended 87 octane fuel.  Overall quality is top notch, the new Mustang is quieter, feels like a luxury car in ride quality, yet maintains excellent handling in the turns.  

Comparisons: While the Mustang GT is not as powerful as GM's counterparts the Firebird TransAM or Formula, and the Chevrolet Camaro, it's quality exceeds those models by far.  I think sales prove that, as those models will soon be a thing of the past.

If you are a person that likes horsepower, quality of ride, and just loves to drive, the 2000 Ford Mustang GT is for you, test drive one today at your local Ford Dealer.<br><br>
