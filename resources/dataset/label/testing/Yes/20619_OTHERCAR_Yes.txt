            What a car.  

But first of all, you've for to go with the 2.8 Quattro.
Second, don't screw around, get the manual.

Now we're talking.  This automobile is pure all the way through.  From the 200hp V6 engine to the refined leather and wood interior, this car has it all and costs $4,000 less than a comparably equipped BMW.  A man's machine, the Audi 2.8 jumps of the line and corners like a dream.  Made to race German businessmen down the autobahn, the Audi will take you wherever you want to go.  I have had mine for a year, and have absolutely no complaints.  Profesional reviewers too, like Car and Driver, rave about the Audi 2.8.  So go ahead, indulge, live a little.  <br><br>
