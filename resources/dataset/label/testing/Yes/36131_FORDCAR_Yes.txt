            I wasn't keen on the idea of buying a small car at first.  I was actually shopping for a Ford Ranger.  But when the dealer mentioned how high the seat was I decided to take her for a spin.  I was amazed.  The Focus ZX3 drove amazingly well.  The power was responsive and the handling was sharp.  I felt very comfortable driving in city and highway traffic. (Traffic is defined as Rush Hour in Miami on I-95!)

I liked the Focus so much; I bought it and drove it home the same night.  Most of my friends couldn't believe I bought the Focus, since my other car is a 92 Mustang 5.0 LX.  My only displeasure is the acceleration, but it's very peppy for a 4 cylinder.

The interior is very roomy and with its extra high roof, the windows are taller and that in turn allows the interior to &quot;sit&quot; higher than most cars.  I find myself looking down at a lot of other cars.

I would recommend this car to anyone shopping in the economy/compact car market.  The Ford Focus rides very nicely, handles well and has good stopping power.  

There isn't much to complain about in Ford's new introduction into the American market.  But of course I have found a few things.

1. The lift mechanism that tips the front seats forward.  You have to push the level back towards the back seat and then you can push the front seat forward.  Why didn't they design it so you just have to push the lever forward and then let you push the seat forward?  That's the way it is on my Mustang.

2. Is the manual windows roller backwards?  I haven't had a car with manual windows in a while so I may be wrong, but the direction seems backwards that you need to turn to lower and raise the window.

3. The keyhole cover for the trunk is made of rubber and held in place with an adhesive.  Well 3 months later, someone has stolen the rubber piece.  Why did Ford choose to use rubber piece instead of using the same style of hard rubber like the keyhole for the side doors?  In future models, I would like to see the soft rubber piece changed to a more permanent method that makes it harder for the car to be vandalized.
