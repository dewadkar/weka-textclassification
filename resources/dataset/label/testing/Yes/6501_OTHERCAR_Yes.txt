            I think this is by far the best digital camera that I've used. The LCD screen is great for reviewing the picture that you've just taken. So you know whether or not you need to retake that certain picture. I love the date/time stamp option on it as well. I don't know how many times I've looked at older pictures and wondered "Now when was that taken?" With the Kodak DX3600, you don't have to question it, because it's all date stamped on the corner of your picture. The Video recorder is definitely an added bonus. It's great for those short movies, of say... watching your child blow out those 1st birthday candles. I bought a compact Flash card with mine and I can't get over how easy it is to download all the pictures in just seconds. The Kodak Software that comes with it, is just amazing. I can crop, rotate, lighten and print out Professional looking photographs within minutes. I would definitely recommend this digital camera to anyone. Especially if your looking for something that's easy to use, but that produces pictures that look great on that first shot.
