            I should clarify that I got this as a rental. I didn't ask for it, but they had already given away the standard full size car I wanted. So they &quot;upgraded&quot; me to the town car. I think it's called the Town Car because you could fit the population of a small town inside it. As big as it is, I thought it would be unmanuverable and slow. It's not. It accelerates quickly, but the only way I knew was to look at the speedometer. You can't feel a thing in this car. Driving a Town Car is a lot like sitting on a plush, comfy couch while playing a really good driving simulator on a computer. The seats are amazingly comfortable, and the car has less engine/road noise than any vehicle I have ever seen. There is no feedback from the road and the steering is incredibly sensitive. I kept wandering in the lane because the slightest pressure on the wheel and the car changes direction. Inattention could be disasterous because the first warning that you have turned would be the crunch of the bumper.

<b>Man that's big....</b>
 Not that hitting a guardrail would harm you. The bumper is waaay at the front of the car. Outside of a heavy truck I can't think of many vehicles that would be safer than this one. Besides the normal complement of air bags, it also has a warning light that bongs! at you if the driver hasn't buckled the seat belt. If I owned this car that would be the first fuse to come out. It doesn't easily fit into parking spaces. Six people could easily ride in it and the trunk is large enough to sleep two. But it doesn't look bad. The styling is very nice, and it's a very comfortable car in all respects. Surprisingly for such a big car, it still gets about 20MPG in mixed driving. Not great, but I was expecting faster fuel consumption....

<b>How do I?....</b>
Everything in this car is powered. The seat &quot;remembers&quot; your settings and when you stop the car it pulls back to allow you to get out easier. When you start the car it slides you to your preferred position. The seat controls are extensive and far easier to use than in my Grand Prix. The button is shaped like a seat and you just push it in the direction you want to go. The gas and trunk buttons are right there on the door. There is also a very useful display near the speedometer that shows your current direction, fuel mileage, ect. Radio and climate control buttons are provided on the steering wheel, but there isn't enough of them to control either adequately. There are so many buttons it takes time to figure them all out. I figured the climate control out, and in Atlanta A/C is important. Driver storage space is excellent. There is a fold down armrest with plenty of space and there is a small map compartment in the door armrest. 

This is a nice luxury car that really pampers you. If you want to really feel your driving, look elsewhere. <br><br>
