            &quot;Isn't that car a killer?&quot;

&quot;Isn't it, though? Some really clean curves.&quot;

&quot;No. I mean, weren't all the TTs recalled?&quot;

&quot;Oh. That. Over 200 accidents and two deaths. Yeah, Audi wants it back.&quot; I press a button on my key fob. The signal lights flash in unison. &quot;But I'm not surrendering mine to the dealer. The safety modifications involve a rear spoiler that ruins the line of the car.&quot;

&quot;Aren't you worried about becoming a statistic?&quot;

&quot;The car only tends to lose control if you drive at extreme speeds and brake hard in a turn. So I figure I'm fine as long as I don't slow down.&quot; I shrug. &quot;Besides, the recall only increases the resale value.&quot;

&quot;But it's a death trap.&quot;

&quot;People are attracted to death. It's a very rare and beautiful death trap.&quot; I swing open the door. &quot;After all, coming face-to-face with your own mortality doesn't come cheap.&quot;


The 2000 Audi TT Quattro Coupe. 1.8 liters, 4 cylinders, 180 horsepower. From the racing-style gas cap to the dimpled aluminum rings around the interior vents that turn to regulate air flow, it's all about the details. Because it's what moves you.
