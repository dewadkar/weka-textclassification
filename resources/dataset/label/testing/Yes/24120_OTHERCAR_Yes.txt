            I purchased a used Town Car from a Ford dealership. The car was previously a rental vehicle, two years old, with 25,000 miles. I have had outstanding service from the car; only scheduled maintenance needed and replacement of tires. No breakdowns, all parts still working. After two additional years, I have 92,000 miles on odometer and expect to keep car an additional two years. Long trips of over 500 miles per day are no problem, the car rides well, handles well, meets speed limits without a problem, even in mountainous areas. Mileage is about 17 to 20 mpg on short daily trips in city, and 20 to 23 mpg on highways at 70 plus mph.
For anyone more interested in a luxury car that does not require a new car every year or so, a used luxury car is the best decision.<br><br>
