            This car is great for hauling people or stuff. It gets great gas mileage, and it looks pretty good too (for a station wagon.)
 I bought one of these about 3 years ago and was wonder how other people felt about it. No one has written anything, so here's what's up if you're looking at one.
Bad Stuff:
1) I live in Florida so there's lots of traffic. Parking places are not easy to find a lot of the time, and parking the car can be a little tricky. Not much of a problem
2) The accelerator is a little weak, but c'mon. It's a staion wagon.
3) Visibility isn't exactly top notch. However, I'm not blind in it at all.
Good stuff:
1) TONS OF ROOM! If you need to carry stuff, this is the car for you.
2) Lasts forever. I've had this car for several years now and it hasn't had many problems at all. Replaced the wipers a couple of times, but that's normal.
3) SAFE!!! I let my daughter borrow this once....and yes....she hit a pole. She came out totally unscathed and the car needed little repair work done.
