               Man, who ever they had design this thing, they've never been a mechanic! I'm not a pro, but when I tried to replace the starter, I simpley could not do it! My 87' 4-door model is not a small car. It's pretty average size really, but the engin is surrounded by the resat of your equipment, that you can't reach a thing without dismantleing the rest.
   Be-sides the engin though, the car is great. The brakes are very trust worthy, the handling is nice, and the gauges rarely break. Realy this is a nice vehicle. 
   I can carry 5 people very comfortabley. Trunk space is to match. All round over the shoulder saftey belts are very nice, I don't want to be responsable for my friends dying. 
   Over all, this is a cheap, nice cruiser that searves me well for a first car. I got mine for $400 dollars at the auction.<br><br>
