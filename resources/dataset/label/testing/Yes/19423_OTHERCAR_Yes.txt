             I recently traded in a 1988 4.0 Jeep Cherokee for 1999 Honda CR-V. It is an improvement in all but 1 area. Power. That, however, it not a big deal at the moment. 
 The CR-V has a better seating position. More precise handling. Is very good in the snow. Got to try it in over 2 feet of snow shortly after we got it and it did wonderfull. Very comfortable on the highway. 
 I have seen some reviews that say it is noisy at highway speeds. I suppose it may be if compared to a sedan. I find it quiet. 
 The CR-V has more usable room in it than the Cherokee and possibly even the Grand Cherokee. Part of this is due to the cherokees having the spare inside the rear cargo area.
 My CR-V has the Honda Real-Time 4wd. It works seamlessly. While it is not on par with a true 4WD system it is more than adequit for even light/moderate trail usage. the real limitation on off road use may prove to be lift/tire options. As the CR-V is based on the Civic platform it does not lend itself well to things such as lift kits. I have seen 2" spring lifts available which will allow larger tires, but you can only go up a relatively small amount in tire size. I have to add though that the CR-V really was not designed to compete in the off road arena. it does however beat all comers in the everyday family vehicle area. 
 Entry and exit are easy. The seperate lift gate and tail gate ensure ease of use at the rear. There are numerous storage areas in the CR-V, to include an area for tools in the tail gate. Another cute feature is the rear cargo floor storage area cover is also a table. thats right, it is basically a smaller version of a card table.
 All in all I would recommend the CR-V to anyone looking for a small/mid size family oriented SUV. I suppose it is in the Cherokee, Escape, even Forrester class. It has them all beat. The only time I would not recommend it is when towing more than about 1000 lbs is required.
