            If you are looking for

- Good gas milage
- Descent of the line
- Good top speed
- Awsome cornering
- Sporty looks

Then take a look at an Isuzu Impulse or Asuna Sunfire. I have been in the car going about 230km/h and was perfectly stable. Cornering at 100km/h and feel safe, yet beeing able to keep a descently comftorable ride. But the cost of a RARE repair is quite pricy!! Its worth its salt!! Considering mine has over 250 Kms (highway miles) it still runs amazing. A sub in the back sounds awsome!! With exhaust, K&amp;N, computer chip and v rated tires I can beat a 5.0 Mustang of the line and keep up with almost any mid-ranged sports car top speed (suped or not)
