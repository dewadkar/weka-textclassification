            We looked at the Toyota Sienna and the Honda Odyssey. The Toyota is very nice. But the Honda is huge on the inside. I have my own business selling books. I carry about 6 large Rubbermaid containers around. I can fit all 6 containers in the back. I can do this without putting the back seat down. How incredible is that!!!!!!!!!! Just think if you had 5 kids no problem you would still have plenty of room. Two Passenger side doors. Talk about ease of operation. We went camping in Maine. We laid the back seat down into the trunk space. That is right the back seat does not have to be removed. We packed in a stroller, tent, two mountain bikes, pack n play and all the supplies for a week. We still had space. Basically, I love my Van.<br><br>
