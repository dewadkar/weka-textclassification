            When I turned 16 I only wanted an SUV.  That was 3 years ago, and I was looking at everything from Chevy Blazers to Jeep Cherokees.  I lucked into my Pathfinder- low miles, silver, XE model with V6, 4x4 and Automatic.  From the start I was impressed; it had a fit and finish that none of the other SUVs I test-drove had.

Three years and 15,000 miles later, it has aged little.  Everything still works: the cruise control holds speed, the radio tunes in well, and the engine can last another 100k miles.

However, with age comes illness.  The air conditioning system has been plagued with leaks, and the Freon system is expensive to repair.  The compressor may be wearing out, as it has started to whine.  The emissions canister and muffler had to be replaced.  The hydraulics on the tail gate were also replaced.  Luckily most repairs are typical of a vehicle this age, and the major components are going strong.

My biggest complaint is the weak V6 engine.  It struggles on hills and craws up mountains.  It does have a lot of low end torque, so it feels peppy and does well off-road.  The Pathfinder does have genuine off-road abilities.  It has survived the jeep trails of a local scout camp and forded large mud holes.  It also traversed snow-covered roads without a problem.

The Pathfinder is one of the best values on the SUV market, and even the earliest models continue to be in high demand.

*UPDATE: June 10, 2002*
My truck just hit 110,000 miles.  It's doing great, but still has a few minor problems.  A small fender-bender in January cost around $2000 to repair, but the truck held up well in the accident.  However, I've had some suspension problems since.  (I'm not sure if they're a result of the accident or not.)  One of the struts seems to be on its way out, and wheel alignment is terrible.  The A/C Compressor hasn't died yet, but I'm not using it-- it makes a horrible whine.  The engine is also whining over 4000 RPMs-- not its redline either.  I've had the truck now for almost 4 years, and am ready for a new one.  It's still a great truck and I would highly recommend it.
