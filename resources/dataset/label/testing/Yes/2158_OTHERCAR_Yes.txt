            I purchased a 94 Rodeo with 45,000 miles on it in July of 1998. I am a tall
guy and thought the extra room would be just what the doctor ordered for the
long legs. Also, the winters in Minneapolis can be painful without the
luxury of 4WD.

Fourteen months later I have this to say:

This truck is solid. I haven't had to do much other than routine
maintenance. On the down side, parts seem to be extremely expensive when
they are needed (3 belts total around $100). I don't mind spending a few
extra bucks up front to avoid the alternator or tranny going though!

The power is great. It can get up and go when it needs to (V6). The 4WD
pulled me out of several parking lots this past winter that I could still be
in otherwise. I have put 20,000 miles on the truck since then, and it is
holding just fine. Speaking of miles, the MPG averages around 18-22 for
city driving...a bit less in 4WD.

The &quot;feel&quot; is not that of a Mustang or Accord, but better than some SUV's I
have driven. It holds the road nice, and I love the feeling of &quot;elevation&quot;
over cars. It is an added bonus that you can see the idiot driver changing
lanes blindly over the top of the car in front of you. That has actually
save me an accident this month!

No issues with the paint chipping/peeling! In fact, it still looks real
nice after 5 Minnesota winters (1 with me). That is tough with all the salt
and sand that goes on the roads here.

All in all the 94 Rodeo is a nice truck for someone who doesn't want to drop
30K on a ride. I have been watching the blue book values, and it seems to
hold fairly well. I suppose I can add re-sale information if I ever sell
the things...which I doubt!
