            My husband and I bought a used 1993 Saturn Sc2 about a year ago. The former owner had  destroyed the transmission, so my husband found a used one online and replaced it himself. I was very suprised when I first drove this car. It handles tight around curves and hugs the road so well. It is very easy to speed in this car. I love driving it. I can't believe the get up and go it has. Usually I am squeamish about passing people. Not with this car. You hit the pedal and zoom...you pass them without any jerky motions or roaring of the engine. It has great pickup and smooth control. The front seats are very comfortable and hug your body. I do admit that for heavy set people I don't think that this car would be very comfortable. There is a lot of leg room in the front seat but not alot for the back seat. It also doesn't have a lot of head room. So if you are over 6'0 tall....you might have problems. It gets pretty good gas mileage, for a sports car. About 26  miles to the gallon. More on the freeway. The overdrive button is awesome.  This car is fun and sporty and definitley cool to drive. There are a few things that do bug me. It is very low to the ground so it is uncomfortable for pregnant women to get in and out of. Also, putting in carseats is a pain. I also am not happy about the middle section of the back seat where there are cup holders instead of a third seat.( We had to purchase a mini-van recently so all of our children (3) could go places with both of us) Also, I want to mention that the automatic door belts when not attached come down anyway and can give you a nasty gash on the head if not paying attention. The ashtray in the 93 model is in a really weird spot and not a convience at all. It is in front of the floor shift and it is just not normal place for an ashtray. It does have a good size trunk and can be accessed through the back seat which is cool. The tires are pretty easy to change.A great car to drive if single or if you have older children. Leather seats are easy to clean also. A great car with a few inconviences.<br><br>
