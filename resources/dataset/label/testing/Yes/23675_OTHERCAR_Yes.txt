            I was not in the market for a new car but in July I had someone slam into the back of my Mazda 626 while going 50 miles per hour. After being pushed across two lanes of oncoming traffic and into a phone booth in a parking lot, my wonderful little Mazda was destroyed. After dealing with the insurance companies and the idiot who rammed into me, I started looking for a new car. 

I looked at the 2002 Mazdas and didn't really care for them. Looked at Toyota, Honda, Saturn, and Chevrolet and nothing really caught my eye. Then my boyfriend recommended I take a look at the Chrysler PT Cruiser "just for the heck of it." I was doubtful about this choice, but was running out of options that I could afford and I was going to look at the Chrysler Sebring Convertible anyway, so I decided to try the Cruiser as well. Best decision I ever made!

My 2002 PT Cruiser is the cherry red color (some people call it candy apple red) and is a head turner on almost every street and parking lot in my neighborhood. The front seats are extremely comfortable and I have the automatic height adjustment option on the driver's seat which definitely helps to make the car more driveable for me (I'm only 5'4"). The map pockets on the doors are very large and hold all sorts of things, though I have to say that they do jut out a little too far. If you're a big person, you might find that you are bumping your legs on the map pockets. 

There is also a CD storage drawer under the front passenger seat, but I must say that Chrysler got a little lazy on this feature. The concept is terrific, but the implementation is not so great. The plastic is cheap and it does not pull out smoothly. The first time I tried to open the drawer it was very stiff and it jerked out, nearly knocking me off of my feet. I put CDs into the drawer and closed it. The next time I went to open the drawer, I had to use all my strength to pull the drawer open and when it did finally fly open, my CDs went flying! I don't close the drawer tightly anymore because I don't want to have to keep picking up my CDs.

The center panel controls (windows, heat, air conditioning, etc.) are well-arranged though I must say that after driving this car for five months, I still find my hand going to the door to press the button to roll down the window. It takes a long time getting used to having the interior controls in the center panel. The air conditioning and heating system is very responsive, takes almost no time to heat or cool the interior of the car. The automatic windows go up and down smoothly and quickly. 

The controls on the wheel are pretty good. The cruise control is easy to operate and works very well. The headlights, though, are something of another story. The first time I drove the car at night, I turned the headlights on and realized that the high beams were activated. For the life of me, I could not figure out how to turn them off. I ended up pulling to the side of the road and pulling out the driver's manual. Even with the manual, it took me another 10 minutes to figure the lights out. The car not only has parking lights, but also "parade lights" and the light-control stick on the wheel is very confusing. I've gotten used to it, but I still don't like it very much.

The AM/FM radio, cassette player and single CD player work wonderfully and sound terrific on the six speakers. (My neighbors will attest to this fact as I zip down the street blasting Rosemary Clooney's Mambo Italiano on the CD player!)

The 5-speed standard shift is very responsive and I would recommend the standard shift over the automatic transmission. When I test drove the car it was an automatic and I was underwhelmed by the responsiveness of the car, especially when trying to merge onto the highway. But the standard shift transmission is much more responsive, and frankly, this car screams out for a standard shift and not an automatic transmission. It's part of the Cruiser experience!

The rear seats are very comfortable and roomy. Chrysler does say that three adults fit in the back seat. If it's a short drive, that would be okay. If you are on a road trip, I would not recommend three adults sit in the back seat because that would probably get uncomfortable fairly quickly. The rear seats go down flat in a 65/35 configuration which is extremely handy if you need to transport large items (the curio cabinet we purchased fit perfectly in the car).

The "flip-up" hatch that gets you into the trunk of the car goes up very smoothly and easily. I must say, though, that if you are short like I am you might have to stand on tip-toe to grasp the hatch and pull it down to close. The trunk is very spacious and the tail-gate tray/table that comes in the back is very, very handy. It has hooks on it to hang bags so that your food shopping bags never go sliding around your trunk again... fabulous!

I knew that my gas mileage with the Cruiser was not going to be as good as my Mazda and I was right. I've been getting an average of 18 or 19 MPH (city and highway). This is my major complaint about this car but since I knew that going into the purchase, I'm not really complaining. It's not marketed as a gas-saver and that's okay.

Bottom line? I love this car and am so glad that my boyfriend suggested I try it. The first couple of months of driving this car, I had to get used to people staring at it as I drove down the street or parked it at the office. The first day I drove the Cruiser to the office, I came out of the building at the end of the day to find six or seven people standing around the car and ended up giving some of them a ride! I've also had strangers grill me with questions about it at stoplights and in parking lots... even had a woman offer to buy it from me at the veterinarian's office!
