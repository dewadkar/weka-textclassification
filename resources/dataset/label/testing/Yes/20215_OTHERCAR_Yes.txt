            I looked at the similar cars (Ford Taurus, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima) and chose the Malibu strictly on price.  Brand new, it was $2000-$3500 cheaper then any of those when comparably equipped (V6, ABS, am/fm/cd/cass etc).

The first year of ownership was basically trouble free.  I did have the problem with the brake rotors warping at around 15,000 miles but that was fixed under warranty.  It came back around 25,000 miles and Chevy again replaced the front brake rotors and pads at no charge.  They said that a new design rotor was used and so far so good.

Only 1 time did I get stranded with the car when the alternator quit at around 28,000 miles.  Luckily I was 2 blocks from my house when it happened.  Chevy replaced the alternator and the battery under the 3yr/36,000 mile warranty.

I have had is that the A/C fan control head has had to be replaced 3 times.  Twice because the fan stopped working on speeds 1-2.  The other was because the A/C would not stay on when the button was pressed.  This was covered by the warranty each time.

One real problem that bothers me is the engine noise.  I'm talking about the tapping from the engine on cold starts.
Chevy says that it is caused by "piston slap" and is not detrimental to the engine.  They have a Technical Service Bulletin on that problem.  My dealer advised against having the work done as on the few cars that they did repair work
on per the bulletin, the owners have complained that it came
back after a few thousand miles.  

Other than those minor annoyances I can't complain about the car.  It has a smooth ride, good acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6 and plenty of room.
