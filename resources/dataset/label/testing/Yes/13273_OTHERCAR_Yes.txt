            Honda has a big problem - its bread and butter Accord is a legitimate competitor for their high buck Acura nameplate!  I bought a 1999 4 door Accord EX-V6 (Leather) a year ago after also test driving an Acura 3.2 TL, a Toyota Camry and a Lexus 300ES.  While all were nice cars, the Accord was the only choice for me when I weighed design, cost and value.  I really appreciate the interior, which I find to be exceptionally clean and well laid out.  It looks and feels more roomy than its Acura cousin, the 3.2TL, which I thought was a bit cramped and gimmicky. I especially like the dash and the audio/climate controls, which are well positioned and intuitive to use.  At first the steering wheel seemed a bit low, but now that I'm used to it I like it.  The car is well assembled, no rattles,  squeaks or wind leaks, and not a single problem after 1 year and 14,000 miles.  The V6 engine is strong, smooth, and quiet, averaging about 24 MPG in mostly city driving (29 on trips).  The headlights are excellent, with a beam pattern and throw as good as any I've seen. Another plus - the heater warms fast, important in northern climates.  Gripes are few: The ride is a tad firm, and the factory speakers supplied with the otherwise fine AM/FM/CD were pathetic.  Luckily, it was a breeze to replace them with after-market upgrades.  The car is roomy in front but three adults are cozy in back.  All in all, a great car.<br><br>
