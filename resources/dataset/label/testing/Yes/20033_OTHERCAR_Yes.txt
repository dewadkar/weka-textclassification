            This car is a cheap, reliable.  Good for a student.

I bought this car when it had 45k miles on it and sold it when it got 95k miles.  I didn't have to do any kind of major fixing on this car except the usual maintenance.

I have traveled lots of places in this car and never had road problems.  One of my last trips was from Des Moines to Las Vegas.  I had no troubles except for going up those steep hills in Rocky Mountains.

I sold this car because I started having problems with the front axcel.  Instead of replacing the axcel I decided to trade it in for another car.

From my experience I never had problems with this car.  I would recommend this car mostly to students since I didn't find it too stylish or luxury enough for when you get a real job.

This car is no Lexus, but it is cheap and will get you were you are going with no problems.<br><br>
