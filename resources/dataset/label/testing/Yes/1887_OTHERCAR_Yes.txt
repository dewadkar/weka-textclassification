            My wife and I got this camera to replace our aging point and shoot 1.3 MP digital camera with no zoom.  With a baby on the way, it was the perfect excuse.  With much planning and mulling over features, price, and convenience we decided on the HP 850-

The camera is very easy to use, but has a few extra features that will please even an advanced user.  You have the option of changing exposure modes, ISO speeds, white balance, and some other settings that are usually left out of other cameras.  For the most part, the camera performs well on its 'auto' settings, but these features are available to make your shots more customizable. 

At 4.3 MP, the camera takes great shots, even at its lower resolution setting (it has 2- 1.3 MP and 4.3 MP).  At each setting you can choose the level f .jpg compression you want as well- 1, 2, or 3.  The included Secure Digital Media Card is 16MB, which is good to play around with, but you'll want to get a 64 MB card (at least) if you want to do some serious snapping.  Only 13 pictures will fit on the 16 MB card (4.3MP at medium compression). At lowest compression you will only get 7 pics on there.

The video feature is really neat and easy to use.  You can even include sound clips with stationary images if you set it up to do that.  The only bad part is when you zoom in video mode, the lens motor is really noisy since it is right by the speaker.

The only bad points to the camera are that it is impossible to catch any action shots because of the way the zoom lens works.  You have to hold down the shutter button halfway for a second to focus on the subject before you can click, otherwise you get blurry shots.  The camera is also not very convenient to carry around because of its size.  It is a great porrait camera, and takes awesome shots, but not a good vacation camera, as you will tend to leave it in your hotel room rather than carry around a bag full of camera.

We have taken several of our pictures on disc to Sams Club to have them developed on film, and you can't even tell they were taken with a digital.  Our family on the other side of the country appreciates the hard copies :)
