            A camera is used to capture images which can be reviewed at a later date.  Knowing this, I'm glad i purchased the Cyber Shot U30 from Sony.

First and foremost, this is a very basic point and shoot camera with no zoom.  Yes, there are better cameras out there with higher res, zoom this, hi tech that, movie mode this, but if it's big, heavy or doesn't fit in your pocket or wrap around your neck you'll likely leave it home.  This is why i bought the sony u30, the accessory camera.  

How small you say, it's 85 x 40.3 x 29.7mm, about the size of a small cell phone, and a lot lighter too, weighing in  at 123g.  Because of these factors, this camera goes where ever I go.  This way I'll never have to say, "I wish I had a camera with me".    

Another thing I like is this camera takes standard batteries!  This might sound silly to your, but this is a big plus in by books.  Say your traveling aboard and your camera goes low?  What do you do?  If your camera takes proprietary batteries you'll have to go home to charge them, however, in my case I can go to a local store and buy a pack of AAA batteries or use cheap AAA rechargeables. So buy at least two sets if your planning to travel.  (Hint:  go on ebay aaa batteries, I bought 12 for 9 dollars US)

Picture quality, how does it fair.  Well being a former owner of the canon digital elps I can honestly say it's about the same, for developing 4 by 6 prints.  However, if your planning on printing poster size images stay away from this camera since it's CDD lens is rated at 2 megapixel.  So far so good for my developed pictures, nice color, and great lighting.  However, nights shots where way underdeveloped since the U30 flashed is only good for 6 feet.

What I didn't like about this camera, poor battery life, and its lack of compression options.  Maybe I have the screen on too much or something, but I feel a camera should last at least 2 hours without the low battery signal blinking.  (To improve power consumption avoid using the flash and the screens back light) Also this unit should have different levels of compression which would improve image quality a lot.

So if you want a everyday camera that looks good, print decent 4 by 6 prints, this units for you.  To me, the best camera is the one you use, not the one that stays home.
