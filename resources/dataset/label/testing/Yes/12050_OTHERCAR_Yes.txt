            I recently sold my 1999 Lexus GS 400, in hope of buying a new sports car. I originally planned on buying a 2001 SC 430, but as soon as I got a glimpse of the price tag, I said forget it. Over $60,000 for a sports car that's only a fraction larger than the miata. So, I looked at alternative options. I went by my Honda dealer nearby, and I had heard of this new sports car, the S2000. I was curious, so I asked the dealership if they could show me one. The second I saw it, I new I needed one. This car is beautiful. The front end is just curved enough over the wheelbase so that you get the feel of that down to the ground impression. The xenon headlights were also a plus, since I think that every new car should have mandatory xenon bulbs. Also, the standard 17" tires are a great addition. The rims, also beautiful, have a patented "rim lock" on them so that if a thief wanted to steal your tires, and/or rims, they couldn't do so without the key, which I thought was ingenious, since somebody stole two of my wheels when I had my Lexus. 

Anyways, when I test drove one, I instantly fell in love with the road handling capabilities. With .94 g's, and independent shocks, this baby can take turns at speeds you wouldn't even think of in any other car. Also, the interior is simply, yet efficiently set up so the driver has the entire climate, comfort, and music controls at the tips of his fingers. 

Also, I've never driven a six speed, or any other stick shift vehicle that has a transmission as smooth as the S2000. Honda developed a transmission so smooth on this car that the driver doesn't have even think about shifting. It actually feels like butter when changing gears in this car. And with a 240 HP inline 4, this baby hauls it, and hauls it quick. 

There isn't much negativity when it comes to Honda's new S2000 model sports car. All I have to complain about is the small interior, but other than that, this car is sure to turn heads.
