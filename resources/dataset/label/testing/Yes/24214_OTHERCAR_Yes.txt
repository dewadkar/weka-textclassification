            I have owned several cars in my lifetime, ranging from the gas gulping late '60s muscle cars to the slirping 4 bangers of the mid '80s. What I have found, is that the muscle cars get old quick, and the economy cars are way too un-cool. Think about it, how often can you really put the pedal to the floor with your 440 hemmy in a 68 charger? Certainly never legally, and whats the use? You can feel the excitement of all that horse power shooting you off from the stoplight like a cannon. That gets old soon though. Then you realize you are filling up your tank 5 times a day, with that high octane crap at 2.50 dollars a gallon. Then you get a 4 cylinder honda. It is so ugly, and so incredibly slow and boring, that you nearly fall asleep at the wheel. The only thing keeping you awake are the laughs as other drivers pass you by. What can you do about this dillema?? Simple, buy a Camaro. I purchased a 1991 Camaro very recently, and I absolutely love this car. Number one, it looks cool. Number too, it handles like a dream. Taking corners at 45 miles per hour is definitely a fun rush. Number three, it won't suck down gas like there is no tomorrow, at least mine doesn't. I guess if you were to put a huge 400 or something like that into it it would, but with my 305, the car is very peppy. Comfort is another great thing about this car. Anyone who has owned a pre-1975 car knows what that's like. Undependable at best, with out all those creature comforts like air conditioning, power steering, cd player, power windows/locks, even cupholders. This car has all these things, and more. So if you want comfort, coolness, and practicality all in one package, buy yourself a Camaro. 3rd generations ('82-92) are great, personally I think the 4th generation camaros are a little cooler looking, but be prepared to shell out over 10 grand for one. I got mine for 3800 with 88000 miles on it from a dealership at wholesale price. Without the wholesale, you can snatch up a 3rd gen Camaro for anywhere from 5-10 thousand. A great deal for such a cool car.
