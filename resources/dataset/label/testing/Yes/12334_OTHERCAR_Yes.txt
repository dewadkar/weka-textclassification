            With the Mitsubishi &quot;geo-mechanical&quot; styling, the 2000 Eclipse coupe dispenses with turbocharger power, available all-wheel drive and five trim levels in favor of two engines in three front-drive models. The base RS and mid-range GS carry a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, while the top-line GT becomes the first V6 Eclipse with a powerplant of a 3.0 liter. Both engines are related to those offered in Mitsubishi's Galant and have an optional automatic transmission or in low-emission-vehicle tune than the standard manual-shift versions. Against previous Eclipse's, the new ones are 2 inches longer in wheelbase, 3 inches longer overall, nearly a half-inch wider, and almost 2 inches taller. These key feature increase 0.6-inch to rear headroom, 1.6 inches to rear legroom, and 0.3 cubic feet to cargo space. Along with a killer suspension and a powerplant for an engine it comes standard with features like: alloy wheels, air conditioning, AM/FM/CD stereo, power windows and door locks, and an engine security shut off built into the ignition key. The GS adds 16-inch wheels (versus 15s), power mirrors, cruise control, remote keyless entry, and other goodies. The GT comes with 17-inch wheels, lowering ground effects, and rear disc brakes instead of drums. It also offers side airbags in a Premium Package option that includes leather, power driver's seat and antilock brakes. For what the Eclipse cost, and what you get out of it, a great sports car, and with all the luxury you need, it is the #1 sports car of the millenium!<br><br>
