            Any persons who may be concerned about the competitiveness of the U.S. auto manufacturers in the world market need only visit the industrially rich and irrigationally fortified state of Michigan. Where some other areas of the country are well saturated with the best from Europe and Asia, Michigan seems a bit slow to catch on. Ford, GM, and Chrysler products inundate the landscape strangling out the light cast from highly viable Toyota and BMW offerings. My initial concerns over the marketability of the recently released 2002 Explorer, for example, have been sufficiently quelled as I passed almost 60 of them during my highway travels through the Wolverine State. Sure, the �exotics� were here and there, but mostly, it was American all the way. 

 Instead of some place far and exciting, we decided that a simple, relaxing trip to my parents-in-law's lakeside summerhouse in Michigan would be the ideal vacation this summer. The scenery is beautiful, the total cost very low, and the best part was that the house did not have a telephone.  I dislike the service (and lack of control over your own destiny) associated with air travel plus, I consider time behind the wheel a vacation unto its own. Therefore, I was able to convince my wife to rent a comfortable car and make the 12-hour trip by road. My wife�s sister and her husband served as traveling companions.
Do you have all of the facts? One car, four adults, a weeks worth of luggage, and 12 hours. Good, because there will be a test at the end.

As far as rental cars were concerned, I wanted an inexpensive, comfortable car with enough power to meet our needs (remember the equation?) and make the trip slightly interesting for me, the driver. My search lead me to the Buick Century. My experience with Buicks had been rather limited until that point. My mother had a striking tan over cr�am 1985 Century that she adored. However, with four cylinders producing only 92 horsepower, the 2658 pound Century crawled to 60, buzzing and moaning, on its hands and knees in almost 14 seconds. In addition, as it possessed a Roger Smith era, three speed automatic; it had transmission troubles by the 70k mile mark. I have also logged some drive time behind the wheel of my father-in-law�s 1992 Buick Skylark. This vehicle, though suffered from the exact opposite problems that the Century did. Its 3.3-liter V6 hustled you from a standing start with almost the gusto of a six cylinder Camaro. However, unlike the clean flanks of the Century, this car had severe styling and ergonomic problems. Add to this the fact that Buick has long been known as a purveyor of cars of the pre-war generation, and I was expecting to be even further unimpressed. I was not though. So pleased was I with the performance of the Century, that while on vacation, I dropped by a local Buick dealer and took a comprehensive look at its close, uptown sister, the Regal. As a potential buyer on a Buick lot will be confronted with each model side by side, I shall discuss my impressions of both cars in this article.

The Century has been a staple of the Buick line almost since the beginning, though it did take a brief hiatus during the Second World War and then again in the 1960�s.  The Century first hit its stride in the 1950�s, featuring a trim, intermediate body, but with a premium engine like the one used in the Roadmaster. Then in the 1970�s, the Century took on GM�s successful �Colonnade� styling theme. It was here that the Regal was born, as a premium Century.  In 1977, the Century was downsized along with much of the GM lines. For 1978, another new Century arrived, with new body styles and some 600 pounds missing. Wagon, sedan, and a strange hatchback variation were offered. It was this year that the Regal became a separate line. The following year the Regal received a dedicated coupe body style, making it more of a junior Riviera, than an up level family car. In the early eighties, the Century was recast with GM�s new corporate wide, front drive, A-body platform along with the new Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, Chevrolet Celebrity, and Pontiac 6000 models. The Regal finally made the move to front wheel drive for the 1988 model year and was joined by a four-door model once more, for 91�. For 1997, after nearly two million Century�s sold, the old A-body was retired and replaced by an very modern car, built off of the new W-body platform, which also sees duty in the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue. For 1998, the Regal was made over much in a similar way.

One important piece to remember throughout this article is that the Century has, in the last twenty years, cast itself as a practical motoring value with an average owner age of 67. The Regal�s is slightly lower, but what is valuable to note is that Buick has unashamedly embraced this notion, as it has given them much success and left them with little competition. Thusly, these two models have been deliberately designed with this sort of buying demographic in mind. I evaluate cars based on their concept, and more importantly, how well they fulfill it, and how appropriate it is to the market. If I did not entertain this line of thinking, then there would be little to stop me from criticizing the Regal�s performance as less than that of a similarly priced Chevrolet Camaro. That said, when I approve these two offerings, just as I would with any other car, it is because, in my opinion, their purpose in life is valid, and for what they are and are supposed to be, they are well done. In some cases, this one being somewhat of an example, the cars in question even offer buyers a little more than they bargained for.

Though the Regal and Century share a great deal of componentry, they are very different cars in many ways. When two models are compelled to share so much, designers often simply juggle hack-kneed bits and pieces around the body simply to give variance in the two cars appearance � take the way the Mercury Sable is consistently handled, for example. The second model often gets the stylistic scraps. Buick designers, though, have done a wonderful job of applying elements that allow for very individual and appropriate personalities. So well was it done, that you really cannot tell which car came first. The nose was a good place for Buick to begin. For the 1986 model year, the Century took on a concave nose that was rather 7 or 6 Series BMW in flavor. This theme has remained with the Century (and was applied to other Buicks as well) ever since and is now more of a Buick trademark than a BMW one. In the new Century, less angular, aerodynamic approach is taken, but the simple, classy ovalish grill tucks under, in a unique tribute to its ancestry. With the more overtly sporty Regal, the grill slants back, flowing from the bumper up into the hood. Also, the Regal�s bumper features a more prominent apron with more pronounced air intake, flanked by foglamps.  The Century features subtle, tastefully applied, chrome trim strips that begin on either side of the front license plate holder and encircle the car through the mid body rub strip and rear bumper. The application is positioned in a very traditional way, but the accuracy of the execution and sheer slender delicacy of the chrome (a mere half inch high), lends a very modern, quality appeal, while not alienating more traditionally minded buyers. The Regal attacks the mid body quagmire with different but equal success. The chrome strip is even narrower and is relocated about eight inches south. It helps to define a break point where uncharacteristically modern, optional accent tone paint is applied. The rub strip then takes on a more modern, rounded appearance and is complimented by similar accents at all four corners. The Regal also has more pronounced, chrome, dual exhaust tips. Further emphasizing the modern, sportiness are stunning, matte or chrome alloy wheels, allowing for enough negative space to clearly see the brake systems. Available on the GS model that I drove, these snazzy rims, (and even the standard units available on the entry level LS) are wide, giving the car an aggressive stance and attractive wheel/body relationship. The Century gets by on slightly smaller 15 inchers, with plastic wheel covers, or optional $325, 15-inch rims (though they look a bit like plastic wheel covers). Both cars have �Buick� script stamped into the center of the rear bumper. On the Century, though, the letters are rendered in chrome. With the Regal, a monochromatic approach is taken. This carries over to the blacked out grill as well.

The styling differences mostly end there. Both feature the same raked appearance with gentle upper body creasing that breaks over at the �C� pillar into a tidy, tucked in tail. This style is similar to what the Camry attempted to accomplish, but as Buick stylists gave the compound curve no other upper body creasing to compete with, the look is carried off quite successfully. A terrific stylized oval theme permeates the car through the clear lense headlamps, mirrors, door handles and taillights. The cars are attractive and any angle, but in some colors, the monochrome Regal is simply stunning. The trunk drew mixed reviews. The hinge design is one of those great new ones that do not eat into interior space in the trunk when closed. There is also a handy pull-down strap, though the height of the trunks rear fascia means that you can only pull with it for the first ten inches before you have to switch to the more traditional method of pushing down on the outside of the lid. When the lid is open, as with most cars, the bottom side of the tail lamps is exposed where the license plate area cuts in. It is here where you can see a problem. The space on either side of the license plate lamps is wide open. You can actually get a few fingers up inside the rear tail lamp assembly. Not only does this look cheap, but also I find it difficult to believe that the assembly is very water resistant.

The interiors of both cars are similarly pleasing environments. The Century used subtly colorful cloth upholstery and featured a bench front seat with fold down center armrest, complete with storage and cup holders. The Regal utilized buckets in the front with sportier, open centered head rests, wrapped in very soft leather. The seats felt similarly comfortable in both cars, though the Regal had a more appropriate amount of side bolstering in the front seats. Headrests in both cars were of an ideal height, hitting the back of my head perfectly. Interior door panels were the same in both cars, being very tasteful and functional. My only complaint here though is the �gathered leather� door inserts. I see what they were trying to do, and carried off successfully, this treatment looks great. But in the Buicks, the gathering was uneven and the poor graining revealed itself as cheap vinyl. Instrumentation was unique and purposeful. Buick�s classy cowl theme is employed, but tailored for a personal car and driver relationship. This is especially true in the Regal where controls feel tuned to the driver. The Regal�s center console smoothly flows into the lower dash. The shift lever, though, employs a leathery shift boot that makes it difficult to relate the position of the shifter with the indicator beneath it. I wish GM would stop using this feature in its cars. I would recommend opting for the leather wrapped steering wheel, as the one on the Regal was much better than the standard wheel in the Century. Seams between the different sections were obvious and the rim is too thin on the top and bottom portions.

The Century had a very effective dual zone climate system. The Regal, being a higher end sister, sported the same functions only in a fully automatic arrangement, complete with digital temperature adjustment. Gauges in both cars are easy to work with, though the addition of the tachometer in the Regal seems to allow the cluster to fill out the space a little better. Stereo systems worked well too, offering terrific reception and clear sound. A further indication of the target market of these cars was the enormous clock/station display and audible tones reminding you to do everything from locking the doors to releasing the parking brake. All of the tones became maddening and since the rental agency was not courteous enough to leave the owners manual, I was never able to fully understand what the car was trying to tell me. Interior space was competitive at 56 cubic feet in front, 46 in the rear, but the car, as common with many Buicks, feels larger than it is in the cabin.

On the road, differences from other 'W' cars, and even one another were evident. Though similar independent suspensions are employed, the Buicks seem to offer a bit more road isolation. This is due in part to special rubber isolation bushings between the suspension�s sub frame and the body.  Front and rear anti roll bars are smaller in the Century and the shocks softer. The Regal LS takes it up a notch by feeling more like a touring ride, where the performance oriented GS goes even further, being calibrated for sheer buttoned down taughtness. The Century�s ride does seem a bit cushier. Unfortunately, though, handling suffers as a result. Where the Regal feels controlled in corners and under evasive maneuvers, the Century bobs and weaves a bit. High-speed stability is a little wobbly too, requiring a heavy hand to compensate for abusive crosswinds. Other than this, high speed driving is very comfortable in both cars. Even approaching triple digits, the sisters are relatively smooth, quiet, and well behaved. This silence is aided by the use of triple door seals. 

Another feature aiding in the Regal�s ability to carve out the twisties are the grippy Goodyear Eagle LS tires. The Century makes do with more ride biased General Ameri 64�s. It does not require much pushing to get the Generals to whine, but as is very important to those over 60, the tires last long and are cheap to replace. There was also a small but detectable amount of tire slap when confronted with freeway expansion joints. I was please with the sheer solidity of the Buicks overall, though the Century�s dash and floorpan did vibrate a bit over heavily broken Grand Rapids pavement. With antilock assisted disk front/drum rear brakes, 70-0 occurs in about 188 feet, which is average. Expect a bit better with the four-wheel disk setup in the Regal. Violent pedal pulsing under hard braking (a characteristic of older ABS equipped Buicks) seems to be well controlled in this application. The Regal had GM�s effective Magnasteer, variable assist steering that adjusts for ideal sensitivity at all speeds. The standard steering system on our lower end Century Custom was over boosted at low speeds, but torque steer was nearly undetectable under normal acceleration, so I was not too disappointed. At night, the headlamp pattern is solid and cornering lamps cast a terrific plot of light, exactly where you are turning.

Earlier, I classified on road behavior as relatively smooth, because when pushed, the Century�s only engine, GM�s cooperate 3.1 liter V6, revealed its low-tech roots. The 3.1, which also sees duty in the Chevrolet Malibu, is an iron engine with overhead valves, but it has been updated of late with aluminum heads and oil pan, sequential port fuel injection, and distributerless ignition. Despite these modern endowments, the six lacks the whirling smoothness of some of its newer, multi-overhead cam competitors when in the upper rev ranges under hard acceleration. Still, though, the 3.1 produces a very usable 175 horsepower (5200 rpm�s) and 195 pound feet of torque (4000 rpm�s) while still maintaining 20/30-city/highway mileage. 0-60 in the 3,344 pound Century is accomplished in an uninspired 9.1 seconds through the nearly undetectable shifts of GM�s 4T60-E, four-speed automatic. Take off is smooth and effortless, though, even with a carload of people and gear, passing power is more than ample. A quick foot can even yield a healthy chirp of the front tires from a standstill. The real money though, is in the Regal�s 3.8-liter powerplants. The standard unit makes a silky 200 horsepower. Step up to the GS model and you are privy to the blown version of this engine yielding a tarmac melting 240 horsepower and 280 pound feet of torque at a lowly 5200 and 3600 revolutions, respectively. Power comes via an Eaton 90 supercharger. This system is viewed by some as vastly superior to turbo charging because the unit is belt driven, instead of heat/pressure driven � so there is really no lag in power delivery. 

The classic 3800 Series II has been around for eons just like the 3100 and even suffers from the same technological handicaps. But unlike its smaller sister plant, this motor has more cubes on its side and millions of development miles under its belt. In addition, the Regal benefits from the premium 4T65-E transaxle (with adjustable shift points), and for 99�, the addition of a new low-reduction air cleaner and larger induction system. Around loftier limits, the 3800 feels more confident and less ragged around the edges. Also, with the supercharged GS, 0-60 comes in a mind blowing 6.6 seconds! That�s enough juice to rocket the Regal GS past any of its costlier competitors such as the Chrysler 300M, Lexus ES300, and Lincoln LS. In fact, unless you are truly proficient on a stick, the slick-shifting Regal GS will even mop the floor with Nissan�s hot rod Maxima. 

Regardless of what the word around the schoolyard may be, kids, Buick is no stranger to performance. The Saturn Yellow, 455 powered, 1970 GSX featured 510 pound feet of torque at 2800 rpm's. Not exactly Honda VTEC style, but it was good enough to return 0-60 times in the mid sixes. Yet again, stately Buick came around with one of the hottest muscle cars of all time in 1987 with the all black, turbo charged GNX, which pushed 60 down into the mid fives straight off the showroom floor. These were merely two of several examples of Buicks that could dust off all but the very hairiest of Corvettes of their era. This time, though, Buick has been able to reapply this formula to a roomy, environmentally friendly sedan that features running lights, side impact beams, dual airbags and anti-lock braking, as well as 18 to 28 mile per gallon fuel economy.  After feeling the endless V6 power and lightening quick precision of the four-speed, I feel that the GS can match wits with most any car you will typically run into on American freeways. A five-speed automatic would be nice, as it may expand on the engine�s power distribution abilities and improve highway fuel economy. For the GS, a boost gauge for the supercharger would be a nice touch, and perhaps slightly fatter exhaust tips. An even 300 horsepower would really get things going too, and while we are at it, lets package this all up and call it the Buick GNX. Oops, did I say that? 

Century�s are available in either standard �Custom� or up market �Limited� and are longer, lower, and wider than the high value, but creaky A-body it replaced. As was once commonplace at GM, the Century has always had corporate sisters that were nearly identical. But the Century is the one that out lived them all. Chevrolet�s Celebrity faded away in 1990, the Pontiac 6000 (arguably the best of the group) bowed out after 1991, and the Cutlass Ciera hung on until the end of 1996, where it was merged with the Cutlass Supreme and sold as a platform mate to the Chevrolet Malibu. Our Bright White 01� model Century Custom featured air filtration, lighted vanity visors, floor mats, cruise control, cassette player stereo, dual zone air, rear window antenna and a power driver�s seat, bringing the total sticker price to $19,500 before taxes. Regals come in two varieties as well, the entry level LS and sporty GS. The Santa Fe Red Pearl Regal GS I drove, included the Luxury package, driver info center, floor mats, power driver and passenger seats, Monsoon CD/Cassette stereo system, steering wheel mounted radios controls, Astroroof, and chromed 16 inch wheels. The dealer was asking $26,500, which, if you will remember, includes the supercharged engine. GM�s helpful Onstar system is available on both cars, as well.
 
In Michigan, where American cars are the order of the day, General Motors seems to stand out even further. I even discovered what state the ten people who bought Pontiac Azteks live in. Perhaps it was because I was driving a Century and was simply more aware of that particular car, but I ran into more Centurys than I could even keep track of. I even ran across nearly a dozen that were identical to ours. I live in the fast paced (for the south), urban bustle of Richmond, Virginia. The classically architected landscape serves as a backdrop to three basic groups: students, young professional bougoir bohemians, and the old money. In this Saturn/Jeep/Mercedes cast system, Buicks commonly find themselves relegated to the parking lots of retirement homes and churches. But the tied is turning at GM�s stodgy stepchild, Buick. Needless, counter productive models such as the Roadmaster and Skylark have been weeded out, and a new minivan/SUV has been introduced in the form of the novel Rendezvous. Quality and reliability are back and years of hunting and pecking in the studios have once again yielded hansom family styling that is uniquely and appropriately Buick.

I recommend the intermediate Buick sedans for their solid, quiet structures, comfortable rides, and rich powertrains. You will not find any over wrought body cladding, fake scoops and spoilers, or melodramatic instrumentation. All you see is a clean and classy design, that offers even more than it promises behind the wheel. Though the Century offers a terrific car for the money, I must further take my hat off to the Regal, and more specifically, the hot rod GS. Not only does this car offer all the baked in goodness of a Buick, but also it does it so with an exaggerated amount of street performance that renders a good family sedan as a stellar performance car. That considered, with the possible exception of some of its GM stable mates, the Regal GS finds itself with little real competition in this price class.
