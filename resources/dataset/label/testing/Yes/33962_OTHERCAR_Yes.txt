            I have owned my 83 505 GR for just over 2 years now. Mine was assembled in Australia by Leyland, and therefore is of a slightly different spec to the 505 GR in other markets. My car has the tweed cloth seats, front power windows, air-conditioning, radio/cassette, hydraulic height adjustment of headlights, etc. It has the venerable XN1A 2.0L pushrod engine found in various forms and sizes in all Peugeots between 1947-1990s. Mine is fitted with a single Solex carburetor and a 5spd manual gearbox. 

The Peugeot 505 is a wonderful car to drive. It has the ride quality that only the French and Jaguar could achieve. Despite having 20 year old shock absorbers it still glides over the worst of unsealed roads the Australian outback can throw at it. However, what makes these cars special is that they manage to mix this luxurious ride comfort with very nimble handling. I have driven my 505 to its very limits on twisty mountain roads, and it will always behave in a very controlled and predictable manor. Due to the soft suspension the body rolls around a lot, however this can be used advantageously to shift the weight around to assist with cornering. The full independent suspension (McPherson struts at the front and Semi-Trailing arms at the rear) combined with the long suspension travel means each wheel is always in contact with the road. This all adds up to a very secure cornering car - naturally under steering just ever so slightly; however with a careful selection of gear you can provoke a small amount of over steer. 

The steering is extremely communicative so you always know what the front wheels are doing, and know in an instant when they are loosing grip. 

So is this a luxury sedan or a smart looking European sedan with hint of sporting pedigree? 


Now the more relevant part for the year 2003 - what are these cars like to use on daily basis? In the past year I have spent AU$4000 in repairs, however none of these things were serious mechanical faults, rather all the things you'd expect to wear out on a 20 year old car have just started to. This includes both the brake and clutch master cylinders, steering flector, rear brake calipers needed to be rebuilt, refurbishing the carburetor, and so on. 

The mechanicals are so basic in this car that even a beginner can do simple maintenance when armed with the Haynes workshop manual. Parts are cheap and easy to find in Australia. I've heard it isn't so easy in the US though.

So to conclude, this old piece of French motoring history deserves a place on today&#146s roads. With regular maintenance these old things will last many more years. They are a very safe car for their age, a joy to drive, and if you can put up with the 96hp engine, go have yourself a good time.
