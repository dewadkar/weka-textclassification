            I have  few things to say about my 1998 S-10.
It is the LS, Jade Green, sport wheels, 5 speed, Tilt, cruise, AC, Nice seats,Tape player, etc.
Love:
Great ride
Great stereo
Smooth Transmission
Pretty good power for 4 cyl
Nice fit and finish to the vehicle!
Great gas mileage
Tires wear like rocks, no wear showing yet: 26,xxx miles!

Dislike:
Already creaking and groaning in the winter. Dash rattles upon acceleration. Rear springs creak when you hit a bump.
Windshield very, very fragile. Been replaced twice from small rocks that are thrown from other vehicles. I also have a 75 Ramcharger that has been stoned numerous times without a scratch.
Paint seems very thin. Rub it the wrong way with anything less than a towel and it scratches.
Metal in the bed seems to be to thin! Bed metal used to be thick so you could abuse it. I put my dirt bike in the bed and the kickstand dented the floor of the bed!!!!

Hate:
TERRIBLE DEALER!! Pearl motor company in Mexico Missouri!!! 
Took my truck in at least 4 times for same problem. Truck was leaning to the drivers side! I know what your thinking, but I weigh only 190lbs. I was told by the Shop Manager that it was normal and should settle out soon. I brought it back two months later and he said it didn't have enough time to settle yet. With 3000 miles on it, I would think it did. Brought it back again, same story. &quot;I think it is normal, sir!&quot; Needless to say I took it to the next step and called GM Customer support and Voila!! It got fixed! But not by them, by another dealer in my area. They ended up replacing both front and both rear springs!
Throwout bearing in transmission failed on long trip. At 18,xxx miles I noticed the clutch grabbing alot. I thought it was me, so I ignored it until it grabbed when I was in traffic and came within inches of running into another car. I took it to my dealer once again and got the &quot;we can't find anything wrong with it&quot; I took it to the other dealer &quot;Feels like the clutch is sticking or grabbing!&quot; Warranty repair!
Paint is coming off of the grill. The paint seems to be fading around the radiator opening in the grill, it is the black/ grey color and it is fading very badly. Dealer says &quot;normal&quot;
Within one week of having it the service engine soon light came on. Not that big of a deal, except I had to leave it at the dealer ALL DAY to get this 10 minute job done. The mechanic said he had to reset the crank trigger with the engine analyzer. 10 minutes. Shop manager said it took all day and charger GM all that labor!
I guess what I am trying to say is that even with the best warranty in the world, the best truck is nothing without a good dealer. Do your homework and check out the dealer!!!! Don't get jerked around like I did. Thanks!
