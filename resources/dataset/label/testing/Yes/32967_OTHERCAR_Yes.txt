            I have owned my 1997 Camry LE for about 2 years now, having purchased it used with 27,000 miles on it. (I'm now over 80,000 miles, so I have a decent perspective on the merits of the vehicle) At $15,000, it seemed a lot of car for the money.  I bought it for the reliability and for the interior space.  I am 6'8&quot; and that tends to cut down on the range of cars I could ever purchase.  No Miatas for me.  For whatever reason, Hondas and Toyotas are an adequate fit.  The styling is sleek, but undistinguished.  

What's good about it?  It has a soft and solid ride. How much a person likes it may be a matter of personal taste.  At first my wife was uncomfortable with the handling in that she didn't get a &quot;feel&quot; of the road as she had with other cars we'd owned.  Indeed, it drives like a big car - steady, quiet and unspectacular.  Over time, she grew to like to ease of use and the feel of the brakes. My gas mileage is in the area of 27 mpg which is not bad at all for a full size sedan.

The upholstry is sufficiently plush.  There is lots of passenger room and the trunk is big enough for lots of luggage and groceries.  The instrument panel is sensibly arrayed.  The built in holder for a garage door opener is a nice touch. (it doubles as a sunglasses holder) I had not seen it on any vehicle before.  The bumpers have withstood some modest contact with no damage.  My driver's side and passenger's side air bags have (happily) seen no use.

I have had no major problems with the transmission.  I try to keep up with the maintenance schedule and not much more beyond that is required.  One criticism, though, about the owner's manual: the manual suggests that the timing belt is to be replaced at 60,000 or so if the car is used heavily (as with a taxi).  However, my dealer informed me that the timing belt must be done no matter how heavy the use.  I called Toyota to ask about this and the customer service guy I spoke with conceded that the owner's manual was misleading.  Had my timing belt failed on its own I would be furious and I daresay Toyota wouldn't have paid for the resulting damage.

One other problem: the paint on the front grill keeps chipping and flaking off.  I have never seen this in any car I have owned and it is annoying.  Now I know why people buy those bras for cars.

To be sure, there is much to commend the Camry and my complaints are fairly minor as things go.  This car will not stir the blood of those who hunger for speed, performance and excitement.  It is not sporty in any sense of the word (at least my 4-cylindar model isn't), but Camry owners wouldn't be looking for sportiness anyway.  For reliability, comfort and economy it delivers the goods and maybe that's not too shabby!<br><br>
