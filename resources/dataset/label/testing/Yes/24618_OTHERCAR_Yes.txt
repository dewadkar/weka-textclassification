            The new infiniti I30 is a car that truly can't be beat.It's 227 horse power engine.It gives you the ride of your life.The drive is smooth, and it's an easy controllable car at high speeds, due to the fact of its steering adjustments automatically done when the car is at high speeds.But with all goods the bad comes along with it.There are many blind spots in the car and it's hard to see over your shoulder because the headrests are in the way.
The I30 t model is highly recommended because of the features that comes along with it that you cannot find on the regular model,such as,traction control,and navigation system.The interior is nice and roomy.This car is a definite plus, that's why i got one and i didn't regret it.<br><br>
