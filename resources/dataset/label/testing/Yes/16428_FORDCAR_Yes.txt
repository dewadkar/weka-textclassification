                <b>America's</b> best selling full-sized sedan of the mid 1990's, the Crown Victoria offered new levels of refinement to the big sedan sector of motoring. While dated by todays standards, the 1997 Crown Vic held its own in the the mid 90s, not only as federal and state law enforcement units, but as civilized large sedans.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   The 1997 Crown Victoria weighs almost 3,900 lbs and only has 190 horse power to move it, you automatically think 'slow.' Not by any means is the Crown Victoria fast, but it does surprisingly well in the off-the-line <b>performance</b> category. Not only is this Ford strong off-the-line, but the 4.6 liter is smooth all the way to redline. With only 260 lb-ft of torque the 97 Crown Victoria also did well on hills, not needing to down-shift to accelerate up the steepest inclines. While not doing it fast, in time this heavy weight accelerated quite well up the hills. 
<b>Cruising</b> is very smooth, engine noise can not be heard, and bumps are taken extremely well, vibration is also isolated. The 1997 Crown Vic also handles very well for a car of its mass. The <b>suspension</b> is softly sprung, so the Crown Victoria has a tendency to pitch and wallow but holds the road surprisingly well. Despite the large radials, body lean can be alarming around corners and the steering feels somewhat vague, but don't get me wrong, while not nimble this car did handle well for a car in its category. 
<b>Braking</b> was 'so-so', my test car (owned by a family member) was quite bad, I'm not sure if this is because the brakes had not been changed or what, but at 54,000 miles this car needed a heavy foot to stop this behemoth. Brakes are front discs with Drums in the rear; ABS in an option. <b>NOTE:</b> This car only comes with a 4-speed automatic transmission.  

  The Crown Victoria's <b>chassis</b> hardware dates back to 1979. The 1997 Crown Vic rides on a  114" wheelbase, chassis features an all-coil-sprung <b>suspension</b>, independent at the front, but a live rear axle in the rear. Front and rear anti roll bars are used, although the Chassis and springs are tuned for a soft ride, rather than sporty. 

  <b>About the engine:</b> All Crown Victoria's for 1997 are powered by Ford's 4.6 modular SOHC engine. This 4.6 is made of cast iron construction, and like most modern engines it has electronic fuel injection which feeds fuel to each of the cylinders. The 4.6 in the 1997 Crown Vic is rated at 190 horse power, and 260lb-ft of torque.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b>, while not too dated back in 1997, is now considered a dinosaur set-up. Everything was so simple in this car and plain. The dash is more '1980s' than 1990's and there is a thin, semi tacky wood strip that lines the middle of the dash like an equator. The steering wheel was not as thick as I would have liked it to have been, however it was not too bad. Test car came with AC, power everything, a tachometer, and a premium sound system (no CD player). Ergonomics are good, everything is well placed, but there really weren't too many amenities in this car, so this is relatively speaking. The Crown Vic makes very good use of the space provided, offering more legroom in the rear. The seats are comfortable and supportive, and the drivers position is excellent.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>  

   The <b>exterior</b> while 'loads' better looking than its predecessor, is a little dated. Even for 1997 this car is lacking what it takes for it to be a Cosmo model. Even  after 1991, the Crown Victoria's boxy appearance was replaced by slick aerodynamic lines, but it retained a conservative look which suits many buyers, just not me. 

 <b>Price & Reliability:</b> In 1997 the price for the Crown Victoria was around $24,000, Today with bad resale, and a new,(1998 ) much more desired model, the 1997 Crown Vic can be had for less than half for what it ran for when it was new. Reliability at 54,000 miles was quite disappointing after listening to a story I had heard, the owner of this car had spent almost 2,000 dollars in repairs after the warranty wore out. He even said that the car now used oil. I'm not sure if this is a common problem with the Crown Victoria's, so please check around before buying one.


<i>Final Thoughts:</i>


The Crown Victoria represents an excellent value in the used car market. The ride is relatively plush, and serves every purpose it is meant to serve with honors. Despite the fact that some more power on tap would be useful, this car is recommended 100% to anyone looking for a used full sized family cruiser.
