            We did not purchase this vehicle, however, while we went on vacation out west, we rented one.  We decided to rent an SUV because of all the off road places to go in the areas that we visit, including Death Valley, Red Rock Canyon, and a few other places out in the western states.

I loved the handling of the vehicle.  It truly surprised me that it was not like driving a truck, nor like driving a car.  About the only way to describe it is it's a mix of both.  Parking it was extremely easy also, I thought I'd have a hard time but with the sharp turning capability, it was a piece of cake.  On and off road, it rides very beautifully.  The sharp turns when off road are handled well, and the bumps are taken very comfortably, almost like riding in a car.  

The room in the vehicle is very nice.  The back cargo area is large enough for a lot of luggage, the back seat is comfortable for two people at least, we didn't have any more in it.  The front seats are comfortable enough, and adjustable enough that you can sleep.  I also enjoyed the feature that I could set the seat to where I wanted it, and my husband could set it to where he wanted his, and alls we had to do when driving after the other is push a button.

All and all I enjoyed this vehicle and found no cons about it.  Although I'm going to find it hard to give up my Intrepid, this will be a consideration when we are in the market for a new vehicle.<br><br>
