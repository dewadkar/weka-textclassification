            I recently bought a 1999 New Jetta GS. It is such a nice vehicle. The trunk is amazingly bigger than it looks. PLUS, the back seats fold down for extra space. But of course, I have noticed some of the negative things over the past few months. First, to recline the seats you need to turn a dial like know. This is annoying. You would think that it would be easier but it is hard to get your hand in there and turn the knob. Secondly, the cloth seats attract EVERYTHING!!!! I have trouble vacuuming up the pet hair and the sweater or fabric fuzz from my clothing. In addition, I got the forest green color. This color shows dirt worse than black. 

Although, on the PLUS side. The car runs smooth. Has a very cool illuminating interior and is very roomy. I rate this car a 7 on a 1-10 scale. <br><br>
