            I love my CR-V. It's one of the best vehicles I've ever owned. To give you an idea of what the CR-V has to offer, I've made up a list of Pros and Cons that should give you an idea of what to expect from the 1998 CR-V.

PROS:
When you look at a CR-V you think compact SUV. However, once inside, you'll feel like you're in a midsized SUV. It's just that roomy. I'm 6'3" so I should be an expert on roominess.

Creature comforts are abundant. You get power windows,locks,and mirrors, cruise control, air conditioning with micro-filtration sytem,reclining front and rear seatbacks, storage bins galore, a 4 speaker audio system.. to name a few. One really cool feature is the folding picnic table in the cargo area. We've used it quite a few times and its very sturdy.

My CR-V is the EX model with ABS, automatic transmission, alloy wheels, and Real-Time 4 Wheel Drive. Since it was an early '98 model, I have an  AM-FM stereo w/cassette like the '97 model. However, I also have the 6 disc CD changer, instead of the standard AM-FM CD head unit found on most EX models. Other features I have are tinted windows and a power moonroof. It was a special-order model because there was a waiting list on CR-Vs from 1997 thru early 1998.

CONS:
When it comes to pulling all this weight around, the CR-V is no powerhouse. The motor is a 2.0 liter 4 cylinder derived from the Acura Integra. It only puts out 126 horsepower. That's not a lot of power to start with, and to make matters worse, it's powerband is at the higher RPMs like a sportscar. Not the best combination for a four wheel drive truck. It has to downshift on long grades, but when you're in the higher rpms, the CR-V does have enough power. It's just that if you're driving one, you don't want to have to run it hard all the time to get the power. The 99-2001 models have 20 more horsepower. I drove one and I can't tell the difference.

Another complaint I have is that the power window switches are on the dash. It's not so much the placement as it is that they're hard to use at night. Illuminated switches or switches on the door would help.

Also, while the CR-V looks better with the factory roof rack, it's not worth the extra money. I purchased mine without it because the maximum capacity is only 80 lbs. I took the money and bought a THULE roof rack system that can carry twice the weight for the same price. Now I can carry a cargo shuttle and two bikes instead of the factory racks limit of two bikes only.

My last complaint is the lack of a passenger-side armrest. The driver's seat and the backseats all have armrest. Why not the front passenger's seat? The armrest isn't offered from Honda. There's an aftermarket outfitter that makes and sells it (see www.jjproducts.com). If you find a '97-'98 CR-V with a front passenger armrest, you're lucky.

As you can see, my cons are minimal, but there are some. The CR-V isn't perfect, but it's the closest you'll get to it if you're looking for a top-notch SUV that gets good gas mileage. It's a Honda- meaning it's well-built and will probably outlive most of us. I love mine, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a sensible practical vehicle. It wasn't the #1 selling SUV in it's class for nothing.
