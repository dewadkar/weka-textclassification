            If you are going to buy a Caravan- get the grand- you will appreciate having the extra room.  I have now owned 3 Plymouth/Dodge Minivans.  I would still own my 1992 with over 115,000 miles but it was in an accident. It's only problem was that the 1992 transmissions were not good and have had over 63 changes.  Had to replace ours at 85,000 miles.

There is a reason you see so many of the Caravan/Voyagers on the road- they drive like cars and feel comfortable to drive. You are above most cars and can see the road more clearly. Only problem is you do have blind spots when a car is beside you.  you must look down.

I bought a used 1999 van which did help in the savings.  Our van has a cd player, automatic roll down driver window (which is really nice), the 5 doors, and keyless entry.  The keyless entry is nice because you don't have to wait for someone to open a door and then unlock the other doors.  All the doors can be opened with 2 clicks of the button.  Our back bench seat can lay down into a bed.

Improvements over my 1992 are the location of the radio, back seat air controls.  This time we have captain's chairs which seem to be a hit. What I had to pay extra for in my LE now seems to be standard- electric locks and the rear air.  What is also interesting is the cost of my 1992 LE is the same as a 2000 SE with almost the same features.  Costs have come down.  I like having a larger windshield and I am still trying to decide if there is that big a difference between &quot;European&quot; wipers and standard ones.

What I miss though is the nice glove compartment lost to the second air bag, my push button lights (I don't like turning a dial to get my lights on), my electric seats (I have an SE now) and my rear pop-up gate door.  I guess the back gate doesn't open with a click anymore because of the problem of them opening when on the road.  The ability to see the front is lost because of the slope of the car.  The bumper is lower and we tend to hit it when we park.

All in all, if you want to be able to haul around your guests and neighbors and their kids in one vehicle, a van is great.  It keeps my 2 kids in different areas of the van so they don't fight and argue with each other. It's great for travel, one of us adult drivers can sleep in the reclining back seat- I gave it a try and it was comfortable.  I couldn't make it go back all the way because of our luggage, but it was nice.<br><br>
