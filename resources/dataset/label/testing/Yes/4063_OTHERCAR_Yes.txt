            In August of 1998 we purchased a Brand New Chevrolet Venture Mini-Van (Extended LS)well equipped with remote power sliding door and rear heat and a/c. This vehicle is extremely handy for all our needs (we have two kids 10 &amp; 13). My wife uses the vehicle most of the time and she says it�s the best she has ever driven. Personally I have driven Windstars and Caravans and the Venture has the best ride. The biggest surprise was its highway gas mileage. June of last year we drove from Michigan to Florida fully loaded with luggage and it averaged 26-27 miles per gallon of gas. The vans 3400 V6 engine seems to handle the size and weight extremely well. The remote sliding door is very handy and I highly recommend this option. Our model has the 2nd row captain�s chairs. Both the third and second row seats are very easy to remove and not heavy to carry. If you are looking for Family vehicle that is very functional the GM family of mini-vans are definitely a good choice. By the way we have about 17,000 miles on this vehicle and currently no major problems have occurred.<br><br>
