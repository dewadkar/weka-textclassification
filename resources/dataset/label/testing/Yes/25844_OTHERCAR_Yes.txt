              I recently purchased this car.  I wasn't very sure whether or not I wanted a Jeep.  I had heard that they guzzled gas and that it was easier to tip them over if you went to fast.  Then I test drove this car and my opinion totally changed.  As soon as I sat down in the car, I felt a sense of power.  It was incredible.  The feeling of being higher than all the other cars out there.

  That's not the only reason that I liked the car so much.  After seeing how it could handle curves with ease, and how its acceleration was great, I had to have it.  I even got a great purchase price on it: 24,999.  This thing is fully loaded too.  Cd player, power windows, power locks, sunroof, mud flaps, window shields...you name it, its got it.

  After buying the car, I also learned one other great thing about it.  It is great for off-roading.  Before purchasing this SUV, I had never really thought that a car was supposed to go off-roads.  Now, I find it second nature.  I drive the car through swamps, through mud thats 2 feet deep, and best of all through streams that come almost over the hood.  I'm still learning all there is to know about the SUV, but so far, its definitely a winner.

  One other really cool feature is the tent that attaches to the back.  It is awesome.  I have already used it to go camping in, and it really makes for a fun vacation car.  It even seats up to five, so it can be good for a family or just a guy who wants to have some fun.  If you're looking for a car in the 25,000 dollar price range, and don't mind buying a little extra gas now and then, this is the car for you.
