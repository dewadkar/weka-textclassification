            This is a great car for people who want the safety and security of all wheel drive, but don't want to drive a truck. With the back seats folded down there is plenty of cargo room for all but the biggest loads. The back seats are comfortable for adults and there is plenty of head room all around. The handling is tight and the ride is firm but not uncomfortable. The engine has plenty of power but gets good gas mileage. I get 27-28 mpg on the highway and 25 around town. The all wheel drive works great. In five Vermont winters I have never been stuck, even with an unplowed driveway. 
The only drawback to the car is that it is a little noisy on the highway. I would recommend this car to anyone thinking of a sport utility vehicle. The Legacy wagon has plenty of space and is comfortable to drive. It handles like a good car should, but with the all wheel drive you never get stuck and don't have to worry about locking and unlocking hubs. It does not guzzle gas and is very easy to drive around town.<br><br>
