            My wife and I have been car shopping for a little over a year. It's not that we're procrastinators by any means... we are choosy! Her Tercel was just too small and light for the type of commuting and travel we do so we were looking a step up. Something in a sedan sized--4 doors. On a spur of the moment we decided to go look at the 2000 Sunfires. I'd read a little about them and found reviews indicating they are reliable.

We test drove the 2000 Sunfire sedan. I rode in the back seat during the test drive, not to be a backseat driver but to check out the ride from the normally least comfortable spot. The ride was smooth; I wasn't jarred and bounced and had plenty of leg room (but then again, I'm only 5'7&quot;).

We looked around a little more and decided on a 2000 Sunfire SE Sedan. SE is Special Edition...it is fully loaded with auto windows, locks, mirrors, and a wild little feature on the stereo that adjusts the volume based on the speed of the vehicle. There are also childseat tethers in the back and the glove compartment and trunk are massive for the size of the car. It even has a rear spoiler.

We'd found an internet broker who could get us the car for under $16,000. We took that paperwork into our local dealer to see if they could meet or beat the price. They did.

Since we bought the car we have enjoyed taking it on both short and long trips. The ride is comfortable and quiet. The handling is smooth and the car is responsive. Pickup on the highway is smooth as is the automatic shifting. The seats, though perhaps not best for very tall people, adjust to provide plenty of leg room in the front.

The gas tank holds over 14 gallons so the car has a long range. We've gotten plenty of compliments on the car. It's looks are sporty and in white it is very hip.

If you're budget conscious but want something sporty and loaded, the 2000 Sunfire SE is the car for you. We would have paid nearly the same on a base model Grand Am or Grand Prix, but we didn't need anything quite that big. As it was, we were able to buy a fully-loaded car and spend less than the $16,000 I mentioned previously. It was a great deal and I look forward to driving my hip Sunfire around for quite some time.<br><br>
