            After a lonnnggg time of looking for a digital camera, I found the perfect one for my wife and I.  My ideal camera was 1+ megapixel, optical zoom, and USB connection, all for an affordable price.  The camera is extremely easy to use, actually easier than my wife's 35mm.  While the batteries don't last that long, it's not a big deal to me.  They have never run out at a bad time, plus I bought rechargeable AA batteries.  Three sets and the charger cost about $35 and now I don't worry about it at all.  The included 4 meg card is ridiculously small, and the first thing I did is purchased a 64 meg card.  At brick &amp; mortar stores, these can go for $200.  With a $20 off coupon from buy.com, I got one for ~$80.  I won't be needing another one.  The USB connection is great- transfers are instant.  The picture quality seems great, although it must be noted that I have yet to print any of the photos.  

Another good feature is the sliding lens cover, which protects the lens when not in use.  This camera is fairly small and has fit in my pocket.

The one thing which may be a drawback to some is the lack of a video out to view the pictures on a television.  While it would have been nice, the other features it DOES have more than make up for it.

Add to that a $50 mail in rebate, and you can't go wrong, in my opinion.<br><br>
