            I currently drive a used Plymouth Neon 2000. When I first bought it, there was approximately 20,000 miles on it. From the time I was a little tyke to that point I had always wanted a Neon. The amount of space in the backseat is unbelievable compared to my former '93 Dodge Daytona. Due to credit problems and the like, I couldn't manage to get an 'upgraded' Neon so I have just the basics, plus an automatic transmission verses a manual. 
<b>The nicer side of life</b>
The car itself is cute. I've seen young to old driving around in 'em so the look apparently appeals to every age group. The interior is comfortable and everything is in just the right spot. You don't have to go out of your way to reach anything and risk getting into an accident. As I said, mine just has the basics - AM/FM radio, cassette player, standard wheels, manual windows and locks, etc. etc. The only downside to the car is the amount you have to pay in order to snazz it up a bit. A CD player for the car can cost anywhere from 500-700 dollars where I generic CD player you might find at Wal-Mart and fits multiple makes and models of cars generally won't cost you more than 200. 
<b>Lurking in the shadows</b>
I've only been driving the car for a few months. I purchased it in May. Whether it's me looking for a reason to get an even newer car or whether it's really happening can be debatable, but it feels as if the engine is hesitant when taking off. I'm not the most passive driver either however, so it could be me being a bit too harsh on the car. Shame on me, yes, but along with that I'm about 500 miles over due for an oil change. As with every newly driven vehicle, there's always going to be some adjustments the driver has to make. The Neon's back end is a bit higher than what I was used to but now it doesn't even phase me. The car is also higher off the ground than what I'm used to - once again, doesn't phase me.
The bonus: with the prices in gas these days always fluctuating, it can get amazingly high. The manual has said so itself - the Neon works best with REGULAR gas! It's not even recommended that you 'feed' it premium. It's really good on gas and I'm getting more mpg with the Neon than I've gotten with any other previous cars driven.
