            S40s aren't built in Gï¿½teburg but in Holland's old DAF factory as a joint venture of Mitsubishi and Volvo. Ford, now the owner of Volvo, sponsored the last facelift and the improvement of the front axle, then withdrew from that venture. DaimlerChrysler now (part-) owner of Mitsubishi will soon need the capacity of the plant to built the new Mitsubishi hatchbacks and maybe even the 4-door Smart. S40s will only be built there for another 2 years and it's replacement (S50 / V50) will be built on the Ford Focus platform at another site.

So is this car a DAF, a Mitsubishi, a Ford, a Daimler or Chrysler or a still a Volvo?

I bought a 2001 S40 two months ago and I like it a lot. The new adaptive 5 speed transmission shifts ultra smooth - almost like the continuous variable torque gearless transmission from old DAFs. The standard window airbag side impact protection is similar to other Volvos. The dependibility is Mitsubishi-like (excellent). The design isn't anything like the boxy Volvos from the past. And the price at 24k is not far above Ford standard.

Sound confusing? Take the S40 for a very non-confusing testdrive.
