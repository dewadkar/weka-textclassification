            I had to ask myself, "What in the heck is this? How could this take digital pictures, be able to connect to my computer, be able to send e-mail pictures, and only cost $39.95"!? Well, it was advertised as $59.95, with an instant $20 coupon taken off at the counter! Now, for that price, even this careful shopper was willing to take the chance that Polaroid could manage to do this! Sometimes, what you pay for is NOT what you get! I love this little camera that is digital, small, easily carried around in my purse, and just plugs right into my computer with no problem!

Think how much most digital cameras cost. Now, do you really need all those bells and whistles on there? I don't. I just take my available 15 pictures on this easily used tiny camera, plug it into my computer with the cord that comes with it, download the pictures, send the e-mails, save the pictures in the computer album, and print out the pictures! Then, I erase the ones on there, and start all over again! How easy is that? It comes with a CD that installs the program, and you are able to do all sorts of changing of the pictures. You can add frames. You can make the picture kind of warpy looking, you can make fun pictures that are great to send and to keep. 

The colors are crisp and bright! They are not blurry or fuzzy, at all. O.K., my 6 year old grandson DID do one picture that was a bit on tilt, but, then, he IS only 6 yrs. old! The directions can be easily followed, as there barely ARE any! It is truly that simply used. 

If you do not have a digital camera, due to the high cost of all I've seen, give this one a try! I thought I'd never be able to get one, because of the cost factor, yet, am absolutely thrilled with this Polaroid Fun camera. . .the Polaroid Corporation PhotoMax620 for all of us who just want to be able to take pictures on a whim and be able to e-mail them, store them, and print them out! Give it a try! Let me know if you do. I really am impressed with this easily used bit of fun for all!
