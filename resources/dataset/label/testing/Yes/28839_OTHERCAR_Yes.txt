            I have been enjoying my 210 Plus for better than a year now and I must say that I am pleased.  Consider the following:

Pros:
1.  No film to develop
2.  Relatively quick availability
3.  Instant review of picture taken
4.  Delete photos not needed
5.  Good weight, feels good
6.  Multiple uploading options (cable, memory card reader, infrared)
7.  Custom photo framing options (via BMP upload to memory card)
8.  Autofocus
9.  Autoflash

Cons:
1.  LCD display absolutely eats AA batteries (about 4 per 50 photos).  Two sets of rechargeable batteries are highly recommended.
2.  Limited zoom capability
3.  Cannot see LCD well or at all on an average sunny day.
4.  Requires expensive paper and/or special printer to get quality prints that still won't rival standard photos
5.  For taking many pictures at a time (30+) you will need multiple memory cards, which can be expensive as well as difficult to keep up with.  If you have a computer and a card reader or cable, you can download, then continue snapping photos.
6.  Offloading photos via cable is very slow and kills batteries unless you have the power adapter which in turns requiring being near a power outlet.

In summary, there are times when a 35mm is just the way to go, but this camera is very convenient, and a powerful work tool.  I use it to take photos to include in reports, etc. and it is irreplaceable for that.<br><br>
