            I just got this camera today(Nov. and I saw it in August).
This is the best $220 I ever spent on a camera.(Only the camera/no box or batteries or memory stick)  but I have a 256 & 512 meg stick & Firewire already.

I had come across this from my boss, who had my buy it at the time for $270 with tax when it first came out.  He took it to Greece, and the underwater shots were crystal clear.  

My social life is very active, with freetime predominately surf, paintball, snowboarding, and clubbing in Hollywood every weekend night.  Which means I don't have alot of money saved up for high-budge cameras because I use it all on fun.  I don't ever have to sit there and ready the cam.  Just point and click with one shot, 1 hand, while I am moving.

This camera was really affordable and for the stuff I do, I would say it's perfect.  Quick snapshots, action shots while I surf, outside pics are very good quality on a sunny day.  The pics are nothing bad that a little Photoshop can't help touch up.

It also takes cool 15 second movies big enough to send over the internet.  I took a 15 sec. footage of surf, and it was only 344kb.  I easily sent over 56.6k modem to friends.

I've even dropped it a couple of times on pavement and bounced a little.  The worst that happened was somee scratches which had no effect on the functionality of the camera.

3 things that suck. 1)NO zoom 2)Only 6 foot flash distance)
3)Battery Hog.
BUT.... if you have a separate flash that has auto-sync to it, you can use this camera with an extra flash.
So it's not as good as a 3.0 megapixel, but hey... $200 isn't bad for the quality this thing takes.  

Alkaline batteries have no chance on this.  I bought brand new Energizer AAAalkaline batteries and they died after 5 minutes.  Alkaline is absolutely horrible for this camera.  This camera needs Nickel Hydride rechargable batteries since they don't make lithium AAA batteries.

I put in Nickel batteries though and go the camera working 3 hours+.

Mine didn't come with a manual, but I was able to figure the camera out in 5 minutes.  The menu is easy to navigate, and was about x2 easier to learn than my Cell Phone.  A dummy can operate the settings on this.
