            Isuzu has done excellent job with the Axiom to enter the Crossover Vehicle Class.

The first time I drove this vehicle, I absolutely fell in love with it.  It does 0-60 in 8 sec flat (fastest in it's class).  It out runs and out performs any and all SUV's in its class.  The best thing I liked was when a BMW X5 (3.0) came along and I absolutely creamed him.  It was a joy to see his jaw drop when I saw him in the rear view mirror.  The main reason for this is the 3.5-v6 engine that generates 230 bhp.

A word of caution, this vehicle is not for the weak hearted and the slow.  You can zip through corners and runs down the straights with confidence.  I've had it since March and have not had a single problem.

The interior is awesome.  With the leather covered steering wheel, chrome and metal shift lever and brake handle, large LCD computer display, and very well planned dash it makes it classier than any SUV out there.  You feel like you're in the cockpit of an airplane.

The only thing I would like changed though would be the Goodyear tires.  They wear out too quickly and have crappy wet traction.  But since I upgraded to Michelin, it has made a huge difference in wet traction and overall performance.

All in all, the Axiom is rugged, tough, very fast and yet practical and sophisticated.
