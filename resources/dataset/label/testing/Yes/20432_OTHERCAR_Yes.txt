            I am the happy owner of a Dark Blue 2000 Jetta GLS. Everyday that I drive, I am assured to have a fun time. You really can't beat what you get in this car for the price you pay. Overall, it handles like a dream; you will find yourself zipping around corners like never before just because you like the feel of it. The Jetta offers a smooth and powerful ride (I have the manual shift, I've heard the automatics tend to sap the power) which makes it fun to zoom on by just about any other car on the road. I chose the GLS package which is perfect for my style. Everything is automatic including my sunroof; however there are other ways to use all the options if something should go wrong (like a manual crank hidden for the sunroof). You can crack the back end of the sunroof upwards or you can open it horizontally from the front- as much or as little as you want. Plus, it's nice to have even on rainy or cool days because light still pours in from above. The automatic windows are loaded with features so make sure your dealer informs you on all of them. For instance, one touch of the window button makes it go all the way down or all the way up(you don't have to hold the button down). Or, you can stop it part way by hitting the button again. For someone who has always had to crank a window down or hold a button, this has been a nice added extra at toll booths here in New England! All the controls are easily accessible and very user friendly. For a car that has so many added features, it's amazing how easy it is to use and figure them all out. And that's the key- they are all usable. You will not find any silly features that jack up the price that you never have use for. 

Additionally, I chose black leather interior. I have to say, this is one my favorite parts. By paying a little extra, I believe this will help the interior last longer than if I had chosen cloth. The sound system is incredible, the seats have lumbar support controls, and the steering wheel as well as the seat is fully adjustable. Not only is the ride fun, it's comfortable on long and short trips. 

My only complaint is about the cup holders in the front (they have them in the back as well). They only fit the size of a soda can or smaller. So, if you stop and get one of those plastic bottles of soda or a glass bottle of juice... it won't fit. So, that is just poor design on the part of Volkswagon. But everything else is well thought out. You can rest assured that not only is this a good buy for all that you will get out of a Jetta, but also because it is a safe car for its class type- and you can't beat the reputation or value that Volkswagon is known for. But don't just take my word for it... go drive one- even if it's just for fun. You will be amazed and pleasantly surprised at the amount of enjoyment this car has to offer; especially for the price.<br><br>
