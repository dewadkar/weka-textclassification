            My first Cadillac was a 1975 Sedan Deville 4-door hardtop. It had a dark
blue top, was finished in Georgian Silver Metallic, and featured dark blue
leather upholstery. A little plaque on the step plate announced &quot;Body by
Fisher - Interior by Fleetwood.&quot;

This car was simply magnificent. Its enormous dimensions and sleek styling
made it seem like a parade of one. Everything about this car was big.  
Here are some of the specs:

Overall Length: 230&quot; (Over 19 feet!)   Wheelbase: 130&quot;    Width: 80&quot;    Height:  54&quot; Weight: 4,059 lbs. Fuel Tank Capacity: 28.5 gallons.

But most of all it had the enormous 500 cubic-inch (8.2 litre) 4bbl V-8! Unfortunately, the prehistoric '70s emissions controls emasculated this huge powerplant rendering a measly 215 hp. Acceleration was pretty good. Gas mileage wasn't as bad as one may think. It got about 15 MPG on the highway which is probably better than many of these oversized SUVs of today. City mileage, however, was abominable: probably about 8 MPG.

1975 was a year of firsts for Cadillac. It was the first Caddy to feature quad rectangular headlamps and also the first year airbags were offered in any car. The 1975 Cadillac brochure shows these early airbags. 

Anyway, this car definitely had presence! I was constantly looking at my reflection in store windows and buildings as I drove this car much like the gentleman in a recent ad on television - I believe for Acura. The hood of the car was so long you could probably park a Geo Metro on it. The trunk was so huge, I was able to put a La-Z-Boy recliner in it.

Picture skirted wheels, the prominent crest and &quot;V&quot; on the front and back of the car, the rich leather interior, the huge cross-hatch grille, wide-whitewall tires and most of all the awesome length and width of this car - a long low silhouette. Cadillac needs to put a little more of this 
kind of essence in its current crop of cars - at a more reasonable size of course. I can't picture any automaker making a car of this dimensions these days.

The nicest thing was its four-door hardtop body style. The car almost had a sporty appearance with all windows down and no B-pillar to interrupt the open space. Today's carmakers should seriously consider bringing back the beautiful hardtop as it did the convertible.

Of course there were things about the '75 Cadillac I'm glad Cadillac doesn't do anymore. In place of real wood was heavy industrial strength plastic with a Mediterranean-revival theme. Body panel tolerances were laughable. I'd like to see Lexus' famous &quot;ball bearing&quot; commercial done using a '75 Caddy. Handling was extremely sloppy.

If one were to consider buying a '75 Cadillac today, I'd check the car for rust since the 1971-76 Cadillac body shell is particularly susceptible to rust. The area below the back window and along the quarter panel trim are common sites for rust. The quad rectagular headlamps, new 
for that year, tend to pop out of alignment as the car ages. Power antennas commonly fail. A new system can be had aftermarket for about $180, but are a pain to install. Mechanically the cars are pretty tough, but pay particular attention to the brakes. I've learned an expensive
lesson about that! I ended up replacing just about the entire brake system due to my negligence.

To summarize, the 1975 Cadillac is a car to be experienced. It is an awesome reminder of what luxury motoring was all about in the not-so-distant past.
