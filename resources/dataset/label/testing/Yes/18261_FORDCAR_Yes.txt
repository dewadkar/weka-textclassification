            My husband & I bought our Escort Wagon used for $2500 and it's been worth every penny. It gets great gas mileage, runs like a dream, is large enough for company or hauling, yet small enough to feel sporty.  I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.

We bought it from its first owner, an elderly woman who barely drove it, so it was almost like new inside and out.  Mine is an automatic -- wish it were standard, so I could really get the feel for this car.  I like the rear wiper, the map pockets & roomy glovebox.  The front seats are so comfortable I don't think about them, and they adjust easily for all heights.  Rear seats fold down with one click, either at 1/3, 2/3 or all the way: I appreciate that I can fold down part & still take a passenger in the back seat.

Hatchback rear is roomy enough to haul all the emergency gear you'd ever need for long travels, and with seats folded down a car full of luggage to the airport is easy.

My chief complaint is the visors: they are built on a cardboard base: the driver's side broke easily, and the repair is outrageously expensive.  The passenger's visor hits the rear-view mirror when dropped down, throwing off my rear-view.  Again, not an inexpensive fix, so I have two ineffective visors (dangerous).  Both visors have lighted mirrors, so when the driver's side visor broke it shorted the light, too.

Other charming features: cup holder has plenty of space for two drinks and a pair of sunglasses, center between seats room for toll change.  Dash cannot hold anything for any turn around a corner: should be deeper, or lined with a skid-resistant material.  Side mirrors adjust easily from driver's side.  Stereo is simple to manipulate while on the road, as are air controls.

There is plenty of room under front seats for atlas, flashlight & umbrella to tuck away without rolling.

Sweetheart of a car!
