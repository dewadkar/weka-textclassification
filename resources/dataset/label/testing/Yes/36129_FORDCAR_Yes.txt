            See my earlier (January '00) epinion for my initial thoughts on this promising car.

We selected the Focus over the Forester, the Volvo V70/V40, and the Legacy, due to side-impact airbags and non-leather interior being available on the Focus wagon.  Price was a consideration, but not so much as those two options combined.  We've had our Focus SE wagon for a year now, and overall it's been a decent car.  We've put over 13,000 miles on it, both highway and around-town.  No long road-trips, so I can't speak to how it might perform for those.  The mileage, handling, design and interior of the car are great for this price range, BUT, that said, we often regret purchasing this car--whenever we have to go to the dealer.  

In and out of the shop for recall after recall (nine and counting--got another two postcards this week.)  These have included just about every area of this car--the transmission, the seats, the cruise control, the A-pillars, the brakes, and on and on.  There is a persistent rattle in the cargo area that no one seems able to resolve.  The roof rack's adjustable arm often comes loose and must be tightened regularly.  Over the summer (May-October), the car's rear-passenger window was inoperable due to a part shortage and dealer apathy.  The electronic locks malfunction when the weather turns cold--this has locked us out of the car twice.  And the brakes squeak every single time you hit the brake pedal. 

On the bright side, the car gets excellent mileage, has tons of room for hauling things, and handles well.  We appreciate the height of the car--most others seem very low to the ground for entry/exit now.  It's relatively easy to see things around you, and the Ztec has enough pep for most driving needs.  It's easy to park.

My recommendation?  Probably would recommend the car, but with this qualification:  Be careful if you are looking at a Focus.  Check for a dealer with free loaners, and known good service.  We know others who have bought this car and it's been very reliable for them (all non-wagon buyers.)  So, maybe it's the wagon. Such promise--and a disappointment in so many ways.<br><br>
