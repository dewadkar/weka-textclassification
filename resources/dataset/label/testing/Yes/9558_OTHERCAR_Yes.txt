            I absolutely love my new 2000 Celica GT.  It is amazing to drive, and is a great value.  

ENGINE:
At first look the Celica seems like a weak, tiny, under-powered coupe,  which it is not.  The Celica's 1.8 liter, 140 hp engine seems to be weak, especially in comparison to the GT-S's 180 hp engine (which is actually the same engine, but with more horsepower--kind of like the V-TEC system) but if you drive the GT you'll quickly realize that this car is NOT slow.  The car has great acceleration, especially with a manual transmission.  

HANDLING:
You will be surprised when you feel how well this car handles.  This kind of handling is not normal for a Japanese front-wheel drive car.  Take this baby around a few turns and you'll soon want to test this car's limits.  It is absolutely amazing.  

BRAKING: 
I did not buy my car with ABS.  I had no choice (see below*).  However the car does brake very well without ABS and Car &amp; Driver seems to love the ABS brakes saying that the braking is &quot;well into exotic car territory.&quot;  I think that should be said about the entire car.  

VALUE:
My parents bought me a Celica over my other choice (2000 Maxima) mainly over the issue of price, oh but what a great deal this car is!  The Celica starts at an MSRP less than 18 grand.  This is a great deal.  The base Celica GT, with no options has all you need: AM/FM, CD, Air, power locks + windows, daytime running lights, power mirrors, and a 5-speed manual transmission!!!  Don't get an automatic, because this car was meant to be driven with a manual transmission.    The only other option I would recommend is the 15 in. aluminum alloy wheels, which are very nice, and maybe the spoiler if you so chose.  Most GT's, including mine, ship with those two options plus a power moon roof, which I find is not necessary.  

INTERIOR:
Don't let the Toyota name fool you, when you get behind the wheel of this car, you know the car is meant to fly.  The interior is designed like a cockpit, with orange analog dials that look really cool.  The dashboard has a brushed silver look which is very sleek looking as well.   I do not however, like the air vents, which are similar to those found in the Cougar, and are hard to get pointed in the right direction, but once they're there I have no problem with them.


While many people think of the Celica as a cramped car, it is only cramped in the back seat.  The front seats are roomy and VERY COMFORTABLE.  That is the first thing you will notice when sitting down inside the car.  The GT's seats have a cool mesh covering that looks great, and the ergonomic design makes them great for long trips.  The back seat is a different story however.  Unfortunately Toyota decided to be a little cheap, and didn't put the cool mesh covering over the back seats, so they look a little cheap.  They are also very cramped.  I can't sit back there too long because I hit my head against the back window, and I'm a 5'9'' male.  Although if you're a few inches shorter I've found that many of my friends can sit back there for hours with no problem.  The back seat is designed for 2 people, and trying to squeeze a third person in-between will only cause trouble (because the center is not padded and will really hurt your behind!) 

COMPETITORS:
Even though it is front-wheel drive the Celica drives as close to exotic as you can get from a Japanese car.  I know this because I am a valet parker, and have had first hand experience with many other cars.  The Celica is clearly a better choice than its competitors, the Eclipse, Cougar, and Integra.  While the Eclipse and Cougar have V-6 engines, they do not drive and handle like the Celica.  The Celica feels like a true sports car, while the others feel just like coupes.  The Integra, which drives much more like the Celica is in a different price range altogether, for no reason other than the Acura name.   

While you may be tempted to go off and buy a Civic with a 5-speed, be warned, the Civic is in no way a true sports car.  The Civic sedan drives no differently than the Civic coupe, and the gear shifter is a long pole, the kind found in econo-box cars where the only reason to get a 5-speed is to save money.  The gear shifter in the Celica is a small sporty gear shifter with nice small throws, which makes shifting loads of fun.  


RIDE:
The ride is a little stiff, which will seem a bit strange at first, especially to passengers.  The driver will soon realize that the stiff suspension goes perfect with the car, and you will not only begin to tolerate the ride, but also appreciate it.  The engine is also a bit noisy, but again this is a sports car, so it is actually a good thing.  My only problem with the engine noise is that you can't hear the radio that well at low volumes, but what the hell, crank it up!  You want to be noticed in this car.

STORAGE:
First off: hatchbacks are cool!  They also allow for extra storage space.  The trunk is not as small as it seems, but if it's too small for you, there's the standard 50/50 fold down rear seat, and the lid on the back of the trunk that pops off giving you plenty more room to pile up cargo on top.  


LOOKS:
Many people would buy this car on looks alone.  This is the first time in a long time that Toyota has made this car look good.  The last couple of body styles were very curvy and bubbly, which in my opinion did not look good at all.  For 2000 Toyota went all out, and added some sharp edges, wicked headlights, and an aggressive stance that makes the car look great.  Not since the 80's (when my father owned a Celica) did the car look this good.  

TOYOTA RELIABILITY:
What can I say?  This car is a Toyota, I don't expect to have any problems with it, and I haven't had any problems yet (see below*).  My dad had an old Celica for 10 years and put 110,000 miles on it.  When he sold it he got top dollar for it, and saw it around on the streets for another six years.  So I expect to have this car for a long time.


GAS MILEAGE:
My car�s sticker says that I should get 28 miles per gallon in the city and 34 for highway driving.  I�ve never checked myself, but I do notice that I fill my tank up much less frequently than my last car, a �94 Maxima. 

OTHER COOL STUFF:
Two-toned interior!  This looks so cool, but I don�t have it on my Celica because it�s black, but take a look at a red or blue one in the dealer and see what you think.  
Rear cup holders: I guess Toyota thinks this is more important to back-seat passengers than headroom.


WHAT ABOUT THE GT-S? 
I've been talking only about the GT because I feel that the GT-S is not worth the money.  Although if you are considering it, here's what you get: a 180 hp engine, the option of black leather (so no two-tone), the option of 5-star allow wheels which look even better than the GT wheels, a 6-speed manual transmission, and with an automatic transmission also comes an electronic sportshift that lets you upshift and downshift by pressing little buttons on the steering wheel: useless.  I feel that the GT is an amazing value, and the GT-S is not worth the money, but you decide for yourself.  

*MY OWN CELICA:
Here�s my little disclaimer.   I bought my 2000 Celica 4 months used, with 6200 miles on it.  It also had a few scratches on it cause I think that the kid I bought it from had ran it under a tree or something.  So therefore it cost me a little less, but does not change my recommendation.  


MY OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:
BUY THIS CAR!!!  If you�re in the market for anything &quot;sporty,&quot; whether it be a Maxima or an Integra, you must look at this car.  Take one for a test drive and you�ll see what I�ve been raving about.
