            Mid 2001 we decided to buy a digital camera for the family this holiday season.  I began to do research on how many megapixels and what kind of zoom.  I began asking friends for recommendations and their likes and dislikes about their digital cameras.  I was told to get at least 2MP,  allows for AC hookup during picture transfer and has an optical zoom.  The DX3600 is all of that and more.  

Although priced the same as the DX3700, the DX3600 has more features.  The DX3600 only has 2.2MP, but it also has the capability to make short digital films.  This and the optical zoom outweighed the 3.1MP on the DX3700.  The shutter lag, which I have heard is present on all digital cameras, took a little getting used to.  However, I am now taking pictures like a pro.  The learning curve is not steep at all.  It is like with any other well designed electronic device, play around with it for a couple of days before you pass judgment.

We bought the docking station to go with this and highly recommend it.  The rechargeable battery itself is worth it.  It does not allow you to take as many pictures as a normal battery, but it is rechargeable and has saved us money already.  We found the Kodak software which accompanies the camera is a little 'klunky' and once you look at the pictures using it, makes them difficult to email.  We are running Win98 on our machine.  Maybe ME or XP works better with it.  But be advised.

The amount we paid does not include the docking station.  But you can find package deals on the net for less than you could buy the two separately.  We also recommend you buy at least a 64MB memory card.  This allows us store about 90 pictures at the 'best' setting and about 350 at the 'good' setting.  The two quality settings are nice because they keep things simple.  Use the best setting if you are going to print your photos and good if you are simply going to email them.

The camera only receives 'good' marks below because this is not a pro level camera.  It is a great all around vacation and family photo op camera.  Good luck to all!
