            Camera:	Kodak DX3500 Digital Camera
Amount Paid:	$219.00
2.2 Mega Pixel, 38mm, w/ Docking Station and rechargable batteries

I purchased the Kodak DX3500 Digital Camera about a year ago and have no complaints at all!!  I love this camera!! I had ordered it online through Gateway.com. Once I received it in the mail, I began using it that day. It was very easy to learn how to use.  So easy, that my Mother just purchased one as well. I had Windows 2000 when I first started using it, and now I have Windows XP and it still works great. If you love to take pictures and love technology, then this is the camera for you!!

**About the Picture Quality**
The picture quality is fantastic!! It has 2.2 mega pixels, so even printed 8x10�s look great, as long as you use good photo paper and a good printer.  The camera comes with Kodak Picture Software so you can crop or get rid of red eye in photos before you print, send, or just use on your personal computer. It also comes with Kodak Memory Album software, where you can create you own memory album on your computer. 

**The Options**
�	When the camera is on, you can take pictures by looking through the window, or you can turn on the LED screen and see what you are taking a picture of live. This eats up the battery quicker, but it�s like having a video camera.
�	There is a Self Timer option, which is great for group shots!
�	You can manually delete photos you decide you do not want any more, one by one, or just delete the entire memory.
�	You can zoom in on a picture that you have already taken on the camera.
�	You can set the date to show up on the pictures.
�	You can lock pictures on the camera so that they are never accidentally deleted.
�	You can turn on the Slide Show on the camera so it will go through the entire memory of pictures and show you picture by picture.

**About The Batteries**
The batteries that came with it were not the rechargeable type but lasted me about 6 months.  It holds about 13-15 pictures on the best quality setting within the camera�s memory itself. You can purchase a Compact Flash Memory Card so you can save more pictures. I recently put in the rechargeable batteries and they don�t stay charged very long, but if you have the Kodak Docking Station plugged in you can have it charging while not in use.

I hope my review helps you!! :)
