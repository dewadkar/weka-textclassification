            I drove a Mazda 323 for twelve years.  It was incredibly reliable and economical, but utilitarian.  I was getting seriously bored with it, but the darn thing would just not die.

When I finally decided to get a new car I was certainly well-disposed to pick a Mazda again, but first looked at several others of the usual suspects in its category: Honda Civic, Toyota Echo, Dodge Neon.  (Although not the Ford Focus, which is also highly rated in independent reviews.)

But I fell in love with the Mazda Protege (which replaced the 323 model several years ago) the minute I took it for a test drive.  The seats are comfortable, the interior is roomy, the fit and finish are top-notch.  What really sets it apart though are the handling and responsiveness.  It drives like a much more expensive, sporty car.

I bought the LX version with all the options I could get.  (This is in Canada, where the top of the line is the LX.  In the US the top of the line is the ES, and the options are a little different.)  I got automatic transmission, air conditioning and the Touring Edition Package.  A CD player is standard, but I added on a cassette player too.

Keyless remote entry was not available as an option, which I found a little surprising, but I was able to get it as part of an aftermarket alarm system that I added.

The only thing I am not completely happy with is the level of wind noise at highway speeds.  I actually measured it with my handy-dandy Radio Shack sound level meter to be 73dB at 75 mph.  This compares to 68dB at the same speed in a Dodge Caravan.  The difference is very noticeable, especially if you are trying to listen to an audio book or have a conversation on a cell phone.  I don't know how this compares to other cars in its class, but reviews complain about the noise of a Neon, Focus, Kai, etc.

I have been driving my Protege for about seven months now and am completely happy with it.  I've never had a car before where I actually looked forward to driving it!<br><br>
