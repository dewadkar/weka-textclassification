            Alright, I'm definitely not a seasoned photographer by any stretch of the imagination. I do enjoy taking pictures, though. And lots of them. Until this past January, I always had crappy little point-and-shoot 35mm cameras. A roommate of mine had let me borrow his Toshiba digital, though and I was hooked immediately on the snappy access to pictures. 

I looked and looked and compared and hemmed and hawed about which digital camera to get and it came down to this: I wanted to be able to take BIG photos, I wanted to be able to take lots of smaller photos and I wanted to be able to mess with shutter speed, zoom and aperture (although I didn't know the correct word at the time (: ). 

After reading review upon review and using another roommate's G1 a few times, I made up my mind and ordered the bad boy up. 

It came standard with a 16Mb card and despite what the little display on the top of the camera says, you can definitely get more than 43 shots @ 1024x768. The number of exposures depends (I think) on how saturated with colour and objects your pictures are. 

I'm forever taking pictures on the go, so the LCD on the back is great for a quick glance before I start clicking away. Now, I've never actually used the view finder above the LCD, so I really can't say whether it's good or bad in relation to other cameras. I just know it's there. heh. 

The buttons and controls on the back of the camera are pretty self explanatory and I confess I've only ever opened up the manual that the camera came with once. And that was only to find out what aperture was and what it did. The dial on top that switches the camera between modes is also pretty easy to get a grasp on; I would just switch it around and start messing with the four-direction button on the back to see what changed on the LCD. 

I read another review that seemed not to be a fan of the G1s size (or ergonomics), but you know, that's one of my favourite things about it. It's small enough to keep in my bag (ALL the time), but it's big enough that I can't lose it too easily. I also like the weight of it. It's got a solid feel. I've used the canon s100 before and it was just way too light for me (I actually accidentally launched it out of my hands when I was spooked by a loud explosion. Oy!). I don't know much about ergonomics in terms of cameras, but I've been able to hold/position the G1 in a wide variety of ways (positions) and not found any of them to be overly uncomfortable or impossible. In fact it's not all that difficult to hold the camera and take pictures with just one hand (e.g. as opposed to clicking the shutter button with one and holding the butt of the camera with the other). 

The one thing that really irritates me about the camera is the time it takes between turning the camera to "ON" and the lens auto-focusing so you can start taking pictures. Even the time for the camera to wake up from the Auto Power Down is a little slower than I'd really like. 

Also in the camera's favour.. my mom actually DROPPED my camera (I heard a sickening clatter on the asphalt before I realized what was going on) from about four feet up and other than a small dent near the shutter button, the camera was fine. It took a while to work out the stickiness that found its way into the zoom adjuster (I didn't know what else to call it), but the camera seems no worse for the wear. (Although, now I don't let my mom near it. (: )

Aside from the start-up time, the only thing I'd wish bigger/more on the camera is the zoom lens. 3x just isn't always as much as I'd like, but then that could just be me. 

Lastly, I don't know how many people like to take pictures at concerts or in low lit rooms, but the M mode (which allows you to adjust both the aperture and the shutter speed to compensate for lighting) on the camera is perfect for snapping fairly high quality shots without blinding the artists with a flash and so forth. (Although, this is probably a mode found on most if not all digital cameras, I thought I'd mention it. (: )
