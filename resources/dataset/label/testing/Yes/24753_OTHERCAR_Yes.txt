            I was initially in the market for transportation with good fuel economy. After driving the compact offerings from all the major players, including the civic, corolla, and cavalier, I was dissatisfied with the lack of highway pep from them all. (I drive a V8 Jeep Cherokee). The Sentras had the best rebates at the time, but I hated the checkerboard interiors of the lower end models. Although I was initially turned off by the 28 mpg gas range of the SER, I knew I had to compromise a bit if I didn't want to get killed pulling into an intersection.

The car appears to be well built, but I did notice some grinding from the roters during the first 500 miles. It has since subsided. I didn't get the ABS, but in the snow it beats the 4wd jeep in stopping since it's so light. I'd recommend against ABS, unless you get an insurance discount.

The radio is another option for a few hundred more, but I opted for the cheaper one, knowing I could get my own installed for muck less. The factory 180 watt is average at best, and the controls are pretty awkward. Definately not for the habitual channel changer that I am.

Millage is good - around the 30 mpg range.

Ride is very rough, which I suppose is the result of a "sport" suspension. You feel every pothole, and you feel like you're abusing your new car when traveling down a street that's just been tared in the joints of the cement. Highway isn't all that bad, and not a ton of road noise.

The engine shines, and is the best aspect of this car. Plenty of pep, and combines with the weight, will hold its own, if you're into that sort of thing.

Don't be fooled by the dual exhaust tip, as that's all it is, a chrome tip. It's really a single exhaust.
