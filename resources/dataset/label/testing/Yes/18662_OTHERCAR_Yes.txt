            Yes, I was one of those people who said they would never drive a minivan.  In fact after our first child was born I quite effectively talked my husband out of buying one.  After showing him how small the cargo area was in the back and how hard it was to get to the third seat he was convinced too.  Now, 3 and a half years later I have convinced him that the Odyssey is the way to go, and we both absolutely LOVE this van!!

I was ready to get something a little bigger than my `98 Ford Explorer, so that occasional passengers other than the two kids could ride along with us (or any future children that might arrive).  So we considered an SUV with the third seat.  But we soon realized that any SUV with the third seat had hardly any cargo room - except for the Suburban, which was a little TOO big for my taste.  Also, these third row seats that could be added seemed to be very small and uncomfortable.  And once I realized that getting to a car seat in that third row would be a pain in the you-know-what, we decided this wouldn't work for us after all. 

Because my friend had an Odyssey and I remembered how much room it had in the rear, with it's sunken 'well' we decided to test drive one.  Fortunately the dealership had one to drive and we were both impressed. We still were hesitant about spending almost $30,000 on a minivan, so I kept researching.  After reading a lot of information about the Honda, I decided this was definitely what I wanted so we took the plunge.  I have been driving my silver 2002 Odyssey for almost 4 months now, and here is what I think:

Power Doors

I LOVE these!  I know some people say they're too slow or too dangerous, but I think they are much safer than the manual doors that have to be slammed shut.  I love that the doors move at a slow, steady pace - my 2 and 4 year old boys have not had any problems, in fact it's nice that my 4 year old can work the door by himself, and I don't have to worry about him abusing it by slamming the door or closing it on himself or anything else.  The beeping sound you get if you try to open the locked doors is annoying, but I can live with it.  I love that I can open and close the doors from the drivers seat using the buttons on the dash, or I can use my remote control.  

The Remarkable Magic Seat!

I love, love, love the folding third row seat!  I would not have bought a minivan at all if it did not have this feature, because for me, the third row is not always needed, and I love the flexibility of being able to create more cargo room anytime, anywhere.  The third row seat easily folds down into the cargo well creating a flat cargo space.  I have put many things back there - coffee tables, shelves, and a new screen door.  I especially love to flip the third row seat into the 'tailgating' position to change a diaper on the go.  When the seat is upright, the 'well' the seat folds down into is a huge cargo area... I can fit all my groceries back there, my double stroller can lay flat in the area or stand upright to make room for other things, and a trip to Costco is no match for the Odyssey! 

Safety Features

I am so pleased that my Odyssey offers the LATCH system for installing car seats in the captains chairs.  It is a simpler way to install car seats, especially if you have a new car seat that also has the LATCH system.  My convertible forward facing car seat is installed using a LATCH retrofit kit which means my seat installs without using the seat belt.  This allows for a tighter more secure fit, and no seat belt straps blocking the way to the back if you have the two captains chairs pushed together.  Tether anchors are also on the captains chairs.  The Odyssey also has headrests and shoulder belts for ALL seating positions - a big safety feature.

Easy Access, Easy to Drive

I can move about in my Odyssey quite easily without ever getting out.  The folding tray in between the two front seats makes getting to the back simple.  Some would argue that this folding tray should be a storage compartment, but I like being able to clear the aisle so I can get to the back easily.  It is also easy to get to the third seat when the captains chairs are separated.  I hate the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped behind the second row of seats, but having the middle aisle access makes the back row much more open.  I have no problem buckling my 4 year old into his car seat when he is sitting in the very rear.  

The best thing about driving the Odyssey is that I feel like I'm in a car again.  My Explorer was so truck-like in it's handling, but this van is smooth and comfortable.  I find it no harder to park or maneuver than any other vehicle I've driven.  Some have complained about road noise, but I haven't found it to be noticeable.  

One more thing worth mentioning is the radio controls on the steering wheel.  You can control the volume of the radio and either flip through the preselected stations on the tuner, or the tracks on your CD.  It's a handy feature that I use quite often now that I remember it's there!

Cons:

These are actually quite petty, but there are a few minor annoyances.  

The sound quality is not great.  I had read this before I got mine, and once I turned on the radio I realized what was meant by saying it sounded 'tinny'.  It's something I don't even think about now, though since I've gotten used to it.

The 'tilt' wheel is not much of a tilt at all!  Both my husband and I have noticed this and wish it were more adjustable (the wheel doesn't come very far down), but we have adjusted fine.

There doesn't seem to be enough supply and the dealers seem to use this to their advantage.  We went through an auto broker so we didn't have to deal with the salesmen's tactics, but we still had to wait 3 or 4 weeks for our van, and I didn't get the color I wanted because it would have been even longer.  

I wanted it all, and I got it - room for passengers besides my two children, lots of cargo room, and the flexibility of the folding rear seat.  I would buy this van all over again, and my husband who balked at spending this kind of money on a 'minivan' swears it's the best money he ever spent!  In fact he has gone on to convince many others they should buy the Odyssey too.  I second that!
