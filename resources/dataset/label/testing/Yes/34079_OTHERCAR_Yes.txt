            I'm gonna keep this short and not bore you with a lot of specs that you've probably already looked up. I bought this camera after much deliberation and price watching, and I am thoroughly pleased with this camera. The resolution is great, pictures are very clear, colors accurate. The video mode which you can replay on the camera on on the computer using QuickTime is interesting- especially if you want to e-mail someone with a video clip. It's got 32 megs of internal RAM which helps you take several pictures rapidly (then it writes them to the SmartMedia Flash Card). when printed on my HP 932 inkjet, the results are bright and clear. No "noise" in the pictures like you see with so many HP cameras.

Some things I'd recommend to you if you do plan on getting this camera: 

1)Get AA NiMH rechargeable batteries. This is a high drain device and alkalines won't cut it. I got a couple of sets of GP 1800 mAh batteries and a rapid recharger and have been very pleased with how long they last even with the LCD running, red eye flash mode on, and frequent zooming in and out.

2) Get a 64 MB SmartMedia card. When you're taking hi res pictures, you can use up the measly 16 MB card they ship with the camera pretty quickly.

3) Check CNET.com for a listing of the lowest prices being offered by online retailers- I got a super good deal!!
