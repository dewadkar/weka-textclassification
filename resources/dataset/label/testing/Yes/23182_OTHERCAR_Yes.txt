            This is absolutely the car for you.  Whether you are a single person who picks up friends and takes them to a movie, or a family person who has kids and a dog to drive around, this is the car for you.  The Honda Accord is well worth the money we pay.  It is economical on gas, very comfortable no matter where you go, and has the smoothest ride you can imagine.  I know I own one.  I would not trade my Honda Accord for anything else.  I have never had a problem with it, even though I bought it used.  I knew I was getting a good car.

You don't have to get up in the morning to go to work and worry about it not turning on.  I would recommend this car to anyone!<br><br>
