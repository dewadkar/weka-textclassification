            My e-pinion on this car is one that has been formed after owning after a year and a half.  To put it very simply, I love my Grand Am.  My parents bought my 1994 green Grand Am for me in August of 1998 when I started college.  They also got the warranty to go along with it which was a waste of money because it has only been to the shop once since have had it.  The reason it went seemed to be a pretty common problem.  I am not a mechanic but I think it was the coil or coil cover.  Anyway, my warranty has recently ran out because of the number of miles I have put on it,(hint: I have put a lot of miles on this car) and I have been contemplating trading it in for a car with a warranty but having a car payment or keep it with no car payment and no warranty.  My decision has become clear that I will keep this car because I would miss it.  It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven or ridden in.  It is roomy without being a big car.  The trunk is a pretty good size too.  I have a four door and it is the best.  Another good thing to point out,although I would not recommend trying this and hope it never happens to you, is that is your are rear ended there is only small amount of damage done and you would actually have to look for the damages.  It holds up really well because the car that hit me looked really bad.  When this happened my car did have to get fixed and I was provided with a rental car which was a brand new Cavalier and I hated that car.  So this only enhanced my love for this car.  I also like the fact that even though it is a four cylinder it has a good bit of power.  The reason I am writing this e-pinion is to inform all of you perspective car buyers what a great car I have and I would strongly suggest any one to buy it.<br><br>
