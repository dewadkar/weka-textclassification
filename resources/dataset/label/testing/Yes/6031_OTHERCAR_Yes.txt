            It has been over 10 years since I purchased a new car. I wanted to make an informed decision. The following includes a summary of what I found.
Complaints I found while reading reviews (including Consumer Reports, JD Power, Cartrackers.com, Edmund's, and a few others). The following were the complaints; I will follow the complaints by my opinion as to the validity of each complaint.
1. The car's fit and trim (The gaps between the body panels are a bit larger than other cars, which may account for the added wind noise. The larger gaps are in part due to the needed room for the polymer body panels.)
2. Wind noise around the car. (The car does have more wind noise when compared to other cars in its class, but it is not pronounced.)
3. The noise of the 4 cylinder engine. (The 4-cylinder engine has a timing chain, which does cause additional sound compared to the 6 cylinder, which has a timing belt. The 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power.)
4. The placement of the window controls. (This is simply personal preference, the window controls are located in the center console and not on the doors.)
5. The firmness of the seats. (The seats are comfortable, over a very long drive the seats may seem a bit hard because of being firm. The car was designed by GM in Germany, and Europeans tend to like firm seats.)
6. The ride of the car. (Again this is personal opinion, I found the ride firm and steady. In fact, I like the way the car rides.)
7. The looks or design of the car. (Some people found the design of the car not impressive, which is again personal preference.)

Somethings of interest:
JD Power rates the Saturn L as one of the highest rated cars for initial quality (for the 2001 models).

While looking at the Saturn cars, I mentioned to the sales person some of my concerns about the car based on what I had read in the different reviews. The sales person took me to the service manager and I freely asked questions and he candidly answered all of the questions. He was open and honest about comments about the car he had heard from owners. 
 
The things that I would change about the car:
1. Some of the controls of the CD Player including the volume.
2. The placement of the rear window causes a blind spot for low objects that are behind you. (See below for changes in the 2003 L)
3. The front seats. Some might find that it requires a bit more effort then normal to get out of the seat.
4. The adjustable lumbar support is only in the drivers seat and not in the front passenger seat.
5. The lighted vanity mirror is located on the driver's visor. The passenger vanity mirror is not lighted. 
6. The lack of advertising by Saturn about the car. It's a great car.

Things I really like about the car:
1. I very much like how the car rides.
2. The gas mileage is very good for a family size car.
3. The sound system is awesome. In fact, my wife has an Infiniti QX4 with a Bose sound system in it and she likes the sound of my sound system better than her Bose system.
4. The spacious trunk.
5. The heated leather front seats. 

Features of my car: 
Safety Features: 3 Year/36,000 Mile Ltd Warranty, 24 hr Roadside Assistance.
Comfort/Convenience: Air Conditioning w/Filtration, AM/FM Stereo CD with 8 Speakers and in dash CD changer, Power Locks and Windows, Cruise Control, Fold-Down Rear Seats (60/40), Anti-Lockout Protection, Driver Seat Height Adjuster, Rear Armrest w/Cupholders, Front and Rear Carpeted Floor Mats, Tilt Steering Wheel, Heated Front Seats, Lower lumbar adjustments for front seats, leather seats/trim.

Functional Performance: 2.2L DOHC 16 Valve 4 Cylinder Engine, 4 speed Automatic Transmission, Oil Change Notification, Anti-lock brakes with Traction Control, 4 Wheel Disc Brakes, 4 Wheel Independent Suspension.

Overall I am very pleased with my new car. 

July 2002 update ... we took the car on a vacation and drove around 2,000 miles ... still very pleased with the car. The 4 cylinder ran great loaded with 4 adults and luggage while driving through the mountains of GA, TN and KY.

Current 2004 L300 series changes from the 2002 L:
1. The front end has been raised.
2. The back end has been lowered a bit.
3. The head lights and the front quarter panels have been changed. 
4. The trail lights have been modified a bit.
5. The spoiler is no longer available.
6. The car has additional sound deadening material so that the ride is quieter.
7. The L300 1 is like the L200 of past years. The difference of the L300 2 and 3 are trim levels.

After owning the car now for 2 years, I still very much like my car.
