            I did not want to do this, I did not want to buy a digital camera!  My wife brought me into the Twentyfirst century with this wonderful camera, simply because we have two little boys, folks who would like to see pictures of them, and she got tired of scanning!  Reading other reviews on the Minolta Dimage 2300, we got a good camera at a great price, now under $200!

I am not a technology wonk.  Simply, it cannot be too difficult or else I lose interest or I break the sucker.  I usually have the best of intentions but sometimes there is a "shortcut" or I'm smarter than the instructions.  Fortunately, neither was the case with the Minolta.  As I mentioned, we were looking for a digital with download capabilities, with simple instructions.  The Dimage 2300 fit most of the bill.

The price is now excellent, under $200.  Of course, the technology is old, over three years old, but it works.  The camera does use a ton of batteries, so always have plenty on hand.  It uses 4 AA size, so the good news is, the replacement batteries are not some exotic size, found only in the Himalaya Mountains.  It has a built in flash with the usual 35 mm options to prevent red eye and auto flash.It has a focus lamp for viewing, plus an easy to use focus finder and back viewing for a live view.  Macro pictures can be used for smaller items and objects, along with a nice auto self-timer for you to get in the pictures!

Record menues allows image capturing and improved quality, truthfully, I have not messed with this aspect of the camera.  If you have some special indoors shots, this can adjust for lighting and sharpness, if the need moves you.

We have the standard 8 MB card memory capacity, great for downloading just a few family pictures or ebay items.  For the real serious digital experience, you will need more memory.  I can get 24 standard full size images with the card.  

The play mode is easy to view the photos.  Easy instructions move you around the 24 images with the push of a few buttons.  Easy!  There is an easy delete of the unwanted images, a save protector of wanted pictures and an easy to use print option.  There is a date option for the prints, too.

The software to view, print, and download the images is easy to use, too.  Simple, with a USB connection.  While I had problems finding the right port to use, my duckling wife had no problems.  She also uses Adobe Photoshop for her prints.  They look great for our home use.  Again, we are not professionals nor do we want that time and expense.  This is a nice little camera!

For the complete idiot, me, I can view the images, download them easily to email, website, or ebay.  I can delete them in a breeze!  I can connect the camera to the computer, need I say more?

If you are looking for a real professional look, then spend a bit more money on modern technology.  If you want a good digital for your personal use, this camera is worth a look!  All I have to do before complaining about it not working is checking to see if it is turned on!  Thank you for reading!
