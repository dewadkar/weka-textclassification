            I've read just about every review on epinion regarding the 2000 Windstar, and I noticed that many of the people making their observations were people that rented the vehicle. Gimme a break, how much can you know about a vehicle in a weeks time? And rental vehicles are abused and misused, so their performance is no true testament to the vehicle. 

In spite of the reviews I read before buying my Windstar, I went out and test-drove one. I have no depth perception, and this made driving most minivans nearly impossible. However, the Windstar drives like my Toyota Celica I had a few years back, and loved to death (literally... 425k miles on the baby til she had to be put to sleep). 

I will admit to being a FORD fan, and have many of them in my driveway, and have never had an ounce of trouble with one of them, so all the doom sayers can buzz off. I've owned Fords for over 25 years, and never was left stranded by one of them. 

Anyway, back to the Windstar... this vehicle is gorgeous on the outside and inside. It drives like a dream. Quiet ride, smooth shifting, lots and lots of pick up (I gave my husband my 1995 V-8 Thunderbird when we got this van, so I like my ability to zoom when needed), and very comfortable. 

The only downfall I can see on this vehicle is no bucket seats in the back. But seeing how easily I can get in and out of it, this is acceptable. 

There's no stepping up to get into the back, no sliding door that isn't wide enough or too heavy to close when seated. The dual door also allows for both my kids to climb in at the same time, stopping the shoving match before it can begin. 

Head room! I'm 5'10" and have a 6'3" son, and both of us are sick of vehicles were our heads touch the headliner. Not in this van! Plenty of head, leg, arm, and seat room. I'm not a tiny lady, and I'm tired of seats made for petite dewdrops, and seatbelts that barely fit around my skinny 10 year old. Us full figured gals can fit into this van with ease, and we don't feel like we just put on a girdle! 

All and all this van is a total plus! It brakes with ease, drives with ease, parks with ease and is dang pretty too! So take it from a disabled full figured gal that's very picky, this van is a winner!

UPDATE JUNE, 2003:  I've owned this vehicle for over a year now, and I have no complaints.  I'm not really the soccer/mini-van Mom, type, but this fan has style.  The only draw back to this van, my husband swiped it from me cuz of the good gas mileage to and from his work.  He bought me a cadillac to replace the van, so I'm not complaining.

A YEAR LATER:  

Would I buy this van again?  Yes.

ANY CONS?  Yes, Ford resell value is horrible.  You will be upside down in this vehicle for a long time to come.  So if you're going to buy it, plan on keeping it for the length of the loan.  Another con... hubby took the van!

ANY PROS?  Oh yes!  I never have to worry when I drive my kids in this van, it won't leave me stranded, and it's rolling security.  I'm damn secure of myself in this van.

All I can tell ya ppl, don't give into this foreign car sales bologna.  Support your country with a Ford, and know you've bought a damn nice vehicle.  I know, I've owned Fords since I was a kid, and not once have I ever been left stranded.

End of story.
