            My wife and I looked around for something practical, sporty, and comfortable and looking for something under $35,000. We've typically owned Audi's, BMW's or Infiniti's in the past and looked at Volvo as being comparable to the driving characteristics and quality found in these makes. We have since found this to be only partially true. At the time of purchase, we compared the VW Passat, Audi A4, Saab 9-3 5 door &amp; 9-5 wagon, Volvo V70 wagon, and Subaru Legacy Wagon. BMW had not yet released the 3 series wagon. The Audi and Saabs were very appealing, but the closest dealership was an hour and a half away and were ruled out due to lack of nearby service facilities. The Passat was all right, but lacked pizazz. It has more character than an Accord or Camry, but it seemed every bit as boring as those two with its muted color offerings and pedestrian image. The V70 wagon was in a transition stage and both the older 2000 V70 and new 2001 V70 were scarce to find on a lot anywhere (unless you like powder blue or the gold that Volvo is trying to push). The Subaru was appealing with its AWD, but had an uncomfortably low seating position. We ultimately decided on a fully loaded Volvo V40. The front seats are terrific if you are tall and appreciate a more upright seating position. If you can afford it, I would highly recommend the leather seats and cold weather package. The leather is extremely comfortable and looks great while the heated seats and traction control that is included in the cold weather package do a fine job. With this being a turbocharged FWD car with a healthy amount of torque right off the line, I've noticed that the traction control system really helps out when taking off on slippery surfaces. Around the town handling is above average and is predictable on curves and at highway speeds. Acceleration is adequate and the brakes do a fine job (but create a huge amount of brake dust that requires cleaning the wheels weekly). For an automatic transmission, this one does a good job of matching the cars small turbo engine with smooth and predictable shifting. The transmission's sport mode makes a noticeable difference in how it reacts to your right foot. However, I do wish that the car was available with either a manual or a tiptronic style transmission. Also, in the summer, the automatic AC does a good job of cooling the car down quickly, but strangely, the heater sometimes takes a while to warm up in the winter time unlike Audi or BMW (this coming from a car company that is based in a cold area like Sweden).

Now a couple of gripes. The back seat is cramped and is really only for 2 people. Whoever is sitting in the back seats have a completely blocked view compliments of the front headrests (so if they get carsick real easy, have them sit in the front). The stereo is not anywhere near the quality it should be to justify the high price (on ours, it was included in a package. Otherwise, it would be a $800 option). The Bose systems on Audi's and Infiniti's and the Harmon Kardon systems on BMW's blow this crappy system away. The cargo area is all right, but could stand to have a wider and lower opening. At highway speeds, wind noise is quite evident. The engine starts and runs fine, but always seems a bit rough and never as smooth as an Infiniti's or BMW's. My biggest complaint is with the quality of some of the components and build quality. Squeaks and rattles are abundant and it has been back to the shop 5 times for everything from constant static coming from a speaker to air bubbles that were trapped in the plastic on one of the outside mirrors (both of which should have been caught by the QA dept. at the factory). Now my biggest concern is will this hold its value as well as the Audi A4 that I almost purchased.

After purchasing one, you will be bombarded with the usual and annoying follow-up customer courtesy calls. And unlike Infiniti or some other manufacturers, it's a chore to get a courtesy car while it's in the shop to repair manufacturer defects. 

Overall, if you are looking for something with character and personality, that is comfortable for 2 front seat passengers, and has a little extra room in the rear to store things, this is the perfect car. <br><br>
