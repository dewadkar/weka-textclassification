            We bought this car mostly due to our GM discount, but what a great purchase!  Had it now for 1-year (traded in the 95' Altima which I kept for over 6 yrs I loved it so much) and it's been a great vehicle in many ways.  The ride is fantastic, wonderful size and comfort in front or back seats.  We have fit 6 adults in this car & they all felt it was very comfy.  We went with the "fully-stocked" model with leather & sunroof, etc.  Only thing not purchased was On-Star, which we would have it it weren't for the pricetag of this feature.  The car has proven to be very durable, dealer (Kennesaw, GA) has given great service & we've had no issues with maintenance/parts/etc.  One recall on a small part & it was not a safety or performance related part & it was fixed easily at dealership (GM notified us in a very timely manner).  Gets decent gas mileage (sticker claim or better), plenty of headroom & legroom all around.  LATCH system for child restraint products & our 7-week old seems very content with the ride!  Also love the stereo buttons on the steering wheel, helps keep eyes on the road.  Happy that we went with the bench seat style as it make for true 6-person capacity.
