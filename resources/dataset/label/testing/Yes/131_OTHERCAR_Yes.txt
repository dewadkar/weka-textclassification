            I looked at cameras for  about three weeks.  The ones i found in my price ranged in price from about $500 and down.  Most of the ones i found which had good to average quality were in the $400-500 price range.  This little camera had all that plus it came with free floppy smart media adapter for a low $249.  If you are looking for a camera that can replace you current 35mm then this is the one.  The only thing extra you will need to buy is a 32mb memory card for additional storage.  If you a going to get you pictures developed you need to take the pictures at average quality or better.  With the 4MB cartridge this camera comes with you can only store 12 pictures at the average quality and 4 on the high quality.  Even though if you're an ametuer photographer and you looking for the camera that gives you the most bang for your buck then this is the camera for you.  Simply put<br><br>
