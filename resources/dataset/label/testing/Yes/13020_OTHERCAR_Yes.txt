            After much research and many visits to showrooms, my husband and I decided to purchase the 2000 Volvo S80 2.9.  Months before I had first seen the new model while driving my old Maxima to work, and fell in love with the car.  It looked unique and very classy.  I also knew that Volvos were reputed to be the safest cars around, and so I convinced my husband that this was our new car!

My experience since then has been one of ups and downs, with an equal balance of both in the four months we've owned this car.  I should hasten to say that most of my disappointments have revolved around small issues - created for the most part by my dealership, but have nonetheless given my husband and I many headaches.

It all started when we picked up the car.  There was a strange humming noise that continued after the engine was turned off.  Our agent assured us that it was the sound of the engine cooling, but we later discovered that this was an incorrect evaluation.  We took the car back to the dealer and they said that it must be the radio.  They put a new radio in and left the car outside for us.  We came to pick it up, delighted to have our car back, and discovered that the humming noise was still there.  In addition, the mechanics had damaged the interior of the car, which meant that we had to bring it back to be repaired again.

After two or three more trips to the shop, we finally had our car back, but then we heard a squeaking noise coming from the glove compartment.  We took it to them, they returned it and the car squeaked on.  Also, the stripes from the gold package that they had installed started to peel off, the rubber seal thingamajig from the front of the car started to fall off, as did the rubber guards on the doors that are to protect them from damage.  We also had to have the faulty trip computer replaced.

We've been back to the dealership at least five times in the past four months, and we have another trip scheduled.  Things are falling off the car and it still squeaks around the glove compartment.  

My honest opinion, however, is that it is a great car.  I love to drive it, and I plan on keeping it forever.  As I said, my problems have mostly been small things that show the incompetence of my dealership more than the true quality of the car.  The car has a smooth ride, is very luxurious, and definitely eye-catching.  It takes a while to go from 0-60, but once it gets there it performs well.  So far I'm loving it, but hating all of my trips to the dealership.

I wish you better luck with yours.<br><br>
