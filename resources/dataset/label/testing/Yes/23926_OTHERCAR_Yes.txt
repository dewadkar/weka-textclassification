            Not much you  can you say bad about this car.  It has amazing features.  The breaks are amazing, and can stop on a dime.  The traction, as well is great, so you could take turns going 70 mph.  Don't get me started about the acceleration  I'm serious, but don't worry, I've never done that.  The fact that it is a hard top only makes it batter.  In 15 seconds, the car &quot;morphs&quot; from a small, hard top sports car, to an open air speed machine.  With winter coming on, the top will probably be closed, and that is what the built in seat heaters are for.  Seriously, these things heat up in 5 seconds, that's pretty good for any car.
    The only possible thing that is bad about the car is its steep price, but what do you expect, for one of the best cars in the world.  Also, the fact that it is only a two seater means that it can't be a family car.  Besides these, however, this car is the best I have ever driven!<br><br>
