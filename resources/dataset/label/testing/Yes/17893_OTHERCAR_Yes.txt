            I had done through research before I settled on this car. I ruled out the American made because of their lack of refinement. MB and BMW are not very reliable. They are also clearly priced at the premium. This left me with the Japanese three: Acura RL, Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45. 

The Q45 is nice, luxury and outstanding value (given the huge discount at the moment), but I really didn't like the way the transmission shifts. Admitted the LS400 is a better car than the RL. It is a little quicker, a litter softer, a little quieter and a lot more prestige. But I chose the RL over for two reasons. One is the understated look of RL, cause show off is never part of my personality. The other the $15000 difference in price. I just don't see the little advantage of LS400 worth that much.

I practically like almost every aspect of the RL. It has room and very refined quality. The drive is quite soft and quiet, but driver clearly can feel the pavement he is driving on (not like those boats in the Cad and Buick lineup). On highway, you can do 90 miles and still enjoy every bit of the music came out of the outstanding BOSE speakers.

The thing I dislike the car is actually not the car itself. IMO, The Acura dealer is clearly under par when compared to the ones of Lexus and Infiniti. Luckily Acura built their car very reliable, so I don't need to see those service manager often.

If you want the luxury, like the car to be reliable and have some discretionary income to throw around, the RL makes a perfect choice. It does not turn heads on the road. It does everything effectively and effortlessly. It is just the go without show.<br><br>
