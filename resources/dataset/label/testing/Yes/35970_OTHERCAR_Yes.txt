                I have been looking for a compact automobile for about a month, and researched all cars available around $16,000.  There were many automobiles in this price range, and it can be quite difficult in differentiating each.  Like most car buyers some of the qualities that were most important to me were comfort, design, efficient gas mileage, and great warranty.  The Nissan Altima was a slightly more expensive car than the Honda Civic with the similar options.  However, the Nissan Altima did have a more sporty appearance than the Honda Civic.  A main reason that I decided to eliminate the Nissan Altima was the very fact that a close friend of mine has many mechanical problems with his 1999 Altima.  The power door locks were malfunctioning after only 5,000 miles and the transmission had some gear changing problems.  It might have been that my friend's Altima was a defect, but I could not take the chance.  All in all the Honda Civic appealed much more than some other cars in this class.  The Civic EX model come standard with a sunroof, which is really important to me =).  I decided to opt for the standard 5-spd transmission, because of the $1,250 deduction in overall price.  The EX that I purchased had full power options and I have yet to have any problems with this vehicle after 12,000 miles.  When dealing with the Honda Salesman, I was very agressive, and found an attractive price of $15,850 before taxes.  This fell right within my price range, and it will be a part of my life for years to come.  The power is sometimes slightly weaker than I would like, but then again what more can you expect from a compact automobile.  For commuting purposes this car is ideal, and handling is amazing.  Especially for female drivers, I feel this car offers many ammenities and comfort options.  Well hope this is helpful.
