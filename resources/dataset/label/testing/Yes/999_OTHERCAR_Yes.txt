            I took delivery of my Matrix FWD Base Model (With Package B) yesterday, and let me tell you, it's amazing I'm even able to sit in my chair and write this review.  Little toyota touches make this vehicle a real winner.  From the little storage pockets found virtually everywhere, right down to the automatically dimming dome lights, I am continually amazed at the little extra features that Toyota has packed into this car.  I have read reviews of this car that called it sluggish and unresponsive, however, I have found the 1.8 litre Yamaha engine paired with the manual 5-speed transmission to be more than peppy, and the lack of cabin noise actually makes it difficult to stay at or below the speed limit. In the interior, there is so much headroom, you could have a party in it!  Not only that, but the factory stereo was much better than anticipated, all Matrix models come standard with a AM/FM/CD Stereo that is Digital radio ready.  Although I removed this deck almost immediately after purchasing the vehicle, I was amazed with the quality of the sound.  The included speakers were more than adaquate enough to satisfy my tastes, and sound great with the aftermarket JVC KD-SH909 that I purchased for it.  With the added benefit of the red backlit dash perfectly matching the red backlit buttons on the deck!!!

I am heavily biased in my review, as I have been waiting for my matrix to arrive for about 5 months, and time will be the judge as to how reliable this car will be going in to the future, however, if the toyota name is any indication, this car will be a family heirloom for generations to come!
