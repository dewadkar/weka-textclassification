            After getting over the shock of the biggest lemon weve ever owned ('95 Ford Contour) my wife and i went car shopping.
For us the cars warranty was a very big issue.
And Hyundai has one that is second to none.
What suprized us was that for the price, this is a very good car.
Even disregarding the price!
I like the styling, it's modern yet traditionally appealing.
The front end reminds me of older Jaguars with its oval grill and slightly swept back headlights.
It's not the high zoot model, but it has all of that models options.
2.5L V6, air, cruise, pw, pl, am-fm-cd, 15" alum wheels -w- Michelin radials, and 4 wheel disc brakes.
The V6 is very peppy, but seems to lack a bit in the low range.
IE: it's no drag racer.  Once rolling though it winds out very well.
And -w- its P205-60-15 Michelin radials it handles great!
I sometimes find myself getting a little too agressive when taking it down to the grocery store......shhhhh dont tell the wife!  ;-D
The seats are comfortable and the controls are well placed and easy to use.
Plenty of room both front and rear.
My oldest son is 6'4" tall and can stretch out comfortably in the back seat!
Also plenty of trunk space , but nothing exceptional.
The car now has about 36,000 miles on the odometer and the only problem so far has been a bad LF window motor.
(which Hyundai replaced within 3 days of its failure.)
Would i recommend this car?
Absolutely!
In fact it so impressed me with it's capabilities...
(Hyundai are you listening???)
That i would like to see a "sport" or "GTi" model.
How about a 3L V6 -w- about 275bhp, 16" rubber, all wheel drive, and revised suspention and body panels???
(front air dam, rear spoiler/wing.)
How bout it Hyundai?
I'll buy that one for ME!!
