            I bought a year old 1996 Taurus Wagon (lease return) in December of 1996 and purchased the extended warranty offered by the dealer. The car had around 46 km on it when I got it, so I had original warranty plus extended. I have had few problems except for the transmission which was replaced under the warranty at no cost to me. 
Usual stuff -- tires, brakes (not cheap as this car has disc brakes all around), this and that mostly covered by warranty. Replacing a sensor is a ridiculous expense in a modern car (nearly $300 to have the ENGINE NEEDS SERVICE SOON light not bug you). 
I rate this car highly as I was in a major accident (T-boned) and both myself and my daughter were unharmed (on drivers side). 

Keeping cars running is a more and more expensive proposition. The car is full of features and is very convenient. I cross my fingers not to have major problems of this or that kind... I can surely empathize with the other reviewers... It is very expensive to repair major things in new cars.. I remember when a tranny could be fixed for under a thousand... not nowadays.. 

With respect to warranties,, I had a bad experience with another car from a  used car dealer offering a warranty from a firm which turned out to be part of the same group.. The adjuster was always fighting to get parts cheaper. It was a real hassle. Dishonest and slimey ...

I suggest htat when you get a car, check out the dealer and see what kind of reputation they have. My dealer made sure that I got full value for my warranty. Sometimes they would do things for me without any charge if their service staff didn't inform me or did something that wasn't quite according to Hoyle (for example, not changing a brakelight bulb because they couldn't contact me for approval -- that was a freebie done on the spot).

I don't know how the Taurus are going to work out in the long run. So far so good for me. Car manufacturers are nuts if they don't provide reasonable warranty coverage... and large firms such as GE Capital do themselves huge damage by not honouring warranties reasonably. I am always amazed at how these firms spend millions of dollars in advertising and promotion and then throw it away by treating people badly. They should take the good with the bad... profits on the overall way they work and eat the losses while looking after the customer.. Would I buy a car again from my dealer? Absolutely... A Ford?  Depends on the market and the quality. Taurus... so far so good.. <br><br>
