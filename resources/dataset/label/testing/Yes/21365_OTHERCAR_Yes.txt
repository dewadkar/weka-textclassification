            Toyota's ever-popular Camry is one of the best-selling sedans in the country. There are many reasons for its success, including interior space, The current models available for a Camry are the CE, LE, and XLE. The CE model, which is the one that my father has purchased, is the bottom line of the Camry. It is however, not a cheap car.  It looks mostly the same as any other model, however it does not have the luxury options of the V6 engine and leather seats and such, as the LE, and XLE has. 

The CE looks mostly the same as the other models on the outside.  It is sleek looking because of its long, low to the ground appearance.  One thing about this car that is bad, is the fact that its windows are so long and low to the ground. Because of this aspect of the car, there is no water treads on the oustide of the windows, so donï¿½t try opening them while your car is wet, or the inside will get soaked.  

As I have said before, the one thing that makes the CE model so different from the LE and XLE is the inside.  The comfort is not as good, as well as the no leather, no power seats, and not great stereo system.  For my father however, it serves its purpose.  It is just as solid and quiet as the other models of the Camry.  

The Toyota Camry CE model is a great car considering that it is not very high priced.  It is done very simply, but done right!
