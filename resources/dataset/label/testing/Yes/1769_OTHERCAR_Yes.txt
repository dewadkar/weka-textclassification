                I bought a 1997 Sebring just for show.  Everyone kept telling me how dangerous a convertiable car was.  I didn't listen!  Well I was lucky enough to be in one when I lost control in the rain and rolled.  I was going about fifty when I started sliding.  The car slid on drivers side rolled over top and then slid on passenger side.  Both passenger and I climbed out of totaled car with no injuries.  Well a lot of sore muscles the next day.  Minor to deal with.  If you were to look at the car you would never believe we got out without a scratch.  I was very impressed with the safety.  Do not forget the summers in this car are priceless.  The only thing I hated was winter because it was too cold too put the top down.  I recommend this car to all.  I think I'm even going to buy another one. <br><br>
