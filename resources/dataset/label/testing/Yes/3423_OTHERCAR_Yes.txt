I recently purchased a black on black CLK 430.  It is a V8 engine, with 275 horsepower.  To be honest, it is a perfect automobile.  The strength of the engine is evident at all speeds, coming off the line at a red light and cruising in the left lane on the highway.  It is a muscular car but always maintains the smoothness that Mercedes is known for.  the interior is well organized, especially the integrated phone, which should be a standard safety feature in all cars.  The back seats are deceptively comfortable.  In a trip to Montreal from Boston, two large sized people sat comfortably.  through and through, it is an excellent automobile.  It is a tad expensive, whihch would force some to opt for the CLK 32o, which is a bit slower.  But if one can afford it and is looking for a fast car with smooth features, the CLK 430 is the way to go.  FORGET the M3.
