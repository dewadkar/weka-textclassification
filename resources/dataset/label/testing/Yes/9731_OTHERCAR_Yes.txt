            This past spring we were going to buy my wife a new car.  Her '01 Impala was, and still is, in great shape, but we've had it for two years and thought we'd get a new family sedan.

So we went around to the different dealerships and looked at all the family sedans, making Chevrolet our last stop because we already knew the current Impala.  Nothing else impressed us too much.  

While at Chevy, I couldn't stay away from the white Monte Carlo SS they had on the floor.  Then my wife came up with the idea of me getting a new car to replace my eight year old Saturn which had started to need electronic bits (mucho $$) during the previous two months.  She'd keep her Impala for another two years.

I test drove an LS and SS back to back.  Both were nice but the SS was noticeably more competent than the LS due to the larger engine (3.8 vs. 3.4), the stiffer suspension, and the SS&#146s 4 wheel disc brakes.  Plus, the way I wanted the LS decked out (rear spoiler package), the base SS (the one I wanted) was only about $800 more than that LS.  So the SS it would be.

During February of '03 Chevy was running a &#145cash-back or 0% interest&#146 promotion if you took a car from stock.  The problem was I wanted a car the way I wanted it and if I had to compromise I wasn&#146t gonna be happy.  I wanted a silver SS, black cloth interior, a cassette deck (no CD), and that was it.  The base SS package already had cruise control and anti-lock brakes.  The problem was that most existing SS&#146s were outfitted with a long list of options &#150 lotsa money for stuff I didn&#146t want.

I got lucky and found the exact car I wanted at another local dealer.  Arrangements were made for my dealer to get the car and the rest, as they say, is history.

My dealer made me an extraordinarily good deal and showed me the paperwork to back it up.  If you&#146re in the metro NY area and want a great car buying experience, ping me and I&#146ll steer you to the right guy, as well as let you know who you may want to avoid.

The other car I was considering was the Mustang.  I wanted a base, V6 engine model.  What steered me away from the Mustang was its size.  It was too small everywhere &#150 trunk, interior &#150 and it had rear wheel drive.  We had a bad winter last year.  I don&#146t want to be messing with snow tires.  The main thing that kept me vacillating between the two cars was that the Chevrolet does not offer a manual transmission for the Monte (it has a 4-speed automatic) but you can get one in the Mustang if you want.  I wanted a manual.  But the virtues of the Monte were too great to ignore.

Also, there are a million Mustangs on the road, and not nearly as many Montes.  There is a certain, limited value I put on exclusivity.

The one problem I had with my Monte was with the door autolock system.  It was fixed by the dealer after three attempts but I still don't trust it completely.  My wife's Impala has never had even a hint of trouble with this same system.

I love my Monte Carlo SS.  It looks, accelerates, handles, stops, and just does everything the way I want it to and expect.  The interior is spacious, handsome, and I can fit a bicycle in the back with the rear seats folded down.  I can&#146t even do this in the Impala because the seats don&#146t fold down (with the rear seats up the Monte's trunk is smaller than the Impala's).  Getting on the highway or making a pass is effortless.  The engine is powerful and very smooth.  The upped SS suspension handles curves surprisingly well for such a big car.  There is very little body roll.  The seats are very comfortable and multi-adjustable.  This car just makes me feel great.  I love driving it or just looking at it.
