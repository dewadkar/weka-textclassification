            I expected alot from Mazda in their sporty little 'MX-5' Miata, and they delivered and then some. This car is MAGIC. But it is SMALL. If you are tall or large you will probably not be comfortable here. The appeal is obvious. The sassy good looks; the joy of riding with your wind in the hair and the sun or the stars streaming down on you... And the handling is everything one could ask and more. The car just follows it's nose everywhere, effortlessly tracking at 90 Mph... Gripping the road like it has claws in the hard corners. The 1.8 liter engine is willing and has a delightful snarl as you snick through the gears. (You will want to keep the RPM up.) And shifting is pure joy. The throw is short and precise. I do have to admit though, that the power is only adequate. It is plenty for me, but some might find the car to lack a little acceleration. All this is nice, but it is pretty much what we expect of a sports roadster. Surprisingly the car is very comfortable. It rides well and takes bumps quite well for a sports car. The top is very well designed and keeps you bone dry in any weather. Putting up or taking the top down is EASY. I can do either with one hand in a matter of seconds. Some people may have to put the top up from outside the car, but it is still very easy. The latches are easy to use and very secure. The glass back window with defroster is wonderful. To truly appreciate this you need to have experienced the alternative. Plastic windows that fog in the rain, and cloud and tear with age, leaving the driver to hang his head out the door to back up. Now that I have tried a glass window I would not even consider one of the many convertibles with plastic rear windows. The standard CD sound system is more than adequate. The quality of the car is superb. The ride is quiet and refined, and these cars last a long time with only normal maintenance. I have had my black 2000 for 7 months and put 20,000 hard miles on it with never a problem, and I have talked to many people who have owned them for years and never even heard of any problems or repairs. I recommend the Miata to anyone who can fit in it!<br><br>
