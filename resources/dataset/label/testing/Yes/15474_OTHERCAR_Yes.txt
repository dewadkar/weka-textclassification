            I received this camera in December of 1999 and in January of 2000 I was sending it to the Sony repair center in Detroit.  I used the camera quite a bit over the holidays, carrying it around my neck and snapping pictures of friends and family.   
By the end of the first evening there was one scratch on the viewfinder and by the end of Christmas there were 4.  
The pictures are the BEST!! You can't beat the quality and features of this camera, there is just nothing better. Having the 3.5 floppy built in is wonderful(try a camera without one and compare) however the design of the camera is lacking.  
I don't understand why there is not a cover or protective shield for the viewfinder.  The lens has a cover and is much more durable than the viewfinder. The only stable way of setting the camera down is by putting it viewfinder side down making it extremely vulnerable to scratches.  
The good news is, Sony repaired it free of charge as a &quot;one time courtesy&quot; and the repair was done in a timely manor. 
My advice is to purchase a carrying case and a cover for the viewfinder immediately. <br><br>
