            First things first, I do not recommend any Jeep for first time drivers. Why? Because they flip easily on sharp turns and corners. Other than that, I love my Jeep. It gets good mileage, I can drive it anywhere; in the mountains, the city, the country, dirt roads, paved roads, grass, mud, pretty much anything. It's a great car for people who like to drive, and even more for people who like camping. It's a great camping car for outside in nature. It's easy to drive for me and anyone else who has driven it so far. Definatly a &quot;rugged, outback&quot; vehicle. I don't know what else to say except I love my Jeep!!<br><br>
