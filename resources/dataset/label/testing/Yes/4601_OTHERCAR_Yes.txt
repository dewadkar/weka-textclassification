            The '97 Park Avenue was the first year on a new 'platform'and so the folks at GM got busy and  took off the chrome trim around the wheel wells, most of the trim off the body-belt and bumpers, and re designed the interior until it now looks like every other car on the road. 
To keep the auto reviewers from howling about the soft, Park Avenue ride, they added a 'sport suspension they call the 'touring package' (another word for harder riding) No one I know who actually owns one of these big freeway cruisers wanted a 'harder ride', but who listens to us owners?  No one who owns the re designed  97 Park Ave series asked for the door handles to be moved and hidden under the arm rests, or one of the classiest dashboards on the road trashed either, but Hey, GM said it was  time for a change!  
Still, you gotta love a car that will tell you if one of your  tires is going flat, when you really need to change the oil, open your garage door, start the coffee perk, wipers that know when its stopped raining, and a dashboard that can learn your name, move your chair, tune the radio to your favorite station and set the thermostat, all before you get in, has the lift off  of a rocket sled, and gets 30mpg!
