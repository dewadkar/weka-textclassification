            Volkswagen has outdone itself again!  Volkswagen is constantly innovating the industry.  Think about Volkswagen's that you've seen.

The Beetle.  There has never been, and never will be another car such as this one.  And the release of the newest styled Beetle epitomizes Volkswagen's creativity.

All of the Bugatti line.  If you can afford one of these, you probably don't look online for other people's opinions, because you can buy them and try them without worry.

And don't forget the Lambor.. Lamborg.. Lamborghini!  These companies are both owned by Volkswagen, and their style has obviously rubbed off on the Jetta and others.
  
<b>Innovative Features</b>

If you have ever driven a Volkswagen Jetta you know that each one has little things that someone should have thought about years ago.

<i>1. No more worrying about your fingers</i> when you need to get your hood open.  You pop the hood like normal, and when you start to lift it a little lever comes out.  When you pull it your hood opens.  Unlike others where you have to guess where to push to open it.  And if you are like me, you are wondering if you will eventually hit the fan and lose a finger.

<i>2. Fall down seats connected to the trunk.</i>  This car doesn't just have fall down seats.  It has seats that fall down and allow the trunk to expand its space.  This is such a good idea!  It makes a small car massive.  It brings luxury car size to a compact.

<i>3. Turn lights on the side.</i>  Although these are not completely unique to Volkswagen, all cars should come equipped with them.  It keeps everyone informed about where you are turning no matter where they are in comparison to you.

<i>4. Weird Keyless entry.</i> This car has the coolest keys.  They are not copiable.  There is only one.  No more searching for the key that opens the trunk and the door, or the one that starts the car.  It is also standard with keyless entry, which is always cool.

<i>5. Alarm light.</i> This isn't so innovative, but I think that it's cool that the light flashes near the door.  The door is where people will see it, not on the stinking dash!

<i>6. Those cool blue lights.</i>  This car has those sweet blue lights that do not hurt everyone's eyes.  Ahh.. relief.  There are obviously tons of reasons why German cars are selling so well in the United States.

<b>Some goofy controls.</b>

<i>1. Backwards gages.</i>  The first time I drove this car I thought I was doing 35 when I was doing 70.  This is because the gages are backwards.  The RPMs are on the left! It isn't a big deal, but it was kinda funny.  Although it wouldn't have been if I was doing 70 in a 35! Ha!

<i>Neon blue lights inside.</b> The red and bright neon blue lights inside are kinda weird for this car, but I suppose they are a refreshing change to the average green.

<b>Gas Mileage to Boot!</b>

This car gets amazing gas mileage.  It will end up saving you money in the long run to buy this car!  Especially with Gas Prices in the sky.

<b>Sweet Design!</b>

I love the way this car looks.  Mine happens to be white on the outside, and solid black inside.  I think this is the fattest thing ever.  I suppose this is just my tastes, but I love it anyway.
