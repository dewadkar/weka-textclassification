            Last Christmas I was sitting and admiring my pretty little Christmas tree when it went threw my mind how much prettier it would look with a present under it.Being single isn't always what it's cracked up to be,especially at Christmas time.If there are any gifts under the tree it's because you bought them for yourself which I usually don't.The more I thought about it the more I knew I was going shopping.Off to Wal-Mart I went and after about two hours of looking at everything in the store I made up my mind exactly what I wanted.I've wanted a digital camera for a long time and today my wish would come true.I bought the Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera and headed for home.Now I have to be honest here and till you that as soon as I got home I took everything out of the box and laid it out on the table.Then I wrapped that box up real pretty and put it under the tree,keeping the camera out to play with.Hey,how else could I take a picture of my pretty little tree with a gift under it.As I walked back in the kitchen and looked at all the things laid out on the table I thought why did I ever get divorced,what a perfect time it would be to have a man around the house.I never was too good a figuring things out but I'm learning so I knew I could do this.The contents of the box were as follows:
*Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera with wriststrap and lens cap
*4 MB Compactflash removable memory card
*CD-ROM's containing:
*Kodak Mounter Software for camera and software applications
*Twain Acquire for Windows Systems
*Photodeluxe and Pagemill Software for Windows and Macintosh Systems 
from Adobe Systems,Inc.
*Photoshop Plug-in and Picture Transfer Application for Macintosh
Systems
*Photoprinter 2.0 software for Windows and Macintosh from Arcsoft
*Serial cable for Windows System and cable adapter for Macintosh 
Systems
*Video cable
*4 AA Alkaline batteries
*Quick set up guide 
*Users guide
*Registration card

I kept thinking to myself,I can do this I know I can.To my surprise it really wasn't that hard to set up at all.The quick set up guide was great and easy to understand.I was taking pictures of my pretty little tree in no time.This camera is so easy to use that you can't help but fall in love with it.Here are a few of the things I fell in love with:

*Megapixel picture resolution:1152x864 pixels
*Flash Modes:automatic,fill,red-eye,off
*Point and shoot design
*Self-timer:10 seconds
*Tripod mount:standard
*Focusing range: 19.8 inches to Infinity
*Captures JPEG and standard Flashpix image files
*Date stamp:user selectable
*Weight:10.56 ounces (excluding batteries)

I've had a lot of fun with this camera over the past year.My dog has gotten to where she actually likes getting her picture taken.Would I recommend it to anyone else,you bet.
