                 I'm sure you are wondering why.  Believe me when I say that the Geo doesn't make you feel like a force to be reckoned with.  There is nothing so grounding as driving a &quot;lawnmower&quot; as my family called it.  ( Me pulling in the driveway:  &quot;I think I hear someone mowing the lawn, Oh, it's just you!&quot;)  This car was fun to drive.
     I bought this car used for 2800.00.  I drove it for over five years.  I think I did pretty good.  The Geo Metro is what it is: a cheap car.  Buttons popped off,  plastic parts broke,  people made fun of it while I laughed all the way to the ATM to take out the money I still had.  Most importantly to me IT ALWAYS STARTED AND RAN.  No car, however spiffy, is worth anything to me if I can't count on it.  My metro never gave me any problems outside of normal repairs but when he died, he died quickly and peacefully. (The engine cracked at 140K mi.)
     I recommend it to anyone who likes their money more than their image.  Don't think I need to mention the EXCELLENT gas mileage.  I would actually forget to check the guage for weeks at a time!  Splendid car!<br><br>
