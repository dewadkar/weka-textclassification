            My first digital camera was a Canon PowerShot S20. When I bought it in 2000 it was remarkable compact 3MP (megapixel) camera. And, even by today's standards its still a great camera.

In fact, I was very happy with it until I bought my mother a PowerShot S40. After setting it up for her I became very jealous, not because it had one more MP, but because it was so much easier to use, and allowed for much more control over the aperture and shutter speed. Even downloading to a computer was easier. But, in the end, I couldn't justify a $200 upgrade when I was perfectly happy with my S20.

Then two things happened: the S50 with 5MP was announced and Dell had a great sale on digital camera to the effect that I could get the S50 for $475. I couldn't pass that deal up, and I now have the S50 in hand.

Operationally, this camera is essentially the same as the S40 and S45. It has the same optical zoom at 3x, and a slightly bigger digital zoom (but who cares about that gimmicky feature anyway.) It also allows for a longer MPEG movie, up to 3 minutes now. Again, this is a feature you probably won't use too much, though its handy for those spontaneous moments. Last, its compatible with 2GB cards, which isn't that big of a deal now, since they are expensive, but it might matter as the price of these cards fall.

Photographically, the camera takes amazing pictures, as you would expect with a Canon lens. The S50 takes pictures at the equivalent of 1MP, 2MP, 3MP, and 5MP. There is no 4MP resolution. This is no really a problem for me, as I usually shoot at 3MP resolutions, which are big enough for a great 4x5, or good 8x10. Any photo editing software package will let you trim your 5MP picture down to any size you want, should you need a 4MP resolution for some specific reason.

Some people say the added MP in the S50 without making the CCD bigger will cause "noise," or grain. I have not noticed this as of yet. I have also read reports of pictures being bluish. Again, this isn't anything I can detect on my pictures. 

Inside the PowerShot S50 box you'll find the S50 and

    * 32MB CompactFlash card
    * NB-2L Li-ion rechargeable battery
    * Battery charger
    * Wrist strap
    * USB cable
    * A/V cable
    * CD-ROM featuring various software and drivers for both
      Mac and Windows. (I use Mac OS, and don't use any of 
      the included software. I just plug in my camera and
      iPhoto downloads my pics).
    * Camera and software manuals

At the outset you'll find the 32MB card way too small. Prepare to buy a bigger card at least 256MB in size. Also stick with the faster cards 16x or faster from Lexar, SimpleTech, etc.

You'll also want another battery. Canon batteries can be expensive, but I picked up a generic battery on eBay for less than $20 shipped. The battery lasts for about 100 pictures with the LCD on.

The S50 comes in two colors: silver and black. The silver camera is meant for sale outside the U.S., and does NOT include a U.S. warranty. You may find some dealers selling this model on-line at a big discount. Be aware its a gray market model, and that you are buying at your own risk. The black model is the US model. It comes will a full U.S. warranty.

The S50 is a great camera, but its not for everyone. If all you want a digital camera for is to email pics, or make 4x5s , the S50 isn't for you. The S30 will suit you perfectly. The main advantage of having a 5MP camera is so you can make very large prints (11 x 14 and bigger). If you won't be doing this much, then you might want to look at less expensive cameras. Indeed, the main reason I bought the S50 was that I was able to get it for just a few dollars more than the S45. Had it not been for that, I would have been very happy with the S45.
