            I purchased a 2002 Buick Rendevous in March of 2002 and have now owned the Buick Rendevous for a little over a year so I feel I am qualified to write an accurate review on this vehicle. In my view, Buick has created a winner with their 2002 Buick Rendevous CX.

<b>Overall Appearance:</b> From the front of the vehicle it looks like a SUV with the classic Buick Grill. As your eyes move along the side of the vehicle you see something new, it's a cross between an SUV,mini-van and a sedan. The back of the vehicle looks more like a mini-van, but that's where the comparisons end.

<b>Overall Ride:</b> It's a great riding vehicle! Built to handle like a SUV, but it rides like a sedan! It's one of the better riding and handling vehicles I have owned. The field of view from the front windshields to the sides is extraordinary. Rendezvous Versatrak all-wheel-drive system (optional on the CX and standard on the CXL) is lightweight, efficient, and especially effective in low-traction situations. Buick Rendezvous uses front wheel drive for ordinary driving situations and automatically adds rear wheel drive capability as needed to help keep the vehicle in control and moving forward in spite of muddy, snowy, or slippery road surfaces.

Interior: The interior is very roomy. With stereo controls on the steering wheels and a large center storage area that is easily large enough to store a purse or a laptop computer! 

Problems: I have had two minor problems with the Rendevous. The first one is the starter. It does not start up on the first turn of the key 100% of the time, I would say closer to 90% of the time. I have had it in the shop two times and they have not been able to find the problem. The other was on my first oil change, the oil change place noticed the Transmission fluid was leaking. This was easily fixed. ALso the key fab has broken a couple of times but these were all covered under warranty.
