            I have owned and driven a 1997 Geo Metro for many years. I should mention that I should be considered a subject matter expert on this car since my commute at times has been an hour and a half EACH WAY. My Geo and I have spent a considerable amount of time together to say the least. 

My first impression of this car, like most peoples, were that it was WAY to small and would have no leg room, no power, and by turning on the A/C, I would not be able to make it up hills. That being said, this car has become to date, the most reliable car I have owned and has earned it's small price over and over.

The interior is spacious in the front seats with plenty of room for legs and heads. The rear seats are actually comfortable as well with a reasonable amount of leg room even with the front seat pushed to the rear. The 4cylinder engine is a necessity to say the least, but it performs admirably getting me between 37-45 MPG. The car is reasonably quiet and a conversation can be carried on while driving at highway speeds. Handling is stiff but acceptable. 

On the negative side, I take serious issue with the size of the fuel tank. While it is great to pay only 6-7 dollars for a fill up, I would much rather get more than 225 miles on a tank. To compare, my new Dodge Caravan goes up to 500 miles on a tank of gas. When making longer commutes I was having to fill up the Geo's tank daily. This being said, it is not like it was expensive to fill up, just annoying. My second issue with this car is understandable but still annoying. There have been many other reviews touching on this and it should go without saying, but put 3 or four people in this car and there is no room for ANY luggage. Do not expect to be taking a trip in this car if there are more than two of you. You also need to watch the weight restrictions as three "big" guys could max out the cars listed weight limits.

Overall this car makes up for what should be obvious size issues by providing a reliable commuter car that will go the distance.
