            I have been driving the Aurora since June 1994, bought the first one at the dealer.

The older style [95-99] is a fantastic car.  It well defines the term luxury sports sedan.  You get the same features as a Lincoln, Lexus, or Infinity for much less money.

Looked at the new model [2001] and realized that the new one does not have the curb appeal of the older model so am going to buy a new 1999 if I can find the right one to replace my 1997.

I put in a lot of miles per year [2000] mixed between LA rush hour and open freeway driving.  I generally run at 22 mpg which is very good for this heavy a car with a big engine.

While the car handles like a sports car, it has the room of a very large sedan.  The back seat has more then adequate knee room and it also has A/C vents in back.  The middle of the back seat has a pull down arm rest that also lets you put long objects in the trunk.  I often bring home 2 x4's home from Home Depot with the trunk closed.  The trunk itself has as much room as a Lincoln Continental.  

The engine is so quiet that Olds had to put in a cutout switch to keep you from trying to start the engine while it was already running.  

The aerodynamic form and its long wheel base makes it very stable on the road, even in strong cross winds.  I am often driving in Riverside county on a freeway that gets featured with overturned trucks on the news because of the bad cross winds.  I barely feel the wind, even at 70 mph.<br><br>
