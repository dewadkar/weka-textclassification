            I've had my MX-1200 nearly 2 years. When I bought it I had read all the reviews about poor pictures, battery life measured in minutes, and the world of experts was starting to say that 2 megapixels was probably not enough even for casual photography.

But, I saw a couple sample pictures, knew rechargable batteries had been invented, and most of all was short on cash. Besides my main use was for my web site and ebay sales and for that, 1.3 megapixels is too much, not too little.

I bought mine in June 2000 at an online closeout specialist that's since out of business for $180. 

Fast forward to 2002. I've literally taken thousands of pictures. It's so much in demand in my household that we've got a signup sheet on the refrigerator!

I like to peer through the optical viewfinder and leave the LCD display off, so the batteries seem to last a long time. Downloading is slow, so remember to turn off the display while you do it, then the batteries will last longer. But I invested $20 in a SmartMedia card reader for my computer and now pictures download in a flash.

Mainly though, what keeps it out of the back of my sock drawer is the picture quality. It's really good. At work we recently got a $999 Nxxxx 5 Megapixel camera, five! One morning we got all the employees together outside for a group shot. We took pictures with the 5 MP camera, a $500 3 megapixed camera, and I got in a couple shots with my faithful MX-1200. Guess which picture got printed and posted to the web site -- that's right -- the Fuji.

About resolution: 1.3 megapixels is a bit larger than full screen resolution on most 17 inch monitors. On photo quality paper, 4x6 inch prints are indistinguishable from "real" prints, and full sheet 8 1/2 x 11 inch prints are at least magazine quality.

It's got 5 flash modes, manual exposure compensation, good automatic color balance with several manual settings when needed. One cute feature is when you're low on memory, you can convert selected pictures to lower resolution to gain space. Not a problem for me because I use a 32 MB card now. That's 80 high resolution or 350 low.

It comes with the usual Adobe Photo Shop, a twain driver, a bizarre program called Picture Shuttle, and a very crude picture editor EZ Touch. Life's too short, get a SmartMedia reader and Paint Shop Pro, and don't bother with the CD that comes packed with the camera. If you don't buy a reader, then use the twain driver. Picture Shuttle still makes no sense.

Oh, yes. Get a set of NiMh rechargable AA batteries, and hide the camera from your family.
