            The Jeep Cherokee is priced right and retains it's value. It is durable and comfortable together, providing lots of value for your money. Driving the Jeep is like moving in a dream - it is such a smooth ride and does not feel like a truck. This sport utility vehicle offers luxury along with a good value - pack up your family, pack up your animals, and off you go. The only thing I hate about my jeep is that under the hood everything is so compact, which makes it difficult to work on at home, necessitating a trip to the dealer. This is a great sports utility vehicle for a growing family and pet owner alike. Try it I guarantee you will love it!<br><br>
