            We own a 1998 Hummer Wagon - tricked out with almost everything you can get.  We've had a great time driving it.  We find that it's very mobile, and surprisingly comfortable - and does fit in parking spaces.  It does have the driving characteristics of a truck - slow acceleration and braking, although it does hug corners surprisingly well.  However, we have also found that the maintenance on the rig is rather extreme.  
Ours has only 13,000 miles on it and has had two entire new sets of brakes (at $800 each) because the brake pads were &quot;soft&quot; - they've &quot;redesigned&quot; the brake pads to last longer, so they may last a reasonable number of miles this time. AM General did not make concessions on the brakes even though they wore out in an unreasonably short time.  Our Hummer has now had *both* the engine and transmission replaced in warranty.  It has spent about 20 days of the last 10 months in the shop either being fixed or diagnosed.  While I love the car, I dread the day we run out of the warranty.  It's a great car if mobility is more important to you than reliability, but I wouldn't recommend it as your only car.<br><br>
