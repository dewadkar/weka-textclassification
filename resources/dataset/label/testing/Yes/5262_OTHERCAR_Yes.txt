            I bought the Millenia S a year ago.  It was three years old but it feels BRAND NEW!  The quality that was put in this car is unbeatable!  I am a very busy individual and have been very hard on this car, but it still feels and drives like brand new! 

It comes with power leather seats, moonroof, BOSE stereo system, power tilt steering and temperature control, just to name a few!  It also has a really BIG trunk, a compartment in the back seat between the speakers, a storage compartment under the arm rest and an average size glove box for lots of storage.   

This car drives like a sports car but still has 4 doors and a spacious interior.  The get-up-and-go of this car has surprised many people while on the road!  If you love the way a sports car handles but a need a family car, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!

The only complaints I have about this car is the expensive maintenance, having to use Premium gas every time I fill up (for the turbo engine), and the flimsy drink holder.  The drink holder is a pop-out under the stereo and it is very flimsy.  They definitely could have done something to make this a little better.

Overall, this is an AWESOME car and the expensive maintenance is worth the quality!  I have had the car a little over a year and am still ecstatic with it which is very unusual for me.  I am usually ready to trade a car in because I get tired of it every 6 months.  I would recommend this car to anyone!
