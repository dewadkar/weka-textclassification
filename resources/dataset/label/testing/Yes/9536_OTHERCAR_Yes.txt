              I love this this car. When I went looking for a new car I was  looking for a bigger car. I saw this car on the lot and knew it was mine.
  I had driven a lot of cars and looked around for sometime before deciding on this car.( I only looked at GM cars, in my humble opinion they are the only cars; period.) 
  I had driven Cadillacs for twenty years ; but I was about ready to retire so I could not justify sending that kind of money on a car when my income was going to be lowered so greatly.
  Looks are what really made me to decide to test drive the Monte Carlo. I was really impressed with the speed and handling of the car. What really surprised me was how comfortable the car was and how good of a ride it gave.
  After owning the car for a little while I became impressed with how economical it was to operate.I have owned this car for three years and I would buy another.
  This would not be a car for people who haul around a number of people . Large people are fine in the front seats of the car but not the back seat.(I am 6'2&quot; and 270 pounds) I am very comfortable and have no problems getting in or out of the car.
  I give this car a two thumbs up.I have been driving for 35 years and have never received more complement on a car.
