            I bought my 1996 Acura Integra GSR largely because I needed a reliable, fun to drive, and somewhat practical car. I drive about 60 miles per day, and after searching for the perfect car, I think I found it.
Things that I love about this car: it has a dual personality; from 1000-5000 rpms, it behaves much like a honda civic with a little more punch. From 5000-8100 (redline), it absolutely screams! This is great for someone like me who likes to drive a car passionately (read: hard), because most of the power in this car comes from the high end of the rpm band. 
There are very few things I do not like about this car. However, the fact that there are so many on the road is a little annoying. I see 5-10 Integras per day, and maybe 2-3 of those are GSRs. The design, although sporty, has been around since 1994, which is ancient for a design from Honda. That's about it, however.
I absolutely love driving this car. It handles nicely, and if you keep the rpms up, it can keep up with just about anything in the turns. In addition, I have been able to get between 25-30+ mpg, and I tend to drive my car hard.
I think a person who is looking for a sporty but still practical car should by an Integra GSR. However, those who want a supple ride and a quiet engine should look elsewhere.
