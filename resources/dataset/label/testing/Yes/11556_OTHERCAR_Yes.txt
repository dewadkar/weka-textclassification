            If youï¿½re in the market for a SUV don't pass another Jeep dealer without stopping in. Jeeps are not for everyone but you'll never know until you try it. I bought my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport in March 1999. Since that time I have put 36,000 fun filled miles on the Jeep. I have driven it from Portland OR, through Chicago, IL and on to Ft Walton Beach, FL. For 2000 of those miles I was towing my other Jeep, a 1985 CJ7. The only work done to the Jeep so far is regular oil changes, new transmission oil cooler and a class III hitch (for towing), and a new windshield (road debris). I admit it's not a luxury ride, but for an entry level SUV at the price you can't go wrong. Look at the history of Jeep and the resale value, you'll be convinced. It has its share of road-noise, larger than usual gaps on the body, strange noises now and then, but what car doesn't. If you want a SUV that will never leave the pavement and rides like a caddy - DON'T buy a Cherokee. If you want cheap, rugged, dependable, off-road assurance and a great daily driver - look no further. ANY Jeep you buy should be a lifetime companion: Jeeps are readily available and always will be, you'll never have trouble finding parts, and it will take you anywhere you want to go. There's Only One - Jeep!  <br><br>
