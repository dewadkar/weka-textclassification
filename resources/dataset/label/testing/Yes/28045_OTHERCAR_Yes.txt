              Every car I have driven has been a Plymouth, so when I bought this brand new Plymouth Neon 2000 I was expecting a top of the line vehicle. After having the car a little over a month, the reality of my purchase kicked in. As a 5'10 male, i require a good amount of space for my legs to reach the peddles. Even with my seat all the way back, my legs still cramp. This car was not designed for anyone over 5 feet tall!!!
  Although the car is relatively uncomfortable, it does have that &quot;futuristic&quot; look. The sleek body and low center of gravity help to corner well and give a good look on the road. If I were to recommend that anyone buy this heap of metal, make sure that you have a cd player installed. The sound system will make your hair follicles vibrate. Your fingernails will be tingling after listing. Hey, that might be the only good thing about this car, but it gets me to where I need to go and it is has never had to go to the shop once.
  Another annoying aspect about the car is the incessant humming of the miniature 4 cylinder engine. It is enough to drive anyone crazy. If you want to get on the highway, don't look to speed right into the HOV lane, you will get rear ended.  <br><br>
