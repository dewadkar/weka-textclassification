            I just rented a 2001 Ford Taurus LX for five days.   The car came with standard options such as dual air bags, A/C, anti-theft alarm and cup holders.  This was my first Ford experience in the past ten years.  The last Ford I drove was a 1984 Ford Tempo in early 90ï¿½s, which I wrecked in an accident.  Also, I had to spend at least a few hundred dollars for a repair bill.  So, it was a great chance for me to try out their improvements over the past 15 years.  

The first thing I realized was the alarm system, which reminded me to wear my seat belt every few minutes. For a driver who does not wear a seat belt all the time, this is a must-have feature for your vehicle.  In fact, the repeated alarm finally made me wear the seat belt.  Another neat thing about this car was its acceleration.   I could not believe that this car only has 153-horse power with a 3.0 litter engine (V6).  The acceleration reminded me of a Camaro or other fast sports cars.   Also, the look of this car has improved a lot from its previous model.  I definitely prefer this model over the previous model.  

For a sports car lover like myself, the back seat space seemed so large.  I am sure that there is no problem to seat two or three adults in the back seats.  It is also fair to say the front seats are very comfortable.  Also, the large windows of the car minimize the existence of blind spots.  

The only drawback of the car I noticed was that it ran about 25 miles per gallon based on my calculation, which is maybe a littler lower than the average sedan in its class.   Overall, I am very satisfied with the car and it totally changed my opinion about Ford.
