            My first car was/is a Toyota Paseo, these cars are dependable, reliable, and look great.  This is a perfect car for the new driver. Even though i have had my car for almost 6 years i have yet to have any real problems with it.  It handles well, is dependable, gas is not expensive and looks nice too.  In the next year i am planning on getting a  new car but my Paseo has continually come through for me. Even after all these years she is as good as new!  The new Paseo convertible promises to be even better than the older Paseos but either way Toyota's especially Paseos are great fun cars. <br><br>
