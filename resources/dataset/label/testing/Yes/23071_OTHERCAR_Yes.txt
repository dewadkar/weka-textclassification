            When we bought this camera we didn't know anything about digital cameras so we didn't want to sink a lot of money onto it.  now that I know a little more Im still very pleased with it.  We paid $200.00  for it has served us well.  its a nice beginers camera.  I do however find that sometimes when I press the button to take a pic nothing will happen, so i have to keep pressing and it always eventually takes the pic. This camera also is a great online auction tool.  And the program that comes with it is really neat and it has some fun options.  Like you can place your face on a character on your choice(for instance a football player).Lots of fun.<br><br>
