            My husband bought me this camera for my birthday last October. I have used it almost everyday since. There are now hundreds of pictures on our family web site for friends and family that do not live close by to see the goings on around here.

I have not had any problems with his camera at all since we got it.

<b>Easy of use</b>
To turn it on, there is a small button towards the top of the camera, on the back, where the view screen is. Once on, you then press the &#145select&#146 button to view what you&#146re looking at. The view screen is not very large, but if you&#146re using it to take pictures of your family, as a hobby, it is all you really need.

Once you take a picture, it is displayed on the view screen for about 10 seconds, before it is stored and your view screen returns to the image you are pointing it at. During that time that the picture you just took is on the screen, you can choose to delete it if you want. You can always go back and look at the pictures later and delete any from there if you want to.

On the bottom right of the back, not far from where the view screen is, there is a switch, where you have three options. One is picture taking mode, the second is picture viewing mode, where you can see all the pictures you&#146ve taken, and the last option is the details, where you set the date and time and image quality.

<b>A note about image quality</b>
The image quality setting is you choice, and I find that it really depends on what you&#146ll be doing with the pictures. If you want to put them on a web site and email them to your friends and family, the second setting is the best bet. That way, you can fit 82 pictures on the camera without a memory card. I have also found that with a good digital editing program, high quality paper and a good printer, you can also print off pictures at this setting without losing quality. 

However, if you&#146ve bought this camera, solely for the purpose of taking pictures and printing them out, you may want to get a memory card, and leave the image quality set to best.

<b>Durability</b>
I am rough on my camera. I try not to be, but it has fallen down the stairs, I have taken pictures with it in the rain, the dog has drooled all over it and it has survived with hardly a scratch.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is interested in taking digital pictures of friends and family. Mine came with a strap, a lens cap and a digital editing program. The program it came with is hardly ever used, but it is decent.
