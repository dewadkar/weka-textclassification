            In the Fall, I purchased the new Jag S-Type and could hardly wait for winter to be over and spring to begin so that I could really enjoy my new Cat.  Given that this is my third Jag in 15 years, it both builds on the tradition of fine English craftsmanship and style with the puff-fect blending of technology, performance and dependability.  It's a dream to drive and it surrounds you in class.  It's youthful yet refined.  While it certainly draws the looks, it's not vulgar in the statement it makes. Only three minor irritants are that the outside temperature indicator does not stay on continuously, that it doesn't come with a multi-disc CD player that you can stick in the trunk instead of the glove compartment, and that the speaker grill on the door happens to be located where my kneecap rests and as a result, I feel the vibration when pulsating music is on.  Otherwise, this is a car for people who demand performance yet like pampering themselves without bankrupting the bank.  In this election year, it has my vote! <br><br>
