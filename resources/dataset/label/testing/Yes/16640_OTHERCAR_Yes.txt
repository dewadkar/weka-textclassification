            )6 Month Update Below Original Opinion)

OK, you can do a search on the Tiburon and find the same old thing over and over about the 140 HP engine and the "too-high" trunk lip and the small backseat. I'd like to give a little bit more; the kinds of things you need to know.

First, I just traded in my '86 Taurus for a 2001 Tiburon. I had the Taurus for a year and I usually buy 4-door cars, preferring to get my zip from my motorcycle. But I rented a 2000 Tiburon a month ago and liked it so much I bought one two days ago. Here's what I got:

  2001 Tiburon
  5 speed manual transmission
  Leather interior
  Sunroof
  Cruise control
  CD stereo

Let me start by saying that I really like this car. Overall I like just about everything about it. Most of the negative comments that follow here are minor issues and don't detract enough from the car to hurt it.
  
I like manual transmissions, and this one has a good feel to it. First gear is a little hard to hit in a hurry and seems to catch a little as you downshift, but it's not bad enough to make you regret getting it. The transmission has a smooth feel and plenty of pep. I like the fact that there are no tricks to putting it in reverse, like pushing down and out. It's well placed for comfortable shifting. 

The leather interior is OK but I wouldn't bother to pay for it. I got it because this one was the only model on the lot with a manual transmission and a sunroof. I don't think you need a leather interior on a $16,000 car unless you just like to tell people your car has a leather interior. 

The sunroof on this car is just an opaque cover that retracts. I was surprised that, unlike the Sonata, I couldn't get one with a window. I'm still not sure if this is because that's all they had on the lot, or if they don't offer it on the Tiburon. I opened it (in the winter in Michigan) and liked the amount of air coming in as well as the lack of noise produced at 50MPH. It helped with the closed-in feeling I was getting, being used to my more spacious Taurus. 

The seats are comfortable, but I'm 5'8" and 160#. I can see that for a large person this car may not fit. The visor felt a bit too close at first, but after adjusting the angle of the seat it's gotten better. Getting to the back seat is a pain. If you lift the seat back you lose your settings. Then getting in and sitting down is a little cramped until you reset the seat.

Once you're seated and have everything adjusted it's quite comfortable. I feel like I could sit there for hours on a long trip and really enjoy it. 

The ride is great. I don't feel like I'm outclassed on the road, though I would think twice before racing someone. The low end (for the manual) is a little slow but you get great response at the high-end without having to redline it. The car also seems to break well. The steering isn't too soft and is responsive. I have good visibility out my windows and mirrors, and can read the dash easily.

There's snow on the ground here in Michigan. I don't like the way the Tiburon handles in the snow. I admit I'm used to the heavier Taurus, but I slip a lot more in this thing when starting from a dead stop and while taking even slow turns on roads with more than a little snow. It's much worse than the Taurus was. Not a good winter car.

The cargo area seems smaller than it looks. As I threw stuff back there from my old car it filled up quickly. The backseat doesn't seem to offer much more room. But again, I'm coming from a full sized car. Still, I think I've had more room in a Neon.

The colors I saw were unimpressive. I bought a black one, and even though I think it's the sharpest color they offer, I hate black cars in the summer. The silver and the red looked cheap, like what you'd expect from the old Hyundais. The yellow was too muted, but not that bad. A brighter yellow would have been really sharp. The blue was a nice deep color, but didn't really bring out the lines of the car. Those were all I saw. The black color is nice and shiny, giving the car a more expensive look. With the sunroof's ability to push up in the back, summers may be doable.

All and all, I love this car. I love how it feels, I love the way it drives (off the snow), I love the way it looks. I have no regrets (yet) about the car and I would highly recommend it.

This is not your grandma's Hyundai

6 Month (12,000 mile) Update:

It's been just over six months and 12,000 miles and I still love this car. It's hot with the under 30 crowd and I get a lot of "wow, nice car" comments. But there have been a couple of problems that have cropped up. 

1)  Noise. It's not a quiet car. It's not as bad as a convertible would be but you can hear the road noise. There are two vibrations, one from the rear-view mirror and one from under the dash. I assume Hyundai will take care those when I bring it in.

2)  CD Player. For two days it wouldn't read a CD. It works fine now. The volume control is totally messed up. Sometimes (most times) the volume goes up when you're trying to turn in down, or vice versa. 

3)  Cheap Paint Job. Fine lines and scratches EVERYWHERE! I plan to get it re-painted, and NOT by Hyundia. It's the worst paint job I've had on a car. It's the one thing I really dislike about it.

I still love to drive it. I still recommend it, but talk to the dealer about paint options some sort of protection beyond the clear coat.

To be fair, I haven't taken the car in to have them look at the paint or any of these other issues. I plan to do that soon, but my local dealer won't give me a rental while they have it and I can't be without my car. 

I'v driven the car across the country and just loved it! A week and 4000 miles and I was happy the whole time. I've rarely had a car this good on such a long trip. The seats are well designed and very comfortable.
