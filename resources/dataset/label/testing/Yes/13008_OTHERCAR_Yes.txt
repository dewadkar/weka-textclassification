            <b>Intro</b>
After getting stood up to go see Finding Nemo, I did what any guy would do to get his mind off it... I went digital camera shopping.

I went to possibly the worse place to go camera shopping in hopes of blowing two hundred dollars on a toy that would make me temporarily happy; I went to Fry's.

Fry&#146s had a whole slew of digital cameras that I could pick up, feel and man handle to see what would best "suit" me.

I looked at the array of Olympus cameras, HP cameras, cannon, Sony, and all the other 3rd party ones.

<b> what I found</b>
I found the Canon A60 Digital camera for three hundred dollars.  Granted this was a little bit over budget, it was definitely the best deal for my dollar. (Price is now down to $185 online.)

<b>Features</b>
The features on this camera are much better than a lot of other ones.
<b>PROS</b>
1. <b>Glass lens</b> Lots of the digital cameras are made with hard plastic lenses, but for the better quality, always go for the glass lenses.

2. <b>2.0 Mega pixels</b> (for higher resolution quality pictures.  There is a 5.0 Mega pixel camera which is about film quality, but if you don't need it, 2.0 are good enough.

3. <b>Optical zoom and Digital zoom. </b> (Optical is 3.0x digital is 2.5x when you combine the two you get 7.5x zoom) Most digital cameras only have the digital zoom so the quality is much worse when you zoom in digitally.  With optical zoom the lens moves so you don't lose any of the quality.

4. <b>Movie mode</b>- This is one of the coolest features. I found movie mode on accident just fooling around with the camera.  There's actually a big picture of a movie camera on the picture options on the top of the camera.  The movie mode comes with sound, so you can actually hear what you've recorded.  There&#146s a chord you can use to plug your camera straight into your television and view the footage, as if the camera were a camcorder.  The Movie Mode does not shut off after any certain amount of time.  The movie mode will stop <i>when you run out of memory</i> or when you manually stop it.  This is a feature that is well liked, since most similarly priced models stop only after a minute of recording.

5. <b>Battery Power</b> Very important!! This camera uses four double A batteries, that&#146s 4 AA batteries.  I love this feature, because the lithium batteries most cameras use is extremely expensive.  However, it does add a little bulk to the camera, but I think it's well hidden because it's in the handle of the camera.  This also makes the weight of the camera a little heavier than other ones.

6. <b>5 point AiAF</b> The 5 point auto focus feature kicks in when you slightly hold the button down to take the picture.  It auto focuses (and has been 100% accurate every time) and shows you where it's focusing on in the picture.  Sometimes it focuses on 1 point and sometimes 5 and anywhere in between.

7. <b>Memory</b> The Camera comes with 16 MB of compact flash, which would give you about 20 hi resolution pictures.  However the cool thing about this compact flash is it's cheap.  It's very very cheap compared to the other types of flash memory.  I bought 128MB CF from fry's for 35 dollars.  The same amount cost over 50 dollars for other cameras.  I just recently saw 256 MB of CF at Fry's for 45 dollars.  That would grant you about 300 hi resolution pictures without having to download them onto your computer!  CF is rewriteable, so you don't have to purchase any more just download them to your computer and then erase them from your flash memory.

8. <b>Panoramic mode</b> when you take the first shot it will display that first shot and line it up with the next shot and so on till you complete your panoramic shot.  It's a cool feature, but I rarely use it.

9. <b>Durability</b> I've had this camera for about 4 months now and I haven't had any problems with things breaking.  I've never dropped it, and I keep it in a case, so I'm not sure if it's just because I take care of it.

<b>CONS</b>

1. <b>the weight</b> the weight of this camera is much heavier than the weight of many of the other smaller elf cameras.

2. <b>Flash</b> the flash feature seems to mess up pictures more than help it.

3. <b>LCD</b> although the Liquid crystal display on the camera is bright, it doesn't properly display pictures. It tends to show pictures brighter than they actually are.  The display is a TFT display, however it is very difficult to see during the daytime and you have to cover it with your hand to see it better.

4. <b>No timer mode</b> There's no way to set a timer and have it take a picture on its own.  I have searched the features of the camera, but have not been able to find it.  It could be user error and my fault completely, but I just can't find a timer on it.

5. <b>Learning curve</b> this camera has a little bit of a learning curve, it's mostly intermediate.  The problem with this is that if you want someone else to take a picture of you for you, it's difficult to explain how to take the picture.

6. <b>Speed</b> There's a speed feature which allows you to take pictures faster, however, I've always had a slight delay taking the picture and missing what I actually wanted to get because the camera can be slow. There's about an 8th of a second delay from pushing the button to it actually taking the picture.

<b>PRICE</b>
When comparing prices, you'll find that the Cannon A60 is worth the price tag of 185 dollars.  You can also purchase the A70, but the only difference is you get 3.0 Mega pixels and the digital zoom is 3.2x combined to be 10x, which in my opinion is not worth paying the extra money for the A70.  Definitely the Canon A60 will get you the most bang for your buck.
