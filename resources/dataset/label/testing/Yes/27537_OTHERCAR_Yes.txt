            This is a very good car! We have had it for about three years now and we love it. It has great 4 wheel drive and handles great. It is also a great family car to. if You are lookin for a good sports car to this is also good. it is also good for a long commute into boston or a nother big big city. But that doesnt mean that it cant go on back roads, it can. It also goes very good on the bad weather conditins, feel alot safer in this car than you do in another one. So my edvise to you whod be to by this car!!!!!! Its also comfortable.<br><br>
