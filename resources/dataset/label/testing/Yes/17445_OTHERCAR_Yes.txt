            I bought a 1997 Prelude just a few weeks ago, with the automatic + sequential sportshift transmission. For the time being, I think this car has excellent sports car capabilities, in which any Honda hardcore fan will surely love.

2.2l DOHC VTEC engine
210+ horses, 175lb-ft torque
7.2s launch from 0-60mph
17 inch rims

Engine mods
------------

Ceramic coated header
Ignition System

Engine:

If you've driven any VTEC-powered Honda car before (like a Civic, and older Prelude, or an Accord), you will surely feel something different about this car, besides its huge power compared to what smaller Hondas offer. The engine sound is deep and throaty (even with the stock exhaust), and is greatly enhanced if you are able to replace the air intake system. The VTEC zone starts at 5,500rpm. At that point, the tach needle and engine sound change completely. A very aggresive engine sound, along with a faster engine rev-up. Extremely fun, and all drivers in cars around you will surely feel intimidated by the engine's powerful growl! Very intimidating sound, when you slam the gas and reach the VTEC zone in the tach... The redline comes it at about 7,500rpm; the Honda Civic has it at 8,000rpm, because it is a smaller (1.6liter) engine.

Driving with the sequential transmission is very easy and fun, even when crusing at low speeds on the street. 

Engaging the sequential mode is made by pushing lightly the shift lever to its own parallel gate, to the left of the "D4" (drive) slot. Upshifts and downshifts come in as easy as a push forward, or downward in the shift knob. Gear change is immediate (I'd like it to be a little faster, though). The computer will not let you downshift from a higher gear if you will pull over the redline while in the lower gear, however, it will remember your decision and will downshift as soon as engine rpm's come to a safe speed, so that the engine will not crack up.

A red LED display (from 1 to 4) located in the middle of the tachometer will show you the gear in which you're currently in, while driving in sequential sportshift mode.

Take note that while driving in sequential mode, it is not completely manual. If you're in 4th gear for example, and come to a complete stop, then the computer will automatically downshift to 1st gear, as to protect the engine from stalling.

Flick the lever from the sportshift gate back to the right, the red LED shift gear display will turn off, and the computer will switch to fully automatic mode. This can be done anytime, while driving at high speeds or while at a complete stop.

With this Prelude, you should be able to smoke any (unmodified) Honda Civic Sis, Honda Accords, and earlier Preludes.

Ride:

Ride is firm (as I have 17inch rims in it), but the stock Prelude comes with 205/40-16 wheels. Good suspension (much better than my older Civic's). Seats have good lateral support (both lumbar, and the sides of the legs), although the back seems very thin, and you can actually feel the seat's interior structure (springs) when the seats grow old.
Back seats are cramped (typical of a sports car, though!), and only small to medium sized adults or children will tolerate long trips in them.

Quality:

Good Honda reliability and craftsmanship. However, slam close the doors and you will hear a hollow, thin, tinny sound, not a solid clam-shut-tight sound typical of european cars. Door panels feel a bit weak while grabbing the door handle and closing the door. However, door materials and interior plastics are of good quality. A simulated wood trim covers the center dash and the side doors (you've got the option of a carbon-fibre look or simulated wood trim as choices).

Styling:

Good news is that a 1997,'98,'99, and '00 models look exactly as the last 2001 model (Honda will discontinue the Prelude in 2002, as it has been replaced by the S2000. The only thing I have noticed is the four-spoke steering wheel inside the '98+ Preludes. The '97 model has three spokes.

Looks great from behind (nice taillights and butt, great job, Honda!), and from the front, it has an aggressive, wedge-shaped stance (bluging front fenders, and low profile appeareance).

From the side, 17+ sized wheels will greatly enhance your Prelude's appeareance.
