            The first thing you notice about the Legend is it's stance. It is low-slung and aggressive - it's sleek, linear form is instantly recognizable amid the jungle of rounded bubbles that passes for automotive design today.

If the Acura Legend's exterior is pleasing to the eye, then it's interior is equally impressive. There are the usual accoutrements - leather, a non-cluttered dash with simple-to-use controls for everything including the AC (don't underestimate the value of simplicity of on-dash controls!). More impressive are the controls on the steering wheel, allowing you to operate the radio, and cruise control. This way, your eyes are always on the road, and you don't have to look down for anything. One note on the cruise control operations - there are the usual three buttons (cancel, accelerate/decelerate). But I think the best implementation of such a system I've seen to date has been on the '98 Toyota Camry, which uses a lever much like your turn-signal lever, to accomplish the task. Works like a dream. The Legend's button-driven system works fine, but is unremarkable.

The performance of this V6 sedan is, well, Good. Quick acceleration, very sure handling, perhaps best exhibited in the fact that the car has minimal roll on cornering (due to it's low-slung design). Point the nose where you want to go, and in less time than it takes to read this, you'll be exactly there. In my mind, that's the most important aspect of a car. Poor handling negates almost any other attributes of an automobile. You can definitely feel the Legend's transmission as it goes through the lower gears - not as smooth as today's luxury sedans, but then again I actually like the feeling of power. Nothing is masked. The Legend does understeer into turns, which is to be expected from a front-wheel drive vehicle. Braking is solid, via the ABS. Gas efficiency isn't all that great - I go about about 300 miles on a tank, so I get somewhere just under 20mpg. Since gas in California is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced, this gas mileage hurts. But compared to your average SUV which gets more gallons to the mile than vice versa, it isn't all that bad.

Rear legroom is ok, not great. If your friends are much over 6 feet, or have very long legs, you might introduce them to public transportation. Or perhaps to the Legend's capacious trunk. Speaking of the trunk, there's a nice spare-wheel well, which unfortunately contains a donut.

I bought this car used, and according to the seller it is one of the most demanded used cars around. This is probably due to two things: Acura/Honda's &quot;legendary&quot; reliability, and the Legend's timeless looks. Some cars are fashioned to be in style for a year or two. The legend's design always looks &quot;in&quot;. If you're straddling the border between a used/new car, I would highly recommend looking at a used Acura Legend. It's a well-engineered sporty luxury sedan that is a steal today.
