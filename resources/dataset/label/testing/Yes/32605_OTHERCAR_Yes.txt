            We owned an Impreza, but needed more room. My wife loved the way AWD made the car handle so we went back to the Subaru dealer. I drove the Legacy and fell for it. The price was a bit less then I thought I was going to pay, so it was a done deal. I can not think of anything i don't like about the car. The handling is awesome, especially on wet and slippery roads, I can take corners at high speeds and the car stays put. My wife put the AWD to the test the first winter we had it. She stopped on a hill that was covered with ice and snow, hit the gas, and tried to wreck it, to no avail. The car went straight up the hill! It was amazing! 
I can tell you that I will never buy another car as long as the Legacy is around. 
This car was made for the driver who wants to feel like he is in control of the car in any condition. Smooth acceleration and tight controlled steering compliment the handling of the AWD.
Other wonderful things include the great stereo/cd system, the room for adults in the rear seats and the killer sport look.
I would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
