            Overall, I think the '94 Pontiac Sunbird is a good car. It always runs great and never stalls. It has very good gas mileage because of the small engine (which provides adequate acceleration). The engine and exhaust are fairly quiet. The exhaust on mine is still in very good condition. The main muffler clamp broke once but it was inexpensive to repair. It has never had any major problems. Some of the minor problems include: worn out air conditioning compressor caused annoying loud noise; rear brake system  wore out and required work; several small patches of rust showed up on body; coolant had to be refilled often because of small leak (engine did not overheat). The car never "broke down."
