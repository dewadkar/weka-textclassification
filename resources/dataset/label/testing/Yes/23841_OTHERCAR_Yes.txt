            Well to Start off this is my first auto opinion I have written on epinions.

I recently too a long-term test drive of this vehicle. A friend of mine purchased one and allowed me to use it while he is overseas on a Un tour. 

My first thoughts standing outside of this car was it was ugly. Tall and not very long. Small tires and ovarall it looks wierd. 

The interior was even more wierd. When he first gave me the keys and I ventured inside it I was amazed by the fact its intruments are directly in the center of the dashboard. I figured that I would never get used to this. It has tons of storage spaces throughout the cabin. Two on the center part of the dash, and within 5 minutes of driving I was used to the strange cabin. It had tons of headroom. Im 6 ft tall and 180' pounds and I did not feel at all claustrophobic inside of it. It has a very nice stereo, and a very good air conditioner. Also, the double glove box is truly handy. I can keep my licence and registration in the top half and other items I needed frequently and the other useless tuff in the lower half. Very nice touch. the rear seatroom is apparently very good. one of my freinds Is a massive 6&quot;7' beast and he said that he had little problem back there. the trunk is adiquate for a small car. 

The instrument panel has a interesting set of features. It does however need a tachometer for the 5 speed manual, but it does have a cold engine warning, that tells you when the engine is ready to go. In Canada, I can relate to this. It is truly a good feature.


The steering on the car, allthough powered, has an impressive amount of feel. Its engine is extremly economical and strangely powerfull.<br><br>
