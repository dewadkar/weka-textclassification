            This car was bought pretty much on a whim, due to the previous car needing too many repairs.  So, Honda was the choice for reliability, unlike the other car.  I really like this car.  It is quiet, reliable, sporty, and sophisticated all at once.  This car also has the ability to go quite fast and quick too.  The V-TEC engine in the 2000 model is a nice addition by Honda, though the older models do have it.  Steering is tight, the brakes have yet to falter in the least, and the car runs perfectly every time we start it up.  The one thing about this vehicle is that, living in Ohio, we encounter some rough winters.  This is definitely not the car to be driving  on icy roads because it is so light.  Also, driving in snow can be a hassle because of how low the car is to the ground.  But, that put aside, I love this vehicle.  I recommend this vehicle for anyone who is looking for a car that is fun and not as typical as most sports coupes.  <br><br>
