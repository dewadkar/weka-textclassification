            Before I purchased a 2000 Limited Excursion I looked at Mercedes, BMW, and of Course, Chevrolet/GMC. My goal was to buy the best of breed � the category leader and I used the criteria of safety and utility. Economy, resource allocation, and other factors were not considered although I understand that the pollution level for this vehicle exceeds federal levels and that much of the vehicle is manufactured from recycled material � icing on the cake I suppose.

While looking at the Mercedes and BMW I thought great quality, but simply under powered and under sized carrying (realistically) only 4 people with minimal luggage � as compared to 6 people with massive luggage � yes the Excursion sits 8 legally, but 6 would be comfortable on a really long trip. The Chevrolet had better capacity than the German SUV�s but suffered in my opinion from poor manufacture (e.g. cheap welds where bolts should be, light doors, and an overall disturbing sense of cheapness).

I am unconcerned about its size and the fuel it consumes. I opted for the 7.3-liter turbo Diesel which I routinely get 13MPG around town and 22MPG on the freeway � this with 500-ft/lbs of torque, the Excursion is simply the most fuel-efficient and powerful SUV on the market, and considering it seats 8, with one of the smaller SUV�s � you would need to take two vehicles (eating up more fuel) which defeats the argument of fuel economy and still not have the towing capacity - that incidentally I need � albeit, not all 10,000 lbs as this Excursion can pull.

In so far as commuting in and out of a city � that is where the safety concern is paramount. With the ever increasing number of drivers increasing the potential of an accident that I and my family are exposed, I want to have size and power on my side. This comes at a price of maintenance and fuel � but skimping on a few dollars which would put my family at risk is simply not an alternative. Perhaps others can put such a value on their loved ones- I cannot. 

Inside Out

It is large, roomy, and comfortable, in every seat including the 3rd-row, which I cannot say the same for any other vehicle. I really liked the little German SUV�s, and did, very much, but it came right down to space, where the Excursion again is category leader. With 4 power-points (plus the cigar plug) are well placed, as are the cup holders � never get enough of those�

The Limited came with leather seats and wood grain trim that is just enough luxury in a nearly 4-ton beast. I have to hand it to Ford that they did not go over board here. The second row of seats folds in a 60/40 manner with the third row seats either folding or removed.  

Well, I suppose the outside looks is of personal taste � I like it, even if I was cool about the looks the two major criteria � space and safety � would have weighted higher than looks in my buying decision. I value substance over form in this regard. The rear door is the best of both worlds as you are protected by rain from above and you can easily reach in to the 3rd seat if need be without leaning over a tailgate. This is not a problem in the German SUV�s as they have so little space it is not an issue. The fact that the Excursion is built on the same platform as the world renown Super Duty trucks is most comforting as trucks are designed for a higher set of standards. Sure, they are not the cheapest in 5MPH bumper tests- but in a 7,400-LB SUV does one really need to be concerned about the bumper being dented?
 
Driving Impressions

My diesel is louder than a gas driven Excursion � but it gets roughly double the fuel economy and with 50% more torque, a fair trade in my opinion. I don�t even hear it any more � Ford did a great job in this regard and with the radio on low, I don�t even know it is running. It has sufficient get-up and go around town and on the freeway the turbo diesel does its job very well. 

I was shocked at the mileage truth be told. I knew it would b higher than my neighbors Suburban that gets about 6 in town and 10 on the freeway, but double that? I should not be surprised � my brother has a F350 Crew with the same engine and gets good mileage although he never closely tracked it (the Excursion has an on-board computer that calculates mileage, direction, temp, and miles to empty). Chevrolet used to offer a diesel � but pulled it as they had a considerable number of problems � according to the dealer where I test-drove the Suburban after test driving the Excursion. That was like going to Knott�s Berry Farm AFTER Disneyland � your setting yourself up for disappointment based on a previous high expectation. The door on the Ford is heavy and substantial � the Chevy door could have been on a Honda. 

I have driven all over downtown San Francisco and San Jose, up to the mountain in Mendocino, and throughout the Central Valley and I have no complaints. I even survived the parking lots of local shopping centers and have yet to be in a position where the Excursion�s size became a factor. Imagine that. 

Parting thoughts

The Excursion is not for everyone - expense and cost aside, it requires a competent driver simply because it handles very different than a car and quite honestly, not everyone needs this space and power, or wants the corresponding safety and security. I have commuted in it and it was a pleasure.

Okay, the one thing that drives me crazy about the Excursion is this - the design of the rear window is in such a way that it leaves streaks of water residuals on the lower barn-doors � and since my Excursion is black, it really sticks out.

Some suggest it is too big, drinks too much fuel, and is dangerous to other drivers. And they may be right if they drive small, relatively unsafe cars that trade weight (steel) for fuel economy, but then again, size DOES matter (for hauling and safety), the fuel economy of a single diesel Excursion is better than two little cars (on a per person basis), and as for being unsafe for OTHER drivers, I think the same thoughts when I drive with an 18-wheeler or a tank truck close by - regardless of what I drive.<br><br>
