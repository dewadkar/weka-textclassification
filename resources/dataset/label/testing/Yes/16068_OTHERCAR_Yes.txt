            I have just recently purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and absolutely love it.  This SUV is a complete turn around from the previous body style (1993-1998).  The new body style offers a more sleek appearance and greater aerodynamics.  

WHY I WANTED THIS JEEP?
Well...to tell you the truth, I looked at numerous SUV's such as the Lexus RX300, Toyota 4-Runner, and GMC Yukon/Taho and decided that the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited was just a better SUV for me (in my opinion).  I found out through epinions.com that the Toyota's had a history of oil problems (sludge).  Well...we all know that Lexus is just a fancy Toyota, so that ended that too.  I drove the Yukon/Taho and the two just seemed enormous on the road, and in my opinion quite bland in styling.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V8 was just equipped with every available option and had only 28,000 miles on when I purchased it.  The asking price on the Jeep was $23,900.00, which I was able to negotiate with that price.  I think I ended up giving about $21k including taxes (at that price...it rules out the Lexus and 4-Runner unless you go for an old one).  So, with the price right and it in perfect condition, I had to go with it.  And Hey...this is a $38,000.00 Jeep!

OPTIONS:
My 2000 Grand Cherokee Limited is Patriot Blue Pearl.  It is equipped with the 4.7 Liter V8 engine (now that engine will fly!!), sunroof, leather, heated seats, 3-disk In-dash CD player, keyless, towing, and all the other goodies.

PERFORMANCE:
I had a 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo V6 a few years back and it is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like my 2000 Limited I have today.  The 1997 was very "rocky" in the wind and roared on the interstate.  It also was a bit slow at starting off.  This new one rides extremely well and has all the power you need...and then some.  The Limited version of the Grand Cherokee is very luxurious, yet sporty and is really an eye catcher.  My Jeep is equipped with a FlowMaster Exhaust system and with this V8, it sounds NICE.  The take-off power is GREAT, it is extremely fast for an SUV and handles much like a car.  The Grand Cherokee takes curves very well and inclines great...but don't plan on doing a 360 or anything (which I hope you wouldn't anyway).  The brakes work great with no squeeks when stopping.  The engine is great and Jeep will tell you its built with Missle Technology.  I have Never had any problems with the engine.

PROBLEMS:
Only one minor problem...warranty covered it.  My front passenger side window had a minor air leak which was fixed in minutes with a rubber seal.  At 80mph you could hear a faint sound coming from the window (I am a freak about interior noises)...So, I had to have it fixed.  The Jeep has an air/heating system that might just be to advanced for me to understand.  It measures Cabin temperature and adjust the heat/air according to the two climate control settings.  Sometimes I can turn it to 85 or down 60 and it feels the same.  But, Jeep said it does that until the sensor reads the new temp reading?  But...when it decides to adjust, it works great!

WARRANTY:
Well...the Jeep dealer I take my Grand Cherokee is AWESOME.  They work with you every way they can and try to save you as much money as possible.  Get this...I AM NOT SHOOTING YOU A LINE HERE!!  I took my Grand Cherokee in and had the window looked at and asked them if they would just look the Jeep over and make sure nothing else needed fixing before my warranty was gone.  The service guy looked at my driver and passenger side front seats and said they have some small cracks in the piping (where the two pieces of leather are sewn together).  I knew that but did not think anything about it because my last Laredo did the very same thing.  He said..."Let me order you some new Leather seats."  I was like "Well, Ok...but they really are fine."  I mean, they looked great anyway, just for those small little cracks, but I got $2,000.00 worth of leather seats for FREE!  Now THATS some warranty!  So...after that, I bought the extended 75,000 mile warranty for $900.00.

The Grand Cherokee Limited V8 has all the features of a luxury car, but sports the aggressive styling of the Jeep.  It truely is a GREAT vehicle to have.  I am definatley going to let Jeep be my next SUV, should I decided to trade later on.
