            I am a truck lover from way back.  The GMC Yukon is a luxury truck, and I do mean truck.  I have a 1999 GMC 4DR 4WD SLT.  It looks like a luxury vehicle inside and out, it has a great ride, yet maintains that feel of a truck.  It has performed superbly in various off road environments including sand and mud.  I have hauled over 500 lbs of lumber with no problem.  The rear seats are easily folded down and just as easy to restore.  My one complaint about the rear seat storage is that the head rests have to be removed.  The Yukon can be configured with the traditional barn doors or the tailgate option at no extra charge.  I prefer the tailgate as it allows me to load longer pieces of lumber and quick access by popping the window open.  The barn doors seem to be preferred by those pulling trailers on a regular basis.  My favorite features are the amount of storage space and the safety features.  Dual airbags, 4 Wheel Anti-Lock Brakes, a heavy frame, and a clear 360 degree view from a high vantage point make this vehicle one of the safest to drive.  I wouldn't recommend this truck to people who have never driven a large vehicle or to people concerned about gas mileage.  If your a truck lover and want to ride in luxury, this is the vehicle for you.<br><br>
