            This is an extraordinary item. Some things I enjoy about it are the 1.8 inch LCD screen, compact size and weight, and the many different features such as date/time, picture quality/compression/size,  and the Consecutive Shots feature, which allows you to take 9 rapid consecutive photographs, such as a golf swing. 

I purchased this camera in an auction (http://auctions.yahoo.com) for $290. I bought it because it's many different features and low price. So far, my experience with this camera has been great. It works beautifully, along with the beautiful pictures it takes. Using this camera almost convinced me to become a photographer! Very superior product. 

This product is pretty basic and easy to use. Some things that I wish were different is battery life. The camera runs on 4 AA batteries, which only last for about 1 1/2 hours of photographing. Using the LCD screen, which can be turned on/off, usually contributes to less battery life. But overall, this camera has been a big part of my life and I enjoy it very very much. This camera is highly recommended to everyone by me.<br><br>
