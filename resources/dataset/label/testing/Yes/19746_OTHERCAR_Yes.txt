            The Oldsmobile Silhouette is an outstanding minivan with an array of useful features.  It is also well designed and fun to drive.  With a peppy engine, good handling, and tight cornering.  Also living in Colorado the Silhouette does great in the snow.  Among the neat options are an automatic sliding door, traction control, front and side impact airbags, automatic inflating tires, good stereo, front and rear divided audio, and four doors.  I could spend all day naming the options and features that make the car better and safer.  Also, I feel extremely safe and comfortable when driving it.  I have had few problems with it and it is extremely reliable.  Overall this is one of the best avaliable for the money.<br><br>
