            I lease a 1998 Saturn SL2 automatic.  For those of you in the Market for a Used Saturn .. this is a good bet.  It has been a joy to drive and is very reliable. It handles well and is peppy enough to get out of its own way however, it is no hot rod. It is also a real gem in the snow ( I am from Pittsburgh) moving over snow covered hill and dale with ease.  I wanted a small car that was easy on gas and dependable.  I was also looking for a few extras to make it comfortable. For example the adjustable seat is a great feature that sold me on the SL2 as compared to an SL. My husband is 6'3' and I am 5'3' so we crank the seat down for him and crank it up for me.  Works great! I have been in this car for long trips and it works fine but, I would not say it is totally comfortable for longer than a few hours. I see this as a short trip car!   The power windows are quick however, I do not like the placement of the switch in the middle of the console. This is very hard to get used to and it makes no sense to have them there, it is easy to hit the wrong button!  The sunroof is great although there is a great deal of road noise when it is open compared to other cars I have owned (Honda)  I have the Radio with Graphic Equalizer and it is adequate.   In general, there is still a pretty good bit of road noise but not as bad as past years(I am told) It has not bothered me .. I just turn the radio up and drive. The heater and defrosters work really well and when I slap on the Air when defrosting.. it is done in a snap.   The is a great little car for zipping around town and hauling home some groceries and packages. Overall a real winner!
