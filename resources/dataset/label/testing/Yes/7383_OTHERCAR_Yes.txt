            I own a 4 door AUDI A6, and am now looking for smaller and sportier car. My obvious next choice was the S4 as I love Audis. However, being from Europe and very familiar with rally races and cars, I was very excited with the news of the WRX crossing the pond. Subaru rally cars are very popular there and have been offering fun and performance for years. 

They are light, quick, economical, and roomy.
The WRX offers performance close to the AUDI's although style, quality, and engineering are no match for the German automaker.
Well, after looking for a used 2001 S4, all in the 32 to 38k range, I decided to pay more attention to the new Subaru WRX US version. For 8 to 15k less, I can drive as fast as the Audi, and handling is also about as efficient. Both offer allwheel drive. I have a big luxury SUV to travel with the kids in safety, so I thought I could forget about the AUDI's comfort, classiness, and engineering. I had heard great things about the WRX, how much fun it is, how it puts a big smile on your face.

I decided to go the dealership and drive one. From the moment I drove out of the lot, I fell in the love. I felt like a kid with his new favorite toy, I had this stupid grin on my face! The Sales Rep, a retired UPS driver, was holding tight to the door handle! This car is wicked fast, it is like magic. Makes you wonder how such a small 4 cylinder 2liter engine can put out so much power and give you more sensation, power, and speed than one of those supposedly fast American V8 sport cars. Those 227 horse power will take you to 60 in 5.6 seconds, about as fast as a S4, A BOXTER S, a S2000, etc...

The car is very stable, handles absolutely perfectly in most conditions, and I would say in all conditions that 95% people will face in their life. The AWD makes it a great car to drive during the winter too. It handles well on slippery pavement and gravel. I would defintely opt for the 17 inch wheels as they provide better grip and less tire wall flex. You can feel the difference and it looks better, more substantial!

Inside, the front seats are first grade. They offer fantastic lateral support but are also comfortable. The material is nice and easy to clean. The rear seats offer enough leg room and are above average for the class, even more so considering it is a sport car. A smalll family of four will find enough room for their 2 kids and baggages. The trunk is pretty big. For a small car, it offers decent room inside. 

OUTSIDE, no comments!! I love it but you probably hate it!! Whatever your opinion is, it is original. The flared sides add to the rally look as does the air intake on the hood. It actually works!!! Put bigger wheels on that car, opt for the short shifter and titanium knob. The momo steering wheel feels real good in aggressive driving conditions and still offers Airbag. The titanium pedal and accessories also makes the interior look sportier.

The driving experience is unbeatable for 24k. Acceleration will get you stuck to your seat and that is an unbelievable feeling you usually can get for less than 40 or 50k!!\GO DRIVE IT!!!!!
