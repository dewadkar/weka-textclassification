            We purchased the 1999 CRV-Lx. We test drove all the comparable SUV's(Kia's, Trackers, ect.) but found no comparison.The CRV does not rattle like the others. The seats are comfortable. The interior is roomy and easy to move from front seat to back seat.The front seat reclines completely back and with head rest off it makes almost a bed out of the front seat and back seat. The gas mileage is excellent. We especially like the two plug ins. It is convenient for long trips.
The two negative things that we have found are: 1. the locking system is slightly a pain. You have to unlock back doors from front doors and only drivers side has master lock. This is inconvenient when putting a child in the back seat. You have to unlock three doors! The other negative is the interior. I would have preferred a plain seat instead of the odd pattern that it comes with. But we went with the grey which wasn't too bad.
I think that the convenience, easy handling, gas mileage, and low insurance rates are all definite advantages of this vehicle. I would definitely purchase another CRV.
Also, Honda is a very reliable company. I have owned 5 Honda's and have never been disappointed in the customer service I have received.
