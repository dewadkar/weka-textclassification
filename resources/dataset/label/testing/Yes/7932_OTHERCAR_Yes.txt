            I am writing this opinion because I feel I'm fairly educated in regards to Jeep Wranglers being that I have owned two myself.  My first Jeep was a rebuilt 1979 CJ-7.  This was a great SECOND car but by no means a reliable car to drive everyday.  I used this car for entertainment purposes only due to the fact that it was an extremely bumpy ride, not comfortable for long periods of time driving and very loud.  

The car I specifically writing about is my last previous car which I drove for two years.  This was a 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport 4X4.  If you are interesting in purchasing this car there are many pros and cons that I feel you should know about.  I guess a few years after selling my '79 Jeep I began to think that I really wanted a newer model.  So, I began my research.

PROS
It's no doubt a &quot;fun&quot; vehicle.  I live in a major city so most of my driving time was city miles.  Many days of the summer spent with the top down and is no doubt an eye catcher for many people.  At night, it was wonderful to drive with the top down.  I had a 6 cylinder which came in handy in pulling my jet skis, but my sister has a 1999 Jeep wrangler 4 cylinder and it handled the load with no difficulty either.  I opted for more power which driving on the highway in Dallas is almost a necessity to get on the highway.  More power = faster speed in less time.  

CONS
If you are interested in a Jeep, please consider opting for the extended warranty.  I bought my 1997 jeep in the first of 1998 with little miles.  I purchased the extended warranty which came in handy.  My factory warranty ended at 36,000 miles and it 40,000 miles the top formed a tear in the seam extended from the windshield all the way to the back of the top of the jeep.  At 60,000 miles my differential axle busted which was a whopping $2,000 at the dealership that was covered by the extended warranty all the while the furnished a rental car for me to drive.  

Fortunately, the wheel base in the model is wider than previous years so I felt comfortable driving at speeds of 70-80 miles without worrying about flipping but the wind noise on the soft top was uncomfortable and extremely loud.  No doubt over time you will get used to this noise or you will end up selling because of it.  You either like it or hate it.  I grew to like it because I upgraded my stereo system to drown out some of the noise.  

Another con is the soft tops.  This is no doubt a welcoming invite for thieves to enter your car.  Over a two and a half year span, I had my car broken into 4 times.  3 of which the thief entered my car by slashing the plastic windows.  This is also a hassle if you don't have a garage.  For me, I don't have a garage.  This also meant, that every time I wanted to take my top off (which alone is a strenuous process that can take up 20 minutes) I had to also put it back on at the end of the day.  It is inevitable that your plastic windows over time will become somewhat of a foggy or less transparent look.  Mine in case were scratched very easily.  

Another issue to address is space.  I forgot how much of a packrat I am and how much stuff I actually lug around.  This is not the vehicle for you if you are the same.  I could never go anywhere and leave anything at all in my car for fear of it being stolen.  Every time I remember this, it was always too late.  I was already where I needed to be and totally forgot and would end up lugging around a big duffle bag(at the mall for example).  Most people would probably remember these things, but again, I'm not like most people so I'm touching on this topic for a FYI for some who it would also apply to.

Overall, I would say this car would be perfect for someone in their teens to midtwenties.  I'm 26 and after having the luxuries of a car, began to miss those luxuries after driving a jeep.  I would love to own another one, but not as my primary means of transportation.

**********Revised 6.26.00************
As per request on a comment, I'll give a little more helpful info.  As I said before, my sister has a Jeep practically identical to mine.  One major difference is the seating.  I opted for the vinyl seats which was a big mistake.  In the summertime, it gets extremely hot and very easy to sweat.  My sister had cloth interior which was extremely comfortable.  The vinyl seats also with time developed cracks which should not have happened because I always kept them clean and cleaned them with the recommended solution.  The seats were pretty comfortable in regards to adjustments but the material in the vinyl made them uncomfortable.  

In regards to how it handles, I put 30&quot; tires on my Jeep so it handled relatively well.  The only time(s) it somewhat scared me was when I unexpectedly took a corner and found out the street was a tad wet and I did a complete 180.  That took me for a little loop.  Over the course of owning my Jeep, I did this several times.  But, it handled really well.  <br><br>
