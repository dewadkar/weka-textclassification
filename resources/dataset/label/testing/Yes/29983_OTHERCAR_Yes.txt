            The Dodge Caravan is the bomb yo! I mean come on, look at the beautiful luxury 7 seats in the interior. Wow, thats really great! Plus in my model car, I have the TV and VCR, which is great to help keep the kids busy in the back seats. The car is dead quiet, and another plus is that it has 4WD!! WOW! Thats amazing especially in cold and wet weather. The interior is great and the dual sliding doors is better. THe inside is much more spacious than that stupid Ford Windstar thing, yuck! It's a really good car and any family man would love driving around in it, plus the price aint so bad, average price- 26,000. thats pretty darn good! Get a caravan!<br><br>
