                 I don't what Ford's reasoning is when it comes to their vehicles at times.  I'm not talking about design so much as I'm talking about their decisions to discontinue certain models.
     My family owns not one but two Aerostars.  We purchased both of them used.  The first of these is a 93' Aerostar in white with the XLT option and power everything.  The second is a 95' Eddie Bauer Edition Green XLT that is decked out.  We purchased the 93' in 1995 and purchased the 95' last year.  The 95' had 84,000 miles on it at the time of purchase while the 93' had 17,500 miles on it.
     How many serious problems have we had with these two excellent vans?  None.  Outside of regular maintenance, how often do they visit the shop?  I think between the two of them we've taken the 93' in once for a simple fuel filter fix.
     The Aerostar is incredibly spacious and reliable.  Passenger comfort is this vehicle's strong point.  Fuel economy is excellent for extended-length vehicles like these.  Handling is excellent, and visibility is great.
     On the downside the van's seats in the 93' model aren't tall enough to support taller passengers to the fullest.  With both models removing the very back seat to use the extra cargo space is a two-man chore; however thankfully the 95' has a fold-down rear seat (an option I strongly recommend).  Opt for the larger engine size as well- while the 93' has the smaller engine an can handle most tasks the 95' with its larger engine is the one we use for serious road trips.
     Simply put the Aerostar is an excellent choice for the used van buyer, and far outpaces the Windstar (which is prone to technical problems).  So Ford, why exactly did you discard excellence in exchange for the Windstar?<br><br>
