            This was my first "real" car. My parents helped me buy it when I graduated high school. After driving a 1986, run-down old Mazada 626 for a year and a half in high school I was so very excited to get this car.
We wanted a hatchback car because it was a low cost compact, but not as compact as a compact car and hatchbacks didn't have the bad stigma attached to them. 
The first brand we looked at was Ford. They had just come out with the Ford 'Focus' and so we found one with in our price range that had all the features such as security alarm, power windows and things like that. The car just didn't feel like it was made very well. It just wasn't solid enough to be a good buy. We felt as though the dealership threw in all those extras in an effort to make the car look better.
On the way home we stopped by the local Honda dealership and went straight to the 2000 Honda Civic Hatchbacks. When I opened the door to get in I could feel that this was a solid, well-made vehicle. I pressed down on the gas pedal and the break pedal and it just felt sturdier and stronger than the Ford 'Focus'. 
If you don't believe it, DO THE EXPERIMENT: Go around to different car dealerships such as Saturn, Ford, Mitsubishi, ect.. then open and shut the car doors. Listen to the sound they make. Get in the car and listen as you shut the door. Then go to the Honda dealership and get in a new Honda and listen as you shut the car door. The Honda cars will sound like you just shut a vault door, a very sturdy sound.

THE LEG ROOM in the back seat is amazing. From the outside one would think that the car would not have much room at all, but for me It felt almost as if I were in a 4 door sedan. I still own the car and EVEN TO THIS DAY, when friends get into the back seat they say something about the amount of room they have to move around. A friend of mine owns a Mitsubishi 'Eclipse' which is a 2 door car and there is SO LITTLE LEG ROOM in the back that your knees are up to your chest. So after riding in that car, my 2000 Honda Civic Hatchback is a big relief.

THE CONTROLS ON THE FRONT CONSOLE are simple yet effective. They just make sense -- much more sense when compared to other brands of cars -- The glove compartment is large and there are two other compartments to store sunglasses or maps or anything else. The two large cup holders have an adapter so that if you have a 'slimmer' sized cup, it will also fit; the cup holders have a slot so that your coffee cup handle will fit in also.

I HAVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION (stick shift) and I find that I have more control and power in a car with one. My neighbor has a Honda with an automatic transmission and he tells me that they both have an equal amount of power. My 2000 Honda Civic Hatchback drives incredibly solid. Even after these three years of owning it, the car still sounds smooth and glides down the highway.

THE GAS MILEAGE IS WONDERFUL. I usually put around $14 in gas in the car a week. $14 dollars is a full tank of gas and that will last me at least five days if not up to one week. It's wonderful. That amount of time increases when I don't have classes everyday, I can go over a week without having to put gas in my car.

THE TURNING RADIUS in this car is amazing. When driving in Downtown Atlanta I can whip in and out of traffic, take extremely tight curve and I can turn completly around on a narrow street without having to back up and go froward to adjust. I just turn the wheel and its like the front tires just turn in a 90 degree angle to the car or something, it's wonderful. 

THE BACK SEAT folds down give you ample trunk space. I had to move out of my apartment over Christmas. My Dad and I moved everything I owned, furniture and all in one trip using my trunk with the back seat down and the back of his van. 

THE DEALERSHIP that I bought my car from gave me a great deal and a lifetime of free oil changes at their facilities. I have had my oil changed on time, every time. The water level is filled and the antifreeze is checked. The oil filter is also changed each time. I have treated my Honda well and it is still running perfectly. It's only three years old, but it has started and ran perfectly since the first day I drove it home. I plan to have this car for another 10 years, I'm sure I will save a ton of money.

It's just a great car to own. It stands up to all of the 4 door sedans and then races past them.
