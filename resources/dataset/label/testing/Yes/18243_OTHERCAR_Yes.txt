            I have been driving this car for a little over 4 months. I bought this Volvo 854 used with all maintenance records and 61K miles on odometer. I must say that I have driven quite a few European brands including VW, MB and Audi. This is my first Swedish brick, as they are called sometimes.
Overall grade is �B�. However I did spend some money for routine maintenance, replaced brakes and rotors, rear engine mount and front engine seal. When you shop for this car first thing to check is an air conditioner, if compressor cycles often then most likely your evaporator core will need to be replaced, $900 job, second weak spot is door stop mount, welding cracks and door stop no longer prevents it from closing, another $300.
I would pay attention to tires and wheels, those OEM are super expensive but they are well made and look beautifully on Volvos. 
1994 model year cars came with quite a few major fixes, I would suggest if you shop for 850 look for 94 and on. If you are handy and plant to service the car yourself, cars of 93-95 allow you to read and clear codes by using their diagnostic unit without expensive code scanners. It helps a lot to know what is going on under the hood.

At the end of the day, if you like IKEA furniture style and functionality you will love this car. Cheap plastic does rattle, but it doesn�t bother me much. My 854GLS is not a racer, because it is not  a Turbo, but it is good for touring and everyday commute� and Volvo�s seats are unbelievably comfortable� I wish I can get a chair for my living room as comfortable as those, and if they are heated it is even better. Good luck on this one.
