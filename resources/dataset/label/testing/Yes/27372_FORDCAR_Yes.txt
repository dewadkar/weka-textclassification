            A friend of mine recently went on vacation, and loaned me their new truck for a few days.  What a great opportunity!!  I loved it!

The F-150 SuperCrew pickup is a great looking full size pickup truck. It combines style and practicability. The basic model is well equipped and Ford offers even more options for those who would like to upgrade.

There are 2 different engines to choose from.  Both engines are V8, the smaller being a 4.6L and the more powerful is a 5.4L. The transmission comes equipped with is a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.

The truck I drove has the V8, 5.4L engine, the 4-Speed automatic with overdrive, and the 4-wheel drive.  It had 4-wheel disc brakes with 4-wheel anti-lock (ABS). It has a Cargo weight capacity of up to 1,700 lbs. and a towing capacity: 7,700 lbs.

The interior was quite a surprise.  It was almost too fancy to be a truck.  The leather seats were high quality, it has a remote keyless entry and comes with chrome wheels.  The gauges and controls are very easy read and reach. The sound quality from the AM/FM stereo radio was very good and a CD player can be added as an option.

The SuperCrew has four full size doors to enter the front and the rear and this makes it very easy to get in. Even large adults can sit very comfortably in the rear. This interior would make possible to go on a long drive with this pickup truck.

The exterior is the most stylish that I have seen. The paint job is excellent and has a top protective coating that shines like the sun.  It also has a protective liner on top of the rear cargo box.  The SuperCrew model offers a full size rear seat cabin, and is comfortable for the largest adults, even on a long trip.  It looks, feels, and handles more like a luxury car than a truck.
