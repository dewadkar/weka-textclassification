            (This is a review based on the performance I experienced through a three-year time span owning this vehicle)


  Loved it! Out of every vehicle I have owned this was my favorite and most dependable. I would still have a Mazda pickup today, but with two small children it would be somewhat crowded.

  When I first got the Mazda B2000 it was instant love. Over the course of three years this truck was driven back and forth from Minnesota to Florida, racking on the miles. When I wasn�t driving to Florida I was dealing with the harsh winters Minnesota had to offer and boy did this little truck shine. The truck never got stuck in the snow in three years and the visibility through the windows was tremendous compared to most cars I have driven.

  The Mazda B2000 I had was very simple with no options, it was simple a 4 cylinder with rear wheel drive and a manual five speed transmission.    Though the truck didn�t offer much as options it pulled through everytime for me and the only time I ever brought it into a mechanic was for regular tune-ups and one flat tire.

  The not so wonderful side of this truck was the classic Mazda rusting for in older vehicles, the bumpers and mirrors rusted pretty good. I really didn�t mind so much about the appearance of the truck because the endurance was so great. 

  By the end of the three years it has over 220,000 miles on it and still ran great when I sold it. So if you�re looking for a truck with the ability to have high miles I would really recommend a Mazda.

Boy do I miss my Mazda!
