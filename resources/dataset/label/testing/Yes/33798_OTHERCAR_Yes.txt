            A couple caveats about the Cooper S:
It's a sports car, not a compact car
The trunk is small, by most standards
It's a standard transmission only

A couple caveats about myself: 
I don't play golf, 
I don't need to fit armoires in my trunk
I like chrome 
I live in an urban center.

The MINI fits me; it may not fit you.

I recently got my MINI Cooper S.  To the dismay and confusion of many, I put down money on the car without ever driving it.  But, I did the research and read the reviews.  I did test drive a MINI Cooper; but I knew at the time that the bigger, super-charged engine would only be bigger-faster-stronger.  I was right.

<b>Performance</b>
This car goes where you want when you want.  When I've gotten it out onto the highway, it floats along in sixth gear at 65mph.

If you are an experienced standard driver, this car is a dream. Acceleration is amazing.  Imagine a go-cart with 163 horsepower.  After experiencing the 0-60, it does get a little depressing driving the MINI in stop-and-go downtown traffic.

The excellent weight balance is helped by the battery in the trunk.  It's hidden under the floor of the trunk.  If your trunk is filled with (not alot of) stuff, you can still give a boost through the front of the car.

Whip around corners and watch the car stick to the road.

<b>Looks</b>
Chrome everywhere.  On the outside, there's the chrome fuel door.  It gets locked up with the car.  There's also the dual-exhaust in chrome.

I like the big dials.  They're easy to read and nice to look at.  The speedometer is in the center of the dash.  I don't mind it there because I'm pretty aware of my own speed.  I don't need to look over that much.  Some people aren't too keen on its location there.

Why should cars be one color?  I'm fond of the black or white roof on the MINI.  You could get a body color-matching roof if you wanted.

<b>Many minor details</b>
I need a cup-holder that holds a big cup.  The MINI has three cupholders: 2 above the gearshift and 1 behind the emergency brake.  The one at the back (easily reached from the front seat) holds any mega-gulp sized drink.  The two at the front don't.  When you open the glove compartment, there's a confusing tray with 2 more spots for drinks (like the indentations on airline tray tables)

I need a horn that announces my presence.  The MINI has a big-American-car sounding horn, not anything that closely resembles the roadrunner's.

I need a sunroof.  The MINI has a sunroof that covers about two-thirds of the total roof.  Although MINI describes it as "panoramic" it is divided into two sections.  The front two-thirds opens up while the back two-thirds stays shut.  There's a mesh screen that can partially block out the sun on the hottest of days.

I need heated seats.  So, I opted to get those as well on mine because I live in a relatively cold climate.  Since it's August, it'll be a few months before I can properly test them out.  Heated seats are extra.

<b>Parking</b>
Obviously, with a small car you can park just about everywhere no one else can.  Also, consider that if you live in a condo of have a small garage that you could also fit a motorcycle into 1 spot - <i>with room to spare</i>.

<b>Fuel</b>
Cooper S wants to be fed premium unleaded.  It's not that much of a pain at the pump because the car is so fuel efficient.  It's no hybrid but 24 mpg city and 33mpg highway is pretty good.  Remember: it's a sports car, not a compact car.

<b>Interior</b>
Vents open and close with a quick twist.  Simple and easy.

There's a 12v socket in the trunk if need be.

<b>Minor negative details</b>
The windshield wipers need only the slightest nudge to turn them off.  I've found myself accidentally turning them on while entering or exiting the car.  The icons are also a little hard to decipher.

The stereo buttons are also a little confusing to get used to.  Since I opted for the multi-function steering wheel, I usually control the radio and cd player from there.  My passengers have been confused by the radio so I don't think the layout is that intuitive.

The front seats don't easily jump forward for your rear passengers.  I find mine a little stiff to return to their original position.

Although there's a lot of headroom for passengers (front and back), tall people will feel cramped if you have four passengers.

I wish the pedals were metal, it would make the car even sportier.

=========================

An update:

After a year of owning the car, I haven't had any major problems.  The only minor repair was to the rim between the roof and windows.  It popped out but it was replaced by the dealer.

I would caution anyone from buying the automatic version of the first MINI Cooper release.  A friend of mine has one, and she has had no end of problems with it.  The last I heard, the entire transmission had been replaced.
