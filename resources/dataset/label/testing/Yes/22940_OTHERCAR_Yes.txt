            I have a Shearwood Green 1996 Honda Accord Ex.  When I first started looking for a car, I immediatly was attracted to Honda because of there dependability, awesome style and ease of the drive.  This is actually my first car and boy, am I glad I have this him!  (Yes I did name my car)  He is very comfortable to drive in, I find all the seats great for even long periods of time, althought I really don't want to sit in any other that my driver's seat!  To be honest I love everything about this car!  From the way it looks, drives, and makes me smile whenever I look at him!  I love my car!  Driving him is great, there is very little if any road noise, the only other car that was better with no road noise was the 2000 Accord, that I had the privilidge of driving.  And Sorry Mercedes but I think it beats out you guys too! His reliability is excellent, the only things that I have done is change oil and of course gas.  He does get awesome gas milage too!  On the comfort scale he would defentaly be a 10, plus some, I have actually slept in the seats and woke up feeling fine!  He's an excellent car and I recommend anyone who is looking for a excellent all around car, what are you waiting for?  Go get your own!  ^_^  Even though this is my first car I think he is my best car I'll have!!!  Thanks for reading! =) <br><br>
