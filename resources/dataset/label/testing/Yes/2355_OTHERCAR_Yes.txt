            The PDR-M4 was the first camera that I owned.  It is easy to use and takes little time to learn the features.  It's a point and click camera although the camera may take a few seconds to adjust to extreme light conditions and to auto-focus.  This camera is ideal for recreational photography and sending pictures to friends across the internet.  The download process from camera to computer is quick and easy; an added bonus is the USB connection that comes along with the camera.  Another plus is the size of the camera; it can fit in your pocket without you having to worry that it might accidentally break while in your pocket.

I know next to nothing about photography, but this camera is pretty much automated so you won't have to worry about the details.  If you do want to modify the details, this camera will allow you to do that as well.
