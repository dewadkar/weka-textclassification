            Not too long ago I decided it was high time to ditch the old fashioned camera and buy a digital camera, and then I looked at prices and rethought the whole matter.  For one thing, the price range from the cheapest to the top of the line was staggeringly large.  The features were too much to contend with, for the beginner at least, and I ended up not knowing what to buy.  Several months, price drops, and a little bit of information later I was finally ready to look again, and so it was that I came across the HP PhotoSmart 618.

<b>The good....
</b>This camera, for the average beginning user, is probably among the best as far as I can tell.  It has a lot of features, including (but certainly not limited to):
--Zoom (not a huge zoom, but still not bad) Lense
--LCD display
--Lots of flash options, from the simplest most automated to a more specific type for your needs
--Timer and/or remote control for taking your own pictures
--Capability to send pictures directly to new HP Printers via infrared technology
--Fast USB connection for downloading pictures to a computer
--RCA jack Hook up for viewing pictures on any TV
--Ability to add sound clips to any picture file
There are more that I am sure I am missing, but these are the ones that I found most useful.  Picture quality is easily changeable between good, better, and best.  Size is also easily changed, the combination of the two determines how many pictures you will be able to fit on one flashcard before it's full, for example at the best quality setting, half size pictures, you can fit 52, so easily comparable (actually better) than a normal camera.  Of course, with the LCD display you can instantly see if your photo turned out as you planned, so getting a picture back from the store with a thumb in it is a thing of the past.  The menu on the LCD display is very easy to use, with a little practice, not hard to learn at all.  The camera is sturdy, well built, and easy to hold.  The battery life (despite some other reviews I have read) is fine for the average person.  Now if you are going to carry 50 flashcards and take pictures in the hundreds at a time, you might not agree, but for most of us I think battery life is fine.  I have been using it for months now and I am still on full.  All controls are easy to use also, and easily accessible.

<b>The Bad...</b>
Here again, the zoom is not the most flexible, for lack of a better word.  There is a small zoom range, and you can get fairly close to far away objects, but I am quite sure there are better zooming cameras on the market.  Aside from that my only other complaint is this:  when you pay $400 for a camera of any sort, and there is a big old LCD display on the back of it, subject to getting damaged or scratched, shouldn't it come with a case??  Of course I know in today's world the way to make money is to sell products that almost necessitate accessories, but not to <i>give</i> any of those accessories away for free.  Possibly a rechargeable battery would be nice too, but again I must stress that if you are just the average picture taker you will not run into a battery problem, despite what you might read in other reviews here or elsewhere.  

<b>To sum it up....(since there is no "ugly")</b>
This camera is several hundred dollars down from where it started when it came out months ago, too bad for HP I guess, but great for us consumers.  So you truly are getting a feature packed camera for a good price.  I was slightly concerned about the cost of printing photos when I thought about changing from conventional cameras to a digital camera, but I have to say after looking now it's not a big difference.  You can get Kodak paper for a fairly good price, and even if you don't already have a photo capable printer, they don't cost that much.  Mine is an older one (printer) but has photo printing capability, but even the newest HP (with the infrared transfer capability, etc) is only around $280.  Besides, I have also realized that I don't really need all of my photos on paper, I am ok with having the majority on disk to e-mail to friends and family, or keep on disk, since paper ends up fading over time anyway.  As for those photos you do want to reprint and save, remember with a photo printer and digital camera you can edit, crop, and enlarge your own photos, so in the end I think this is the cheaper way to go as opposed to the old fashioned way, but it's all relative to what you want to do.  In case you are wondering, the easiest way to download from the camera is via USB, which works well (as I mentioned I had some problems, but not the fault of the camera) and is quick, taking only a second or two per picture.  
So, this is an excellent camera for the price, which is pretty low really.  Takes great pictures, is easy to use, and will probably last a long time.  I recommend it without hesitation.
