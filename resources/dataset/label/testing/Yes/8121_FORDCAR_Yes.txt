                I really like this vehicle because its not too large to fit in my garage and it will fit into any parking space. We bought ours a year and a half ago before it was really even out.If you have no kids, it's a great SUV to own but not really practical with children.The two door feature makes having rear seat passengers a pain in the neck. This SUV has plenty of cargo space though,especially when you put the rear folding seats down.The front seating area could be better though.As a rider in the passenger seat,you can sometimes feel claustrophobic.

    This SUV has probably the best turn radius i've ever seen.You can make a U-turn anywhere.The acceleration is outstanding and I think this car might have too much power for its own good.If you accelerate through a turn too quickly,you feel a lack of vehicle control for a moment.Beware, when you are transporting people in the back seat,you can also feel that lack of vehicle control also.The rack and pinion feature for steering is nice but it is also extremely touchy.

I don't need to tell you about the big tire recall but make sure you get them replaced with STEEL belted radials rather then simple radial tires.The reason is that this  vehicle is very powerful through turns and during turns,your riding on the inside and outside areas of the tire.This causes very high stress on tread of the tire and could possibly damage the tire and lose control of the vehicle. 

   The gas mileage is horrible and it could have something to do with the horsepower ratio of acceleration to vehicle weight. We can't even make it from orange county to Las Vegas on a single tank of gas. With gas prices as they are, this is the biggest drawback of this vehicle.We have also got around ten or so letters regarding either a recalled part of the vehicle(outside of the tire snafu)or some other problem that requires us to bring it in to the dealer. However,we have had no mechanical problems at all. 

     I would still definitely recommend this Vehicle and I believe all the bugs will be worked out for the next years models.
