            I want to tell you that I will buy another Nissan Maxima because of its safety. 

My 16 year old son lost control of my '96 Maxima SE, crossed the median of a four lane highway and hit another car head-on at about 50 mph. 

I am happy to tell you that our Maxima did its job in the safety department! While the car was totaled, my son was virtually unhurt. He came out of the accident with a bruised right knee and a fracture of his left hip bone. If you could have seen the car, you would understand how minor these injuries are. 

My Maxima's airbags deployed, the crumple zones crumpled and I could see from the damage to the car that the force of the impact went around the passenger compartment instead of in to it. 

Thank you, Nissan. You have a customer for life, both literally and figuratively!
