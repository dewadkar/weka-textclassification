            To begin with, I have owned several cars including Mercedes, Volvo, VW, and know what cars in this class are supposed to deliver.

When I found my 1995 90, I was actually out looking for BMW's that week and had taken several for test drives.

The Beemers are nice solid cars, but like Mercedes, are rear wheel drive unless you go to a sport model with AWD.

They were preparing the Beemer, and asked me to test drive the Audi. After test driving it, i did not want to even look at the BMW. This car sold me in 20 minutes!

The standard options are headlamp washers, heated locks, heated mirrors, heated washer sprayers, heated seats, Bose sound system, Theft detterent, remote locks, 2 program transmission for sport or economy driving and electronically governed at 130 mph as are all audis.

I bought it on a very snowy day and drove it home and it stuck to the road like glue. This is the front wheel drive model,  not the 4x4 quattro. I was extremely impressed. The shifting is so smooth you have to watch your speed because even at 120 mph you cannot feel it.

And you can steer with one finger while changing lanes like a Indy racer, it handles that well. The comfort and ride are exceptional for a smaller car, it feels like you are in  amuch larger car when hitting speeds over 50mph, it starts to float like it is a Cadillac.

This car is not fast from the start. It is nominal, you will not be squeeling the tires from a light. However, the 6 cyl engine seems to just start waking up around 45-50 mph and then it is gone like the wind.

I live in a very hilly area, and when I got home the wife was spinning the Camry all over and could not even get it in our driveway. This Audi took the snow hills and ice better than any 2 wheel drive vehicle I have ever driven.

4 disc brake system with 4 wheel anti lock makes stopping a dream. 2 airbag system for both front seats make it very safe as well. And do not be fooled by this car's size..I have a Volvo 850 wagon and a Ford Explorer XLT 4x4, and this car is heavier than the wagon, and just 200 lbs lighter than my truck...solid!

It has a galvanized body that is coated on the insides with wax prior to assembly, so these cars will look showroom after 12 years if taken care of. Rust is really not an issue. The exhaust systems are warrantied for 80,000 miles!

Though it not a screamer like my Volvo, it does the job when it gets going, and the smooth ride and handling are not to be believed until you actually drive one. I liked it so much, I went out a week later and got my wife the Audi A4 Quattro so she can have 4x4 all the time.

But it is a German car. Meaning parts and labor can be rough when repairs are needed. But take into account that a car of lesser quality will break several times in the time this one breaks once, you will put the same if not less into it over a 10 year period. The only question is, do you want to do it over a 10 year period or all at once? Avoid dealers unless it is warranty related.

But for safety, reliabilty, and comfort in a smaller car you will not get better than this. I found the ride to be smoother than BMW or Mercedes and the handling is second to none. Anyone who drives these cars will tell you the same thing.

Try it! You'll like it!
