            Have had a BMW and another Mercedes.

Bought it because I loved the way it looked and drove.

After 8 months, I still love to drive it. It's a little anemic around town, but on the highway, you would think it was supercharged. (Have received the only two speeding tickets in my 62 years driving it.)

AND on straight highway driving we get around 33 MPG!!!

Not one problem, although it's about time for the 60,000 mile maintenance, and that's close to $500. Still, I want to take care of &quot;my baby&quot;.

My old BMW 318i was my previously favorite car. Every time I got out of it, I'd say to myself: &quot;God, I love that car&quot;. Finally found another I can say that about.

It drives flawlessly, with no effort. The ride is firm, yet extremely comfortable. Doesn't wear you out like a lot of smaller cars.

I like the fact that 95% of the people can't tell it's a five year old car, and it still looks new.
