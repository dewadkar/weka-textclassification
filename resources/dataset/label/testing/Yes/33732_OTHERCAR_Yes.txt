            A friend of mine recently bought a 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD. He kept telling me to drive it. I finally did when he said it was faster than my ride(a 91 Mustang GT w/5spd). To tell you the truth It blew my mind. It has a turbocharged and intercooled 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine(my GT has a 5.0 liter V8) that stock pumps out 195 HP and 203 LBs of torque. Combine that rev happy engine with its full time all wheel drive system that sends 50% power to the front and 50% to the rear(drives great in snow and rain too)and that car really books. With power four wheel disc brakes it stops on a dime. My 5.0 was still faster. That was when his was stock.
Just last month he gave it a little exhuast system, K&amp;N intake, and a boost controller(just turn the screw and power goes up). With these few mods that only cost like $600, his car ran a 13.5 quarter.  That is really fast. My barely modded 5.0 runs high 13's low 14's. Put it this way, his $5,600, good looking car runs a 13.5 quarter. A new $28,000 Cobra Mustang runs a 14.2 quarter, a new $50,000 Vette runs a 13.3 quarter, and a $75,000 Viper GTS runs a 12.5 quarter.  
Now about the car. Power everything, leather, tiny back seats, but its not a family car, right? It drives good, a little rough due to its low profile tires and sporting suspension. What else can I say besides &quot;Bang for the Buck&quot;.
