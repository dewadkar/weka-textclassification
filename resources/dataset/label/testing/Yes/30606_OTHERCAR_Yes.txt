            We bought our car from my in - laws a few years ago. Now we are the proud owners of a white, manual, 4 door SL1 Saturn complete with tape deck/ stereo. I would not live without my dependable Saturn who takes me wherever I want to go.  With proper maintenance, my car has never required any major expenses. (Other than the usual, you know once the car hits 140,000 plus...well, it needs a few things replaced here and there.)
My car is comfortable, easy to manage, easy to care for and VERY RELIABLE! This is important as when I am on a trip, I do not want to worry about my car breaking down.

Another aspect of owning a Saturn that I really enjoy is the service at the Saturn dealerships/ Maintenance. When I take my car in for an oil change, or tune up, I enjoy the assurance that all of my car's information is already on the computer. This makes it easier and more convenient to take the car in for servicing. The hassle free, worry free ease with which I manage to maintain my Saturn is worth seeking out a Saturn dealer.

The only con I have found with owning a Saturn: When living in or traveling through rural areas, be aware that there are car shops who may not carry Saturn parts in their shops.  We found this problem in Northern Kentucky. No one had a part we needed and we had to search out the missing part in action.  Overall, the joy and ease with which I own, use, and maintain my Saturn is worth its weight in gold! My next car purchase will also be a Saturn!!! I am sold!<br><br>
