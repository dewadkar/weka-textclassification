            A few years ago my family decided to buy a Sport utility vehicle. Why they came across the Toyota 4-runner I have no idea.  All I know is that we have had it now for about 8 years and it has been a great car.  The runner has almost 100,000 miles on it and keeps on going.  I believe that the only things that have really gone wrong on it was the normal day to day things, such as brakes, tires, windshield wipers, etc.  This car started out as my dads vehicle then went to my brother and now that he lives out of town I get the pleasure of driving the hog around.  There is a lot of advantages to the 4 runner such as the style and comfort, but as far as the room goes it kind of lacks in that area.  It could be more spacious, but since it is usually just me and my friends in it it's a fun car to drive.  The only thing I do wish is that it was an automatic instead of a stick.  This vehicle is so much fun to drive, but kind of lacks on the power.  If I was to get a new one I would not necessarily need the 4X4 again since I don't use it.  In my opinion this is a great car for anyone to buy, but they are getting on the pricey side now and it is hard to just go out and buy one with less than 30 grand.
