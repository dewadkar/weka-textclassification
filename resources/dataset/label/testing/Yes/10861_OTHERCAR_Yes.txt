                 Last spring my husband and I had to go home on emergency leave. We drove the 18 hours to our hometown in our little Ford Escort. Mind you, the Escort is a nice little car, but that was becoming our problem, it was getting to be too small. with two kids, a dog that always travels with us, and ourselves, we decided we might need to check into upgrading to a larger vehicle. We discussed the pros and cons of buying a larger vehicle, the Pros being a larger, more comfortable ride, and the Cons being a larger vehicle payment. We decided to take our chances and see what was out there. We test drove several SUV's, coming upon the Pathfinder at the last dealership we went to. We instantly fell in love with it.

     What we love about the Pathfinder is the amount of room we now have. Normally on a long trip, we each would have a bag or something stuffed under our feet, but not since we bought this SUV! We all ride very comfortably with alot of room now. The true test came when we traveled home for Christmas, we didn't have to ship anything back! We were able to carry everything home with us. Another thing we both love about it is the sporty look and feel of the truck. My husband particularly loves the 4 wheel drive, the leg room, and the stereo sytem and speakers.

     What we don't like so much (but are willing to put up with) is the gas mileage and the fact that the tires are a bit expensive to replace.

     The Pathfinder drives very smooth and I love that I don't feel like I am driving and parking a bus.

     I would recommend this SUV to anyone who is looking to go to a larger vehicle.<br><br>
