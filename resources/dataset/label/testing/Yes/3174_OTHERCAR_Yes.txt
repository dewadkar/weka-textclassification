            The Chevy Camaro &quot;The Ultimate Driving Experience&quot;  If you are looking for a Fast, &quot;Sports Car&quot; that's fun to drive and looks great, the Camaro is the car.  I've had my Camaro since 95, and have logged close to 100,000 miles in this car, with no problems what so ever, besides general maintenance and one new set of tires.  It's a Standard V-6, with a lot of pick up, and handles &quot;like it's on rails&quot;.  I've driven the car over 20 hours straight driving from Florida to Oklahoma, it ran like a champ, and was a comfortable driving experience.  There's not tremendous room in the back, but as for the front seats, there is plenty of leg room.  This car handles  the road, much better than any Taurus, Grand Prix, Grand Am, Camry, or Buick Regal, and I list those only because those are the only cars I have it to compare to.    

I bought the Camaro, because I knew I would be on the road a lot, and spending time in the car, so I wanted something fun to drive and something that would be comfortable for me to drive.  I wouldn't recommend this car to large people, because the seats are small, and a big man has a hard time fitting into the front seats, but as for everyone else it's great.  It is a bit difficult to see the front of the car, but you get used to it, and make concessions for that.  It truly is the Ultimate Driving Experience and priced right.<br><br>
