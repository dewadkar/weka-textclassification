            Ahh, drop drooling over the car! You must resist the urge. It costs way too much now, just wait till 150k of them are shipped next year. The PT Cruiser is the first real challenge the Beetle gets since its rebirth, as its even more funky than the VW, and I actually think its a better car. First of all, the Cruiser is hardly a small car like the Beetle. Its not a big one either; however, the fact that you can fold down all the seats except for drivers gets it the categorization of being a truck. Yeah, not as big as the ones you are used to, but this thing is indeed a truck. But no, some will say its just a van, and others will claim is a sedan. I tell you what; PT Cruiser is a hybrid, a car that should be given its own category.

First of all, its looks will completely shock you. The PT styling is completely retro, except for the fact that it�s body is quite round. The older cars had sharper edges, yet one could say that the PT is a retro car under the influence of decent aerodynamics. Its wheel covers are wide and thick, and it also sports a large grill (taken from the Prowler). The front looks sort of like a truck, but the back comes down as in a wagon. Overall, the car looks like something we are not used to seeing, and yet strangely familiar.

The PT shares some parts with the Neon, but its built on a completely different platform. It's engine (I think the same as the one on Chrysler Cirrus) is a 4cyl 2.4liter that can punch 150HP. Not quite fast, but this is hardly a racer. It�s merely a cruiser, as the name blatantly outputs. The fact that its also considered a 'truck' makes it one of the most fuel efficient trucks around; we are talking about 20 city and 26 highway. 

However, that is not to say the PT is not a fun to drive car. As a matter of fact, just sitting at the front seats will make you giggle in delight. You get the same funky feeling in the Beetle, but the PT's seats are placed a lot higher. You almost get the feeling of driving an SUV, with the high top and a great view of the road all around. The interior is filled with a lot of mumbo jumbo, but suffice it to say that almost everything inside has been built with the thought that it all needs to be folded. The cargo space of the PT is amazing.

With the Prowler costing an eye and a leg (without deserving it in my humble opinion) one would think the PT also has insane rates. After all, it�s a truck, isn't it? Welp, be ready to get spooked, because all 3 models of the PT cost somewhere between 15k to 20k. Small amount to pay for a car this good if you ask me. Nevertheless, because of the over enthusiasm that this car gets, the invoice price is being pumped up. Honda S2000 suffers the same problem, but the PT will be shipped in great amounts come next year. At this point, the price will become reasonable...well, more like dirt-cheap. So just bid your time, and get this car if you also think its kewl.
