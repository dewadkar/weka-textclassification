            I bought this vehicle (2000 EX) because its supposed to be the best there is on the market. I bought the EX, with the dual power doors, for that reason alone. It appears that Honda has worked out the kinks- the auto-reverse feature works as advertised, although the salesman looked might terrified when I stuck my hand in the door to test this. 

I was able to find a dealer that had this model on the lot (several in fact), although I had to travel 60 miles to pick it up. A small price. If you are looking for one and don't want to wait, try printing out a list of dealers and calling. My success rate was approximately 2 out of 20 (I looked only for the EX without regard to color).
