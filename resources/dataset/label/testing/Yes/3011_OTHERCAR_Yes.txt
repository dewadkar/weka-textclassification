            I own a 1994 Geo Metro Hatchback.  I bought it used in 1997 with 50,300 miles on it.  Since then I've put nearly 100,000 miles on it, using it to commute to and from school (an hour drive each way) and fellowships and work.  Needless to say, I've spent a lot of time in this car.  I picked the Geo because of price, and also because of gas mileage.  I knew that it was supposed to get excellent gas mileage, and after nearly 3 years of driving it, I can attest to that.  I average at least 40mpg, and have seen 44mpg at the best.  I've found the Geo to be comfortable for the driver, and as I have back problems, this is saying a lot.  My model came with Air Conditioning, and it works excellently, in fact you can't run it at full blast constantly, even on really hot days, because it will freeze you out of the car.  That does bring up one minor problem.  While the Geo has a temperature slider gauge, in practice it has only three temperature settings: cold, nothing, and hot.  In the Winter I frequently have to turn the temperature up and down as I cannot find the ideal temperature.  I've learned to live with this though, and consider it minor with all the gas mileage I get.  Driving and handling of the Geo are very nice, I never feel I am out of control.  While some might be put off by the manual steering and manual transmission, I actually enjoy them, as they make me feel more in control.  Parallel parking can be a problem though, as it is difficult to turn the wheel sharply while sitting still.  I would recommend a Geo Metro to anyone who has a lot of commuting to do.  The gas mileage it gets is incredible, and with gas prices currently being so high, you'll definitely appreciate having to go to the pumps less.<br><br>
