            I recently test drove a 2003 Honda Accord Coupe with a V6 and 6 speed manual transmission.  

EXTERIOR
Looks are so subjective, so I will only comment briefly this part.
I like the coupe design much better than the sedan.  It has long, smooth lines which makes it look aerodynamic and sporty.  My tester had 17 inch wheels which helped the overall look of the car.  The back end of the car is ok, but I still like the overall look of the 1998-2002 model better.

INTERIOR
This is an area that Honda as improved on.  First of all, the upgraded the gauges to an electro-luminisent display like the kind on all Lexus models.  Secondly, the interior quality is vastly improved.  Everything is feels good to the touch.  

PERFORMANCE/RIDE
This is where the Accord really shined.  My tester came equipped with Honda's all new, 240hp V6.  When mated to the 6 speed tranny, this car can really fly.  0-60 is right around 6.3 seconds, which is very fast for this type of mainstream car.  Their is a fair amount of torque steer, which is common in front-wheel drive cars with this much power.  And the ride was firm, which helped with the handling, but you give up some smoothness.

VALUE
Hondas have been known for their outstanding reliability and resale value.  My particular car was fairly pricey, stickering around 28k.  But considering the Accord coupe could easily run with a BMW 330i coupe that costs almost 15k more, I would consider the accord to be a good value.
