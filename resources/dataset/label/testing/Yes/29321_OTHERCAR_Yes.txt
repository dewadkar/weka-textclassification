            Last summer we visited a Chevy dealer to look for a new car for my wife.  We were primarily interested in the Malibu, but while searching the lot, we came across a couple of Trackers.  My wife immediately fell in love with it!  But being the thorough, methodical person that I am, I wanted to  do some research first.  I found &quot;edmunds.com&quot; to be an excellent source of automotive information (maybe they'd be a good candidate for another review), and through their site I learned that the Tracker was a well-built, highly-rated vehicle.  I then used the &quot;gmbuypower.com&quot; site to investigate the stock of local dealers with the particular options we desired.  The buypower site led us to a good local dealer that was eager to work with us, and they located a vehicle that met our configuration requirements.  After a quick test drive, we closed the deal and my wife became the proud owner of a Tracker.  With two small dogs, and a small child, the Tracker is the perfect size for our family.  Not only is it more than adequate for our local excursions to Home Depot and Costco, but it has served us quite well on a couple of long trips.  It has a luggage rack on top, and we may invest in a carrier for the top at some point, but the interior passenger/cargo space was sufficient for two adults, two dogs, a baby, and a load of Christmas gifts and luggage last month. 

You can certainly spend a lot more for an SUV.  But for our needs, the Tracker fits the bill.   <br><br>
