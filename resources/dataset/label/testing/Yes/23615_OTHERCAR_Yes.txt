            I personally haven't experienced too many of the new wave SUV's that have been flooding the market the last few years.  But this is mainly due to the fact that I have no reason for a massive Sport Utility Vehicle.  See, it's all in the title.  I do not drive my car for sport, nor do I really need a car with tons of room for cargo and passengers.  I am a single guy who just needs to get to school and work.  A Ford Excursion would only bring me misery, as I already have a hard time finding decent parking without taking into consideration the size of my vehicle.

In my mind, I think SUV's are a good idea, and they serve some families and companies well.  Personally, I have always been fond of the <b>Jeep Cherokee</b>.  It has room for cargo, passengers, and its rear won't stick out of the parking spot.  I have always liked the look of Cherokees, and when my brother bought his 1996 Cherokee well, in 96, I can tell you I talked him into driving that thing a few times.  I loved the handling, as well as the comfort of the ride and interior.

The seats were very comfortable, and when my brother and I took a 15 hour road trip in it, I never got too cramped or uncomfortable.  There was plenty of leg room in the front, without sacrificing leg room for the back seat.  Very spacious.

Getting back to me driving it, how I love to do that.  This vehicle handles very nicely on turns as well as your standard driving operations.  It felt like it was firmly gripping the pavement, and it had a wide wheel base.  The turning radius was surprisingly close, which I guess explains the tight turning.

Though this 96 Cherokee doesn't have 4 wheel drive, it still operates under strenuous conditions very nicely.  Driving from Southern Indiana to Washington D.C., you are gonna encounter some highly varying terrain ie. mountains, gravel on the road, any combination of weather hazards...
Amazingly, the ride was extremely smooth, and the truck acted as if it was merely driving down the street to the grocery store.  Even under those conditions, had an accident or something happened, there were driver and passenger side airbags.  I felt safe no matter what in that truck.

For a SUV, this Jeep gets great gas mileage.  That greatly helps during these crazy fluctuating gas prices.  I'd say about 26-30 miles/gal. on the highway, and about 20 m/g in town.  Not too bad considering some SUV owners had to take on 2 jobs to afford gas prices recently.

In today's vehicle market, you can find an SUV by every major automobile company in every shape, size, and color.  But for me, the <b>Jeep Cherokee</b> is still the best deal.  At only about $18,000, it won't break you like a Navigator will.  And like I said there is room to spare, and it's a safe, gass efficient vehicle.  Though I am speaking of a 1996 model, the Cherokee has only gotten better with time.  I know a couple of people who own a 1999 and 2000 model Cherokee, but I haven't driven those yet.  Maybe another review someday.  Anyway, if you are in the market for a new SUV or just tired of your minivan, check out your local Jeep dealer.  You'll be surprised at how great of a deal this vehicle will be.  Plus, you'll have some leftover money for a family road trip in the end!
