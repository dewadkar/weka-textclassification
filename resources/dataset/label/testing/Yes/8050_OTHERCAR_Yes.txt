            Back in October of 1998 I visited the San Francisco Ferrari showroom in Marin intent on acquiring the 550 Maranello.  I had read so much about this car and having run two other Ferrari's in the last 5 years, I was
convinced that this would be the ultimate experience.   As it turned out,
after receiving a thorough presentation on the car I still had to wait
11 months before I could take delivery.   Nevertheless, after the exciting presentation I decided within 15 minutes to order the 550.
Fortunately, life at internet speed races by, though I thought I'd never see the day when I'd take delivery of the 550.   Then in September of 1999, I received a call from the dealer that the car had arrived and
it would be ready for delivery within 3 days.  

That balmy Saturday morning, after the salesman gave me a rather lengthy 
overview of the car, my wife and I jumped into the Rosso Corsa Stallion and I have never been the same since.  We drove it up to Mount Tamalpais, before the weekend crowd arrived and it was the most memorable trip I'd ever taken up there.  First of all, I just fell in love with how the car sounds with its deep growl like that of a lion calling his mate in the wild.  As we glided up the curves to Mount Tam I could hear the engine
echoing with such sultry allure, I'd almost wish I was behind the car to listen to it more closely.  I liken the 550 to a Roman chariot of fire, because of your sitting position as a driver or passenger for that matter.  With the high door line on each side, it feels like your gliding on velvet no matter what speed your at, and what adds to that &quot;chariot aura&quot; are the squeaky brakes on the thing, the brakes grab, but a special compound is added to them, which while causing the brakes to squeak quite audibly, makes for optimal deceleration of the 550 at high speeds.  

Gear shifting is actually the smoothest and precise I've experienced of any of the Ferrari's I've run.  The clutch pedal is easy on the left leg
and not too demanding.  When I finally had an opportunity to open up acceleration on highway 101 from the Tiburon Boulevard entrance headed
South, I felt like I was going to black out the g's were so intense!  I felt as if I were entering another time zone.  I tell you this car is a mad beast of acceleration and I feel, in first gear hitting 50 miles per hour with the pedal half way down, like I'm being catapulted into another time dimension.  I've never experienced this phenomenon before in driving a car, and its scary.   While the 550 has the most precise steering I'd ever felt on a sports car and an extremely rigid frame, you almost immediately gain this sense of foreboding respect for her.  Foreboding in that you don't want to be tempted to take this car to its outer limits, for in all likelihood, you'll reach yours way before she does.  Hey, my reflexes aren't what they used to be.

There isn't much too hate about the 550, except the squeaky brakes.   I think the interior could have been more exciting, but Ferrari interiors (the leather, appearance of switches, gauges, etc)never fail to give you that functionality over aesthetics impression.  I wish that the car had a sun roof from the factory for the sake of maintaining its structural integrity, I'd never dream of having one installed retrofit, though it'd be the perfect finishing touch, to get some sun rays through the roof of this car. 

I now have 8 thousand miles on the 550 and I relish everyone that I add to the odometer.  Anyone looking to run a Ferrari knows that you have to be both financially and emotionally committed to the darn thing.  Financially committed to keep her in good health and emotionally committed when you begin to rationalize occasionally where else you could have &quot;invested&quot;.  But at the end of life, we won't be able to take it with us, so we may as well enjoy life and these cars whose splendor and
ingenuity is absolutely unmatched.
