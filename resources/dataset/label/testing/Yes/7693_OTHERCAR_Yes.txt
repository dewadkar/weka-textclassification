            <b>W</b>e bought our 2-door 4-wheel drive <b>1999 Chevy Tahoe</b> new in July of 1999.  It currently has 15,000 miles on it.  If you are researching for a used sport utility vehicle, I am sure you are wanting to find out about the reliability, repairs, gas mileage, and what you can expect for overall performance from buying a used <b>1999 Chevy Tahoe</b>.   

<b>The Chevy Tahoe</b> was formally called the Chevy Blazer, however, there were two versions of the Chevy Blazer, more commonly referred to as the "Big Chevy Blazer" and the "Little Chevy Blazer" or the "S10 Chevy Blazer".   We traded in our "Big 1994 Chevy Blazer" for the Tahoe.  1999 was the last year that Chevrolet made the 2-door model of the Chevy Tahoe.

<b>Performance</b>

<b>T</b>he <b>1999 Chevy Tahoe</b> drives and rides smoother than a car.  The Tahoe is the preferred SUV for my husband in our family of SUV's due to the roominess and the ever so cushiony ride.  The turning radius is excellent in this vehicle, which makes it very easy to park, back-up and make u-turns. There are no blind spots in this vehicle. 

<b>T</b>he Tahoe's engine tows with no effort a 20 foot boat, yanks our other SUV's out of snow banked ditches like it was nothing and climbs steep terrain with effortless ease.   Off road driving, the <b>1999 Chevy Tahoe</b> just glides over bumps and potholes with its cushiony suspension.   The steering is tight and it handles curvy roads easily and has never tried to tip over.

<b>I</b>n the winter, our Tahoe gets equipped with our snowplow and chains and is only used to plow our 1 mile long driveway which is why our mileage is so low on it.

<b>T</b>he Tahoe uses regular unleaded fuel and averages about 16 mpg in city driving and about 19 mpg on the highway.

<b>Repairs</b>

<b>A</b>bsolutely nothing has had to be repaired on this vehicle.

<b>Final Impression</b>

<b>O</b>ur family really loves our Tahoe, especially my spoiled husband, for its comfort for long trips, the all around viewing area for all passengers, and its cushiony rides on off roads.   The rear seat folds down to make a large cargo area.  We have never regretted buying this vehicle.
