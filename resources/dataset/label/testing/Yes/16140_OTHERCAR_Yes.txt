            I think that The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a fantastic SUV.  It has a appealing look and yet a very comfortable interior.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee is probably the only car I will ever own.  I have love jeeps since I was a kid and as i grew up the Jeeps started to change.  The jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the top selling Jeeps out their on the market today and we all know why that is.  Its because its such a nice car.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee unlike other cars isn't that much of a gass guzzler.  It has good gas mileage which is something that is surprising to hear from a SUV.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee is also a luxurious car as well.  Some of the features that makes it so luxurious is that it come in different colors of attractive, comfortable leather and it has different types of luxurious interior for the dashboard.  I think if you buy the Jeep Grand Cherokee you are making a good choice and I promise you wont regret it.<br><br>
