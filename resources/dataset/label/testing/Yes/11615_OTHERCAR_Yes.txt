              We were out looking at Saturns and thought we had found exactly what we wanted.  The salesman said it would be 6 weeks before it would be in and the Mrs did not want to wait.  We strolled across the street to the Nissan dealer and looked around.  Not having much money, we shopped the 92 models hoping to get a better deal.  They only had 2 left and we set our minds on getting the 4 door easing access to the rear seat.  After the prerequisite  wheeling and dealing with the salesman, we took home our new &quot;little&quot; car.
  That was Oct 92 and today the car is in the hands of our 17 year old.  The front-wheel drive gives her more control in bad weather than the conventional rear-wheel drive.  The driver's seat gives ample room to those under 6'.  After that you get to be too cramped to sit comfortably. Gas mileage is about average for vehicles in its class.  With normal user
maintenance, the Sentra can go on for many, many years.  With the exception of some suspension and body work after an accident, we have only had to replace the normal items...tires, batteries, etc.  
  It is a perfect first car for a teen or a good family car for those who cannot afford to have a large car payment.  If you are tall, over 6', you will not have enough room to fit comfortably.  Also, if you are a very large person you will find the fit to be snug.  The car has sufficient power to haul 4 people around but is not practical for hauling anything else.<br><br>
