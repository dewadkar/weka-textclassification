            If you are looking for a reliable vehicle, you can't go wrong buying a Mitsubishi. Mine has 130,000 miles on it and has only had to have the thermostat replaced. I like knowing that I can go out and start up my car and depend on it to get me where I need to go. I love the sporty look, the good gas mileage, and the handling of the car. One thing I could have done without was the factory alarm. It malfunctioned right after I got the car, but I had it taken out and didn't have any further problems.

Driving this vehicle for me is almost like sitting on the ground because it is so low. Some people prefer to sit up high, but being as I am only 5'2&quot;, I don't like &quot;climbing a ladder&quot; to get into my car. I recommend this vehicle to teenagers and young adults. I also recommend this car to anyone who likes a sporty look and likes to accelerate fast. As I said before mine is very reliable and My next vehicle will probably be a new Eclipse.<br><br>
