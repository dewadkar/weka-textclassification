            My blue 1996 Nissan Altima is my first car.  Granted I was driving other cars for about a year, this is the first car that I am paying for and can don't have to ask anyone to borrow, and I am very happy with my decision.  The car is very roomy, and there are a lot of accessories.  The car only has four cylinders, but you couldn't tell by driving it.  It has a lot of pick up for a four cylinder car.  It has power locks and windows.  It has cruise control, and the back seat is tremendous.  We have fit five adults comfortably in my car on a number of occasions.  There is plenty of leg room.  The trunk is also very big.  I'm sure we could fit two people in it!  The car beeps if you have left your keys in the ignition, or if you have left your lights on after you turn off the car.<br>     I have had this car for a year now and have only brought it to the mechanic for oil changes.  I have absolutely no complaints about my car.  It's definitely affordable, since I'm a college student paying for it with my part time job.  I am very pleased with my first car.  My mother also loves the car.  She drives it on occasion, and that just proves that this doesn't have to be a teenager's vehicle.  Nissan has definitely done a good job with this car.<br><br><br>
