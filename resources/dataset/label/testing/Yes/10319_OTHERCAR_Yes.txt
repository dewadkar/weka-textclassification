            I bought a new 1995 Nissan Altima and drove it for 58,000 miles and never had to do more than routine maintenance. The only reason for selling it was to get a larger vehicle.  

I traded a 1985 Nissan Maxima for the 1995 Altima.  I had put 105,000 miles on the Maxima but didn't want to spend the difference between what a Maxima would cost and the Altima.  I had reservations about going to the Altima, but they proved to be unfounded.  I got excellent gas mileage and it handled great.  The one thing that I did not like about the Altima was the fact that the brakes squeaked almost from day one.  I kept taking it back and was essentially told I would have to live with it and I did.

The car was very comfortable inside and had all the extras including keyless entry.

Except for wanting a bigger, heaver vehicle, I would still be driving the 1995 Altima.<br><br>
