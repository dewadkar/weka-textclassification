            I saw the other reviews and have to disagree that this is a bland car.  I have a white 95' LSI and I think she looks good.  I have the small 1.6L engine and an automatic.  My former cars were a acura integra GSR, and a honda CRX, so I have an idea on performance.  The prizm performs great, and I have never gotten a ticken in her.  The handling is comparable to the integra and the CRX, its very responsive.  As for room I do not recommend it for 4 adults.  My wife has a van and I have the prizm, and we use the prism when we are driving the kids as much as we do the van.  Putting two car seats in the back is absolutly no problem.


Things I did to mine at 100K and recommend:

Timing belt, including tensioner, and there is a 1.50 spring that keeps the tension.  REPLACE IT!

Dist cap, rotor, plugs, wires.

Get the Transmission a T-Tech service.  This is a complete transmission flush

adjust the valves

buy a K and N air filter, they are only 30 bucks and are guar. for 1,000,000 miles, this really helped performance.

This has been a wonderful car.  I have also driven the base model, and they are chincy.  Get the LSI if you can.  Also make sure you get the 4-spd trans.  the 3 speed is really busy at 70 mph.
