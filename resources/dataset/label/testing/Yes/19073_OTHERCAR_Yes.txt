            after much research  (a lot on epinions) and seeing the AMAZING pictures on my friends camera...i decided to plunk down and buy this one (my first digital).  i was so excited to take pictures at my friends birthday party and read the manual on the flight there...and to my utter dismay and disappointment - i found on page 156 that though the camera is Mac and PC compatible - it won't work with the iMac, which is what i have.

color me bummed.

reading through the manual though - it looks like a great camera - has all sorts of special functions that don't seem too difficult to learn.  

but again, i must stress that what cinched my decision to buy this camera was the incredible quality of the pictures (on screen).  i thought i had died and come back a professional photographer (i took the first batch of pictures).

if you don't have an iMac - i'd say go for this one!  (i hear the adapter is well worth the cost as well as additional rechargeable batteries - especially if you're travelling.<br><br>
