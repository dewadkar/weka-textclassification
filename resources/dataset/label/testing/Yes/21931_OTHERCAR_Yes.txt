            I have had three previous 540i, this is my 4th 540i (and 4th BMW).  I needed a car that can accomodate my 3 dogs (little ones), and possibly kids down the road.  I also wanted a car that can fit 4 sets of golf clubs, and still go pretty fast, and this is really the only thing in this part of the world that will do the job.  And the steptronic trans. just add to the fun (it is a little sluggish, and the throws are a little long, but it is the best auto-manual I have driven)

The only things I didn't like are
1.  Even as a wagon, the hauling capacity is still small.  I would have hoped for just a bit more space.

2.  The high price - I got a great deal on the car, and paid 500 below factory invoice (to dealer), plus a BMW CCA member loyalty rebate of 1500 (I am on my 4th BMW, I figure I deserve it!), but I still paid 57k+ including tax... ouch.<br><br>
