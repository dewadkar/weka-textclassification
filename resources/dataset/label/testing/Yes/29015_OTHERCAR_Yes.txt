            I just recently purchased a 2001 model year Honda CR-V.  Since there isn't a category available for this car yet, and there doesn't seem to be any significant changes over the 2000 model year vehicle, I thought I would review it here.

After driving the vehicle for a couple of weeks, I feel I can recommend this car to practically anybody.  It's a pleasure to drive, with a comfortable suspension that is neither too mushy or too firm.  The car handles nicely for a vehicle of its type, and it came equipped with a suite of standard features that one would expect to find on a luxury class vehicle in a much higher price range.  The construction of the vehicle seems very solid, parts fit smoothly and attractively, and it feels solid when driven.  As of this writing no items, major or minor, have failed to operate on the vehicle.

One thing that impressed me about the Honda CR-V was the generosity of conveniences built into the vehicle.  Numerous compartments hold change, maps, drinks and the little odds and ends that tend to collect in your car.  Compartments in the rear can hold jumper cables, fire extinguisher, etc.  Instrumentation is accessible and easy to understand.  The ignition switch lights up momentarily when you get in so you can insert the key easily, and the dome light comes on when you turn off the car before you open the door.

I was also impressed with the quality of the stock sound system.  Front and rear speakers provide a car full of rich, quality audio from the in- dash radio. (cassette or CD are available) Controls for bass, treble, balance and front to rear fader push into the face plate when not in use.  The radio gets good reception and the system can be turned up fairly loud with no appreciable distortion.

Finally, I would like to mention how the Honda CR-V can adapt to a variety of lifestyles.  The rear seats fold down (with a very smart place to stow the head restraint) to create extra cargo space when needed.  The four passenger doors provide convenient access to the vehicle, and the rear cargo door is easy to operate, and swings out without having to move the rear mounted spare tire.  The driver's seat is adjustable, and both front seats recline.  The steering wheel can be adjusted over a small range of vertical positions.  These features, combined with the Honda reputation for quality and value add up to car that should be looked at by anybody in the market for a small SUV.
