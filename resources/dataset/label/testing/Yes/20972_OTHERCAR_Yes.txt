            First, let me say I love this vehicle!  It's big and strong, sturdy over back roads and smooth on highways.  We traded a GMC 1500 oversized pickup for this used Suburban, wishing for a better ride on long trips.  We've been very pleased.

The Suburban carries 8 adults comfortably, which is a feat in itself.  Not only that, those 8 adults can bring an overnight bag and coolers as well.  Add to that the requisite boat and trailer, and you've got a very handy vehicle.   One you can take to the beach for surf-fishing!

We've had a couple of minor defects to contend with, such as a broken belt and a cargo bin that doesn't latch.  Otherwise, we've no complaints -just general maintenance.  There are bins and cupholders everywhere, necessary when hauling those 8 comfy adults.  It's built on the same chassis as the GMC 1500 pickup, so there is the same dash configuration.  The air conditioning vents an incapable of aiming directly at the driver, and my love for my cool air has me occasionally complaining about that.  The cooling system works well, though, and the temperature inside the vehicle quickly gets comfortable.  The heater is the same - quick.  The additional controls for the rear area of the passenger compartment are really handy as well.  That was good, when hubby had to come out and tow my Grand Prix during a bad snow...which the Suburban did with panache!

The stereo can't overcome that fact that we're in a truck, but it's surprisingly better than most.  It is quite adjustable.  The AM/FM Cassette is fully functional and delivers good, if not stellar, sound.

I'd recommend the Suburban to anyone who needs the 4-wheel drive and the capacity.  As long as you can park it, anyway.  It rides so well, you'll hardly notice you're in an SUV! <br><br>
