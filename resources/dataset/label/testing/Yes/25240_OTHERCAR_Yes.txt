            I purchased this car (a 1990 Celica GT Coupe) after getting rid of an Accord that made my life miserable.  I expected to have similar problems with this car, considering I have been known to drive my cars VERY hard.  Heck, I blew the transmission on the Accord, and I also blew the transmission and broke two engine mounts on my 91 Taurus.  Well, I was wrong about this car.  I've driven the car mercilessly, and it has never failed me.  I change the oil ever 2000 miles, and it runs just as well now as it did when I purchased the car.
When I bought the car, it had 57,000 miles on it.  That was back in 98.  Since then I have put another 50,000 miles on it, and all it has really needed is routine maintenance.  
Sure, I've had a few problems, but nothing compared to other cars I've driven.  The only major problem I've had was with the A/C compressor.  The compressor seized at the beginning of the summer, and was quite costly to replace.  I also had a bit of a problem with the alternator, but that was my own fault.  I've installed quite a few after market products to the car, of which included three very powerful amplifiers.  However, this problem was remedied with an after market alternator and a capacitor.  Since those were installed I have had no problems with the car at all.
The trunk space is good, good enough that I was able to install two very large ten inch band pass sub woofers, and I still have space available.  There is a full sized spare in the trunk.  
The back seat is cramped, but once I was able to fit THREE full sized adults (quite tightly) in the back, and two people (myself included) in the front.  
To put it mildly, the car is fast.  Very fast.  As I've mentioned, I have installed after market equipment to the car, a new exhaust, air intake, and some other speed enhancing products, but even before this, the car had nice pickup.  All the equipment I've installed was readily available and reasonably priced.  It isn't too difficult to find performance and cosmetic enhancing equipment to make this car more unique and distinct.
The interior ergonomics of the car leave a bit to be desired.  The dashboard is a little cluttered, and it is impossible to use the cup holders, cigarette lighter and ashtray at the same time.  It is also very difficult to fit large cups into the cup holders.  
The drivers seat is the most comfortable seat in the car.  It is adjustable, and has side and lower lumbar support.  I've taken very long road trips in the car.  One such trip was a 14 hour drive, and I was only forced to get out and stretch once.
The car is very quiet, so quiet there were times that I had thought the car stalled because the engine was idling so quietly.  There is virtually no outside noise while driving.  The car hugs the road perfectly.  I have never felt the car slip, and it responds amazingly well.  It takes tight turns at high speeds without a problem, and without the tires squealing.  It handles just as well at 20 as it does at 60, 70 or even over 100 miles per hour.
I have driven other sports cars and sports coupes, and to be perfectly honest, I feel safer in the Celica than the others.  I was involved in an accident over the summer.  It wasn't a fast collision, about 15 miles per hour, and it barely did any damage to the car (the accident was with a much larger car).  I was able to drive off with nothing more than a cracked bumper, a cracked tail lens, and no bodily injury.
As for reliability, there is no comparison.  The car has over 100,000 miles on it, and drives perfectly.  No rattles, no unwanted engine noise, no shaking.  I have heard stories of Celicas running smoothly well over 200,000 miles, and I can believe it.
I love my Celica so much that I went out and bought another Celica, a 92 Convertible.  The 90 Celica GT is a good car for anyone, whether they want a fun toy or reliable transportation.<br><br>
