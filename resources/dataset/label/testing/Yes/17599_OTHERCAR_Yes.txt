            The Dodge Neon is an excellent car for anybody's money. It is just small enough so you don't feel like your driving down the road in a tank and yet it is big enough so that you don't feel like your driving home from work in a tuna fish can. 

Feeling safe in car is one of the biggest things that I look for when purchasing a new car and if you are the same way then you'll feel good about at least checking out the Neon. The one that I drive is a black 1998 and it drives very smoothly. I got it without power doors or locks but that isn't a big deal for me. I've driven some cars that are so low to the ground I feel like I'm almost dragging my feet on the roadway but in this car I feel like I am sitting up more. 

If you're not into sporty little cars that weave in and out of traffic, then this car probably isn't for you. However, if you want a compact 4-door car that has plenty of trunk space and room in the back seat for normal sized people to sit, then I think you'll like the car.<br><br>
