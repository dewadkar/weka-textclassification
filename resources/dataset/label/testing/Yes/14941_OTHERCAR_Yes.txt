            I was not much of a photographer, but my Sony Mavica FD73
changed my life. Digital cameras are an excellent way to take,
share and store memories! Instead of a shoebox full of
crumbled and bent glossies, I now have a folder full of files! Not
only can I view the photos when I want, but I can email them to
friends and family. 

It is fast and fun and the best way to keep
friends updated on your activities. I have some friends who
regularly send baby photos via email and I always know how
the toddler is growing even though we live states away. I think
the best aspect of the digital camera is the instant processing.
You take a shot and can view it from the camera. No need to
wait for prints. If you didn't capture the scene you wanted, you
simply take the picture again. Plus, you can delete all of the
bad photos of yourself without anyone knowing!

It is so user friendly. The screen is easy to use and it is very
easy to tab from one menu to another. I prefer Sony because you
can instantly take the disk to your computer and email it to a friend
or print the image. No file conversions, no waiting. Quick and easy!
                                
Software comes with the camera. The new battery technology is
getting better and you can charge the battery to last for hours. You
will definitely wish to invest in a small camera bag.

I bought a refurbished camera from the manufacturer and have had no problems with my camera.  Buying a refurbished camera saved me a couple hundred bucks!
