            Back in September, when our used car gave out, we decided it was finally time to break down and stop paying for other people's junk. I went to Saturn's web site and picked out a car that we felt was very reasonable and reliable. 
 When we went to test drive it, we feel in love with it. 
 The sales people were very nice and not pushy. There is no haggling and they don't bother you. We got the car that I picked out on the web site and we were about to take it home in 2 days. 
 The salesman gave us a rental car, free of charge until ours came in and picked us when it came in. 
 When we needed maintance, they did it, including an oil change, free of charge and they did it while we waited. Yes, they do have jelly donuts and coffee in there waiting room and even a play area for the kids.
 Saturn really made our first time new car buying experience a very enjoyable one.
 The only down side would be the amount of junk mail that they send you. You get atleast one survey to fill out for them a month and alot of literature, however, I get alot of junk mail anyway because of all the sweeps that enter. <br><br>
