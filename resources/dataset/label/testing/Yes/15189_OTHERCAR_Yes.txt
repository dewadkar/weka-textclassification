            There are many reasons I purchased this car.  When I read that this car was the best car on both sides and front and back collisions at high speeds, this car really caught my attention.  The price was also great.  Toyota is one of the best built cars of the 1990's.  I love the car and I bought one.  It drives like a lexus.  It has a lexus engine with a Toyota Camry chasis.  I highly recommend this car to anyone with kids and to be safe.  It handles great in the snow.  I love this car.  If you are interested in a car do your self a favor, even if it cost 2000 dollars more feel safe and get your self a Sienna.  There is nothing that I hate about this vehicle.  This body style is a new type and it may look different to you but the inside makes up for it.<br><br>
