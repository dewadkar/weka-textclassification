            We bought a red 97 Cutlass Supreme SL used from a dealership in May of 2000.  When we first started it in the lot we heard some ticking.  We assumed it was just a sticky valve.  We felt we got a good deal on the car.  It had 54K miles and we got it for $9000.  As the months went on, the ticking got quite a bit louder.  We added valve cleaner to our engine thinking it would solve the problem.  It didn't.  We brought back to the dealership because the car was still under warranty until August.  They said it was the pistons making the noise.  They didn't want to fix it under warranty but we kept bothering them until they did.  The car was in the shop for 3 days.  We got all 6 pistons and rings replaced.  We found out that the cause was that there was a teflon square on the skirt of each piston that was worn off.  Other than this one problem, the car has been very satisfactory to us.  Their is surprising power, even though Oldsmobile did offer a 3.4 DOHC 215HP as an option in 95 and 96.  Also, the looks of the Cutlass Supreme are very nice in a 4 door and 2 door, with 16 inch rims being standard.  I would recommend this car to you.<br><br>
