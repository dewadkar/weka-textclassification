            I've used my 35mm camera for years. It always satisfied the need to capture those precious moments, especially since I'm not very trigger-happy when it comes to taking pictures. However, times change and I felt the occasion has arrived for me to step into the digital age. I researched and decided on the Canon Powershot S400 because it has 4 megapixels and 3x optical zoom. Not to mention that it looked pretty slick. I ordered mine from Electric Sam's online for about $350 in Nov of 2003.

The Good

To start, this camera is transforming me into a trigger- happy photographer. I don't really want to take professional looking pictures most of the time, so 4 megapixels is plenty for me when printing out 4x6 photos. And for shooting mostly people, 3x optical zoom is just enough. The automatic setting on this camera usually gets me wonderful clarity and colors.

But not every picture turns out perfect, and let's assume that it's the fault of the camera and not somebody making faces. For me, this is where the S400 really shines. As per my other reviews, I like simple, intuitive, and functional designs. The player function on this ELPH is so easy to use. Just move the toggle to the play, zoom in or zoom out with the same lever used when taking pictures, and the 4 soft buttons act as directional controls. There is even a thumbnail view! A quick review can tell me if I need to retake the picture. I can use the automatic settings again or switch to manual settings on the dial.

The manual settings will require some reading of the instructions, but it's mostly painless. You can adjust the exposure, ISO Speed, the effects such as sepia, and etc. There aren't an overwhelming amount of choices to confuse the mind. And once again, those 4 soft directional buttons are so easy to use. Taking great home pictures does not get much easier than this. 

The S400 also has movie and "panoramic" settings. When I played around with them, they were easy to figure out but not terribly useful to me. Good to have, but not necessary. As for uploading to the computer, a USB cable is included for a quick operation. Canon also provides plenty of software for photo editing. But honestly, the pics have turned out so great that the most I have to do is crop. There's also a direct print function in the camera, which is great if you have the proper printer.

Lastly, the Powershot S400 proves that size does not matter. Well, at least in this case, it's the opposite of conventional wisdom. It's not very light, but it's very small. So small that I had a hard time finding a small enough case for it. It's easy to carry around and whip out at all the right occasions, or the wrong occasions if you're so inclined. This camera has been such a pleasure to own for someone like me, someone who just wants to point and shoot lots of pictures.

The Bad

The worst thing about the S400 is that the battery has to be removed from the camera to be recharged. I don't even know why there's a little rubber strip on the battery cover if there's no way to recharge through it. Fortunately, the S400 doesn't need to be recharged that often, about once every 5 days with lots of LCD and flash use for me. The recharge time is about 2-3 hours. So this is just annoying and inconvenient, but not a deal-breaker for me.

A small camera is good. But a small LCD screen presents problems. It can be hard to look at and some of the details can be entirely invisible until the picture is viewed through the computer. I understand that these two traits have to go together, but be advised that if you have problems looking at small pictures, a bigger camera with a bigger LCD screen is the way to go.

One final gripe about Canon, not the S400. The included 32MB Compactflash Card is insufficient. For a family picnic, it'll do. But for long trips where downloading to computers are impossible, an user could be seriously in trouble. Especially since repeatedly taking pictures with this camera can be addicting because it's just so fun and easy.

The Ugly

Otherwise known as the truth. The Powershot S400 is not a cheap camera. Many other manufacturers sell cheaper cameras with comparable specs. But with the S400, you get what you pay for, a highly functional camera that looks good and comes with good software.

Sometimes, this ELPH will be insufficient for professional photographers or true enthusiasts because there is limited control over the settings. But in the past three months, whenever I wanted to take a quick pic on the mountain top when snowboarding, or snap a shot with my family, it performed perfectly. I am very happy with my choice.
