            This is the best car I have ever owned. It took awhile to take the plunge into minivan world but I'm so glad I did.

It is so easy to get my son in and out of.  The dual sliding doors is great.  The extra room in the grand voyager makes a huge difference.  I was so surprised how nice the ride is in one.  They aren't bumpy like SUVs usually are.  If i would have known now before i even had my son i would have bought one. 

The only con I have is gas mileage.  We travel a lot so it would be nice to get a lot more to the gallon.
