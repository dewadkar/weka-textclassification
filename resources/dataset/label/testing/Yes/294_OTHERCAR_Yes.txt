            Living in Michigan with the snowy/icy winters that we get, I was looking for a car or suv that would make the winter driving a little more barable.  I picked the Impreza Outback because of it competitive price, and also for all the good reviews I had read about their AWD system.  To say the least I am VERY impressed.  We just recently received about 6 inches of snow and it didn't even phase my outback.  I feel much safer driving in inclement weather now.  Not only is the AWD system great in the snow/ice, but the car handles great.  It corners excellent, stops promptly, and in the rain it grips the road, and when one wheel begins to slip, the others kick in...it's great!!!  The only complaint that I have is that I have experienced some rattles (mainly the right rear passenger seat belt banging against the plastic), and when 3 of the 4 doors are closed, you almost always have to close the 4th one twice because it won't close right the first time.  I believe this has to do with the tight seal around the doors (a good thing) and air pressure inside the car.  Otherwise this is the best car I have ever owned!!<br><br>
