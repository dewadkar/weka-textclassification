            I bought my 4Runner used over 2 years ago and I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I needed a bigger vehicle, so I sold my reliable Civic and went the SUV route.  I have had all the regular maintenance done on the 4Runner, and have had NO problems with it at all.  It is extremely reliable.

The interior is very basic, and the seating is not quite as roomy as one might expect when viewing the outside of the vehicle.  However, it will seat 5 average sized people comfortably.  Hey, it's a truck, not a luxury sedan.  The radio, climate controls, dash, wipers, lights, etc. are all easily found and operated.  You can even control the back window while driving, if desired.  The cargo area is excellent.  I have been able to transport 25" televisions, huge stacks of bricks, strollers and groceries, etc.etc. My one and only complaint about the interior is that the cupholders sit directly in front of the center air vents, and if there are drinks placed there, than it is nearly impossible to adjust the climate controls unless you have a great memory and remember which knobs adjust what (not to mention the air vents are blocked).  Driving a 4Runner makes you feel like you own the road, especially after being in a low-to-the-ground Honda Civic...  I feel very in control in my 4Runner, and my range of vision is great.

The truck drives very well, though even with a V6 and "power" button, it still is just a tad sluggish.  That's to be expected, though, with this size vehicle.  Also, don't expect it to handle tight like a regular sedan.  The center of gravity is quite high on this vehicle, so hugging the curves is a little more difficult, or maybe dangerous.

The exterior of the 4Runner is very stylish, not boxy at all, like some of the other SUV's, and not minivan-like at all, either.

The 4Runner can be a little expensive at retail, but I bought mine for a real deal and am 100% satisfied!  I plan to drive it til it "don't drive no more".
