            Having read most of the opinions, I decided to let folks know what I think after a year of owning an Xterra. I can sum up my experiences in one word "Great!"
I driven my Xterra over 15K miles through all sorts of weather from torrential downpours in Florida to a harsh New England winter noreaster. It has never let me down once. I drive a 100 highway miles roundtrip a day to work and my Xterra is always tearing up the road. I will agree it doesn't accelerate like a sports car, but I easily drive at speeds in access of 80 mph with no problems. It should be noted that I have a manual transmission so I'm not sure how much of a difference it is.
My chief complaint is my gas mileage. I average about 16 mpg so you can imagine my weekly gas bills. But other that that I have had no problems with it. I'm looking at some aftermarket mods to increase horsepower and better my gas mileage. Nissan did get smart however and is offering a 210 hp supercharged engine in the 2002 Xterra.
So I am very happy with me Xterra, I looked at several other SUVs before buying this and I have never once regretted my decision.
