            My husband is a car salesman.  Between us, we have test driven almost every make and model of cars available today.  Personally, we are fans of larger cars.  Something about a great big gas guzzler makes us feel safe and secure.  But Ford has finally created a teeny tiny, affordable, safe, reliable, beautiful car, which I would certainly consider buying if gas prices keep rising.

At first glance, the <b>Ford Focus</b> might not look so special.  Like the popular Contour, it is a mid-sized car that looks like it just popped off a huge assembly line.  But look closer.  It�s quite attractive, and most importantly, it is highly economical.

If you�re pinching pennies, the Ford Focus will run you just over 10 grand.  If you�re pinching pennies, BUT want top of the line, the loaded Focus will cost considerably <b>under</b> 20 grand.  The last Ford Focus my husband brought home was decked out with leather and a 6-disc CD player, air conditioning, and power galore.  The outstanding price? $17,000.  Can�t beat it, if you ask me!

If the sight of your gas bill makes you want to puke, consider this: The Ford Focus gets some of the best gas mileage in its class.  Yes, it�s small and lightweight, but it�s also been designed for maximum gas efficiency.  And if a smaller car scares you like it does me, there�s no need to worry.  This modern beauty is loaded with steel beam reinforcement, self-locking seatbelts, anti-lock brakes and airbags.  It�s been proven as a safe and reliable vehicle, perfect for small families and young executives alike.

Here�s what sets the Focus apart from the former Contour, the former Probe, and the former Escort:  It has taken the best of Ford�s 3 small cars and created an attractive, economical, safe, luxurious package for an incredibly low price.  I was never a fan of Ford�s small, economy class cars.  Personally, I didn�t think they were very chic, not even the sport models.  But this car looks good, and I�d feel proud to drive it around town.  Coming from a previous owner of a Dodge Stealth, that statement goes a long way.

The Ford Focus comes in 3 distinct models: sedan, wagon and hatch back.  All three models have a similar sporty, modern look.  The main difference among them is the amount of interior space.  The price difference is negligible.  So, pick a Focus that best fits your lifestyle, and take a test drive this weekend.  They all offer a smooth, easy ride with a good bit of horse power, and you�ll barely notice your gas needle move at all.

Most Ford Focus models come standard with power windows and locks, tilt power steering, and anti-lock brakes.  However, even the loaded-up, luxury model is missing power seat adjustment, which would probably drive me a little crazy at first.  My husband has snarled me at, though, for saying this.  He claims the dial-type seat adjuster is certainly top of the line and very innovative.  Not only can you move your seat forward and back with the flip of a switch, but you can also raise and lower the seat.  This is a new concept not usually found in manual seats.  According to my husband, Ford has outdone itself with this little invention.  For once, they are the leader of the pack.

In addition, the Ford Focus is not available with a factory-installed moon roof.  Because of the ergonomic, tilted roof, Ford will not install the moon roof, claiming it will not optimize the gas mileage of the car.  However, if you are a sun lover like me, you can have a standard moon roof installed by your favorite body shop.  This answer satisfies me.  My body shop guy is quite a trustworthy fellow, and he�s my brother.

I don�t own a Focus (yet), but I have driven quite a few of them.  This morning, my husband was telling me that my Uncle Gene stopped by the store last night to take a gander at the Focus.  This boggled my mind, since my Uncle Gene is a self-made millionaire and a very intelligent man, who currently drives an Explorer.  It seems that dear Uncle Gene is sick and tired of his ludicrous gas bill, and after a great deal of research, he decided that he�d be just as well-off in a Focus.  Well, I have to admit, this got my attention.

My husband and I both idolize Uncle Gene.  Do we respect him so much that we would replicate his decision to buy a smaller, more efficient, more affordable car?  My husband is certainly convinced.  Me?  Well, for now, I plan to run my great big Mercury Sable into the ground.  But until that day, I�ll just keep borrowing my husband�s demo.<br><br>
