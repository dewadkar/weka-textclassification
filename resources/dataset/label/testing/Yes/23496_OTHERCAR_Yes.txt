            You're on vacation. The kids are in tow, the amusement park is beckoning. The LAST thing you want is a bulky camera outfit with fifteen lenses to carry. Your prayers are now answered courtesy of Fuji Corporation.

The MX-700 has for all practical purposes performed like a champ for over a year of our family's &quot;testing.&quot; The unit was specifically purchased for its size, reported ease of use and the fact that it was a &quot;megapixel&quot; model. 

What is &quot;megapixel&quot;? It's really, really big pixels of course! (No, just kidding...that was a small joke. Ok, a small and bad joke!) Seriously, megapixel cameras have the capability to take pictures that you can print either at home or at your local film processor. Without getting technical, that is the result you get. 

The MX-700 was one of the first to have this capability, and definitely one of the smallest units you can own. As it is basically last years model, you can purchase it and save some bucks, while still getting a very capable camera. In fact, I have been able to print many 5x7 photos that are just as good as most point and shoot 35mm cameras. 

Other features include a cool LCD viewer, (for seeing how bad a photographer you really are), a self timer, manual controls or totally automatic at your choice and a decent battery life.

To be honest, our unit did have one big problem. It stopped focusing about six months into its use. Luckily, the Fuji warranty covered the repair in full except for our shipping costs.  (Trust me -- we beat the HECK out of this little unit too!)

Other things to consider are the fact that it takes about 4-5 seconds of cycle time to take a picture and save it, (this can cause some serious frustration if you miss the birthday candle's being blown out!), that you will definitely need to purchase some additional memory cards and there is no real lense cap. If you want these features, get the year 2000 models. (although you'll pay a premium of course!) 

The unit uses smart media, a cool little memory card about the size of a postage stamp. On a card that costs about $50, you can save between 50-150 pictures depending on the quality you like. The best part? The card is reusable! No more film to buy!

All in all carrying my family memories in my shirt pocket, being able to print them out like actual photos and the fact that I do not have to get pictures of my feet back from the drug store make this little camera way to cool for words.

Bottom line: if you want a great bang for the buck, this is the digital camera for you.
