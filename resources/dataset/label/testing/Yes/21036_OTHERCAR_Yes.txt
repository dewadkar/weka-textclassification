            When we purchased the Tracker in 1994, we were newly married and need an affordable, dependable car.  We were looking for something that was 4-wheel drive.  The first winter we had the tracker, we had SNOW, it was wonderful to just get in the car and go.  You do have to turn the wheel locks on the outside, but other than that it is very easy to use the 4-wheel drive.

It's not a comfort car, for long distance it isn't that comfortable, but for a work car it is great. The gas mileage is very reasonable, I'm not sure of the exact mileage but I do know you went far on one tank of gas. The tracker only has seat belts for 4, there is no middle seat belt in the back, so if you travel with a lot of people, this wouldn't work for you.

It's a very reliable care, we made it 50,000 miles before the tires needed to be replaced.  We have had no major problems with the tracker in the last 5 1/2 years.  The only repairs we have had to make is replace the switch on the heater blower.

We just traded in the tracker, and I must say it will be missed, not many cars last you 6 years with very little repairs.<br><br>
