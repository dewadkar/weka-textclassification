            The Seville is like something out of a dream.  It's majestic appearance caught my eye and I was pleased to find that its attributes went beyond the body.  It corners well and hugs the road.  The Northstar system is a plus.  It allows you to drive to safety if a tire should lose pressure or the oil leaks out of the engine.  Talk about acceleration!  This beast has a powerful engine that will shoot the car forward like a rocket.  There is plenty of legroom in the front and back and the trunk is huge.  It also has the option of heated seats which are good for those cold winter days.  The Seville is very safe too.  Anti-lock brakes and airbags protect you.  This car also lasts a long time.  The one my parents own is going on 90,000 miles strong and it hasn't been to the shop for any major service.  <br><br>
