            	That's the perfect word to describe the 1992 Dodge Caravan! I actually bought this vehicle used for my son, but I drive it as well and desired to let you all know what I thought of it. 

	I usually refrain from American vehicles because they tend to have more problems than foreign cars, but I decided to purchase this vehicle because my son needed something roomy to haul his drumset around in. I didn't want to buy him cargo van because they're way too big to drive around. And I didn't want to get him an SUV either, because they aren't big enough. A mini-van was the answer and a friend was selling a good-conditioned Dodge Caravan, so I figured it would be a wise buy. 

	I was impressed by the Caravan the first time I drove it. It offers a pleasantly smooth ride. I enjoy driving it when I get the chance. It's equipped with airbags, power doors/locks, an Alpine CD/radio with 6 speakers, cruise control and more. The seats are comfortable and the space is very roomy. It's also very good on gas.

	So if you're looking for a decent vehicle with plenty of toys and a smooth ride, test drive the Dodge Caravan today. You'll probably go home with it! <br><br>
