             When I was shopping for a used car a year ago (1999) I came across my '90 Celica on-line.  My boyfriend said he used to own the same car about 2 years ago.  He would still own it if someone didn't slam into it. He told me he loved his car. So I bought mine.

 I have the manual transmission.  I feel like a race car driver!! I was shocked because it is only a 4 clynder. I own the 5-spd 2.2 coupe.
 It corners beutifully! Stops on a dime! I have to say I have avoided other people's careless driving skills with my Celica due to it's fast acceleration and quick responsivness. 
My interior is still 100% gorgeous.  Even after it being over 10 years old, people still tell me what a nice car I have.  I was worried about buying a used car that old because of the mileage, but this car was built to last.  
I had to replace the clutch, but I don't hold that against my car. I let my boyfriend drive it and he is bad with stick shifts :) I have recently learned why my A/C doesn't work, there was a recall in '93 for the A/C component or something, I still have to look into it. My stereo antenna also had to be replaced, not too hard though.
I traded my '90 Celica GT with my friend who has the 2000 GTS.  I didn't like the back window, it was view obstructing.  But if I had to buy a new car, I would stay with the Celica.
This car does not offer leg room in the backseat, unless you have short people in the front (more leg room than the new models). Definatly not a family car, although my 5 year old son loves my car.
If you are looking for a great used car with reliability and grace, this is it!
