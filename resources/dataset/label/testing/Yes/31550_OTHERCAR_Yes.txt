<TEXT>
            In May 2000, I bought a car that I have been considering for years: a Volvo 240 Wagon. I found a 1993 model, which was the last year the 240 was manufactured. It was the biggest purchase I have ever made, but it was probably also the smartest.

A number of things led me to this decision. Primary was Volvo�s legendary commitment to safety. But there were other factors too, namely the car�s reliability, its comfort &amp; roominess, and its general form &amp; function. I�ve detailed all of these reasons below, along with my experiences driving it in the harsh, Minnesota winter. 

At the end of this opinion, I made a point to include some web-based resources that I have found to be helpful both before and after my purchase. I refer to many of them throughout the review. 

There is a lot of detailed information here, so if ever gets to be too much, just skip ahead to the next section. 

<b>Safety</b>
I own two dogs, which I describe to folks as my kids. And like most parents, I am very protective of them. Until I got the 240, I owned a 1986 Volkswagen Golf, a small hatchback. Although the car was fun to drive, I was always nervous when I had to take my �children� somewhere. I actually avoided bringing them on long trips because I felt like was risking their safety.

At a certain point I realized that I needed a vehicle that wouldn�t unnerve me. I considered buying a used Honda Accord wagon from a co-worker, but my research showed that the particular model year yielded a high risk of chest injury in government crash tests. Although it was a great car in all other respects, I had to pass.

I did some other research, and with the exception of a used import with a good safety record, such as a Mercedes (which I couldn�t afford to maintain), or a feature-laden new car (which I couldn�t afford to purchase), few vehicles showed as much promise as the 240.

Volvo has been a leader in automobile safety since its inception, and this was the primary reason I bought the car. The 240, like most models, has a safety roll cage that surrounds its passengers, crumple zones that are designed to absorb the impact of collision, and an engine that slides under the body � rather than into the passenger compartment � in the event of an accident. 

Well before many of their competitors, Volvo offered laminated windshields, padded dashboards, and side impact reinforcements. In fact, it was a Volvo engineer who patented the three-point shoulder/lap belt in 1958. The 1993 240 also came standard with anti-lock brakes and a driver�s side air bag.

Most of the 240s have four-cylinder, 2.3-liter engines, so they obviously cannot accelerate out of situations as well as some vehicles. This can be remedied by getting a turbo or six-cylinder version, or better yet, replacing the engine with a V-8 � something a few Volvo enthusiasts have written books about. 

On the other hand, there are parents of newly-licensed teenagers or twentysomethings who find the idea of getting their kid a slower vehicle to be very attractive safety benefit.

Although it�s handling is adequate for most situations, the 240 is a bit sloppy in emergency turns. I experienced this once when I had to avoid another driver on the freeway who decided that he wanted his car to be where mine was. It all turned out okay, but I would have felt in more control if my wagon didn�t rock momentarily the way it did.

There is a remedy for this, in what many Volvo owners consider their favorite investment: anti-sway bars. One of the primary suppliers of these is IPD, a company in Portland, Oregon. A kit goes for about $250, and unless you�re handy with cars, they probably need to be professionally installed. I have these on my personal wish list.

<b>Reliability</b>
Volvos are famous for lasting a very, very long time, which is why I felt so comfortable plunking down $8,250 for a car with 112,000 miles. I have met a lot of people who have attested that theirs have passed the 200,000 mark, and are still running great. One co-worker has a 740 model with over 325,000 on the odometer. This guy has been waiting for it to die so he can buy a new car, but as of yet, it has refused to give in. 

The Volvo Club of America�s web site has a counter, which tracks the miles of a particular 1800S model. As of this writing, it has logged nearly 1.8 million miles! A man named Irv Gordon bought it new in 1966, apparently because the other car he was considering, a Corvette, cost an extra $1,000 he didn�t want to spend. Needless to say, he seems happy with his decision.

Because of its simplicity and long history, the 240�s four-cylinder engine has a reputation for durability, supposedly taking a fair amount of abuse from owners who don�t change the oil at regular intervals or otherwise neglect their car. Turbo or six-cylinder engines, although faster or more powerful, aren�t known for lasting quite as long. (By the way, the number �4� in the 240 model name generally refers to the number of cylinders. A six-cylinder is typically known as a 260.)

A Volvo is generally more expensive to have professionally repaired than its domestic or Japanese counterparts, and many people point this out as a major reason against buying one. And if you want to take your brick to a Volvo specialist, something I would recommend, you could end up paying more than if you brought it to a general mechanic. I would contend, however, that there are two other factors to consider when doing the math. 

First, you need to look at the overall reliability of the automobile. Since a 240 will outlast many cars, it would be wise to ask yourself: Is the amount of money I would spend in a span of several years (the purchase price of one or more vehicles, plus the cost of repairs) end up being more for the Volvo, or for the other car I am considering?

Second, if you are mechanically inclined, or would simply like to be, you will be glad to know that the 240 is relatively easy to maintain. It is not filled with a lot of the sophisticated electronic equipment common in so many cars today, which actually require you to take it to a mechanic. A qualified specialist, of course, should always take care of complex items like the air bag system.

In addition to the information in a good repair manual (Haynes and Bentley are both popular publishers), the Internet hosts a number of Volvo discussion groups filled with people who are more than happy to dispense advice. (See the resource list below for more information.)

<b>Comfort &amp; Roominess</b>
The 240 is a very comfortable car. In fact, its seats are more comfortable than most of the chairs in my home. There is plenty of legroom for my passengers and me. (And I don�t simply mean canine passengers, although they are happy too.)

One exception occurred this past Election Day, when I volunteered to drive folks to the polls. One of them, a large woman, was barely able to attach her seat belt due to her size. I've heard this concern before, and have been told that Volvo offers a longer replacement belt to accommodate bigger people. 

In terms of overall space, Consumer Reports called the 240 wagon �cavernous.� They�re right; it is absolutely huge inside, especially when the rear seat is folded down. I couldn�t ask for a better cargo vehicle that doubles as a car. I met a couple once who actually sleep in the back of their wagon on road trips, and one of them was a little over six feet tall!

It is a reasonably quiet car too, probably due to soundproofing that came standard in the later model years. (In my Opinion Details, I was unable to rate the Quality and Craftsmanship of this car as �excellent� without also noting that it had �dead quiet ride,� which is bit of an overstatement. I believe that these two things are distinct, so please note this qualification.) 

<b>Form &amp; Function</b>
Volvos are often nicknamed �Swedish Bricks� by their owners due to their boxy body shape (current models notwithstanding). Many professional reviewers have complained that the 240 is kind of an ugly car, but I beg to differ. I find its shape to be very pleasing to the eye, especially the wagons.

The one I bought is �signal red� with tinted windows and factory alloy wheels. It looks a bit more sporty than the standard 240s, and I actually had some reservations about getting it. It�s grown on me though, and I get complements on it all the time.

The interior also has a simple, utilitarian aesthetic. The gauges are clear, and the switches are big and simple. Everything is where it should be. All the parts are pretty solid, and thanks to Volvo�s thoughtful designers, they are easy to take apart and reassemble. I had to do this a couple of times when installing some radio equipment.

I have a couple of minor gripes, though. For one, the interior door releases are recessed into the panel and my passengers sometimes can�t locate them. When it�s dark, I have to turn on the light and show them where theirs is. 

Also, the analog clocks apparently have a bad reputation for reliability. Mine works only occasionally, which is about the same as if it didn�t work at all. A fellow �brickster� told me that this can be remedied by replacing its capacitor (an inexpensive electronic component) with a higher quality one, but I haven�t taken the time to try this.

<b>Fuel Efficiency</b>
Being an environmentalist, I am very aware of the amount of gas a vehicle uses. Unfortunately, at around 23 miles per gallon (on average), I have to give my Volvo low marks in fuel efficiency. This, of course, also translates to higher prices at the pump. My father�s Dodge minivan actually does better at about 28 MPG, and that doesn�t sit well by me.

The 240 weighs in at about 3,000 pounds, or one-and-a-half tons. This is probably a major reason why the car doesn�t do as well as a lighter Honda or Toyota. Of course, these cars don�t have the same level of crashworthiness either.

I�m guessing that fuel efficiency, at the time my car was designed, was not a major priority for Volvo. Either that, or they were not able to make any modifications that didn�t reduce overall reliability.

Interestingly, a Volvo mechanic I met once told me that one of the older 240 models had a optional engine made by Chrysler that was designed to get something in the neighborhood of 30 MPG. I�ve been wondering lately why they stopped offering it, and if it would be reasonable to install one of these engines in my brick. Needless to say, I have my doubts. 

<b>Dashing Through The Snow</b>
For those of you who live in � or drive though � snow country, you may be wondering how the 240 performs in the white stuff. 

I live in Minnesota, where winter weather can last 5 months out of the year. Because the 240 has rear wheel drive, and thus wouldn�t have as much traction as a front wheel- or all wheel drive car, I consulted with a number of folks on this question. 

Invariably, I got one of two different answers. It was either �I�ve never had a problem,� or �Yeah, it�s really bad in the snow.� When I asked about the need for snow tires, the same thing happened: �I�ve never had a problem with my all-seasons,� or �Yeah, you�ll have to get a set.�

As you might have guessed, I didn�t know what to expect once the snow started flying. Well, following a couple of mild winters, Minnesota got dumped on this year, and I discovered that my more pessimistic friends were right. 

My all-season radials were sliding all over the place, but since I had no experience with snow tires, I was not really thrilled about the possibility of spending $400 and then finding out that it still drove poorly. 

After some research, I decided to get a set from Nokian, a Finnish company whose tires have received a number of positive reviews, including some on Epinions.com. 

I was originally going to go with the all-season NRW, which are rated for severe conditions, but because they don�t yet make them for my car, I decided to go with the Hakkapeliitta Q. These are dedicated winter tires advertised to have excellent grip in snow, slush, and ice. (Epinions.com does not yet have a topic for this particular model.)

This has made a monumental difference, and I feel relieved that the 240 can indeed be a good winter car, if properly equipped with a complete set of snow-rated tires, weight over the rear axle, and careful driving. 

Of course, what good is the ability to drive through the snow if you can�t get going? When faced with temperatures that hover between -10� and -20� Fahrenheit, some cars just won�t crank. So far, my car (with its Volvo battery) has consistently started despite these frigid temperatures. 

Finally, with all the salt and chemicals that are poured onto winter roadways, the Volvo 240 is pretty good at resisting rust. The car has a number of channels that are designed to help keep pockets of moisture or standing water from accumulating. By keeping these clear during warm weather, and keeping your car clean, you be blessed with an auto body that will look good for a long time.

<b>Before You Buy</b>
If you decide that a Volvo 240 is the car for you, then I�d like to recommend the following common sense tip, which can make a difference between a owning great used car and one that is troublesome: Make sure that the previous owners took proper care of it.

This includes an inspection by you, meaning a walk around, a test drive, and the manipulation of all the doors, switches, and lights. Peer into every nook and cranny to see if anything jumps out at you.

It should also be looked over by a Volvo specialist to make you aware of any potential problems. Remember, a mechanic that specializes in these cars will likely be able to check for things or identify certain problems that a general mechanic might miss.

Some 240 owners take pride in keeping a complete set of maintenance records that spans the life of the car, and if you are fortunate to find someone who has documentation showing that he or she religiously followed Volvo�s maintenance schedule, especially if the work was done by a dealer, you will likely have found a car that will have a long life. 

Even these inspections or records identify some things that are wrong with the car, you may have still have found a gem. The important thing is that you know what you are getting into before you make the decision to buy.
