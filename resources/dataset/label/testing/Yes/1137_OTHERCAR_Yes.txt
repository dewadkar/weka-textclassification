            Who knew? A litte car people always make fun of has made it main stream.  The new Dodge Neon packs a lot of punch, for an average 4-cyl compact car.

With a newly designed body this car is ready to take you to the 21st century.  The trade mark of the neon, those bug eye like head lights are updated to a stylish futuristic new design.  Definitely eye catching and rather appealing for a lower priced car.

I think that the best reason for buying this car is the handling.  Cruise around some curves and feel the car hug them and move so silky through your hands.  Yeah the speed may not get up there but you shouldn't be driving that fast anyway, right? 

The inside of the car is designed with surprisingly a large amount of space, easily fits a person with a larger build and height.  As compared to other cars of the same level, the Toyota Camry for instance, there is not nearly the same amount of space inside.  When they designed this car they thought about everyones needs and put them all together for a really great car.

Loose those stereo types that this is a measly chic car with nothing to offer.  Not only does it look nice, but it is comfortable and priced well at under 15,000.  Sounds good to me!<br><br>
