            <b>Background:</b>
I have been using Nikon 35mm equipment for over 15 years.  I'm hardly a pro, but I have taken lots of classes and shoot with a Nikon N90S (high end amateur, low end pro model).  I guess I'm spoiled!  Unfortunately, I don't have any other digital camera experience so I can't compare this camera to the competition.

<b>Why I wanted to go Digital:</b>
I have resisted buying a digital camera for a long time because of the price and my perception of the quality I could get for my budget (I was looking in the under $400 range).

However, with prices coming down, I really wanted to get a digital camera because I love to sell on Ebay and now needed to sell some items that couldn't be scanned on a flatbed scanner.  I didn't want to shoot 35 mm photos then scan them, so I thought a digital camera would help.  I also wanted to put photos of my crafts on the internet (again, items that can't be scanned on a flatbed).  So I figured I wouldn't need anything fancy since I wasn't intending to print the photos.

<b>Product Review:</b>
I bought this camera mail order and was disappointed that the charger was DOA (it doesn't work).  After 1 hour (my phone timed it!), Nikon finally answered the phone and confirmed that it was broken and offered a replacement - BUT only after I paid to ship it and they'd have to receive it before they'd give me a new one.  ARRGHHH.  I have very little free time and since I wanted to Ebay during the holidays, I broke down and bought the A/C adapter/charger.  I figured it was better than going a minimum of 2 weeks without a charger or buying disposable lithium batteries.  

I shot several indoor pictures and was rather impressed when I saw them on the LCD screen.  I tried using the view finder but it's so small that I gave up and used the LCD screen instead.  If you use the viewfinder, you'll be happy to know that the zoom adjusts the view in the viewfinder so that you have an idea of what you'll be shooting.

What's truly impressive is the ability to transfer to the computer.  Just plug the USB cord into the camera and computer and zoom...they get loaded.  I tried this on my Win98 computer and my new WinXP computer and both were VERY smooth.  It's better with WinXP because Windows recognizes the camera and instantly asks you if you want to copy all the photos to the picture folder.  It also offers the option of deleting the photos from the memory card (very convenient!).  With WinXP, I don't use the Nikon software at all!  I can't comment much on the Nikon software because I didn't use it much on my Win98 machine.

Another positive is the white balance adjustment.  I've learned to take a reading in each lighting environment before taking pictures.  I have white doors in my house so I've been using that as a target, but you can use a bright white index card.  It only takes a minute and really improves the color quality of your photos!

Low light photos are remarkably good, all things considered.  I shot a few photos of an indoor room with the lights off (just ambient light from the next room) and the paint color came out great and you could actually see the contents of the room (the flash is strong!).  That image was better than what you could see with your eyes.  However, it was a slightly blurry image (acceptable on the computer, but I don't think it'd make a decent print).  I haven't tried the same shot with a tripod, which may have removed some of the blurriness.

Then, I started taking pictures of my stuff that I wanted to put on Ebay.  The pictures were a bit blurry.  I tried bracing myself...still blurry.  Finally, I whipped out the tripod.  Blurriness gone.  So I set up my mini-studio and placed all my items under the camera and shot all my photos.  Once I figured it all out it was super fast to shoot the photos and get them on my computer.

<b>Positives:</b>
- White balance - learn to use it to get great colors indoors!

- Small, light weight.  BUY THE CASE - it's cute, inexpensive and will help to protect your investment.  You can wear it around your neck.

- Zoom is smooth and works well

- Range of exposure compensation is as high as my 35mm camera (-1 to +1)

- The manual is pretty clear...if you read it!  


<b>Complaints:</b>
Keep in mind...I may be picky because I have a great SLR!  Also, I don't know how this camera compares to other digital cameras.

- SLOW shutter speed.  One review said it was 2 seconds long.  I can believe it!  I think this is causing some of the blurriness.  

- Lack of slow sync - I guess I was expecting a bit much! Many of the flash photos are overexposed.  I used the exposure compensation and that does help.  However, I'd rather have the camera measure how much flash is needed based on the ambient light.

- A/C adapter charger (a $60 additional cost) doesn't charge the battery while it's in the camera!  EEK!  And if you remove the battery from the camera for "too long" (I don't know the exact amt of time), the date stamp will be lost.  It's also big and clunky.  Frankly, I don't know why they didn't just add a plug to the camera on the charger that is included with the camera!  This accessory is 5"x3"...large enough to be a pain to travel with (the included charger is 1/2 that size).  I'm glad I bought the adapter rather than buying a second battery...but it's not perfect.

- The wrist strap kept getting in the way when I had the camera on a tripod pointed downward.

- Removal of the battery seems to cause the camera to forget the settings (ie quality, size)...check your settings before shooting.  The included charger requires removal of the battery...so use two so that there's always one in the camera or get used to resetting the date/settings.  I think I kept the battery out of the camera only for 4-6 hours and it "forgot" everything.

- Nikon support - I've only called once but 1 hour on hold is a LONG time!!!  I almost gave up!

<b>Recommendation:</b>
As far as recommending this to a friend...it depends on what my friend needs and how sophisticated a photographer that person is.  For the casual home user, I think this is a good camera.  For someone who really enjoys photography, I would recommend that you save your money and get a higher model!  I'm satisfied with the camera for my needs (internet photos), but I will not be using it for memorable moments (like vacation, birthdays etc).
