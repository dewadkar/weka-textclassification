            I love this car!  I bought the Elantra after test driving Honda, Saturn, Pontiac Sunfire, and a Daewoo.  This car by far gives you more for your money.  Where else can you get power windows/locks, air conditioning, AM/FM Cassette stereo and more for around $10,000?  The warranty really drew me to the vehicle as well.  It is much better than any of the vehicles I took for a test drive.  The only issues I have with the vehicle is the Dealer service.  I did have one problem with the breaks squeaking at 7,000 miles.  I took the vehicle in for service and the service manager told me that it would be $38 for an adjustment on the brakes.  If you look in the owners manual adjustments are covered for 12 months or 12,000 miles.  I had to show this to the general manager to have this fee waved, as the service manager would not budge.  He also told me I need to follow the service schedule for severe driving rather than the normal schedule in order for the warranty to be valid.  I have been in contact with Hyundai and they say that is not true but that they cannot control what the dealerships do or say because they are independently owned and operated.
I would still recommend this vehicle for people looking for a small reliable car, or like in my case their first new vehicle.<br><br>
