            <b>Background</b>
I spent many hours looking at opinions here, Imaging Resource, Digital Preview, and other web sites for all kinds of prosumer cameras.  I ended up with the Nikon 880 because of it's small form factor, Nikon's reputation, and its good image quality.  Those all turned out to be true, but the poor indoor shots, cheesy software, noisy focus, and stuck pixels caused me to buy a Canon Powershot G1 instead.  Even now it's not an easy choice.  See my review on the Nikon 880 for more info.  You can find samples from both cameras at: http://www.fototime.com/inv/914B45D1E3088A1

I am going to write the rest of the review, comparing the two cameras.  Part of this is because, these are the first digital cameras that I have ever owned, so this is the only comparison I can make.  Also, I would have loved to see more head-to-head comparisons from others because in the end, that was what I was looking for the most (and unable to find).  It's easy to like a camera, if your previous camera was 3-year old technology.  I was able to compare two brand new digital cameras side-by-side, and I hope others can benefit from that.

<b>Price</b>
I will mention price only because the Canon Powershot G1 is priced at a steal in my opinion!  It's selling at $799, even in physical retail stores.  Keep in mind that it includes a rechargeable battery and charger.  I bought mine at Circuit City, but Ritz Cameras is also selling them for the same price (if you can find them in stock).  I bought the Nikon 880 for $699 locally, but the AC adapter and rechargeable battery adds $100 minimum.  So, in essence, the two cameras are identically priced.

<b>Image Quality</b>
Image quality is a big deal for me because the feature set is worthless if I am unhappy with the pictures.  To be honest, I am still unsure which camera produced better images.  The Canon works far better under low light conditions.  Part of it is the weak flash from the Nikon 880.  Part of it must have to do with the lens or the CCD because even outdoor pictures in cloudy or dark conditions favored the Canon.  Granted, I could have adjusted some settings in both cameras to optimize them, but I wanted to see how they compared under (nearly) automatic settings.  Outdoor pictures initially favored the Nikon, which just seemed more pleasing to the eye in color and depth.  I boosted the contrast setting in the Canon, and the test images after that seemed to be slightly better than the Nikon.  However, the colors on the Nikon still seemed slightly better to my eye.  One big drawback on the Canon is that there is quite a bit of purple fringing.  In most pictures, it's barely noticeable but not distracting.  If you blow up the picture, it is extremely noticeable on some pictures.  I gave the slight edge to the Canon because I had problems getting good focus on the Nikon.  The Canon seemed to do a better job.

<b>Macro Mode</b>
There is no doubt that the Nikon 880 is the better camera for macro shots.  I found that I could take pictures of flowers very well, without even using the macro mode.  With the macro mode, you can focus down to a very small area.  In contrast, I had to use the macro mode on the Canon on the flower shots.  However, it's not really possible to take pictures of anything smaller.  Perhaps with the optional macro lens, it might match the Nikon.  For most of what I am doing, the Canon is good enough.  I find comfort in that I can always buy an extra lens.  The extra bulk probably won't be a problem since I expect most macro shots to be done around the house.

<b>Movies</b>
I don't expect to do much movie taking, but thought I would mention it anyway.  The Canon has the definite edge here.  First of all, I found the movies in the Canon to be much smoother.  The Nikon seemed to have this jerky web-cam feel to it.  Secondly, the Canon records audio as well, although it sounded pretty tinny on the one movie that I did.  I never tested out playback on a TV with the Nikon.  However, I was impressed that the Canon played back movies on a TV without any problems.

<b>Usability</b>
Overall, the Nikon 880 is clearly more consumer oriented than the Canon.  The Nikon 880 is really user friendly for viewing the images.  All of the controls are very intuitive like the fact that zooming into an image is controlled by the zoom buttons for the camera.  On the Canon, you have to use a separate button for zooming, and the zoom is fixed at 2.5x and 5x.

On the other hand, the Canon is much friendlier to the photographer.  It's inherently a two-hand camera, but that works nicely if your focus is taking pictures.  The Nikon is so tiny that I kept putting my left hand on places that I shouldn't.  The Canon also has more buttons which allow most settings to be adjustable with a one or two button pushes.  The Nikon often required odd combinations which I had trouble remembering.  The Canon also allows most of those settings to be adjusted and displayed without the LCD.  The black and white LCD on top shows pretty much everything.

The swiveling LCD on the Canon is an awesome feature!  It is much less gimmicky that I initially thought.  First of all, it's extremely well built.  Secondly, it can be closed so that the LCD cannot be damaged.  Lastly, I found lots of situations where I got a better shot with the camera very low or high.  Being able to swivel the LCD allowed me to take better shots.  At the very least, it made me more comfortable since I could always stand up.

<b>Viewing</b>
The one killer feature on the Nikon, which is missing on the Canon is the quickview.  It allows you to review the pictures you have taken without switching out of shooting mode.  The Nikon even lets you delete pictures, or view thumbnails without switching modes.  This is really great for deciding whether or not to take another shot.  On the Canon, you have to switch to the play mode to view or delete anything (other than the initial preview after the picture is taken).  With the Nikon, I got used to pulling up the last picture or two to check my shots.  With the Canon, I got used to crossing my fingers and taking extra shots just in case.

<b>Panoramic</b>
This feature alone is worth getting the Canon.  With the Nikon, I found many situations where I could not fit an entire scene on one image.  I usually compromised by cutting off something in the picture.  I didn't realize how much I was compromising until I got the Canon.  Then I started taking lots of panoramics.  This feature works great!  The stiching seems to be very accurate.  Of the 4-5 panoramics that I have taken, all of them have been stitched together perfectly.  The Canon also gives you several options on how to take the panoramics: left-to-right, right-to-left, bottom-to-top, top-to-bottom, and clock-wise.  Another extremely useful feature is that it always shows you part of the previous picture that you took, so that you can line up the next picture accurately.  I did run into one occasion where the scenery I was taking didn't have any nice lines or landmarks to allow me to align it well, but that seems pretty rare.

<b>LCD</b>
All of the professional reviews that I have seen praise the Canon LCD.  It's definitely brighter than the Nikon 880, which helps outdoors.  However, I found the Nikon 880 screen to be better most of the time.  For some reason, I couldn't see the features on the Canon very clearly.  In contrast, the pictures on the Nikon are fantastic!  Maybe my eyes are too sensitive or something, because I haven't heard anyone else complain.

<b>Software</b>
As I stated in the other review, the Nikon 880 software is a joke.  I definitely feel like the Canon software is better, especially since it includes Photoshop LE.  It also includes a reasonable image cataloger that I actually use!  One thing interesting about the Canon is that you can <b>upload</b> pictures from the PC to the camera.  I think this would really be useful if you are visiting relatives and want to use the camera as a slide-show projecter to the TV.  With the remote that Canon includes, this is super user-friendly.  My wife and I used it after a recent trip and found it quite fun!

<b>Noise</b>
Normally, I would never think to mention noise with a camera, but the Nikon is downright annoying!  I ended up turning off the continuous focus because it was so noisy.  I think you could probably get used to it.  However, when I first got the Canon, I was amazed how quiet it was in comparison.  You can't really hear much.  Generally, this won't be a problem, but don't take the Nikon to a wedding if you are going to use continuous focus!

<b>Conclusion</b>
I would recommend the Nikon 880 for people who want high quality, but are mainly looking for a good "weekend" camera.  It's much easier to view and delete pictures.  It's so small and light that you can easy keep it in a jacket pocket without noticing it much.  The Canon cannot be missed.  I rode a mountain bike with it in my jacket, and it felt like a little brick.

For anyone who is more interested in taking "photos", I would definitely recommend the Canon PowerShot G1.  At the same price, it's a much better value.  The swivel LCD allows much more creativity with picture taking.  It has more controls over the shots.  The remote control is absolutely awesome for turning your camera into an instant slide show.  I expect it to be a real hit when I see my family on Memorial Day weekend.  The ability to use Type II Compact Flash just seals the deal.  Anyone serious about experimenting with photography will find even a 64 MB flash card limiting.  I was surprised to use mine up after a 30 minute mountain bike ride.  Add the panoramic feature, and the superior movies, and you have a real winner!

P.S. - The Canon PowerShot G1 is supposed to have really good battery life, but I have been unable to test that.

<b>Update</b>
I have had the camera a few weeks now, and a few things came out of that experience.  I used the movie mode while playing golf with my family to analyze our swings.  It's much easier to move frame-by-frame with an AVI file, than it is using a video camera (which I have also tried before).  Also, the 30 second limitation doesn't really come into play, since a swing only takes up 5-10 seconds including a little verbal commentary.  The movie playback from the camera is useful, but limited.  The sound quality was surprisingly good, once I downloaded to my PC to play.  The video is very grainy, but suprisingly smooth.  Extremely useful for swing analysis and much more convenient than lugging around a video camera.  It also meant I didn't have to do any post editing.  I just organized the AVI files by each person, and put them into separate folders so that we could each see our swings.  BTW, I discovered my posture was horrible and was able to make adjustments on the golf course!

The LCD screen is definitely worse than the Nikon 880 in my opinion.  Everything looks much brighter than the final picture.  This makes it extremely difficult to judge exposure.

I have already ordered the IBM 1GB Microdrive.  Even a 64 MB card is no where close enough in my opinion.  Even day trips can easily fill up 64 MB at 3 megapixel resolutions, especially if you want to try several angles or exposures to get that perfect shot.  My brother has a Sony digital camera and was stunned when I told him I could put a gig on the camera!

I am very paranoid about running out of batteries, but that has yet to happen.  I have probably taken about 100 MB of video/pictures over two days and the batteries were still fine.  Still watching this though...

Overall, I am happy with my choice.  For my next camera, I want everything in the Canon plus: better LCD, faster startup time, faster shots/sec, more zoom, fill flash, and higher quality videos.
