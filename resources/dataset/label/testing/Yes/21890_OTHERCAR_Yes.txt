            Just got my new 2000 528i, in a gorgeous new color for this model, &quot;anthracite&quot;, with black vinyl upholstery. My love affair with Bavarian Motor Works started in 1979 with a 320i, and since then, two more 3-series, 318i (weak) and 325is (splendid), two 6 series, 633(gorgeous)
and a  1988 635 (even more gorgeous) which is my toy now, and finally a 1998 528i which I traded for the 2000. Well, these cars keep getting better and better, while at the same time retaining that unique BMW ride,
firm but quiet.
I love the new transmission, 5 speed auto/manual. I am now convinced with this transmission you can get as fast to 60 mph as with a manual, and, if you were not a very good manual transmission driver, faster. The engine purrs with the traditional beautiful sound of all BMW 6-cylinder engines. And the brakes; they are incredibly effective; I haven't looked at the numbers, but I would be surprised if it isn't one the shortest stopping distances in the industry. There is a feeling of extraordinary strength about the car. 
Is there anything here not perfect? I can't find it, with the exception, for me, (I am an industrial designer), of the styling, which has gotten too rounded and slightly bloated for my taste (of course, I have it parked next to the ultimate BMW classic, the 635). It certainly looks better in darker colors, white makes it look especially rounded.
Other than that, I scratch my head and I think, how can this car be improved?<br><br>
