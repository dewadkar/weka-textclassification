            I love my 4Runner.
I really do.

I purchased it to upgrade to a &quot;family&quot; vehicle- and compared to my Chevy pickup, it is like riding in a galaxy class starship.  It has power everything- not to mention plush seats, a nicely designed dash, and all the bells and whistles.  Driving this vehicle is pure heaven. It practically purrs, and contrary to what I had heard, it does have wonderful power.  The four wheel drive is easy to use, and the owner's manual is very clear for those who have never driven an SUV before.  

I would recommend this vehicle for anyone who has a family.  The back seat is very &quot;kid-friendly&quot;, and car seat installation is a breeze.  For anyone (like me!) who owned a two door before, the transition to four doors is a dream!  All the seats seem to be equally comfortable, unlike some SUVs with hard, unyielding back seats.  The suspension in the car is very comfortable, as well, so it has a ride more like a car rather than a truck.  My whole family loves it, and that isn't an easy trick!  I highly recommend this vehicle.

The only possible problems I can see are a blind spot in the driver's right hand field of vision, and the somewhat elevated cost.  It is, however, a lot of car for the money- a bit expensive, but a good value nonetheless.<br><br>
