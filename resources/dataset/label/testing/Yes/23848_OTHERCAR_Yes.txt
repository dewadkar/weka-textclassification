            I purchased one of these camera to &quot;upgrade&quot; from what I had.  I got this on an auction for only $100.  Below retail I believe. I am very happy with the clarity of the photos.  This has some different setings to experiment with.  I bought this MAINLY for my auctions.  I have taken some photos of 5 month old grandson to email and they are good.  This is easy to use AFTER reading the instructions slowly and carefully.  I find my best photos are taken in sunlight, or if doing auction photos, i need to have the curtains pulled back so that there is daylight.  Otherwise <i> sometimes </i> the photos turn out reddish in color.  Generally I am quite pleased with the amount of functions for the price.  However, it does use up batteries FAST.  Perhaps it's the type of batteries I buy and I have been experimenting with different brands.  All in All, I would recommend this for the occasional photographer OR someone who wants to get some auction photos online fast. Also for emailing family photos or pet shots to friends and relatives.<br><br>
