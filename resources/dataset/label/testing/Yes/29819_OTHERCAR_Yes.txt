            I've had my DC 260 for almost a year now.  Overall, I
thinks it a great camera.  I still keep finding great
uses for it.  I've taken over 5000 pictures with it
in that time.  A few weeks ago, I &quot;discovered&quot; the time
lapse feature.  I've created some great AVI's of sun rises,
and sunsets in the Smoky Mountains on vacation.

This cameras has a lot of bells and whistles.  One
simple example is when you take a picture in
portrait mode, with the camera rotated 90 degrees,
the image is automatically rotated.  There is no
needed to rotate in Photoshop.  I played around
with a friend's Olympus C2000 and was amazed that
this new camera wouldn't do the same!  We had to
rotated the images in an photo editing program.

The resolution is what set it apart (1536X1024)
from other cameras at the time I purchased.  Also, 
since it uses compact flash  I can plug the CF card
into an adapter and slide it right into my laptop.  The
CF card mounts as a drive and I can copy pictures extremely
fast.  Just remember, serial is like a bicycle, USB is like a 
motor cycle and plugging into a PCMCIA slot is like a rocket!

I would highly recommend that you purchase a 48 MB or 
great CF card.  The 8 MB card, just isn't enough.  It's good
enough for about 18 high resolution, high quality pictures.

With my 48MB card, I can get about 100 
high resolution, high quality pictures.  These
look fantastic when printed on a nice printer.

The 3X optical zoom is nice.  But it would be nice if this
were more like 5X.  That's really my main complaint after owning
this camera for a year.

Here are the negatives : 
 - The LCD display eats batteries (it's not needed since there is a view finder.
 - Rechargable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are needed. (comes standard on newer cameras)
 - 3X optical zoom is sometimes not enough
