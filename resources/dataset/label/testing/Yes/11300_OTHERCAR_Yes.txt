            My wife and I purchased this car in November of 2001, not long after it was introduced.  After reading all of the magazine reviews, I had to give this car a try for myself.  After a 20 minute drive I was sold and started shopping around for the best deal.  Unfortunately, since the car had just came out we did not get that great of a deal on it.  That's probably not the case now though.

I had also driven several of the other cars in this price range and none of them gave the same feeling that this car had.  It comes with the total package.  Great handling, great quality, and nice looks.  Other cars that I drove may have matched it in one or two categories, but they didn't get everything right like Mazda did with the Protege5.

To be fair there are a few negatives that I can think of about the Protege5.  The windnoise from the roof racks was considerably louder then I would've liked.  I solved this by removing the racks, which in my opinion gave the car a cleaner look.  My wife liked it better with the racks on.  I think that Mazda has since redesigned the racks to be less noisy.  Also we found that the car averaged about 27mpg.  Other cars in this segment seem to be getting well over 30mpg.  

The best thing about the car:  I have not been back to the dealer for one single thing since we've purchased it.  It has been absolutely trouble free.
