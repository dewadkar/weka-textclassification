            I'm not going to bore you with any story. My older car basically died at 92,000 miles from a bad cam shaft. I didn't want to spend money fixing it when I'd already spent over $6,000 trying to get my clunker to run. Bad move on my part.

My parents always wanted to get me a Saturn. My mom has a 1994 SL2, my dad has a 1998 SL2. So why not keep the tradition of getting an SL2 every four years?

I got myself a brand-new (12 miles on the car) Saturn SL2. I am quite pleased. Compared to my old 1989 Dodge Daytona, riding in this car is a pleasure.

There are few things that I can even pretend to complain about. At high speeds and during cold temperatures you can feel air seeping in through the seems of the windows, not a problem. When the car starts up during mid-day, a lot of air blows in through the vents even though I haven't turned on the fan or A/C at all! The daytime running lamps are nice, but the green light in the instrument cluster gets a little annoying.

The sound system is excellent! I was amazed at how nicely it sounded. Deep bass and clear treble from the four coaxial speakers impacted the sale for me.

Saturn's new option: to pre-pay the servicing with a few more dollars added to monthly payments, is a good idea. The price went up from about 14,500 base to 17,000 with my options. I bought a model with a custom tint job, and I am happy to say that I got it!

Other than that, the car has less than 500 miles and I feel silly writing this review. I've been on the road ever since I got it last week and I can't wait to get back on it!
