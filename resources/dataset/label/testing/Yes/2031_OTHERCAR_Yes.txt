            I have owned three of these great Mercurys in the last few years.  I have never liked Ford products but I discovered this Mercury about 15 years ago and was very impressed with the fit and alignment of all the parts.  The comfort is equal to a Lincoln, there is a tiny bit more noise in the Mercury, but the average person will never notice.  I now have a 2000 model and now I have to complain a little.  I don't know what year they did it, but I don't like the downsizing, it is still the best car in it's class though.  I understand there will be a gradual phase out of this car and it will become another model and they will drop the Mercury name.  It is still the best.<br><br>
