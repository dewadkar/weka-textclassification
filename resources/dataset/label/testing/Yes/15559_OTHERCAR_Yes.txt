            Like most people my age (mid twenties), I always related the Oldsmobile to the older generation: luxury cars for your grandparents.  However, I recently had the experience of driving the 2001 Oldsmobile Alero Coupe, 2 door.  I drove the Bright Red version, with the pewter colored leather seats.  I must say I had a great time driving this car.  It had pretty good acceleration, the braking was smooth and easy, and I really enjoyed the remote unlocking feature for the doors and trunk.  Also, the interior looked great!  It's a comfortable car, has a sun-roof, and the stereo system isn't bad either, if you're not looking to blast your fellow drivers.  When I let someone else drive the car, I and another friend fit comfortably in the backseat.  Although, if you're fairly tall, you may not be as comfortable.  Still, this is just a great car overall. 

However, I did have some problems getting used to looking at my blind spot.  I don't know if it was because I'm a smaller person or because I'm just used to being able to see behind me, but I could not get a full view of my blindspot.  The seat belt shoulder harness was in the way.  It's pretty large and bulky.  This really bothered me when I started driving, but I began to realize that I can see enough of my blindspot to make a safe lane change.

I would definitely recommend this car, and as I am buying a car soon, this car is definitely at the top of my list!
