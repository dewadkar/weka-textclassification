              My personal opinion on the Corsica is that it is a good vehicle for the cost you pay to get it.  Mine is a '93 model (I bought it in October '99) and so far it hasn't given me much trouble other than an alternator failure (which is common once a car reaches 60,000 miles anyway).  I think that the V6 on this car is overated, since it uses more gas and does not take any advantage of the 3 speed auto. transmission (and no real noticable acceleration increase compared to 4 cylinder motor)in the car.  With a 4 speed trans. this car would be much more gas efficient on highways, thus making it a better traveling car, but as is, the car uses a whole tank of gas just going from where I live to Columbus, Ohio and back (only 63 miles each way)!  I think either a 4 cylinder motor or a mannual transmission would also improve efficiency.  So far as comfort goes, I find myself fully comfortable in the seats, and all of the controls are easy to handle and understand.  I've noticed that if I have to step on the gas to make a quick run for any reason, the car seems to sit for a fraction of a second and think about it (perhaps the injectors are dirty?).  Compare this car to a Ford Taurus, and (to me) it is a close match.  The Taurus' 4spd transmission helps, but has a tendancy to fail and need replacement on older models (before 92').  I would say that the Corsica makes a good &quot;first car&quot; or family car.  Not flashy, but it will get you where you need to go with enough style that you don't feel like you are driving a 70's car.  It will NEVER beat a Volkswagen though, but that is another story.<br><br>
