            I have just returned from a week-long business trip to Maryland. During that time, my rental car for this period was a 2000 Pontiac Gran Prix GT sedan. My car was dark green metallic with a charcoal cloth interior and alloy wheels. It was powered by the 200  hp 3.8 liter V-6 mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. 

I had previously rented the Gran Prix's more conservative sister - the Buick Regal sedan for a trip to San Francisco. The Gran Prix is a much sportier-looking vehicle with its more aggressive styling, rear spoiler, and front driving/fog lights located in the front valance panel beneath the bumper. Unlike Pontiac's overly heroic styling of the recent past, the styling was more subdued. The body sides were mercifully free of the corrugated plastic cladding giving the car a much cleaner appearance. 

The interior was charcoal gray cloth and dark gray and black plastic. I wish auto manufacturers would ration out more wood and chrome accents in their lower-priced cars. Fake timber doesn't look bad if it's executed well. The Gran Prix's interior had absolutely no wood or chrome accents giving it a somewhat industrial appearance. At least the plastics seemed to be of good quality. 

The dashboard was well laid out and easy to read. I really liked the instruments' novel red-orange back lighting. I also liked the fact there was a temperature gauge. What I don't understand is why there was a large tachometer in a car equipped with an automatic transmission. I would rather have seen an ammeter and oil pressure gauge in its place. 

The radio controls were large and easy to understand. The sound was crisp and clear, but I felt the bass was a little weak.The heating/air conditioning system was effective and efficieint, especially the defog/defrost. Fogged windows cleared almost instantly! The controls also were large and easy to understand with settings for both the driver and passenger. 

The gearshift was located in a floor console with PRND321 indicated in a lighted panel to the left. The gearshift selector indicator also appeared on the dashboard with a tiny red-orange light above each gear. The trouble is, the floor console gearshift selector had no pointer. You had to look at the dashboard to see the gear selected. Many times, I thought the car was in Drive when looking at the floor console, when in reality it was in 3rd Gear. Likewise what appeared to be Reverse on the floor console was actually Neutral. 

I like the look of the steering wheel with two large &quot;grips&quot; at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The car was equipped with driver's and passenger's air bags, but the steering wheel avoided the &quot;Kleenex-box mounted in the hub&quot; look. Unfortunately, the horn buttons were mounted so far inboard of  the steering wheel rim that it was difficult to use the horn without removing your hand from the wheel. A nice touch was the rubber guard below the ignition switch to keep a swaying keychain from scratching up the steering column. 

Other nice interior touches were cubby-holes everywhere to stow small items and change, and a trunk pass-through and cup holders in the rear seat arm rest. Window and lock controls were easy to operate. The doorlocks also had a warning chime that sounded when you pressed the lock button, possibly to keep you from locking the keys in the car. Unfortunately, the ashtray was ridiculously small. Visibility was very good with large expanses of glass and large rearview mirrors mounted on both doors.   

The trunk seemed shallow-looking at first, but it was sufficient to stow several suitcases and garment bags. 

Power from the 200 hp 3.8 liter V-6 was very good, but seemed to lag a little when passing. This could possibly be because I'm used to V-8s. I believe there is a 240 hp version of the 3.8 liter but it is only available on a few models. The ride was smooth and comfortable even after four hours non-stop. The seats were very comfortable, even for passengers in the rear compartment. Gas mileage was respectable and the car was happy with 87 octane fuel. I managed to use only a quarter tank after 205 miles. 

All and all I'd recommend the Gran Prix as a sportier alternative to the Buick Regal. People shopping for a Camry, Accord or Taurus should also consider the Gran Prix as a nice alternative. As nice as a Camry or Accord may be, I feel this Pontiac has a lot more personality. <br><br>
