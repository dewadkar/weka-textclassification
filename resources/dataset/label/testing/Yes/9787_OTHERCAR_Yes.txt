            I read a lot of reviews before buying my first S1 Pro. Right now I have two of them, but I have never seen the two of them together because if one isn't at Fuji repair headquarters, the other is.

Even right now we're working with only one because the other is being repaired under warranty for more than a month now.

So, to my experience, this is the most fragile camera we have ever owned (although maybe I'm unfairly comparing it to our Nikon F5 and Mamiya RB67s). 

But it gets the job done, anyway, and that's one of the reasons why we bought two of them. Beside the price, that is. I hope that the upcoming S2 patches all those cons.

The best thing about this camera is without any doubt its great image color tones, kind of Fujifilm Velvia. The skin tones are superb. And I can easily enlarge a 20x24 using its native 3.1 resolution with some modifications in Photoshop.

I don't share the opinion of some of the reviewers who say that the camera is not for the beginners. In my opinion, this is a nice beginner camera, and a very good entry digital camera for professionals and serious amateurs as well. It has more things that will appeal better to the beginner and enthusiast than it has for the pros or to serious amateurs, like integrated pop-up flash. The only problem a beginner is the high price tag.

I find the lack of a flash sync plug very disturbing, but one can always buy an aftermarket shoemount adapter with x-sync.

A nice thing to notice is that it can use Smartmedia, Compactflash, and even Microdrives.

I recommend the buyer to get this camera and use it on a tripod and don't move it unnecessarily. Please, don't drop it or bump it with objects, always try to ground yourself before touching it, etc. We tried to use it for location wedding photography, but we rather use our Nikon F5 that is light years more rugged. The S1 Pro is since then on a wheeled camera stand and we don't use it outside the studio. We don't want to pay Fuji $650 Dlls again to get it repaired.

We don't use it on batteries, since it uses a lot of them, so we prefer to use the AC adapter.
