            I've been using my camera for about six months now and love it.  If you want to see an example of them go to http/:www.picturetrail.com/jimyster and click on the Dallas Parade.  You'll see lots of colors and notice the action shots how it stops the juggling of pins in motion.  I did extensive research on the internet for digital cameras $500 and under. The runners where Olympus 360L, Kodak 210, and Olympus D460Z. And it is a very impressive camera overall.

The camera itself offers wide angle or zoom 3x shots. It also offers a 3x cropping to bring it to 6x. It's menu is very easy to use out of the box. Has 2 menu modes, one with camera active, one when it's not active (setup mode.) It's auto focus is by holding the button halfway down for a sec, then clicking. It's wide/zoom is a small lever next to shutter button for easy access. You can use it's LCD or to save on batteries it's normal view frame for taking shots. The smartmedia card and batteries easily installs/uninstalls. If offers what they call a Paranormal mode which takes multiple pictures on one frame. It offers a sequence mode that lets you take 10 pictures back to back with for a series shot. You will need to format your SmartMedia card if it's not from Olympus, but it's fast and easy to do. My only gripes are when closing the lens cover, you have to be careful and let the lens retrack first, so you just close it a little, then the rest of the way after lens is back in. The flash flips up, and seems a little clumsey there, but it works fine. You will need to purchase more than just this camera when you buy it. What it comes with is: 2 lithium batteries, a hand strape, an 8meg smart media card. And what else you need would be: a carrying case (est $24-$40), a bigger smart media card (I got a 16meg est $60-$80), NiMH Batteries w/charger(they aren't cheap but worth it est $40-$110), a smart media reader (est $40-$60), and maybe the power adaptor (est $60-$70). With a 16meg card I get 36 shots in sqhq mode. And with my NiMH batteries, after one month of use, I still haven't had to replace them. Normal alkline recharables last maybe 30-40 shots, the NiMH last more like 300-400 shots. I use the lithium that came with it for backup batteries and place them in my case with 8meg memory card. A SmartMedia reader is a must for getting the pictures to your computer. Otherwise you will have to use the serial connection to the camera and very slowly d/l the pics. Which means you'd have to have a power adaptor because it would drain your batteries. With a media reader, it's like using a zip drive, and see the MediaSmart card as another drive, and you just drag and drop your pics to your drive, fast, simple, and very slick. If you choose to purchase this camera, you will be more than pleased that you did. But be aware, you will need to make a few more purchases in accessories to truely enjoy this camera.
