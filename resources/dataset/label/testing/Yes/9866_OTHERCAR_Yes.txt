            There is no doubt that Toyota Sequoia is an affordable addition to the group comprising RAV4, Land Cruiser, 4Runner, and Highlander.  Ever since I read about the Sequoia that has been built on the Tundra platform, I made myself a mental note to test-drive it.  Each time I had a chance to drop by the local dealership, I checked it out.  The day I was scheduled to drive it to nearby freeway 41 was a rainy one.  The rain drops were hitting the windshield as if it were hailing.  The dealership employee, riding with me, leaned over from the passenger seat and helped me locate the defroster.  It was getting cloudy in the front.  All along, I felt very safe and comfortable.  I had enough head and leg room.  It reminds me of my Jeep.

<b>Spacious, huge and imposing on the road</b>

The 2001 Sequoia SR5 4X4 is powered by a 4.7 liter V-8 engine.  When it stopped raining, I did not hesitate to pass some of the other vehicles on the road.  Fortunately, the employee was there to remind me to take it easy.  I should quickly add that, by then, we had reached an area where it was not raining at all.  It was plainly dry.  Since the SUV was running low on gas, I was instructed to pull over at the local gas station to half-fill the vehicle.  At that point, I got something to drink.
I proceeded to check the cargo area and the interior.  It is huge.  In my opinion, any families with children should take advantage of a moderately-priced vehicle such as this 2001 Sequoia truck.

<b>Ford and GM should take notice: Toyota's engineering is at work!</b>

The competition in this segment of the automobile industry is harsh.  Ford came up with the expedition.  Then, it was time to introduce the killer/gas guzzler Excursion.  It appears that no automaker did not want to be left out in the cold.  GM came up with Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon.  Even Huyundai introduced its own brand of SUV.  It has been a race to the finish.  No matter what, when the Japanese automaker decided to take the challenge, it seemed to have done a much better job.  First, Toyota introduced some expensive SUVs.  But now, adding the Sequoia to its stable, Toyota wants to offer its customers a vehicle they can afford.  Based on the success of the Tundra truck, Toyota engineered the Sequoia.

<b>Safety is important to me:  What's up with the Sequoia?</b>

Well, I am happy to report that it comes with dual front and side-impact air bags as standard.  Your passenger will also be protected in case there is a side-impact accident.  You can choose the option of getting installed on the passenger's side.  Well, for this amount of money, I hoped it came as a standard for both sides, considering that this can be a matter of life and death.  (Read my reviews of Toyota Corolla and see how these features saved my wife's and kids' lives)

<b>What are some of the features on the 2001 Toyota Sequoia SR5 4X4?</b>

The dealership employee reclined the second and third seat backs in case in case I wanted to travel with comfort.  

<b>Features</b>

* anti-lock brakes and anti-skid brakes.  The anti-ski brakes are fantastic in that they are applied to all wheels while the engine performance is reduced when a skid is detected..)

*  Traction control

*  The model that I test-drove was the Limited.  It comes with running boards, leather seats and all types of goodies for comfort.

The only thing, though is that the mileage is poor.  If you want reliability and comfort, go for this Sequoia.

Enjoy your drive!
