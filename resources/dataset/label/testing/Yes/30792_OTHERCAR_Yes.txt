            This is a great digital camera for almost everyone.  I bought this camera after using the Epson 500 digicam, Sony Mavica.  Granted the resolutions of those camera's are lower than the 1.3 megapixel of the D340R, their price was similar.  My other camera is a Canon Elph which uses Advantix film, the cost of which is significantly higher.  I use my D340R to take pictures of my one year old to date I have taken well over 400 pictures and on my third set of batteries (4 AA's).  I think my battery consumption is less than normal because I use the adapter (which you have to purchase separately) when downloading and deleting pictures and also I seldom use the view screen unless I suspect that the picture did not turn out well.  Downloading is via a serial port which is not too fast but the included software makes it very easy.  The D340R comes with a variety of features but I recommend that you play around and get comfortable with them before you use it as your main camera at special events.  There is a zoom, which is digital, meaning the zoom is not a lens zoom, it is a software zoom which in my mind is better done with software.  It took me quite a few photos to get used to judging distance of the subject as well as learning when to use the flash or not.  The only thing that really bothers me about this digital camera is that it takes about 5 seconds between shots which may seem like an eternity when trying to get that perfect picture from an active little baby.  All in all this camera is the best digital camera I've used, including the Sony Mavica 7 and the best priced in its' class.<br><br>
