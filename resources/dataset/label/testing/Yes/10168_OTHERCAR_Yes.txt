            The RX300 debuted 2 years ago and quickly became the hottest selling Lexus.  In NH my mother had to wait for a LONG time before she received this car and for the most part, I would say that it was worth the wait.  Because of the high demand for this car, it was difficult for my parents, or anyone to bargain at the dealer or on the Internet, so if you like to bargain for a great deal the RX300 is not the car for you.  If you won a Lexus the RX300 is the car they will likely to give you when you go for tune-ups or repairs.   

First Impression -  As some other reviewers had stated the RX300 feels a lot like a mini-van.  Specifically, the dash board feels a lot like a Toyota MiniVan (I forgot the name but the front of the car shaped like a bullet train).  There are LOTS of space in front of the driver.  The RX300 is a SUV so it is a bit taller.  At some 215 HP the RX300 is very quite, like all other Lexus cars (except for the new IS300).  

The Drive and the Interior - Driving this car feels a lot like driving my ES300.  The RX300, ES300 and the Camry all share the same chassis I heard so that may be the reason why.  The panels are very well laid out and easy to see.  A glance and you could easily see how fast you are going, the gas, etc etc.  On the right side of the driver's panel you will find a general display which will be used to operate the stereo, control temperature, and offering some interesting driving statistics such as average Miles Per Gallon (high Teens I believe for a mixed highway/local drive) and average speed.  The buttons are large and well laid out so I could easily manipulate the stereo without looking at my fingers once I get used to it.  As with other luxury cars the Lexus have auto temperature control.  The cup holders are very well laid out and does not interfere with anything else if you put cups in them.  The sun glass holder right about the driver is a neat touch.  The auto-dim rare view mirror could take you a little while to get used to if you have never used one before because everything appears to be darker.  My mother who is tiny (5ft) sometimes had problems with the big, square shaped side view mirror because it was so big that her vision was partially blocked, creating a blind spot to her left.  I am 5'10 and did not have that problem.  The sound system is excellent.
      
There appears to be a lot of room in the RX300.  We have no problem putting a 32'in TV and other stuff in the back.  The back seats 3 comfortably.  There is an air control duct in the arm rest for the people in the back seat, which is nice.                

Ice Driving and Rough Terrain's - Since my parents live in NH, we get snow often.  The RX300 works GREAT in snow as all SUVs should.  While testing driving the RX300 the dealer had my father going on a solid ice road and it did not slip at all.  From other reviewers (professional and normal) the RX300 does not fare well in real &quot;rugged&quot; terrain.  If you intend to drive this in the wild I don't think it is a good idea either, the Ford F150 pickup or a Ranger Rover is ideal for this sort of thing.

Reliability and value -  All Lexus cars SHOULD have excellent reliability.  The ES300 was rated to be the most reliable car by the Consumer Reports for a while.  Since the RX300 is pretty much an ES300 SUV in many ways I would expect the RX300 to last a long time, most likely to out live their competitors.  Lexus cars retain their value pretty well, not as well as Mercedes and BMW but right up there.  Even after years I would expect the RX300 to worth a lot.  

Service - The Lexus services are GREAT.  They charge you a lot but not as much as the German Car people.  Once you own the Lexus you gets to be treated like a King by the Lexus dealership people.  When your Lexus is in for repairs or tune ups you get to drive the RX300 for FREE for the duration!    

Competitors - The RX300 competes with the Mercedes' M-class SUVs, the new Acura SUV, the Infiniti Qx45, the Rover Discovery and a few others.  I have been in the Merc SUV before and I think it is a lot smaller than the RX300, and it costs a few thousand dollars more.  The Discovery is also very nice but then the ride was very stiff on normal roads.  The Discovery's reliability has also been questioned.  Overall the RX300 is cheaper than its European competitors but slightly more expansive than its Japanese competitors.     

Who should get this - The RX300 is not for everyone.  It doesn't have a &quot;roar&quot; which some people might want from their &quot;muscle&quot; SUVs.  The RX300 is not a &quot;muscle&quot; car by any means and you are not going to hear the engine &quot;roar&quot; with the RX300.  It is not intended to be driven in the wilderness and up a mountain.  It is however, intended for people who enjoys their sedans but prefer to be a little higher off the ground so they could get a better view and more room.  It is intended for people who wish to get from point A to point B in a quite and smooth ride even when they drive way up and over 90 MPH.  If you are one of these people (I know I am) then the RX300 is a great car.
