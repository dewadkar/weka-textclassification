              The Ford Ranger pickup truck has not changed tremendously in design since the inception of it's latest model in 1994.  I purchased my Ranger in late 1994, and now have 125,000 miles on it.  For the most part, it has been a very good, reliable truck, with the 4-cylinder, 2.3 (upgraded to a 2.5 in later models)liter engine that does a fair job for power and acceleration, if you don't expect to set land speed records.
  Ford appears do be doing a good job with regard to corrosion-proofing and quality of paint, if my truck is an example of their work.  The bright blue paint they used still looks as good as the day I bought the truck, and there is no evidence of rust anywhere on the vehicle. The interior and upholstery look very similar to the day I bought it also, with no tearing of cloth of vinyl, and minimal fading of colors in the fabric.
   The only major repair on the vehicle has been the transmission, which has needed to be rebuilt twice. Ford and Mazda share the same manual 5-speed transmission used in the Ranger and the B2300 series trucks.  Mazda, in an apparent stroke of superior engineering, chose to use steel plugs instead of rubber ones in three 1/2 inch holes on the upper part of the transmission which is unseen when the transmission is installed.  The first time my transmission failed was when the rubber plugs dry rotted, leaked, and caused my transmission to fail catastrophically midway through a 2,000 mile trip, stranding me in the middle of nowhere. One year later, two teeth broke off of the fifth gear of my new transmission, taking away my overdrive capability and costing another $500 in repairs.  Now, I do not trust this transmission at all,  and I check fluid level on it once weekly as a result of these failures.
    This is a good truck, and all components except the transmission have done very well over the course of 125,000 miles. if I had to do it over again, I'd go with the automatic transmission, though.
