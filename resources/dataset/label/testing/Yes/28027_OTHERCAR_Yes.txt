            As a 6'2&quot; male with a 4'11&quot; wife, I have a unique predicament when buying a new car.  We both have to be able to reach the pedals, and the ride has to be comfortable.  Being a father of 2, I also have to be sensible.  We wanted an economical car with a smooth ride, and all of the family perks.

I researched many other cars but found that the 2000 Neon had the room for our family, a high quality stereo system with 4 disk CD Changer, 6 speakers(2 woofers, 2 tweeters, and 2 mid-range), a great mileage rate, and plenty of trunk space.  These were all of the things that we were interested in besides the sleek look.

We have taken 3 750 mile trips, and a few other 6 hour journeys in the last 3 months since we purchased our car.  It is extremely comfortable, and has a smooth ride.  The cruise control console, is the best I have seen with it's nice large button interface at your fingertips, while you are holding the wheel.  The legroom in the front seats accomodate both a tall and a short driver.  

A feature I had almost forgot to mention, but must add is the lumbar support.  I have a terrible back, in fact some days, I can hardly walk.  This seat has a great lumbar support, and eases the pain and pressure off of my lower back.  Very comfortable.

The only difficulties/frustrations we have had at all with our Neon is that the mileage on the highway is much less than was claimed on the sticker.  We get about 24mpg on the highway and about 20mpg in the city.  The other hardship was that you cannot comfortably seat an adult, or teenager in the back.  There isn't enough leg room back there.

If you would like a nice car, that handles well, is inexpensive, and doesn't have many flaws, I suggest the Plymouth Neon 2000, while it lasts.<br><br>
