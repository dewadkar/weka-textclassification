            What an great car!  Never have I seen such a great array of power, luxury, and just sports car mixed together so well.  Driving on the hi-way in this car makes it feel almost like silence, the engine is so quiet.  And yet, it is a powerful car!  The only drawback I would have to say is the small trunk, which looks good but is not very functional.  I cannot even get a suit from the cleaners in their on my way back from work.  But in the scheme of things that is only a minor drawback.  I also like the sound system which is a very good idea to keep you up in the morning!  I haven't had to take this car to the shop, other than a tune-up yet, and I don't believe I will for a very long time.  This is definitely a good quality car, and I give it my full approval.<br><br>
