            You always have to be careful when you say &quot;new&quot; referring to a vehicle to avoid misinterpretation.  I had been driving a Mazda pickup for several years and had gotten tired of looking up at everything on the road.  I was also in the middle of several home improvement projects and could just never seem to haul everything I needed with the small payload of the little truck.  So one night I said to my wife that I wanted to buy a &quot;new&quot; truck.  

By &quot;new&quot;, I actually meant &quot;different&quot;.  I was thinking of a ten year old truck that I could just pay cash for and keep the Mazda, which was still in great condition and very reliable.  She, of course, interpreted &quot;new&quot; to mean &quot;new&quot;, and immediately dragged me off to the local Chevrolet dealership.  They had some beautiful trucks, but they were <i>way</i> more than I wanted to pay for one.  She quickly fell in love with one of them and started asking me every day to go over and buy it.

I came up with a plan on how I could get out of buying the truck without being the bad guy.  My credit union offers pre-approved auto loans by phone so I called them up and applied for a $26,000 loan, far more than the price of the truck.  At the time, I had a new (and large for my salary) mortgage and several other debts, so I figured that they would disapprove the loan.  That way I would get out of buying the truck and she would be mad at the bank instead of me.  Image my surprise when I got a telephone call two days later congratulating on my loan approval!

They sent me the check right away and I carried it around in my wallet for about six weeks.  Then one weekend, we were up in Maryland at my in-laws' house and we stopped by a Chevy dealer.  I made an offer on a truck that I thought was so ridiculously low that they would never take it, but they countered at $200 above my offer and we took the truck home at $100 above the offer.

<b>Ok, you want to know about the truck now, right?</b>

Of course you do, so here goes.  I bought a 1994 Chevrolet Silverado (C1500) pickup.  It was a beautiful two tone blue and silver with the full eight-foot bed.  It came equipped with the 5.7 liter (350 cubic inch) engine which is no longer available in the half-ton pickup.  

I hate traffic and this truck has the power to jump into any sized hole between cars when you come up the on ramp and nobody will move over to make room for you.  Incidentally, even though the 5.7 liter engine is no longer available, the new trucks have plenty of power as well.  My father has the 1999 Silverado and I believe that it may have even more pep than mine.

The truck is very durable.  After six years, there was no rust whatsoever and the paint looked almost as good as it did new.  The interior was also easy to maintain, and even though there were plenty of stains from my spills, there were no rips or snags in any the cloth seats, carpet, or any of the plastic trim inside the truck.

Chevrolet loads their trucks with features.  This one included power windows, power door locks, tilt wheel, and cruise control.  It had the split bench seat, which was excellent for me because it has plenty of seating room yet is easy to access the storage area behind the seat.  The full gauge package including speedometer, tachometer, oil pressure gauge, and temperature gauge was excellent.

The truck was very comfortable, rode as smoothly as most cars, and handled exceptionally well for a truck.  It was a pleasure to drive, even for long cross-country trips.

<b>What I like best about it.</b>

The thing I like best about the Chevrolet truck is its hauling capability.  While doing a masonry project I went to a local gravel and sand supply to purchase sand.  After loading the truck, I pulled onto their scale and was surprised to find that I had 4000 pounds of sand on my truck - yes, two tons on a half-ton pickup!  I won't say that I would do this again, but the truck had no problem pulling that load and even handled fairly well at low speeds with that much weight.

I also pulled a trailer with the truck frequently and it handled this task flawlessly as well.  In fact, if you plan to use a truck as a truck (vice just as a commuting vehicle) I don't think you will find a better one anywhere.

Warranty service is another big plus.  Even though the warranty is only three years or 36,000 miles which I feel is not the greatest, Chevrolet is very responsible at honoring their warranty obligations.  My brother's company truck, also a Chevy C1500, had severe transmission problems at 7000 miles and Chevrolet replaced the transmission no questions asked.

This truck is incredibly reliable.  In 106,000 I only had to make two repairs.  First was replacing a $30 brake line.  The other was replacing the windshield as a result of being hit by flying gravel on the highway.  That has no bearing on the reliability of the truck.

<b>The downside.</b>

At close to 100,000 miles the engine started using a little oil.  This was not really serious, about one quart between oil changes.  I've driven several vehicles that used far more oil than this so I know that it does not mean it is time for a new engine, but it does signal the beginning of the end.  At the same time, I bear some degree of responsibility for not always being incredibly prompt with oil changes.  Even though I chose to sell the truck at that point, it by no means was worn out.  My brother has driven four of his company Chevrolet trucks to near 200,000 miles without any serious problems.

Gas mileage can be a problem now that petroleum prices are so out of control.  The truck gets about 20 miles per gallon on the highway and 17 in city driving.  This was not a big problem when gas was a dollar a gallon, but today it would be very painful.

<b>Recommendation.</b>

If you need a reliable, capable, and very comfortable truck and are willing to pay a <i>premium</i> price, this truck is for you.  The new Chevrolet trucks are just as durable as ever and come loaded with far more features than my 94 model, but they are very expensive.
