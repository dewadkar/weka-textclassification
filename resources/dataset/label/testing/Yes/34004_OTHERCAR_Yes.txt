            My 96' Toyota Tacoma was the first vehicle that I had bought totally on my own.  I bought it when I was just graduating from college as a little gift to myself. Before that time, I had a lot of help from my father on a number of cars that got me through high school and most of my University travels.  This was the third Toyota that we had had in the family so I was quite familiar with the quality and performance. Hence, we had also owned a Toyota 4wd truck and an ancient Toyota Corolla that literally ran for over 200k miles without any major problems.  The Tacoma had a lot of the same spirit of our two previous vehicles, and more.

When I first got into the Tacoma at the lot, I was impressed with the comittment that Toyota had seemed to make to the new age of driver.  I had felt that into the 90's, the car manufacturers were finally getting their fingers on the pulse of what the &quot;new age&quot; car buyers wanted.  They wanted more power with more luxury available at a lower price.  This was realized by Toyota even in their truck models.  The Tacoma was basic in the amenities like most trucks are, but carried a lap of luxury that I had not had in my other trucks or lower valued cars.  The seats were comfortable and covered in cloth and the truck just fit the driver unlike some of the older big trucks that you had to climb up into a non-contoured basic set of seats.  The levers for the things like air conditioning and defrost and so on were well defined and user friendly and the rest of the interior had a flare that I had not seen on the drab trucks of old.

When I took the Tacoma on a test drive, I was dually impressed.  Toyota seemed to redefine the engines in their truck models to suit the needs of both a &quot;car&quot; driver while maintaining some of the torque that a truck surely needs.  The vehicle was very quick for a truck.  To this day, even though the Tacoma was a stick and my other trucks have been automatics, I still feel it was quicker than the two big Chevy trucks that I have owned since.  Its 16 valve engine could race you out of the starting gate with enough left over to haul the load up the mountains.  It was a remarkable engine.

The looks of course were very stylish.  I actually wasn't sure when the truck came out if I had liked the new look of the Toyota standard truck but it grew on me.  The Tacoma is much more aero dynamic then the earlier models and mimics the latest trend of making more contoured and futuristic looking vehicles.  If you look at it on the road, its really snazzy.

As far as reliability and durability, I think that Toyota needs no introduction.  I had told you earlier about my 200k mile Corolla and that is pretty much what I have heard from almost all owners about their Toyotas.  They just run and run and run.  I can't really comment on my specific vehicle because I had traded it in after a couple years for one of the two Big Chevy trucks that I was to own later.  You can read about those reviews if you like this one in the Chevy Silverado categories.  I wrote a review on the 99' Silverado and the 2001' Silverado that I currently own.  I must mention to all readers that I did not trade in my Tacoma because I didn't like it.  I simply just wanted more size.  At the time I wasn't really sure about the larger Toyota trucks like the Tundra and the now discontinued T100 because they were young in the market.

In conclusion, I must simply say that the Toyota Tacoma is a wonderful little vehicle.  It is stylish, runs well, is powerful for its size and makes you feel at home at the wheel.  If you don't mind paying a tad bit more then the domestic models and don't want a full-size model, this truck is for you.<br><br>
