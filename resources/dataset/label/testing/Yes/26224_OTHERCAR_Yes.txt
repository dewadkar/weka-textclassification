            Originally, I started out looking for cars to complement my 1998 Toyota 4Runner, and was settling down into the Audi/Mercedes/BMW camp.  As I got close to execution, I took a day to go and test drive the Audi, Mercedes, and the BMW 5 series one more time before I made the decision.  

As I pulled up to the dealer, I saw something out of the corner of my eye--the very first 2001 BMW X5 3.0 that had showed up at my local dealer.  After giving it a once over, I went and drove a 5 series (which wasn't too shabby).  When I was pulling it into the driveway, the X5 still was sitting there, begging me with its fine lines to take it for a spin.  So, I did.

And, when I took it for a spin, I was so impressed, I took it home to show the wife.  And, I've been driving an X5 ever since.

The first thing that I have to say is what I believe has been said elsewhere--this is not an SUV.  The X5 drives like no SUV that I have ever driven, its much closer to the 5 series that I had driven before it.  The X5 is sporting, torquy, and overall a very pleasant experience.

As there are many other articles on the X5 here, I thought I'd throw in a few toward the options that are available--which ones to get, and which ones to avoid.

1) Heated Seats--Funny, but I'd never had heated seats before.  The heated seat option is one I'd recommend... not only does it make the drive cozy, it also warms up faster than the overall car, making you warmer quicker.

2) Heated Steering Wheel--I have it, and its nice.  However, for the money, I'd forego it a second time.

3) GPS--Works great overall, the only time that it has failed me was when I was lost in NYC (that was not fun).   The downside to the GPS is that the computer that they've used to process is not the fastest in the world, and data entry is often very slow.  But, once the route is calculated, it does a superlative job.  I'd recommend it.

4) Rain sensor--The rain sensor works good, but its probably an unnecessary option.  I often will hit the windshield wiper up two notches, which sets it regular intermittent, and then have to &quot;reset&quot; it back to rain sensor mode.  So, I'd avoid this one.

4) Autodimming mirrors--very cool.  I had no idea that I needed these so much.  They have been great for those new types of headlights that have started to show up.

5) Sunshades for the back--I haven't really used these yet, but people play with them all the time.  They seem a little flimsy, so I'd probably not get them, unless you don't like those suction cup-attached sun shades.

With that said, I have about 7K miles on the vehicle, and its still running tight and smooth.  Its an excellent car (as you would expect from BMW), and well worth the money, especially with those great options!!!
