            I bought my '95 wagon to replace my '87 Acura Integra.  I was planning to do a lot of camping and the Integra just couldn't handle that sort of punishment.

I love the AWD.  I've driven this car on gravel, dirt, wet pavement, mud, hay-field and ice and have never gotten into trouble.  That's saying a lot, from someone who considers herself not the greatest driver on the planet.

I love the insurance rates I get with this car.  I'm currently paying $520/year, which is wonderful, and I could never hope to get that with the Toyota RAV-4 I was considering as an alternative to the Legacy.

What do I hate?  Not much.  I wish it got better mileage.  I can't seem to get more than 28 mpg, which is disappointing after the Acura.  Also, the gas gauge doesn't work.  I have a friend with the same car (same year, same options, just a different color) whose gauge doesn't work either.  I think it's a &quot;feature&quot; of this car.  I depend on the fuel light to work to know when I need gas.

It's a great car.  I would buy another Subaru product in an instant.  My brother bought himself an Impreza RS 2.5 based on what I thought of the Subaru line, and he loves his car.<br><br>
