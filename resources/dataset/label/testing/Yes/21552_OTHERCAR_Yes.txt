            I bought a large 4.1MP SLR digital camera, but realized that it was too bulky and too complicated for the whole family to use.  So, I ended up buying the S200 to take with me on trips.  The most important thing with photography is that if you don't carry the camera, your not getting any shots.  This camera is so small that it can fit in a pocket.

Don't let the size fool you.  The S200 takes wonderful photos and is very easy to use.  Canons generally have very user friendly buttons.  The flash control, display control, and basic functions are easy to use.  The durable stainless body is built to last.  The display screen is very bright and clear even in daylight.  

Some of the cons with the camera is it's price.  At about $250, it's a little high compared to some comparable 3.2 MP cameras.  If you only need 4x6 prints, then all you need is a 2MP.  I also don't like the proprietary battery and would of liked the camera to have the ability to use regular batteries.  This is specially important if travelling overseas.  I hate to carry the charger, a transformer, and a extra battery (which costs $49.00).  Low light photos are not the best without a flash, but with a flash they are fine.
