            I have a 1993 Jeep Wrangler.  She has 5 inches of lift and 33 inch tires.  I have my dream vehicle here!  I tear up the desert out here in Phoenix...  She goes anywhere I want.  

I can climb the biggest hills and crawl over the biggest rocks...  My husband has a chevy and I drive circles around him... 

My little Jeepy is SO pretty too. Nice and shiny red.  I get excited just talking about her!!!  

Being that I do live in Phoenix I only have the top on for about 30 days a year.  And there is nothing like having the wind blow through your hair, I even love it when, OOPS, I get caught out in the rain...  It is such a feeling of freedom :) I don't have to worry about the interior getting all wet cause it was made to... there are even drain holes on the floor.

My son just loves the jeep too... he has made me promise he can have her when he starts driving... I told him okay but I think I might have lied.  I can't help it... I never ever want to lose my Jeepy.  My dogs also love the Jeep.  I think they feel the same way as I do about the wind in their hair.

I also feel really safe in my Jeepy... With the big strong roll bars and all.

Drawbacks??? I really don't see any.  Sure it can be noisy on the freeway but I would never trade that for a top!!!  Plus anyways that is why I have a nice radio.  And okay because of all my lift the ride can be a little bumpy, but Jeepy more then makes up for it while we are 4 wheelin.  And as for climbing up into her... that is why I have nerf bars and long legs :)  And actually driving her takes some time to learn... But I have never been afraid of how she handles... I know what she can do and I drive her responsibly

Oh wait I do have a drawback... My husband!!!  He always wants to borrow her!  That is so annoying!  Like I wanna trade my Jeepy for his stupid truck.

And for all those people who think that I am crazy....  It's a Jeep thing you wouldn't understand!  I think it has to be in your blood or something.
