            That little Polaroid PDC 700 is the sweetest thing!  I bought mine a year ago at WalMart for $220 and I take it everywhere I go.  It fits neatly into my purse right next to the cell phone.  It is lightweight and small enough to carry around all day, even when shopping.

I am an interior designer and love to take photos of my work for my portfolio.  This little camera is my most reliable sidekick.  I bought extra media for it, but have never used it because I can shoot about 24 photos before I have to download.  I love having it with me because I can get from a job site to the computer in my office, download photos, email them to a client, or print them off onto glossy paper for show and tell.

  My long distance clients really appreciate being able to see the progress of their new homes on a day to day basis by email or on a website.  They can just get online and see photos of  the window treatments we just installed or how that rug looks with the wallpaper in the dining room.  How convenient is that? 

 I also make designer pillows and sell them in boutiques in Aspen.  When I complete a new line, I do a photo session, upload them onto a website and wait for my retail clients to email me their orders.  The owners of one of the stores even asked me to build a website for their store because they were so impressed with the photos on my website. 

 This little camera has more than paid for itself many times over.  It has certainly made me look good in business.  Pictures say so much more than words and the PDC 700 tells it like it is.  

This has to be one of the best cameras out there for novices like me.  I love to take photos, and am definitely not a  professional in that area, but the PDC 700 makes me look pretty darn good.  

Owning this camera has set me free forever from filling out those envelopes at WalMart and waiting for my pictures to to be processed.  WalMart used to let me order a CD only without buying the actual prints.  They allowed me to do that two times, then they made a new rule that you can't get the CD unless you get the prints.  NO!!!  I want to edit my own photos.

 I have saved enough money to pay for another camera by not having to buy film or processed prints.  I take hundreds of photos and I can store all of them, the good, bad, and ugly on CD's with my CD writer. My office is small without a lot of storage space for photos on paper, so the CD's save room and make it easy to catalog the photos.

 I don't even use my scanner any more since I bought this camera.  My old scanner won't work with my new computer and I don't even care because I no longer need it.  Don't have to wait for the scanner to warm up, don't have to wait for Walmart, don't have to pay for photos I don't want (like that one of the inside of my purse!).  Thanks, Polaroid for setting me free!  

Since I am only an amateur photographer, I did not want to invest in a camera with lots of gadgets that I would never use. I would only throw the camera in a drawer and never us it.  You should know by now that I am not a techie. I am one of those people who just wants shoot something without having to read all those time-consuming instructions...just gimme it and let me see some results!

This camera is so easy to use, you can spend your precious time pointing and shooting instead of trying to make sense of all the technical gobbley-goo.  It only takes a minute to hook the camera cable to your computer, plug into a power source, install the software from the CD and you are ready to see your photos.

  It's digital cameras for dummies!  Maybe you are not camera-impaired like I am, so get yourself one with all the trimmings that requires a college degree to operate.  I  know that there are a lot of people who write outstanding reviews here and critique every little technical detail, but I am not that smart or that interested.  I don't have  an ivy-league education and don't know all the techie buzzwords, but I do know how to have fun and make money with a simple, easy to use camera.

I live in the Rocky Mountains where the scenery is magnificent and the wildlife abundant.  I love having my PDC 700 handy when those bighorn sheep show up to graze in the meadows or when or when the sunset puts on a breathtaking show in the afternoons.  There is no optical zoom on the PDC, but nobody is perfect and love is blind.  I like this camera so much that I don't even mind if it eats batteries as fast as you can shove them in there.  

My PDC 700 has always lived up to my expectations.  I turn on the LCD (oink, oink) and it lets me see the shot I just took and gives me a chance to delete it immediately if I don't like it.  I can turn off the LCD if I want to save batteries and even  program it to shut itself down when I forget to turn it off.   

Another great thing about this camera is the ease of downloading right into Photoshop 5.5 or any photo editor.  I can edit my photos right there and send them email or publish them on the web.  I like to use Photoshop because I am familiar with it, but the  camera itself comes with some wonderful software with lots of options. You don't have to know Photoshop or any of the photo editors. You can crop, size, rotate, morph, email, almost anything you want to do with a photo by just using the software that comes with your camera.  This little darlin' lets you to have more fun than he law allows.  

Now that I have learned a little bit about digital cameras by using the PDC 700, I will probably purchase another camera with more features like optical zoom and higher resolution.  But this one will always be my first love. 

 I am a bit careless about dropping things and don't always pay attention to my surroundings.  I have dropped this camera from my coat pocket onto the sidewalk and it still works!!!  That is a miracle in itself.  I don't recommend abusing your favorite things, but this one took a real beating.  I will have to add durability to my list of pros.      

If you don't want to invest a lot of money in a digital camera until you learn more about them, then this is a great camera for you.  After using the PDC 700 to get some experience, you can always hand it down to your kids or a friend and get yourself something a little more sophisticated.  I am keeping mine just because it is so easy to use and I couldn't bear to part with it. 

PDC 700.... I love everything about you!
