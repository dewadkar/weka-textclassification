            Nissan Trucks are not the greatest trucks for four wheeling but they 
are very reliable.  My dad has an 85 truck which has 270,000 miles on it
and it is still running.  The engine isn't too powerful but it is still
running.  I like Nissan for it's well made insides but for the outsides
they aren't the best cars.  The outsides seem kind of flimsy.  Usually
the motor usually outlasts the body.  The body usually needs repairing 
before the motor.  My car makes noises in the shocks but it is still
strong in the motor.  The trucks shocks are pretty much shot but it keeps
going and going.  I can recommend Nissan because my family owns three all
with over 45,000 miles on them and about one trip to the repair shop outside
of tune ups.<br><br>
