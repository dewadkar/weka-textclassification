            The all new impala has to be one of excuse me the best car on the market today!  I love this car it is roomy, luxurious, sporty, it is an absolute dream. I fell in love with it when I first laid eyes on it.  I love everything about it, I don't believe there is one single thing that I don't like. My previous car was the Chevrolet Lumina and I really liked that car until I bought this one. I purchased the LS, now in the base sedan I don't think there are very many options and if you do get any of them you might as well get the LS. I feel this is a whole lot of car for the price. It handles great it is quiet, I also purchased the leather package I love the radio controls on the steering wheel, some people feel they would not be able to look at the road and change channels at the same time, quite the oppisite, it is right at your fingertips and it is second nature to just push the button to change a channel. I also love the heated seats on a cold morning and if I forget to turn them off it turns itself off. It also has the manual lumbar support so when my back hurts I just pump the seat up and I feel great. This car is a womans car, it will tell you when to change your oil, when to fill up your washer fluid, if your tire pressure is low, I'm telling you this is a great car! I got a fully loaded car the only thing mine doesn't have is the sunroof. My price was only 23,179 and for the price you cannot beat this car. I would recommend this to ANYONE interested in a new car, just test drive it for yourself you will see what all the talk is about.
