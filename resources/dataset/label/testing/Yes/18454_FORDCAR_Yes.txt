            Told the dealer that I wanted a small six cylinder truck to go hunting and fishing off road, nothing fancy, just reliable and tough.  The rain forests and secluded beaches of Maui are beautiful, if you can get there. My stock Ranger XLT, 4wd proved to be just what I needed.  I have already taken it to several places where stock 4wd's have not gone before, mainly straight up the back slopes of Haleakala.  This truck has a great crawl gear right from the factory.  Happy trail blazing Ford style.<br><br>
