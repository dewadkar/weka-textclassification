            I bought this from Fry's electronics store.  I choose this over others because I didn't want a big bulky camera like some of the ones that are on the marketThis is one of the best digital cameras you can buy. It comes with all the gadgets and features with high quality resolution you can even zoom into your pictures to see them in greater detail.  It's also really easy to view your pictures too. You can see them instantly on the screen! If your looking to head on into the 21st century, do it in style with this sleek little number. I use it all the time to put my pictures on the internet and save them conveintly in computer folders rather then the unorganized shoebox method.  E-mail pictures to far-away friends and relatives too. Picture quality is exellent with full color screen display. I love this camera.  I didn't even need to read the handbook that came with it, I just got started. You can put your pictures on your computer by a little chip that you insert in the camere and place into a floppy disk adaptor or hook it up to your computer with a cable. Have fun.<br><br>
