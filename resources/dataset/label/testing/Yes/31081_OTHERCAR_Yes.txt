            I have owned my Tundra since being purchased brand new by myself in April of 2000. I have the 2wd, v8 , automatic,Sr5 access cab, 17" factory  rims,factory bedliner, cloth interior. I have over 62k miles on my truck now. I love the power of the v8 . Its seemless and has plenty of power on tap if you need it. The trans shifts crisp and with authority.  The truck is tight as can be suspension wise. It has minimal body roll and is tight and shimmyless going down the highway at speeds of up to 80 mph even after 3 years. I just had my first brake job at 61k miles. Unfortunately for me I started to detect a pulsing feeling in my brakes around 50k miles. No squeals or metal to metal sounds just mild pulsing when applying the brakes felt through the pedal. Well it turned out my original rotors were shot and out of warranty !!!! They had to be replaced. Also a check engine light came on at around 50k miles. It turned out two of the four oxygen sensors on the truck were sending trouble codes to the engine computer. My repair bill on the 3 year old truck, 60k miles  was just under 800 dollars for the two new oxygen sensors and two new front rotors and brake pads. The back pads at 60k miles I was told had 40% of their  pad life left. This was kind of disheartening in that I thought the rotors should of been covered under warranty --- remember they were the original rotors and had never been turned. My air conditioner would go through spells where it would work fine then would intermittently stop cooling properly. The air would feel moist and the air not as cool as it should of been. When I took it to the dealer they told me I probably had some sort of internal debris in the  a.c. system and I would need to have 500   dollars worth of "non warranty"  repairs to replace the expansion valve, system filter, disharge and charge the system  etc.???? This was on a two and a half year old truck !!!! I told them forget it !!!!! I went to the auto parts store and bought an ac  recharge kit. I charged it myself and it has been 100% o.k. since then. ??? The only other major flaw has been with the paint. I have the stellar blue pearl color.  I had a bird poop on the hood after 3 weeks of ownership and it ate through the clear coat on my hood the size of a baseball overnight. I was told by friends the e.p.a. made all car manufacturers take the harsh chemicals out of the auto paint that makes the paint resilient etc.  and thats probably why it ate through the clear coat. My Tundra paint is also easily scratchable. In Florida love bugs ate through my hood paint in several small chips on the leading edge of the hood.....I quickly had to buy a bug deflector to save my  hoods paint. The only other small bug is in the doors. They will not stay open on an incline. I cant tell you how many times I  have been hit in the back of the head by the doors when parked on a hill or decline.
