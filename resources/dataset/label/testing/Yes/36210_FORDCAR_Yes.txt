            Drove one of these for several weeks in an extended assignment in the U.K. earlier this year, and was pleasantly surprised.  I don't generally like small cars, but in Europe this is actually considered a 'full-size' model, and with good reason.  It is a lot more roomy on the inside than one would think -- and on the British Motorways, where the de facto speed limit is somewhere in the 85-mph range, it more than held its own against the European and Japanese pseudo-luxury cars.  Out of its league against the Jags and Porsches and Mercedes, granted, but it also doesn't carry the price tags those models do.  I had the Ghia model, which unfortunately isn't imported here in the U.S.A. yet, but the American 'wagon' model is the same size.  If I was in the market for a utilitarian family vehicle, this would be one of my first choices.  Even the styling, which I've heard puts some people off, is a refreshing change from the ubiquitous look-alike Japanese cars.
