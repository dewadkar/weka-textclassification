            My dad recently got a new GMC Jimmy, a car that my grandfather has had for a few years now.  I got home from college to see the new car and immediately liked riding in it.  It fit all of my end of the year luggage from school and i was totally comfortable in the back seat. 
  A few days went by and I started work at the same place as my dad, so he drove me in.  I was going to take the car home, so my dad told em he wanted me to drive the car to work so he could make sure that I could drive it without a problem.  I could definitely drive the car, but it was a little too big for me.  I am only 5'2&quot; and I was overwhelmed by the size of the vehicle.  It drove very smoothly, but the size was just way to big for me.  I didn't enjoy being so high off the ground and so much higher than the cars around me.  It actually scared me to drive the car.
  But, I still like the car very much.  I just don't like to drive it (and I don't have to worry too much about doing that...my dad is very protective of it), but I love riding as a passenger in it.  Its a great family car, very roomy.  I would definitely recommend this car to any people looking for a family vehicle.  
   I especially like the &quot;trunk&quot; space.  Its very large and since the back seats fold down, there is a ton of room for whatever you need.  My dad and I went to the bulk food store and picked up about 10 different items before we went into the hardware store to buy 200 lbs of cement and a wheel barrel.  We put the seats down and quickly loaded the back with plenty of room to spare.  I was very impressed.
  So overall I like the car, just not for myself.  I would recommend this car to any family, at least one with a driver taller than me!  <br><br>
