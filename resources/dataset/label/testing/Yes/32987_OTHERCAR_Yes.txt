            My wife and I decided to buy the 1997 Camry as it was the opposite of the car we traded in, a 1993 Mercury Sable LS.  The Camry is quiet at 75 mph, smooth riding, and most of all, reliable. 
 The 2.2 engine is perky enough for us and gets 26 mpg in town and over 30 on the highway.  With 47k miles, it has never let us down.  It is a very easy vehicle to drive and it almost hypnotizes me to sleep as it effortlessly does its duties as a car.
  The drivers seat isn't the most comfortable and I'd rank it as a 7 out of 10.  We plan to keep this car for years.  The Camry is sort of vanilla in taste, it neither offends or really turns on people.  People who like personality in their cars would probably not care for this car.  On the other hand, if you don't have a lot of mechanical know-how, this car is about as reliable as you can buy, kind of a Maytag washer of the car world, going on and on...my mechanic states that Accords and Camrys are without doubt the best built and most reliable cars for the money today.
  They do cost more up front, but they are cheaper to run from that point on. Hope this note helps your decision to buy.  Best wishes.<br><br>
