            In late 2000, when my 1989 Toyota Celica started to die, I began the search for my new car.  My prerequisites?  Compact car, good ride, good warranty, and overall value.  We had recently splurged on a 2000 Toyota Camry, and while we love that car, I was not willing to spend Camry-type money on a car that would be my workhorse in commutes ind business trips.  

I also wanted a car that looked nice, and had some good bells and whistles, like power everything, cruise control, and a CD player.  While I love Toyotas, I knew that those extra bells and whistles would cost too much.

Then along came the Hyundai.  The reviews on the 2001 Hyundai Elantra were quite remarkable, with most reviewers saying that it was better than the Toyota Corolla (my first choice).  The 2001 Elantra was newly redesigned, and the warranty could not be surpassed.

I was skeptical, until I took the car for a test drive.  It took corners better than my Celica had, and its shocks -- instead of struts -- made for a smooth ride over bumpy terrain.

When it came time to negotiate, I was able to purchase the car for less than invoice, with the help of edmunds.com.  Edmunds showed me the rebates available on the car, including a $500 manufacturer rebate at the time I was looking to buy.  Armed with the invoice price of every piece of optional equipment I sought to include on the car, the dealer soon agreed to my asking price.  In this economy, the car buyer is king.

Real world driving of the Elantra is even better than the test drive.  It is a very quiet car, even at high speeds.  Acceleration is decent for an automatic, but it is my understanding that the car is even better as a 5 speed.  The climate control on the air conditioner is good, maybe even a little too cold for my tastes at times.  There is plenty of leg room in front and back, comfortably seating four tall men.  The stereo system is good, and the optional CD player is a nice addition.  While the cruise control is difficult to figure out (without reading the manual), it is easy to program while driving.

My only two critiques of the car are the front seats and the trunk.  The front seats are narrower than other foreign cars, and the seatbelt is positioned irregularly, making it difficult to fasten while driving (which, of course, you shouldn't do anyway).  My ample hips fit snugly in the bucket seats up front, but not uncomfortably.

The trunk is a little too narrow, and the trunk cover is made of cheap materials.  This is surprising on a car which is very well made otherwise.

All in all, this is a great car.  It is also a great looking car, which adds to its appeal.  Although the resale value of it is questionable, for anyone looking to own a car for the long haul, it's a great deal.
