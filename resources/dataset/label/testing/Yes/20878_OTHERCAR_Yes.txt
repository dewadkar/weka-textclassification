            These days there are too few things unleashed on the American public that make you feel good. Feeling good about something, in my opinion, is important, so I have to say something when I run across one. The PT Cruiser is just such an animal. The closer I got to it, the better I felt and, whether driving it or riding in it, doesn�t seem to alter the rush much. It is just flat-out NICE!

Chrysler has come up with some pretty nice rides in recent years � especially appealing to those who want to try something new and different or maybe just want to feel good about �buying American�. For now, let�s just forget about all the hype of who makes it, engineering specs (which get pretty boring to the fun-lovers), performance specs (speed kills, anyway), yada, yada, yada... and just get down to the sensory reactions to a really nice, little ride. Okay?

This car turns your head. Oh yeah. Attractive � takes you back to the old days � a feeling of nostalgia just makes you want to get inside. Too bad for the young folks who don�t remember the days of the �identity� cars � the chopped, the channeled, the woodies � the fun cars. This ride takes you back  - but still gives you all the nice stuff of the new cars! The colors are captivating! Some like the blue, others like the silver � my favorite is the TAUPE! The finish is beautiful, deep, smooth...The chrome is heavy and old-style. The body feels like quality when you get in. Shutting the door is like shutting the door of an old �55 Caddy! SOLID!

Rich feel to the interior fabrics. Leather available if you want it. Moon roof available if you want it. The stereo is state of the art. Leather trim, efficient A/C, adequate head room...all the good-guy stuff.

Very important � women (in general) LOVE this car! They love to drive it, own it, ride in it! Easy to park, pack, wash, and fill the tank (mileage). The trunk space handles groceries and all packages like a breeze! With the rear seats completely removed (which is a simple, 1-step do � for anyone) you can put strollers, pets, sports equipment, etc. etc. in and go!

I have a friend who�s 6�-2�, 225 with bad knees � and loves getting in and out of this car! Amazing�

This is not a SPORTS car. You will not drag race here. Who cares? If it�s speed you want, forget it � but if you want class, you�ll have as much as the $50K competition for less than half the price. The demand right now for this car exceeds the supply. Pricing is a little �tweaked� - but it will stabilize. Wait out the production lag, pick out the one you really want, buy it, and start having fun driving with pride again!
