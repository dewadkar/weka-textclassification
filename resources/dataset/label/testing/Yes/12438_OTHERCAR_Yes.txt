            I originally wanted a Golf, but I wanted a VR6, and the ones that were in my budget were all 5-speads...and I'm pretty much an Auto only guy.  So I ran accross the Passat by accident when looking for a Golf.  At first I was skeptical about buying a station wagon, but after giving it a spin, I got over that rather quickly.  While the VR6 isn't quite as quick as some of the newer V6's out there nowadays it is definately a great engine.  This is my first car that is what I would call loaded, and I am very impressed.  The leather is very nice, and some of the VW courtesy features it has a very handy (ie..the locking mechanism that rolls down all the windows, as seen in latest VW commercials).  This car also has to be one of the roomiest vehicles I've ever had the pleasure of sitting in.  Being 6'6&quot; and 300lbs, I don't often get to have the cars I want, as I generally have to &quot;try them on&quot;.  This car meets and exceeds in headroom, legroom, hiproom, backseat room, cargo room (much larger than the new BMW 3 series wagons), and flat exterior storage (We tied a king bed to the top and put both twin boxsprings in the back.  I am also quite impressed with the amount of aftermarket products for this vehicle.  While not quite as many products for the B4 Passats as the B5s, there's still an amazing selection.  Including a supercharger ($3K) to get you upto 250bhp.  My only complaint so far would be finding tires for this car.  It has an awkward stock tire size that isn't carried very many places, and the stock tires from what I can tell have been discontinued.  I did manage to find some Pirelli P4000s that are great right now, and much more gripping than the stock Goodyears.  Overall I would definately recommend this vehicle.  Oh yeah, and since it's a wagon, it's almost invisible to cops, which has been quite the added bonus, especially since it's a rather fast car.<br><br>
