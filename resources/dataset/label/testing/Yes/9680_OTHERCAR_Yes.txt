            I have owned my 1998 4x4 Dodge Ram 2500 with the ISB 24Valve Turbo Diesel now for just over a year.  This vehicle is by far the pinnacle of Pickup Truck superiority.  The 24 Valve Diesel packs enough punch and power to get out of ANY situation.  The SLT interior is roomy and comfortable.  The all round quality of the vehicle is rugged and reliable.  If you are looking for a powerhouse, joined with comfort, this truck is for you.  If you don't like engine noise, the diesel is probably not for you.  When going through a drive thru, you may need to turn off the engine to hear the speaker!  I like this, so it is not a problem for me.  (LOUD PIPES SAVE LIVES!)  Driving this vehicle is like a dream.  It would be difficult for a pick-up truck lover to not fall head-over-heels after just one test drive.  Unfortunately, if you want the Quad or Extended Cab, be prepared to fork over some cash.  I have the standard cab, and I am completely pleased with it.  <br><br>
