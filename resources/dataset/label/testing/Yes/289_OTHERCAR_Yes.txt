            In 1992 I was looking for a Honda Civic wagon to replace my last one and found out that they weren't being imported anymore. I looked across the street  at the Mitsubishi dealership and saw a row of Expo LRV's that looked like the next best thing. I did some investigating and found that this car was also sold as an Eagle Summit Wagon and a Dodge Colt Vista Wagon so I went hunting for the best deal.

A local Eagle dealer had one left, a base model and seemed anxious to be rid of it. It seemed obvious that this was a niche car that hadn't yet found its niche. It was classified as a wagon although it looks more like a micro-van. The price was right and the test drive was fun. Even with the base 1.8L 4-cyl engine and 5-spd. this puppy zipped right along  and seemed fairly agile for a tall car. I have gotten an average of 29 MPG throughout its life to.

Up until the winter of 1999-2000 this car was a dream. No major repairs or fixes necessary up until then (about 108,000 mi.). Then my onboard engine computer died (in traffic) without warning and it was a *very* expensive fix and it hasn't run as smoothly since. My automatic shoulder belt ceased working right after and I was quoted $900+ for repair so I just left it as is and tightened my seat belt. the transmission is getting balky and it's getting obvious that it would take a major investment to get this car up to snuff again.

Which is something I would do *if* it had AC, but it doesn't and since I have moved to the south it has been a tough ride in the summers. But  this car exceeded my expectations. I expected a minor league Honda and up until these recent issues it has performed flawlessly. Great solo or with up to four adults, lots of room in the back, plenty of zip and god gas mileage and unique styling that makes it easy to find in any parking lot.

I will be trading it in soon for a mini-SUV, probably a CR-V. I have grown quite fond of sitting up higher than a sedan for several reasons including ease of entry and a better view of the roadway. I hoped it would have lasted longer, I usually got 170,000+ out of the Hondas I used to have. then again it was under 10K brand new and even in 1992 that was inexpensive.

this vehicle served as a sort of a prototype for the Chrysler PT Cruiser, at least on the inside. It was a good design that couldn't find its place and few were bought. Still it has served me well and I feel like I got my money's worth out of it.<br><br>
