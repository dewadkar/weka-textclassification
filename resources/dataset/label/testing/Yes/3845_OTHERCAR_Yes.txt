            I bought my Achieva new in 1993... Had only 50 miles on it.

At the time I thought I wanted a Grand Am, that is until I drove one.
I was not impressed.  So I looked at the Buick Skylark.  The drive on that one was ok, but I did not like the body style.  The Achieva drove great, handled well and had a body style that appealed to me.

Not only was it a nice looking car, and it handled great, but the price was right!  At the time, I paid $13500 (can't find new cars today for that price).....  It had a Bumper to Bumper warranty too.

Until the Achieva, I had a habit of trading in about every 2.5 years...
I know, foolish me.  After 3 years of driving the car I realized I had no desire to get a new vehicle.  It was great!  Performed well, even with a 4 cylinder engine, and got GREAT gas mileage.  I kept the car until last December when I gave it to my son.  Yes, he is still driving the vehicle and says he plans to keep it at least 2 more years.  Since it is still in the family, I get to drive my baby occasionally (just to make sure all is ok with the car, you know) :) 

It still runs great.  Gas mileage is wonderful.  No payments.

OK, the downside.  I purchased a white car with the bumpers white also.
The paint on the rear bumper has peeled twice.  The first time, after many discussions with the dealer, they repainted the bumper.  That lasted about 4 months before it started peeling again.  The dealer was such a pain, I decided I would live with the peeling bumper.  No sweat to me.

The other problem I experienced was the Head Gasket.  It blew.  Yep, went kapoot.  I took the car to the dealer I purchased it from and after many discouraging discussions, I towed the vehicle to a dealer in a larger town.  This story had a happy ending.  The gasket and repair was covered 100% by Oldsmobile!!!  Needless to say I was a very happy camper.

Would I recommend this car to others?  You Bet!!!!
I bought it the first year it was on the market.  Usually the year they work the bugs out.  So I would guess that the car is as good as (if not better than) my old model.
