            When I graduated from college I wanted to treat myself to a nice car. I loved the newly designed Eclipse and all it took was one test drive.

The difference between the GS and the GST was huge. The turbo (GST was my pick) 4 cylinder was so fast. I could get the sucker up to 130 mph with room to go (I got scared and backed off). It seemed the faster the car went the more it hugged the ground.

The sound system rocked with the Infinity CD system. All it needed was a little bass to complete the package. Unfortunately that left little room in the hatch back for not much more. The cockpit was comfortable enough, but did not haul around passengers too often. As for reliability, I had very few problems.

Unfortunately I soon needed a larger vehicle, but it was time to grow up I guess. After 3 years and 69,000 miles I had to give it up.
