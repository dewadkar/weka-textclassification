            The Jeep Cherokee, manufactured by Chrysler Motors, is a very well designed, good looking, and fun vehicle. The Jeep Cherokee is a relatively small vehicle, but don�t let its size fool you. I own a 1989 Jeep Cherokee Pioneer. I purchased the vehicle a couple of years ago because of its relatively low miles (49,000), and the fact that it had four wheel drive and a rather large engine. Unfortunately, the engine in my Cherokee was a bit to powerful for the small P195/70/15 Grand Am tires that were on it. Needless to say, I couldn�t get up a dirt hill because the torque of the vehicle would spin the tires too much to grip and move.
The 2000 Cherokee's thankfully come with P225/75/15 size tires, so you will not have this problem. If you are looking for a 4x4 at a relatively low cost, then the Cherokee is definitely a great bang for buck deal. Priced at about 19,000 dollars, you get a comfortably fitted 4 passenger vehicle with a snug 5 passenger capability. The four wheel drive on the Cherokee is very nice and will get you through just about any mess. The cargo space in the back is decent without the spare tire in there, but otherwise, it gets a little cramped. I would not recommend taking a carload of skiers for a 3 hour drive to the mountains with gear and all, it gets a bit uncomfortable(i have done it, so it is possible).The marvelous thing about Cherokees are that you can modify them into four wheeling beasts!!! I have currently put about 2500 into my vehicle in order to make it a great little rock crawler, mud bogger, and hill climber. I have lifted it 6 inches (http://www.tomken.com/cgi-tomken/tomken.cgi) and now have 32 inch BFG All-Terrains. The lift on the Cherokee�s are rather simple and inexpensive. There are also many other companies that manufacture products such as roof rack, brush guards, and nerf bars to make your Cherokee an off road machine. The advantage of a Cherokee over a wrangler is that you have a much smoother ride because of the extended wheelbase. I have driven wranglers, and they are just not a smooth ride on the road. Cherokees are also great vehicles if you just need to commute to work in an area where you will commonly need 4 wheel drive. I use my 4 wheel drive probably 50% of the time i drive my vehicle just because of the frequent snowfalls and off-roading. Cherokees perform off-road very well. They have a decent amount of articulation from the factory, and can have a significant amount more with modifications. Cherokees have rather small interiors and there isn�t much room between the front seats and the back seat, but definitely enough to fit small adults and children. Another thing that I am happy about is how well the Cherokee performs in an accident. Yes, I have crashed mine (not my fault mind you). In my accident the other car made a left turn in front of me resulting in me hitting on the front right corner of my car at about 40 mph. The vehicle sustained a decent amount of damage, but all persons in the car were fine...just minor whiplash. With the 2000 Cherokees you also have shoulder straps in the back seats which was added to the Cherokee family in or around 1991.
The 2.5 liter engine is definitely not the way to go if you are going to purchase a Cherokee. WAIT FOR OR BUY A 4.0 Liter!!!! It is pointless to have a four wheel drive vehicle if you don�t have the power to turn all four wheels. The Cherokee has a rather low center of gravity making it a good car for teens and great for those situations when you need to swerve out of the way of a deer or other debris on the roadways today. I love almost every aspect of my vehicle, except for its age. When Chryslers get old or high miles, they tend to break a whole lot. The engines run great up until about 110,000 miles or 10 years of age, then they rapidly fall apart. I have invested about 1500 into fixing the engine in the past year. Fortunately, the engine is much more powerful than the current competition of the Chevy Blazer, GMC Jimmy, and Toyota 4-Runner. It is also much cheaper with the Blazer and Jimmy running at about 25 - 29,000, and the Toyota 4-Runner at 40,000. It is definitely the best choice in its class.
Overall the Jeep Cherokee would make a great first car for your teen, a great off-roaders vehicle, or a great get the kids to school car. Its safe, reliable, and powerful enough to haul those jet skis or ATV's up a mountain pass.
