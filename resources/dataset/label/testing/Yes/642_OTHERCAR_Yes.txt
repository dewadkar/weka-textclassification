            I bought this camera when I caught a good deal for it online-- on sale for $579.  This was to be an upgrade from my Kodak 210+.

First things first--- ditch the cord connection.  Card readers can be purchased for about $30, and make photo transfer to computer so much easier.

The 8 megs standard memory is kind of small, and holds only about 16 larger (higher quality) pictures.  This was kind of dissapointing.  I bought a spare 16 meg card, and between the two I can hold enough pictures for most trips.

I also found the owners manual to be pretty terrible, doesn't explain the funtions well.  And there is a lot to learn on this camera, I haven't figured out all the features yet.  Onboard picture review and delete is easy to use, and you can even zoom in on the view box to see close-ups of pictures you have just taken (make sure her eyes were open when the photo snapped!).  The swivel base allows you to turn the camera to face you--- take self pics at arms length and see the viewfinder LCD screen at the same time (yes, I did a lot of this!)  The pictures, at high resolution, come out so huge that you can print an 11 by 14 photo on the printer (or uploaded to a site like ofoto.com that prints pictures for you) at good quality.

 I have taken pictures in the dark with this camera, the flash makes it as good as light out.  The battery life lasts about 60 shots, recharging batteries are a good idea.

I just packed up my camera and sent it in for repair--- dropped it on the floor and it did not survive the 3-foot fall onto tile.  :(  Error messages came up on the viewfinder.  I was quite upset.  I hope that it will be covered under the warantee, but I am not sure.  There are no local dealers that will repair it, and I am hoping it will not take forever to come back to me.  Handle with care!

Updated to say:  I mailed the camera off certified so that I would get the little green card back when the package arrived... I got the CAMERA back before the card!  They were super-fast with repair, and covered it under warantee, no charge!  The camera is working fine again and I am a little more careful with it now.  ;)  They cleaned the lens up for me and everything, too.  The warantee info said it would take up to six weeks, so I am pleased with the customer service aspect of the coverage.<br><br>
