            Two years ago my family decided that it was time to get rid of our ailing 1990 Caravan. The odometer read 150K+ and the tranny had been replaced 3 times. We stopped by the Dodge dealership, and my dad decided that a forest green LE was the one for us. We've got the 3.8L V6, premium sound, trailer-hitch, power everything, roof rack...everything except back A/C I think. Oh and no spoiler. I'll hold my rant on that till later.

Let me explain some things about me and minivans. I <b>hate</b> minivans with a passion - they're all slow boats. My family is a family of seven altogether, which means we really don't have any other choice when it comes to a vehicle that can handle all of us. The minivan is my mom's car to drive. I feel sorry for her. I drive a black Pontiac Bonneville and my dad drives a black 2000 Lexus ES300. Before she had the old minivan she used to have a Pontiac Firebird. Now she's stuck with a soccer-mom-mobile.

<b>Exterior</b>
It's forest green. Looks just like any other of the billion Caravans out there. We do have 16-inch rims on it, which makes it look at little better than the run-of-the-mill Caravan. I personally think Chrysler's minivan styling is the best out there, but that's a matter of opinion.

<b>Interior</b>
Very comfy. I applaud Chrysler on doing a great job with managing the space inside. Oodles of cupholders and little nooks and crannies to put stuff in. We have the premium sound which I would recommend getting if you listen to music at all inside your minivan. The overhead console has a cool little trip-counter, compass, fuel economy gage, and a bunch of other stuff. The ride is smooth, not truck-like, but much like a car�s: a lot better than a lot of other minivans out there. I�d say this is the minivan�s selling point: A much better ride than any of its competitors.

<b>Performance</b>
A minivan is simply a glorified truck, and performs like one. It is designed to haul lots of stuff and people, not navigate the twisties or even fly down the highway. Minivans are slow. There is no way any Caravan is going 0-60 in less than 11 seconds. Ours takes around 11 seconds to go 0-60 and it has the most powerful engine, the 3.8L with 180hp and 240lbs torque. The engine is geared toward low-end torque. Off the line it seems fast, and if I floor it I can burn rubber, regardless of the 16-inch tires. Yet it still weighs nearly two tons, and runs the quarter mile in nearly to 18 seconds. I have read that the new 2001 3.8L engine has 215hp and 245ft/lbs torque, which is quite a bit better. If you buy one of these minivans I would recommend getting the 3.8L V6. If you drive the speed limit and never haul much heavy cargo, than you might want the 3.3L V6 instead, for better gas mileage. Do not under any circumstances get the 4-cyl. Coupled with a 3-speed automatic it is one of the biggest jokes in the automotive industry.

The handling is what you�d expect from a vehicle its size: tons of body roll. Definitely not one for the twisties, but alright for everyday driving. The handling is very car-like, one of the great things about this minivan.

To all the idiots who think that Caravans ought to be driven like sports cars, wake up! Go buy a Nissan Maxima or a Pontiac Grand Prix GTP if you want to fly down the road. Those two cars can at least perform like sports sedans. The �Sport� Caravan is a joke. My grandparents have one, and they never exceed the speed limit. The spoiler on the back makes me laugh every time I see it. The only thing worse is the posers in V6 Automatic Mustangs who hog the fast lane on the highway. I hate Mustangs, and could go on and on, but I digress�

<b>Build Quality</b>
Chrysler�s build quality has been pretty bad in old Caravans, particularly the automatic transmissions! In our 1990 we replaced the tranny 3 times in 150k miles. There are thousands of other owners on the Internet who will tell the same sort of story. The newer Caravans are supposed to be better. Ours has around 50K and nothing major has gone wrong yet. But little annoying things, like the door sensor, door bearings, and minor lights have gone haywire. Plus it seems every 2 months there is a new recall out on something or other on it. 

In summary, if you are forced to get a minivan and have no other choice, then I would say the Caravan bears looking into as a top contender. If you don�t need one, don�t get one. Same goes with SUVs. Buy a sedan. A performance sedan. Don't let the country go down the tubes by buying one of those gus-guzzling, road-hogging SUVs.
