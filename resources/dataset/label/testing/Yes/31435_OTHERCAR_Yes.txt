            I have owned an S230 since around February. Before that, I owned an S200. I sold my S230 and received the S50 in the mail about a week ago.

The S50 is around the size of a traditional film point and shoot (roughly the shape of a disposable). It's much heavier than disposable cameras and most point and shoots, however, due to the metal body (including a sliding metal lens cover). The form factor is pretty good. However, this camera won't fit in your shirt pocket, and may be a bit uncomfortable in a pants pocket. It fits well in a jacket pocket.

Resolution, of course, is very strong for a point and shoot digital at this time (Aug. 2003). At 5 megapixels, you can print 11x14 photos at 35mm quality, and I am told you can print 16x20 photos at acceptable quality. But beyond that, I notice that images are more pleasing than they were in the S230 even when cropping down to the same resolution. This could relate to the nature of the photos I am comparing, but I suspect that the S50's better lens glass and perhaps more sophisticated processing are paying off.

The addition of a built-in speaker for videos, plus a 3-minute video limit (vs. 30 seconds on the S230 at top quality) make the video feature far more useful. I wish the camera allowed zooming in/out while shooting video, but despite that shortcoming, this takes the video mode toward the realm of the genuinely useful, while the S230's videos are more of a gimmick.

3x optical zoom makes a big difference compared with 2x. In some situations, that can be as big a difference as a step up in megapixels, since more zoom sometimes means less cropping (or if you don't edit your images - less wasted space to the sides of what you want the picture to show).

This camera seems to have more sophisticated flash and shutter settings - such as a slow shutter setting that will cause whitewater, cars on a highway or other fast-moving things to blur instead of freezing. Also, there is a setting that is intended to properly illuminate a person against a night background, to prevent the bright person-jet-black background that many cameras produce in that situation, although I haven't experimented with that. There are also nifty features such as B&W, sepia and "vivid", which were also present in the S230, but so buried in menus that they were a pain to use spontaneously. On the S50, they are just one level deep in the menus.

The slide mechanism seems that it could be susceptible to wearing down or breaking over time. It's sturdy enough, but the nature of a piece of metal sliding on the front of the camera makes me wonder. My camera feels rock-solid and stable so I could be worrying about nothing.

One disappointment is the lack of USB 2.0, which is 48 times faster than regular USB and is backward-compatible in case your computer doesn't support the faster standard. Canon should include this in all cameras, or at least the higher-end ones.
