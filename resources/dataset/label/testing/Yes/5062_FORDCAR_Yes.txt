            Update!  I've had this thing for almost a year now, and it has proved to be reliable, comfortable, and a great value.  I've had no quality control problems, and I've grown to like it even more than when I bought it.  Sadly for me, my wife likes it too.  So much so, that she has taken it over!  It's a travesty, I know, but she loves it.  This is a testament to its everyday driveability and usefulness...it's easier to haul our two small kids (+ stuff) in this, than in our SUV.  It's a great truck.
     Same complaint, though.  Gas mileage is adequate, at best, when this is used as a daily driver.  But it's a safe, useful, good-handling, good lookin' truck.  I'll think I'll have the wife write a review next time!


If you are in the market for a truck or a car, check out the F-150 Supercrew.  With four full size doors and lots of interior room, this rig is ideal for families who need a little more space, and want the versatility of a truck.

Please note...this truck has a rather short bed.  If you trailer extensively or routinely carry very heavy loads, you should consider the F-250/350 or similar competitors.  But you already know this...

I do not tow anything, and my truck is used for trips to the landfill, helping friends move their stuff, carrying off a load of tree branches, and the like.  Mine has seen a few loads of compost, some driveway rock, and some stone pavers.  It's fine for a trip to the Home Depot, unless you're buying long boards or a huge load of sheetrock.  That's why they offer home delivery!

My kids love it, because they have more room for their carseats, and a better view than my old extended cab truck.  And I love it for the added space I can use while the kids are in the carseats.  My wife loves driving it, since it is comfortable, handles well, and is very safe.  And it looks good, too.

Performance is good from the 4.6 liter V-8, and predictably better with the 5.4 liter optional engine.  I recommend the standard motor in two-wheel-drive for most folks, but step up to the larger motor for towing and four-wheel drive use.  Fuel economy is the only shortcoming I see, averaging 15 - 20 mpg under normal use.  That's competitive within the class, but a heavy foot will really penalize you at the pump.

Pricing is very competitive, as well.  MSRP runs from about $28,000 and up, but dealers will discount heavily.  I've found them willing to go as low as $22,500 for the base engine XLT (which is very well equipped, by the way).  Rebates and low financing rates really make these trucks a good deal.  Go test-drive one, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
