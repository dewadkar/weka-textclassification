            If you are looking for a great digital camera with an even better pricetag look no further than the Hewlett Packard C200 with 1 Mega Pixel.  This camera is awesome!  I couldn't ask for more in a digital camera.  One of the greatest things about this camera is how user friendly it is.  The software is Windows compatible, and you can drag the pictures right on to your hard drive.  At a price of $299 it is very easy on the wallet.  We checked out some of the higher end higher priced cameras and the Hewlett Packard was right there with them in quality.

It has auto focus for those of us who cant get it right, it has a viewfinder so you can get an idea of what the pic will look like (but I recommend you dont use that to often because it drains the batteries very quickly).  This camera comes with the memory card and a strap. 

One additional note:  I purchased my camera at Best Buy and paid extra for a 4 year warranty, which will pretty much replace the camera if anything happens to it.  Also it includes unlimited free cleanings for the camera, which come in handy, and those cleanings are not cheap!<br><br>
