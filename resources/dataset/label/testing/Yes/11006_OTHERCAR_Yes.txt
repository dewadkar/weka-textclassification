            I was looking for a vehicle where I could have passenger possibility and two instead of one dog crates.  

I first shopped Saturn, and Ford looking at the small station wagons as I'd always had a wagon.  I suddenly looked honestly at the space and decided I needed a mini van.  

I looked at all the mini vans, decided on the Astro Van (which is really a mid-size van) as I liked the handling of the rear wheel drive in a van better than the front-wheel drive.  

The seating and ride are comfortable for me to travel in.  I'd already travelled over 400 miles in an older version of the Astro Van (has not changed that much. ) I also like the view, and the space for my two crates and plenty of other stuff.  I never have to remove them as I just easily removed the rear bench seat and leave them there.  

I'm in love with the rear air conditioning as it keeps my dogs cool on hot summer days.  Also there is a spare plug for a cooler I can plug in for carrying cold items.

I think the &quot;dutch doors&quot; in the rear are the berries.  They make loading and unloading an easy task, plus with the top rear lift up window you can easily make a rain barrier while leaving the dogs have some air circulation.

I love the armrest area on the door.  It is like someone finally provided a comfortable place to rest your elbow while driving.  

Another great feature is the dome override, especially for us &quot;doggie&quot; people.  You can shut off all the dome lights and leave the rear door open for circulation.

I wish I would have gotten the second row in two seats instead of a bench as I could have removed the one seat and used the side area too, but still have plenty of room the way it is with the second bench which easily folds down flat.  

I don't care for the fact that there is no &quot;off&quot; position on the blower so you always have it blowing low whenever there is heat or air on.  

Also, I must say that I have rather small feet, but Chevy could do with a tad more foot room up front. 

The Astro Van,does make great mileage for its size and weight. It rides more like a very comfortable truck so those wishing more of a car ride should stick to the standard mini van.

All, in all, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned and would not hesitate to buy another.
