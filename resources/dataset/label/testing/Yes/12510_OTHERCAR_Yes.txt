            <b>Introduction</b>
-------------------
I first started driving this car in 1998.  At 5 years old, it was an 80,000 mile hand-me-down from my parents after I got my license.  Like most teenagers that "received" a car rather than purchase it with their own cash, I practically punished this car.

I am a very lazy person.  I am a creature-of-habbit and anything "outside" of a routine is scary to me, and so my brain says puts that into the cognitive "ignore" folder.  This includes the then foreign responsibility of owning and maintining an automobile.  Blessed with a new car, I was only interested in fun times and the newly gained independence.

<b>History</b>
-------------------
Needless to say, I was not a very good maintainer.  Tire rotations?  Not me!  Routine checkups?  Never!  Oil changes?  HAH!  When I got the car, it was in great shape (mostly because my father was very "anal" about the cars).  5 years old and 80,000 miles under its belt and the transmission was fine, the finishes and interior were still pretty and there weren't any major problems with the car.

However, this all changes as we fast forward into time and review <i>my</i> experiences with the car.  It is now 2003 and I had only changed the oil a grand total of twice in 5 years and 50,000 miles.  I have _never_ had it checked up.  I was brutal with acceleration.  My friend, who is used to a manual, drove it a few times and was known for inadverdently mashing harshly on the break (forgetting it wasn't a clutch) <i>and</i> gas pedals at the same time, producing some scary results.  Oh, and I drove the front end under a bus... twice.  (Don't ask)

<b>The Result</b>
-------------------
The car has a mind of its own.  Sometimes it's nice to me and sometimes it isn't (and I guess I return that same sentiment).  After brutal handling of this car, the transmission has stayed remarkably solid.  The breaks have gone out once (not a surprise with my driving though) and the oil leaks a bit (which probably comes from driving around with no oil for months at a time, ruining a few seals).

All of those things are directly related to my treatment of the car-- or lack thereof.

The battery seems to have a few issues though.. I did replace it twice within the same year.  Another issue is some of the wiring.  The radio system dies randomly.

Now, after 5 years of brutality, my car has finaly stopped working.  It simply refuses to run (which can be changed with a trip to the autoshop).  But after 10 years of service, I tip my hat to this car-- it served its purpose.

Overall, I think the car held up extraordinarily well to my abuse.  Any other car easily would have died within the first year I owned it.  Despite my treatment of it, it ran smoothly up until it died.  I am now ready to purchase a new vehicle of my own (which I'll be treating much better).

<b>Conclusion</b>
-------------------
The car itself doesn't really hold much value.  Cheaply priced to begin with, now it's no more than around $200 to $500-- possibly $1,000 depending on condition.  But then, at 10 years old and 150,000 miles, what car wouldn't be?

For anyone wanting a stylish car, with great handling, an awesome system, and all of that other jazz that we go for now-a-days, don't get this car.

However if you're in dire need of any piece of metal that gets you from point A to point B-- the Automatic '93 Mirage ES is the car for you.  It's by no means a competetor with any other car from its era, but for a decade old, this is a car that has some serious stay-power.  A decent one will get you transported easily, with little shelling needed for repairs.  It's surprisingly tough and will no doubt last a long time (if kept properly lol).
