            Nikon has the name brand I have trusted for many years.  My first 35mm was an old, used Nikon FM.  So up front, I went to Nikon expecting quality... and that's what I got.  This camera is all I expected and more.  For the past year and a half, I have been using the office Sony Mavica - nice, easy to use, can't beat the diskette for universal use.  But the quality is seriously lacking.  Yeah, okay.  You downsize the photo enough and it looks good on a web site.  The other camera I used was primarily a video camera, the Hitachi MPEG2 Cam - but it also took still images - but the quality was worse than the Mavica.  

So, standing there in Penn Camera, the salesman makes his pitch.  He took a photo.  Wow.  I couldn't believe it.  No pixelization.  Sharp image.  Then he showed a sample of a shot they had printed out.  Sold.  I dropped the cash at his feet right then and there.

After a couple of days shooting with this monster, I am very happy.  There are settings for everything - I've got complete control - or - none at all.  It depends on how I feel at the moment.  I love the 1600x1200 shots it gives - throw them in Photoshop and they are flawless.  

I was shooting folks at my part-time job yesterday and showing them the images.  Everyone was impressed.  Coolpix cool factor: 10

This is going to last me several years - a good investment - I've still got my Nikon FM that I bought in 1983 - used!  It works like a charm.  I can only expect the same from my new 950.

It was a bit pricey - $799 - with a $100 rebate check coming.  Who should buy this?  Anyone seriously interested in photography, web authoring or someone not willing to sacrifice quality would be a happy camper with the Nikon 950.

It doesn't sport a USB connection - so I laid out $50 for a SanDisk USB Card Reader (http://www.sandisk.com/).  That turns the memory card into another drive on you computer.  Very fast and effective.
