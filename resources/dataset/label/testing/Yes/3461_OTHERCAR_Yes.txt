            I should say that I am not a "gearhead" who tinkers with cars or anything like that. Just your average female who wanted a good sporty car for the money. This car offers that in SPADES!!

I discovered this beauty while riding in it with a client, who had just purchased it. The 6 disk CD changer, standard leather interior and sunroof certainly were eye catching, but the thing that grabbed me was the navigation system. I am one of those people with a terrible sense of direction (if you stop me on the street and ask me for directions, I would tell you "go left at the church with the red door", then right after the tall pine tree") - this car helps me ENORMOUSLY. The Navigation system is very easy to use, and even lets you store personal addresses in it. 

The Bose 6 CD in-dash player is excellent as well - I find the sound system to be top-notch. I much prefer the Acura's an in-dash changer to the trunk mounted changer offered with my previous car, the VW Jetta.

The CL has the smoothest, quietest highway ride you will ever encounter - You can easily hit 90 mph without even knowing it. In tight situations (like having to avoid something in the road) the car handles very well - it feels quite solid and heavy. The feel was much heavier than my Jetta, but once I got used to it I was fine.

The interior is well laid out, and the addition of radio/cd player controls on the steering wheel is something ALL cars should have for safety. 

The trunk is fairly large, probably because the rear seats are on the small side. However, I do not often have other passengers, so this does not bother me. My only pet peeve would be the fact the rear seats do not fold down.

All in all, a wonderful car - I have had it over a year and a half now, and love it.
