            After deciding I couldn't afford a GMC Sonoma, I finally settled on a 2000 S-10 SB 2.2L 4cyl manual LS model. I don't regret it either. It handles GREAT, and the improved clutch shifts smoothly even during hard accelerations (at least  compared to other stick shifts I've ridden in). The cab is very quiet, and carrying some extra weight isn't a problem either. Although the 4 cylinder lacks that TRUE acceleration every kid wants in a car, it DOES do a good job with the 120hp is has. On the upside, I always get between 22 and 23 mpg city.

If you're a kid looking for a reasonably priced truck, this one's the one you want. If you want a smaller pickup truck that also shows some style, the S-10's good for that too. If I had to buy a new car again right now, I wouldn't do anything different except for possibly upgrading to the V-6. test drive them BOTH first to see if it's really worth the money to you though.<br><br>
