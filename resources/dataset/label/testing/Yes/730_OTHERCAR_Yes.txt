            I once owned a 97' Eclipse and by my own experiences and a few people i know I would have to say that they were not really made all that great. Between myself and the other 4 people i knew who had Eclipses, they were in the shop longer than we owned them. Not to mention that many Eclipses have break problems. I feel that somewhere Mitsubishi lost their quality in making the Eclipse and i have vowed i will never own another Eclipse again.

My car had the following problems: Some were to driver error but most were mechanical failures:

clutch went out
transmission went out
power steering died
horn never worked
airgs were improperly installed
Brakes were bad
and about 3 otehr things were wrong but its been two years and i cannot recall what they were. 

The brakes actually caused me to get into an accident as they stopped working

Now, i have yet to test drive a 2000 Eclipse but buyers beware of purchasing an Eclipse.<br><br>
