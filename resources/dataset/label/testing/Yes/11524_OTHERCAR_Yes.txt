            I recommend this vehicle because what I pay for it compared to what I received certainly makes this vehicle an excellent value.  Many features of its peers that cost over $30,000 are included.  
For those who are shopping and wish to compare vehicles in a wide range of prices for which the Maxima could be considered the median, I would encourage others to consider the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, on the low end of the price range and the Toyota Avalon and Mercedes C-240 on the high end.  You will find that the Maxima is worth the few thousand more than the Accord and Camry.  However, comparing to the high end, you will find that the features found in the Maxima and the high end just simply don't justify the cost.  
The only downside is the Maxima comes with a high powered V-6 which requires premium gas.  I like to joke that the so called break-in period is really for breaking in the driver, not the car!
