            but don't want to spend a lot of money, yet want all the extras that come with a nice, sporty looking exciting car, then the new 2000 Volkswagon Jetta is for you.

My husband and I went car shopping and stopped at several dealerships with different kinds of cars.  They were all nice and had some of the options I wanted.  But when we came across the Jetta, I knew right there and then this was going to be my next car.  

They come in many different colors, even ones that we are not really used to seeing on the road.  The Jetta has a very roomy interior for about 5-6 passengers with both side air bags, some of them even come with 4 air bags.  The one detail that caught my eye were the cup holders for the two back seats.  (they thought of everything).  The Jetta comes with CD or cassette player, all power windows and moonroof.  You can even get the inside with leather.  The stearing wheel is tilt and the seats are very comfortable.  

You can open your windows from the outside or inside with your electronic key.  The wheels come with the alloy rims and the side deflectors even push in so that you can bump without cracking the side deflectors.  

Many extra features in this excellent package.  You can buy one well equipped for as low as $20,000.  GOOD DEAL HUH?

Gas mileage is excellent too now with those gas prices going up.<br><br>
