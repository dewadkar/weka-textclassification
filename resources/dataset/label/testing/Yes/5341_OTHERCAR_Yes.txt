            We bought this van because we needed more room for a growing family. This van seemed to have more space than the other types that were on the market. We test drove pretty much all makes and settled on this one.
This van handles very well in the snow. The anti-lock brakes and front wheel drive are major pluses on this vehicle. It also handles well in the city and on the interstate. I think it is also easy to park.
I was not crazy about the warranty. A 3 year/30,000 mile warranty is not much. I also believe that you shouldn't have to buy an extended warranty on a new vehicle. 
This year with it being 4 years old, we have had to replace the condenser on the air conditioning. We have also had to have new brakes put on. This is a low mileage vehicle. I did not feel that it is holding up well. 
I think anyone with a good sized family might consider looking at one of these vans. I would check the repair history on it before purchasing.
