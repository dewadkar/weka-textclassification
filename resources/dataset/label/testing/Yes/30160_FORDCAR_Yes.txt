            My &quot;Little Black Box&quot; commuter car is a 1991 Ford Festiva. This is the second Festiva I have owned.  The other one was a 1988 LX model.Ford and every other car manufacturer know there is a market for economy cars.  And it seems all economy cars are pretty much &quot;butt ugly&quot;.  The old Festiva's fall into that category too.  But there are some very exceptional qualities to these little &quot;boxes&quot;.Surprisingly, interior space is quite impressive.  I often fold the rear seat down so I can haul large objects in the rear.  The car of course has weight limitations, but I can throw in 15 bags of 40# wood pellets for winter warmth.  The hatchback is low, and it is easy to take objects out of the back.  A bicycle will fit in the back, as will most any camping gear I could ever need for a car camping trip.I currently have the basic Festiva, with a 4 speed transmission.  It does wind up higher than the 5 speed LX model I once owned.  Both cars get in the 50+ mpg fuel range.My current 1991 Festiva has 118K miles.  I believe it has 200K life in the moter.  I change the oil every 3K miles, and so far I have had $0 mechanical problem.  The 1988 Festiva I sold had over 100K miles on it too, &amp;, no mechanical problems.The standard radio is, well, junk.  The speakers are not much more than a couple of tin cans.  If I wanted superior sound,  I could go out and buy it.  The car does not get much attention from others.  My friends &amp; coworkers laugh -- &quot;your little black box is ugly!&quot; they say.  And, they are right.But, it is PAID FOR.  It gets very good fuel economy.  It has enough room to haul anything I need for a weekend, or a cross country trip.  The longest road trip I have made in a Festiva is about 3K miles in a long weekend.The front wheel drive helps in wintertime.  I have never been stuck in snow -- yet.  The little car has a relatively high clearance, and just goes right through my winter snow.I would recommend a Ford Festiva for anyone that wants good fuel economy, large interior space, and low pricetag.<br><br>
