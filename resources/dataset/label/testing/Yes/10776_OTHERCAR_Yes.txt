            I've owned two Tahoe's (1995 &amp; 1999) -- fully loaded.  We got a puppy about 6 months ago and needed more space -- for the dog and three teenagers who don't want to &quot;touch&quot; each other.

I grew up with two Suburbans that my father used to tow an Airsteam trailer -- 1967 and 1974.  Today's Suburban is nothing like the old ones.

Lets begin with what I don't like (or could be improved).  

WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED

First, the passenger seat seems to be too close up when it is in its furthers position back.  I think this is becuase the dash has been redesigned and it gives the passenger the impression that you are closer forward.  Not a big deal, just a noticable change.  

The PRICE... &quot;This isn't your father's Suburban&quot;.  Mine listed over $43, 000.

There are no controls for the rear seat passengers to control the heating and air conditioning in the rear (Chrysler mini vans have this and it is a nice feature).

I've got a $700 computer controlled &quot;ride option&quot; which is supposed to adjust the ride electronically depending on load.  I didn't order this, it came included.  Now, for such an expensive option, you would think you would get something visual.  I mean, I really can't tell it this option does anything.  It would be nice to have a button or indicator to tell you its working so you feel better about the expense.  Its kind of like the light that flashes at the car wash when you pay extra for &quot;wax&quot;. 

There are 30 drink holders, but there are an adequate supply. 

Now I've only got 500 miles on it so I can't provide a reliable report on quality etc except to say that so far, everything is perfect.

WHAT DO I LIKE?

Very, very comfortable front seats -- they really hug you.
Rear door -- it opens like a mini van (and its easy to do).  It also has a wiper and fluid to keep it clean. 

Improved ride - smooth and quite.  This monster is a dream to drive.  Even backing up isn't that big of deal.

Walk through second row seating like a mini van -- this makes it much easier to get to the third row of seating.  Also, captains chairs in the second row is a plus.

Moon roof -- really brightens things up and lets more air in when you want it. 

Improved sound system with bass speaker.  In addition, the rear passengers have the ability to listen to and control FM/CD/cassette in the rear (via two headphone jacks).  The people in the front (adults) can listen to one source (say a CD) and the people in the rear (i.e. kids) can listen to the FM.  Its a sanity feature.

OnStar -- this is really cool.  More important it could come in handy if you are in trouble or need help.  What is OnStart?  The vehicle comes equipped with a GPS (global positioning system) and cell phone.  You push a button on the dash board and it dials up an OnStar operator who knows exactly where you are.  They will assist you with -- getting a flat fixed or gas.  If you are locked out of your call, they can remotely unlock it (you call from another phone of course).  They will even help you with directions, finding a hotel or resturant and making reservations.  Mine is free for the first year (they want to get you hooked).  Nobody from two GM dealerships could tell me how it will be billed after the first year -- I think they are still figuring it out.  I'd probably sign up for &quot;a per call&quot; charge basis in case I really needed it. 

The controls for the heated front seats are easier to get to -- having two settings is nice; our Lexus doesn't have this and I wish the seats would warm up like the Tahoe's/Suburbans.

The doors automatically lock.

There is a light in the bottom of the rear view mirrow which shines on the gound when you go to open the door at night -- a nice touch.

All the corners are rounded and updated.  The Suburban isn't a stylish vehicle -- it never was.  This is a nice update however.  

Good power for a huge beast yet the mileage is slightly better than my past two Tahoes.
