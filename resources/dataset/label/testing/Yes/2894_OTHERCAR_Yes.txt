                 This is also about my first car, a 1992 Eagle Vista (same prototype as a Dodge Colt, different name). After seeing this car in its present condition, many asked me why I bought this car. The reasons are as follows :

1. price - $1000 CAN (cheap when you think about it especially considering my financial situation)
2. mileage - only 90,000 kms on it 
3. history - *related to 2* This car has only had 1 owner (my brother-in-law) who has been a long-time cop and, because he often drove cruisers and police vehicles, he rarely had to drive his Vista.
4. interior - despite seeming very compact at first (if a car's too roomy, I get lost inside), once you put the back seat down, a lot more room becomes available (I should know as I slept rather comfortably back there once).
5. economical - between $20 and $30 CAN gets you 45 liters of gas that lasts anywhere from 400 - 500 kms in the city to 700 - 800 kms on the highway
6. power - surprising get-up-and-go from a smallish 1.5 L, 4 cylinder Mitsubishi engine

     Now comes the interesting history of my little "speeder". In the eight years that my brother-in-law owned this car : 

- it was in two serious accidents and one minor one (severe body work required)
- the first engine blew up once on the highway (engine replaced) and the second slowly died last fall (engine replaced again)

Despite the major "operations" that have been required for this car, I will probably drive it until the third engine dies (at which point I should be able to afford a new car). Why, you ask ? Well, for one thing, there is a lot of sentimental attachment to this car. My brother-in-law drove it for 5 years and my sister drove it for 5 and they have both been through a lot with it. Also, this is my first car so of course I love it with all my heart. Finally, it performs exceptionally well in extreme conditions such as Canadian winters (always starts immediately once the key is turned, it takes a while but once the heater gets going in the winter, I end up having to take off my jacket if I'm in the car for an extended period of time) ! However, now that these major things have been done/will be done, the car is mechanically sound and runs beautifully. The new shocks and bodywork are just so I can keep my dignity. I LOVE MY CAR ! 

Future plans for the car : 
- complete bodywork, Spring/Summer 2001 (don't worry, I'm getting a deal ...)
- new shocks, Spring/Summer 2001
