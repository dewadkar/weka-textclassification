            My husband and I received this camera as a wedding gift.  Not only did we not own a camera at the time but were planning on buying one for the honeymoon.  

With great anticipation we read the owners use manual on the plane to Puerto Rico.  It seemed easy enough.  It was definitely great to be able to see what the photo would look like before and after taken, before development.  Not only does this preserve your memory but you don't have to develop or print lousy pictures!

The camera itself was very self-explanatory and we never had any trouble using it.  However, there were several things that would have made it easier to take more pictures and enjoy it more often.

1.  The batteries run low very quickly!!  Have back up ready and use the plug-in option to review your photos whenever you can.  We were caught by surprise by the speed with which the batteries were drained.
2.  The memory card only holds so many pictures, depending on your pixel choice.  So, while you won't need to buy film, you ought to have additional memory cards on hand.  This is especially important when away from your home computer or laptop where you could dump your images if you needed more space.
3.  The camera is a little unwieldy.  It is heavy, the surface is very slick and the viewfinder is flush with the camera making it that more difficult to judge a good photo. 

We still use the camera quite often.  Sometimes it is just at home when we need a quick photo of something for insurance purposes, proving theories to friends, other fun stuff you may have had to have a Polaroid for in the past.<br><br>
