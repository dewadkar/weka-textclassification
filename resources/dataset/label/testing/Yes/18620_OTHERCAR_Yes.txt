            I have not owned an Alero, but as it's become a standard car of rental fleets since the beginning of 1999, I've logged nearly four weeks of total driving time with it. Many aspects of the car are attractive. The styling is nice; it handles well; there's nothing particularly wrong with the interior appointments.

 But each time I've rented the car I've worried about one specific feature -- and any time I forget about that problem, I'm reminded the next time I get the car. It has to do with rear window visibility. A combination of (a) the size and placement of front-seat headrests; (b) the placement of roof supports in the rear; and (c) the curve and shape of the rear windows means that there is a much larger blind spot, when looking over your shoulder either right or left, than in most other cars I've driven.
 
  Here is a way you can test this for yourself without renting or buying an Alero: find one on the road (hey, around an airport they'll be a big part of the outbound rental fleet) and drive behind the Alero, in a classic &quot; blind spot&quot; position. That is, be in the lane next to the Alero, and about a car length behind it. Then -- TRY TO SEE THE DRIVER! If you can't see the driver, the driver can't see you. You will, I think, notice that the window and the headrest combine for a larger blind spot than in most cars. Yes, rearview mirrors offset this to some degree, but when changing lanes on a busy road there's nothing to replace looking back and seeing the traffic for yourself. I have been renting a Camry this week and have been relieved each time I look over my shoulder to find that I can, in fact, see what's coming up behind me on either side.

  Driver height is no doubt a factor here. (I'm 6'1&quot;.) So is personal taste. There are probably people for whom the Alero's visibility is a perfect match. My point is not to buy or avoid the Alero on this factor only; but if you're otherwise interested in the car, be sure to check out this aspect.
