            The Honda Civic CRX (R.I.P.) was America's top imported car for the years 1987-1991. It earned MotorTrend's Car of the Year 3 years in a row. So why did Honda cancel production in its prime? Who knows, but this car is one of the best sports-coupes you can buy.

The CRX was introduced in 1984, not as a sporty car, but as a high-mileage sub compact that looked decent. However, the peppy little two seater earned a huge fan base (yes, a fan base for a car) and the next year (1985) Honda introduced the CRX Si and CRX HF. The Si was the CRX with a bigger, more powerful engine, as well as extra options, like alloy wheels, and a rear window wiper. The HF was the &quot;High Fuel&quot; version, which got upwards of 50 MPG Highway, and 41 MPG City.

Honda Re-designed the CRX in 1988, with the new 2nd Generation body style. It was more attractive, aerodynamic, and bigger.

The car itself is like driving a real sports car, except it's low maintenance, and pretty inexpensive by today's standards. It glides along the road smoothly, and is surprisingly fast for a Honda. Oh, and it's very comfortable too. A car enthusiast (who is 6' 5&quot;) was surprised at how far he could stretch his legs, and commented on how comfortable it was.

There are a few cons however. Honda seemed to have neglected a few problems here and there while testing the car. First, the ride is not very quiet. The windows are frameless, which lets noise in. The floor is not very well insulated, which also contributes to road noise. Also, the hatch in the back, after a couple of years, loses its quietness..the bolts holding a couple parts in come loose and rattle a lot. Probably the biggest con is how low to the ground it is. Getting in an accident with say, a Suburban, or an F250 would probably mean either 1) Death, or 2) a totaled car. Basically, it's like driving a little tin can around, you just better hope you don't get in an accident.

Aside from the safety concerns, if you like a fun drive, the CRX is your car. At a reasonable price, and plenty of stuff to modify, it's a great deal.<br><br>
