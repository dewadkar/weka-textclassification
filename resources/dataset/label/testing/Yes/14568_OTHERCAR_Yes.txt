            I bought this product because I need instant gratification. I can't stand the torture of waiting for my photos to come back from the lab, and I don't want to pay extravagant sums for one-hour developing. The Sony Mavica is the perfect solution for the click-happy shutterbug who likes to take lots of photos, but doesn't have an in-home darkroom or an interest in the nuances of traditional photography.
The great thing about the Mavica is that you can take a photo and instantly see how it turned out on the built-in color LCD display. If it sucked, take it again until you get it right! Non-digital cameras don't come close to offering this feature.
With film, you take the photo and cross your fingers. If it's a one-time shot, forget it. When you're using the Sony Mavica, you can try a variety of shots, with or without flash, and look at the photos until you get what you want. You can take black and white photos or add a &quot;sepia&quot; effect that looks like an old-tyme photo that you get at the county fair.
A standard high-density floppy disk is your &quot;film,&quot; and holds about a ton of standard-resolution photos, great for internet use, and half that amount of high-resolution pix that you can print out on your printer.
One criticism that I have heard about this product is that it does not produce the glossy, permanent prints that you get when you use a film camera. If you are willing to spend some extra money, you can get a decent inkjet printer for a few hundred bucks that, when used with special photo paper, prints photos that look a lot like traditional prints. If you go this route and are willing to learn some software, you will get permanent prints that are superior to those that you get from the photo lab!
You can correct red-eye and other common problems, adjust contrast and color just as you do on your TV, and even remove your finger or the camera strap from the shot! You can print wallets and 8&quot;x10&quot;s to your heart's desire without paying for reprints! The newer Mavicas can store a minute-long MPEG movie, complete with sound. And like I said, the photo lab people never see your photos. Start your own, ahem, website. Ooh la la!
The fact that this camera uses floppy disks poses a problem for some computer owners. People with Windows-based PCs generally have floppy drives and can use the Sony Mavica disks. The iMacs, however, don't come with a floppy drive. You'll have to shell out some extra bucks for one if you want to use your Mavica, since I don't think you can connect USB cables like with some other digital cameras.
If you do consider a Mavica, take note of the useful features that you get with the higher-end models, and be sure to get a decent printer and some photo-quality paper to get the most out of your purchase.<br><br>
