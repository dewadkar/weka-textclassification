            My Regal was my baby until my wife decided that I needed one more real baby. It was impossible to fit 2 car seats and a 7 year old in the back seat. I had no other choice but to trade my baby for a mini van. When my wife wasn't looking I got to say a formal goodbye to my car. If she only knew how close I was to this car maybe I wouldn't have to trade it.  The seats were so comfortable even after riding for hours at a time.  I actually believe that if my wife was ever mad enough to have me sleep outside, I would be able to sleep in my car with no problems. The car handle like a dream. This car is good for both single and married people.  It is not good for people who have more than 2 children.
If I ever buy another car it would be a Buick Regal.
