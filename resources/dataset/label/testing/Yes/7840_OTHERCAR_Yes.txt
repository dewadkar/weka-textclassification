            My wife and I bought a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo with only 32,000 miles on it and so far, we love it!  It has great pick-up speed but doesn't guzzle gas (about 20-25 MPG) and drives and rides like a luxury car.  We liked the looks of it so we decided to take it on a test drive, directly after that, we fell in love with it and bought it.  It is perfect for long vacations as well as a great &quot;grocery getter&quot; making it the nearly perfect vehicle without the huge price tag.  So far the only complaint we have is the fact that there is quite a bit of wind noise that the front doors create.  This negative is easily overlooked if you consider all of the positives.  I highly recommend this truck to everyone and I hear the '98 and '99 are even better.<br><br>
