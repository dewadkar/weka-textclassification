            This is not a car. This is a presence. A powerful presence. From the sheer size to the fact that you can blow by anyone while driving on the highway, this car embodies everything mysterious but yet incredibly strong.

The Drive:

I took out the 1999 S500 for a test drive as I hope to have one in a few months time. We got in and I really didn't find it all that entirely difficult to learn the controls. Many have said otherwise. Granted I have no idea how to do half the things it can do but that comes while sitting in long traffic lights. You'll no longer be bored, if anything a red light can be a good thing as it gives you time to play around with the numerous functions.

The windows are thick, almost bulletproof I heard. The sunroof is also huge as compared to about 90% of the cars out there. At first the seats seemed uncomfortable but after using the incredibly easy seat controls it felt better that being in a massage recliner. Everything is large in scope inside as it is out. There is plenty of leg room even though the lower base under the steering wheel can be tiresome as if you don't adjust the seat perfectly it'll scrape right below your knee.

The S500 isn't too hot off the line but once she gets moving she just soars. Like others have said, it's like driving on air. I took a few hard corners and found the car to slip a bit which was troubling but then again this car isn't exactly made to handle like a BMW 300I. It's a breeze to overtake any car on the road and it's all done with an immense amount of class and style. People just move out of the way when your barreling down the highway in this car. It doesn't matter how fast any other sports car can go because people generally become annoyed and stay put right in front you. With the S500 you don't even have to ride their bumper or flash your lights to get them to move, they move without you even asking.

My favorite aspect has to be the power that this car gives off. Just look at a black S500 with slightly tinted windows. When this car comes past your car you look and if you have any clue you admire. Who's inside? These cars have been driven by the most powerful people in our history. From the leaders in Russia during the Cold War to previous and current day high standing US officials to the mob this car is the symbol of absolute power, even if your no more than a lowly inventor or broker ;)

S-Class 1994-1999 only:  

The new S class models (2000-2003) look nowhere near as nice as the 94-99. As if Ford didn't only buy Jaguar but also the S Class. Sorry but the new design is too grandmotherly for my taste. Too plastic. Not tank-like enough.

Class Difference:  The difference between the S420 and the S500 is 25 horses. It makes a difference on the BMW's but I've yet to try a S420. The S600 is a huge V12. There's about a $5,000 difference between the S420 and the S500. You'll have to get it used but I've seen a few with about 40,000 miles in the mid 30's range. Better than 100k for a new one that looks half as good. Try to get a warranty and if you can't make sure you know a mechanic that knows Mercedes because Mercedes Dealer Service will burn a hole right through any bank account.

Test Drive one:

It's a keen obsession and has become all too distracting because not having one is tiresome at times. I never really took too much notice at any real nice cars until I found out I may be able to afford one. Not having an S500 just makes me want one even more and hopefully that'll come true soon enough.

Find a dealer, shave and get dressed nicely, act like you've found the cure for cancer and they'll let you test drive one. They have books full of excuses if they don't like the way you look. And if you like it start making money. You'll thank yourself.
