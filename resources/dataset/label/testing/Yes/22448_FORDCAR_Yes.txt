            I have had many cars but have only wanted 1 TRUCK.  When I was able to buy my first truck I didn't want just any ole truck, I wanted 1 that would fit my 6'1&quot; 200lb frame and be able to pull a boat.  I didn't have to funds to get a full size and to tell you the truth I never have been a full size fan.  I looked at the Chevy and the Dodge then the Ford. And I can tell you that the Range won it hands down.  It was the only truck with height, style, cab room and a V-6 with some power all wrapped up in a $14,500 package.....people.....it just doesn't get any better that that..:o)<br><br>
