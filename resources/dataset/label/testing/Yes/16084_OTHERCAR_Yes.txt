            I leased this Black Beauty (taupe leather interior) 75 days ago. It was a dealer demonstrator with 6,300 miles on it. I love the looks, power, and comfort &amp; convenience features. I hate the dealer in Burlingame, CA that I leased from, their poor service department, and sales staffs' unprofessional behavior (making fun of customers after they've left the showroom. Hmmm, wonder what they said after I left). They also played a classic &quot;bait &amp; switch&quot; routine. My first offer was $ 0 down, and $ 389.00 per month. What I ended up with was $ 1,800 down, and $ 569.00 a month. It is a dream to drive, as long as you're not going more than 75 miles. It swallows up even the largest potholes with only a mild jolt. I have been on some pretty rough off-road terrain (Pacific Crest Trail, Lake Tahoe, CA) and must say it handled it very nicely. Plenty of power(4.7L V8). It has had a number of problems that were all very difficult to have repaired. Daimler-Chrysler's customer service was great, but the dealership needs to get their act together. I've had to call Daimler-Chrysler's customer service for each problem, have them contact the dealer's service manager, then take the vehicle in. Usually it takes them 10-15 minutes just to acknowledge my presence, standing directly in front of them. I have encountered &quot;radial tire pull&quot; (something that I had previously not know existed after 10 cars and 16 years behind the wheel). I still think it's an alignment issue. The fuel pump had to be replaced because it was siphoning the gas back into the tank after engine shut-off. I don't know if the lack of fuel while trying to start it has caused any long term damage to the fuel injection system. And last, but not least id the brake rotors that have warped and needed to be resurfaced after only 7500 miles. I would recommend this vehicle to people who do mostly short-trip driving. It's very hard to find just the right seat position for long drives, even with all of the power seat positions available. <br><br>
