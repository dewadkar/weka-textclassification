            My dad picked up a 98 Chevy 2500 work truck, and I love it. It's a regular cab long box 4x4 with the vortec 350. The work truck is a lower line, with two square headlights instead of the normal 4. It is still a very nice truck.

This truck has a lot of power, the 350 really makes it get up and go. It'll tow a 4 place snowmobile trailer with absolutely no problem. It also hits the 100 mph governer really quickly. It also gets around 15 mpg, which isn't too bad.

The ride is a little stiff when empty, especially with the stock tires. They are pretty tiny, and load range E that can take up to 80 psi. If they are fully inflated you get one stiff ride. Now it has 285-75's and rides MUCH smother, but still not perfect. Most people don't buy a work truck for the ride anyway.

The interior is quite nice, very comfortable. The bench seat in much more formed and comfy than my 92 Chevy's. The dash is well laid out and everything is easy to use. The power ports for cigarette lighter accessories are nice, too.

This is a tough truck. With the wheels and tires and 2 inch lift it is very capable off road. The tow hooks are nice for when you get a little too off the road. 

I would recommend this truck. It has gobs of power for towing or hauling, is very comfortable inside, looks great and gets decent gas milage for the power it puts out.<br><br>
