            I had a 1989 Ford Taurus Wagon and absolutely loved all the room in it.  It was finally time to put that car to sleep and I went out looking for the replacement.  
I new I wanted at least a wagon, and would look into minivans as well.  They changed the Taurus too much that I did not fit into the new design any more.  I am 6 foot 7, so leg room is important to me.  I did not find a wagon that had enough legroom, so I went to the minivans.  
None of the other vans had as much room as the Dodge, so I bought it.  That was one year ago today.  
I love this van.  There is plenty of room for myself and my family and all of our junk when we travel.  It is very comfortable for long road trips (we just finished a 3400 mile trip).  
I have put almost 30,000 miles on my car already, and the only maintenance I have done is changing the oil and rotating the tires.  It still drives like it was brand new.  I highly recommend this car to anyone looking at minivans.  BUY AMERICAN!<br><br>
