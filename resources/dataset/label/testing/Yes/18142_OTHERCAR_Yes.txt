            If you're tired of snapping front axles while you're out 4wheeling, or even blowing out a whole differential, look no further than any chevy/gm truck no later than 1987. The dana 60 front differential is absolutely incomparable to any other Light-duty pickup truck axle. Instead of standard ball joints, it comes with a superior king pin setup which i have found unbreakable. With a 350cubic inch engine, 4:10 gears it has plenty of power to push or pull anything you want. The interior is quite roomy as it is a full size vehicle, however, it is not for a family man with more than 1 kid and a wife. This truck certainly is a work horse and I will probably keep this and and my 85 suburban (converted to 1ton) forever. Chevy trucks last a long time, and a built extremely solid. If you don't need an extremely heavy duty light pickup truck, a 2500 or even 1500 would be more suitable than the beefy 3500. Registration in most states is also a lot more than a regular pickup on a 3500 (1ton) due to the pulling capacity of it.
