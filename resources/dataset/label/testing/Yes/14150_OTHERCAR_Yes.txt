            I bought this camera because I wasn�t sure I wanted to cross over to digital cameras or not.  I also decided that I didn�t want to spend a lot of money on something I may not use.  After looking around, I came across this model the Fuji Fine Pix 1300 and thought I would give it a try.  The price was reasonable $180.00 with a $40.00 mail in rebate for a 1.3 mega pixel digital camera.  

The camera comes with:

1.3 Million Sensor CCD (1280 x 960 Pixel File)
Digital 2x Telephoto for photography and 1.2x to 4x zoom playback function
Fujifilm Image Processing technology for Maximum Color Fidelity
1.6 Color LCD Playback Monitor
Convenient USB Port for Fast File Transfers to a Computer
Removable 8MB SmartMedia� Memory
Leather case and carrying strap
Photo editing software and drivers
Requires 4 AA batteries

I was amazed at how clear the pictures come out on the LCD screen and how easy it was to transfer them from camera to computer.  One problem I did have was the coloring of photographs. They all seemed to have red tint to them and I mean RED.  I have my digital pictures developed professionally and the first time I did those were red too.  (I thought it was my monitor).  I now have to adjust and fine tune all pictures before I upload them.  

The pictures (once adjusted and with a good printer) do print out fantastic.  I have printed out 8x10s that have looked almost like they came from regular film.  Another down side is the 2x telephoto.  That is only for use in 640x480 mode. It won't work in the 1280x960 which was a disappointment.  

With 8MB media card you do get a sufficient amount of pictures available depending on what setting you have it on:
1280 x 960 Fine-12 pictures
1280 x 960 normal-24 pictures
1280 x 960 basic 47 pictures
640 x 480 89 pictures

All in all this camera isn't a bad one but it isn't a great one. I still prefer the traditional method of taking pictures but this camera does well for the photos you email and for websites.
