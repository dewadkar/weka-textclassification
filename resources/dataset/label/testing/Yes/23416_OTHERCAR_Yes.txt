            I have been hired as a private consultant by GM to rate their cars and I have to admit that I was impressed with the Intrigue.  I drove the vehicle for a while and was extremely impressed.  The car handled smoothly and had wonderful response.  The seating is extremely comfortable and the climate controls are great.  However, I would say that I was extremely impressed with the sound system.  With the use of BOSE technology and superior CD player it was like sitting in my own private concert. I drove the car on some pretty bumpy and rough roads and the CD player never skipped once.

There are some issues that I found that can be changed.  I found the buttons for heater adjustments too small and difficult to find while you are driving.  The rear seats are ok for children but slightly uncomfortable for adults. Also, the rear doors have a tendency to stick a little when opening.

Overall I was extremely pleased with the car.  It had quick response, had good passing power,and a very smooth transmission.  

I would recommend this car to the family as well as to the individual who is looking for something sporty.  It fits both situations very well.
