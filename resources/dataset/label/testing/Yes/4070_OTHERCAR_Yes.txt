            We have driven our '98 Venture 75,000+ miles since we bought it in May of '98. It has been durable and versatile, from taking our teenagers rock climbing, our family backpacking and camping, fishing and sightseeing. We have been able to take my husband's aged father who needed to be lifted in with a minimum of problems, with ample storage space for his wheelchair. It has been durable enough for us to haul long items (like new doors) and messy items, like plants. We have taken our Venture on 2 major vacations of over 2500 miles each and it has performed reliably, with a minimum of discomfort in taking 5 people and one big dog as well as camping equipment! It performs well in different weather conditions, especially in snow. However, it does seem to show a propensity for rolling if driving at high speeds and trying to miss a deer in the middle of the night! (Didn't happen but was close!!)<br><br>
