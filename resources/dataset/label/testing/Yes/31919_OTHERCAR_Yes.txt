            My 2001, Subaru Forester is the first "new" car that I have purchased. As I pat myself on the back, I thank myself that I bought a great car.
 
I have had the car (SUV, car, station Wagon, truck, whatever you want to call it) for about 3 months now. It has 3,500 miles on the car so far. Basically this means that I put about 1,000 miles on the car each month, translating into me filling up the gas tank about every 9 days. So far, the Forester has given me about 23.9 miles-per-gallon. About 3/4 of my driving is city and the other 1/4 is highway. When I first bought the car, I was only getting about 19-20 miles-per-gallon, not very good for a 4 cylinder car. However, the mileage slowly went up as the car went through its "break-in" period, and I have gotten fairly consistent gas mileage ever since. 
<b>UPDATE --My average Mileage is now about 24.7 MPG mixed driving and 27.5 Highway.--</b> 
The size of the inside of the car is almost perfect for me and my passengers. I rarely have 5 people in the car, but the few times that I have, the passengers seemed to have "enough" room in back. There is gobs of room in the back of the Forester, with lots of little hiding places under the floor mat for those little goodies (flashlight, flares, first aid, and of course the full-size spare). The rear passenger seats easily fold down. I had no trouble fitting a 5x4 computer table-top in the back. I 100% recommend the extra rubber mat that sets on the rear cargo floor. It keeps dirt in control and is easy to clean.
The handling of the Forester is stable and sturdy. The AWD gives me that extra confidence while driving in the rain, and dirt. I am looking forward to taking it up into the snow.
<b>UPDATE --- I have recently driven in the snow. The snow was not DEEP. The road however, was a mixture between snow and a dirt road with pot holes and ruts. I was amazed at eh feel and comfort. Very smooth and easy to handle. Not to mention, the CD player did not skip once.</b>
The little things/extras? Upgrade the speaker system if you can afford it. It does make a difference. Sunroof/moonroof, as far as I am concerned, is mandatory. The Forester has a moon-roof that really appealed to me. It is large enough for both the front and rear passengers to both enjoy. "WHAT A CONCEPT." Also, my forester has the "All Weather Package." That gives me things like heated mirrors, and wipers; but best of all, heated seats. Ahhhhhh...If you live anywhere where is gets chilly, then the heated seats are a must. The other option that I recommend, is the auto dimming/compass mirror. It helps you get lost less often and keeps you from getting blinded by the cars headlights behind you.
