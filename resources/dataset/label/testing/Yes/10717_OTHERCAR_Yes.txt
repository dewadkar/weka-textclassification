            I've put over 90,000 miles on my (okay, its my wife's) Caddy and I can honestly say that I have never driven a car that satisfied so many desires in an automobile as this one does. 
The 4.9 liter V-8 is more responsive than many of the hot rods that I owned in my misspent youth, and gas mileage on the highway (23-25 MPG) is well above what I would have expected. City driving nets only about 15 mpg, but she is a big, heavy car.
The interior (leather in this case) is succulent. Some more development and thought could have gone into the control locations, and there are some features that I would have expected to find on a car in this price range missing. However, the sheer room of this vehicle leave even the most claustriphobic among us breathing with ease. I don't believe I have ever seen a post-50's back seat this large. The front seat offers the same head and leg room as well.
Repair bills (if and when they come due) seem to be higher for the Caddy than for some other cars that I have owned, and the use of premium gasoline is a must for this vehicle.
All in all, a supreme vehicle to own and to drive.
