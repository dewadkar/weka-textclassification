            Recently on a weekend getaway, I rented a car.  Alamo gave me a 2001 Chevy Cavalier.  Based on my previous Cavalier experience (the 1998 model) I was pretty excited.  I remembered the nice handling, easy driving car.  

The 2001 model still rides nice.  It's got decent pickup speed, and the car handles remarkably well based on my experience with other compact cars.

The interior is nice and roomy.  I had a ton of leg room in the front seat.  But the seats were incredibly uncomfortable.  They'd be fine for my 10 minute ride to work everyday, but after sitting in the car for 3 hours, my back was aching.  I found it very hard to get comfortable in this car.

The dash board is a big waste of space.  A big black mass of plastic.  While I have no suggestions on what to put there, it just seemed to have an odd layout.

Stereo was nice and loud, and there were cup holders which is a definite bonus.

This driving experience has definitely swayed me from buying a Chevy Cavalier in the future.  I refuse to spend that much money (which actually isn't THAT much) to ride around being uncomfortable in the seats.

This car is decently priced for people on a budget.  It would probably be a great car for someone just buying their first car or a student maybe.

I wouldn't buy a compact if I had to tow kids around or anything like that.  But it's definitely a resonable car.
