            I had my eye on a Jetta GLX for 6 months before I bought one.  During that time I met all of the dealers in my area, and test drove just about every model.  

In the end it was a decision between the super-efficient TDI, or the super-loaded GLX.  I went for the GLX. I fell for the extra gadgets.  The GLX has little extras that you can't get on the lesser models, such as a trip computer, fog lamps in place of convex mirrors in the headlamps, woodgrain trim, traction control, and memory power seats.  

The attention to detail shows up everywhere you look in this car.  The interior lights fade off when they go out.  The stereo stays on until you pull out the key.  I even discovered a little undocumented feature-- The car has an electric water pump that runs when the key is on, so you can stay warm in the car while someone dashes into the store for "only 5 minutes" without leaving the engine running.  Unlike most American cars, the fuel gauge is painfully accurate.  It drops away from full within the first gallon, and when it hits "E" you'd better have a gas station in mind, because there's only about 1 1/2 gallons left.  Much better than my Chevy that has 1/4 tank when the gauge reads 1/2.

Traction control is a nice feature that uses the ABS system to keep the front wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces.  It has proven to work quite well in Utah snowstorms.  A warning lamp flashes on the instrument panel to indicate that the traction control is activated, which can give you an early warning that you are on a slippery surface.

The instrument panel is quite a sight to see at night.  It is pleasantly illuminated with blue and red LED's that are easy on the eyes.

For the safety-minded, the car has two front airbags, two side airbags in the seat backs, and two side-curtain airbags above the windows.  In crash tests, it rated right up at the top of its class along with the Honda Civic.

Another option that the Jetta can come with is 16 or 17 inch wheels and sport suspension.  The wheels help set the looks of the car apart from your average econo-box, and the sport suspension gives the car a firm ride, and helps it stick right to the road in sharp turns.

The engine is very smooth, and really starts to kick in at 5000 rpm's.  The 5-speed gearshift also operates so smoothly, that at first I thought the whole transmission was electronically controlled, and that the shifter was only flipping a switch-- not the case, though.  This car'll have you going 90 MPH in no time if you don't watch it.

There are a few cons to this car.  First of all, the price.  This car is Volkswagen's best seller, and none of the dealers I went to wanted to discuss any price besides the sticker price unless I was ready to buy.  I also made the mistake of signing a purchase agreement for "a reasonable price" plus taxes, fees, and licensing-- only to find out afterwards that the standard dealer's fee was $350!  Know what you want to pay before you walk in to the dealer, and watch the bottom line.

The VR6 and 1.8T also are not for the economy minded.  Both cars have great acceleration, both have fuel economy in the 20-30 range, AND they require premium unleaded fuel.  Add in an extra .20/gallon to those planned visits to the pump.  I ended up buying a 2001 model after test driving the 2002 because of the deal I was offered on it.  The difference between the two is that the later 2002's have a 24 valve 200hp VR6 engine available while the earlier VR6 was a 12 valve 174hp engine.

At 6'2", I have plenty of room in the front seat, and the back seat is even tolerable for short trips when my daughter prevails on me to take over the wheel.  For a family car with lots of room, spend the extra for the Passat.  For a runaround car, trade in the extra pounds for performance, and get the Jetta.
