            Great truck. Low priced and loaded with features. I wanted a roomy, powerful and comfortable SUV and the Xterra had all I wanted and more. Acceleration is a little bit slow, but you dont feel it on a V6. Nice ergonomics, well designed interiors. I drove 25hrs non-stop and didn't feel a thing. Great maneuverability, turns on a dime. Has a really useful first aid kit. The music system could be better, but it's definitely not bad. It's a little bit rough on road, but off the road, it's great!
Overall a great buy if you have an active life style and you're looking for a cost effective, stylish SUV.<br><br>
