            Last year my friend and I took a road trip across the country and back. His father was nice enough to let us use his brand new Subaru Forester S model, with the leather interior option. It was the PERFECT car for the trip. The gas mileage was good, the ride was suburb, we felt safe at all times, the all wheel drive aspect adding to that feeling of security, and had plenty of room for ourselves and all of our belongings. The seats were very comfortable even for extended drives (our longest being 13 hours). Up front we had enough room to not feel cramped or claustrophobic, and enough room in the back for all of our belongings and still room to see out the back. The car itself handles like a car, but has rugged capabilities. The all wheel drive came in handy when we crossed the Rockies, and we never had to bring the car in for any problems except for an oil change. Subaru's service is great, they replaced a smashed rear windshield that we got quickly and easily. The only complaint I have of the car is the factory installed CD player. It only recognizes certain types of CD's but other then that the car was perfect! I would reccomend it for anyone who has that desire to get out and go on a road-trip. It is the perfect Cross-Country vehicle. Have a good and safe trip!!
