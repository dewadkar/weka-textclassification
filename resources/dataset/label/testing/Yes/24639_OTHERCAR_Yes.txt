             I paid 27500 for my infiniti I30 limited. It had 3500 miles so it was like a new car. I test drove a es300 and was not impressed. I had a v6 camry and felt like it was the same car all over again. The service was horrible. I went there by myself. I am a 17 year old senior in high school so the salesman didnt take me seriously. I made up my mind to never buy a Lexus. I went to a acura dealer but had to wait about a week for it to be in stock. Other than good looks and honda engine, i wasnt sold on the acura either. 
 The first thing i saw when i visited the dealer were a couple of workers washing a customers car. I was delighted to see that. I told the dealer i was looking for a nice car to drive around. I thought he was going to offer me a cloth interior used g20. But he asked me really nicely what model i was interested in. I said an Infiniti I30. He quickly showed me the show room white i30 limited model. He even let me start the engine. I asked for a test drive and he said sure. He also said that it would make me a buyer. I laughed and was skeptical. I drove it and WOW! what a rush. This car boned out like crazy. 20 to 40 mph was a snap. He didnt really get mad that i accelerated fast and talked with me the whole time. I came back about 3 days later with my parents and they drove it. They really liked the car and were trilled that it had side air bags. Well that all I have to say. I'll close with this. Even for the 2000 model. Own one and you'll understand, Infiniti lives up and more to that motto.
