            My needs in a digital camera were simple, or so I thought. I take a lot of photos, 10-15 or more rolls at a time, which can get very expensive when you take into account the cost of film, developing and printing. It is also time consuming, as I scan the best ones and print them out as 8 x 10s. Not to mention a pain, carrying lots of film, lenses, filters, etc. around with me. My aim was to save money and time, but I didn't want to sacrifice quality, either.

The Nikon Coolpix 990 takes excellent photos, and 8x10s print very nicely. I added a $400 flash card and that has plenty of room for lots of pictures (about 80 at fine quality), as poor shots can be deleted immediately. Downloading the pictures to my laptop is a breeze with the included usb cable (another review said that cut and paste doesn't work, but it works fine for me). It's rather heavy on batteries, but once I switched to rechargeable AAs there was a big improvement. One plus digital cameras have over film is being able to adapt to current lighting conditions - no fiddling with filters if taking photos indoors without a flash, for example. So far, I was very pleased.

I am pleased with the camera, and would recommend it, especially if most of your photos are taken outdoors or in bright indoor lighting. On my last trip I shot only two rolls of 35mm film. At this rate the camera will have paid for itself within the year in film and film developing savings, and it's worth its weight in gold for the time I save on scanning and retouching photos.
