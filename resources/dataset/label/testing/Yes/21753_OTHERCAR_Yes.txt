            I bought my car brand new on my 18th birthday.  Looking back, I do wish I had researched vehicles a little more extensively, but hey, I was 18, had my first real job, and needed a dependable car.

Overall the car has treated me great.  There is a little rattle in the dash that will NOT go away, so that can get quite annoying.  Another problem I have is that the drivers side floor mat eats away all the carpeting below it, and the teeth to hold the mat down disappeared quickly, quite a minor problem in the scheme of things, but still was very annoying.

I have only had one major problem.  At 3 1/2 years the radiator cracked and was not covered under warranty (another very annoying situation that cost me a chunk of money).

My car has very low mileage (about 41k at four years) so I'm sure that helps the car run more smoothly.  There is what sounds like a belt loose under the hood, but like the dash the technicians say nothing is wrong (I have been waiting for about a year for this squeak to cause me to breakdown, but so far so good).

A complaint I do have is the leg room.  I am 5'6" and sit with the seat all the way back.  When my 6'1" boyfriend gets in to drive, his knees hit the steering wheel, and he cannot adjust to make it more comfortable.  For me, it is fine, but for those of you taller, beware.  (He has no problems in the passenger seat).

Overall I am very pleased with my purchase, especially since the price was right.  I do wish I had been able to buy a different car, simply because I think it would lasted longer than my Cavalier, but at the time, it wasn't feasible.  So I do have minor regrets, but that is simply due to my predicting the future, not on what has happened thus far.

If you are looking to purchase a used Cavalier, make sure to just listen for that rattle (I know other Cavalier owners who complain of the same thing).  If you hear it, just decide whether or not it will eat at you, and just take all the other necessary precautions when buying it used.  Good luck!
