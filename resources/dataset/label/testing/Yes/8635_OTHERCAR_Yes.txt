            This review is strictly for skeptics, the category I was in when my daughter stopped at our home and announced she had just purchased a Kia.

Oh no... I thought to myself, how could she do that, as memories of another imported car, namely the Yugo, danced through my head.  Well I couldn�t burst her bubble, so Dad had to go out to the driveway and voice his approval (fat chance thought I, but I�ll be nice anyway).

If first impressions mean anything, I was shocked.  Could this rakish looking vehicle be a Kia?  Surely it had to be Japanese, I had never seen a Kia that looked this good.  As I peered inside, I was further impressed by the stylish cloth interior, matched only by its upscale appointments.  This car had every creature comfort you could want, again totally unexpected in a car priced well under $20,000.  

After all, I�m talking about a vehicle that appeared very Honda like, perhaps even better looking, for thousands less.  Not only that, how do you beat a 10 year - 100,000 mile warranty, which believe it or not, also includes 5 year unlimited milage roadside assistance.  It doesn�t get any better from a consumer protection standpoint.

By now yours truly went from just wanting a  ride, to man I gotta drive this thing.  That four cylinder engine couldn�t be any good could it?  Being the proud new car owner, my daughter was happy to oblige.

Here�s where I part company with the race fans of the world.  To me this automobile has a very smooth engine, one that�s well matched to the vehicle�s size.  Admittedly I�m talking about a 5 speed, and not the automatic version. But in my humble opinion, anyone that opts for the auto in a base four is foolish.  You can control the torque curve so much better with a stick shift.  And this car handles so well it begs to be pushed, within legal limits of course... A J Foyt I�m not.

Turning the ignition key caused the engine to jump to life instantly.  The Mazda built 149 HP four is relatively quiet, another pleasant surprise.  The trim level is excellent, the car feels much richer then its base price would indicate.  I felt acceleration was extremely good as the speedo jumped to 30 nicely with no visible strain.  The car held together well, as there wasn�t any noticeable vibration and practically no wind  noise at highway speed.  If I was looking for a vehicle in this price range, I don�t know if I�d look any further then the Optima.

Having said that, it�s my understanding Kia vehicles may not have a spectacular resale value.  The overall cost of ownership may come out the same as if you�d purchased a Honda and paid a higher initial cost.  Nevertheless I feel pretty certain Optima owners will be delighted with their purchase.  If your pocketbook is limited, make your first stop Kia, you�ll be pleasantly surprised.
