            Incredible does not do this camera justice. True, It costs near $2,500.00 when first introduced, but today (four years later) you can get one on Ebay or other auction sites for less than $200. This is a thousand dollar camera even today in performance, looks, feel and results. A true professional camera that beats nearly everything sold in the electronic stores today. Only 1million pixels, but the unique method of processing the photos on your computer adds the rest in to make 1200 X 1600 resolution photos that rival cameras sporting 4million pixels and more. What is even more incredible is the camera stores the raw ccd data on compact flash cards compressed with no loss of data. Meaning that this is the only camera out there that can store a couple hundred photos on a 30meg card that when processed on your computer are 5megs each at the 1200 X 1600 resolution.  The flash will light up the night at 20 feet. Battery life is average, but when used with high end 1800mh AA NIMHI cells or better, expect enough juice to take about 240 photos without flash or around 85 photos with flash. It's a shame that you don't see this kind of quality in the stores anymore. Learning curve is moderate.
If you can find one and learn how to use it, you'll be amazed. I have and use three of them and wouldn't sell at any price.  Note:  Lens is interchangable and so are the filters. Polariod had a winner, just didn't know how to market it.
