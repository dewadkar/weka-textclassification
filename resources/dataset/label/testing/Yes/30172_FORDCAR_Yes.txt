            Enough has been written for FORD Escape &#150 especially in consumer reports (www.consumerreports.org) and auto magazines, so I won&#146t bore you with technical and testing details.  Consumer Reports classifies Ford Escape as a very good vehicle to have.

Yes, I had just purchased this vehicle, though the next year&#146s model is coming out soon.  My understanding is that 2003 Ford Escape is something similar.  I had purchased the 2002 model for a variety of reasons.  I.E. Insurance is cheaper for one year old model.  

Before my purchase, I had looked into RAV4, Subaru Forester, and CRV.   I had disregarded them --- especially Toyota&#146s RAV4.  Though RAV4 is rated as #1 in Consumer Reports and it was classified as cute, I didn&#146t like Toyota&#146s company policy in Canada.  The company was not willing to provide incentives (i.e. rebate, accessories), though I was asking for every available accessories &#150 amounting to approximately $4,000.  So all together, I would have spent $40,000 (including taxes, etc).  I definitely wanted something in return if I was to spend that kind of money.  Too bad Toyota Canada was willing to let me go as a potential customer.  Another thing I didn&#146t like was the salesperson.  He had misled me in order to bring me back to the dealership.  I was told I could get a rebate and when I went in and after going through and wanting the accessories, the guy told me &#147&#133 I am sorry that you have misunderstood me&#133&#148  I politely excused myself and left.  I actually had a deposit cheque ready!  

A major reason of my buying the Ford Escape was actually the salesperson, Ed Schmidt, of Metro Ford Dealership in Calgary, Canada.  Ed was straight forward, had allowed me to demonstrate the smooth transfer on an uphill drive, was quite eager to assist me  and was quite organized in his presentation.  Apparently, he&#146s one of the best salespeople.

The spec I provided Ed included:
-	Yellow Ford Escape XLT &#150 Leather option
-	Side steps
-	Towing Package II
-	Extended Warranty
-	Pro-Pak (paint protection, etc)
-	Moon Roof
-	Tinted Windows

What I got was more than I asked for:
-	Mach Stereo System
-	Side Air Bags

The price I paid included the above, but I actually saved $2,400.  I was put into the category, X-Plan customers.  Incidentally, my requested model was scarce, so I was lucky to have this attractive and impressive vehicle &#150 Ed had done his magic!

Within four days of the initial contact, the vehicle&#146s key was in my hand.  Still, I thought this was too good to be true and I thought I most likely would receive a demo version &#150 but when the vehicle was presented to me, I was overwhelmed!  IT&#146S BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKED INCREDIBLY appealing, stud-ly, and attractive.  It&#146s definitely an eye-catching vehicle.

The Ford&#146s Finance people (Janice and Deany) were quite helpful --- they took time to make sure I was treated well.

Ed also took time to go over each function in the vehicle&#133was quite good to get an overview.  

The service didn&#146t stop when I left Ford&#146s parking lot &#150 I have scheduled maintenance checks / Tune Ups / Oil Changes in the upcoming years.   Ed&#146s service didn&#146t just end when he gave me the key!  He had assured me that I would be well-taken care of.  Well, I didn&#146t realize I would be testing his assertion.  I drove to a mall and for some strange reason, I turned on and off the engine and I was stuck in the middle of the parking lot.  AND the theft sign was flashing&#133I panicked especially when I couldn&#146t start the engine.   I called Ed and after listening to my panicky explanation, he calmly told me the problem.&#133I should have started the engine in PARK.    Okay, that was dumb of me and this was basically driver 101!  The bottom line was that Ed took time to understand my situation and was quite pleasant about the whole embarrassing situation.  I had also later found out that he came in on his day off &#150 just to deliver the vehicle to me!!!

Within one and a half days, I had driven over 400 KMs!  Here are my observations so far:
-	Smooth drive and turns.
-	The vehicle starts quite extremely quick&#133
-	The shifting control is right behind the wheel --- which saves space, allowing me to have room to put my drinks and area to hold miscellaneous items
-	The middle compartment (between front passenger seat and driver&#146s seat) has plenty of room to put maps, binders, keys
-	The full spare tire is actually inside and hidden
-	The back (not the back passenger seating area) could stack boxes of groceries!!!!
-	The interior doesn&#146t look cheap &#150 look quite luxurious.  When I drive the vehicle, I feel like I was sitting in an executive seat of an airplane
-	The front seats could be adjusted automatically &#150 when I slide the control, I could forward or move back the seat slightly or whatever length I need.  Ed is about 6� and I am about 5�&#133So the adjustment length definitely accommodates people of different extreme heights!
-	The steering wheel could be tilted!
-	The speed control is easy to adjust

In addition, I wasn&#146t sure if the parking spot in my apartment was reserved for me and there was a strict towing policy (vehicle in the wrong spot would be towed), so at 2:30 am, I drove the vehicle and parked somewhere next to the river.  Well, I stayed in the vehicle and I slept like a baby!!!  The seating was indeed comfortable and snuggly.  I know this was pretty extreme, but hey!  When I take a longer trip, I might have to sleep in the vehicle (since there might not be a motel/hotel around).  What better time to test the sleeping comfort?

Incidentally, I had also received Touch Up Kit (Honda would have charged me for this kit!!!), coupons for eight oil changes and an attractive YELLOW Metro Ford T-Shirt.

Would I recommend others to Ed and Ford?  This would be optimistically, thundering yes!

The disadvantage in having a Ford Escape is that I will have to buy new wardrobe to fit the impressive, athletic and sporty image that Ford Escape conveys!

BTW, my lady friend who was against the idea of my having a yellow escape was actually impressed with the design, the attractiveness, the smoothness, and the comfort!

PRICE:  $36,000 Canadian Fund

PS.  My insurance is actually cheaper for FORD than RAV4!

UPDATE:

I HAD SCRAPED MY SUV.  

I was exiting out of the parking lot -- to do that, I had to drive down slowly in a circular fashion to get to the bottom.  On my way down, this guy was coming toward me and he was speeding.  For me to avoid him, I had to drive close to the wall...and that's when I had scraped my SUV.

Thankfully, the rim above the wheels had protected my SUV's yellow paint.  The rim got the scrape and thanks to Eric's advice, I was able to clean up the paint (from the wall) that was on the rim.

SO THERE'S ANOTHER ADVANTAGE of having FORD ESCAPE...the rim's protection for the SUV's main body...I know if I did the scraping with a RAV4, I would have to pay $$$$ for the repaint.

-------------------------------------------

UPDATE No 2!  PIT STOP!

I was scheduled for a Pit Stop and I just couldn't believe the great treatment I had received!  Firstly, there was a parking stall specially reserved for me.  It had a BIG sign that showed 'Reserved for (My Name)'!

Ed had greeted me - with a fantastic demeanor - and had introduced me two people - service person and a mechanical guy, Dave and Mike.  While Dave was answering my questions, Mike was checking the pressure on the tires, lights, engine, internal items.  

I also got a lot of things too!  Locked gas cap, wind shield washer, touch up paint tube (previously, I had received a kit that contains highly concentrated car washing liquid, interior leather cleaner, car paint sealant, etc )!

I am very impressed!

Update #3:  Oil Change and The Great Adventure

Within 1.5 months, I had to have the first oil change, since the KMs had almost reached 4,200...and I was about to drive from Calgary, AB, to Vancouver, BC.

The oil change was smooth and fast.  I dropped it off at one and then picked it at three.  No fuss.  No mess.  The service people had made sure everything was checked, oil, engine, lights, etc.  There was no cost.

The plane ticket from Calgary to Vancouver is about $230Can.  The distance is about 950 KMs.  My entire trip costs only $110!  I had gone through rain, snow, and extremely sunny weather in cold temperature.

The whole trip involved quick turn maneuvers, stepping the accelerator in a fastest speed, etc.  The vehicle was fun to drive in!

In addition, I had brought back all kind of heavy items from Vancouver to Calgary. I.E. An AB bench. DVD player.  Speakers, a huge electronic piano keyboard, etc.  And there is still room for other things!

Not sure why, but I took many naps in the vehicle --- my little Capee was quite comfortable...that itself had saved me $$$ on motel bills.

So I am indeed glad that I had purchased Ford Escape!
