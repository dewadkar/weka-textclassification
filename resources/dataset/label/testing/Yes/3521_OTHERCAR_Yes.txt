            The picture quality of this camera is comparable to a handheld shoot and snap 35mm camera in my opinion - just what I was looking for.

At 2.1 megapixels and on the 8 meg ram compact flash card, you'll get 10 pictures at the best setting (which I prefer); however, you can get as many as 80 pictures on the lower quality settings.  The removable compact flash card is a plus, since you can buy these easily over the counter.  I will probably buy a 32 meg compact flash card so I can get around 30 pictures at the best setting.   I've seen compact flash cards up to 128 megs of ram - so your wallet is your limit.  Keep in mind though, the mid-range setting on this camera takes good pictures as well, I think most users would be well satisfied with the 20 pictures you can take on the 8 meg card at that mid range setting.  You can either use an external compact flash card reader (not included) or hook the camera up to the included USB cable (for iMac or USB PC and included) to transfer your pictures.  I've found that the compact flash card reader is much faster (and uses no battery power, as this camera does not come with the adapter but it can be purchased).  I would recommend buying rechargable batteries; however, I've been taking pictures all morning, about 150 pics, and the energizer lithium batteries (that came with it) are still showing strong on the display.

Update:  I now own 8 Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries that I use for this camera.  I think that this is more practical than buying the 50$ power adapter for the camera.  With the rechargeable batteries I always have batteries available as 4 are being charged while the other 4 are being used in the camera.  I'm very pleased with these rechargeable batteries.  

Some who have reviewed this camera here sound as if they are professional photographers that were being overly critical.  This camera is perfect for the average person or family that wants to take snap shots and get results that are similar to a point and shoot 35mm handheld camera.

At $299, and at 2.1 megapixels, it's going to be hard to beat this camera.  Some features you can turn on or off are red-eye reduction, the flash, a self timer, a 2.5x digital zoom, and a color LCD to look at the pictures.  I was not terribly impressed with the digital zoom, as it does distort the pixels (as do most digital zooms).  However you can purchase tiffen lenses and a dc-pro photosmart 315 catalog comes with it with many accessories.  I've ordered the package from them that includes a telephoto lens, wide angle lens, super close-up lens, bag, and adapter mount (for 97.95$) - the adapter mount apparently connects to the tri-pod mount on the bottom of the camera to allow for the external lenses.  I'll amend this review when I recieve this kit.

Update:  I have recieved the Tiffen closeup lens, telephoto lens, and wide angle lens for this camear.  A 20$ Tiffen adapter is required to use these lenses, and each lense will cost between 20 and 30$.  Overall, I would highly recommend the close up lens (many photo's on my homepage are taken with this lens).  The wide angle lens I rarely use and the Tiffen telephoto lens is only about 1.3x zoom, so I don't use it much either.


One thing that I did notice is that the color LCD is just a hair crooked, but nothing that substantially affects the photo's.

I have a webpage that is full of photographs that I've taken with this camera.  Infact, every photo on this page is taken with the HP 315 camera.  Go to http://web.mountain.net/~piziak.   


I use this camera on an Apple iMac.  There is no software installation required on the iMac.  Simply plug the USB cable into the camera, plug the other end into the iMac, and instantly a small disk icon appears on your screen that you can double click and access the JPG pics on the camera.  

Overall, I find this camera perfect for the average person.  It's certainly comparable in picture quality to a shoot and snap film camera.
