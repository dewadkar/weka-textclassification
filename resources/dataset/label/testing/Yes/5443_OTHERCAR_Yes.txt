            Just purchased 2002 Hyundai Elantra Auto GLS with package 3. MSRP was $14682, paid $12299. For a car that is this loaded, this is really an oustanding value.

At this price you get: AC, cruise, AM/FM/CD, Electric windows & door locks, etc.

The engine is very smooth, responds well to the throttle and is barely noticeable at both idle and cruise. At full-throttle it certainly makes a bit of noise, but all engines do.

Initial tank of gas out of the dealer's lot was 30 mpg at 70 mph and the AC running.

Cruise RPMS at 70 mph with the A/C running is a pleasant 2600 rpm... the engine really isn't working all that hard.

Steering is precise, not sloppy, and a joy.

Audio quality seems decent, but not outstanding on the AM/FM/CD player.

The driver's seat is adjustable 6 ways, which means you can fine tune the thing to get the exact seating position you prefer. On most other cars, I'm not comfortable for long trips.

Backseat has lots of room - for my three kids (6, 4, 2).

Dual airbags, and side airbags add a nice safety touch.

Only negative comment is the difficulty of finding the ABS/Traction control option.

Otherwise, if you need a compact-sized (really feels mid-sized to me) then this car gives huge value for the money.

All the reports (see Edmunds) indicate reliability has been quite good on 1999-2002 Elantra's.

Depreciation is bad, as with all new cars, but worse with Hyundai because of their name. However, if you want to keep and drive a car a number of years - who cares?

Buy the Hyundai and enjoy.
