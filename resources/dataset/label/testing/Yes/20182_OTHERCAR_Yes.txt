               This is the dream machine for me. At 17, I started out with a Ford Festiva which is basically a golf cart allowed on the highways if you ask me! But I was in high school and it fit five people to carpool. 


   After having two children, we upgraded to a Jeep Cherokee. Yes, it seemed bigger, but with two car seats, we had no room for friends or family. It wasn't very spacious at all and we were constantly having problems with it. I run a small child care business and when it came time to drive my children to kindergarten or any of their activities, I needed enough space to transport everyone. I had my mind set on either a Ford Windstar or Dodge Caravan, after driving both while the Jeep was in for some repairs. But my husband wanted the manly machine.

   We ended up taking his boss's Suburban up to the mountains. We fell in love with it. Two weeks later we bought one for ourselves. A nice red one with tan, leather interior. It seats 8 people and has enough cup holders to satisfy us all. We're not all cramped in when we have a full carload either. Everyone has lots of personal space. The trunk area is very large and I finally have enough room to hold my strollers AND a week's worth of groceries. We've helped two friends move instead of renting a U-Haul since the back and middle seats can fold down or be taken out to give us more room. The gas tank is huge! It takes $50 to fill it up but that's because it holds so much. We get great gas mileage beings it's such a big vehicle. We've taken it to Vegas a couple of times, San Diego tons of times and even took it across 6 states on a family trip. It runs great. It is very safe also. We were rear ended before we had even signed the papers on it and though the woman who hit us had her car all mangled in front, our back end had a little ding in the rubber part of the bumper that wasn't even noticeable. I feel safer in the suburban than I would in any other car, besides maybe a military one!  :o)

   I am so glad I didn't get my way for once. I would have hated being in a Windstar or Caravan after using the Suburban. It is THE perfect vehicle for families.
