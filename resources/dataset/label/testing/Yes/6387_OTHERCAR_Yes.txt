            We were very leery of purchasing a brand new model car.  Working in the medical device industry I am all too aware of the problems that can occur with neophyte products.  However, due diligence and research was done and we moved forward.  We are overall extremely happy with our XC90 and hope to be driving it 10 years from now.

As far as the exterior is concerned, it is hands down one of the best looking mid-size SUV's on the road.  Sporty, retro and classy all in one.

The interior is very roomy.  This is great for a 6'5" husband--and the person who has to sit behind him.  We test drove a lot of mid-size SUV's and found the majority of the competitors didn't have any more interior space than a car.  The exceptions were the BMW X5, which was a minimum $10,000 more and the Acura MDX which was the same price but didn't hold a candle to the Volvo for interior styling and luxury.  
The convenience of the third seat is very nice and it is large enough for women and children.  Simply fold it away or unfold it as needed.  In addition, all the seats, except the driver's, fold completely down which is nice for those big trips to "that home store".  
The 2/3-1/3 split tailgate is great.  Easy for loading/unloading groceries or plants from the garden center.  
The XC90 is easy to get in and out of.  The doors are wide but light weight and the seats are easy entry/exit.  I would steer clear of the running board.  It doesn't do much but get the back of your pants dirty or worse, put a run in your hose.
Of course, Volvo safety always comes into play and we most certainly feel very safe in this vehicle.  The side curtain and seat belt pretensors which protect third row passengers are very nice.

Road noise is minimal with the sunroof closed and as expected when open.  

As an average sized female, I initially found my left side driving visibility a little difficult due to the signature Volvo head restraints.  The only contender that beat the XC90 in this department was the Acura MDX and as I stated earlier, the interior didn't come close.  Given the extra safety the head restraints offer, I would make the same decision again.

The gas mileage has not met expectations.  The XC90 has averaged 16mpg overall.  This is annoying for someone who hates to stop for gas.  We considered the 5 cylinder for this very reason but were unsatisfied with the acceleration from a standstill.  

Now, the bad news.  We have experienced the same pause between first and second gear that "Piece of Mind at a Price" reported.  In addition, there is an occasional shudder between first and second gear.  Lastly, an intermittent problem of the XC90 taking off in third gear eventually became constant.  Since there were no errors in the system logs the service department was unable to find the problem.  The transmission is now being replaced.  

Our other car is a Honda Accord which we bought new--eleven years ago.  The XC90 was the second new car purchase we have ever made.  We may need to be patient while the last few bugs are worked through.  As stated earlier, I do love the XC90 and hope to be driving it in 10 years.  However, we tend to be intolerant of car problems, especially after paying so much.  After the transmission replacement we hope to not see the service department for a while, or a change of recommendation may be in order.

UPDATE 9/4/03:
We are now approaching the 6 month mark with our XC90.  When I first wrote the review we had just had the transmission replaced because it was stuck in "winter mode".  Since the service I have no new transmission issues to report.  In addition, I haven't had any more problems with the pause or shudder between first and second gear that I previously reported.
So, have I seen the inside of the service department since my initial report?  Yes.  Two issues were follow-up visits due to the transmission work.  A third trip was to have a break pedal sensor replaced.  This was very minor and did not affect driving (or breaking for that matter).
I am also very happy to report that my gas mileage is slowly improving.  I am up to 17+mpg from a previously reported 16mpg.  Still not stellar but getting better.

I still love the vehicle and have no desire to give it up.  However, I am still reserving judgment and will continue to update my report over the next few months.
