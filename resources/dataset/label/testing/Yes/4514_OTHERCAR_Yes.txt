            My husband bought a 1992 Tercel as a college student.  He needed something to get him around, but that wouldn't put him deep into debt. His investment has turned out to be a great one for our family.

Our '92 Tercel now has nearly 90,000 miles on it and it is still running as well as the day it was purchased.  We have never had serious mechanical problems with the car.  Part of this may be due to the regular check-ups, oil changes and tune-ups, but it has all been worth it.

This little car may not have all the luxuries of the larger Toyota cars, but I don't mind manually rolling down my window at a drive-through, so I am still a happy customer.  Our Tercel gets an average of 32 miles to the gallon at freeway speeds, and just under that when travelling around town. The engine is small, but the manual stick shift gives it a little more power than an automatic.

The ride is very smooth and quiet, especially considering it is a compact. It is a comfortable car with plenty of space in the front seats to relax and lounge during a long trip.

The only things I don't like, well, it is small, making it hard to get in and out of the back seat (it is a 2-door).  The back seat can get crowded because the seat is small and there isn't much space between the front seats and the back seat. Our particular model doesn't have air conditioning, although I know that is an optional feature.  Other than that, I really can't complain.  

This is a great vehicle for students or economy buyers. It is a great car, reasonably priced with the high Toyota standard of quality behind it.   <br><br>
