            I have actually wrecked two Corollas now, a 1996 and a 2000. The last one was really bad. A Jeep hit me on the front and side going 65mph. I walked away from the wreck with not so much as a bruise.

When I found out it was totalled, I headed straight for the Toyota dealer. Once there, I find that the Corolla was redesigned for 2001. Ok, I still want one. Well, I LOVE the new look, especially the new front end. They also made the cabin quieter. I like this since I have the lower end CE, with a three-speed transmission(no O/D) and it gets a little noisy at 70mph. I also really like the new upgraded upholestry and the face that every model has a trunk popper(this is important to someone that locked her keys in the trunk and had no trunk popper on her 2000 model!)

The only downsides I see are the small backseat. I tried to put three carseats in there. Not happening! There is not much legroom. The good thing is that there are three shoulder belts. This is important because lap belts are not safe for anyone. Another minor problem is the car kind of "jumps" around a bit in high winds. This is more a hassle than anything.

Other than that, I love this car and would recommend it to anyone!
