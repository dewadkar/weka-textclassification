            The Mitsubishi Montero Sport has got to be the coolest sport utility vehicle I've ever driven.  I don't own one personally, but I know a lot of people that do.  The Montero Sport is definitely a keeper. I'd recommend this baby to anyone. 
The first thing you notice about the Montero Sport is the sleek and sporty look of the exterior.  It looks sturdy and firmly structured, which gives it the obvious look of an SUV.  But on another note, it has a very unique shape to it, one that gives it the classy sophisticated look that I've come to love so much.  There are also a big variety of different colors to choose from, and just about all of them look decent. 
The interior is also very nice.  There is so much room in those things! The first time I rode in one, I took about an hour &amp; 1/2 road trip, and ended up sitting in the back.  I've honestly never traveled by car that comfortably, and didn't mind the long trip at all.  The leather seats are a bonus; they look nice and feel really comfortable too.  
The ride in that SUV is so smooth.  It's like you're not even moving.  There is absolutely no annoying sounds coming from the car.  I love that about the Montero Sport, since things like random car noises tend to bug me. 
Over all, the Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a great sport utility vehicle to own.  I'm actually considering buying one myself.  Maybe you should consider buying one too :) <br><br>
