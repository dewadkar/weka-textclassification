            I just got my 2000 Honda Odyssey after taking long time in making decision about Odyssey. I looked around for lot of minivans and test drove most of them and came to the conclusion that Honda Odyssey provide best features and car for it�s money. Honda's V6 is smooth and quiet, though it makes its presence known under full acceleration. The automatic transmission works well. It doesn�t have problem like other Honda cars of hesitating to sift. In most situations, the Odyssey delivers a smooth, comfortable ride. Fuel economy is average. It would have been really good if it had better fuel economy (one of the important point for me). 

Odyssey size is perfect for minivan...not too large and not too small. A large, roomy interior is a direct benefit of the Odyssey's size. The nice design of being able to remove second row seat and being able to fold and hide third row seat gives lot of room if you want to carry some big stuff. Power sliding doors that come on the Odyssey EX are easy to operate. Either door can be open or closed by pressing a button on the dash or key fob or by moving the inside or outside levers on the door.

It delivers a load of convenience and is easy to live with. The Odyssey is an excellent vehicle for a family of five or six. I really love it. <br><br>
