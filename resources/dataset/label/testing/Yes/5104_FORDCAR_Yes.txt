            With all of this Ford sucks mumbo jumbo, I have been extremely surprised with my 1997 Ford Taurus.  The Taurus is a mid sized car.  It's small enough to handle easily and big enough to feel quite safe on the road.  

The giddy-up-and-go of the Taurus is amazing.  It's almost too good.  I've found myself going 90mph quite unknowingly on many occasions!

I have noticed some iffy transmission &quot;things.&quot;  Sometimes the shifting is a bit funny feeling.  I know these technical terms must be hard to follow, but stay with me here.  

The Taurus is a bit funny looking too.  I call it the eggmobile.  :)
On the whole, I like this car.  It runs decently, it's semi-sporty looking, and it's goes pretty fast.  The price is reasonable too-- a major plus.<br><br>
