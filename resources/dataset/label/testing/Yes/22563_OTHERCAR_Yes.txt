            &#147Because I can&#146t stop loving you, because I can&#146t stop loving you" 
You probably recognize the Avalon commercial. Avalon means earthly paradise. Well when you step in this car you now have entered an earthly paradise of comfort, quality and a whole lot more. Let&#146s get right down to what makes this car an Avalon 

Exterior 
At first look you wonder if the car was design for looks or for aerodynamics. I think a little bit of both. With it smooth looking front and its bold looking back. This car has the appearance of two designs rolled into one this can be a good thing. At first I didn&#146t like it but I got use to it as time went on. When I bought the car and took it out on the highway. I was really hesitant to kick that puppy up. But after a couple months I finally took it on its speed run. I drove it at 105 mph on the interstate and the whole car handled fine the steering was still, steady and accurate the car didn&#146t shake or make any sudden movements. In fact if you didn&#146t look down at the speedometer you would never know your going 105 mph. That right of the bat gave me some idea at how well this car was made. Between the aerodynamics, paint and high speed control. I give exterior and A+.

Interior Electronics 
What can I say GPS, CD, COMPASS, Dual Airbags, Passenger Rear Air conditioning. I could almost write a book as to how many features this car has. You can lock all 4 doors from the driver side key whole by turning the key left two times. The cruise control is amongst the smoothest I have seen. With dead point accuracy, The Speakers are positioned in the right places. You feel like you&#146re in a symphony hall. With beautiful highs and nice rich deep lows and clarity that is awesome. It has the auto shift mirror so that the mirror shifts when night time comes. I could keep going on but let&#146s just say the Avalon is fully loaded. 

Comfort and Interior. 
The console is perfectly designed. With cup holders that can hold any drink large to small. Theirs plenty of CD holders I think. Very sturdy console construction the gear shift is firm and solid and you won&#146t doubt that you&#146re not in gear. The console layout to me is a work of art and should be in a painting. Everything is laid out where you expect it to be. Your sun glasses can be stored right above the mirror. This generally is nice because it gets it away from everything. As far as the interior goes everything was done right. The seats are elevated and tilted back perfectly. You almost want to fall asleep because they did such a great job of aligning the seats. They have you elevated perfectly to see the road as well. The backs seats are no exceptions they are just as comfortable and you will be wondering which ones you think are the most comfortable. The windows are perfect height and level. The seat belts can be adjusted for your height. The air conditioning is great. You can crank that thing up and have it be really artic cold. Or you can crank the heat up and feel nice, warm and toasty. The amount of air that blows out of the vents is awesome. You feel like you&#146re in a wind tunnel. I hardly ever use max when running the air conditioning. 

Performance. 
I had a 3.0. I think they heavily optimize it to get every bit a power out of it. And it really shows. The engine is smooth and powerful. I notice no hesitation when you put the pedal to the metal. Also the engine never jerks bangs or nothing it is very smoothly programmed. The gear ratio is about the best I've seen on a car. 

Reliability. 
I have had mine since the 2003's came out. All I have to replace on it was the tires because by accident I ran over glass. Toyota quality is all you really need to know. I've had many Toyota&#146s in the past that I have traded them in. Do to the fact that they lasted so long. On any other non Toyota car I&#146ve had it went off to the junk yard. So I think that gives you some idea of Toyota quality. 

Quality and Overall 
The quality is about the best I've seen. No shortcuts were notice in this car.  Everything was very well thought out. And I think in the end you will be a very happy person that you bought it.
