            I upgraded to the <b>Nikon CoolPix 995</b> after my CoolPix 950 BROKE just as I was about to take some important pictures, so the first recommendation I will make to buyers is to GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY from whatever retailer you purchase it from.  In my case, Best Buy credited the purchase price of my 950 toward the 995 without any hassle, and I paid the difference.  Looking back, I wonder if I should have considered other cameras, but having used the 995 for a while now, I�m glad I stuck with Nikon.

The quality of the Nikon digital cameras is superb.  I have seen some fantastic photography online done with the 950, 990, and 995 by pros and serious amateurs.  It is inspiring, since I know that my equipment won�t hold me back from making great pictures� only my limited skills will.  In that vein, another recommendation I will make to buyers of CoolPix cameras is to join the <b>Nikon CoolPix Group on Yahoo! </b>  It is an active group, and I have learned many valuable tips from it.  Check out:

Here�s another one specifically for 995 users:

The first one is more active, and gives the 995 owner a sense of community and support from other users.

The 995 itself has some great features.  My favorites are:
<b>Swivel Lens</b> - this is the reason I bought the 950 in the first place.  I take photos at concerts, and being able to hold the camera over my head and still see the LCD was the big selling point for me.  Plus it looks cool.  Everyone instantly recognizes a CoolPix 950/990/995 because of the swivel lens.  The 995 has a swivel lock too, so if you attach an �extender� or other lenses, the weight of it won�t make your lens �droop.�
<b>Quick Play</b> - you can view photos you just shot while still in shooting mode.  You don�t have to switch over to Play mode to make sure the shot was OK.
<b>Continuous Shooting</b> - this is the rapid-fire mode, which allows you to shoot up to 10 or so shots within a few seconds by holding down the shutter release button.  In bright light or outdoors, you can almost get some decent action photography shots.
<b>ISO Control</b> - you can go up to ISO 800, which is pretty noisy (grainy), but allows you to get some low-light shots you couldn�t get otherwise.  Usually I try not to go over ISO 400.  (Your choices are AUTO, 100, 200, 400, and 800, but AUTO will only choose between 100 and 200).
<b>Macro Mode</b> - I have done some very interesting macro shots since the lens can focus down to about 2 inches.  The drawback is the flash won�t work in macro mode, neither will the auto-timer.
<b>Mucho Megapixels</b> - the 995 takes some hi-res photos, which is great, but sometimes the time it takes to save a shot to the card will cause you to miss the next shot.  Thus Continuous Shooting comes in handy, but then you have to wait for it to save ten hi-res shots, which can take a good 20 seconds or more.  This might be remedied with a �faster� CompactFlash card.

My biggest gripe with the 995, which I didn�t experience with the 950 is that sometimes I�ll get a strange red cast in my low-light photos.  The LCD display will become almost unreadable, and it seems no matter what settings I try (in Manual mode) once it�s �gone red� there�s no remedy but rebooting.

Another small caveat for those upgrading from a 950 is that the 995 uses a proprietary Li-Ion battery pack, so the investment I made in rechargeable AA batteries cannot be used with the 995.  I liked having plenty of recharged batteries, and the CoolPix cameras are battery hogs, so I still need a backup battery for the 995.  Just something to be aware of.

The other minor gripes are that the 995 doesn�t come with a carrying case like the 950 did, and it�s bulkier form factor means I can�t fit it into a coat pocket any more.  I found a small shoulder-strap case that works for me.  It also would be nice to have a stronger optical zoom, which other cameras in this price range now offer.

Last thing I�ll mention is that you�ll want a <b>large-capacity CompactFlash card</b>.  The 16MB card that comes with the 995 will fill up quickly on the higher resolution settings.  I recommend at least 128MB, which have dropped in price recently.  You�ll also want a CompactFlash card reader, so you don�t drain your battery downloading photos from the camera directly.

Overall, I love the CoolPix line of cameras, and I think the investment has been well worth it. If you�re going to get a digital camera, get one that has features you can grow into as a photographer.  The CoolPix 995 is an excellent choice for those serious amateurs and �prosumers� that want a feature-rich camera with good quality optics and plenty of manual controls.

The Bottom Line:
The <b>Nikon CoolPix 995</b> is a good upgrade to the <b>Nikon CoolPix 950</b>, but it would be nice to have even more optical zoom and a carrying case included.
