            I purchased my 98 sidekick because was advertised at lowest price I'd seen
a4+4 in last 20 years. I've carried mail rt. in very rural wv for last 20yrs. I've had several jeeps and 1 bronco. This sidekick will match any of them. My roads go from mud to sand,water,ice,snow,dust,rocks,bumps,and about a thousand stops a day. I can't find anything bad this vehicle,except my wife wants to drive it all the time! I have a friend or to thats tried to tear there sidekicks up and they say tuffest 4+4 ever owned. I love the gas mileage,mine about 28(on mail rt.).   If your never going to use 4 wheel drive and drive interstate all the time buy a car. If you want to go instead of blow,then a sidekick is the way to go!!               <br><br>
