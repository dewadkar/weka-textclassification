               I just bought a 1999 Toyota Camry LE a couple months ago.  I make a point of doing my research before I make any large purchase and this car has to be the most bang for the buck.  It's basically the #1 most reliable care on the market.  It's also very comparible to the Lexus ES (without a woodgrain dash and leather interior of course).  
   
   I just made a weekend trip from L.A. to Las Vegas and took the long way home throughout the desert, so I had plenty of time to really familiarize myself with the car. I'll start by saying the interior of the car is both spacious and quite comfortable.  It's a car you will surely enjoy taking long trips in.  My favorite features are the dual cup holders, which fit Starbucks cups perfectly without spilling even over a bump or two.  The sunglass holder is just overhead near the windshield, which also makes a handy cell phone holder and there is a small tray on the left near the driver door that is perfect for spare change, or a pack of ciggarettes for those of us who are smokers.  There is also plenty of room in the back seat so 4 or 5 folks can surely travel in comfort.  The amount of trunk space is also very impressive on the Camry.  Not only is the trunk huge, but the seats fold down flat for even more space.

    My Camry is equipped with the CD/Cassette premium sound system which is very impressive.  It's exceptionally clear sound, with deep bass and crisp highs.  

   The ride is very smooth.  I have the 4cyl 2.2 and I must say, the power is impressive.  You will be reminded that it is a 4cyl when heading up a steep grade for long periods of time,  but on shorter hills around town, no matter how steep, you'll be suprised of the power.  The steering is tight and the car handles wonderfully.  

   As I mentioned in the cons, the only problem I know of with Camrys is the brakes.  I started noticing a squeak or a howl or two here and there so I asked a friend who owns a chain of auto service centers about the problem.  He indicates that the factory brakes are known to do that and replacing them with higher quality ceramic or other aftermarket brakes should surely solve the problem. 

    To sum it up without regergitating all the specs of this car, it's basically a very luxurious automobile.....in casual clothes.  It's both practical, and impressive.
