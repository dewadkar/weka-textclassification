            I made the move to digital with my camera last year when our baby was born.  I knew we would be taking a lot more pictures that usual and that we would want to email them around the world.

The FinePix 1400 is the camera I chose after a couple of weeks of research.  Let me start with the positives.

The color is great, with the blues and reds sharp.  We have had them developed on-line at amazon and shutterfly.com and also printed them out on our old HP printer.  In both cases the color was as nice as they would be developed at the store.  For printing anything under 4x6 looked as sharp as prints we already had, but 5x7 started to look slightly fuzzy in areas.  

The LCD screen on the back is in the center so your nose doesn't smudge it up when you are not using it which is great.  The buttons are a little small but well placed and very easy to use.  It is simple to change from one print quality to another and erasing pictures in a simple two step process.

The zoom works great and is optical not digital so you don't loose any quality while zooming in.

The best thing about digital?  You don't end up hating half of the roll of film you have shot.  Just erase the pictures that don't turn out how you want them.

Negatives

Only comes with a 4 MB card which can hold about 6 of the highest quality photo's.  I would recommend buying a larger size, I have a 64 mb which holds about 55 photos.

The batteries go really fast.  I would get some rechargables that you can use over and over or you will have to buy batteries every other week.

Shaky pictures.  If I don't hold the camera absolutely steady the pictures are a mess.  In fact, I have started using a tripod for most of my photos.  I am playing with the settings a little to see if I can fix this.
