            Note: This review is for the 2001 Lexus RX 300 4WD w/navigation option.

I recently upgraded from a 1999 Lexus RX 300 to a 2001 Lexus RX 300 4WD Navigation model. It's silver/gray with Black Leather interior. Luxury options include GPS navigation, heated seats, RDS Audio, Wood accented steering wheel and gear knob, and a new spoiler. Other extra and changes from the 1999 model include a full size spare tire, a larger 19 Gallon gas tank, a new front grill, a runner on the bumper in back, and yet ANOTHER cup holder that folds out from the middle of the back seat.

While the 1999 RX 300 was a great SUV, it had a few shortcomings that have been address in this the new 2001. Most notably the excessive wind noise from the sun roof has been considerably reduced and, in the navigation model, the Stereo Controls are much more intuitive.  Other than that, it still drives and handles quite well in many conditions. And of course, for most of us, that simply means getting from point A to point B (Not necessarily off-roading or sport driving, as one might expect from an SUV.)

The navigation screen, while a bit small, provides all the feedback a user needs: Mapping, audio, maintenance schedule, and other car preferences. All available via touch-screen.

Being GPS equipped the computer does an excellent job at knowing where you're at and which direction your going. I tested several different addresses in all kinds of obscure places and it always found them! Even if it's on the other side of the country, it only takes about 5 seconds to map out a route to your destination. You can specify a destination by exact street address, by intersection, or specific point of interest (such as &quot;Golden Gate Bridge&quot;).

When it calculates a route, it gives your 3 choices depending on your set-up options and desire to use freeways (or not). Once you chosen your route the computer will tell you to proceed to the spot shown on the screen (usually a very close by intersection) to start the trip.

The cool thing about the guide is that she's got a very pleasant voice and it's mixed right in with the audio. So if you're listening to the stereo or whatever, it'll just speak right over the music. You can adjust her volume if you listen to the music a little louder than normal.

As you approach turns and intersections, she will let you know which lane to be in and what to expect when you get there. For instance, if you exit on the right, but then need to immediately stay to the left AFTER the exit, she'll tell you that. This is accompanied by a overview of the upcoming intersection on the screen as well. This is very nice for driving at night or when it's hilly, so you understand the layout of what's coming up ahead.

If you decide to change your route or take a different exit, the computer will quickly re-calculate a new route, and will continue to do so if you change your mind again. This is also true if you see a spot that you want to stop at as a Way Point. Just point to it with your finger and set it, and it'll calculate your route via that Way Point.

Should you find yourself hungry for Chinese food, simply press the POI (Point of Interest) button and you can have the display show you all the Chinese food places within the visible map area. POIs include, ethnic restaurants, ATMs, Gas Stations, and more! A real boon when traveling in an unfamiliar locale.

Another great feature is the addition of all the audio features to this touch-screen command center. All the buttons for the CD-Changer and Audio Settings are displayed here. One new feature is the addition of RDS to the stereo system. This Radio Data System picks up special signals sent out by some radio stations that include it's call letters, music genre, and emergency info. One touch of the RDS Scan button and it instantly finds all the RDS stations and you can, for instance, only display all the Easy Listening stations in your area (that are broadcasting RDS, mind you).  This is an especially useful feature if you're in a new city and your don't know the radio stations. RDS also features a special &quot;TRAF&quot; feature which will automatically interrupt your CD/Radio listen to give you important traffic and emergency updates along your route.

Maintenance scheduling is included on a separate screen so you can keep track of when you're due for the next oil change, air filter change, etc... You can even program it for Birthday reminders!

There are only a couple small interface issues I have with it. One being that you cannot access certain functions while the car is moving. This is obviously done for safety reason, since they don't want the driver searching for trivial information while driving. For instance, while driving you can change route information and set a way point, but you cannot set up a destination or specific address. If I'm going on a long trip, I almost always have a companion with me in the car, and it would be nice if they could access the information while on the road, instead of having to pull off and stop.

Also, every time you start the car up the screen same something to the effect of: &quot;You agree not to operate this navigation system if it's unsafe&quot;. You have to press the &quot;I agree&quot; button on the screen before you can start using the system. Obviously, something installed to appease the lawyers, but does it have to ask EVERY time?

Over all, it's exactly the Luxury SUV that I was looking for. It's got the bells and whistles that I like, along with the safety features I need. And it's really fun to drive!
