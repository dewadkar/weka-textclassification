            I purchased my ZX2 in July of 1999.  It is equipped with the HOT package, and to be honest with you, it was love at first sight.  Not only do I love the looks of the car, but since it has the 15' wheels courtesy of the hot package, the car handles wonderfully.  It gets great gas mileage too, and that was very important to me since I spend a lot of time commuting.  I highly recommend this car to first time buyers, it is fairly inexpensive, and I was able to keep my payments in a decent price range.  It is a very fun car, great for students and singles.
