            Not only has my A4 been a fun car to drive, the Quattro version does great in the Colorado snow.  But be sure you get the all-season tire, because the high-performance tires don't do well in winter driving weather at all.

The pleasant surprise, however, has been the great service that Audi dealers provide.  Free oil changes for the first three years, they detail the car every time it's serviced and loaner cars are easily available at no cost.  I thought maybe that I had just stumbled on a good car dealer, but looking at some of the reviews of dealers...it seems Audi dealers in general tend to rate at the top of their class.

Try it...you'll like it!<br><br>
