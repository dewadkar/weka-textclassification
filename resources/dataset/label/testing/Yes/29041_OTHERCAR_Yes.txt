            Easy to get in.
Easy to get out.
Easy to drive.
Easy on gas money.
If you have a difficult time getting in and out of a car, the Honda CR-V should be high on your list to look at.  The seats are just at the right level to slid in and out of the car without lifting or lowering yourself.  The CR-V drives easier than a car, it has a much smaller turning radius, and the added advantage of real time 4-wheel drive helps keep you under control.  If you are looking for an off road work horse to haul trailers and negotiate logs, look elsewhere.  The Honda CR-V is an excellent in city car that has the Honda reliability, it is not a huge SUV that is awkward to drive and gets good gas mileage (for a SUV).  The turning radius makes the CR-V easy to maneuver in and out of traffic, park, and easy to get in to your garage.  With the real time 4-wheel drive, taking off at oil slick intersections or driving on compact snow and ice is no longer a hair raising experience.  You can feel when the 4-wheel drive kicks in....then you just sort of smile and keep on Driving. The only down side I have with the Honda CR-V is the door locking system.  You can only lock and unlock all of the doors from the drivers side...If the model you are looking at does not have remote key entry...don't buy it until it does.
