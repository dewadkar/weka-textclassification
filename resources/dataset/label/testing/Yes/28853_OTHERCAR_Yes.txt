            It's easy to use. It has to be, because I use it.

I'm not near as machine oriented as my husband. He knows how to use all kinds of cameras and gadgets. But technically inclined, I am not.

So if I'm going to use it, it had better be real easy to operate. And this Kodak 210 camera is.

It took me a few tries, but I can even connect it to our computer and take the pictures off the camera with the software that was included.

Even my hisband was proud of me when I did that. So, ladies, don't be afraid of the Kodak 210. 

You can use it. You can print the pictures from it. You will feel proud that you are at least somewhat up to date on the latest electronic equipment.<br><br>
