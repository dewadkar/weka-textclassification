            **UPDATE ON REVIEW**
STILL GOING STRONG AT 115,000 MILES AND 3 YEARS LATER!
***END OF UPDATE**

I've had my F150 for over a year now.  I bought the truck used with 48,000 miles on it (one-owner).  I currently have 82,000 miles.  It's a very dependable truck in some ways, but a hassle in other ways.

SPECS:
1996 Ford F150 XL Regular Cab
300 6-Cylinder, Manual Transmission
Long Wheel Base, Dual Gas Tanks

PROS:
1. The truck can pull just about anything.
2. It drives excellent, no shakes or rattles.
3. Parts are inexpensive and easy to find at any local parts store.
4. The interior is comfortable, I have cloth seats and carpet flooring.
5. The stereo system sounds great, two front speakers and two rear.
6. Insurance rates are low.
7. It's easy to work on, if you are mechanically inclined (lots of room under the hood).

CONS:
1. One of the pulleys for the belt has a tendency to become worn and make an awful sound, it has to be replaced: cost about $15.
2. It guzzles gas!  About 14-15 miles per gallon.  There are two tanks on mine, but they don't get me very far.
3. The brakes had to be replaced at 50,000 miles, now my rims are always covered with brake dust.

Yes, there are more pros than cons, but the gas guzzling counts as more than one con.

If your looking for a dependable used truck this is the one, but take the gas mileage into consideration before making a decision.
