            I've had my new 2000 E430 4matic for about a month now. I couldn't be happier, with the car. The dealer I'm a little less thrilled about, but you're here to hear about the car... so here we go.

This is the car that BMW will never be able build. I've had 4 BMW cars and one BMW motorcycle. All great vehicles. Love them. I've also had two Audi Quattro cars. The Mercedes-Benz E430 4matic is a cross between the two brands... but this one is taken to a higher level and on steroids at the same time. It feels like it was carved out of a solid block of Platinum according to one of my friends. 

This E430 4matic is Brilliant Silver (a classic Mercedes-Benz color) over Charcoal, and came with Xenon headlights, headlight washers, heated seats, sunroof, memory seats, and a CD player that has it's own fiber optic network. 

One other key feature is Tele-Aid. I highly recommend it. It's an SOS system that doesn't require you to have a cell phone and it has an integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) so your car can be constantly tracked if it is stolen or you are in an accident. During the first 300 miles I put on the car I got a bad tank of gas, but I didn't know it. The gas was filled with rust and water. This was obviously not the fault of Mercedes-Benz. Amazingly the car kept going... seemed to be running on 2 cylinders though. I called Tele-Aid and they set up an immediate conference call with a Mercedes-Benz tech person... and this was on a Sunday! He said it sounded like bad gas! He nailed it. Talk about great customer service. I limped to the dealer and the problem (non-warranty) was fixed in a day and a half! Kudos to Phil Smart Mercedes-Benz (not where I bought the car) for fixing it right the first time and keeping me informed on the progress.

The car handles better than any Mercedes-Benz I have driven. The combination of 17&quot; wheels, low profile all-weather tires, and 4matic all wheel drive make this a 'stick to the road' car. Even through the curves. I'd recommend the 4matic option even if you don't live in the mountains or near snowy areas. The E430 also has a very short turning radius. Great for a car of this size. There is no comparable BMW and the Audi A6 is closer to a Passat in size while the A8 is closer to an S Class Mercedes-Benz. There's also resale value to consider, a place where Mercedes-Benz has always shined brightly. 

The Xenon headlights are nothing short of amazing. They throw a tremendous amount of bright light and once you use them you will never go back to the old technology. And they don't blind oncoming traffic. 

The seats are to die for. Even without the Contour option. They are roomy and the leather is excellent. 

The radio system is fully integrated with the Tele-Aid system. It automatically 'mutes' when you make a Tele-Aid call. I've read many complaints about Mercedes-Benz car audio but the E430 comes with the upgraded Bose system... and the sound is superb. 

I will be driving this car for quite a while.
