            This Epinion is not about the truck but about a service.  The service is &quot;Ford-Diesel.com&quot;.  It is one of the best websites ever.  If you own a Ford Diesel, you should definitely check out this site.  It is similar to &quot;Epinions&quot; but it is only for Ford Diesels.

You can look at product or trucks, write columns about them or read them to find information on them from other people.  They have great links, columns, reviews, products, and much more.  They also have screen-savers, and desktop wallpaper.  

I encourage everyone to use it.  I have found many things for my truck that I have wondered if they existed.
