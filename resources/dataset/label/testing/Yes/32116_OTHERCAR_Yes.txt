            Looked at cars for 2 weeks, test drove VW Passat, Mercedes C, Honda Accord, and other vehicles Jeep Grand Cherokee etc.  This is the only American car I really considered.  Test drive was impressive, almost European, especially with the handling package.  Liked the bigger interior size and good looks.  But the real clincher is the 0.9% financing! You can put the price of a fully equiped Accord ($24K) in a fund that yields 7% and pay for this car at $29,600 over 60 pmts.  Its a lot more car than the Accord.  Buy the handling package, upgraded stereo, and moon roof!<br><br>
