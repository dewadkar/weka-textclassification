            Most of the time people complain about the Chevy Astro, they say it &quot;rides like a truck&quot;  Well YEAH!  it IS a truck.  You can haul a hell of a lot more than any minivan on the market.  I've had my '93 Astro since '97 and I LOVE it.  I've only moved once, a queen size mattress and box spring will fit flat with the seats removed. You'd be amazed how much you can fit in one of these.  I had mine lowered 4 inches all around, with American Racing Equipment basket wire wheels, nice whitewalls, bumpin' system.  It's the pimp van.  These are the only mini/midsize vans that actually look good when they're lowered and customized.  Saw one with 20-inch wheels on it once, it looked PHAT!  There's nothing wrong with the Chevy Astro unless you don't like the size, in which case you should have bought a station wagon, ya weenie.<br><br>
