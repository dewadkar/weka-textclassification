              Based on the all new 2003 Toyota Corolla's platform, Toyota has has introduced an all new vehicle for the 2003 model year; titled 'Matrix' (like the movie). The Matrix, in a way, is like the PT Cruiser and other sport utility wagons in the sense that they are able to haul almost anything your average SUV could, yet retains more of your typical car like feel, ride, and in the Matrix XRS's case, a large dose of fun. (The same can be said about the Matrix's sister car, the Pontiac Vibe, which carries the same optional powertrains, transmissions, etc.) The 2003 Matrix definitely caters to more of a younger crowd than the PT Cruiser/Subaru Outback. The price is cheaper, and the overall marketed character of the Matrix is set almost solely on performance vs its usefulness as a practical on-road utility vehicle.

For the 2003 model year the Toyota Matrix comes in 3 trim lines; the Base, XR, and XRS. AWD is featured as an option in 2 of the lesser trim lines; the Base and XR, however the top of the line XRS (tester) is not available with this feature. Engines include 2 1.8 liter DOHC engines and 3 different engine outputs. The AWD models come with the the Corolla's 1.8 producing 123 HP, the FWD XR comes with the same 1.8 producing 7 more horses, while the top of the line XRS comes with a slightly different, and highly tuned DOHC VVTL-i 1.8 producing 180 horsepower at 7,600 RPM, and 130 lb-ft of torque at 6,800 RPM. Transmissions include a 4-speed automatic, a 5-speed manual in the Base and XR trim lines, and a standard 6-speed manual in the XRS (equipped in tester). 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

 When I reviewed the Pontiac Vibe back in May 2002 I had some minor gripes with the powertrain, these gripes are carryovers with the Matrix. I appreciate the nature of this high revving 1.8 liter VVTL-i engine in both the Matrix and Pontiac vibe, however I still feel a small rev happy 6-cylinder would be more appropriate for these utility vehicles, but as it stands the 1.8 VVTL-i engine offers far more excitement than the PT Cruiser's naturally aspirated 2.4, the 2.5 in the Subaru Legacy, and the 2.0 in the Mazda Protege 5, so I'm not complaining too much. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is a tad slow going at first, but once the revs pick up this vehicle's engine is reminiscent of the Acura Integra Type R and many of Honda's small high revving 4-cylinders with their amazing power outputs. This means the Matrix is fast, it just needs its lower gears and a heavy foot to reach its power band which comes into full action between 5,000-9,000 RPM. 'Slightly' like a turbo, the Matrix acts like a normal car under partial throttle, however when you stomp on the gas pedal be prepared for performance that was once offered from Toyota only in cars like the mid engined MR2, the Supra, and the current generation Celica, certainly power unexpected in a vehicle like the Matrix. The 6-speed manual transmission is a bit clunky, and a bit hard to reach, (it juts out of the bottom dash like an appendage, which ends up being too far forward) yet provides excellent close gear ratios which aids in quick acceleration. I also liked the throws of this shifter, while not exactly a 'short throw shifter' it provided short enough throws for aggressive driving. 

<b>Might be a gripe?:</b> When the Matrix XRS is put in reverse the car beeps like a company utility truck on the inside, yet makes no useful noise on the outside. This feature makes little sense to me as how it's going to prevent an accident. Do drivers no longer know when they are driving in reverse? 


One positive aspect of having such a small displacement engine is the luxury of hardly any torque steer on take-off. Unlike many FWD cars i.e, the 2.5 liter Nissan Sentra, the Matrix is kept on track under full throttle with minimal torque steer.
While the Matrix may be quiet at idle, in-fact it's virtually vibration free, the Matrix XRS's 1.8 liter engine is a full blown screamer under full throttle. If you like quiet vehicles the Matrix is most likely not going to be on your shopping list. Unlike the relatively quiet PT Cruiser, the Toyota Matrix's engine makes its presence known each time you press on the throttle in the form of your typical, small, high performance, Japanese engine.

  <b>Handling</b> is about what I had expected. Having driven the Vibe GT I knew what I was getting into. The Toyota Matrix could do with some improvements in the handling department, but for a car in this class, and taking the height of this vehicle into consideration, the Matrix handles better than one would expect. The steering is excellent, however body roll/lean can be prevalent, but usually only during aggressive driving on twisty roads. Relatively wide, low profile P205/55R 16s tires come standard which aid in grip and overall stability and composure of this vehicle. 

  The Matrix is not exactly a smooth cruiser. At speeds above 55 MPH the Matrix suffers from mild wind and roadgrain noise, although the killer here is engine noise. If you keep the shifter in 6th gear and under 55 MPH the engine remains calm, but quickly after 55 MPH the powertrain starts to show its underpinnings in the form of severe engine noise. If the 6-speed was a bit taller geared this probably would reduce some of this unnecessary noise. As if regular cruising wasn't loud enough, the Martix is almost annoying on hills and when making quick passing maneuvers at high speeds. Many folks will probably find the sound of this engine very inviting, especially those of us who like the sound of a healthy high revving 4-banger, however I personally did not like this type of attitude coming from a vehicle like the Matrix. The low geared transmission does aid in somewhat good hill climbing in high gear, although inclines (above 5% in grade) will require a down-shift into 5th gear which is very subtle thanks to the close gear ratios. 
The suspension is relatively stiff, yet doesn't make for a rough ride on poor surfaces; rattles and squeeks are next to none.

 Even though the Vibe GT had the same braking set-up (4-wheel disc brakes coupled with 4-wheel ABS) I found the <b>braking</b> in the Matrix to be better. For reasons unknown to me, the Matrix XRS offered more of a smooth feel, a less spongy brake pedal, and what felt like quicker panic stops. This difference in braking performance was probably normal due to the Vibe having almost no miles on it, while the Matrix had a good 1,000 mile break in period. 
 
<b>Fuel economy</b> is average for a 4-cylinder powered vehicle. With an EPA of 22/29 the Matrix XRS offers fuel economy normally associated with V6 powered cars. I imagine Toyota could improve fuel economy here if they made the final gear (6th) taller. I also feel most owners will probably receive better fuel economy with conservative driving.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the Matrix XRS contains a 'titanium overload'. With most of the interior appliques being black, the titanium accents seem to stand out even further. Instead of being modest with this theme, Toyota has used these accents on almost every section of the front dash fascia giving the feeling you are sitting in front a big 1980s stereo system (even the 6-speed shifter knob is almost all titanium accented). The somewhat gimmicky 4-point Olympic ring styled gauges are all useful, however the constant (even when the head lamps are off) red lighting of these gauges can be a literal eye sore. Ergonomics are good, easy access is available from the drivers seat to the HVAC controls and all the gadgetry offered in the Matrix.

Some of my gripes with this interior, besides the overdose of simulated titanium, would be the cheap plastics used in the cabin. While nowhere near as flimsy or cheap as the plastics used in the Nissan Sentra/Altima, the interior does not seem to fit Toyota's high quality standards. When I usually open my car door upon exit, I often use my feet to do this task, I highly doubt the small flimsy map pockets in the Matrix could hold up to my abuse. 

Despite the negatives of the Matrix's interior there is just as many positives. The glove box is absolutely huge, there are 4 cup holders, tons of storage cubbies, a center console, and standard amenities are abundant. A rare feature found in the Matrix is a standard 115 volt power outlet which allows you to plug in items like a laptop. The front passenger seat folds down giving the driver a space specifically catering to laptops with directions posted on the rear seat back. Toyota also has integrated 2 12 volt power outlets for additional power. The standard single CD, 6-speaker AM/FM cassette sound system was average in quality, providing good bass, and clear tunes with excellent reception.  Toyota offers a 6-disc option at $100. The only interior options in my tester were a power sunroof at $750, and floor mats ($80). www.Toyota.com has a complete list of standard and optional equipment.

Seating is both supportive and comfy. The bolstering of front dark gray cloth bucket seats could be a little more pronounced for aggressive driving, although most people probably won't be doing too much aggressive driving due to the Matrix's handling limits. The rear seats are  60/40 split which can cater to 3 passengers. Like the front passenger seat, the rear seats fold down allowing for maximum stowage. Like the PT Cruiser, there are tie downs for objects and an amazing amounts of cargo room for a vehicle based on a small car's chassis. The Matrix also features a double hatch opening allowing for either the rear window to open up, or the full hatch to open. Head and leg room are also a strong attribute offered from the Matrix XRS. Being 5'6" I had a surplus of head and leg room in both the front and the rear. 

<b>Note:</b> A navigation system is available. ($1,750)

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

Looking like no other car on the road (besides maybe the Vibe), the Matrix XRS is definitely a love it or hate it design. I'm still at odds with this bulky looking sport wagon, although I have come to accept the styling of the Matrix much more so 'now' than when it was first introduced in the early part of 2002. I definitely like the visual designs of the Pontiac Vibe GT and PT Cruiser much better than the Matrix. The Vibe and PT Cruiser both seem to have a more stylish edge, giving them both a more handsome appearance. The Matrix XRS seems to be a little too futuristic/awkward looking, especially when optioned in silver ( as was the color of my tester). The overuse of honeycomb plastic is used on the front fascia which looks more 'cheap' than 'sporty.' Side skirts, 16" alloy rims, and small fog lamps are added giving this awkward wagon a somewhat lowered/ sporty appearance, however I'm not so sure this treatment is enough to make this wagon more attractive.  

<b>Note:</b> 17" rims are a $150 option, although with this option you can not have the power sunroof. 


<i>Price/Warranty:</i>

The Matrix XRS starts out at around $19,000, with the few options that came with my test car the price came to just a shade over $20,000. Despite my gripes with the Matrix, the low sticker price of my tester made for an excellent value. Toyota offers an adequate 3, year 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty and a 5 year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.


<i>Final notes:</i>

The Toyota Matrix XRS represents a fair value on the new car market. Even though the 1.8 VVTL-i engine is loud in most situations, the exterior visuals are a bit on the funky side, and the interior could do with a upgrade in materials and less titanium accents, the Matrix XRS is a competent wagon that offers decent bang for the buck. If you are looking to buy a new Subaru WRX, PT Cruiser, Mazda Protege 5, or any affordable wagon/utility vehicle, the Matrix XRS is definitely worth a test drive.
