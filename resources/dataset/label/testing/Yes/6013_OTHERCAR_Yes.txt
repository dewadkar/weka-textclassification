              I know I spent too much for my used Toyota Corolla 1992 model, but I don't even care.  I love it! I actually feel genuine affection for it. It has always been there for me, and has never let me down. 

  I live in northern Wisconsin and in 40 degrees below zero it always starts up on the first try. Gas mileage is 35 mpg consistently. The torc is unbelievable. I zoom off from a standstill at a red light and beat everyone next to me. I love doing that.  On steep uphill grades I can pass much larger and more powerful cars and trucks than mine. It's only a 4 cylinder automatic, but I can't believe the power it has. 

  It had 63,000 miles on it when I bought it 3 years ago. Now it has 139,000.  I do a lot of driving and a reliable car is important to me. I truly believe that it will last me well into the 300,000 mile range.

  It is a very comfortable car to drive. The seats are at a good level and it is easy to get in and out of. It has air conditioning that has never given me any trouble. It is an automatic - my first, and has been trouble-free. There is nothing I don't like about this car.

   I have the oil changed every 4000 miles, check the transmission fluid, and have had one tuneup in 3 years. I did need to replace the manifold because it cracked, but that was due to a design fault for that particular year - 1992. The later models did not have that fault. 

   I can guarantee that the next car I buy will be a Toyota, that is if I ever need to buy another car. How's that for a recommendation?<br><br>
