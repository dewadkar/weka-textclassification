            I own a 1998 Integra Type-R - generally acknowledged to be one of the best handling front-wheel drive cars on the market.  The Type-R is for the driving enthusiast.  If you want refinement, get a GS-R which is also excellent and has a sunroof. But for all-out handling performance and nice acceleration, the Type-R is what you want.  Every time I drive this car, I want to accelerate hard out of corners and wind it out on the straights.  It begs for you to drive it hard.  Because it is an Acura/Honda product, it will maintain its reliability which can't be said for some other makes.  

I love driving this car.  It brings a smile to your face every time you wind it out up to its 8,400 rpm redline(!!!).  It handles wonderfully, the engine begs to be revved and sounds great at high RPMs.  Other fellow enthusiast drivers often stare at the car because they know this is the 'real thing.'  Beware if you get one that many drivers of other sport compact cars will want to race you because the Type-R is the king of import sport coupes and they ALL want to see how their modified cars will do against the undisputed king.  The R with its huge rear wing gets lots of attention.  If you don't succumb (too often) to the thrill of racing, you'll manage to stay on the right side of the law.  I've autocrossed the car at local SCCA events and find that car performs wonderfully against the competition.  

The seats are great with high bolsters.  The ride is VERY STIFF so don't expect a cushy ride.  I've left my car stock, but many folks like to modify their Rs.  It's great as it is, trust me.  Don't expect to enjoy driving it on long trips because that's not what this car is meant for although I have done the Dallas-Atlanta 800 mile treks a few times and have enjoyed (nervously) taking the car to 130mph on a deserted straightaway.  The car is rock solid at high speed.  The 2000 models come in Yellow and Black and offer a new titanium shift knob, A/C standard, and some more carbon-fiber dash elements.  Other than that, my '98 is the same, but is in Championship White color.  Gas mileage is good too at around 24/28 mpg.  The car is limited to only 750 imported in year 2000 so you may have trouble finding one.  

The car mags generally have performance figures in this range:  0-60mph: 6.2-6.6 seconds; 1/4 mile 14.7-15.1 seconds; skidpad .88g-.92g.  These are great numbers for a $24,000 car. 

If you love to drive, you won't be disappointed.  You get 80% of the performance of an NSX at 1/4 the price. Not a bad deal! 

(I used to own a 1992 Integra GS-R which is also an excellent automobile with 160 hp and a good VTEC engine.  Handling is not as good as with the current generation Integras)<br><br>
