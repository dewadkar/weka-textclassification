            I bought my Cartier' b/c I needed more room for my family and extended family. It was a beautiful peralecent color and loaded to gills.
It had smooth power and handled pretty good (4 a Lincoln)
b/c of the tighter suspension and wider tires. Great ride and very comfy.

I traded it on an Explorer (mistake) b/c of little electronic gremlins.
The radio wasn't very good, and 2 speakers kept going out. Problms w/the cruise and seat heaters. Still, this  car was  great to get in after a hard day and turn the A/C up and just relax going home.

The T/C have always had a look of their own; the new body style is kind of ugly, yet the older style has a true timeless appeal. I wish my T/C had been more reliable or I'd still have it. I think mine was just a fluke-not a lemon-just a fluke. If one  goes to buy one, make sure all electrical parts are working, including seat heaters.<br><br>
