            I bought my VW Fox used since I needed something to get me back and forth to work, I have to commute 45 miles each way, many times in inclement weather. My Fox was the best thing for me cheap, easy to work on, and reliable. I quickly found out all of these were quite true. 
If I had to find one problem it would be this isn't a plush car it is practical so I wouldn't suggest 3 day road trips in it. however it gets me around. I must admit though I am big guy 6'1&quot; 215lbs. and I have more than enough leg and headroom, rare in a small car. 
Many people claim the car doesn't have any power, but if  you take good care of it it will go as fast as you will ever need it to. 

If you love it. It will go.<br><br>
