            alrighty laddies time for another story from your fav w7!!!!

ok here is a little game to play while driving on a long trip it has to do with saabs so i put it here. whenever anyone sees a saab they say saab and they get a point. if they are wrong they get -1 and if you see a saab dealership...its 100 pts. ok you got it? this game is really fun and you should try it out. anyways saabs are my fav cars and they are very nice and fun to drive around. you can get a good one for about 20k and i dont recomend the convertables. have fun kiddies
