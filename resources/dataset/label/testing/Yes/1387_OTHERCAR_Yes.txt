            Just came back from a Volvo organized test drive of the S 60 R. I spent approximately 3 minutes behind the wheel, so don't expect me to tell you how the car is to live with. If you want to know the MPG or how it handles in the parking lot, you're not going to get that from here. This is just a quick test drive around some corners on an abandoned airfield and I never got into 3'rd gear. 

Acceleration: Good and strong, but this is a highly tuned turbo charged car so don't but the sales pitch about how flat the torque curb is. You will have to keep the revs up to keep the boost coming. And once you get off the throttle, the engine will keep running for another tens of a second so before you get used to it, it is annoying.

Braking: Very very good. That's all you need to know.

Handling: Safe. Strong. Very capable and here's the thing. If you know how to drive and have some racing experience, this is NOT the car for you. You'dd be better off with something with less electronic "big brother" stuff controlling the car for you. But, if you are like most people in this country - you think you drive very well but have you ever really found out? Anyway, if you're like that then this car is very forgiving and will help you to get around a track, course, or through panic situations.

Final word: OK, 3 minutes behind the wheel. I like the shape of the S 60, it's a good looking car. Very subtle. I like the S 60R, even though personally I would have liked a little more "R-iness" in its looks (think M3 compared to 330 Ci). I just wish the engine would have been bigger and had less turbo-spooling since I prefer having the power right there as you hit the throttle. 

Would I buy this car? If I had $40K and wasn't in the market for an SUV (which I am) then yes. Without a doubt, yes. However, I probably would go for the V70R because how can you not like a stationwagon that drives like a racing car?
