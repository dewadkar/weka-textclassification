            A month ago, I finally received my long awaited Ford Mustang.  I got a white 2000 Mustang Convertible with black top.  Although, I did not get the GT which would have gave me a roaring V8 engine, my 3.8 liter, V6 is sufficient for now.

Being a teenager, I feel this car suits me perfectly.  Although its often too hot to put the top down during the day, I roam the nights with the wind in my face with this amazing convertible.  


<b>Customizing a Mustang</b>

One thing that I love about Mustangs is the ease of adding, modifying, and customizing them.  There are thousands of Mustangs on the road, and I definitely didn't want my Mustang to be just another one on the road.

<b>Rims</b>
The first thing I added to my Mustang were rims.  The stock wheels were 15&quot; grey ugly wheels on tires that can be called garbage.  I recently bought 17&quot; Cobra R Chrome rims that look absolutely stunning.  I chose 255/45/17 Bridgestone Potenza tires which are top of the line.  With my bigger wheels and wider tires, my car handles ten times better than with the previous ones.  Wow, do these rims make a difference.  My car stands out from all the rest of the Mustangs.

<b>Engine</b>
Upgrading your engine is also a good thing to do with Mustangs.  I really want my car to be faster.  The only thing I have done so far is add a K&amp;N Air Filter in my engine.  This adds about 8-10 horsepower, and for 40 bucks, that's not bad at all.  I plan to add a dual exhaust system which should add about 20-25 horsepower.  Superchargers are also available for the V6 and V8 Mustangs.

<b>Other things to add</b>
On Mustang convertibles, adding a light bar or roll bar can add a lot of flare to the look of your car.  Also, I plan on lowering the car with Eibach springs which improves the looks and handling.  


All in all, I love my car, and for a price in the low 20,000's, I feel I got a great car.  Not only does it look mean and cool, but it has some power under the hood.  It was a great buy.<br><br>
