            In reading some of the reviews written about the Quest, I feel as though a view from a sometimes lead-footed young parent should be voiced. My wife and I owned a 1996 Plymoth Voyager. We had spent several quality hours test driving different makes and models. The Ford Winstar was our first test drive and almost swayed us against minivans as a whole (enough said). The Oldsmobile drove like a full sized van, although the price was nice the ride wasn't. We eventually went with the Voyager. We were initially pleased, however when the warranty went out so did everything else. We disposed of our late ripening lemon and searched for a more dependable vehicle. After going through the whoopla of test driving again. The Nissan Quest and The Toyota Sienna were the two Vans that we favored. We chose the Nissan due to its 5 year 60,000 mile warranty. Both vans were fantastic on the road and came with a plethora of extras.<br><br>
