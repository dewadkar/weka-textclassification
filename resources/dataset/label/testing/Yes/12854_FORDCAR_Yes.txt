            I was an SUV owner back in the early days of SUV&#146s. While I lived in California, I had a couple of relatives who enjoyed going off road. One cousin had a 1986 Ford Ranger pickup, while the husband of another cousin had one of the original Jeep Cherokees (and &#14687 or &#14688, I think) with the 4.0-liter straight six.  Being a follower rather than a leader, I bought a brand new 1988 Isuzu Trooper. 120 horsepower from a 2.6-liter 4 cylinder against 4000 pounds &#150 you can imagine the results. However, what I appreciated about it was its ability to go almost anywhere, haul a lot of stuff and see over traffic in front of you. Kept the Trooper for almost 4 years, until the first Gulf War pushed gas prices to (gasp!) $1.50/gallon. Sold it and bought a Mazda Prot�g�.

Fast-forward a decade. A new job, a move to Colorado, a new wife and a couple of stepchildren later, I was in the market for an SUV again. In the winter of 1998, we leased a Ford Expedition &#150 at the time, the wife worked at a child-care center and was buying $500 worth of groceries at Sam&#146s Club. In addition, we drove the (old body style) Explorer and weren&#146t terribly impressed. A subsidized lease from Ford on the Expedition sealed the deal.

Two years later, the lease is up on the Expedition and we need a replacement. One of the best (and worst) features on the Expedition is the 3rd seat. Used it quite a bit (with two teenagers, they often wanted to bring their friends with them). However, removing and reinstalling the seat was a pain in the neck. Took two people, and you always had to find a spot to store it.  The redesigned Explorer had just been introduced, and the thought of a 3rd row that folded into the floor appealed to us. Soon afterwards, a dark green Explorer XLT (optioned with leather, a 6-CD in dash changer, the aforementioned 3rd row and rear A/C) was parked in our garage.

We&#146ve had our Explorer for 2 � years and about 35,000 miles. This has been our 3rd lease from Ford (before the Expedition, we leased an Escort for the wife). Unfortunately, the third time has not been a charm. Lots of niggling issues have kept us from forming a lasting attachment to the vehicle.

First, however, are the positives. The Explorer felt more the right size than the Expedition &#150 we always felt like we were piloting a small ship herding that thing around. The Explorer, with the new independent rear suspension, rode a lot better and never felt as &#147tippy&#148 in the corners. Granted, nobody will mistake it for a Porsche, but I imagine that in the world of mid-sized SUV&#146s, the Explorer can hold its own. The 3rd row was large enough for our daughter to ride comfortably in &#150 in fact, we took it to Las Vegas and back (1500 miles) and she rode in the 3rd row (albeit with one of the second row seats folded down) and didn&#146t complain at all.

Seat comfort is above average - the trip to Vegas was done with no obvious fatigue after 6 or 7 hours behind the wheel. The dashboard layout is clean and simple - gauges for all major engine components frame the speedometer and tachometer, while the stereo and A/C controls are logical and easy to understand. The only minor complaint I could lodge is that there are many blank switches, which reminds you that you didn't pop for the Eddie Bauer or Limited trim levels.

The engine was powerful enough for the mountain passes of Colorado, and returned what I feel is decent mileage (17mpg overall, with some tanks approaching 20mpg). I never felt like I was working the engine hard, even in passing situations.

The driving position is good with the power seats and tilt steering, and the wife positively loved the in-dash CD changer. She has sworn never to go back to a trunk-mounted changer. Second row legroom was more than adequate, and the 40-40-20 seats are versatile. Visibility is quite good, and an option that we initially didn&#146t know too much about has turned out to be really useful &#150 the rear parking sensors. Very nice when backing up to a loading dock to get furniture or into the garage with a load of groceries.

The 4WD system is easy to operate, as it is done via push buttons near the center stack. Normal mode is 4x4 Auto, which puts power to the front wheels when the rear wheels slip. There are also buttons for 4x4 Hi and 4x4 Lo. Did not get much of a chance to use these buttons, but we did have our big Colorado blizzard last March (30+ inches of snow in 48 hours) and the Explorer got around OK - it might have been better with snow tires, but I didn't get stuck.

The negatives, however, seem to equal the positives. There haven&#146t been too many mechanical issues (rear A/C gasket failed, rear window shattered due to design flaw), but they&#146ve always been aggravating to get resolved. I suppose this is more a reflection on the dealer (same dealer, by the way, for all three Ford leases) than it is on the vehicle.

The transmission has been a bit of a weak spot. It seems to &#147hunt&#148 more than I&#146d like, and it doesn&#146t shift smoothly 100% of the time. I&#146ve asked the dealer about it, and they didn&#146t really want to do much.

Another gripe has been about the 3rd row seat. When folded, it does not provide a truly flat floor, and there is a sliding panel that is meant to cover the gap between the 2nd and 3rd rows. That panel seems to want to slide backward, creating a hole for stuff to fall into. This is more annoying than anything else.

We&#146ve also had trouble with our keys sticking in the ignition. When we want to remove the key, it doesn&#146t want to turn to the position where it can be removed. Usually, moving the tilt wheel up and down will solve the problem; other times, the car has to be restarted and shut off to free the key up. It seems to happen most frequently when we&#146re in a hurry, which causes much cursing and swearing.

This will probably be our last Ford. The dealership experience with the Explorer, right from the very beginning, has sealed the deal for us. While we will probably get another SUV when the Explorer lease is up next spring, it is unlikely to be another Ford product.
