            I'm a first time Saturn owner and I'm hooked. I recently purchased a 1996 Saturn SL1 four door, five speed, with air, cd player and tinted windows. With 127,000 km, it was a real bargain at $7500 Canadian. That's about $5100 American. The car handles beautifully, accelerates well, gets great gas mileage, and has lots of room for a family of four. The styling both inside and out is clean and sharp. The only one improvement that I could hope for, is a little quieter cabin. Sometimes on the highway it's a little loud. It's a great car and I can't wait for the first picnic!  <br><br>
