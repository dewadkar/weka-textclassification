            We live in a cabin on a mountain a long way from a paved road or even a gravel road...we can't pay enough to keep up the road, so without four wheel drive we don't get anywhere. We bought the Durango to survive with at least a little of the comfort we were used to having when we lived in a metropolitan area. The interior room isn't just hype...we meet visitors at the bottom of the mountain, store the big gear on the carrier on top and take the rest of it inside and take them up the mountain...four guests with a weeks worth of stuff and no one is crowded. After you start our &quot;Mango&quot; Durango it is put into 4 wheel drive...it runs in 4 wheel more than not...seven days a week and several trips a day. The power gives you control on the gutted and washed out road. Over rocky ridges like sidewalk curbs, the traction is good and it seems like a cat walking securely over the terrain. Even though its rough you can look over the side and see straight down a thousand feet and feel safe in a strong machine made to withstand rugged constant use. The big tires give you clearance...more than any other SUV. The horsepower to weight ratio, the frame of a truck and the solidly performing 4 wheel drive makes me mobile in snow and ice when many other 4 wheel drive machines cannot make it.
The fog lights aren't just show...on a dark mountain road they're a safety feature that works. Dirt, mud, rocks...it performs...I love it.<br><br>
