            It's taken me a while to get into the digital camera fad, but I'd advise anyone to start using these things. Just imagine: no film, no fuss! 
And there's few better cameras than the Sony DSC-S50.

A big advantage of this camera over other models is the inclusion of a 'Memory Stick'. Strangely enough, it looks nothing like a stick, but allows you to store up to 64Mb in a very compact space. Also you can use it to store, record, and transfer images and data between PC's and other Memory Stick products. It's really a lot of fun. Shoot, store, and show.

The camera itself is also very impressive. With a resolution of 2.1 Megapixels, it's sharp enough for almost anything. Pictures are crisp: just what you would expect. The zoom function is a bit of a let down, however, just 3x zoom (with 6x Precision zoom).  Perhaps a disappointment, considering that other cameras can offer at least 10x zoom.

But however, there's a stack of other features. There's an MPEG movie function, which allows you to play movies - handy. And don't forget the other features such as anti-red eye reducition, file copy, and 3:2 mode, and a USB connection.

The battery life is great: you can take up to 2500 shots on one battery charge; and believe me, one battery charge will last you ages.

The Sony is pretty pricey, but I've got a habit of buying expensive things. In my opinion it's well worth it.<br><br>
