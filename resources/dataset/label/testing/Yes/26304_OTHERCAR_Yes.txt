            After years of the Civic Si absence it has finally returned to the US. I just purchased the 2000 Honda Civic Si mainly because of it's powerhouse engine, tweaked suspension, fully loaded (more than the EX model) and simply because as an import enthusiast it's a must have before they're all gone. I love the fact that Honda brought back the Si to the states, too bad it isn't the Civic Type R. It's 160HP DOHC V-Tech engine just simply put makes this car quick and very responsive. With it being a limited edition type car it comes FULLY loaded, I mean loaded. Power windows and doors, keyless entry, moon roof, power mirrors, alloy wheels, CD player and 6 speaker system and much more. Suspension being tweaked with a front and rear strut bar, makes you hug the corners very nicely. Three colors available black, red, and a new color electron blue. There is however one down side to this import beauty, the front seats. They are not very comfortable and seem small, very poor support for your upper and lower back, neck seems to be only thing of comfort. MSRP at $17995 its affordable, reliable, and just exciting to have one. I recommend buying this car to anyone and everyone (that is if you can find any left at your nearest Honda dealer) that likes great price a powerhouse engine and for those who like to own those special edition cars that aren't here for long, and for people like myself who like to add after market equipment to make your ride great looking and a little faster and what better vehicle than the Civic Si, being the highest and most fun to work on after market. And also having the biggest and most extensive parts available to make it special.<br><br>
