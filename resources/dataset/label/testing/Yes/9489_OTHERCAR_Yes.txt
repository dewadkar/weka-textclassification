                Ahh, the Ram. One of the most distinctive vehicles on the road. A big, bad truck defintely sporting attitude.
   

    This truck was bought, well, basically because it looks so good. And a replacement for our aging common sedan was imminent. This particular model is a '97 Driftwood (Silver) Extended cab 2wd model set up to do some hauling, heavy duty everything. And haul it does, albeit at the expense of ride. Frankly, it rides like a buckboard on anything but the smoothest of surfaces. It won't shake your fillings out, but you can defintely feel the road. However it IS a truck, and its got a job to do. If you're looking for a nice, smooth ride, look to a Seville.
  

   Some things I love about this vehicle are it's 'get-outta-my-way' attitude. The semi-esque front fascia and large chrome grille look the truck part and really make the vehicle. Also, I've noticed not as many people are as inclined to pull out in front of me while driving it. A definite plus. The interior is large and roomy, and the big, wide bucket seats are made with quality fabric and are pretty comfy in my opinion. It's got a real back seat that can hold 3 adults in relative comfort (I recommend shorter distances in that set-up though) and there are plenty of neat little pockets and cup holders and little nooks. I really like the fold down arm rest that also serves a ton of other storage capabilities, coins, cassettes, and one big bin for whatever. Pretty nifty. The stereo is an AM/FM cassette and for factory, isn't half bad; I've heard worse. In terms of driving, it's surprisingly maneuverable, considering the size. It's not that huge, but you're a big part of steel on the road, especially to the Corolla in front of you. The steering is good, and the 4-speed transmission is a smooth shifter. However, I've heard some bad things about potential problems with the transmissions in these years once it gets past about 50k miles or so. I would make sure to get the transmission checked out by a reputable mechanic if you're buying a Ram older than 2 years.
  

   Another thing I really love about this truck, the 5.2-liter V8 in this truck is a gem, and has tons of low-end torque, which is good news for those of you wanting to pull stumps. It also excels in merging unto a fast highway, and keeping up the pace. Fuel mileage is not exactly stellar, though. Be prepared for frequent and high fill-ups.
   

   A good truck with nice fit-and-finish, a great engine, and the looks to fit the part. If you want the original Mack truck (on a slightly smaller scale) this is it.<br><br>
