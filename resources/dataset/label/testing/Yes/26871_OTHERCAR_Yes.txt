            for three weeks as a rental car while my truck was in the shop.

Overall, I'd say that driving the car was a great experience. It had nice acceleration and a smooth ride: 80 MPH felt no different than 40 MPH.

There were a couple of things that I noticed about the Sable, however, that are worth mentioning.

One is that, even when at a full stop, the car tends to feel as if it's "hopping" forward a little, almost as if someone from behind just tapped your bumper. I adjusted to this but found it to be annoying.

The second is that there is little to no head room and the ceiling slopes dramatically, making it a bad choice for either very tall or very short people. Very tall, obviously, because the ceiling is, as I previously mentioned, too low. Very short (I am 5'2") because, when I pulled the seat forward to better reach the pedals, the visor was directly above my head. I personally don't like to make head contact with the car when I'm driving; it makes me feel boxed in.

However, I enjoyed the Sable very much overall. There was plenty of space for friends, the trunk was pretty roomy, the aesthetics within the car were nice, the A/C and the heater were both exceptionally powerful.
