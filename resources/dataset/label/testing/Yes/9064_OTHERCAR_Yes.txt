            I found my 1993 BMW 325i on a used car lot. It had 60,000 miles and was in good condition. It is quick, efficient, easy to drive and great on long distance interstate driving. It has a leather interior, power windows, seats, sun roof, a great sound system and gets about 27 miles to the gallon. Currently it has 97000 miles and I am hoping to drive it to 150000 miles or more. 
The car is not built for long distance comfort.  The ride is some what rough with the back seat passengers taking the hardest bumps. The leather interior is attractive and has help up well.  The 325i skimps on leg and head room, tall passengers are cramped and uncomfortable. 
I enjoy driving this car, but I would not recommend it for family use. 
I am considering trading it for a more comfortable car that has a much easier ride and plenty of leg room. 
One of the amenities that BMW lacks is a cup holder.  I really miss them.
On the whole, I like my BMW and am glad I've had the experience of driving and owning one.
