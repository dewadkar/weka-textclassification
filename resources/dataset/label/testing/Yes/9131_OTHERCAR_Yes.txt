            Recently I had the chance to test drive a brand new lincoln navigator.  To me, it was one of the best rides that I have driven.  It is such a smooth ride as well as a great looking car.  It is powerful, has great turning ability, comfortable, roomy, and has a great sound system on the inside for listening to some tunes while you drive.  I am partial to the ford explorer myself but dont miss out on the lincoln navigator. It serves as a great family car and is even handy off road.  I would suggest this car to anyone who is looking to buy a new Suv.  At least give it a test drive and you will be convinced, just like me.   bbeck01<br><br>
