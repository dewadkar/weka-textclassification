            If you are in the market for a great sports car and still have the ability to drive the thing everyday, the Honda civic is for you.  The new (1999) civic si is the car you should look at.  Unless you are going to spend a ton of cash.

For the people interested in a performer the si makes 160hp with a 1.6 liter v-tech.  with that power it takes 706 seconds to get to 60mph, that is not bad for a car that weighs around 2500lbs.  also it comes with and rear stabilizer bars, they help the car stay level and not lean so much.  It also comes with 4 wheel independant suspension to keep the wheels on the ground better.  The only thing that this car could use if you are traveling at a high rate of speed is variable power steering. This car does not have the option of ABS if that is concern to a buyer.

With a base price of 17500 it is a whole lot of speed.  Then you can upgrade when you get the money.  With a ground effects kit they can be the nicest looking car around.

The things that i love about this vehicle is that it is cheap, fast, reliable, and looks good.  There is not a whole lot of bad that can be said except the power steering isnt variable and that it is a 5 speed and it could use a sixth gear for speed.
