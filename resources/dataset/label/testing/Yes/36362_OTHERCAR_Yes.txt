            Honda Accord 1994 is one of my favorite car for everyday use. It is stable, reliable and maintenance free. The 4 door sedan has enough room for 5 adults to ride in, plenty of trunk space and good gas consumption. My friends and I go everywhere in the Accord. Long distance interstate trips and those midnight 7-Eleven runs are all handled with ease. Automatic transmission makes this car easy for everyone from senior citizens to new drivers. power steering makes turning and parking a breeze. The only thing I have to complain about is the weak engine. For its size, the 4 cylinder hardly does it justice. It is also very plain in terms of design, so its not made for car enthusiasts. My conclusion, this car is good for everyone except maybe the power drivers.<br><br>
