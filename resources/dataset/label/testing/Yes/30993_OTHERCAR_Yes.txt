            I bought my '94 Supra Twin Turbo in summer of '99 with 54k on the clock. And I have to say that I am still amazed by this car. When the Supra came out in '93, I fell instantly in love with it after reading all the reviews and comparison test of it. However, I was only 16 at the time, and it's fair to say, spending over $40k on a car was simply not an option!!! So the thoughts of owning one got shelved with all the other dream cars. In the following years, I owned a wide range of cars, from a beater '77 Mercury Monarch and '80 Ford F100, to a '95 Mustang Cobra, '96 Ram Air Trans Am WS6 and a '91 Sentra SE-R. During this time I researched just about every car in existance as a hobby, and collected over 500 car magazines in the process! So when I had the money to get REAL car, I knew exactly what I wanted, a forth generation Supra Twin Turbo.

When stock, the Supra has great performance. Published test results show the Supra running 0-60 in 5.3 to 5.5 seconds. It runs the Quarter-Mile in 13.4 to 13.6 seconds at 105 to 107 mph. The top speed is electronically limited to 155mph, but pulling the "TRAC" fuse dissables this. Handling is just as impressive with skidpad numbers ranging from .94g to .98g, braking checks in at 109-116ft from 60-0.

As impressive as these numbers may be, I had no intention of leaving the Supra stock. The Supra really seems to have been designed to be modified. The power is artificially limited by an extremely restrictive exhaust system, and a low boost output. By "correcting" these two problems with a complete exhaust system upgrade including downpipe, installing a boost-controller, and a boost cut eliminator, the Supra can make over 400hp. With these mods my Supra put out 405hp AT THE WHEELS, which is around 471hp at the engine, however this was with some high octane unleaded race gas. It also ran the quarter-mile in 12.4 seconds at 119 mph on regular street tires. 0-60 has been timed at 4.2 seconds on a G-Tech/Pro.

The engine modifications also gives the engine some edginess which it lacked stock. The stock engine builds boost so smoothly and progressively, it actually feels kinda sluggish at times. With mods though, that changes completely, boost comes on like a kick in the pants and presses you deep into the seats, and the straight 6 engine sounds great, not like the uneveness of a V6.

And if simple bolt-ons and 400hp won't do, the Supra with the right Turbo upgrade can make about as much power as you want (or can afford). Most "street" turbos that have minimal lag can make well over 600hp, and if you run race gas and a mondo turbo, Supras have been known to make over 800hp at the wheels before requiring internal upgrades like pistons and rods. The driveline is equally impressive with the 6-speed Getrag and rear differential and axles capable of 9 second quarter-mile timeslips. Some complain that the driveline and clutch can seem noisy or clunky, but that is just the trade off from having basically a race car driveline in a street car. I don't mind it though, it reminds me just how serious this car is. And if you drive the car smoothly, you never hear a peep out of it.

However, there is more to the Supra than power. They make very competent road racers, and I have found that they also make good autocrossers. I commonly run slightly quicker times than the much lighter RX7 Twin Turbos at local events. And A Supra has placed 4th place in the 2001 and 2002 Car and Driver "Cannonball" One Lap of America. Not to mention the Supra placed 4th in Car and Driver's Best Handling Car Competition back in '97, beating the Porsche 993 and Boxster, as well as the C5 Vette and Viper GTS. Much of the credit has to go to the 4 wheel forged aluminum double wishbone suspension and the rigid chassis (as long as the targa top is in place), as well as great aerodynamics that provide great stability at high speeds (that rear wing is not just for looks).

In spite of this great performance, the Supra is still a very good daily commuter and long distance tourer. The suspension is firm, but never harsh, and feels very smooth on the highway. The interior is also very quiet, with very little in the way of wind noise, squeeks or rattles. What noise there is seems to generate from the high performance tires.

With me being 6-4, I was concerned with interior room, but the Supra seems to have an abundance of it, I don't even put the seat all the way back! The dash also seems to wrap around the driver with all the guages and controls in easy reach and view, with the tachometer sitting where it should, directly in front of the driver, with the 180mph speedometer off to the right side. The drivers seat definately feels like your sitting in a cockpit. However, consider the rear seat to be for storage only, somebody can sit back there in a pinch, but they won't like it.

The exterior styling is very love-it-or-hate-it. It was designed around aerodynamic principals. However, with a nice (tasteful) set of 18" wheels and a slight lowering of ride height with performance springs, the Supra really looks amazing, and I always seem to get stares and compliments wherever I go. And unlike other cars I've owned, the Supra doesn't really get many "negative comments" from people who could be refered to as "haters", it's usually all positive. It has the ability to draw a small crowd whenever there are other car guys around, so you have to be willing to chat with people about the car. And for people that want to have a nice car to attract "chicks", aside from the fact that it can help give a favorable first impression, it attracts the attention of WAY more guys than girls. 

If your getting a car, get if for yourself, to make YOU  happy. And trust me, with the Targa Top off, this car just begs for a cruise down the strip at the beach, and with the sun shinning down on you, it doesn't get much better. And as I said earlier, removing the Targa does create more shaking and rattles, but that seems not nearly so obvious with the front and rear shock tower bars added, even with the stiffer springs and shocks.

With the 6-speed transmission, the Supra's EPA mileage is 17/23mpg, but it's hard to get that with the happy pedal always begging to be stomped! And the Supra's reliability has been rated as being the highest amoung sports cars by JD Power, but most models out on the market are 7-9 years old, so do plan on a few repairs, and while most repairs are no more expensive than most imports ("modern" cars for that matter), some repairs, like turbo's and transmission repairs can be pricey, and tires are only good for about 10,000 miles, and are not cheap, so keep that in mind.

The insurance is not cheap on this car. If you have a clean record, it is very affordable, $70-$80 a month. But if you have points on your record, it can climb into the hundreds. And be prepared to excersize considerable restraint. This car with just a couple mods, will accelerate to over 100mph in the same time it take for most cars to just hit a 55mph speed limit. And even at those speeds it's still pulling hard, and will keep doing so untill well past 170mph. That can get you into trouble (or dead) VERY quickly. This can take a little bit of fun out of having all that power, you can only enjoy it for a few short seconds at a time. Parents, DO NOT BUT THIS CAR FOR YOUR TEENAGER!!!

I have now had my Supra for 3 years, and it has 71,000 miles on it, the car now mostly is a weekend toy and auto-x car, now that I have another car to use as a daily driver. It's also great to have after a bad day, when you get home, pull the top off, and go for a drive though some back roads, it's like prozac!

I can say though, is this car is awesome, and while it's not for everyone, I love it, and I have no plans of ever getting rid of it.
