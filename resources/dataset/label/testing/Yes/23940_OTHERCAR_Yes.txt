            Although the air conditioner has a tendency to fail after about 40,000 miles, this car is very solid and sporty.  It is priced just about right for its luxury and performance.  Althought pick-up is not breathtakingly fast, it has enough power to put a smile onto your face.  That combined with its cornering ability and solid mechanics make for a good car. This car does not spend much time in the shop and will run for as long as you ask. The hardtop puts a barrier between you and the sounds outside the car when you want the top up.  Anyone who likes a fun convertible sports car and wants to look good should go test drive this car.<br><br>
