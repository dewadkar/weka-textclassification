            I purchased the Dodge Durango after 1 year of doing comparisons amongst SUV's from other manufacturers, and found that the Durango excelled in many areas, but paled in only a few.  Amongst it's pluses are MASSIVE passenger and driver room (I'm 6'3&quot; and 280lbs, and I have room to spare), comfortable seating for 8 or a lot of useful cargo space, great feel on the road and great driver visibility.  I've also found a great deal of pleasure in the Infinity speaker package, which is WELL worth the money if you're an audiophile who's not handy with car electronics, or just looking for a great sounding stereo.  It's taller and longer than the Explorer and the Jimmy/Blazer, and has more power than I know what to do with.  

Amongst the few minuses are relatively poor gas mileage, when compared with the sticker.  This is a result of the 3.92 axle ratios that come with the towing package, as compared to the standard 3.55.  My vehicle is equipped with the 5.2L V8, and I usually obtain 9-10MPG on the average, with mostly city driving.  That city is Pittsburgh, which is hilly, though, so you may expect more if you live in a flatter area.  The other minuses are poor side visibility with the 6&quot;x9&quot; side mirrors, and excessive fan noise (in the '99 model, which I've heard was corrected for 2000 models).  

Overall, my heart and mind both conclude that the Dodge Durango is an awesome vehicle when considering everything from looks to handling, power to capability.  It's the best thing Dodge has ever made.<br><br>
