            Are you looking for a digital camera that offers outstanding image quality at any speed but don�t want to shell out the big bucks? If you are, then perhaps the HP Photosmart 618 digital camera is the camera for you. Priced moderately for beginner or novice photographers, the 618 offers some very unique features that other digital cameras in its price range lack.

Hewlett Packard is quickly becoming a force in digital camera production. I have found from past experience to present that their products are exceptional and the HP Photosmart 618 is no exception to the rule. I have found it to be a fabulous camera that is easy to use, produces fantastic images and even offers an option to record sounds associated with your photo that you can playback.

The HP Photosmart 618 automatically adjusts its aperture to compensate for difficult lighting capturing images that are sharp with little or no color dissipation passed onto print. The 618 features a Pentax power zoom that is equivalent to the best 35mm lens allowing for up close and personal close-ups as well as great panoramas or wide shots. Powered by four AA batteries or an AC adapter when convenient, the HP Photosmart 618 can take pictures for quite some time without having to change batteries which is an additional benefit to those on the go.

One of the nicest features of the HP Photosmart 618 is one that is not often found on cameras today but is a truly important one. The 618 features a ten second time delay allowing plenty of time to set up a shot from a tri-pod and make your way into the photograph. I especially love this feature!

The HP Photosmart 618 uses a 16 MB removable card that HP calls �Compact Flash� that depending upon resolution holds quite a few pictures. One Compact Flash card will hold up to 160+ photos at 800x600 dpi but that number will drop significantly lower using higher definitions. Long battery life will allow you to use several cards to capacity before you change them.

I have found using the HP Photosmart 618 to be a very nice experience whether I am taking pictures or downloading them to computer for my print needs. I highly recommend the HP Photosmart 618 as a great digital camera that the entire family can use to produce great memories.

Fast, Fun, And Easy To Use! What Else Could You Ask For?
