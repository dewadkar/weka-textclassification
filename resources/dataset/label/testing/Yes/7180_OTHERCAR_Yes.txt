            Pros: reliable, great paint, all around nice 
Cons: 
Recommended: Yes 

My father bought our 2WD SR5 4runner in 1991 as a program car. It's dark blue with blue cloth interior, and an automatic transmission. We have used it for every thing from camping, to hauling rocks. It get's decent gas mileage, although it's really underpowered, it will get up to speed fast enough for me. The only real problems that we have had in it was that the head gasket blew, (although Toyota refunded us for it) and the little black plastic caps kept falling off when you hit big bumps(silicon glue fixed that), and that about 7 people have rear ended my father, with minor damage to him, and major damage to a dodge neon thanks to the trailer hitch. The paint has held up remarkably well, and so has the interior. I don't like the feel of the gas pedal as much as our Avalon, but you get used to it. We are about to replace all the audio components in the car because after 10 years, they don't sound as great as they used to. Over all, if you can live with an engine you have to coax along, this is otherwise an excellent car.
