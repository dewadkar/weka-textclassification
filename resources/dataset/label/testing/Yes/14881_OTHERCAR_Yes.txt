            My husband bought me this camera about a year and a half ago as a birthday present...best one yet I'd say !

At first I knew nothing about digital cameras and was *almost* wondering when this might come in handy.  I got over that quick. HaHa.

I have had NO problems at all using it even from day one.  The instructions are very clear and accurate. I didn't find them confusing even to a novice.
About my favorite feature is that it uses a standard floppy disk to &quot;store&quot; your pictures on, instead of having memory in the camera itself then having to transfer to your computer. When I know there might be a photo opportunity somewhere I just grab a handful of diskettes and off I go.
I find the battery also holds a charge well, and charges quickly when recharging is necessary.

My one and only complaint if you could even call it that is this.
On the back of the camera is an LCD screen that acts as your viewfinder.
That is all fine and dandy unless it's daylight then you can't see worth a darn what you might be shooting.
I haven't really checked, and they may make something to help that I can't say, but that is the only drawback from my standpoint.

It's also a good size, not bulky at all, and fits well in your hand. Overall, I'd say &quot;Go for the Sony&quot;<br><br>
