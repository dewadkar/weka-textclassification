            This is a remarkable vehicle.  It is extremely stable and corners like a dream.  The acceleration is super, and the braking is equally good - it's incredibly responsive.  The car is expensive, but the all-wheel drive makes it worthwhile (that is, one would be concerned about controlling a car with this much torque on snowy streets, but it isn't hard to handle at all).  

The finish is excellent and the engineers and people who actually fabricated the car clearly paid a lot of attention to details.  For example, the little sunshade above the rear view mirror, the passenger side rear view mirror that tilts when you shift into reverse, the little device to hold grocery bags upright in the trunk (admittedly, going grocery shopping in this car is like cracking a peanut with a sledgehammer); two storage spaces between the front seats; a heating system that doesn't start blowing air until the engine is warm enough to heat the air.

The car is comfortable and a pleasure to drive.  The seats are good and there is adequate headroom - more than in the BMW 740 I traded in.  The lumbar support feature on the seats is very nice and there is plenty of room.  Once you learn what all the controls do, they are straightforward to use.  The steering wheel has a good feel to it - like a sports car, very tight.  

The 740 was traded in because I wanted a car that was more exciting to drive.  Excitement one gets - around town I have learned to drive as if there is an eggshell I have to preserve between my foot and the gas pedal. One can exceed city speed limits in 2 seconds of acceleration.  The transmission system works beautifully, but it is barely feasible to shift manually when starting out full bore: you reach 7000 rpm so quickly in 1st gear there is no time to think about shifting - you have to do it by Zen.

The car has a great Bose stereo system and a really nice integrated phone/On Star system.  My only criticism is that the turn signal stalk, which contains the controls for the cruise control, is a little too close to the steering wheel, making it awkward to turn the CC on or off.

As one would expect with a car having 450 HP, the gas mileage isn't great, but on the road I have clocked 22 MPG at a steady 70 MPH.  The car also goes through windshield washer fluid a a high rate now that winter has come.

An interesting aspect to the car is that it is something of a wolf in sheep's clothing.  People who know about cars, but not the RS6 specifically, suspect something is out of the ordinary when they spot the wheel wells, the low profile tires and the size of the brakes on the front wheels.  Questions are sometimes asked, especially if the engine is running and that wonderful V-8 noise is coming out of the exhaust.  On the other had, those who think it's just another 4-door sedan are amazed when they see the 60 - 100 mph passing performance.
