            When we decided to buy a new truck, I had complete faith in my husband regarding which make we would purchase.  He is a auto body technician and works with vehicles every day.  He has watched the metal change to plastic and the quality decrease in some makes.

When he said he would like a Chevy, it was not his first choice.  In his opinion, Toyota trucks are by far a better quality truck.  To admit this irks him as he is very patriotic by nature.  However, the cost of the Toyota is out of our league so we have taken his second choice.

The Chevrolet Silverado 1500, regular cab pick-up is not so regular anymore.  The one we purchased has a V6 Vortex motor and will not need to be serviced until it hits 100,000 miles.  The truck lets you know when the oil needs changing by the odometer reading.  A little red light will come on telling you to change the oil.  Although, we opted for nothing fancy, just A/C and automatic transmission, the interior of the truck is quite becoming.  The sound system is great.  The bench seat has captain backs and an armrest and there is a middle compartment in the dash with cup-holders and a tray. The spare tire is locked in to prevent theft.

I love pick-ups and I think that they are easier to drive than cars much to my husband's dismay.  He can't keep me away from it.  It's sleek 2000 design and beige metallic color really make it stand out.

At $17,500 sticker, we managed to bring the price down even more and got a good deal at $15,000. My man may like Toyotas but right now he is a happy Chevy man.    <br><br>
