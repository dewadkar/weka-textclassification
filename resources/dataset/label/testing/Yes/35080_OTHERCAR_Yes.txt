            We bought this Van November 29 of 1993 because our little pickup truck was getting very packed with a car seat between us. Got a fairly good deal considering we bought this in California and bought the basic package. Only one sliding door (that was the only available option at that time), air bags, ac am/fm radio, anti lock breaks. This van has 99 thousand miles on it has been from cali to illinois to many times to count and now that we have 3 kids and we go on trips all the time we are happy we made this purchase. The only maintenance we have had to make to this van in the 6 yrs we have had it is the routine oil and tires and one a/c re-charge. The chairs are somewhat a pain to move around but the over all space is perfect even with 2 car seats and an 8 yr old. *S* I love this van and will buy another one when the time comes. Test drive it for your self and see if it's the van for you.<br><br>
