            The Tracker ZR2 Wagon is a popular compact SUV from Chevrolet. With a boxy design, the Tracker is more cute than rugged. With four doors and a V-6 engine, this Tracker is easy to maneuver and it's size is an advantage when it comes to parking. Chevy's Tracker is an economical option for those looking for a solid SUV, based at a little over $20,000.

The Tracker's ride is firm and a bit on the bumpy side when road conditions differ. However, all compact SUV's suffer from the same characteristic, so don't be misled that the Tracker handles better than most small SUV's. The Tracker is available in either two or four-wheel drive. The V-6 engine provides 155 horsepower, which is driven by an automatic transmission, standard equipped. You can travel about 20 miles per gallon on the highway and about 18 miles per gallon in the city.

When you are looking around for an SUV, take the Tracker ZR2 Wagon for a test drive. It's compact frame is it's real value. The Tracker has good size and is easy to park in tight places. The downside is because it's a smaller SUV, you can expect a smaller, less powerful engine. 

My wife and I are currently in the market for an SUV. We are seriously considering the Tracker. When we test drove the Tracker, we drove into high traffic areas, and we were comfortable with its size and maneuverability in those busy areas.
