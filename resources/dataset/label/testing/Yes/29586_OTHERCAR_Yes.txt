            My Wife and I bought this Mini-van because of my two-year old son.  Before we had a Nissan GXE car and on overnight trips we would pack the car for a one night stay 100 miles away. Talk about stuffing a car! That trip told us that we needed to get a van and get one in a hurry!  We bought the top of the line Quest GLE fully loaded and we love it!  The double sliding doors make for easy access for getting my son in and out and the video player really keeps him entertained as we go. The space in the back to load our luggage is just what we needed and because the back seat slides up, we still have plenty of room left over to relax and enjoy our long trips. My wife goes to sleep on me now when she never would before because she has the room to spread out now in the her captain's seat.  The 6 disk cd changer and memory/power seats are right on time for us. When I'm siting in the back, I like the fact that I can put on my headphones and listen to what I want different from everyone else and not bother them while they listen and watch what they want. Driving this mini-van feels as if we are still drive our car, it's very roomy and easy to handle. I highly recommend this van to parents of small children.  You'll really Thank GOD that you did!<br><br>
