            About me and cars:
I don't get emotionally attached to cars, I am not a car guru (I am a TRAVEL GURU! - so look at my travel reviews!, oops)... Therefore I will try to tell you in plain English an unbiased review of my car - chosen based upon:
Reliability, Price, Looks and my previous good luck with Nissan cars...

The history of my Altima (the Nissan Altima is known as the Nissan Primera in the UK!)
Okay - I bought my Nissan Altima in June of 1998
I chose the standard GXE model, stick shift (manual transmission) with nothing fancy added. I drive as part of my job - therefore my car makes several short journeys every working day, I have clocked over 26,000 miles in just over one year. I take the car in for service (almost) on time.

The Altima GXE:

GOOD POINTS:
the engine (runs perfectly and smoothly, started every time)
the CD player (which comes standard!)
the exterior paintwork (never seems to get chipped/scratched)
acceleration/driving experience (has just enough power)
brakes (thankfully - seem fine)
the ride (smooth and generally uneventful)

BAD POINTS:
driving seat legroom (seems a bit cramped - for my long legs)
internal height/space in the car (headroom is a bit tight - I actually sometimes feel a bit too close to the sun-visor)
trunk space (the 'hinges' in the trunk intrude down into the trunk-space when you close the trunk)
air conditioning (I need more cool air please!)
slightly boring (nobody gets out of a Nissan Altima with their pulse racing and beads of sweat on their forehead - unless they just missed killing the neighbors cat)
the dashboard controls for the air/ventilation and car stereo seem slightly 'cheap'

One other minor annoyance - the rear seats do fold flat, allowing expansion for the trunk space. However the diameter of the opening between the trunk and the folded rear seats is too small!

OVERALL &amp; THE INTANGIBLES:
For the price - I am very satisfied with this car. The fact that it has never broken down, nor had ANY problems with the engine is a major bonus for me. The car is for small families, price / safety conscious people, the type of driver who doesn't want to worry about spark plugs/engine size etc.

And in the words of Nissan.... my car certainly has been 'DRIVEN'
