                I recently started shopping for a car.  I really did not know what I wanted.  I decided I wanted a convertible or a t-bar.  After lookking at my options I decided in a Camaro or Firebird.  Well it did not take long to switch completly to the firebird.  Look at them, the Firebird looks so much better.  Yet, the Camaro does retain it's value a little better.  The Firebird looks so much nicier.  The car handles and drives great.  If you have the money you must go all the way for the trans-am convertible with ram-air.  They are beautiful and well worth the money.  The insurance can be a little high with the v-8 engine but if your a good driver it will not raise too high.<br><br>
