            When I started the Challenge series, I had little race training and NO race experience. This car held my hand from beginner to fairly competitive driving in just one season. I still have a long way to go, but it is certainly not the cars fault. 

To understand the TRUE cost of this car you have to add up all of the associated costs. The car costs approx. $170k, tack on another $150k to run the series every year, add $35k every time you hear bending metal or see smoke and don't forget the speeding tickets you new lead foot will bring you. It is not quite as expensive as a F1 season. In fact, my entire season cost about as much as the it costs for an F1 transmission. It is by no means cheap, but if you have the finances and the gonads, you would be a fool not to enjoy this incredible piece of automotive art.
