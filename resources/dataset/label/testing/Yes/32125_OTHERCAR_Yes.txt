            During a recent military deployment to Europe during the summer of 99, I had the chance of a lifetime: I got to drive many different types of automobiles from all over the world absolutely free, and with out the speed or performance restraints found within the United States. One car I absolutely fell in love with was the Daewoo Lanos. I drove the inexpensive five speed, no thrills 1999 model. I found its high take off speed, excellent handling on non-banked Italian mountain roads, and its basic accessory package of the heater, air conditioner, cloth interior, and AM/FM cassette radio basically appealed to my thrifty Yankee side. But what really astounded me was the gas mileage: this car got 45 miles to the gallon. I found this feature to be even more appealing when I found out that gas was 3500 lira, or about two (2) dollars a liter (say eight dollars a gallon). It was no wonder that I saw quite a few of these cars on the road in Italy.

Upon returning to the United States, I proceeded to look for Lanos. In December I finally found a dealer in Norman Oklahoma, that sold them. They had no 99 models: All they had was the new 2000's. I selected, and bought a White, Lanos 3 Door sedan with a five speed. The total price of the car, with my 151.00 trade-in (this car was essentially and accident waiting to happen) was exactly $9,548.00. It came with a 1.6 fuel injected engine, very decent cloth interior, cloth seats, AM/FM cassette radio, Air Conditioning, power assisted steering, and more. 
The first thing that really got my attention was the 36,000/3-year maintenance plan that does not cost the owner a penny. All of you basic maintenance needs (oil changes, coolants, lubricants) are checked, and replaced by the dealer free of charge. There were other warranty clauses offered free of charge which inclines me to believe that either Daewoo really believes in this product, or that they will relive the Chevy Biscayne Warranty Disaster of 1969. Either way, the consumer is going to win with this feature.
Driving the car home was a real eye opener: the handling of this car was wonderful. Only slight movements of the wheel were needed to maneuver on the car through some of the most congested traffic i have ever experienced. Once the car was placed in fifth gear, a light pressure on the gas pedal rapidly took the car to 70 MPH, with no sound of strain on the engine. Even at high speeds, drift and float were well tempered. The car responds well to full acceleration: it wasn�t a problem to pass the heavy semis and other vehicles. The ventilation, heating and cooling systems all functioned wonderfully: for the first winter in three years, i was finally warm and comfortable.
The body has the most unusual shape, especially the rear: if you look at it long enough, it appears to take the rounded shape of a large egg, with a finely tapered point. Most drivers that i passed did double takes when they saw me pass them: i hope that the newness of the shape wears off quickly, so they will stop passing me and slowing down to take a better look. in my opinion, this car has the shape of a Honda Civic, but more curvy. My daughter just calls it a spaceship. 
Currently, i am getting around 40 miles to the gallon, with the AC off, and using the fifth gear. I am well satisfied with this aspect of the car.
As with everything, there are minus's. The front seat belt clips are buried way to deep on the sides, and make snapping in a chore. The flimsy below the radio cup holder scares me: I do miss having a tachometer or an upshift light (shades of Volkswagen!) that would tell me the best time to shift. The rear does have a large blind spot offered by the right rear window, but makes up for this by providing a right door mirror. The ride on rough road is a little bumpy, but well within my tolerances. I do miss, but can live without a cruise control. The use of insulation has reduced the amount of road noise I experienced in Europe. 
In short, you get a solid, fast but economical, automobile with the right amount of luxury for under $10,000. My opinion: buy it before they totally Americanize it with so many options that it won�t be worth a hoot.
