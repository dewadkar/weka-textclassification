            Check out this car! Redesigned over the 2000 model. I drove 'em all: Sentra, Civic, Altima, Protege, 626, and the 2001 model beats all of them. 

Here's what it looks like:
1. The front-end looks like a Jag
2. The rear end looks like a BMW
3. The side looks like the new Mercedes C240

I'm not kidding, this car is killer. With all upgrades except sunroof,$13,606 including destination.

Tons of room inside. Great handling. Sporty. Power everything. And a killer stereo. 15 inch wheels, too. As for the smell everyone's talking about...what smell??? Also, as for the tinny sound when shutting the trunk, I found it to be the plastic license plate holder. Change it.<br><br>
