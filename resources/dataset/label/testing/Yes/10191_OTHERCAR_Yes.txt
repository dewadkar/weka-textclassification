            My wife and I were shopping for a SUV last year and it really narrowed
down to the Mercedes ML320/430 vs. the Lexus RX300.  We loved both cars,
the way it drives and such...  but being a previous owner of a Mercedes
450SEL, I was quite aware of the maintenance cost of the MB.  It is well known that even the best Mercedes will cost a lot to fix and if you happen to get a lemon, you're doomed.
Then we looked into the track record of the Lexus.  Like most Japanese cars, they are low in maintenance and extremely reliable.  So that was a plus for the Lexus.  The MB dealers are quite arrogant but the Lexus dealers pretty much kiss your feet all the way out the door.
As far as the looks go, well, the MB looks more like a van than a SUV, the Lexus is more slick and the interior is just beautiful.  The switches are easy to get to, the dashboard is clear and clean cut.  My 7 yrs. old son like the smell of new leather in the Lexus better and I loved the CD player and the sound system.
My last test was the &quot; slam the door&quot; test.  When I slam the door on the MB, it sounded like a tin can ( kind of like US cars ) but with the Lexus, it got that solid European heavy thump.  So that was it, the choice is clear.
I would recommend this car to any small family or individuals who want to have a solid and fun car to drive around, commute, or just for weekend drives.  This car is a dream.  And we can't ask for more.<br><br>
