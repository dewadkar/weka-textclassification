            I bought a '92 Shadow ES almost new in '93. It was my first car; previously I had driven the family cars. What attracted me to it was the styling, price, and features. I'm six feet tall, so buying a small car was rather difficult, as most seem built for slightly shorter people. In particular, I find that, in most small cars, if I adjust the seat so I can comfortably reach the pedals, I have to stretch to reach the steering wheel. Also, visibility is usually a problem, as my eyes sit too close to the roof for me to see stop lights and the like. In the Shadow, I feel comfortable reaching the pedals and the steering wheel, and visibility is good. On top of that, as a Chrysler product it had a number of nice refinements that might be unexpected in similar cars from other manufacturers. 
    What I bought was the ES two-door hatchback with manual transmission. Mine does not have cruise control, but it did have stereo cassette, rear window defrost, &quot;fog lamps&quot; (see below), tachometer, and a center console storage compartment. The hatchback gives great cargo space. The back seat folds down and the ledge behind the rear seat pops out to open up the cargo space. This space is about five feet deep and just over three feet wide at its narrowest. I've been able to fit a door--still boxed up--in this space, with less than a foot sticking out the back. Without any passengers, I can move the passenger seat up and fit seven-foot pipes or boards completely in the car with the hatchback closed. 
    It's been seven years and 100,000 miles since I bought the car, and it still runs just fine. The mileage has dropped from 28 mpg (mixed city/highway) to about 18 mpg (city)--possibly in need of new valves--and there's a small amount of rust showing on the hood and around the inside bottoms of the doors. There's also a slow oil leak around the valve cover gasket (fairly easy to fix) that amounts to a half to a full quart every three thousand miles. Otherwise the car is as good as new. It doesn't seem to be burning any oil. The paint still looks great when it's washed and waxed. The interior doesn't show excessive wear on the fabric or vinyl, and everything still works, including the parking break. The manual transmission has never needed any work beyond changing the transmission oil. The engine itself has not needed any major repairs, and the body and frame are still in good shape. 
    The Shadow has some nice features, too. The acceleration is first-rate for such a small engine (2.5L 4cyl); I've never wished for more. The turning radius is as small as any car I've seen. The Shadow can turn a circle in a space that our '92 Saturn would require a two-point turn. Such pep and maneuverability has been a real joy. One of the smaller touches that I appreciate is that the rear-window defrost is on a timer, so I don't have to worry about turning it off once it's been turned on. There are two cup holders that pull out of the dash beneath the radio. Having two is convenient, though when there are cups in them, your access to the radio becomes rather awkward. While there are no storage compartments in the doors, there is a center console storage box large enough for maps, tapes, and CDs; two trays around the stick for change, tire pressure gages, pens, note pads, or whatever; and the glove compartment contains ample room for maps, repair records, and the like. 
    Of course it isn't perfect. The exhaust has a tendency to rust out every few years. At 110,000 miles, I've had every break replaced two or three times (and I try to go easy on breaking), and the shocks have been replaced three times. I find also that I need to pay special attention to oil changes; it runs rough after about 2500 miles, so the oil change frequency is a little higher than I'd expect. It also seems to need a tune up every year or two, which isn't terribly expensive, but is an added cost compared to some other vehicles. The &quot;fog lamps,&quot; which sit below the headlights, don't actually function as fog lamps; they can only be turned on when the headlights are on, so they are functionally useless. 
    As a commuter vehicle with space for a little housework, this car excels. It's not a pickup, it's not the most fuel-efficient vehicle on the road, and it's probably not the most reliable vehicle, either. Yet there are few vehicles that combine the cargo capacity, performance, and fuel efficiency as well as this little car does. I feel comfortable recommending this car to anyone looking for an inexpensive car to use as their only vehicle.<br><br>
