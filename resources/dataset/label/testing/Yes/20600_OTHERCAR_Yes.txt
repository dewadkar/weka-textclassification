            Upon purchase of a new car, every owner undergoes a period of infatuation that may last three or four months. I have owned my A4 2.8 quattro for over two years now, and if the infatuation ever went away, I didn't notice. Could this be true love?

There are a multitude of reasons to love this car, not the least of which are its great looks, both inside and out. The car's beauty is subtle and understated, which appeals to me. To my eye, the exterior dimensions are perfectly proportioned, and the the body's form creates an ideal harmony between its crisp teutonic lines and smoothly rounded edges.

Inside, the cockpit is perhaps the most elegant of any car I have driven (including cars that cost up to 3 times as much). The 3-spoke steering wheel falls to hand perfectly, and all the controls are within easy reach. The instruments glow red, which is good for long drives at night (red = low wavelength = less eyestrain). All of these creature comforts create a nice environment to reflect on while you are sitting in LA traffic.

Of course, the real allure of this car is the driving experience. The handling of this car is just superb; the four-link suspension mated to Quattro make this car stick to the road like glue. The ride is extremely comfortable too, even on rough pavement. Even with such a smooth ride, you still get a good feel for the road through the steering wheel. 
Perhaps the best aspect of driving this car is that it is so forgiving when you make a mistake. This is because of the quattro all wheel drive system, which will prevent you from skidding or spinning out. This is particurly true in inclement weather, where the audi easily bests its rear wheel drive competition. As a fairly aggressive driver, I have found myself in a few situations where quattro saved the day, mostly in snow and rain.

Though the a4 doesn't accelerate as quickly as some of its competitors, I think this is a small price to pay for the benefit of all wheel drive (having to power all four wheels slows down the acceleration). If you're the kind of idiot who likes to waste his time (and the earth's fossil fuels) by racing at traffic lights, this isn't the car for you. However, if you want a car that will take you anywhere, in an snowstorm, in driving rain, and in style, then this is the car for you.<br><br>
