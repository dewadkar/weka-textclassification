            I have a large family of 5 boys and we bought our 99 Suburban to give us that much needed extra room for simple family outings and family vacations. 

The space the suburban gave us was just fantastic, we could now fit everyone comfortably and still have room to take all the extras without losing any of the extra space needed to make the trips enjoyable.

I loved to drive the vehicle to, it seemed very responsive and stable, was very light to drive when not in 4 wheel drive mode. On longer trips it was an absolute joy, it was like being seated in a train, it ran as if on rails and just kept on going.

The problems that I had with the vehicle were all to do with faults in the vehicle. When the 'Burban was only in its first 5000 miles I had two occasions when the brakes failed completely. On both occasions there was a fault in the master brake cylinder. The first occasion was just scary, while on the second occasion I had no option but to run into a pole to stop the vehicle. The dealer was superb in our treatment on both occasions and the fault was repaired quickly, at no expense to us, but it did raise major concerns from a safety viewpoint.

The second annoyance was the back doors. After about a year the seals on the backdoor seemed to lose some of there effectiveness. We had to have the vehicle in the shop to replace and  fix the way the back doors were sealing, and also to replace the back carpet on three different occasions. I don't care what anyone says, if the vehicle is in the shop more than once for the same problem they should be getting it right.

All and all I loved my 'Burban but hated the shortfalls that all seemed to be design faults.<br><br>
