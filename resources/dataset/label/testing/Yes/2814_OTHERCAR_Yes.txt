            I flipped and rolled my Chevy S-10, manual shift, extended cab truck through a cow pasture on a mountain in Tennessee. The truck was a total loss.  I can't decide if the truck saved my life or contributed to my injuries. I thought how well this truck held up in a wreck might be of interest and value to other people.

I bought the truck new in 1996.  I needed a reliable, drive-every-day vehicle that could carry kids and groceries as well as lumber and fencing. As far as mechanical failure, the compressor for the air conditioner went out at about 90,000 miles and I had to replace an &quot;o&quot; ring at 100,000. 

I dearly loved the truck.  It drove and shifted like a dream.  In 1996 and 1997, I was commuting to and from work and putting 250 miles a day on it. It never overheated even in the stop and go traffic in and out of Nashville. The seats were comfortable and all the knobs for the heat/air/radio were conveniently placed.

The accident I had was not due to any mechanical failure of the truck but
from hydroplaning at forty miles an hour on unseen standing water. The
truck turned sideways in the road, skidded into a ditch and rolled three times, according to an eyewitness.  I was aware of some of the things going on inside the truck, which is the reason for this review.

My seat belt failed and the buckle end of it slapped me across the chin during one roll.  I watched it recoil into the driver's side as I was thrown into the passenger side.  The police officer at the hospital told me that this is not a rare happening.  He said 20/20 or Dateline had run a feature in which they took a standard video tape holder and smacked the
side of the seat belt (the part that the buckle inserts into) and time
after time, the belt simply popped loose.  The officer said anything inside the truck could have hit or bumped it causing it to let go.  This fault is not strictly limited to the Chevy S-10 but the same failures have been reported in many other vehicles as well--and not just trucks.  

I think that had the belt held, I would have had few, if any, serious injuries. My back was injured when I fell into the passenger side and my spine hit the window frame (it was during this roll that the seat belt buckle hit me and I watched it recoil).  My right hip was broken when my leg got caught between the steering wheel and gear shift and my left elbow was shattered at the same time my back was injured when my elbow slammed into the passenger door.

My husband took photos of the truck and it held up remarkably well considering all the rolling.  The rear window was broken out as were the two smaller windows in the extended cab portion of the truck.  The windshield was cracked from side to side but remained in place.  At the time of the wreck, I thought both the driver's side and passenger windows had been broken out but later learned (from the wrecker service) that both
of those windows had slid off their tracks and fallen inside the doors. Neither of them were broken (which probably explains why I had very few cuts).  When the truck stopped rolling, I was wedged between the passenger seat and the frame of the truck.  The passenger seat had broken and was
lying on top of one of the small seats in the extended portion of the truck.  For this reason, I will never buy another truck with those type seats in the back.  Spending the extra money for a truck with a full rear seat could definitely save a child's life. 

The S-10 framework must be very well designed because after rolling three times, I expected to see the truck top completely flattened.  It wasn't.
It was crushed and somewhat bent but didn't look nearly as terrible as I thought it would.

Would I buy another one? Definitely--provided that I could get a full seat for the extended cab section AND the seat belts passed the smack'em test
(which I did using a video case to the amazement of the salesman before I bought a car).

Would I recommend this truck? Only to people who would not place a living being in the extended cab portion (well, I might make an exception for ex-spouses and troublesome in-laws). One other thing, fast-food toys become missiles in a rolling vehicle.  Ronald punched me in the eye.<br><br>
