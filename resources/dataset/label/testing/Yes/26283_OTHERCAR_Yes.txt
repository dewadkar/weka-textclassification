            Picture this...You're in your new black 2000 civic ex with your moonroof, front and passenger windows all rolled down since it a clear day with a slight breeze...You're going about 70mph and all u can hear is the music of the Beastie Boys blaring from ur new car...If this is the image that u are looking to convey feel free to call your nearest Honda dealership. This car is certainly an accomplishment.  It actually set the pace for the other honda cars because of it sporty, sleek look.  They have done a fabulous job on the craftsmanship of the interior by adding an AM/FM stereo cd player w/clock and 6 speakers not to mention a readable tachometer, since these two are the most important features of the full honda driving experience.  What else do u do while you're stuck in traffic averaging only traveling a distance of 5 miles in the last hour?...its probably something with those two features not to mention the AC especially in the TEXAS heat..  This is not the only thing that got my attention from going to a toyota or mazda...Actually, what caught my eye was the shape, style, and the endless possiblities of adding modifications since that $50000 dollar lexus is out of my student range.  The civic is still equipped with enough horsepower that can allow it handle any Dallas traffic situation even in slick conditions since it comes equipped with ABS.  With all this in mind, I was very satisfied with the final cost of this vehicle.  This car does have all these benefits but I would have to recommend to people with large families they invest in a larger, roomier car such as the Accord or Camry. By the way I LOVE DRIVING this car....<br><br>
