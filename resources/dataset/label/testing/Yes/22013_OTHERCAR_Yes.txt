            1997 was the second year for the new Caravan skin and it is quite an attractive one. We traded in a 1995 Geo Prizm for a base Caravan with A/C as the only mentionable option. We needed the additional space with a baby on the way and boy what a difference between the tight confines of a compact car and the expansive roominess of the Caravan!! We liked the more commanding view we had with the Caravan's open greenhouse, although we wish we had opted for privacy glass in order to shade our newborn son from the hot sun. Stick-on minishades were the temporary fix and they worked well. Dodge may have erred by allowing a vehicle of this size and weight to be pulled by a rather smallish 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine. On one trip to visit family in Florida the van just stopped completely on I95. Luckily, we had enough forward motion to coast to the next rest stop. After repairs were made (the timing belt snapped!) we were again on our way. All repairs were made under warranty and in a timely manner. This is the only problem we had with the van for the duration of it's stay with us. I would have to say that the low step in and comfortable seats were it's best assets. The A/C was strong enough to cool the whole van in 3 - 5 minutes in the searing heat. Although the van is built on the archaic K car platform, it's handling was very impressive. The brakes were up to the task of stopping this fairly heavy vehicle in short order. I wish I could have afforded options such as an in-dash cassette player and rear defrost which were sorely missed. I would say the overall fit and finish of the Caravan is very good. Overall fuel economy was decent at about 18 city and 25 highway.
