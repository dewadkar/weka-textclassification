            I was looking for a good digital camera when I came across the Olympus 360L.  I wanted one that has great quality, but didn't break my wallet.  So I decided to get it, and boy was I pleased!

<b>The Specs:</b>
- The Olympus digital camera has 1.3 million pixel resolution with a 2x digital zoom.
- 1.8 Color LCD display
- Pictures can be taken in either SHQ, HQ, JPEG, or TIFF format
- The camera operates on 8 mb removable smartmedia card with 4 AA batteries.
- The camera has six different flash modes with a red eye reduction system.
- There are three different ISO settings at 125/250/500
- Spot metering
- A panoramic function when using Olympus cards
- A serial connection to your commuter
- A Timer with a 10-12 second delay

This being my first digital camera, I was quite amazed by what this wonder can do.  The LCD screen moved quite smoothly, not jerky like other cameras. There are three resolutions at which you can set the camera.  The mdeium resolution can yield 36 shots, while the highest resolution can only produce 18 shots.  There are many options such as red eye reduction and the ability to take panoramic pictures.  The only gripe I had with this camera was the serial connection to the PC.  I was really hoping for a USB adapter, but it wasn't included.  The download times were not too long, but I didn't like the fact that I had to turn off and reboot my PC just to download some pics from the camera.  The hot-swappable nature of USB is greatly missed.  Another minor quirk was the batteries - they were not rechargeable.  If you use the LCD screen constantly, the batteries drain very quickly, less than an hour of life.  But other than that, the pictures that are reproduced boast great color and quality.  I highly recommend this camera for both newbies and enthusiasts!<br><br>
