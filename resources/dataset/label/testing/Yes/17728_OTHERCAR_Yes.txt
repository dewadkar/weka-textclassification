            I just test drove a 1994 saturn that a local dealer had on the lot I was fairly impressed with the handling and the overall driving of the car, in a automatic it feels alittle powerless but when you have a 5 speed it feels much more like a sports car.  I didn't like the way the cabin was set up for the driver the window wiper switch is hard to find at first and the seats are set up badly.  The one I drove had the five speed in it and it was very easy to drive.  The car had 58,000 miles on it and ran extremily well for for a car that was six years old and had almost 60,000 miles.  I was really liked the body of the car with the spoiler on it.  <br><br>
