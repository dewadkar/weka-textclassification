            I can't believe how easy and accessible Sony makes digital images available to the consumer.  I think its strongest asset is the ease of the floppy insert and removal.  Just point, click, remove the floppy and put it into your pc.  Another strong advantage is the option to create about a 1 minute long MPEG using the camera and holding down the shoot button.  I was delightfully surprised at the quality and graphic effects available right on the camera itself.

If there would be one draw back, it would be the lack of internal disk space to save images for later download.  I find myself carrying alot of floppies around to get every picture that I want.
