            I used to love Corvettes.  Never owned one and always wanted one.  Then I bought my first Jeep Cherokee Sport with a 6 cylinder engine in 1994. Bright red spanking beautiful.  I don't know if I could ever live without a Jeep again.  It was bought because I thought they were sort of nice but mainly because we had a sincere need to get up our 80 degree sloped driveway when it snowed. It is manual and I never used to be great at shifting but now am a shifting expert.  It was more fun driving than I ever imagined a Corvette would be, unless of course, you have a really old Corvette in excellent condition.  

My Jeep has been one of my best friends, it's been there through good times.   It definitely has been there through the storms that we have here in the midwest.  I've never seen a snow storm we could not make it through.   Any mechanical problems??? Not one mechanical problem and she is still running fine.  The only problem was my honking horn quit working and some yahoo put a new one in upside down!!!! Can you believe that one??  Oh well, one day I'm sure I will have to put  my fire engine Jeep to rest but I'll enjoy her while I still have her.<br><br>
