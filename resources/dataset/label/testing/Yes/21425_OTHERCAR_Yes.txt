            This is a beautifully and thoughtfully put together car for the money.  Nicely styled, it doesn't look or feel cheap, except when you slam the trunk lid! Then it sounds tinny, but hey, this ain't a Benz!  The trunk is CAVERNOUS, and nicely carpeted.  The doors have a fairly solid and confidence-inspiring "thunk" when you close them.  Paint job is A .  Power windows with auto-down feature (driver only) and remote mirrors are a nice touch. The engine produces 140 horse power (which is a lot for a small car)and hums like a Swiss watch, and acceleration never ceases to amaze me for a car in this class...awesome, smooth power delivery through the gears, with an unexpectedly pleasant engine drone that I actually like listening to.  You driving enthusiasts will know what I mean.  Front seats are almost sports-car firm, and actually have a manual lumbar support bar!  Very comfortable for long trips. The rear seats can hold 3 average sized adults, at least for short trips, but the center passenger only gets a lap belt.  Outboard rear passengers get head rests that, even in the lowest position, should reduce the likelihood of whiplash in a rear-end collision.
