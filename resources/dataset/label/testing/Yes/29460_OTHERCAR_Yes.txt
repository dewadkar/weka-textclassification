            Upon turning 21 and getting a good job I decided it was time to make a major investment.  That investment turned out to be a 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  At the time I bought it, my baby was brand new.  I've always wanted a Jeep, and at this point in my life where my financial burdens are low, it seemed like the right thing to do.  Here's a little bio on my jeep-'99 Wrangler Sport, Gunmetal body, black denim hard top, black hard top, Alloy 5 star wheels, dual airbags, Straight 6-cylinder,4.0 Liter, Automatic 3 speed transmission, Leather steering wheel wrap, cassette/Am FM radio, cloth seats, sound bar.  I also added fog lights, bug deflector, factory replica side steps, door entry guards, tailgate organizer, locking gas cap, hood lock, and an alarm system.  So far, I am very happy with my decision.  But, be warned, Jeeps aren't for everyone.  I'll start with some pros, end with some cons and them sum up my overall opinion.

Pros-
Extreme Cool Value - You will be the envy of many a passerby when you cruise through town with the top down and the wind blowing through your hair.
Off-raod Capabilites - Jeeps come built for four wheeling, but there are also a ton of resources and accessories that will help you better equip your Jeep for rough terrain.  
Individuality - No 2 Jeeps are ever the same.  With all of the accessories available you can personalize your Jeep in a million different ways.  
4 Wheel Drive - Possibly my favorite feature so far.  It's great for when there's 6 inches of snow or if you just want to go ripping around in the mud.
Easy Maintenance - This baby is easy to clean!  The rear seats are removable and the carpet comes competely out,plus there are drainage holes in the floor, so you can go as far as getting the hose and spraying your floor out!  
Size - I really like the fact that I can fit into all of the parking spaces that others feel are too small or too cramped. 
Adaptability - Soft top and Convertible in the Summer, Hard top and heating system in the winter make this the perfect vehicle for year round temps. 

Okay, now for the cons
Gas milage - What can you say, not very good.  I may get anywhere from 20 miles per gallon to 12 miles per gallon depending on what kind of traveling I am doing.  
Cab Space - Hauling 1 person is no problem, but putting people in the back seat can be a pain.
Trunk Space - Slim to No belongings will fit in your trunk.  I bought a tailgate organizer for mine to get the little stuff out of the way and that helps, but I can hardly fit all of my groceries in theback without folding up the back seat.
Cost - for the amount of practicality this vehicle offers it has a very high tag.  

So my verdict is, if this is more of a receational vehicle, GO FOR IT!  But if you're looking for the next family trolley, the Jeep just won't cut it.  Personally, I still love my decision and plan to keep it forever, but I realize that eventually I will have to purchase another vehicle for all practical purposes.<br><br>
