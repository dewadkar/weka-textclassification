            I purchased this camera a week before Christmas and have used it almost daily ever since.  I keep looking for the faults that I have read in magazine reviews, but can't find them in my own experience.  I have printed large numbers of 3x5's and 4x6's with no problem.  I even printed an indoor 8x10 shot of my son which turned out spectacular.  I do shoot in the highest pixel mode as I am using this camera to replace my Sony 35mm point and shoot which shot beautiful pictures.  I can honestly say this camera produces much better colors. The ease and choice of what to print has sold me completely on using Digital. 

The camera comes with charger, rechargeable batteries and a 16mb SmartMedia card and USB cable. Software comes with and was a snap to install on my Win ME machine. Battery life seems quite long considering I use the LCD screen all the time. It is light weight and I am able to carry it with me daily in a small handbag. 
  
I did try 2 other cameras during the month of December (same price range) and over all, this camera stood out clearly. If you are looking for a basic point and shoot replacement with zoom, this camera can't be beat for the price.
