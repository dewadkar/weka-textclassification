            We bought our new Chevrolet Conversion Van just before Thanksgiving.  A few days later we headed off on a road trip to Arizona.  I have never had such an enjoyable road trip!  There is plenty of room for the two of us, two kids, grandma, and two dogs!  The tv makes it a joy, keeps the kids entertained, lol.  I will always have a van now!  The ride is smooth, it handles nicely on the ice, has the power to pass even on hills!  The gas mileage has been great.  Even with all the luggage and shopping that we did, there was still even room to bring my sister-in-law home with us too!  I am truely glad I bought this van.<br><br>
