            Compared to the GMC Jimmy and Ford Explorer there is much more room.  I travel to many School functions (basketball games, football games).  I pack coolers and even fold the back down and make a bed for my children when they get tired and want to lay down.  The ride is very comfortable.  I feel far more safe in this vehicle because you sit so much higher in this vehicle than you do a car which makes it easier to see the area around you.  The front and back interior lamp lights is very much a plus.

There are only a few quirks that the Tahoe has.  One of the drink holders and is located directly in front of the air/heat vents.  Also, the amount of air that flows through the heat/air vents is really not as much as it should be.  Other than that, I am very, very pleased with my Tahoe...
