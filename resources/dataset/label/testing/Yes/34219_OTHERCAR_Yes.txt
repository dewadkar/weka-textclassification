            The 2004 Grand Prix GT1 is a rental from Enterprise.  I've been driving it since mid July while my vehicle is in the body shop for repairs. My Audi A6 Avant wagon was creamed by a gent who pulled out in front of me trying to get across 4 lanes of traffic just outside of Pittsburgh, PA - so I've had plenty of time to evaluate the Pontiac.  I've put a little over 3000 miles on this car in the month and a half that it's been in my possession, and it's not a bad car.  I am a rep for a large computer firm based in Palo Alto, Ca, and drive about 600 to 700 miles a week.  The majority of my driving is on the PA Turnpike, but I have some accounts that are accessed though hilly, back country twisties in Somerset County, Indiana, and Clarion, PA.   My impressions:

Pros:
Very neutral handling

Great ride, very quiet at speed.

Sexy good looks, swoopy hawk-like nose - kinda like a baby Bonneville

Excellent legroom for front seat passengers

Responsive engine - very quick

Good mileage

Great brakes

Ok sound system

Immense storage capacity with 60/40 flip down rear seats  

Cons:
Limited outward visibility - this car has a big butt - hard to see where you're going when in reverse.  With the low roof, the pillars in the front and rear are very thick, creating wonderful blind spots.

Windshield has ripples in it - and the rear defogger wires also make it difficult to see out of the rear window

Low door sills - I'm 6' 2" and have bumped my head many times exiting the vehicle - have to bend down to get out

Horrific rear seating space - it's like sitting in a big cup- no legroom and no support for your rear end and back

Way too much plastic on the dash and interior of this car - I know - I'm spoiled after driving an Audi, but the GT1 has a truly soulless interior.  If Darth Vader could come back to life as a car, he'd be a new Grand Prix. Dull. At least get some faux wood going on the dash or something....

No telescoping steering wheel - are there any cars from GM that offer this?

Cup holders and ash tray missing for rear seat riders - it's possible that Pontiac decided that folks would be so uncomfortable in the back seat, that no one would wanna ride back there

Lack of lower lumbar support for the driver's seat in the base GT1 offering

Last points:  Get rid of the spoiler on the trunk.  When washing the car, I found that a tremendous amount of dirt gathers UNDER the spoiler.  Why not ditch it, and put the center brake lamp in the lower part of the rear window?  It might even improve the drag coefficient of this vehicle and make the car look better!  Also, the large fog lamps catch a lot of bugs in the crevices - they are hard as hell to clean.
