              My red 2000 Daewoo Lanos sedan surprised me in many ways the past nine months Ive owned it. When I first saw it, what got my attention was its exterior design. To me it resembled a BMW with its Chrome badge and hood curves. They also come with great a paint job thats easy to sparkle. I also noticed its low profile tires thats also relatively wide for a small car. The chassis of the Lanos is designed by the professionals at Porshe and it shows. Im greatly impressed with its braking distance of 70-0 in a short 179 feet !  Thats only 8 feet longer than the expensive Dodge Viper at 171 feet ! Its handling is also nice for any car for less than $20,000 . It hangs turns down the twisty Georgia back roads and give confidence at all speed . Acceleration is torquey in speeds below 50 . The Daewoo Lanos has good enough power to beat most cars ( 2001 Civics ,Focuses, Neons,Accents,etc.)at the stoplight from 0-50 with ease. With proper shift from Neutral to Drive, PWR on,  A\C off, and heavy feet, the front wheels spin for a second and leave most small cars behind. At speeds approaching 50 mph with the petal to metal, the transmission shifts to 4th entirely too late and cause higher hp cars(Accords and Camrys)to pass . The car controls excellent at all speeds and its 105 hp engine is powerful enough to cruise down I-75 at 85 mph easily . It feels steady all the way to its electronically limited top speed of 105 mph .
  The interior is surrounded with tightly wrapped plastic which is a little cheezy but this is expected for one of the least expensive sedans in America . The seats are supportive for hours of driving , but the bulky twist knobs creates hassle when wanting fast adjusting . Otherwise the interior is just as nice as Hyundai or Kia (Well better than Kia).
   As a 17 year old Wal-mart associate on the way to college , this is the car to drive . Daewoo obviously researched what young men like; performance , quality , value , style , and trust worthy . The Lanos comes with 4 powerful speakers that create plenty of boom when hooked up to my Alpine CD player I bought from Circiut City . And now the future for Daewoo is more clear now that its Billion dollar income finally came in to pay for its debts . Also GM and Fiat plans to support Daewoos future. When I first bought my Daewoo in 2000 in the fall, everyone liked it but never heard of it . Out of 500 cars in my highschool parkinglot it was the only Daewoo , just before summer came there were 4 out there. Does that mean anything?
