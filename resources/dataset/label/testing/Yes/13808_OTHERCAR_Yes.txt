            Obviously when you hear the name Mercedes-Benz, you know about the excellent quality of their cars just by the name.  Well, the new 2000 S-Class vehicles are a step above any previously released S-Class.  Although Mercedes decided not to release the 600 models for 2000, I am sure that it will come out for 2001.  The reason this car is still the best luxury car out there it's because of its power and handling and luxury all put into one.  The engines on the smallest of the S class (320) are still very powerful and would outrun any engines of any of its competitor cars (Lexus LS400, BMW 528i or any Acura).  There is not much to hate about the S-Class but the price does keep on rising a bit every year.  The new 2000 S500 is based at 95,000 and you cannot get the smallest S-Class for cheaper than 72,000.  This is probably the only disadvantage this car has.  I assure you though, if you are willing to spend that much money on a car, this one is most definitely worth it.  You will find any other car that has put such great luxury and power in one.  If you are a person who enjoys luxury but is also the kind who is not afraid to kick it up a few notches on the freeway, the S-Class is definitely for you.  A Definite buy.<br><br>
