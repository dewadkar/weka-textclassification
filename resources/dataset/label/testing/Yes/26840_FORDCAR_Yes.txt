            The Expedition has now become the middle SUV child for Ford, sliding in between the Explorer and Excursion.  I recently drove a 1999 Eddie Bauer version with the 4.6 V-8, Leather and Mach 460.Larger than the Explorer and smaller than the Excursion, the Expedition is just the right size for most people who feel the &quot;need&quot; for an SUV.  The only drawbacks on the interior of this vehicle are the lack of luggage space behind the third seat, on vehicles so equipped.  A luggage rack is a necessity if you are carrying more than five people and their gear.  Also, you would think that on a $35,000 vehicle you would have a power lumbar adjustment for the seat, and not a manual crank.The power pedals are a great option, allowing a 3 inch fore/aft adjustment of the driving pedals, great for those with shorter legs who don't want to sit on top of the steering wheel.The signal mirrors are another cool option, allowing those to your side and rear to see your intentions when changing lanes.  When the turn signals are activated, an illuminated arrow is visible to those behing you, letting them know what you are going to do.  It is not visible to the Expeditions driver.Around town and on the highway, the 4.6 V-8 is more than adequate.  Save the 5.4 option for towing.  It fits well into most parking places and provides excellent 360 degreee vision with minimal blind spots.IN conclusion, the Expedition is a great vehicle, making a great purchase for those who need more brawn than the Explorer.<br><br>
