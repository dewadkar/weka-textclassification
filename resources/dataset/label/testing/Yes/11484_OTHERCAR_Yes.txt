            I had a 1995 SL1 for six years and am preparing to unload it. In the early years, it served me well. While reliability seemed above average, this seemed to diminish drastically when the mileage reached over 50,000. I went thru 2 alternators, a belt problem, a radiator problem, and I'm not sure this was on the level, but the oil pan had to be replaced because a screw bolt broke during an oil change. 
The cassette deck that came with the car broke at about 60,000 miles. The reason why I'm trading it now at 93,000 is because it has a transmission leak that a $140 repair didn't fix, and its starting to burn oil. 

I have to admit though, the rear bumper on the car is quite strong, as mine was hit from behind rather harshly, with very little damage. Also, the interior upholstery held up quite well considering my 2 boys kept jumping around on it. The exterior also held up quite nicely.
