            The Ford Ranger I thing is one of the best light trucks on the market. You have to be sure of what you buy when you buy used though. For example be sure you check out the 4X4 when you test drive. The inter workings are very delecate and you have to be sure that it works or down the line you WILL pay the price. It is a well built vehical that can take on the millage with out a problem. The extended cab is the best choice for thoughts over 6 feet in height unless you like your knees kissing the dash. Bucket seats are comfortable but the center consoul between the seets can be cumbersome if you get a standard. the bench seat works out well with the stick though and it does have a fold down center compartment between the seats. In all the Truck works hard and earns the money you pay for it. It looks great and drives well. It drives like a car but shifting is different with the gearing ratio. <br><br>
