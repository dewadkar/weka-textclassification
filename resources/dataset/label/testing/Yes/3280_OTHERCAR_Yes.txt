              My (dads) 1990 Nissan King Cab is my vehicle of choice for most of the year.  The two things I dislike the most about it are that it is not a large truck, and it is not four wheel drive.  I cannot fault it because of these things because these are what the truck is supposed to be.  
  I only started driving this truck when it had 110,000 abusive miles on it, so any criticisms I have about its handling may be due to that.  Riding in it can be a fairly bumpy experience, but it is not terrible.  Shifting with it is not as easy as with my subaru, but once you get used to it it's fine.  It does not have an rpm gauge, but that is also only a minor thing.  There is some rust on it, but not much. Those are the only faults that I can think off right now.
  We've had to take this truck to the shop several times, but those were either our fault or acts of god.
  As I said before, this truck is 2wd.  For most of the year this is okay. During the Spring it has been known to get stuck in mud on the narrow dirt roads around my house, but so have many vehicles.  During Winter the roads get icy and dangerous, especially so in this truck.  During the Winter when I first got my drivers license I tried driving it to the dump.  I was sliding all over the road.  This was partially due to my inexperience, but also partly due to the truck.  When my dad took over driving to &quot;show me how it's done&quot; he also had some trouble.  Driving it during the Winter is definitely do-able, but during especially bad weather I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a very skilled driver.
  After all this bad stuff, I must say that I really do like this truck a lot.  I guess this is just a fun truck to drive.  Unlike my friends huge f-150 it can accelerate decently.  The seats are comfortable.  The extra cab space is useful for storing things, although I wouldn't recommend storing people there unless they are very small, because it isn't very comfortable (I know from experience)
  So, If you're not willing to shell out big bucks for a big 4x4 that you can take off-roading, I would definitely recommend the nissan king cab.  It does pretty much all the things that I expect a truck to do.  I actually have not towed anything big with it (haven't had a need,) but judging from the trucks small size and its 2wd it probably doesn't do that the best.<br><br>
