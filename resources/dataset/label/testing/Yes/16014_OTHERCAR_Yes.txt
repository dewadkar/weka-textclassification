            I've never really driven foreign cars very much.  I was forced to rent this Camry because my car is in the shop and I'm glad for it.

The 2001 Camry provides a very nice ride.

Comfort.
I don't really like low riding cars, but getting into and out of this one isn't too bad.  Even though this particular vehicle had been worked over a bit, it was still comfortable.  There is some room in the car as well.  It doesn't really have a compact feel - although I'm not sure you'd categorize it as a mid-size.  The ride is smooth, and you don't get a lot of road roughness.  Everything you need is at hand in a variety of buttons, making it easy to control your environment.

Noise.
There is very little road noise, even over rough surfaces - and this is a rental that's had a lot of miles put on it.  There's also very little wind noise, which was a surprise because the model I drove had a sunroof.  I expected the seal to be less than perfect, but it wasn't.  There was no sound from the sunroof - except when open.  Engine noise was very low, too.  You could hear the music, or just your own thoughts.  The car seems solid, too - the door closing with an authoritative thump.  This probably adds to the quiet.

Handling.
After driving larger cars and minivans I guess a smaller car would offer very different handling.  Still, this little baby moves.  The steering is tight and responsive.  Not that I was driving a slolem, mind you, but city traffic offers its own obstacles.  The car does not hesitate or wander.  And it seems to hug the road.

Pickup.
Again, the Camry is very responsive.  Pickup is instantaneous.  I haven't tried it on highway passing, but within town the car is able to accelerate quickly and dart around as needed.  Conversely, although emergency stopping hasn't been necessary, braking is smooth.  It feels secure.

Visibility.
There seems to be ample visibility in this vehicle.  Of course, I'm used to sitting higher and seeing more.  Also, I really like having a rear window wiper.  This car does not have it, and it probably never will.  Still, you see the road and the world around you.

Some nitpicky things.
I've never liked when the air filtration system is always on.  I prefer that when the fan says OFF that it be off and that it not suck air in through driving.  Also, the brights switch is in a place that makes it too easy to activate. Third, there is a separate clock.  Some cars have the clock in the radio and always have that part of the radio on.  Other cars, like the Camry have separate clocks.  I'm not sure which I like, but if you're going to have a separate clock, it should be just above the radio, not above and to the left.  Of course, you could get used to it.  Finally, while the sun roof is a great feature, I would have put in a little more functionality.  Using the only two switches available, it can be difficult to close the sun roof completely without paying strict attention.  Again, maybe this is just something to get used to.

BTW ... the $10 price is what I'm co-paying for the daily rental.
