            I have owned this camera for over 1yr. at this time and have taken thousands of photos with it. I  am a very satisfied customer as you will see below. I would recommend this to anyone that loves to take both snapshots of the family or even more involved compositions. On the technical side, the red eye reduction works very well, exposure control is automatic with a manual override feature. White balance is very good  and the auto flash works well for illumination and fill. The software included is easy to use and enough for most people. Both PC and MAC versions  are supplied. The 8MB Flash memory card that is included has a large enough capacity for most outings or projects but it's a good idea to buy more memory if you don't have a laptop handy. I would also suggest rechargable batteries because the LCD display is a really nice feature but takes a lot of juice. These suggestions apply to most all of  the light weight compact cameras so don't let  this deter you in any way.
