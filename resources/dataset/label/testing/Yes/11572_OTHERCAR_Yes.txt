            I recently purchased my fifth Chevy truck since 1973.  My last Chevy Silverado Extended Cab Pickup was a 1988.  It went through three hail storms, rear ended 4 times (3 of the other 4 vehicles were totaled), and had 236,000 miles on it when I sold it (and was still going strong).  My wife threatened me with my life if I didn't get her another Chevy Extended Cab.  Swears the truck is what made the difference in saving her life when she was rear ended by a drunk driver (one of the totaled others).

I waivered between the Toyota Tundra (nice truck) and the Chevy Silverado.  My wife and I each drove both trucks at separate times.  Finally, we both went together to a dealer that owned a Chevy lot on one side of the street and a Toyota lot on the other.  We drove two different Chevy Silverado's.  Then we took the Chevy across the street and put beside the Toyota.  No comparison.  The Chevy was definitely the nicer truck!  We then took the Toyota out for a drive. We were only a block down the road when we knew that the Chevy was definitely the one.

The Chevy had the smoother ride, better take-off, larger payload capacity, deeper and longer bed, larger towing capacity, better console, larger interior compartment, and was much more comfortable.  Downside, the armrests are too close in for comfort.  Interior designers could take some tips, but not many, from Toyota.

The Toyota had a few perq's better than the Chevy.  17&quot; wheels.  Car phone accessory better located for passenger.  Much better sun visors.  Better gas mileage.  Tighter turner radius, thus, easier for city driving and parking.

Price was comparable on both.  My reason for considering the Toyota originally was the extra miles my friends had been able to put on their vehicles (excess of 400,000).  On the other hand my last Chevy was 12 years old with 236,000 miles.  I would have to drive it another 10 years to reach 400,000 miles.  Plus I just couldn't get over the way the top of it looked so much like the old Dodge pickups.  Yuch!

Buy Chevy!<br><br>
