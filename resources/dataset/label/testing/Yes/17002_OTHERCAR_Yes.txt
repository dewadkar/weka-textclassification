            2001 Acura MDX is a great vehicle for the family since it can seat 7 passenger.  Equipped with VTEC V6 engine, this 5-speed SUV showed proof of its worth a few days ago.  I test drove it so you don't have to.  I found out that it provides great performance on the road.  With its slick exterior, it causes many fellow drivers to take a second look.  For sure, it's a head-turner!

<b>This Acura MDX reminds me of the Durango XLT</b>

Before you enter this vehicle, you will realize it's pretty grand.  Once inside, it appears even wider and bigger.  I enjoyed the passenger's seat area since I had to let the sales person drive it out of the dealership.  After showing proof of insurance and giving them a copy of driver's license for security reasons, we were ready to hit the road.  At that point, he let me know about the company's policies to drive the vehicle not only out of the lot but also to a specific point designated by the manager.  Only then did I get behind the wheels.  I then proceeded to adjust the seat to fit my size and height.  I just fell in love with its panel.  It has all kinds of gadgets to die for.  I drove the MDX to the nearest freeway because I wanted to see how it would fair when I glued my foot on the accelerator.  To tell you the truth, it did not disappoint me at all.  Approaching the freeway after stopping at a gas station, I did not have to worry about the oncoming big rig.  I knew that I would beat it at its own game.  (Drive safely. Respect the speed of those suckers!)

Even though MDX is available in only one model, you won't get disappointed.  You can either get it with the 5-speed or the automatic transmission.  It beats most of its competitors such as 2001 Ford Explorer, 2001 Nissan Pathfinder, 2001 4Runner etc. It has all the standard features new SUVs come equipped with.  With a 6-disc CD changer, you will take advantage of its Aurora/Bose music.  Most importantly, it has the side impact protection and dual airbags for driver and passenger.  It has lots of features you want to secure your investment.  A remote keyless entry is very important.  If you want more specific options, you can order them.

If you are looking for a new SUV, I would advise you to consider this one.
