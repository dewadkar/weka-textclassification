            The Sony DSC-F55 digital camera is an excellent easy to use camera with great picture quality.  I have owned one for about 5 months and have no major complaints.  It is really great to take pictures and not worry about developing the film.  The camera is exceptionally useful when equipped with 32mb memory card rather than the provided 4mb card.  I've been able to take over 50 best quality pictures on one memory card.  
The rotating lens design is a very nice touch, makes it easy to take pictures of yourself.  The LCD display is clear and very nice.  It takes a while to get used to not looking through lens while taking a picture but that is not really a problem.  The camera has a nifty feature of taking mpegs (movies) of up to 60 sec in length.  Those are really great.  You can even play them back on the camera and hear the sound!!!  I have been able to send pictures and movies in different parts of the country and the world.  It comes in handy when you have family and loved ones living far away.  
The only draw backs that I can think about are the following:
Battery lasts about 45min-1hr....not long enough, especially if you need to use the flash.
The memory stick that comes with the camera is not sufficient especially if you want to take the high quality pictures.
The software provided with the camera is only adequate and does not allow for a lot of photo manipulation.
Download time from the camera to your PC is kind of slow.
All in all this camera is easy to use and takes excellent quality pictures.  <br><br>
