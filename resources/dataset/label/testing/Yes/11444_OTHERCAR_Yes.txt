            I purchased this camera after comparing it to the Sony FD series of cameras that use floppy media.  The main advantages I was interested in were the ability to store lots of images on cheap CDRW media.  This media allows you to store between 300 and 1000 images on one CD, depending on resolution.  You can also store MPEG movies, up to 90 minutes on one CD.  I use this camera for EBAY pictures and personal pictures.  One of the cool features of this camera is the audio/video output.  I work with a large youth group at church.  This allows me to take several hundred pictures at a retreat and then show them on a large screen in a slide show format allowing 5 seconds between images.  Transferring between PC and Camera is easy.  I don't even use the USB connection and software.  I simply transfer the cd back and forth.  You must remember to initialize the CD when you first put it in the camera.  Right before you transfer the cd into the PC, you need to "finalize" the CD.  This process is simply adding a Table of Contents so you can view from the PC.  I am not a camera expert and I am able to figure out all the features.  I have not read the manual too much.  The menu on the camera is easy to use and self explanatory to the camera novice.  I purchased this camera at Best buy for $599 less $100 rebate from Sony.  At that price, it's a no brainer to go with this camera vs. the Floppy Sony cameras.  I also prefer the CD media to the "memory stick" media promoted by Sony.  CDs are much cheaper and easier to work with than the memory sticks.  With this camera, there is no need to worry about memory sticks and you don't have the added expense of them.  I purchased the Extended 4 year warranty from Best Buy and I would highly recommend you do the same.  The warranty cost me $60.  Anytime you have an LCD panel display, that's enough reason alone to purchase the warranty.  If Best Buy can't fix it, they'll replace it.  Sony's Warranty is only 1 year with 90 days on labor.  My favorite thing about this camera is the ability to take a bunch of pictures and then plug in to a TV or video display unit to show your pictures.  For me this is a good camera for a combination of EBay use and personal use.
