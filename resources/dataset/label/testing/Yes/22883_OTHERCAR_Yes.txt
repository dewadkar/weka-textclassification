            Here's the background, as you may know, I'm a returning college student working on my last semester of computer science, i.e., I'm way broke. I could never afford a car like the Toyota Avalon, but fortunately for me, my grandmother left me her 95 fully loaded Avalon to me in her will.
Having not dropped down thirty grand for this baby, it's remarkably affordable, I think that in the last three years I've only had to get a new set of tires and the CD changer fixed. That's like $750, plus oil changes at say 35 bucks every four months, for 36 months it comes out to $32.50 a month to keep running. 
And run it does, I'm not the kind of guy who likes to drive in excess of say 90, but when I have ventured over 100 it ran as smoothly as it does at 65. How cool is that! before, I was driving an 87 camry, back when they were reliable not fast, with a four-banger that would struggle at 75.
The speed isn't what really sells me on the Avalon, or what keeps me from selling it, it's the ride. Everyone who rides in it comments on how smooth and how quietly the car runs. I'd almost say that I'm spoiled.
More important than ride though, is how well the car drives. I've taken my Avalon through three blizzards, on highways that had in excess of five inches of snow. I have to say that the only vehicle I've driven that handles better in heavy snow is my mom's land cruiser.
Also with ABS, driver and passenger airbags, and about 3400 pounds of steel keeping you safe, you can drive in comfort knowing that it's going to take something pretty big to actually cause an injury to you or the passengers.
The top end factory stereo is awesome. I'm not one of those creeps who likes to blast loud booming music, but this thing can. But who cares about power without sound quality. I don't think that I've heard a better factory audio system. I don't think that you can really make music sound much better in a car than the Avalon does. I haven't counted them, but I believe that there are four channels and a subwoofer. The front channel is split between a tweeter and a mid ranged woofer, and the rear speakers may be one or two-way speakers. My only complaint about the stereo is that the twelve disc cd changer in the trunk is vulnerable to dust and changes in humidity. I've found that when the climate changes that it may take a while for the cd's to adjust to the temperature in the trunk and become readable.
The only bad thing that this car ever caused me is that when my grandmother gave it to me, I was working for a small trade magazine that didn't pay any of us much. I don't think that my bosses appreciated it very much that I was driving a nicer car than they were. I was fired from that job a few months later, and I think that I'm way better off in the long run. Kids study computers, not journalism!
I don't know when I'll be in the market for a new car, but when I am it will be hard to find a car that will treat me better than the Avalon that my grandma gave me. RIP<br><br>
