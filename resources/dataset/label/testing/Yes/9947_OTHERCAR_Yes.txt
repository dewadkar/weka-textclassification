            I bought my 1994 Geo Prizm in May of 1999.  It had about 70K miles on in, but it was in great shape overall.  My husband and his best friend both drove Prizms, and they both recommended them to me.  During the time I've had mine, it's taken me from Maine to Virginia and Maine to Ohio with no problems.  In fact, the only problem I've had with it was a battery that needed to be replaced, but that will happen in any older car eventually.

My car is sort of a boring blue-green color.  It has dual airbags, air conditioning, and a CD player I installed myself.  It has no other options.  No power locks or windows, no sunroof, no truck pop, not even intermittent  wipers.  It's small, but the front seats are fairly comfortable, even for long trips.  It's a bare-bones kind of car.   It has no flash or sporty appeal at all.  But if you can get over how utterly dull it is, it's a great value.  A Geo Prizm is essentially a Toyota Corolla with different nameplates.  It's reliable, safe, fuel efficient, everything you'd expect from a Corolla.  It's also MUCH cheaper.  

I'm not one to really express myself through my automobile choice.  I wanted a car to get me from point A to point B, not show the world who I really am.  A Prizm is not a good substitute for a Mustang or a VW Bug.  But it's a perfect car for people who don't care about that stuff.  I am completely happy with mine!
