            I was a dedicated 35mm photographer up until a month ago.  The Canon G1 is now the only camera I bring with me <i>anywhere</i>.  

After copious research and reading reviews, I opted for the G1 over some other cameras in the 3MP range and I am glad I did.  The swivel LCD seemed gimmicky at first, but I find it very helpful when composing shots that I plan to shoot with the remote or timer.  I also like having the remote for triggering the camera on longer exposures as this helps reduce the camera-shake.

The flash hot-shoe is something that I have not had the opportunity to test yet, but knowing that I can extend my system without the cumbersome brackets required by similar digi-cams is a definite plus.  Another thing I haven't used is the Type II compatibility.  In the event that microdrives plummet in price, it's nice to know that I have a camera with which I can use one.

There are a lot of other really great things about this camera...I do most of my shooting in RAW mode.  This is Canon's proprietary "loss-less" compression that is similar to shooting a TIFF but with a lot less space required on the CF card.  The benefit of this is that I can adjust the white-balance and other parameters if necessary when I bring the image to the computer.  And if I am not happy, I can always go back to the RAW image and change it again without losing anything.  The RAW images require about 3-4 MBs of storage.  This means that the included 16mb card will have to be upgraded almost immediately.

I was comparing this camera to the Nikon 880 which I think is also a fine camera.  The price difference was around $120, but by the time you purchase a rechargeable battery and charger (both included with the G1 out of the box), you are pretty close to paying the same money.

I have only a couple dislikes...the first is the shoddy optical viewfinder.  It's pretty useless and you'll be using the LCD for most of your shooting.  Another is the lousy ZoomBrowser software that Canon includes for working with the images.  On the upside, there are quite a few freeware and shareware programs that allow you to work with them more efficiently.  This is one of those things that you'll have to sort out for yourself...

All in all, I can't wait to take this camera on vacation.  The image quality is stunning, even blown up to 8x10 or 11x14, and the camera fits nicely in the palm of my hand.

So quit deciding and go out and buy one!!
