            Note: (this is a copy my review from another site)

This camera was the last result of buying digital cameras and going back and forth to the store to trade for another. I was unsatisified with certain draw backs I just couldn't live with that most digital cameras had, Especially for the money we spend on digital cameras.

For instance. I purchased a fujifilm finepix 6x zoom 3800 camera. I found the macro quality to be excellent, but the camera's lcd screen was HORRIBLE in low light conditions, that also meant I could not take pictures properly inside the house. There were other negatives, but I'll get onto the optio 33L.

The optio 33L is a satisfying camera to own. I feel better buying this camera for 200 dollars less than the fuji. It has everything you need minus the powerful zoom, but I suspect that this camera will become very popular and they will possibly create a clip on zoom or something along those lines.

Its a great beginners camera, and very fun to use and try all the functions.

There are NO draw backs that I've experienced with this camera. In manual focus mode, there is relatively the same shutter lag as any "real" camera and for this I was impressed. Most older model digital cameras have not yet improved on the time it takes to take the picture.

This camera has a very neat OS, and having ONLY the LCD screen is NOT a drawback like I was first worried about. No viewfinder is not a big deal because the lcd so far works great in all conditions.

I have to give this a great review because I'm the pickiest guy in the world, and I have read through several camera reviews, tried out several cameras and this has the best for your buck. I could rave about this camera but I suggest you find a way to try it out and enjoy! 


Problems
There were no problems encountered as of yet. Possibly a silly thing to say is, when you have black and white   red filter and you are taking a picture of someone that is blushing, everything is in black and white except their red cheeks and it looks quite hilarious.

Another possible draw back is, if you have bad vision, due to the size of the lCD screen on the small camera, the text might be hard to read, but I have also never seen a LCD as accurate and clear as this. It takes a great camera to make me happy.
Buying this camera has made me happy and satisfied and I'm very curious to see if there will be any negative reviews, I believe Pentax has created a winner.
