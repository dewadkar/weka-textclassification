            I have owned this camera almost a year and taken hundreds of pictures with it.  The price was right (about $200.00 after rebates) and I wanted a camera with at least 3MP and at least 3X optical zoom.  The digital zoom might as well not even be there...I never use it because it really reduces the quality.  However, the little bit of optical zoom is fine as long as you can get fairly close to your subject. 

Recently I took pictures with a 35mm camera at the same time I used the 720, and the digital pics were far and away of better quality.  I have printed out 8 X 10's on my HP Photosmart printer with absolutely no 'jaggies' (but be sure to use photo paper).

I bought the camera dock and rechargeable batteries, and always carry alkaline AA's just in case.  I have found the batteries actually hold out very well, especially if you use the LCD sparingly and don't zoom and flash constantly (my last trip was over 50 pics without turning off the camera and still had plenty of charge...get a 64 or 128 MB SD card and always use the highest quality setting, you won't regret it).

Practice using different settings for the white balance...I find the cloudy setting generally gives better color although I usually adjust my photos in Photoshop anyway.  Also, I generally use a tripod for absolutely sharp definition...too much movement will generally not give good results with this camera.

The movie mode is not bad if you understand you won't be making TV quality movies, but it is fine for little clips with some sound.  It is nice to set up with the tripod and make a nice 360 degree shot as a movie.
