            I have been wanting a digital camera now for some time now, but I was not really sure what I wanted or even how to use one.  I wanted something easy and that used floppy disk.  When I looked at this digital camera I was hoping I wasn't getting myself into something that was to much work.  I got it home and was using it right after it was charged up.  It was very simple to figure out all the different settings and picture sizes were basically self explanitory.  The zoom works very well.  There is nothing to install on your computer, just put in the floppy and your ready to send the pictures by email, or whatever you choose.  I have even put my pictures online and ordered photo prints and they look very nice.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone that wants nice pictures and easy use.
