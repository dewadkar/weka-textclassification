            Just the other day I got to experience this suv. Even though I owned a 2000 I love the 2001. The engine in this suv is unbelievable. This suv feels like your driving on butter. The handling is supurb. You should buy this car if your looking for a nice handling and with a little extra. If you get a chance i would highly recomend taking it for a spin. Even though I my opinion can not make you buy this suv you should at least try it out. Why not? If your going to spend that much money on an suv you should at least get the best.<br><br>
