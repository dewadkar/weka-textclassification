            My dad had a Volvo and loved it so I decided after totaling my Mercury Tracer on the interstate that I would purchase an older Volvo.  One of my main reasons for purchasing a car made by Volvo was because of their safety record.  Luckily I never had to test my out but my mom unfortunately got the opportunity to test her Volvo out in a wreck.  I strongly believe that if she had not been in the Volvo the wreck would had killed or severly injured.  

I had just had my second child so my mom came up to stay with my 14 month old.  After watching him and driving to the hospital in Birmingham several times I guess she was overtired.  When she left my house she seemed okay. There is a four hour drive between my house and my parents.  Near Greenville she started to fell sleepy so she went to Cracker Barrell to eat a small lunch and a big glass of coffee.  

Back on the road again.  She seemed to get sleepier and sleepier and nothing helped.  About 40 miles from her house she fell asleep at the wheel and left I-65.  A lady driving behind her saw the whole thing.  My mom never knew what was happening until the car went through three trees. 
These were not small trees either.  They were pretty good size pine trees.
It took the wrecker service over three hours to get the mangle Volvo out of the trees.  

The Volvo was a mess and no question it wasn't total.  If you saw pictures of the vehicle you would wonder how someone survived.  It is the inside of the car that will amaze you.  Even though the body of the Volvo took a beating the inside of the Volvo looked like it had been shipped off the factory floor brand new.  

You are probably wondering what happened to my mom.  All I can say is that she had several angels looking over her that day.  She climbed out of the car shaking from fear but not a scratch or a bone broken.  I don't believe she was even sore the next day.  Volvo number feature is safety.

There are several features I love on the Volvo.  Of course I love the fact it is safe.  I believe that is why my mom is here today.  The vehicle is comfortable.  The seats fit to you instead of filling like a foreign object against your body.  The room this vehicle has is unbelievable.  I moved myself from college to my present home in my Volvo.  As far as driving the Volvo is one of the best vehicle on the road.  You can hardly hear any road noise.  If you can check to make sure that your window or door is closed tightly.  

Okay for Volvo downfall and this isn't really Volvo fault.  When cars get old they break down.  All cars do this.  The only problem is that fixing a Volvo can be rather expensive.  I put over $5000 in my Volvo before I sold it.  This was in a 4 year period.  My parents put over $4000 in theirs within a 3 year period.  Despite the expensive repair bills the Volvo is worth every penny because of its safety record.  

Driving the Volvo is like driving on air.  I have not found anything that could compare to the smoothness and noiseless drive.  The car itself is easy to drive and very comfortable.  I drove hours after hours in this car without ever getting a leg cramp or a backache.  Even when I was pregnant with my first child traveling didn't seem to bother me as long as I was riding in the Volvo.  <br><br>
