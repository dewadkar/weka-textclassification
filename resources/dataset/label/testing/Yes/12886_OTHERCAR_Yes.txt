            This is an excellent entry level camera, and worlds ahead of the cameras available just a few years ago.

The first distinguishing feature is the use of the smart media card. This is essentially a tiny floppy disk, you can use multiple smart media cards, and both read and write from them. It is important to note that as shipped there is no smart media card, much like traditional camera don't usually ship with film. As such you can only take a few pictures. So you should plan on purchasing a smart media card at the same time as your camera purchase. Several companies make smart media cards - I purchased a 128m card for about $60. At the highest resolution it will hold approximately 200 pictures.

The next distinguishing feature is the usb autoconnect. As soon as you plug your camera into your computer, pc or mac, via usb it displays like a floppy disk in "my computer" for PC's, or like a hard drive on the desktop for mac users. It is simple to view your files, rename them, copy them, etc. The smart media card is exactly like another drive to the computer, there is no download process required.

The last notable feature is the ability to record up to 60 seconds of video (no sound) as a QuickTime movie. This is no substitute for a camcorder, by any stretch of the imagination. But it is perfect for emailing little clips to your friends.

I have not yet found anything which I dislike about this little camera. I did decide to invest in rechargeable AA batteries instead of the AC power.
