                 I too ordered this car April 21 and am still waiting.  

My husband is the one who first saw this car on the internet and said that we had to have one.  I was a little more cautious and wanted to actually see and touch one before ordering.  Our local dealer finally got one in, and we went to see it, touch it, sit in it.  It was truly a nice car.  It took a couple of weeks before we decided to order one, so he went down to the dealer, plunked down $1000. and were told that it would be 5 to 7 months.  That was agreeable.  It has almost been 7 months, and I am still #8 on the list waiting to be scheduled for a build date.  That means that it will be almost a year from my order date before I will get this car.  I am ready to buy another car but my husband will not let this car go.  I hope that it meets all his expectations when we finally do get it.  I have been hearing lately that there have been some problems cropping up, but what can you expect with a first year car??  
     
     This car is very comfortable and functional.  I had a minivan, and I liked having the space in the rear, and this car has plenty of that.  The creature comforts are better than some of the other more expensive cars that we have test driven, and believe me, we have driven quite a few in the last 7 months!
     
     We have not driven this vehicle yet.  I have read numerous quotes from other owners, and I have only heard 1 negative comment.  
     
     I think that everyone would enjoy this car, but I don't know if a person with a hot temper could stand the wait. My dealer is always nice when I do call or stop by, which is often.  
      
     I don't know how much longer I will hold out.  Maybe I should go test drive one of those Lexus Sports Utility Vehicles..........  <br><br>
