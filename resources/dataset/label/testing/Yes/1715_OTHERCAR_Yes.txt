            I've had my Honda CR-V for exactly three years now. I wanted to buy a SUV, looked at the Rav-4 but being that my partner and I are both over six feet , we felt a bit cramped. We heard that Honda was coming out with a SUV so we waited 3 months. We are very saisfied with our Honda, as I said my car is three years old, and I have had no problems with it so far. I average between 20-25 mpg. Once a month I take the car on a 600 mile road trip. The car performs real well. I travel from New York to ROchester in the winter and always feel safe on the road with the 4 wheel drive. My only complaint about the car is I wish it had more power. Sometimes I feel like its a struggle to get uphill. The pros definitly outway the cons with this car.<br><br>
