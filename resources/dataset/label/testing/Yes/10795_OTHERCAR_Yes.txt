            Well I finally got my Cadillac of trucks.  This baby not only looks good, but it rides like a dream, pulls like a semi and is more comfortable than a luxury car.  We have a 27' boat that weighs over 7,000 pounds and our new GMC yanks it out of the water without even a hesitation.  I compared it to the new Excursion and I think that my GMC sounds and feels more solid and the internal components of the GMC are just made better.  I have leather interior in mine and the quality is outstanding.  One thing I dont really like is the design of the passenger seat.  It curves out alittle too much in the small of my back.<br><br>
