            I have a LS 2wd shortbed 5.3,auto,3.73 positraction rear.While some may not call this a truck as much as a sport vehicle I call it a truck.This is my 3rd new truck in 10 years and if GM polled me on what I wanted in a truck this is it.This unit is built for me.There were some bugs that go along with a first year run but I accept this.More of  minor nuiscences than problems.Gas mileage is 15 in town 21 highway.Performance from a dead stop is pretty hot for a stock truck.The ride is a little harsh from the stiffer suspension but has softened some since new.I compare driving this to a late 80's Z28.The cabin is quiet and comfortable.I don't care for DRL's and the paint (Indigo Blue) is a little thick orange peel-like for me and somewhat of a dull shine.I recommend this to anyone considering a new truck.<br><br>
