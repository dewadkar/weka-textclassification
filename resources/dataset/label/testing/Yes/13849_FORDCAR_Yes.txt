            I bought my 98 Contour in June of 1999.  It has the 2.0 4 cyl. Vtec engine and a 4 speed automatic transmission. The gear shift has an over-drive switch on it making it handy when you need a little extra pep passing or going up steep hills. This engine has 16 valves, dual overhead cam and delivers around 130 horses.  I'm always hesitant on the four cylinder cars, but this one has some attitude.  I took the car out for a test drive and she holds her own in merging traffic.  I was amazed with the pep that this car had.

<b><i>European Design &amp; Handling</i></b>

The 98 Contour was designed by the Ford European development team. It is modeled after its cousin, the Mondeo.  When you drive this car, you instantly notice some of the European features in it.  Its handling is Grade A.  Its the best handling mid-size car that I have driven.  It would have been nicer to have the optional 2.5 V-6 duratec with 170 horses under the hood, but for the money, the 2.0 does just fine. I can drive the contour up in to the 85 and 90 mph range and it drives just fine.  The car starts to get a  little shaky around the 95 mph range.

<b><i>Maintenance</i></b>

Maintenance on the Contour is fairly simple.  When using Ford Motorcraft 5W-30 oil and a Motorcraft oil filter, the Contour can go for 5,000 miles in between oil changes.  This is the Manufacturer recommendation.  Also the grease fittings are sealed on the Contour, so you don't have to worry about the guy at the Oil Change station forgetting to lube the chassis.  I usually do all routine maintenance on my vehicles, but the Contour sits awfully low to the ground making it very tedious changing the oil. I don't like to jack the car up just to change the oil, so I usually take it to the oil express and have them change it.  The oil filter is in a hard to reach place and not a very good one at that.  It is right above the  manifold and when you change the oil, there is no way of missing it.  So for a few days, it smells like your car is burning oil.  I think this was bad engineering on Ford's part.  

<b><i>Interior and Room Space</i></b>

The biggest drawbacks with the Contour is that for a four door vehicle, back leg room space is very tight.  This is a major setback for this car and this is where other cars like the Chevy Malibu are a good choice if you have people riding in the back frequently.  Trust me, you will be stopping at several and I mean several rest stops on a long trip.  For kids, it is fine, but for adults, it is a little too tight.  The interior trim is ok, nothing spectacular.  I do like the cruise control buttons being on the steering wheel.  I like this design a whole lot better than putting the cruise control button on the windshield wiper lever.  Just about all of the power buttons are in good places.  I like the way Ford designed several buttons to have a different feel to them.  This helps when you are driving so you can keep your eyes on the road and not have to worry with fumbling with the buttons trying to find the right one.

<b><i>Fuel Economy</i></b>

I think the Contour is rated to 23 mpg City and 31 mpg Highway.  I usually average the 23 mpg.  This is mediocre for a four cylinder car, but its better than what I was used to.  I had a 96 Chevy Blazer which averaged around at the most 15 mpg.

<b><i>Summary</i></b>

Overall, the Contour is a nice car.  The exterior looks nice with its European design, but the cockpit is where Ford fell short.  The back seat space is awful for any adult.  It is just too tight.  I was shocked being the Contour is a foor door car, but It doesn't have much more leg space than the Mustang.  As far as performance, I think the Contour has plenty of pep to merge with traffic and to pass.  It is not a powerhouse by no means.  If you want something with a lot of power, I suggest the Contour SVT or perhaps even a Mustang Cobra.  But for the money, I spent, it does just fine.<br><br>
