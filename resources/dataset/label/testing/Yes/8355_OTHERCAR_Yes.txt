            Just recently got the 350 for  $46 on an Egghead auction,
and see these cameras for sale elsewhere.  I don't have much
experience with digital cameras, but have used a $700 Toshiba.
 Camera is made in China, the quality of the 40 or 50 photos
that I've taken so far varies somewhat.  A lot depends on the
lighting.  The included software installed easily but is not
very intuitive.  The camera connects to your pc with a 9-pin
serial cable. They recommend using the AC adaptor when transferring
photos because of the power drain, in order to increase the
battery life.  The battery is a LS123, about $8 to $10.
 As expected, the camera has a cheap look and feel, but is light
and small.   Operation is pretty easy, the manual explains the
functions on the small LCD display pretty well.   It takes about
13 seconds for the camera to process a shot until it is ready
to take the next picture.  No preview screen.  Camera is turned on
by flipping up the flash flap.  It automatically powers down after
2 minutes of inactivity.
  Overall,  ok for a starter camera, for kids, or to  experience
digital cameras.
