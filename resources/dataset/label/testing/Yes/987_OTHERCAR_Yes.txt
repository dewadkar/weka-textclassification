            Introduction:
I have owned the Toyota Matrix 2003 XR for about 4-5 months now and I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  The vehicle has a blend of features that make it unique.  For example, the car can be considered half-SUV or it can just be called a very stylish station wagon.

Competition:
Similar vehicles intended to compete with the Toyota Matrix are the Pontiac Vibe and Dodge's PT Cruiser.

Research:
The most important thing about purchasing a car is how much research you do.  I checked out multiple websites as well as car dealerships to find out the features and prices in order to see how much the car is really worth. The Toyota Matrix is actually based on the award-winning Toyota Corolla. The car has 3 different basic models: The basic model, XR, and XRS.  The basic model is the cheapest, and starts at around $15,000.  I quickly discovered that the basic model does not initially include basic features such as powered mirrors or windows.  Therefore, I immediately took a look at the XR.  The XR comes with all the needed basic features that you would see in any other reasonably priced car: power windows, power locking doors, air conditioning.

Test Drive:
I test-drove the Toyota Matrix two times.  The first time, the engine seemed a bit noisier than other cars I have driven.  The second time on a different car, the engine was quieter.  It is important to test drive multiple times until you find one that you like and to find out what sounds may be unusual or normal.  When stepping on the gas pedal, you will notice that the engine sounds much lower. This appeals to the younger adults which makes the car sound powerful.  

Buying:
When I went to buy the car, I stopped by Melody Toyota.  This was where I bought the car.  The first thing I noticed about their cars is they directly sell their cars for retail price with low dealer markup.  The salesman was very helpful and supportive in the process.  He showed us the car inside out.  We were able to get an incredible deal on the car.  We got the car for about $16,500 before tax.  That was below the dealer's invoice price!  One of the important things to know when buying a car is to keep your options open.  Don't be afraid to walk out if the price is not low enough for you.

Main Features:
Power Door Locks
Power Windows
Power Mirrors
Alloy Wheels
Fog Lights
4 Speakers/with CD/AM/FM Player

Operation:
Upon opening the driver's door of the car, I noticed the unique material of the seating.  It looked and felt different than the conventional cloth or leather seats.  The seats were comprised of a black cloth covered with a nylon net.  Upon sitting in the seat, the seat felt very comfortable and soft.  The nylon gave a firm grip feel of the seat.  Although the car looks very small on the outside, the inside was very roomy for both the front and back seat passengers.  When looking at the instrument panel, it lights up with a red glow that looks very nice.  There are silver linings on the instrument panel which give a very stylish look that matches well with the interior.  The dashboard controls in the middle have very large buttons and are easy to access.  The CD/AM/FM player had great sound.  There was no distortion at high sound levels.  There is also a 115v outlet which is great for devices such as cell-phone chargers.  The air conditioner and heater work well.  Upon turning on the engine, you will immediately hear a low rumble of the engine.  When driving the car, the car was vey responsive.  When turning the wheel an inch or two, the car was very responsive.  This car has good acceleration and handles very well on both the city and highway.  With an automatic transmission, the car had very smooth shifts in the city at around 10-40mph.  On the freeway, the car did have an unusually high torque when shifting at around 50mph.  The brakes had a very responsive and solid feel which could stop the car easily.  The trunk of the car has a spacious flat area which can be covered with a nylon cover to prevent people from peeking in through the window.

Summary:
As you know, I am still very happy with my purchase.  There are several nice things about the car.  First, the seats are made of cloth covered with a nylon net to give it a "sporty" look and which is comfortable.  What is also amazing about the car is that both of the back seats can be folded down separately to get more space.  I was able to fit as much stuff in the car as with a Toyota Sienna.
