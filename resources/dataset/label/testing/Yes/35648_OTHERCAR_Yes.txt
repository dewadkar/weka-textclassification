            This is the first American car I've owned since 1982.  The main selling point was that Dodge made an AWD version of their van, and very few others made an AWD van.

I live in Rochester, NY, and I wanted something that was good in snow.  After having a 4WD Suzuki Sidekick, I didn't want to give up the 4WD on my new vehicle.  I needed a van (kids, trips), so I was somewhat limited to my choice.

So far I really like the car.  I've had it a little over 1 year now, and it drives real nice (but then again, remember I've upgraded from a Sidekick which is a fun tin can on wheels!).

I was a bit worried that AWD wouldn't be as good in snow as 4WD, but I haven't noticed a difference.   I've driven in a lot of snow, and it's great!   Plus the antilock brakes, which I didn't have before, are a boon for the snow.

A couple problems so far:  The passenger side sliding door didn't latch properly, and rattled while driving.  I had to have that fixed.   I also had to replace a shock already because it had some sort of leak and was contributing to a bouncy).

I wish the back seats were lighter, so they could be more easily removed.  The Honda minivan (and one other out there) has seats that fold down into the floor.  Not sure how that really works.  It would be nice if Dodge could mimic something along those lines.

Gas mileage is pretty poor.  Around town I get 18mpg or so, and maybe 23mpg on highway.  I assume the AWD eats up some of the gas (?), since the other Caravans with the 3.0L V6 claim higher mileage.


8/18/03 Update: Recently I've had several transmission related problems.  About a year ago the speed sensor went bad, and the car wouldn't shift (but &lt; $100 to repair).  A month ago, I thought the same thing happened, but I had to get a new valve body ($550).  Last week, the car wouldn't shift again (while I was on vacation!), and luckily I found a dealer in the area.  The speed sensor went again, and was replaced again.
