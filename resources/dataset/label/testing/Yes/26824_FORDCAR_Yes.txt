                 Well my experience with the 1999 ford expedition has been a very good one to date.  This truck is a pleasure to ride, it has a very large ground clearance and a powerful V8 with an ability to tow a house (not actually, but it comes close) I fist drove this truck about 9 months ago and instantly liked the enormous feel and height that i had over all the other little cars.  The truck just feels so safe and secure, and that was something i was looking for in a SUV.  The truck model which i have the pleasure of driving is the XLT with lots of options like Leather, power everything, 4 wheel drive ,CD radio along with countless other options.  The truck is a solid well built machine capable of handling rain snow sleet rain and floods with ease. It also has a lot of style for a SUV, its clean and well built inside and out with numerous advantages over many of its counterparts. For one the Lincoln Navigator, now folks lets not be fooled, the navigator and Expedition are the SAME EXACT TRUCK, made by the same company (Ford makes Lincoln) except you will pay anywhere from 3 to 7 thousand more for the Navigator because it has a lot of useless Luxury Items. Sorry I don't believe in LUXURY SUV's. Stick with the expedition
     There is really only one thing I can complain about....and that is the gas mileage. Anywhere from 8-12 MPG is a little outrageous with gas prices as high as they are today. But I still love this truck and would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
