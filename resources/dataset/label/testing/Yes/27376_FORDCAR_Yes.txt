            We just purchased a new 2001 Ford F150 SuperCrew and we love it!  It has plenty of room inside for our family of 5.  There are four full size doors and plenty of room for 6 average size adults.  We traded a 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix for the truck and I was amazed at all the room we now have for us, the kids and all their paraphenelia.  

With all that said, the truck has a small but functional 4 foot bed that is perfect for someone who doesn't really need a full size bed to haul big loads with.  The bed is plenty big enough for us to use for camping and hauling furniture or bikes.  The truck has plenty of power and the 4WD comes in handy for these snowy Michigan days.  I have never had a 4WD vehicle, and it is so easy to use, there is a switch on the dash and you flip it to 4WD and away you go.  

My husband had been wanting a truck for awhile, and I was against it because of the kids, and wanting to be sure that we have enough room, but I fell in love with this truck when we test drove it.  I highly recommend this vehicle to those who are looking for a powerful yet functional vehicle.  Happy Driving<br><br>
