            I was a Honda person, having owned several of them in a period of thirteen years.  My latest were Preludes, cars which were a delight to drive over hills and around curvy country roads.  When I visited my daughter in the mountains of Washington, I rode in and drove her Subaru GL, and said, &quot;Never would I own a Subaru!&quot;  

Then I moved to those mountains.  My driveway in winter was a bobsled course, and my new front wheel drive car could not, even with studs,  navigate it without chains.  I began to look for a four wheel drive vehicle, but was dissatisfied with all I tried.  When I stopped at the Subaru dealer to look at another car he also sold, he persuaded me to &quot;at least take a little spin&quot; in the new 1990 Legacy wagon, &quot;a whole different kind of Subaru&quot; with all-the-time all-wheel drive.

After I had put 120 thousand miles on that Legacy, my daughter bought it and drove it for three years. After I had driven 92 thousand miles in my next car, a 1993 Legacy wagon, she sold hers (which is still in use) and took the '93.  I now have 93 thousand miles my '97 Outback Limited and will soon be shopping for another car.  What kind of car will it be? What do you think?<br><br>
