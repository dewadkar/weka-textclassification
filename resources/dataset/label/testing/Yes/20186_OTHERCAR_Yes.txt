            My family has had two suburbans throughout our time.  The first one was a '75 model that lasted almost 20 years.  It was still running well when we sold it. But now we have a '95 model, and it is damn nice.  It has one of the smoothest rides of any SUV and is much roomier than any of them.  Most SUVs are just cars that are raised.  But the Suburban is huge.  It can comfortably fit 8 people and a lot of luggage.  Mini-vans are not good family cars.  This is the car for a big family.  My brother calls it the assault vehicle.  When you're on the road, you own it.  You can crush the competition in this baby.  It's great in the ice and snow also.  And even if you do get into an accident, nothing happens to this hunk of steel.  My mother was hit from the back once.  While the other car wasn't looking to nice, the Suburban didn't even have a scratch.  What a car!<br><br>
