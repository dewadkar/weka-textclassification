            I decided to try out one of these digital cameras after seeing the results my doctor had with his camera. I bought the BRIOD-100 at BestBuys for $200 and also purchased a 32Mb SmartMedia card, which allows me to take 36 pictures in the SHQ (Uncompressed) mode,or 99 in HQ (Compressed)mode. The 8Mb that came with the camera only allowed 24 pictures in HQ mode and although they are not too bad, I rather go for the higher resolution. The Battery that comes with the camera is Olympus own type of power cell, which is a 3 Volt Lithium encase in plastic as a module and cost, about $10. You can also use 2 regular AA batteries. I tried the rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries, but found that they are miserably slow at getting the flash up to speed since they are only putting out 2.4 volts, 1.2 each battery, at full charge and this camera works best on a 3 Volt current, so I opted for Alkaline Batteries, which are cheaper. What I really like about this camera is the way it uses the available light to give you the best possible picture. I even gone as far as to take a picture in total darkness, using the flash, and got a good picture! This is a great camera for anyone who wants to simply take pictures and enjoy them. It's small enough to go any where and big enough to bring home the memories. Very impressive indeed. Use your own Photo Editing program, I suggest PantShop Pro7 or PhotoImpact6, to really add snap to your shots. Good Luck and Enjoy!
