            My mom bought a Land Cruiser last year and it is the best car that the family has owned.  The Land Cruiser was great for a larger family and for carpool.  It is very spacious and the seats are more than comfortable.  The stereo system was exceptional.  I had a lot of fun driving it around. It is such a smooth ride and the pick up is great.  The looks of the Land Cruiser turns many heads.  I know that it did for us.  The Land Cruiser has great gas mileage.  It does cost a good penny to fill it up, but you can ride a long way.  Going on trips was so much fun in such a roomy car.  The seats did not make your butt hurt.  You could fall asleep and not wake up on trips until you got to where you were going.  The Land Cruisers, or our Land Cruiser, was a great car.  We got our moneys worth.  There has been no problems with the it.  I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a big vehicle.  You will not regret it.<br><br>
