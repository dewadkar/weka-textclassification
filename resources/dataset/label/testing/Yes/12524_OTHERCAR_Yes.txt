            I tried several cameras and read many reviews before buying this one from dolivertonn on Ebay.  First, I must comment about buying cameras on Ebay -- BE CAREFUL!!!  dolivertonn was the only honest seller I encountered in a two-month period.  All the other sellers either had no actual product to sell, sent in rebate forms and collected these themselves, sent out used products, or sent out refurbished products.  I also had an eye opener with respect to cameras advertised in the nationally published magazines.  A few of them offered insanely low prices, only I discovered that was because they were overseas models that came with no warranty, software, box, etc.  The overseas model also took 6 weeks+ to deliver.

I have liked every Sony digital camera I have tried, including an old Mavica, DSC-V1, DSC-P72, and this one.  The swivel body on the DSC-F717 is very nice in that you can hold the camera in a position that is more natural for you (i.e. don't have to hold the camera straight-on like you would with a conventional camera).  It takes such incredible photos that I've been accused of manipulating them digitally.  No one believes they look like that directly from the camera!!!  I will agree this is a very bulky camera, but then again it's not so small that you can't find a place to hold it like with the DSC-V1.  Everything about the F717 reeks quality.  I had to (at my option) buy a lot of the accessories offered for it from Ebay (with no problems and huge savings on these items).  The wide angle lens from Sony is simply amazing.  The hood is great for isolating unwanted glare from the flash, though you must use an external flash when using the hood.  Memory sticks are quite inexpensive now, so get at least 256MB.  One really nice feature with the Sony cameras is that all recent models (those within the last year) are USB 2.0 compatible.  I noticed most other manufacturers are still using USB 1.0 compatibility, including the digital Rebel from Canon, which really surprised me.  For those of you who don't understand this, when you download the camera to your computer, USB 2.0 is literally 40 times faster than USB 1.0.  When you have taken over 100 photos in one session, you don't necessarily want to wait all day for them to transfer.

Overall, I have no complaints about this camera.  I bought an extra battery from thebattery on Ebay for $23, but with an average battery life of 3 hours, you probably won't need one unless travelling.  I would probably recommend a smaller camera for general sight-seeing, just because this camera is so darn bulky.  Quality-wise, you can't go wrong with the DSC-F717, however.  

I'm anxious to try out the DSC-F828 when it is finally released.
