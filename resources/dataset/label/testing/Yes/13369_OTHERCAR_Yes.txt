              When Acura decided to discontinue the manufacturing of Legends in 1993, I was at a loss for words. How could the executives at Acura be so misled? By deciding to create the TL,CL, and RL models we see today, they were replacing one of the greatest luxury cars this world has ever seen. They were the Boston Red Sox selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees under the impression that they were only losing a quality starting pitcher. For those who don't know, ever since that disasterous trade in the early 1900s, Boston has never won the World Series. I would not be surprised if a fate of the same magnitude awaits Acura for this travesty.
  I own a black 1993 Legend Sedan. I bought it for roughly under 45,000 and I feel as if I came away with a steal. When any normal human being first catches a glimpse of this remarkable car, the first thing they would notice is the body itself. One can tell that it is a luxury car but there is a noticeable difference in the makeup that also gives the Legend a sporty look. But trust me when I say that in this case, looks are not deceiving. Running smooth like a summer breeze, there is a considerable amount of power from the torque and 200 horses all compiled into a strong but steady V-6 engine. It handles with the greatest amount of ease and confidence. During these 6+ years of usage, I came across literally hundreds of near accidents/collisions of which I avoided ALL of them due to the unique combination of power, anti-lock abs, and overall outstanding aerodynamic features the Legend possesses. Drag racing? Not a problem with the unique 4 gear automatic shift in which leaving the gear in neutral while reving the engine to about 2500 rpm can make the most intimidating opponents choke on your exhaust.
  The minor maintenance requirements are definitely worth the reliability and quality the Legend gives the driver in return. I like to describe my Legend as truly a luxury sports car reminiscent of BMW's M cars and Lexus' GS models. There are rumors of a comeback but until then, the irony of its name is more than appropriate. A Legend.<br><br>
