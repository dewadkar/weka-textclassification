            A car tells a lot about a person, and I can proudly say that my Cabrio suits me just fine.  I love the look, the drive, and the feel of my '99 VW.  

I knew I wanted to get a convertible, but I was concerned about the quality of the convertible top.  The Cabrio top feels very durable and solid and the rollbar gives it security.  A slight drawback to the convertible top is the noise that can be heard through it.  Not a problem really, just crank the radio!  

With over 11,000 miles in less than 7 months, I've experienced no problems with the way the car runs.  Driving it is very comfortable. I particularly like the seat that raises and lowers.  Unfortunately, the cupholders are practically useless, as they only fit small cups or 8 ounce cans.  The dashboard looks very spunky at night with blue and red lights (everyone comments).

The only &quot;problem&quot; I've found with my new love, is when it rains, the water lands right on the outer corner of the front driver and passenger seats.  Upon initially opening the door, quite a bit of water drips inside.

Otherwise, LOVE IT!     <br><br>
