             I drive a lot of rental cars because I travel for work.  This time I wound up with a Ford Focus SE.  After only driving this car for two days, I definitely have some positive things to say about this car.  First, I'm surprised at the solid and responsive feel of the steering.  If there's any sort of power steering on this car, the engineers did a good job keeping the boost low.  Compared to a Mazda 626, the steering effort is much higher at lower speeds.  Naturally, this effort decreases as you speed up.  At any speed though, the feeling is not "vague" or "numb" like most American cars.  It's almost the same feeling as driving the BMW hatchback, except the illusion becomes ruined once you look down at the dash or the rest of the interior.

Speaking of interior, the controls don't have the look or feel of something like the Honda Civic, but the layout is simple and the interior is roomy and quiet.  To be more specific, the feel of the controls are an improvement over other American cars, but they just haven't reached the level of refinement found in a German or Japanese car.  In terms of the interior noise when you're driving, the first time I was on the freeway,  I kept wondering why everyone was driving so slow.  Then I realized I was going 90 and didn't even know it.  I'm not saying the interior of this car is as quiet as that in a Lexus, but it's a lot more quiet than a Saturn or even the Mazda 626 mentioned above.  I also like the "pull-out" style door handles instead of the "flip-up" handles normally found on a car in this price range.

Besides the fact that this car needs a little more low-end torque and a slightly stiffer suspension, the only other issues I can think of are pretty trivial.  The storage area in the center armrest isn't big enough to store anything.  The cupholders are a bit of a reach.  The driver's seat has adjustments to move the seat up and down vertically; however, the control to do this is a dial located at the front of the seat that is somewhat difficult to turn because of the way you have to reach for it once you are sitting.  It's almost easier to get out of the car and do the adjustment.  

If you're looking for a good commuter car or live in an area where parking spaces are tight, give the Ford Focus a test drive.  You'll probably be surprised at how good it feels.
