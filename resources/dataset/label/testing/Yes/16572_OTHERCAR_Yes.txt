            Of all the cars I have driven, this car is the only one that I never grew tired off driving and the one that I still wish I was driving. I know a lot of people favor the new 3 series, but I feel that this one is the true BMW, the newer ones are too refined. Don't get me wrong, I love the new 3 series; they are safer, quieter, and probably minimally better in every objective driving category, but this BMW is the one that typifies the brand for me.

TECHNICAL

It has a wonderfully torquey inline 6 that always has power in reserve, no matter where the rev needle is. All the BMW hallmarks apply; extremely rigid body, a suspension that is just firm enough to unleash amazing handling but with enough cushiness to be comfortable, strong engine pulling power from anywhere on the wide torque band, good gas mileage, long durations between maintenance. The most amazing and pleasureable aspect of the 328 with sports package is not the power of the engine or the great brakes, but the unbelievable handling ability of the car. I have whipped this car around 90 degree right hand turns going 35-40 miles an hour (I don't usually do this but I wanted to illustrate my point) without even a tire squeal. That and all the other amazing things the suspension can do, make me so confident in the absolute tossability of this wonderful sporty car.

NEGATIVES

The interior is very plain, functional and sometimes even seems a little cheap. This doesn't bother me too much but I know a lot of people find BMW's interior's lacking. I prefer to focus my attention on the driving. The standard stereo is pretty awful with bad sound reproduction quality and the layout and use of the semi-climate control system is completely confusing. However, once again, this car is for driving and the newer 3 series BMW has tried to remedy these issues. The only other worry for me is long term reliability since I have heard conflicting reports from various sources in relation to BMW. The cars are definitely improved in the short run, hopefully this will remain true for 10+ years. I have never had any problems with my new and 3 year old bimmers.

SUBJECTIVE THOUGHTS

Ahhhh, the little things that I love about this car; the metallic snick/clack of the door unlocking, the gutsy ignition start-up note, the tight underboosted power steering, the way everything in the car has such solidity and weight to it. Most cars are like appliances with this option and this cool feature that let the car do everything for you. However, BMW's are machines that try so hard to involve you in the pleasurable experience of driving them. I love starting the engine and feeling the engine spring to life through the steering wheel and accelerator pedal, and how that carries through to communicating at all times exactly what the car is doing and where its limits are. You can actually feel the tires gripping the road and the lines and elements of the road.

I know some people think I've gone crazy, that this is only car but I feel this way because of the other luxury cars I have driven since. They were just cars, they strove to isolate the driver and passengers from the road in luxury, and I gleaned very little driving enjoyment from them. It was more like &quot;wow, what great technology, I barely feel like I'm in a car going 70&quot;. If that floats your boat, great, there are some great luxury cars out there, but I want the car with the mechanical turbine of a soul. 

Sorry for waxing poetic, but I truly feel this way about these marvelous cars and judging by BMW's increasing sales I would say that more people are enjoying these cars for there amazing attributes. I enjoy driving other cars made by other manufacturers but if I'm looking for pure driving enjoyment, BMW is for me! Happy motoring everyone.<br><br>
