                I have a 1999 Catera (Leased) that I feel is a fine car. Sure I had a couple of problems( did you ever buy a new car that didn't,) but they were resolved except for what I think is excessive wind noise that they have not been able to correct.A problem with the radio that was corrected.
   The rear headrests interfered with the rear vision of the short person in the family and were removed to the storage area in the trunk. I like the fact you are not without transportation due to Cadillac furnishing a rental car when your car is in the shop. A fact I notice the people having problems fail to mention and the roadside service, if needed. The car is roomy,,lots of pickup,seats comfortable, fun to drive and the interior good. My Catera has all of the bells and whistles, more than I need.I would recommend the car.
  I notice some people are having excessive problems with the Catera and I feel for them but that Has not been my experience. I might add that in our household we have had over 40 new cars, 90% GM,including the first airbag car by GM in 1973.When my lease is up in 2001 I will give the Catera serious consideration. Part of my family likes the new Aurora so we will see what happens in 2001.We already have an Oldsmobile. <br><br>
