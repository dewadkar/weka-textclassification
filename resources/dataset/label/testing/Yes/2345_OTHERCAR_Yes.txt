            A number of months ago I began to consider the prospect of my daughter living and working in Israel. Along with that prospect, I began to dread the thought that she would probably take a couple rolls a week of 35 MM film with her Olympus pocket zoom camera. When I did the math, I realized that I would be crazy not to consider a digital camera. One of my friends had accidentally stumbled upon the PDR-M4. He could not say enough about it. Once I tried it, I was hooked. This is an excellent camera. Wonderful ease of use. Great resolution. I cannot say enough good things about it. We spent 17 days traveling in England and Israel, and every day would download the pictures down to her notebook via the USB port. The downloading was almost instantaneous. Then we would have the later day equivalent of a magic lantern shown. Rarely did we get a bad shot, and then the excellent software that came with it allowed us to crop the images and get some benefit. The only downside is that it doesn't have a powerful zoom. Then it would be a killer product.<br><br>
