I had a 1993 Dakota and it was time, I thought, for a new truck. I tried the three common North American Trucks and I found: Dodge Ram was macho but was not finished as well as the other two. The Chevy was finshed very nicely but for the sound system I was told I'd have to choose between the cassette deck or a one player CD. The Chevy has a very conservative look. The Ford gave me a pleasant surprise. I bought a black flair side XLT, I loved that new look of the Fords.  The option package for the XLT was good, power windows, keyless entry, air, etc. as well as a great sound system with a 6 pack CD and cassette deck. Because the Ford is a heavier truck I found winter driving felt sooooo much safer than with my Dakota(they are both 4X4s). In the worst conditions where there is heavy slush and just. narrow tracks to drive in the Ford could pull out and pass with confidence and not give the drive the fear of losing control. I scored it a 4 because I'm sure it could be even better but I'm confident that no one would be unhappy with this truck. i've driven it about 16000 miles now and the Ford service has been good.  For a carI have a Mazda MIllenia S which is a more expensive vehicle and very well engineered but I don't get a portion of the complements that I get from my F150.
