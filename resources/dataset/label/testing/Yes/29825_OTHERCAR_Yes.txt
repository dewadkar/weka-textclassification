             I did not buy this car brand new, but close though, with only 6,000 miles on it. I've had this car for 3 years. This is a great car. I have had no problem with it at all. I have always changed my oil every 3000 miles, and the only other time I had to bring it in was for the 30,000 miles tune up. I haven't had to change my brakes during these 3 years. Mine was the regular sedan, not the SLI, 5 speed manual. It has power steering, not like the Geo Metros. It runs smooth and has a decent acceleration. The original radio from the car has a better sound than the CD-radio that I put in.
 At one time, I was driving about 65 mph and my rear left tire blew on me. Luckily, I was able to just pump the brake and decrease the car speed little by little and bring the car to a halt. During the whole incident, my wife and my baby in the back seat hardly noticed what actually happened. I really thought it would end up a lot worse if I were driving another car.
  The only complain about this car, is that not too many people know about this car. It is not on the most wanted list. It might be hard to sell this car at its value. Also because the exterior look has practically been the same since 1994 that I noticed(may be even before that). Another thing is about the room inside the car. If you are a tall person, this car is too small for you.
  Let me stress one more thing, it is great on gas!
