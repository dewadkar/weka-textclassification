            When FORD introduced the Excursion into the highly competitive SUV market it was not trying to make a Suburban wanna-be, it was creating a SUV Titan!

FORD's Excursion is the largest SUV in the industry today.  It has ample seating for 9 adults AND their luggage with 48 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the third seat.

Available 2WD and 4WD and 3 different engines, one of which is the 7.3L V8 turbo diesel!!!  Now what other company can come close to that?

This truck can handle any task you ask of it except park in a standard garage.

Even though this truck is nearly 19 ft. long it has a nice ride. This, due to it's 137 in. wheel base. It is built on a Superduty chassis and comes in an XLT and Limited model for now.  You can get all the bells and whistles with this baby.

This is a truck for somebody pulling a nice size boat, horses or a house.  :)   Living in the north, the mountains or a large family.  Why is everybody against it's size?  Once you drive a SUV for awhile you want bigger and better!

If you are considering this truck and plan on a visit to a Ford store, my advice to you, being in Sales at one time is this:  Find somebody who is a TRUCK salesperson and knows their FORD's.  Sales people come and go, if you need to know answers to questions find the right person.

Finally, remember this: Who has the longest lasting trucks in the market?  If Dodge, or Chevy came out with this one I'd say no-way, but we all know.....

FORD TRUCKS BUILT TOUGH!!<br><br>
