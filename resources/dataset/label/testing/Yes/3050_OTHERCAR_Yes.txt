            This review is on the 2002 S10 ZR5 Crew cab.  This truck is a very beautiful, well made truck, and has everything one could ask for in a vehicle.  The interior is the best I have seen in a vehicle.  Much more comfortable than a Cadillac.  The seats are high-back, bucket seats and are so easy on the back you could fall asleep driving.  Mine has manual adjustment and manual lumbar support which I enjoy much more than the power seats.  The steering wheel is leather wrapped, all control buttons are in easy reach of the driver.  The overhead console makes life a lot easier with four individual, swivel map lights, two storage bins, and a garage door opener compartment, along with a digital compass and outside temp gauge.  There are plenty of lights inside the truck to help you see at night, a dome light, floor lights, and under the dash lights.  The 4X4 instatrac buttons are easy to use and the cd/cassette player with RDS is a blast.  It has 6 good size speakers and the radio has auto tone and auto volume.  The truck has a middle console for storage of cd's, and various other items, two bins in one, a non-slip holder on the floor, and door drink holders.  It comes equip with day running lights and automatic lights that come on when dark outside.  You have a dome over ride button that can turn the head lights and running lights off when you want some privacy.  It has intermitten wipers, cruise control, and passive security that make it well worth the money you pay.  The four doors makes it much easier to carry passengers and can carry 5 adults with no problem in room.  The sliding back glass and deep tinted windows add to the style of the truck.  The ZR5 appearance package adds a bedliner, rails, roof rack, and step bars, along with ZR5 decals.  All ZR5's come with 4X4, 4.3 liter Vortec V6 rated at 190 horse power with 250 pounds of torque.  The ZR5 also comes with a bigger payload, trailering weight, and power than the other S10's.  Mine came with heated, oversize mirrors to defrost ice and snow, four wheel disc ABS, 235/75r15 Wrangler tires, a larger drive shaft, and a stiffer suspension.  The truck is the best I have ever seen, I get all kinds of looks when driving down the road.  If you are to buy a truck for show or commute, this is the one, however, I paid almost $30,000 for it and would not dare take it into the woods to scratch it up.  I know it would do just fine, but why ruin a good looking truck?  The gas mileage is the only con I have noted so far.  It has a 19.0 gal fuel tank, and is rated at 15/20 on gas mileage.  This is do to the big engine and low gear axel.  The truck has a ton of power and will get up and go real quick in traffic, but will not sit there and spin the tires as you take off.  Mine is an Onyx black and is very hard to keep clean, but looks much better than the lighter colored trucks.  If you are considering buying and S10, please check out Chevy's website at www.chevy.com/s10.
