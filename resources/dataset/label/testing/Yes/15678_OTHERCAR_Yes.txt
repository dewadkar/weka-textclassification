                   It's no surprise that the new looks of the 2001 C-class are taken from its superior, the S-class. The 2001 C-class has transformed from a former 'boxier' look and V4 engine to S-class exterior styling, high-end luxury interior, and V6 engine. The best part of it is that the price of the new C-class has not changed much from the 1999, or the 2000 models. 

Exterior
      
      Buying a Mercedes means buying that German "solidness" along with it. This car passes the "slam the door" test unlike some Japanese cars which tend to feel light and cheap. The Exterior of the C-class literally looks like a mini S-class. It looks more sportier and aerodynamic than its predecessor without looking smaller. I love the headlights that are taken from the 2000 S-class which are curvy and attractive. However, Xenon headlights are $1500 CAD extra. This car definitely turns heads! We have the C240 in Silver, which is supposed to be Mercedes most popular color. In terms of the paintjob, it is average and does not stand out from other cars.

Interior
     
     What happened to the man-made 'leather-looking' seats that Mercedes has used since time immemorial? Mercedes has replaced its formerly more attractive vinyl seats to tacky printed fabric seats which are extremely hard and uncomfortable. They look cheap. However, the dash resembles one of high end luxury car interiors rather than low-end luxury ones. Wood trim is included and the former digital climate controls and various knobs are now manual. There is dual climate control standard. Cool features of the C-class is a button which keeps the heat on for 30 minutes after the car is turned off. This may be used for passengers waiting in the car during the winter. As well, the trunk release and door lock controls are in the center console. Regarding interior space, the front is fairly roomy and the back lacks comfortable leg space for long rides or for more than 2 people. The C-class sports some newer style rear headrests which downward motion is controlled from the center console. Storage space is plenty and the glove compartment and front arm rest each have 2 seperate spaces for storage. The rear passengers have 2 cupholders and control over the rear air outlet. 

The Key
The new Mercedes key is unlike any regular car key. Rather, a metal key approximately one inch long is inserted into a larger plastic key which has an infrared protrusion. The infrared part is inserted into the keyhole, which is not on the steering wheel but on the lower dash. So, you're not inserting a metal key into the keyhole but rather, a plastic infrared one. This key not only controls the usual lock, unlock and trunk but it also opens all windows. The Trunk release button opens the entire hatch and not just simply unlocks it. 

The Driving Experience

       The 2001 C-class offers an absolutely dead quiet ride. I can drive through speed bumps and unpaved roads with no discomfort. The experience is so smooth that I don't even notice going 160 km/h on the freeway. It feels like I'm only travelling 100 km/h. This could be a downfall when you get a ticket without even trying to speed! As for cornering, the C-class was not made to turn at high speeds and handling is average. The steering wheel is somewhat smaller than average cars and stiff. I find the turning signals at awkward positions and it makes it hard to talk on my cell phone while driving. In other words, it is hard to steer and drive with only one hand. The C-class is fast! It takes off with ease even from a dead stop. The speedometer ends at 270 km/h so I have not tested its ultimate limit yet. The C-class also comes standard with Manual tiptronic drive on an Automatic. Manual driving is only a push away!

Overall

      The C-class should come standard with such amenities like alarm, power seats, air conditioning and xenon lights but instead, Mercedes chose to replace those with a computerized menu on the speedometer offering 10 pages of settings which are controlled from the steering wheel. For example: the time it takes for the headlights to turn off, running km before the gas empties, the radio, and problems with the engine. I do not understand this! However, the C240 Classic is a beautiful car exterior and interior-wise and sports the looks of an S-class at a fraction of the price. Compared with other cars in its class, such as the BMW 323, Audi A4, Acura 3.2, and Lexus IS300 the 2001 C-class is definitely more attractive and classier-looking. With a new V6 engine and base price of $38,000 CAD you can't go wrong! The C-class is a symbol of class and elegance.
