            I came into the market for a new car in late March of 2003, when my previous car, an '88 Prelude Si, was crushed by a Ford Explorer.  I absolutely loved that car, and I was extremely upset at its demise.  But, I can now say I'm glad the driver of the Explorer wasn't looking where she was going, because my new car is ten times better.  I knew I wanted another Prelude; I loved the combination of performance and economy, but I was somewhat limited in my funds. I did look at a few other vehicles, including a '97 Pontiac Trans Am, and a 2000 Toyota Celica GTS.  But, after a surprisingly short search, I found myself test driving a black '97 Prelude automatic.  Five minutes into the test drive, I was sold.  The car had about 70k miles on it, but had been kept up fairly well, and had a few nice additions to it.  An extremely dark tint(looks cool, but a pain to drive at night), custom alloy wheels, and Z-rated tires were just added perks.  After gladly agreeing to pay 11 grand for it, I've now spent the last four months racking up 7000 miles on it.   

My impressions thus far:
Very fast, especially considering the size of the engine.  The automatic transmission clearly drains some acceleration at low RPMs, but once it hits 3500 or so, the cars moves along nicely, and then comes 5000... Man, do I love VTEC!  Even with the auto, it absolutely screams once the VTEC kicks in.  I've struggled mightly to avoid tickets, but it's a losing battle.  Shortly after purchasing it, I took it out on an empty stretch of highway to see what it could do. I was amazed as I pushed close to 140 in this automatic, front wheel drive, six year old four banger.  

My girlfriend has always favored muscle cars with big V8's, but she had so much fun driving this car, she became a Honda convert. I now have to practically fight her for it! 
The fuel economy is also fairly good, and it is very civilized at lower speeds.  I have seen complaints that the downshifts on the auto's manual shift feature are overly jerky, but I've found that once one gets the timing down, it is no longer an issue.  I also disagree with the large contingent that doesn't like the conservative interior.  I find it very comfortable and practical, as well as surprisingly roomy. This car corners better than any front wheel drive car I have ever driven, and it has excellent brakes that have saved me from accidents a couple times already.

Now, is it perfect?  Not quite.  While I do have more than enough head and legroom(I'm 6'4", and not very flexible), the steering wheel position is awkward, and not nearly adjustable enough; it is very difficult to find an easy driving position.  The only extra option that I wish this car had is a telescoping wheel.  That would make my life easier, and allow me to stop constantly fiddling with the seat position. Also, insurance costs are a major pain.  I'm 21, and was 20 when I bought the car, and I'm paying absurd amounts to keep the insurance company happy.  Of course, the way I drive, I can understand it.  Also, while the paint job is very good, it is difficult to keep clean, I have to hand wash and wax it in order to make it look clean for more than a couple days at a time.  But I think that's a problem with most black cars.

Overall, I have very few complaints about this little rocket, and I definitely intend to take good care of it(although the temptation to drive it hard is strong).  I wanted the best possible combination of speed, handling, fuel economy, and reliability, and for my budget, this was easily my best choice.
