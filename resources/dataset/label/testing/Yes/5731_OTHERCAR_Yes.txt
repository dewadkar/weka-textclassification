                   I own a 1992 Plymouth Acclaim that now has about 180,000 miles on it.  It's an odd light-blue color with a dark-blue interior.  It surprisingly has few optional features.  The only features it has are: a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, child safety locks and windows, and that's about it.  No power windows/locks.  Not even a cassette player.
       Even though it's a very basic model, I have really enjoyed owning and driving this car.  It gets great gas mileage (35mpg on the highway) and is very reliable for a compact American car.  As I said before, it has 180,000 miles on it.  It has NEVER had any electrical problems.  It has NEVER had any transmission problems.  The engine, transmission, starter, shocks, and power steering systems are all original.  Not a single problem with any of these things.  The alternator, radiator, and head-gasket are new.  These things were replaced somewhere between 100,000 and 160,000 miles.
      I have NEVER had any problems with squeaks or rattles on the interior.  The body is still sqeak and rattle free.  The interior pieces are all very well assembled.  Nothing has broken or fallen off, except for the driver-side window handle which came off in my hand one day when I tried to roll the window down.  It didn't really break though.  I easily snapped it back into place.  Still works!
      Of all the compact 4-cylinder American cars made in the early '90's, the Plymouth Acclaim/Dodge Spirit are some of the best.  They have proven to be more reliable and durable compared to what Ford and Chevy offered as comparable models back in '92, which were the Ford Tempo and the Chevy Corsica.  Comparable Japanese '92 models, such as the Honda Accord, were and still are much more expensive to buy, maintain and insure.  
      I definetely recommend the '92 and newer Plymouth Acclaim/Dodge Spirit to anyone looking for safe, cheap, and reliable transportation.    I wrote an opinion on this car under "1995 Plymouth Acclaim" if you want to read my opinion there.

I have some really bad news about my poor old '92 Acclaim.  I was rear-ended and the car is totalled!  The rear bumper is literally where the back seat is supposed to be.  Of course, now that the car has a little over 182,000 miles on it and I've had it for 7yrs., the car is worth so little money.  I tried to get a price on what the car is worth at Kelly Blue Book .com, but it just says "No Value", meaning that the car is so old and has such high mileage that it's not worth anything.  This is actually the 4th accident the car has been in...this one being the worse of the bunch.  Luckily, I wasn't at all hurt, even though I hit the dashboard...yes, I was wearing my seatbelt Mom! Lol.
