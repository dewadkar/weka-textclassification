            This is such an awesome product, My wife got this model about a month ago and the results are wonderful.  WE love the convenience of the CD storage, It will hold about 160-170 at highest resolution or 1000 at the low resolution setting. Also the convenience of popping in the cd and instantly viewing the photos is a major plus. The only improvement to this camera that I feel could be made is that I think if the resolution were higher it would be even better, but I really have no complaints!
After taking several shots and printing them out onto a HP Deskjet 930 and 970, there are some great results up to a size 8X10 on a home printer. I am sure you could get enlargements professionally done with great results too.
 Anyone who is into the detailed photography will enjoy the features on this camera,  I really like being able to take black and white photos or sepia tone photos.  The flash has a red eye setting so you don't have any problems with red eye taking close up shots with the flash.  The software is pretty good that comes along with the camera.  I also bought an additional battery for times that I know I will be out of town and make sure I have plenty of time as I like being able to look back on the viewer to see what was taken.  You can use filters that are 52mm with this lens.  I just think it is a really cool product and I would highly recommend it.  I have been very impressed and satisfied so far with this product.<br><br>
