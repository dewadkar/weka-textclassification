            For the past 11 months I have loved my Escape.  Wonderful appearance, great ride, excellent size and body styling, great handling and fun to drive.  Would have liked better interior lighting option - map lights in front or on the mirror - a compass and outside temperature option. The gear shift blocks the radio and the rear window defroster controls. The gas tank seems very small and the mileage does not seem to match what Ford estimated.  Although I initially had problems with the rack and pinion bracket and body side molding everything has been OK for the past few months and I now have 12,400 miles on the car.   I am considering buying a 2002 Escape or Tribute if they upgrade the options available.  All in all I love my Escape.
