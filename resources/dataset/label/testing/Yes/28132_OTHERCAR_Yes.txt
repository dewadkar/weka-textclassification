            I purchased this product because of it's price and how easy it is to operate.  Most of the 35mm cameras are really too difficult to pick up and just shot well this camera is just perfect for the novice photographer, and novice computer geek, it is really that simple to use and to download into the computer. I have had to contact Polaroid's tech-reps, for dumb questions and they were simply the greatest.  You can always tell how good a company is by it's employees that speak for the company.  I thought so much of the Polaroid's product that we purchased
each of our children a digital Polaroid 640 for Christmas last year.
I enjoy seeing pictures of our grand-children, as soon as they are taken.
Anyone who wants an easy to use camera that takes great pictures should
purchase one of these cameras.<br><br>
