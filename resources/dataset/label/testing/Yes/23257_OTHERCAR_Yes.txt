            A stock 1995 M3 has the power and handling performance to top nearly 95% of the cars on the road, throw in the fact that the 1995 one is the last OBDI car, and you have a tuner's dream... 

where else can you get all this performance wrapped in luxury and style?

Supportive and comfortable seats keep you planted when doing any extreme maneuvering... the backseats are also more functional than most other 2 door sports coupes... 

The stock suspension is stiff, but still comfortable enough for most people.. besides, this is an enthusiasts car, if you want a soft suspension and body roll, buy a caddy... 

What can you say about the engine without using all the normal superlatives?  of course we in the good ol' US of A got robbed of the 321 hp Euro spec engine, but our 240 hp engine and aggressive gearing give the M3 serious performance figures and more importantly, the seat of the pants acceleration is amazing... 

and if you fancy yourself a tuner, parts abound for this car and they're cheaper than the 1996 OBDII version cars
