            A few months ago I was pondering what new technology "toy" to buy.  I had bought a CD Writer but I needed something new and fresh.  The digital camera quickly caught my eye and that was my next mission.  My mission: find the best digital camera for the money.  Now my definition for the best digital camera for the money means it must take high quality pictures as well as ease of use..  As you will see I have received that from the Sony DSC-30 and more.

Features that this camera includes:

-Lithium battery - none of that re-chargeable battery stuff.  It lasts a while before having to recharge (about an hr or so and it's back to its functionality).  A lithium battery may be expensive but that is since you don't need to buy a new one for a long time.  

-USB port - This was a must! A USB port connection makes transfers much faster and efficient! 

-Zoom-The Zoom on this camera impressed me! It has a 6X digital zoom.  The zoom on this camera is probably better than my 35mm camera.  I found that I could be standing across the street diagonally from a building and still zoom in close enough to read the name of a building.

-Quality-The quality of the pictures are simply amazing.  It is crisp and clear.

Features-There are a variety of features to  help you with your picture taking....date/time,auto flash,adjust whether taking picture inside or outside, size of the picture, etc

software included!  Sony puts some nice software to use with your digital camera.  It makes editing the quality of the photo easy not to mention fun!  On the software you can create anything from greeting cards to sports cards to just a silly looking picture.  Very easy to use which is another reason to buy this Sony product.

camera itself is small! It's not bulky which definitely gets a thumbs up from me.  

One thing to expect is to have to buy another memory card.  My camera only came with a 4MB card which is pretty small.  I suggest at least 16MB so you don't have to worry about when to stop shooting pictures...

My experiences thus far have been nothing short of successful.  I have taken this camera with me to various events including the fourth of July in Philadelphia to catching a picture of a rainbow after a summer storm.

Who should buy this product?  I would recommend this product to anyone out there looking for a digital camera that is easy to use, yet takes crisp and clear photos.  If your like me and love new things this is a good place to look.  

Good luck with your search!  As for me, I continue to enjoy my digital camera...
