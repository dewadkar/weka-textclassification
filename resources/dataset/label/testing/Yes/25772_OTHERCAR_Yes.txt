The new Altima seems to be getting quite the
hype --- as it should!  However, for those
of you who can't afford $14,000 to $16,000,
going &quot;used&quot; might be your best bet!

The 1993 to 1995 Altimas are great cars!
Nice handling, a strong 2.5 liter, 155 horsepower
engine, and power everything gives this car
its reputation of quality and value.

Basically, you will find little difference
between the 1993 Altima and the new Altima
with the exception of the dramatic styling
differences and a couple more tweaks here
and there on the 2000 model.  

I'd recommend this car to college students
and single father/mothers... or anyone else
who are looking for a good quality car for
a whole lot less money!

Test drive an old Altima today, most run around
$4,500 to $7,500 with 70,000 miles on it --- which
means its still a baby!  They go a long way!!!

I like it, and I know you will too!
