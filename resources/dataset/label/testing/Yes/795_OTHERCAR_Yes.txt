            I have owned two Acura's, a 1988 Legend and currently a 1991 Integra
GS 4DR.  The Legend was great and still ran well when I sold it with
210K miles on it.  I did put a few bucks in it but it had a lot of
miles.  But I am really impressed with the Integra.  I bought it with
152K and it now has 167K.  It still runs like new, doesn't leak (or
for that matter, use) any oil, the automatic still shifts crisply, the
handling is precise (but not harsh), starts instantly (even on cold
mornings), doesn't rattle on bumpy roads, and the AC is still ice cold.
The only non-routing maintenance it has needed was a valve adjustment
($150) and replacing the drivers window guide in the door ($50). 

Passenger room is ample but best to put small people in the back.  The
four doors help if you're going to have back seat passengers.  The
seats are very firm (maybe a little too firm) and the contoured front
seats hold you in place.  The ABS brakes (GS only) have helped me 
avoid more than one accident.

I tested a 1991 2DR for a friend interested in buying one which had
about 90K miles on it and I couldn't tell the difference.  The one I
tested did have a 5 speed and the shifting and clutch were smooth and
fairly effortless.  They didn't start putting hydraulic clutches in
the Integra's until 1994 so this year won't have a problem with the
master cylinder going out and leaving you stranded somewhere without
a clutch (like happened to a friend with a 1991 Prelude).

The biggest drawback to this car is the windows.  They have no frame
(like a hard-top) which is why I had to replace that window guide.
Don't close the doors by pushing on the window.  There is some wind
noise but it's not bad.  For a small car, it's pretty quiet.  But
no cup holders.<br><br>
