Fugi ,Mx-1200....a great digital camera!! I used mine for pics for selling and sending pictures to family and friends far away from me,and I can honestly say it takes great pictures!! If you don't like they picture,you can erase it immediately!! Now,that's a feature someone like me needs!!
I purchased it a year ago  not knowing a lot about digital cameras.The whole computer world was new to me as well! I was very careful to read the  instruction manual,afraid of messing something up with it.But I did it! I installed the disc(after calling the company because installation disc was missing and receiving it 3 days after),attached the adapter to the back of the computer,and after 1 hour,I finally uploaded the picture to my computer!! I was amazed!It is so fast and easy! Afraid about the Smart Media card wearing out,I purchased another one for safekeeping.The only thing I should have purchased was the power ac adapter,because with all the pictures I take,it really &quot;sucks up&quot; my batteries!!!


  The price is great,coming from a prestigious company!!! 
The other thing is that contacting the company about a missing installation disc was VERY ,very hard to do.It took me a while to get through to them,then I was transferred to another line,and on hold for nearly an hour.I held on,though until connected(whew!!). I spoke to the   representative and told her my dilemma.She was kind,courteous and apologetic.She sent me the disc out right away,and I received it in 3 days!!!Now,that is service!!!

I would recommend that people take the time out to really check the quality of the camera you are  contemplating purchasing.I didn't and was lucky that I  bought the best camera(to me). I would not change a thing about it.
