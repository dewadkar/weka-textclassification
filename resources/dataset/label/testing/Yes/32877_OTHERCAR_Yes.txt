            this oldsmobile is a great running car.88' delta-88 is fast with style and great gas milage.mine has almost 109k miles and runs like new.you give it gas and the 3.8 v-6 engine gives you all the power you could need without draining your tank.all the controls even the turn signal lever feels like new,not like it has been worn out years before.
the motor is easy to tune up and work on{but you won't have to}.
the only thing i don't like is the seats.in mine the driver seat doesn't recline like the passenger side does,so you have to manually bend it to where you want it..and my back isn't the best but if i don't sit just the right way then it starts hurting,but only in this car.
over all it is a great car and i shouldn't be able to get over 200k out of the motor with no problems.i would recommend this car.<br><br>
