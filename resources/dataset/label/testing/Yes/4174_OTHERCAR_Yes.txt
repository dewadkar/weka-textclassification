            A little background... mine is a '95.5 Rodeo V6 5-spd manual 4x4 with power windows, locks, factory brush guard, factory 16" rims, aftermarket sunroof. Bought used early 2002 with 106K miles from dealer, just turned over 118K today. I had a Saab before this and loved it (and will buy another one someday), but purchased this Isuzu looking for a relatively modern, low-maintenance, affordable vehicle.  Previous owner replaced front brakes, alternator, and starter. I just replaced rear rotors, one front caliper, and all pads, and all belts.  Getting ready for the 120K checkup - $350 at the dealer. Timing belt, which must be replaced every 60K miles, is another $350.  

ENGINE
The 3.2L V6 is a decent engine.  The fuel economy is poor for a small (albiet heavy) SUV - I average 14-15mpg both in hard city and fast (80mph) highway driving. Best case fuel economy is 18mpg at a steady 55mph.  Engine powers the vehicle pretty well - actually quite quick off-the-line, but acceleration is slow over 40mph.  I have not experienced the hydrolic lifter "ticking" that many of these engines exhibit (some other Rodeos I drove had it, it's no big deal, just a bit annoying).  

TRANSMISSION/4WD
5-speed manual transmission is good, shifts nicely, and is supposed to be quite reliable.  4x4 is for bad weather use only, makes the car handle a little strange when turning. 

HANDLING
The handling is OK for an SUV.  Quite a bit of lean in turns.  Not great roadholding.  I have the 16" wheels with blocky-treaded tires.  Not dangerous or anything, but definitely not "car-like".

EXTERIOR
I like the blocky styling.  Optional factory brush guard looks good.  Bumpers are metal and bend very easily (and eventually rust - not mine but I see a lot of rusty ones on the road here in Maine).  Sheetmetal isn't much thicker than aluminum foil and bends very easily.  The spare tire is in the way of the awkward rear tailgate setup, and blocks visability. 

INTERIOR
I think the interior is well-thought out and nicely designed. The '95.5 dash is a clean design, apparantly they got some help from Honda (Honda Passport is identical to the Rodeo).  Fit and finish is good, as is choice of materials (for example, door panels are durable plastic with cloth-like inserts, won't wear out like the cloth on some cars. manual shift knob is attractive black and silver ball, not cheap plastic like some cars, including newer Rodeos).  Interior is desparately in need of a good cupholder.  Seats are very supportive, although a bit low and short.  I put the driver's seat almost all the way back and I am only 5'11.  Rear seats are very roomy, doors open nice and wide.  Factory stereo is OK, not great. Rear speakers are very low quality, but are conveniently mounted on the ceiling, out of the way.
