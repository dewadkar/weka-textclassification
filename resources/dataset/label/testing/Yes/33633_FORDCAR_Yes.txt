            Okay.  When I was in highschool and turned 16 I couldn't wait to get my first car!  Well, like most 16 year old girls, you dream of getting the sporty, cherry-red, convertible type of car.  Well people, I didn't get it!!  What I got was a used 1990 Ford Escort.  It was dark blue and frankly just didn't look to &quot;cool&quot; to me (you know how highschool is?  Everything has to be &quot;cool&quot;. what is up with that?!)But anyway...I had to drive it.  My dad paid only $5,000 for it and how was I going to by myself a car at 16?  Needless to say, I really grew to love that car.  It got great gas mileage.  It never gave me any major problems. It was always reliable.  And (this may seem corny) it seemed to &quot;fit&quot; me perfect....you know, it didn't seem like I was driving a big boat!!Well...I drove that car for nine years up until a few months ago (told you it was reliable), until I got to where I could buy a new car.  I was on a mission for a new car....maybe something sporty, cherry red...you know.  But what did I end up buying???  ANOTHER Ford Escort.  That's right people, I couldn't help it.  I bought a used 1998 Ford Escort SE.  It had 14,000 miles on it and I got a really good deal on it (about $9,500).  I just knew I would be happy with it!!  And that it would last a long time.  And just like I knew I would, I am very happy with it.  It's got the same great qualities as my &quot;old&quot; Escort when I first got it and actually, the body style of the new Escorts look GREAT!!!!  So, if your looking for a nice-looking car, reasonably priced, reliable car...the Ford Escort SE (to put in the terms of my highschool days) is pretty &quot;COOL&quot;!<br><br>
