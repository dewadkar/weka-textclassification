            Being a Toyota (aka Lexus) fan, I had my hopes set on several offerings from Lexus, without much surprise, the Lexus automobiles were terrific, out-of-stock and cost no less than FULL retail. :-) Owing myself a comparison of cars between manufacturers, I headed over to the Infiniti dealership. 

The I30 (as they were known up-until 2001) and Nissan Maxima's always were relatively similar in design and quality, especially noticeable on the inside. You would always hear I30's described as an "expensive maxima" -- todays I35 has made generous gains in luxury appointments, over-all quality in materials and manufacturing, simply said, the two cars are now nothing but distant relatives that share only the high-quality Nissan drive-train and chassis. Nissan/Infiniti truly sought to diverge the two cars lines even further.

The new 3.5 litre V6 (referred to as the "VQ" engine) produces incredible amounts of HP in relation to its displacement and weight -- but, more importantly its ability to produce gobs of torque. Even with the 4-speed automatic transmission, the car delivers power early and effectively propels the car to triple digit speeds with ease, and very little cabin noise while doing so. Add into mix the sophisticated traction-control and Vehicle Dynamic Control* (VCD), you find yourself driving a true-luxury-sport vehicle.

I opted for the "Sport" package. This option offers lower profile tires, 17" wheels, less "floaty" suspension, and visual accents are applied (such as chrome door-sills). 

I cant truly give a complete review without noting on the ample front leg/shoulder room, excellent rear leg/shoulder room, large trunk, surprisingly great BOSE stereo, seat warmers that actually work well (front and rear seats!) Excellent Navigation System, clear and clean gauges, multiple DC sockets and a great on-board computer/compass.

Its very hard to price this car beyond the mid 30's with almost all of the luxury options (you could always skip the $1,600 chrome 17" wheels). Even while being priced very well, its greatest features dont start with its cost.. This car shouldnt be judged solely off its "bang-for-the-buck" quotient! 

Finally, one indirect fact, but worth noting is the low numbers of I35's you'll find driving around, adds a little mystique. 

Can you guess which car I purchased :-)

I just passed 3,000 (1/6/02) on the odometer, the car is still as quiet, squeak free as it was when I purchased last November (2001)

[*Vehicle Dynamic Control system* monitors lateral G forces, wheel speed, yaw rate, and steering wheel angle when cornering, and brakes individual wheels and/or adjusts engine output to help correct understeer or oversteer. The result is an exceptionally smooth driving experience. ]
