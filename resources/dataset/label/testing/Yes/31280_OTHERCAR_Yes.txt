            If you want technical information, go somewhere else (no offense) but if you just want to know whether or not you'll be comfortable, this is the review to read! The four-door large model toyota tercel is easily the most comfortable vehicle I've ever had the privelege of riding in. Now I finally understand what &quot;luxury car&quot; really means, and I'd definitely call this car luxurious.

Legroom, anyone? This car offers plenty. As a backseat passenger for a five hour drive to Michigan, I got to know this car pretty well and I don't have a single complaint. I actually was having FUN just sitting in the car! It was like laying on a big comfy couch. 

The ride is as smooth as ever. You don't even feel the road as you whiz down the road knowing you're more comfortable than any other drivers and passengers you see. It almost makes you want to laugh at them. Whether you're riding, driving, or taking a nap on a long road trip, you'll definitely enjoy the plush, roomy interior of this wonderful car!<br><br>
