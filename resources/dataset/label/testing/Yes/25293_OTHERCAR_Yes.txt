            After much research and personal recommendations, my husband and I decided to purchase the Nikon Coolpix 700 digital camera.  We wanted a megapixel camera with a reasonable price and an excellent reputation.  We had considered the Coolpix 950, but thought it a bit too pricey for the added features.  

The Nikon 700 is relatively easy to use, but does use up alkaline batteries very quickly.  We quickly purchased 2 sets of NiMh batteries and a charger.  I would highly recommend purchasing a larger CompactFlash card if you like to take lots of pictures.  

We put the camera to the ultimate test.  A family vacation to Walt Disney World.  It was great to be able to snap lots of photos of the kids and the sites and review them to delete the less than perfect shots.  We found ourselves snapping many more photos than we would have taken with a 35mm.  The rechargeable batteries are a must with this camera, especially if you like to use the LCD display.  We were a bit disappointed in the results of photos taken using the digital zoom feature of this camera.  Other than the lack of an optical zoom, this camera is great.

Recommended accessories:
2 sets of rechargeable NiMh batteries
battery charger
additional CompactFlash memory cards
lens cap holder
