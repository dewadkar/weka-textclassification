            Well, lets start this out by saying that I am very picky about my cameras.  I was looking for a digital camera, but I was very picky about which one I was going to choose and what I wanted it to do.  This camera is everything that I expected about a digital camera and more.

For starters, this camera takes wonderful pictures.  They look really good and are very easy to take.  You simply point the camera where you want to take the picture and press button.  The camera does the rest of the work and shows you the picture on the screen on the back of the camera.

Ever since I started looking for a Digital Camera, I have always headed toward the Olympus Cameras.  For some reason, I like the look of them and I love the features that they have.  Not to mention I have heard a lot of good things about Olympus lenses.  I finally found this camera at a good price and I could turn it down.  I had to go with the camera and I am really glad that I have ever since.

The pictures this camera takes look better then any picture that I have taken with my 35mm camera.  It has many different picture settings that you can use.  Obvisouly the higher the setting of the picture, the more memory space it is going to use.  However, I use the High Quality setting and I still get many pictures out of one memory card.  I can use the 8MB card that came with this camera and get over 30 pictures on the High Quality setting.  Using the Super High Quality setting however, I only get 2 or 3, but I figure if I'm going to use a picture with quality like that, I'm going to be right by my computer.  There are some lower settings that will allow even more pictures but I have never used them as I have been happy with the HQ setting that I use.  My 32 MB card that I use can hold over 140 pictures on this setting so as you can see, I really don't have to spend a lot of money to get a huge card to get a good amount of pictures.  The camera is capeable of using cards up to 64 MB.  I have never used one that size yet, but reading the directions says that the card can hold over 250 pictures.  Like I said, I only use the HQ setting and these amount of pictures are on that setting and the pictures that I get out of it are great.  I have a HP 940 Cse Printer and I use glossy paper to print the pictures.  They turn out really good and you can blow them up to 8 x 10 size with no problem and it still looks great.

With the D-460 you can zoom in a couple of ways.  One way is the optical zoom in which the lens of the camera does the zooming like a 35mm camera would when you see the lens go in and out.  It's a little different however because the lens moves inside the housing so you don't actually see it move.  You can also zoom digitally in which the camera takes the image that the lens sees and zooms it in and brings everything closer.  The optical zoom goes 3x the normal size, and the digital goes 2x the normal size.  If you zoom the Digital and Optical Zooms out as far as they will go, you get a 6x zoom total.  This is a really close picture without having to have one of those huge lenses that you see professionals carry around to get closeups.

The screen on the back of the camera has a few uses.  You can view pictures that you have already taken, see what you are about to take, or see what just got taken.  If you turn the camera on like you are going to take a picture and then turn the screen on, you see on the screen like if you were looking through the eyepiece.  This is really nice if you are using a tripod to take your pictures.  When in this mode, right after you take this picture and it is writing the picture to the memory card, you can see the picture on the screen for a few seconds till the write process is finished.  You can also use it to view all the pictures that you have taken and decide wheather or not you want to keep the pictures.  There is a timer feature that also works very nice if you are using the camera on a tripod.  You can set the timer and view your picture through the screen.  Press the button and have 12 seconds to get into the picture yourself so that you can be included.

This is a great camera for the professional who wants to take beautiful pictures, or the beginner who is just getting used to digital photography or even any photography for that matter.  If you are in the market for a digital camrea, stop and take a look at this camera (or any Olympus for that matter) you won't be disappointed.  I have shown this camera to all my friends and family members.  They all love it and they all take advantage of it.  If they need pictures that they don't want to wait to develop they come to me and ask me to take pictures for them.

The only drawback that I have found with this camera is that the serial cable that comes with it uses serial technology which is very slow.  I got around this very easily by getting a Smart Media Card Reader (seperate epinion).  This helps with both speeding up the transfer process, and also at the same time saves on battery power.  Digital Cameras use lots of power and eat up batteries very fast.  The Olympus D-460 uses CV-R3 batteries as well as AA batteries.  You can use one or the other.  The CV-R3 last much longer but are much more expensive.  The Card Reader saves much of this money as I don't go around spending all that on the batteries.

I highly suggest you pick up this camera, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
