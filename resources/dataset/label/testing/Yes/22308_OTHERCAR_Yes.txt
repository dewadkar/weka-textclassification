            My husband and I bought MAZDA 2000 MPV because we wanted more room than our 4-door sedan. We actually wanted an SUV, but right when I saw the MPV, i do have to say that I fell in love. Now, this is pretty weird for us since my husband is 22 and I'm 23. But, our daughter who is 5, hauls a lot of stuff everywhere and we're planning to have another one. It's gotta be the coolest lookin' minivan around, and I'm not ashamed to say that we bought a minivan. I love it.
The ride is so quiet and smooth. The stereo system is pretty cool for it being basic. I love the way it handles. It does handle like a car. It's easy to park it. The only thing I don't like about the van is that it doesn't have a button you can pull or push to open the &quot;back&quot; door. But, overall, I think it's the best. AND, it's just a cool thing o drive.<br><br>
