            My wife and i purchased this car in Feb, 02 from Reliable Toyota in Springfield, MO. We have purchased our last 6 cars from them and have always been treated great.

We traded in a 1999 GMC Jimmy for the G20 as I was joining the Navy and moving to FL, we wanted a car that would get better gas mileage and still be safe for my wife to drive. I have always owned Toyota's or Acura's but the price was right on this car. 

It was a 1 owner with 76,000 miles on it. The pass, and rear seats didn't even look sat in. It has all the extras, pwr seats, leather, sunroof, etc.

This has been the least maintanence car I have ever owned. Other than oil changes and rotating the tires I have had to do no major service to the car. It now has 84K miles so of course the 90K service will be comming up but that is expected.

As reading the other reviews every one keeps saying that it has no power. Well they are mistaken, this little 4 cyl has the power. This car is an auto so granted it will have less take off than a manual but we are very pleased. I have added a ram air intake and a K&N Filter to help a little with the low end (many other parts are available at www.g20.net) and changed the spark plugs and wires. 

My wife and I are both under 5'9" so there is plenty of room and we can comfortably have people in the back seat also. The trunk is roomy for a small car and it rides like a dream. 

In closing I would say to buy one of these anywhere you can get a good deal as they will last as long as you take care of them. Normal stuff, nothing out of the ordinary yet.
