            This is a great camera!!! It's so easy to use!  As soon as I opened the box,I charged the battery and read the simple instructions. By the time the battery was charged, I inserted a disk, and started taking pictures. The battery included lasts a long time! You can take many pictures before charging the battery again. Plus it has a quick processing time. You can take a picture, edit or delete it instantly. You can copy and format the disks right inside the camera. There's alot of functions and they're all very easy to use. As parents of a toddler, you wanna just be able to turn the camera on, and snap away--- capturing those special moments! I especially like that I can take a &quot;moving picture&quot; with sound. I can even e-mail this &quot;movie&quot; to a loved one.  Once the disk is full, I can just pop the disk in my desktop computer and boom--you see the pictures on your screen. No special software needed. 

Now, I bought the &quot;Starter-Kit&quot; accessory which includes: the Carrying Case, 3 floppy disks, and another battery (NP-F550). This battery lasts twice as long as the standard battery. The only thing was I am disappointed with the Carrying Case because it fits only the camera and only 3 disks which fit tight inside the zip pocket. I wish that they made the case a little bigger to carry an Extra battery and more than 3 disks. 

The only other thing I didn't like about this camera is that it did not have a screen cover. Nevertheless, I love this camera because it takes quality, printable pictures, ease of use, its lightweight and design and most of all the features. I recommend this item to anyone who is thinking of buying a digital camera.
