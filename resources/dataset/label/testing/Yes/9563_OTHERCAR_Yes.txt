            The 2000 / 2001 Toyota Celica is a bit of a black sheep, or would that be a mixed bag? Reviews on the vehicle often refer to it's 'lack' of sports car soul, or it's lack-luster performance, however the reviews seldom rate the right vehicle.

The Celica is available in 2 models.  The Base GT, and the Sportier GT-S.  The GT offers a 4 cyl. engine capable of delivering a peak of 130 horsepower.  The GT-S on the other hand delivers a variable timed engine that produces 130 to 180 horses depending on driving characteristics. 

I will not speak directly to the GT, as I own a GT-S.  I can say from driving both, that these are not the same automobile.  Where the GT is consistent economy and not truly 'sports car' material, the GT-S makes up the difference.  Solid acceleration with a slight boost in acceleration from 5500 to 8500 rpm as the VVTL-i variable valve timing kicks in, providing a healthy 180 horsepower just in time to shift to second gear at 30mph, where you are met with the wondrous sound of VVTL-i valves breathing at their best.

Did I mention that without a 6-spd gearbox, you might as well go home?  This is a sports car, not a grocery-mobile. Leave your silly 4 speed automatics with pushbutton wannabe sequential automatic gearboxes on the Audi's and Porshe's where the horsepower makes up for the lack of gearing.

Like it's big brother, the soon-to-be available 2001 Supra, the Celica requires the gearing of a manual transmission to perform. Don't get me wrong - I am NOT comparing the two.  The Supra is a 330hp supercar, not a econo-sportscar. I am just saying that when it comes to a sports car, there is no substitute... a manual gearbox is the ONLY option, and I have no doubt.  Reviewers who had the opportunity to try both options in the GT-S would agree.

Handling in the GT-S is exceptional.  Tight cornering at 30mph and on/off ramps at 55mph is perfectly holdable (with only 3 fingers on the wheel no less) but the ride isn't 'jerky' as you would find in most stiffened suspensions.  Prepare for lurching shifts until you learn to speed match the clutch as the gearing is designed for high RPM's, and don't press toooo hard on the brakes, they are surprisingly effective. 

Oh yeah, wipe the smile off your face, the police can see it, and will watch you like a hawk.

Gas mileage is acceptable, though not stellar, when in performance driving mode (in the neighborhood of 23-26mpg) but for average driving, a respectable 33-39mpg.

My final tally...

If you are INTERESTED in the Celica, or indeed in any compact sports car, under $30k test drive the GT-S in a 6-spd.  If you don't know how to drive a stick, then take someone who can, and learn before you pick it up.

If you are ONLY interested in the looks, the GT will suit you fine, but don't try to take on any other import at a set of lights. You'll be disappointed.
