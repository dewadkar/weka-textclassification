            I bought the Olympus D-360L because like a lot of people, I never took in my 35mm film to be processed.  Ever be looking through a catch-all drawer for something and come across an exposed roll of film you never took in to be developed?  What about eight, ten, twelve rolls of undeveloped film?  That was me.  Despite all good intentions, I'd take lots of photographs and then neglect to get the pictures developed.  What a waste of time and energy, not to mention money.

I NEEDED a digital camera.  It saved my sanity and cleaned out my catch-all drawers.

This little camera is a winner!  It comes with an 8MB SmartMedia card that will hold 122 images in lower resolution (640x480) and 36 images in high quality resolution, and up to 18 images in super high quality resolution (1280x960).  You may well ask what does this all mean.  Well, if you just want to email a friend or family member a photo, you can snap some great photos in the lower resolution and zip them right over the internet.  But if you want to print out actual high quality 35mm photograph-looking photos to share with friends and family or to frame, you will definitely need the super high resolution quality that this little camera can produce.  I've printed out on glossy paper photos that look just as crisp and lifelife as a 35mm print from the developer.  No more forgotten rolls of film!  No more too-old-to-process film!  No more lost photos of wonderful occasions.  You've got it all on the 8mb SmartMedia disk or on your computer so you can print them anytime you like, or send them in email to Grandma way over in Hawaii.  

Another great thing about this camera is ease of use.  I bought it, took it out of the box, slipped in the SmartMedia memory card, loaded the batteries, and began to snap photos.  You can review them on the LCD monitor.  You don't like how a photo turned out?  Erase it, zippety-do-dah, take it all over again!  Try doing that with your 35mm.  

The Olympus D-360L comes with a video output cable so you can connect the camera to your TV and view your photographs there.  It comes with 4 AA batteries, the 8MB memory card, battery charger and 4 rechargeable batters, and a Windows connectivity kit that connects the camera to your serial port to download photos.  Olympus also sells accessories for this camera, like the SmartMedia reader that will download the photos to your computer a lot faster (although if you don't have a few minutes to spare to download the photos, your life is way too busy), AC adapter, camera case, floppy adapter for the memory card, and so forth.  But with all the great software that comes with this camera on CDrom and the simplicity of using this camera straight from the box, I just don't think anyone can match it for the price.  

People say this camera is for the &quot;entry level&quot; digital photography world.  I sense that's a little snooty-snoot talking because, let me tell you, this camera takes wonderful clear sharp pictures; the prints of them are fantastic.  It's small enough to fit into a purse or jacket pocket.  It doesn't weigh a ton. It works like a champion, you can take panoramic views, put it on the 12-second timer and get in the photo yourself, review your photos on the screen, erase or save them, take photo close-ups up to 4 inches away, and all this is done with point and click ease.  I don't know what else you would want or need unless you're a photojournalist.  You need higher resolution than this camera offers?  Must be your line of work then because for home use, this is about as high a resolution as anyone could need.  You want to get closer than four inches?  Goodness, are we selling our photos or are we hoping to put them in our family album?  You really want a super close-up photo of the baby's left iris or the nostril hair when Grandpa's sleeping?  

If you want sound equipment for your money, prints anytime you please and however many you please...if you want to grab a camera to catch all those once-in-a-lifetime moments...if you want to forget about going in search of a photo processing place...and if you seriously need your catch-all drawers back from the rolls of old film--hey, try this camera out.  I really and honestly love it to death.  It's the best little tech toy I've gotten hold of in ages.  (And no, I don't own stock in the company.)<br><br>
