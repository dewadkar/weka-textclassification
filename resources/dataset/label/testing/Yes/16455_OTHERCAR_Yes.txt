            My 5-sp SL2 is over a decade old. It's been through the desert and snowstorms. It's been high and low (trip to Death Valley...) and it's been loaded pretty tight. I am assuming that if you're reading a review on the first-generation SL2, you're shopping for an used car.

Best thing about this car: the 4-cyl. 1.9L 121hp engine is still going strong. In fact, I'm still getting back 30-32 miles per gallon with 87 octane fuel. When I first bought it, everyone was raving about the reliability of Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans over domestic compacts (many still are...) True, up until Saturn popped up on the scene, imports ruled the compact-size car market. I was skeptical at first, but I thought that GM's huge investment into Saturn, and the way that the cars were being designed and built pretty much from scratch (instead of platform-sharing with, say, the Cavalier) was worth a try. Over the last ten years, I have done little work mechanically, and must say my Saturn proved to be as reliable as my neighbor's Honda Civic.

<b>Replaced under warranty within the first 36k mi/3 yrs.:</b>
A/C compressor (1st year)
Moonroof rail (2nd year)
Trunk-mounted 3rd brake lamp (light bulbs)

Aside from that, other non-warranty repairs were:
Motor mounts (6th year)
Clutch
O2 sensor
Moonroof (won't open, also won't stay closed)
Power steering pump (8th year)
A/C compressor (8th year)
Fuel pump (9th year)
Automatic seatbelt (9th year)
Power locks (9th year)

Of course, preventive maintenance with regular oil/filter changes help a lot. I was pretty religious about this the first five years, but later cut myself some slack... Still follow the maintenance schedule. Changed batteries, brakes, tires, shocks and the occasional lightbulb... all the regular wear-n-tear stuff.

The original paint job is superb. I regularly washed and waxed it, so I take credit for helping a 10 yr-old car look like half its age. There are very few 10 yr-old cars that have paint looking as sharp as 10 yr-old Saturns.

Handling is good, a bit on the firm side. I changed my struts/shocks at Midas and the ride got softer, with more body roll. If you want to keep it the way it was, get Saturn parts. They tend to be expensive through the dealers, but there are some salvage yards over the Internet specializing in Saturn parts.

Inside, the car is simple, with all the gauges and controls pretty legible and logical. Back in '91, it didn't look cheap compared to other econocars. No airbags on this one. The A/C was stronger than many similar-sized imports. The seats were firm, but not very comfortable, especially for longer trips. The rear seats were too low, the seatbacks too straight, and the seat cushions too short. Nevertheless, it sits two or three to get from point A to point B. Late model S-series have lower seats for a sportier feel. (I prefer taller seats.) Trunk space is okay, but the seats fold in a 60/40 split, so you have access to the passenger compartment for storage as well.

While it is a good car for basic transportation, I wish Saturn would have given the topic of overall refinement more thought, especially in later models. For a '91, my SL2 was pretty refined and well-equipped. Still, interior build quality is still subpar compared to Japanese makes. My brother bought an old '85 Toyota Camry and the interior is still free to squeaks and rattles. On the other hand, my '91 Saturn has interior plastic molding that is falling apart, the sunvisor is completely loose, and the dash squeaks and rattles. Engine, road and wind noise prevail.

At this point, for an used car, '91 SL2s would be decent basic transportation. Insurance rates are low and all you have to do is make sure the car passes smog testing and that the mechanicals/electricals are in good shape. Makes for a good beater car. You may even have some fun revving it up.
