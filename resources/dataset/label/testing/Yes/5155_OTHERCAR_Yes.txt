            Unfortunately, Epinions doesn't have a sub-category for the GTP version of this car, which this review is for.  If you are interested in the GTP Grand Prix, this review will be of a great deal of interest.  If you are only looking at the models below it, the review should prove to be informative none the less.

Let's get going....

I've allways been a fan of the GTP Line of Grand Prix's, and would love to own a new 3.8L Supercharged version, but unfortunately the pocketbook just couldn't swing it, so when I had the recent opportunity to buy a mint 1991 GTP model instead, I jumped on it.

First impressions:

- The 3.4L Dual Overhead Cam 24 Valve engine does the car justice, producing over 200+ horsepower, which makes the car snap to attention with a blip of the throttle, and can make for a very spirited ride if you should choose.

- The suspension setup provides *excellent* handling for a car this size and weight, but as with most sport oriented vehicles, is very harsh and tight.   For the sport oriented driver, this is expected and appreciated - for someone who likes a smooth cushy ride, it will *not* be appreciated.

- Fit and finish, even for a used 1991 car with over 230,000 Kilometers on it at purchase is still excellent.   There is no dash rattles, and only the expected noises.   All accessories (including the 10+ way adjustable seats, HUD, Cruise, Steering wheel radio controls, etc) all still work perfectly.

- The HUD (Heads Up Display) option was installed on the car I purchased, and has proven to be nice, not only for it's usefullness factor (as designed), but for the "Oh Wow" factor it gets from others.  Ensure that if you have to change the windshield to certify a used purchase that you replace it with one specifically designed for the HUD equipped car, otherwise the HUD image will appear fuzzy on a non-HUD windshield.

- This car is comfortable!  Although not all Grand Prix's may have the seating option that comes with the GTP, mine is equipped with front and rear buckets, and the fronts have a multitude of adjust options, over 10 different individual adjustments per seat.  Power lumbar (Times 3), power headrests, etc etc make for a guarenteed comfortable ride during long trips, and for secure and tight seating during spirited driving.    I have yet to drive a vehicle with better seats, nevermind the adjustment possibilities.

Driving:

If you want it, the 3.4L DOHC can provide a kick in the pants with an easy flip of the gas pedal, but be warned that you will pay for it at the gas pumps - this engine can be thirsty if driven anything except gently.   Since the GTP is geared towards being driven in a sport fashion, and most GTP owners do exactly that, don't expect stellar milage.  If you want maximum fuel economy in a Grand Prix, find a non GTP version with one of the smaller engines, but don't expect anything close to the same performance.

For a sizeable car, handling is excellent.  Fully independant rear suspension and decent front suspension geometry makes this car stick to the ashphalt exceptionally well, and will outhandle most other cars on the road except for true sportscars, and all but the best imports.

Downfalls:

- Brakes!  Although the front brakes are decent enough, the rear disc brakes on the Grand Prix series (And many other early 90's GM vehicles with rear discs) are notoriously problematic.  If you are thinking about buying a used one, be prepared to spend money doing the rear brakes, as unless regularly maintained by the previous owner, they are usually not functioning 100%, or often not functioning at all.  Installation of new calipers (And probably pads) is the fix,  but the backyard mechanic should be warned that GM's rear discs are a whole different beast then the front discs, and a complete replacement job takes much more time then front brakes, mainly due to the layout of the caliper bolts (hard to access) and the emergency brake cable removal and reinstallation.   It's do-able for the home mechanic, but make sure you have good tools, and lots of time.  If you have someone who can get your parts at wholesale, it's also a big advantage, as they are expensive.

- Turning Radius is lacklustre, at best..   Why Pontiac would make a sportscar that turns like a houseboat is beyond me...surely something could have been done about this, as it's a common problem that most GP owners complain about.

- The fuel milage on the 3.4L engine is borderline horrible if the car is driven in a sporty fashion routinely.  Unfortunately, the adrenaline kicks that the GTP can provide  are expensive.  :-)

- At least on my car, and reportedly others, a phantom "Check Guages" indication remains lit on the HUD.  Although I've allready gotten used to ignoring it for the most part, it might irritate others.  A fix doesn't appear straightforward, or even evident.

Other issues:

- The timing belt on the 3.4L DOHC engines in the GTP's are known for the large amount of work involved to replace them.  Thankfully, this is a non-interference engine, so it will not destroy itself if the timing belt lets go, but the replacement of the belt is rumoured to be a 4 hour job (At a shop), so the labour part of it can be expensive...  If your buying a used GP with the DOHC 3.4L, try to get a new timing belt rolled into the agreement to purchase - you'll save yourself alot of money down the road.

Overall?

This car is a blast!  Although the GTP version is slightly more expensive to operate and insure then the other base models below it, if you are a driver who is willing to take some liberty's with your wallet to enjoy a car that is legitimately fun to drive, this car might very well be for you.

Most people who own these cars do take care of them, so finding them in good to excellent shape is not a difficult task.

If your not handy, have a mechanic check it out first and see what's required to bring it back 'up to par', paying particular attention to the driveline and rear brakes.

If you find a good one, grab it, strap in, and get ready to be the envy of all your friends.. :-)
