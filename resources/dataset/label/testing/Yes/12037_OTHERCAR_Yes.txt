            OK, so I bought this car after a year's worth of reading reviews and realizing it was going to be something special. My local dealer (well, I did call around 30!) had one and, without taking it for a drive, bought it on the spot. San Francisco Bay area dealers don't actually let you drive it first--oh well, understandable. I've had it for about 3 months now and have waited on commenting until feeling more comfortable with it--so here it goes:

What I like: This thing has ample power--the best way I can describe it is &quot;effortless acceleration&quot;. Imagine just sitting on top of an engine without a chassis--it's really zippy in that respect. Also, the car feels like a cross between a formula 1 car and a motorcycle. That 9K red line gives it a real motorcycle feel--in fact, I have beat a few hot shot motorcyclists off the starting line at a red light. It's fast enough for anything around town, for sure...keep this thing around 5K RPM and it'll stay happy.

What I don't like: The car feels small (albeit, not as bad as a Miata). I'm a hair over 5-11 and it feels like I should be sitting a few inches lower in the seat. Also, what's with this back window? It scratches pretty easily, even by throwing a towel back there to soften things when I put the top down. Not bad for a first year car, but did anyone at Honda actually drive this thing practically for any length of time? And how about the radio--the left-side controls need an on/off switch too!

Otherwise, I couldn't imagine owning another car, except maybe a Ferrari 456M GT, but that's also 6-times the price! This is the best car on the road for performance and value. Porsche, BMW, et al., have a lot of catching up to do to compare.<br><br>
