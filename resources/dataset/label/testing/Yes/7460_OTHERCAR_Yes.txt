            The new grand am's are styled very much like the grand prix's.  They have come a long way and are very reliable.  My friend got his new one a few months ago and loves it.  no manufacturer defects in it at all.  It rides smooth, quiet, corners crisply, has plenty of acceleration, and has excellent stopping ability.  Believe me, for a small to mid size car, it flies on the highway, no problem merging or passing.  The fuel economy is pretty good too.  I think it is 23/33 mpg.  It has the standard 170 hp 3.1 liter engine in it.  The seats are very supportive and the headlights actually light up the road ahead of you.  The radio controls on the steering wheel are a nice touch along with abs, traction control, and fog lamps to name a few of his options.  The A/C is ice cold too.  The stereo cranks for a stock radio as well.  Loud, clear, and lots of base.  I highly suggest to take a spin in one and see for yourself.  <br><br>
