               I shoped for the best camera for for the money and came up with this being the deal. 2.3 mega pixel with built in zoom and usb interface under $400.00 !! I have taken many pics and they came out great. I have only 2 small quirks though. 1 is the battery compartment is hard to shut once it is loaded. 2 camera has a place for ac adapter but it requires and odd voltage 5 volts dc. All in all the camera is the best for the buck. I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to save $100.00 to $200.00.<br><br>
