            We are a family of six and bought the EuroVan MV new. It has been great for us. The seating configuration with the table and two rear-facing captain's chairs have been useful on roadtrips, and help keep the kids from getting too close to each other. Seats can be taken out with ease to make room for large loads, and the rear seat folds down completely, opening up cargo space or making a nice bed.
The quality of the interior is a little lacking, especially for a 30k  car. Very spartan design, basic seats, blocky dash  (only cassette player) was a little dissapointing. And the cupholders are absolutely worthless. A lot of plastic everywhere, and there have been some problems with random plastic caps, etc. falling off. The car rattles a bit too much on freeway, especially compared to our previous van, a Toyota Previa, which always felt solid.
The ride and to drive it feels incredibly car-like, although it is definetely intimidating at first due to the sheer size of the thing. This is also definetly not the car for the enviornmentaly concious who would like to use as little gas as possible. It is fairly nimble around town, however.
It looks different than other minivans, and I've always liked that. Its bulk makes it stand out however. All in all, unique but quality, what we've come to expect from Volkswagen.
