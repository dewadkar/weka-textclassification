            I purchased this camera because we were about to retire and travel full time in a motorhome. I wanted a good functional camera to send pictures to friends via e-mail and to avoid the constant having to get film developed. 

I have found the picture quality to be good for my purposes. The camera is easy to learn to use.  It also goes through batteries very quickly. I suspect that most digital cameras also use batteries rapidly. 

I like the compact size for ease of carrying and use. If your camera is not with you it doesn't do much for you, no matter how good it is. I have now been using it for about 8 months and would consider it if I were buying tomorrow. 

For outdoor use it should have a view finder, in addition to the view screen. It does not, so it works best indoors. In bright sun it is extremely difficult to locate the object you wish to photograph. 

Another good feature of this camera is the fact that it uses the &quot;Smart Media&quot; to store pictures. This is a very compact media which is available in sizes from 4 megabytes to 32 megabytes. If size is important, this is the best storage media. 

The camera also comes with a belt pack for ease of carrying.  It also provides some protection for the camera when not in use. <br><br>
