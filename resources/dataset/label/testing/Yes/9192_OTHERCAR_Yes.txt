            We've owned this van for over a year and it has been problem free to date.

The van is very roomy (we have the extended wheelbase with four captain's chairs and a fold-down third row seat).  2-3 weeks of groceries are no problem, though they can't all fit in the back (with it's compartments and plastic bag hooks).

We purchased a top of the line model with leather, CD, etc.--everything except the LCD screen.  (You can buy a bigger car TV with DVD/VHS capabilities for less than $1400!)

The front/rear seat controls are nice, with the kids being able to listen to either a CD or the radio, though it has to be the same CD if the front passengers are also listening to the CD.

The seats have held up well.  We tend to leave one of the middle row captain's chairs out at all times for the extra room.

Mechanically the van has been great.  We change the oil every 3000 miles.  The tires have held up well with about 20,000 miles on them.

Our only complaint is the way the controls (locks, buttons, etc.) work.  They are usually backwards to the way you would intuitively think they would work.  What happened to up/down toggle switches for window controls?  I do not associate lifting a lever with a window!  In addition the car refuses to lock when you push the lock lever (again a counter-intuitive switch); it just beeps at you.  Eventually, when/after you close the door it will lock.  Well, there are times when I want the car to lock NOW, not when the doors close.  The interior lights are another nightmare.  There is no way to determine whether you've left one on until you shut the doors (and/or locked them) and wait for the lights to go out.  They won't toggle, either, so if you've left the back lights on it is a game of pressing the light button, closing the car up and waiting for the lights to go out to see if you got the right button.

Other than that the van is very nice.  The controls are annoying enough to make me switch to a Pontiac or other model...check them out before you buy!
