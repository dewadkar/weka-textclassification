              Even though I am only 21 and I have only had three cars in my life so far, I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite automobiles.  It's very powerful and convenient.  See my web page!  I bought it from a couple that was about to have a first child.  They didn't need a convertible (fun) car, they wanted something more family like.
  When I first went to check it out I noticed all the luxuries it had.  Power everything: steering, brakes, windows, door locks, driver's seat, side view mirrors, and top!  Also, A/C, cruise control, tilt wheel, driver's airbag.  One of the things I really liked about this convertible is that it has a glass (and heated) rear window, not like other convertibles that have plastic windows that are very difficult to see out of.  The interior design is excellently laid out, all the instrument readouts are very easy to read at a glance, and all the cockpit controls are very easy to understand.
  The car is extremely powerful with a 3.0 liter V6 engine and with an overdrive (4-speed) transmission it gets great gas mileage (city: 24-26 highway: 26-32).  This is the first convertible I have ever owned and I must say: &quot;I love to drive with the top down!&quot;.  I think this is one of the few convertibles that actually looks good with the top UP OR DOWN.
  I haven't had any big expensive problems with the car.  It currently has 112k miles on the clock and these are the things I have had done:
Replaced: motor mounts, timing belt, spark plugs and wires, rotor and dist. cap, battery, quarter window motor, valve cover gaskets, suspension (springs, shocks, and struts).  This A-604 overdrive (4-speed) transmission is known to be problematic although I haven't had any problems with the one in my car.  The quarter window motors are problematic as well and having replaced mine myself I can say that it is not a difficult repair just time consuming.  See the web page for information.

I love this car so much that I wrote a web page about it, to see visit:
