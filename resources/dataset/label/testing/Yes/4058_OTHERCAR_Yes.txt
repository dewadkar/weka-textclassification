            ... even if he isn't even a dad yet!

Have you ever noticed how sometimes life has its little ways of playing tricks on you? As I continue on into the adventure known as adulthood, I find life playing wicked little tricks. You see, I used to tell people, as I rode around in my Ranger pick-up or my Rav4 SUV, that I wanted them to shoot me if I ever bought a minivan. BANG BANG!! So now it's time to be shot.

I couldn't really help it, honest. It's just that with a baby on the way, I really had to admit that not even my RAV4 had enough room for a growing family. Not only that, but my lease was ending and I had already told myself I wanted something bigger. I wanted something priced reasonably. I wanted something just like what I found.

Armed with the three ounces of responsibility I've gained over the last several years, and trying hard to not let the child within me throw a temper tantrum, I researched, read, test drove, and eventually decided upon a 1998 Chevy Venture. It's really pretty slick. It's the extended version with 8 seats, rear climate controls, rear stereo controls, cd player, and just about every other option under the sun, including remote power sliding side door. I managed to snag one of those shiny champagne colored ones and paid just under $18,000.

With a baby on the way, two dogs already in the family, and a spouse who just loves to travel as much as I do, this van just made sense. The back four seat fold down, so I was easily able to load in the new crib when I picked it up. The seats also come out, so I was able to easily load a bassinet, rocker/glider, play pen, high chair, and all those other giant boxes I had the pleasure of picking up after the baby showers. Those removable seats will also come in handy when we pack up all our belongings and move to Chicago right in front of the moving van.

The seats are even pretty comfortable--providing enough room for 3 adults to sit in the rear-most seats. The seats also move back and forward, allowing for adjustments for leg room. This comes in handy when we go out with friends (which we still do until that baby arrives) or family. Head room isn' a problem either. Even my dad can sit in the van with a cowboy hat on and not have it brush the roof.

I appreciate the dual side doors more than anything, however. The remote sliding passenger door is incredibly convenient when your arms are full, and having two side doors works great when loading and unloading a van full of passengers or cargo. Heck, even my dogs like having two doors to go in and out of.

Chevy built the Venture on a car frame. This means that the ride is a lot smoother than some vans, and certainly much more so than most trucks or mammoth SUVs. The Venture handles so much like a car that even my car-owning friends don't mind a turn at the wheel... some are even considering a Venture of their own in the future.

Obviously, the rear climate controls are a bonus, especially when you have someone who likes it a bit warmer or cooler than the folks up front. The ceiling vents also mean that the rear of the van heats or cools quickly even when there's a load of people or things stacked in the back.

A few months ago, my wife, a friend, and I took a nice 10 hour drive from KS to WI. The van was incredibly comfortable, and no one got &quot;bleacher-butt&quot;. During that trip I scored a terrific 30 mpg.  Admittedly, most of the time on the highway (trips of 20 to 45 miles in light traffic) I average around 22-25 mpg. In the city or in heavy traffic, the Venture averages between 18-20 mpg. The 180 horse V6 has the &quot;oomph&quot; to pass on two-lane highways even with a full load in the cargo area of the van... more power than I found in the 4-cylinder engine of my RAV4 or Ranger. And, knock on wood, the van has only been in for the standard maintenance.

I'm content with my minivan, and don't think I'll be asking anyone to shoot me anymore. This Venture is worth the &quot;soccer dad&quot; look when you consider the comfort and power it provides. I'd have no problem recommending the Chevy Venture to anyone, but would recommend it highly to those who need both space and versitility. I'll be driving this van into the ground, but when it's time for a new one I'll likely head straight back for another Venture.<br><br>
