                 After driving the 2000 Bravada for over 5 months now I can safely say I am driving a luxury vehicle.  The 2000 Bravada drives like a car...it's as if your driving on air.  To me that is the number one pro about this vehicle.  I have driven and owned several SUV's and this to me is the first in a long time that doesn't actually feel like a truck.
     Besides the smooth ride, the Bravada comes with all the usual features.  Your choice begins with a standard or automatic transmission, V6 engine, leather or cloth interior, and sunroof.  Standard features includes power window and locks, anti-lock brakes, stereo, A/C, of course airbags, daytime running lights, security system, keyless entry, and finally 4 wheel drive.
     All and all I would rate this vehicle using a scale from 1 to 5 a 4.    <br><br>
