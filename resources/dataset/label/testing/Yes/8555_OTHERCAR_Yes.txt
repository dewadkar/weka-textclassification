            The Grand Am is a step up from my previous car which was a Ford Festiva.  The moment I got in to test drive it, I knew that it was what I wanted and had to have it.  After riding around in a Festiva, driving the Grand Am was like driving in a limo.

<b>Quad 4</b>
I wanted something with power, but not a gas guzzler. The quad 4 is larger than a four cylinder which is 2.3 liters, but not as big as a six cylinder which is 3.0 liters and above.  It gives just enough boost to make you feel like you own the road.  The average gas mileage on the road is 32 miles to the gallon.  I also got a break on my insurance rate because the quad 4 is still considered a four cylinder even though it's larger.

<b>Features</b>
Living in the desert, it gets very hot.  The Grand Am has a powerful air conditioner that cools the car down quickly, yet doesn't bog down the engine, as with most four cylinders.  I've never had the air conditioner serviced yet and it still has the same amount of power as it did five years ago.  The child safety locks are another great feature whether you have kids or not. I, being a single person, find it a great asset to have when playing designated driver.  The little *click* heard as I drive off is reassuring that I won't have to pick up one of my friends off the road at a stoplight when they decide to suddenly reinvent the &quot;Chinese Fire Drill&quot;.  Another feature, although small, but great in value are the interior lights.  With a pull of the door handle, the interior lights come on making it easy to see your keys on a dark night.  The trunk is huge!  My father being handicapped, can easily fit his wheelchair into the trunk when going places.  The car does have an air bag which adds to the overall feel of security when riding in the car.  One great feature that is keeping me from losing my license is the cruise control.  
With one push of a button, the speed is locked and you can relax and do your makeup the right way as you drive along the highway! lol Oh, and it's great on long trips too.  

<b>All that Glitters is Not Gold</b>
As great as the car has been to me, it does have it's drawbacks.  One concern is driving in the dark and the headlights and dash lights suddenly blanking out.  This has happened about 3 or 4 times making me a bit more cautious and careful at night.  There has been some minor cosmetic problems that I've noticed.  For example, the rubber on the arm rests of the doors are pulling away.  The dashboard does also rattle a little bit.

Overall, the Pontiac Grand Am has been a great car to me. It's taken me from the mountains to the desert, cross country and back and still starts up as if fresh off the line.  The minor drawbacks fade in comparison to how reliable the car has been to me.  I will definitely keep the Grand Am in mind when I purchase my next car.<br><br>
