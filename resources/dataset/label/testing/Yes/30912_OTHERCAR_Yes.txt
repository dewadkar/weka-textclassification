            After owning this SC1300 camera for over 1 year it still works great, no major issues. It eats batteries, of course, but they all do this. The LCD screens in these things are real battery hogs. I leave the LCD screen off and use the few finder for photos. My mother dropped her SC1300 on the concrete; it still powers up, but I cannot get it to take any pictures right now but I am planning to fiddle with it a bit and see if I can fix it. I had planned to give my SC1300 to my mother in law but I had to give it to my mother to replace the one she broke because she was so hooked on it. 

After seeing some photos blown up by a friend who had a much more expensive camera, I was ready for an upgrade so I bought a SIPIX SC3300 on sale for 149.00 after rebate at Compusa. See my review of the SC3300. 

Below is the review I initially wrote after the first two months I had the SC1300 and I stand by it:

I have read reviews which have been somewhat negative concerning this camera and feel obligated to post since my experience with this camera has been under diverse conditions. 

I have used it for Christmas photos, a new baby in the family, shots of my house and car for insurance claims, parties, photos of people for their business brochures and cards, photos for ebay actions, photos of merchandise in my friends gift shop, and my first ski vacation in Lake Tahoe. 

You get what you pay for in most cases and I feel that since I only paid 99.00 for this camera in Dec 2001 after rebate, I got a bargain. I gave one as a gift and my mom was thrilled. I gave a lower res version to my niece and she loved it too. 

The pictures are better than what comes out of standard point and shoot 35mm camera. 

It was easy to use after I "RTFM", which is what everyone should do anyway.

It's lightweight(a plus) but tough enough to take it (another plus). I fell down skiing on it so many times and it still worked, it got dropped in snow, rode on a snowmobile, onto rocks, went through airport security, got drinks spilled on it in the casino, etc. and it still worked.  

The software that came with it was helpful for taking care of the few lighting issues, making panoramic stitched photos of Lake Tahoe, and other great photo projects.

There were a few things which held me back; like the preview screen not looking so good outside, but at least you could see if you got the shot lined up right. And when I went indoors to take a break it was easy enough to review, save, and delete, selecting from an abundance of photos that I could take versus the few that might have been taken with a 35mm camera due to film availability and costs.

The flash is the most powerful and helpful, and the flash response time best, when the batteries are fresh. Get some NMHY rechargable ones, and keep a set charged and ready to go at all times. The LCD preview window causes the fastest battery drain. Used the LCD only for photos preview when absolutely necessary. Turned it off when not needed.

Of course, the resolution is not good enough to blow stuff up into posters, but come on people-the thing costs under $100.00. 
Give it a break.
