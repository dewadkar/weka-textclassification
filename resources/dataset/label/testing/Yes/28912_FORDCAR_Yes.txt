            When I purchased the 2000 Ford Explorer Limited for myself (on my b-day), I didn't realize what i was getting into.

Being 23, you're used to driving "young-people cars" like Jettas and Explorer XLTs, but I was blessed by being able to spend just over $36,000 (tax incl) for a luxury SUV.  I have all the available options, except for the 6 disc changer.

I looked at the Mercedes ML (looks like a minivan), the Lexus RX (looks like the old AMC), and the Montero Sport and Limited (good styling, but nothing inside).  

This is an AMAZING car (esp mine...all black, with the limited 16" wheels).  I've never gotten these many stares in any of my previous cars.  

Exterior:
Solid paintjob.  Fender flares abound (this was done by ford to weigh the car down, so it would be less prone to rollovers).

Standard running boards, puddle lamps, and fog lamps.  The lights can also be set to auto (when the car senses the sun set, it automatically turns on the headlights).

Heated outside mirrors

Interior:
leather seats, power everything, heated seats, moonroof (oh what a great option to get), steering wheel heat and radio controls, back seat heat and radio controls, compass and temp guage, trip computer (tells you more than you want to know), mini-note recorder (never use it, except for taping people's conversations), AM/FM/Casette/CD 290 watt stereo system (standard on the limited.  this is one AMAZING piece of equipment.  One downside, the acoustics in the car are made for the driver and front passenger; therefore, jackin' up the bass really is painful for the backseat passengers.), and carpeted floormats.

Guages are clearly visible.  

A note on the seats.  They have power lumbar, and unlike the seats on the XLS, XLT, and the Eddie Bauer, the headrests on the limited are adjustable.  Very comfortable and VERY spacious.  

Back seat room is super-decent (esp after comparing to other SUVs).  The backseat does look like a truck back-seat, b/c of the empty space beneath the seat.  However, this is just an opportunity for you to increase cargo room.  

Downside of the explorer is it's lack of a giant windshield.   It is TOO close to you.  If it weren't for the moonroof, i'd feel trapped.  The rearview mirror sits comfortably in the middle of the windshield.

Has dual airbags standard, and comes with optional side-impact airbags.  I opted for these b/c i know the rollover rates of SUVs isn't the best.

Power and Utility:
I have the 4.0L V6 SOHC.  It gives 205 hp, 5 hp less than the V8, but this can be increased by about 20 HP by adding a $50 air filter (K&H - definately look into it).

Gas mileage averages 14 MPH city/hw.  But what can you do, it is a truck.

It's a 4x4.  But I keep it 4x2 most of the time.  The on the fly 4x4 is a great thing, especially for Chicago.  Record snowstorms were nothing.  While other people slid and skid, i was in total control with my 4x4 and ABS.  

The turning radius is also amazing.  It was made to go off-road, but it helps me make those sharp U-turns in downtown chicago.

*Optional trailer tow package.
*Optional reverse sensing system.  (Godsend.  I've become so lazy now that i don't even have to look into the rearview mirror.  If a kid runs out, 3 quick beeps.)
*Optional Load-leveling suspension.  (put as much junk as you want in the trunk.  this jacks up the back of the car so it doesn't look weighed down).

RIDE:
a downside if you don't realize the fact that this is a truck.  it is meant to be used as a truck and not a sedan.  It is meant to feel every pothole and every bump.  but while other cars don't have the clearance for some potholes, this one takes them dead-on.

The Verdict:
It is a beautiful truck.  The All-black with the charcoal interior is a SUPER-HARD find, but worth it.  Many people have told me that my particular car looks bigger than other explorers.  I think it's the mono-tone color, the 16" wheels, and the color-keyed fender flares.  It does make the truck stand out.

Interior, it's a chick magnet.  Every girl who has ever been in my truck has fallen in love with me...i mean...it.  The inviting leather seats, the 290 watt stereo system, the moonroof...the super-dark tints, all add to a romantic evening.  
 
The Power...ample.  it's not a sports car..it's a truck..you have to remember that.  Sluggish starts are a part of life, but it has ample HP and good torque to get you there fast enough.

a definite 9.9/10.  The cons are too miniscule to not buy this car.
