            My family has been a Honda family for years.  I drive a Civic, my mom and Accord and now a Civic, and my sister a Civic hatchback.  So when it came time to get my father a new car/truck of course we looked to Honda first.  While preaching good gas mileage and no hassles, my father really wanted something closer to a truck than the old Cavalier he had been driving to save $$.  So when we went to look at the CR-V it seemed like a natural fit.  
The CR-V has an interior much like a (guess-what?) Civic.  It also has some extra features for it's outdoorsy attitude like, a foldout table small icebox built into the trunk space.  Cool.
The gas mileage is good, considering it's almost an SUV.  I drove it for a few days and became a bit attached to it.
So far there has been no complaints or problems - let's see how it handles snow.<br><br>
