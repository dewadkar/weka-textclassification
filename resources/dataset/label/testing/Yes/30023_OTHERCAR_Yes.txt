            I am a picture freak,  at least about taking pictures of my family and friends.  The Kodak DC-280 is the second digital camera that I have owned.  I purchased it because the serial cable for my Olympus digital camera broke off on the tip, and it gave me an 'excuse' to buy a really good camera.  I chose the Kodak for the 2 megapixel resolution, and the digital and optical zoom features.  I wanted a camera that would give me good prints, and in my research, I found that any camera which has at least 1 megapixel resolution would put out decent prints.

I got the camera home, and eagerly loaded the compactflash disc and the batteries, rounded up my children, and began clicking away.  All along I was reading about the different features and got more and more impressed.
You have so many options with this camera, it is very customizable.  You can review the picture you just took immediately, and delete it if you do not want it,(or keep it, and the review will go off in a few seconds) or you can review all your pictures one at a time using either your own timing by pressing a button each time you want to move on to the next pic, or a slideshow set to scroll through your pictures at a rate that you choose (ie: one pic every 10 seconds).  You have quality and resolution options at the click of a button.  I have even used mixed resolutions in one 'setting'.  You can set the flashmode, date stamp, red-eye reduction, balance, and various other features simply and quickly.  

I was very pleased when I uploaded the pictures.  They were beautiful, clear and crisp.  This was a refreshing surprise as I was used to my other camera and the fuzzy shots. (I did not dislike the other camera by any means, they were just not 35mm quality pics).
My camera came with photo printing software.  I was able to print out 5x7's and 8x10's as well a wallet size, various other sizes, create your own sizes, and regular photoshop print size (3x5 and 4x6).  All of these have printed out BEAUTIFULLY!  It's like having a photo studio right at my fingertips. I know that my printer, and photo paper have a little to do with how good my pictures turn out in print, but it starts with the camera, and this one is a great one.

I have also taken these pictures to email, both from files after uploading, and directly from the photo card. They are clear and crisp in email and on the web as well.
My camera came with regular alkaline batteies, and rechargable ones, and a charger. I have dropped it a couple times, and my kids have accidently knocked it off my desk. It's very durable!!! :-)

If you are in to taking pictures and sending them out email, posting them on the web, or printing them out this is a great camera.  I have no complaints at all.
