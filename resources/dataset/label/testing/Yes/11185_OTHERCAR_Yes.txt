            Nowadays, with camera technology advancing ever farther, the laypeople seem to think that the more megapixels your camera's got, the higher quality the picture is.  Well, it is and it isn't.

This camera here, the DX3900 (It hasn't been added to the database yet.) takes 3.3 Megapixel images.  These images end up being bigger than you'd be able to put on nearly any computer desktop.  Why do I need pictures this big?  I'm not doing printing or anything.  I end up having to reduce the pictures down to 25% before they're anywhere close to a size that facilitates me sending them through email.

So, basically, this is the largest megapixel camera you're ever going to want, unless you're going to be printing out the things on photo paper or something...for posters.

If you're looking at something neat to get for your camera, what you're really looking for is optical zoom, and aperture size.

For aperture, the smaller the better.  When you have a smaller number for aperture that means that you keep closer things in focus, and let in more light.  The DX3900 goes from 2.4-4.0 which is pretty darn good.

The DX3900 also has a 2x optical zoom.  Optical is better than digital.  Digital is just the camera trying to figure out what the picture would look like zoomed in more.  Optical is actually using the lenses to reflect the light and zoom in, meaning the end result is the true result of zooming in.

2x zoom isn't much, but the amount of zoom is a directly proportional relationship to to size/length of the lens.  You aren't really going to get something larger than 2x if you don't have a much larger camera.

There are some really nice features on the camera.  You can set up film speed, you can "push" or overexpose the filme to get brighter shots, you can even take burst mode photos.  It drops the resolution down to .8 Megapixels, but this is more of a problem with the limitations of the memory card.  The camera's got to transfer those 8 shots to the flash card in that amount of time it takes you to shoot the photos.

While I'm on the subject of memory, that's another reason I chose this camera.  It doesn't use proprietary memory technology unlike those lamers over at Sony.  The difference between proprietary and public domain technology is a greed issue.  Sony wants to make money on every bit of the camera, while everyone else is satisfied with just selling cameras.  

The end the result to you, the consumer is that you can buy a 64 MB Compact Flash cars for $34, or a 32 MB Memory Stick from Sony for $46.  50% less photos for 35% more money...what a country!

My 64 MB memory card will hold 66 pictures at maximum resolution.  I spent $30 on disposable cameras when I went to Japan, and another $20 on making double prints of them.  On top of that, about 1/3 of my pictures were either undevelopable, or turned out badly.  

So, I figure this digital camera is going to pay for itself rather quickly, and on top of that, I won't ever have to worry about my pictures not coming out ever again.  And I won't have to make multiple prints to give to all my friends.  And if I really need physical copies of the photos, I can always upload my pictures to ofoto.com and print them out there.

Uploading the pictures to your hard drive is a snap.  You can get an "EasyShare" dock for your computer, and do 1-touch transfers, but that's the biggest waste of money I've ever seen.

Simply plug the USB cable to your computer and camera.  Install the software, and turn on your camera.  It'll ask you where you want to save the photos, and voila...pictures saved.  Any photo editing software like Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro will let you crop and otherwise adjust the photos.  No sweat, easy as pie.

The camera isn't prohibitively expensive.  I got the camera, the 64MB memory card, and a 4-battery rapid recharger + plus shipping & tax for $405.  A pretty good deal, I figure.

The camera's small enough to fit in your pocket and carry anywhere.  It comes with cables so you can hook it to your TV and display everything on your big screen if your are so inclined.  A great little camera with all the features you need, and more megapixels than you'll ever need.
