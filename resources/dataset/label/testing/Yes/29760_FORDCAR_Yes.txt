            I have a 97' Explorer Sport.  I have the fully loaded model, so it is like much more like an Eddie Bauer than the entry level model.

The car has been great...it has been very low maintenance, and is fun to drive.

The gas mileage is just ok...  When I purchased it, I was only putting on 600 miles/month, so the mileage seemed very good.  Now, I put on about 300/week, and I wish it could be a little higher.  However, I know what kind of vehicle I have, and I don't blame the vehicle at all.

As far as driving it goes, it drives like a truck and not like a car.  One of my friends has a Grand Cherokee, and that is much more like driving a car.  Personally, I *mostly* love truck-driving-feeling, but it can be an issue when there are other people riding with me (it gets kinda bumpy!)

I've only had one reliability issue with the car: there is a trunk sensor which gets 'damaged' over time, and now, sometimes when I close the trunk, the car doesn't think it is closed.  So, I'll have to close it a few times before it finally gets noticed.  Also, I've had a couple of relatively minor recalls...the worst being that after being in park for awhile (even turned off), the gas pedal sticks when first applied (it is quite noticable).

Overall, a great vehicle...highly recommended.  I would definitely purchase another one.<br><br>
