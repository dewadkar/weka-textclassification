            I bought a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am in 1995 used with 12,000 miles, I paid $12,000 for it.  I kept the car for three years until it had 59,000 miles on it.  We traded it in for a conversion van for more room.  We found the car was roomy enough for four people, it gave us very little trouble with no major repairs.  It rode well and was reasonabaly quiet for a small car.  I think the most surprising thing was that it got 36 miles per gallon of hwy travel.  It had the 3.1 liter V6 and was very peppy around town.  The mileage around town was quite a bit less.  I would recommend the car to anyone who wants a nice car at a reasonable price.  I would not recommend it to older people who want a big roomy car.<br><br>
