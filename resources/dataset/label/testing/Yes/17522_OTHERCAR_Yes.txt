            My beloved 1989 Accord was hit in August 2002.  I had hoped to keep it for another year or so, but after the accident it was nearly a write-off (just bodywork, but it doesn't take much bodywork to write off a car that's only worth $2500), so I donated it to charity and pocketed the insurance check.

I wanted my next car to be another manual transmission sedan.  Those two constraints cut the field down considerably.  I liked the exterior looks of the Infiniti G35, but it wasn't available with a manual transmission when I was shopping (it is now).  I considered an Acura (since my Honda had served me so well), but the TL doesn't come with manual transmission.  Another Accord was a possibility, but I don't like the look of the current series as much as I did the older ones, and besides, I wanted something a little fancier than my last car.

The BMW 3-series starts with a base price of under $30k, which surprised me: before I started shopping, I thought that BMWs were more expensive than that.  A base 325 costs about the same as a loaded Accord.  However, the base BMW is really base -- manually adjusted seats, for instance.  The BMW website has a nice configuration system so you can price out the options.  I ended up getting nearly every one of them, and they all cost money.

The niggling problems mentioned in the "cons" are: the rear speakers would randomly emit hissing noises from time to time.  Also, the little plunger that pops the fuel door cover open got stuck in the "out" position, so I drove around with my fuel door ajar until that was fixed.  The interior sliding cover for the moonroof came off its tracks.  The gas gauge became inaccurate (I ran out of gas with 1/4 tank still indicated -- I managed to get to a gas station, but not all the way to the pump, and I felt like an idiot pushing my fancy new car the last ten feet).  All of these problems were fixed under warranty, and none of them (except the gas gauge, indirectly) affect the driving experience, which is excellent.

The warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles (up from 3/36,000 in 2002) and includes oil changes, wiper blades -- everything except gasoline and tires.

One of the epinions guidelines asks if the car has a "quiet ride".  At cruising speed along the highway, the road and wind noise are pretty low, so it's easy to hold a conversation or for the passenger to nap.  If you drive aggressively, though, the engine and exhaust emit a spine-tingling sound.  Not quiet: <b>better</b> than quiet.

I've had the car for ten months and 12,000 miles now, and I still look for excuses to take it for a spin.  It is an absolute pleasure to drive.
