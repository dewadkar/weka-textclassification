            For the purpose of clarity, this car was purchased and driven in Canada.

Before I made the plunge, I researched the hell out of this car and everything in its class and price range.  My final two came down to the Chrysler Neon and the Hyundai Tiburon.  A test drive made that choice crystal clear.

The Tiburon is classed as a compact car.  You would never guess that to look at it; it's way too sporty.  So to begin with, it's cheap to insure.  It's saving you money right after you buy it.  It also doesn't cost a fortune off the lot.  The options are pretty simple; you pay an extra $1,000 for automatic, a few hundred for leather seats and a few hundred for the SE model.

Purchasing the SE model gives you a power sunroof (yes, a real one), air conditioning, 160W Clarion single disc player, cruise, power locks, 6-way adjustable driver seat, rear window washer/wiper and the distinguished SE spoiler (not the gaudy gigantic one you may have seen on previous years' models).

The 2001 Tiburon is identical in every way to the 2000 with the exception that it is not available in white.


<b>But it's a Hyundai...</b> Yeah, and Ford never made a bad vehicle.  As a matter of fact, with a few minor exceptions, Ford is merely average.  Car and Driver rated the (2000) Tiburon above the Escort ZX2 in almost every category.  I won't plagarize by giving you the details.  A careful shopper will take it upon him or herself to find this out.  Forget what you think you know about Hyundai, you don't know Jack.

<b>It's all looks...</b> Don't you believe it.  The makers of this car put as much thought into the curves of the road as they did into the curves of its body.  It handles like a sportscar.  Its acceleration is right in line with what I would expect of a souped-up inline 4.  The acceleration is also very predictable and smooth, an important and all-too-rare feature.

<b>What about the Civic/Accord etc...?</b> They cost more.  Oh, and this car beats them in road tests.  Don't take my word for it, find out for yourself which vehicle won the last two Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Road Racing competitions.  They've also won twice at Pike's Peak.  There are other reasons not to buy Hondas, but those two convinced me.

</i>Okay, now that I've got your attention, let me tell you what else this car has going for it.</i>

The interior styling is unique.  You're either going to like it or hate it.  It's sure to please the Trekkie in you, but if you don't grok Spock, you might find it a little alien.  At the very least it's functional.  Air vents get the air to all the right places.  I particularly like the ones in the doors that defog your side windows for you.  There is not much space for storing things.  The armrest holds 5 CDs or a CD wallet, and other than that you have nothing more than the skimpy door pockets, which couldn't hold a paperback book.  Good thing the trunk is huge.  There's a reason for the lack of nik-nak holders.  Anything that isn't nailed down is going to fly from one side of the car to the other unless you drive like a granny.

I have leather.  The simple reason is that there was no reason not to.  It didn't add that much to the cost of the car and it is <i>so</i> comfortable.  Just go to the dealership and sit in it.  Ahhhh...

I chose the SE model, again because it didn't cost that much more than the base model.  I also don't like the base model's drooping spoiler.  It seems to say, "I'm sad because I can't afford the SE model."  Besides, I love a sunroof in the summertime.

I drive an automatic.  I suppose that, as shoppers for sporty compacts go, I'm in the minority.  Most are looking for a car that's fun to drive, and for those people manual shifting is a part of that experience.  I still find mine fun to drive, I just prefer to have both hands on the wheel.  Or better yet, one hand on the wheel and one hand on the girl.  In fact, if they could invent a car that I can drive with my mind and keep both hands free, I'd be a happy, happy man.  Acceleration does not suffer in the automatic.  Overdrive is selectable at the shifter.  With the pedal down, shiftpoints are just a hair under the redline.

<i>Some other points I'd like to add:</i>

I heard a strange rattling noise soon after I bought the car.  I solved the problem by stopping the car, putting it in park, and spending the change I had stored in the coin holder.  Oops, I guess coins rattle.  Everything else on this car is solid as a rock.  No vibration, no rattle, nothing.  Even the fan is quieter than I'm used to.

I'm 5'8" and I had headroom issues until I reclined the seat a little.  I'm guessing that taller people just have to recline the seat more, but sooner or later you're going to run out of arm and won't be able to reach the wheel.  Of course, you'd find this out on a test drive wouldn't you?

Your friends will not fit comfortably in the back.  There just isn't enough head or leg room.  But who cares what they think anyway, they're the losers who don't have a ride of their own.  Let them suffer.  If they complain, just say, "Shut up, it can't be uncomfortable, it's leather!"  It's fine for a short ride, but bad for road trips.

Have I convinced you yet?  Go and drive it for yourself.

<b>UPDATE APRIL 2001</b>

I've had my car in for its 6,000 km service and what can I tell you?  I still love it as much as the day I bought it.  Its first scratch is a ding dead center on the hood, a rock off the freeway being the culprit.  I also had to replace the windshield after only 3,000km due to yet another rock.  My tires were vandalized at less than 1,000km.  Replacements were hard to find.  Michelin dealers don't have them, you'll need to go and see your local Acura dealer.  The Integra uses the same Michelin tire.  Or if you prefer, I'm pretty sure the Mazda Miata uses a Yokohama performance tire of the same size.

There was a noise coming out from under the dash on cold mornings, which I can only describe as "gurgling."  I found the solution by doing a search at Google for "gurgling 2001 Tiburon".  Go figure, eh?  If you're having this problem with your Tibby, go to www.hyundaiowners.com and browse the forums.  Alex has posted a very complete problem/solution reply to a customer's complaint.  To summarize, the throttle cable is rattling against the air intake pipe.  That vibration is travelling through the throttle cable, to the speedometer cable, to the meter in the dash, and presto, gurgling noise!  You stop the vibration using foam insulation used by plumbers.  It worked like a charm.
