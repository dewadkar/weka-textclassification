                  I purchased my 2000 Chevy Silverado 1500 pick-up about six months ago and I am completly satisfied by it performance.  Before I bought this truck I owned a 1992 Ford Bronco, although this is still my favorite sport utility I am much happier with the my Chevy.  My truck has an extended cab with the four doors and for a pick-up truck it has plenty of room in the back seat for two of my full grown friends to sit comfortably, and room for three of them to sit although they may be a little of a tight fit.  My truck is a two wheel drive with the smaller V-8 at 4.8 litters but it rides smooth and has plenty of power and exceleration.  
      Before purchasing this vehicle I spent alot of time comparing it to the Ford F150, Toyota Tundra, and Dodge Ram 1500.  All of the trucks priced right about in the same range when they were equipt with the same features.  The Chevy sits the lowest to the ground but I found that it was the largest and the heavist.  This gives you more room in the back seat, and due to the extra wieght I felt that I had more control over the back wheels, expecially in the rain.  The Ford F150 had the most torque but it was not as smooth as the Chevy.  The Toyota I disqualified immidiatly, not only was it the most expensive but it was also the smallest and to me size matters.  The Dodge was big and mean looking but I felt it didnt handle well out on the road.
     The interior is not only roomy but it is also very classy and clean looking.  The stock stereo system sounds good, and features such as the automatic lights and keyless entry are nice too have.  The back seat was more comfortable to sit in because it is slanted back instead of upright making it more laid back, and the seat can also easily be folded up to give you more ground storage space.
     I have made a couple of alterations to my truck since I purchased it.  I added a sub-woofer under the back seat and when combined with the stock speaker it makes a really nice sound.  I pulled the paneling off the side of the truck which I think made the truck look smoother, and surprisingly came off very easily with the aid of a house-hold blow drier.  And finally I added a speed grill, chrome Chevy sign, and clear coners to give the front end a sportier look.  I don't think that these alterations are necessary but I chose to do this to customize it to my own taste.
     Overall I think that this is a quality truck and although it is a little on the high side cost wise if you can afford it I definitly recomend it.<br><br>
