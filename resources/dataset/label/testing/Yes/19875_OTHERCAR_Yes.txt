            I received my C30 as a Mother's Day gift in 1999.  I love taking pictures and this seemed like a great money saver.  We got a $100 rebate from HP when we purchased the camera and a printer at the same time.  This gave us a final cost of about $250 for the camera.

My camera has an 8MB mini disc that allows up to 80 pictures on the low-quality setting.  I usually have mine set for mid-quality and get 40 pictures.  

I download the pictures using the camera as the drive.  After printing the pictures or saving them, I delete the pictures from the disc in the camera.  I have used and used one 8MB card and have taken well over 500 pictures with the camera.

A small window in the back allows for instant viewing of pictures, either as a slide show, one at a time or small photo index.  The slide show is fun to use when connecting the camera to a TV with a cable provided.  The small photo index allows you to skip to a photo that didn't quite turn out properly and delete that photo.

The camera has auto focus, red eye reduction, auto flash and a timer feature.  You can also do real time viewing in the viewing window for an action shot.  It also has a 2x zoom.

Our camera also included a full version of Picture It! software.<br><br>
