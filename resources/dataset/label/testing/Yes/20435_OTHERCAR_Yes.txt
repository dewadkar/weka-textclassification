            After my Mustang GT hit 185,000 miles, I decided to finally purchase another automobile.  

I had no idea what kind of car I wanted.  I don't have a whole lot of interest in cars.  I am somewhat partial towards American cars, but there weren't any that seemed to fit.

My friend from graduate school had purchased a Passat, which I liked.  I knew I didn't want to spend $20,000 to buy a Passat, but I knew the Jetta cost a little less.  I had also heard it was highly rated.

I did a little information gathering on the internet - I went through Cars.com, which e-mailed my Jetta query to a dealership 4 miles from my workplace.  The salesman e-mailed me that they did have a brand new 2000 Jetta, and that he'd let me have it for $250 over invoice.

I test drove and bought it all in the same day.  I don't like spending a whole lot of time shopping, and I could tell right away that it is a quality car.  

Why I bought it:
- Although it's not a large car, it drives like a large car.  It hugs the road, and is very quiet.  The salesman told me that it's a good 400 lbs. more than the Honda Accord.
- Going from an 8-cylinder engine to a 4-cylinder caused me to pause, but the car moves very well.  Acceleration is very good, even up steep hills.  It's not a Mustang GT, but then since most of my driving is city driving, I don't really miss the large engine (or the poor gas mileage I got in the Mustang).  
- I'm a fairly large guy - I'm 6'3&quot;, around 225 lbs., athletic build.  I had concerns that my head would be hitting the ceiling of the car, or that my shoulders/elbows would be restricted.  Not the case.  Since the Jetta is a German car, it's built with larger individuals in mind.
- Room - the trunk is enormous, although remember that I'm comparing it to my Mustang trunk, which couldn't hold a suitcase.  Still, I can't imagine a car with much more trunk room.  The high rear end of the car provides the trunk with good depth, and the rear seats can be folded down so that additional room can be used.  The trunk contains a real tire jack and a full sized spare tire.  
- Sound system - the Monsoon sound system is exceptional.  The salesman threw in the 6 CD changer in for free, otherwise I would have paid extra for it because music is important to me.  I've listened to CD's I had for years in the car, and I'm astonished to hear things that I've never heard before because of the quality of the car's sound system.  At times, I've stayed in the car after parking it to hear the end of a favorite song, it sounds so good in the car.  The CD player is neatly hidden away in the trunk in a special pocket to prevent it from being jarred or seen by a casual thief.
- Antilock brakes/air conditioning/front and side airbags/anti-theft system are standard.  I liked that I didn't have to make a decision on adding these - they're all standard.

The only thing so far I didn't like (and it's very small) is that when the car has snow on the roof, it falls all over the seat when I open the door.  
  
I am very satisfied with my 2000 VW Jetta.  <br><br>
