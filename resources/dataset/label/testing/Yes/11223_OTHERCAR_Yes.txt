            I am a Pastor I live 42 miles from the church I pastor my family rides with me and the van is very comfortable. The van runs well,and it's driven every day. We get good gas mileage 300 miles per tank of gas.However,we have some engine smoke when idling 100,000 miles had some transmission problems had them fixed. That's our 93 van. The new Chrysler town &amp; country is well designed has more seating and head space it drives well in all weather fun to drive a lot of windows sit high can see the road.We like instrument panel the suspension give us a great ride.Braking system is the best I have had to use. I like the interior and exterior and all the extras. I do recommend the Chrysler town &amp; country to large and on the go families like ours you will enjoy your investment.<br><br>
