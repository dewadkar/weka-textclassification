            When my husband and I found out that we were expecting triplets, we decided that it was time to break down and buy a *family* car. We shopped around for several weeks and finally decided on the Ford Windstar.

I was very surprised that it drove like a regular car and not a van. It has a powerful V6, 3.8 engine and gets moving fast. It is ranked number 1 in safety, according to the National Highway Safety Department. 

When our triplets were born, their infant car seats were a perfect fit in addition to my toddler sons' car seat. There is plenty of room for both twin strollers and all the accessories that I take with me, everywhere I go. 

We have taken a few road trips and have been very happy with our comfort level and the smooth ride. The only disappointment is that the gas mileage is not what we expected. We get about 18 miles to the gallon on the highway. 

The maintenance on the van has been very low and we have not had and problems. I would recommend the Ford Windstar to any family that needs more room, comfort and reliability!<br><br>
