            I wanted to get a camera that would be good to take internet pictures with and plus I just got a new nephew and neice that I love and adore. Well, I went out and bought one of those Jam Cam's and I didn't like it at all. It took crapey pictures and I couldn't use it for anything. I just bought it because the comercials made it look great.
   Well, for my b-day my grandma,(wich I also love) went in with my aunt and bought me the Fuji Film Mx-1200 camera. I started using it that day and I loved it. It isn't cheap,(depending on what your price range is) but it does the job just perfectly. I love this camera. Nothing can be better. It takes clear pictures, it's user friendly so to speek, and it's small with lots of room on the cards. Needless to say, my web page has bean promoted because of my pictures and I have more memories of my famly. I would recomend this camera to anyone that wants a camera that gets the picture taken the way they want it.<br><br>
