             I looked at several different styles of cars, but my passion was for the Xterra.  I just liked the looks of it.  As I progressed during my shopping I found out that the Nissan Xterra was Motor Trends' SUV of the Year, outbeating Explorer,Excursion,RAV4, and even its cousin the Pathfinder.  Nissan proposed the Xterra as an alternate to the No. 1 SUV, the pathfinder, but the in my opinion I get the feeling that the Xterra will surpass the Pathfinder for the next few years.  To buy the Xterra is for the image and the value.  If you don't like the looks, you should just stop there.  But if your still with me about this odd little SUV, I think your on the right track.  I'm no grease-monky, so I can't explain the what has that makes it a great vehicle.  But I can tell you this, when you hit the gas pedal and different terrian(dirt,gravel,payment) you can feel the power this &quot;compact-SUV&quot; has.  The seats are what they should be, and all the necessities are there.  If you need vanity mirrors try Cadillac or Lexus, this baby is for the simple.  Buying Xterra joins into one of those car cults, where your just in awe of seeing another one around; so just like corvette, jeep, and the beetle there is pure enjoyment from owning this fun SUV.<br><br>
