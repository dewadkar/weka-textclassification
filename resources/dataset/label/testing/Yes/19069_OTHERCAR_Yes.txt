            Anyone can save mega bucks by using this camera.  I used to shoot roll after roll of 35mm film using my single reflex GAF camera only to find that I didn't like the results after paying to get my film developed. Oh sure, I did make some beautiful shots which I was able to sell, but since I have owned my Olympus Digital C2020Z I it's a brand new world opened up to me.  With the digital camera, aside from the obvious savings of not having to buy roll after roll of film and dishing out the dollars for processing the same, with the assist of your computer one is able to crop your images yielding the optimal shots. Since you are able to shoot hundreds upon hundreds of pictures on one memory disc you can shoot all day limited only by the battery life.  I have gone for a photo shoot and discovered that my battery was in need of charging. Since it was about lunch time I went to a diner and plugged the charger unit in and by the time lunch was over the batteries were ready for the afternoon shoot.  One nice thing about this camera is it's size. I have the entire camera and all the accessories contained in a camcorder carrying bag and still have room for my 10x hand held binoculars and second digital camera that I allow others to use on site. All the cables and power lines fit nicely in a pouch about the size of the camera itself. As for the cameras performance,  you can shoot adjusting the quality of the pixel output and take advantage of the Zoom.  The use of the monitor screen to review your work will allow you to verify you got the shot you actually tried to get, however with the bigger memory disc I suggest that you shoot away and edit later. Don't be worried about the bad shots they can be easily deleted. You might prefer to do as I do and review your images when your camera is plugged into an A.C. power source thus saving your batteries. For the candid shots I have covered the red power on light which is positioned on the front of the camera. This gives way to a more natural shooting from your subjects.  If you are after spy type shots, as are many webers, the red light being covered is a must. However, with it covered and with the handy remote control the photo can obtain great candid shots totally unaware of the subject. The camera can have a beep go off or it can be turned off for the candid shots. This is a real plus for the camera shy models. They are totally unaware that the camera is capturing images. If you are interested in seeing some shots from this camera you may visit a web page that I developed. All the images were taken using my Olympus C2020Z.
