            I purchased my 1999 2WD Ford Ranger about 3 months ago.  I haven't had a problem with it yet.  Even though the only options it came with were an automatic transmission and Cruise Control, it feels like a truck with the full package.
     Not only is the interior extremely comfortable, the positioning of controls and inside devices make this truck so easy and fun to drive.  And  the drive is nice and smooth.  In addition, the 4 cyl. engine is very &quot;peppy&quot; and not gutless.  Since I have the automatic version,  I can shift into Low 1 or 2 in order to get more power up hills or in the event of towing.  Yes, this little truck tows well and is not daunted by moving heavy items in the bed.
     I whole-heartedly suggest the Ford Ranger (any model) to drivers, even those Chevy loyalists.<br><br>
