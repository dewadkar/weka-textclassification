            I wanted a simple digital camera for taking quality pictures of items to sell on EBAY and the occasional family/friend event that warrants a web page of photos to share.  The Olympus 340-R at approximately $300 was a great deal more camera than I expected.  I originally wanted to get a Sony FD-xx Mavica with floppy drive, but I'm not about to pay $500 for the floppy drive feature alone, the Sony's are way overpriced for the quality these days.  

As others have stated, the Olympus is a great little camera.  Very easy to use and with the 8 meg flash card, it can take about 120 pictures at its lowest resolution (and very suitable for web publishing).  The built-in flash just works and fires at the right time, the macro focus is useful for my ebay photos, and the overrides lets you play around with sample shots.  The LCD view screen is better than many of the $500+ cameras and makes shooting photos a snap.  I didn't bother getting anything fancy to download the photos, the serial cable and software provided do a fine job of previewing the photos on the camera and picking the ones that you want to download (or just dumping them all to a folder and sorting later).

The camera uses 4 AA size batteries, I recommend buying a couple sets of rechargeables.  

Sample photos I took with this camera can be seen at:

The first 3 photos are basically the same shot using the normal, hq and shq photo quality settings.  (With an 8Mbyte flash card, the camera will take 122 of the normal quality photos)
