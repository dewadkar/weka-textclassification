            This camera takes EXCELLENT quality digital photos.  The controls can be somewhat intimidating because there are so many different choices of settings.  The manual is quite easy to understand though.

I use a stand-alone reader for the SmartMedia memory card, and would highly recommend that one be purchased when the camera is purchased.  This method is so much faster and handier than downloading pics to your PC via a cable.

The camera's biggest drawbacks are its short battery life and the lack of usability of the display screen outdoors.  I find myself using the optical viewfinder almost exclusively when shooting pics outdoors, even though the optical viewfinder doesn't zoom to match the lens.<br><br>
