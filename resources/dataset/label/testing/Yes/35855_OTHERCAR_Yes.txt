            I purchased a 1995 Chevy Lumina in March of 1998.  It was high in mileage, 67000, but just came off of a 3 year lease, so I figured it would be in peak condition. Just in case, I bought a warranty.  
Well, it is now Oct. of 2000, 83000 miles, and I am happy to say I have had few problems.  

During this time I had to get the internal manifold casket replaced.  In addition, I needed to replace the water pump.  Outside of this, NO PROBLEMS.  Most everything else has been basic maintenance.  For instance, I needed to get the front calipers cleaned, a problem the dealer told me was common on these cars, but cheap to do.  I have run into a few electrical problems, also common with 95's, but nothing detrimental. They have included a trick right blinker, a sticky door lock, and an occasional problem with the drivers side electronic window control.  Everything I can live with.

Throughout all of this the car rides like it is on a cushion of air.  I have always been impressed with the smooth ride and have received compliments from others.  Also, the gas  mileage is very economical and the pep is GREAT.  Tap the accelerator and you GO GO GO!!!  It packs the punch of an eight cylinder.  Pick up is amazing.

Although some may consider the Lumina to be a large car, I find it sleek and stylish.  Also, having the frame of a football player and long legs I find the extra room extra appreciated.  

I have no desire to get rid of the car until I absolute have to.

If you have the opportunity, now that the car has been discontinued, I recommend to give it a spin.
