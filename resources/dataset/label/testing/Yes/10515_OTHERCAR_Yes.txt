            The 2000 Acura TL is a fantastic auto and provides many high end options not expected of a car in the $30,000.00 range.  The Acura easily outperforms other cars in its category and the new 5 speed shifting option lets you go from automatic to stick with a flick of the shifter.

The Acura comes loaded with the only option being a navigation system through Acura.  I have it and it is great ($2,000 option).  Multi disc player is an option through dealer.

Standard features-
Leather, Automatic, Sunroof, Alloy Wheels, Bose sound System, Heated seats, Power seats,  5 speed auto/manual shifting <br><br>
