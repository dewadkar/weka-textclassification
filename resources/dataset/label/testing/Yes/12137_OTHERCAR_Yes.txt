            I have had my honda prelude for close to three years now, I bought it single owner used with around 50k on it and it now has over 80k on it.  Nothing has gone wrong on this car, I am very pleased.  

You will not find a car with this kind of performance for the price period.  Just try it, eclipse, miata, celica, the prelude takes them all hands down.  And on top of that the car does not die.  

The car is absolute fun to drive, it handles wonderfully although the weight distribution is a little too front heavily(70/30 i believe).  Mine is lowered about two inches and it handles almost twice as good as stock.  

At idle the car is very quiet and virtually vibration free.  

I have found the brakes to be a little weak, another 15 feet in stopping distance would be nice.

Don't plan on seating anyone in the back its purely a cosmetic feature.  Also 93 was the year that you get gipped on the center console, so there is virtually no storage space in the cabin and definitly no cup holders.  

If you are in the market for a prelude take a pass on the S edition, tiny engine, smaller wheels, its just not worth owning.  I also had a 92 prelude Si before this one(it met an unfortunate end) so I can tell you the power difference is very noticeable between the si and vtec.

Make sure you put good tires on this car(and any car too) its worth the money.
