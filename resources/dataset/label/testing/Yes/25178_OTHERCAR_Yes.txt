            Well, after shopping around, I just went out and bought a Protege ES, loaded. I compared it with Civic, Sentra, Corolla, and Saturn SL2.

Here's what I liked about it:
(1) I got it for a great price. With the $1K rebate, I paid $500 under invoice. They aren't marketed very well, and you can get them for a song.
(2) Dependable Japanese design. Basically comparable to Civic and Corolla, but better value initially. Civics and Corollas hold their value a little better, but I drive cars for 6-7 years, so that was less of an issue (for me).
(3) Fun to drive. If you're looking for a fun to drive (peppy engine, good suspension, wide 15&quot; wheels, etc.) but still practical Japanese compact car, here's what you'll find: Corollas are cushy and relaxing, but not zippy and fun. Civics are only a little better, except for the Si. The Sentras are underpowered except for the SE. (More on the Civic Si and the Sentra SE below.) And, of course the Protege ES, with a 122HP engine, a nice stiff suspension and good handling, and 15&quot;x6&quot; alloy wheels. The premium package also nets you a sunroof, which is more fun. BTW, the Protege ES is a lot peppier with a manual instead of an automatic transmission. Also, the manual is geared to give you more RPMs, so it revs higher (and is a little noisier) than, for example, a Corolla.
(4) Safe. Dual second-generation airbags were standard, and the premium package nets you ABS and side-impact airbags. It also handles well enough to help you avoid accidents in the first place.
(5) Surprisingly roomy (for its class). I'm a pretty big guy, and I'm usually pretty cramped in the back seat of a compact car. Heck, even in the front seat of a current-model Corolla or Saturn. I felt perfectly comfortable in the back seat of the Protege, and even had enough legroom. Of course, if your rear-seat passengers aren't small children, it's still a 4-person car.

After doing my initial survey, I had things narrowed down to the Honda Civic Si, the Nissan Sentra SE, and the Protege ES. The Civic Si is a pretty serious pocket rocket, with 160 horses under the hood. It's also new to the 2000 model year, and selling like hotcakes. The dealer nearest me told me they had a few coming in and all of them were presold. Translation: if you want one, you're going to pay every dime of the MSRP ($17,500). I was able to test drive one at another dealer, but I couldn't justify the $3K difference. If you test drive one in 6 months, after things have cooled down, you may be able to get a better deal: if so, this may be the car.

The Sentra SE is also a nifty little car. It's got 140HP, with the engine and suspension of the 200SX SE-R, an amateur stock-car racing staple. The 2000 is coming out redesigned in March, so right now, there are only 1999s on the lot. Sentras are also sales-challenged, so there are good deals on these as well. I liked that the Proteges were more roomy, I liked the interior and exterior styling better, and I could get side-impact airbags on it. I was also able to find a better selection of colors to choose from in the Protege, since there were only a couple of 1999 Sentra SEs in a 300-mile radius still for sale. If you're looking to buy a new car in March 2000 or after, I highly recommend you strongly consider this car as well.

Still, given the price issues with the Civic Si, and the limited availability of the 1999 Sentra SE, the Protege made sense for me. It's too early to say anything about the reliability, but so far, it's an awful lot of fun to drive.<br><br>
