            This is the second Digital camera that I have purchased. I do like the product a lot. It is easy to operate, even my 9 year did operate this camera when he was barely 8.
I have used this camera for a lot of different occasions. I helped my youngest son's baseball coach out by taking pictures of all the games so he could compile a scrapbook for each child. I used 20 disks for the season and very few were not used.
What is nice about this product is that after you take a picture, you can view it right away to see if it will be serviceable or not - if not you can take another picture immediately.
Digital cameras are a way to go - no more purchasing of film or paying for developing and you can download it into any program on your computer -very easy.
I teach school. I am an art teachers in a small rural community. For my kindergarten ( i see around 46 students) and I take there picture and we use in in their art project. I have made a calendar with their pictures imported in there. This is very inexpensive for me and I can play with the designs until I get it the  way I want it.
I have also used it for taking pictures of the different elementary plays and have printed it out for the music teacher. We got to display them the next day.
I like the camera. Some day I hope to upgrade my model, but for know It serves my purpose of what I need to do.
The camera is very easy to operate. I just charge the battery the night before I need to use the camera.The zoom is pretty good on the camera, I can get pretty close pictures being at a distance.<br><br>
