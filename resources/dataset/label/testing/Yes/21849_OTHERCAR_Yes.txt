            I have owned the V40 for about 4 months now, and put about 5,000 miles on it.
My overall experience has been very positive. Don't listen to the reviewers that
wrote a review based on a test drive.

My buying experience was mediocre at best, but I won't get into that here, I
will see if the dealer is listed elsewhere on the site and post there.

I did a lot of research before making this purchase, I needed space for my growing 
family, but I couldn't bring myself to drive a resource hogging SUV. Safety was a 
high priority for me, and Volvo is the first name that comes to mind when you talk 
about safe cars.

I decided on an Atlantic Blue V40 with the Cold Weather package, the cool
wheels and the wood grain trim. I didn't actually want the wood grain trim, but 
in order to get the other options I had no choice. 

I find that the cockpit is generally well designed. I am a big guy, 6+ feet tall and well
over 200 pounds, and I have plenty of head, leg, and waist room. The controls are well
designed and all within reach, the only one that is a pain is the stereo volume control,
it tends to hide behind my knee. The windshield and dash board are the home to two of 
the nits that I have to pick with this car. When we first picked it up the glare from the light tan
dash was very obvious in the windshield. It was only enough to be mildly aggravating, but if you are 
going into or out of a parking deck or tunnel it was pretty bad. It seems to have faded a bit, or I have gotten 
used to it, I'm not sure. The other nit is that being just over 6 feet tall I have to duck my head to see an 
overhead traffic light if I am the first person in line. My wife, who is 5'4" doesn't have this problem.

One of the things that I love about this car is the dichotomy inherent in trying to be a safe wagon 
and be a bit sporty. I think it does this pretty well. If you test drive it you will notice that the 
pick up time is less then stellar for the first few seconds. Then BAM! The turbo charger kicks in and you 
are thrown back in your seat. It takes some getting used to. Once you are moving the sporty-ness is obvious,
you can go from 60 to 100 in no time flat. Passing on the highway is a breeze. Tight corners are a lot of 
fun, my only complaint in the sporty department is the seats. Occasionally I get to drive it on a twisty back road
without my wife or the kids in the car and I really turn it up. 90MPH hair pin turns, the works. The V40 takes it all in stride.
But when I am doing that I have a tendency to slide around in the seat a bit more then I would like. Since this is in fact 
a family wagon, and not a sports car, I think that that can be forgiven.

I think that the safety features speak for themselves, and you can find a list of them on Volvos website. Not many other
cars in this price range are as concerned with your safety as Volvo, and in the end that is what is important when you are buying a car to transport your family. 

I haven't had a chance to use the features included in the Cold Weather package; traction control, heated seats, and a few 
others that escape me at the moment. I will add to this in the coming months to include how it handles itself in the snow that
will be a nearly every day occurrence in a couple of months here in the North East.

If you have any specific questions about this car and want a straight answer about them, drop me a not and I will
do my best to answer them.
