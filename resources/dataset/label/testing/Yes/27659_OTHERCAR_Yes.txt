            When I first walked onto the lot of the used car dealership, I wasn't expecting to get a great car for the small amount of money I had.  Especially when I saw the little Hyundai Accent that would end up being mine.  I honestly thought that this car wouldn't last a week.  But I didn't have a choice, I needed a car.  Wow, am I glad I was wrong!  

This car runs BEAUTIFULLY!  In the two years that I have owned it, I have not taken it to the shop once.  It is amazingly quick and handles well.  The inside if the car is very comfy, and more spacious than you think just by looking at it.  This car is great for a college student, or somebody who is short on cash.  I recommend this car to anybody who needs reliable transportation!  Really, I can't think of any bad things about this car.  When it is time for me to buy a new car, I will definitely be going with Hyundai.<br><br>
