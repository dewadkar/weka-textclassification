            I bought the SE model with every possible option (sunroof, spoiler etc) over a year ago and I love it.  This is my first new car and after driving unreliable used cars for the past 10 years I feel so safe and secure driving this car.  

I had a great experience at the dealership I selected (after going to 3 different Nissan dealerships in my area).  The first 2 were the "oh look a girl" kind .. very condescending.  They had the color and model I wanted and gave me what I was looking for on my trade in (the others laughed at my expected trade in value).  

The car drives great.  No problems at any level &#150 high speeds, hills, etc.  No rattling noises, quiet ride, great stereo and cd player.  I have not had a problem yet with this car.  There are a few small things that occasionally pop-off in the interior &#150 some little cover on the floor of the passenger side ( I couldn&#146t figure out why it was there anyway so just left it off) and the 12 V DC caps (there are 2) fall off a lot.  

There is not a lot of leg room in the back for passengers and even with the seats folded down don&#146t expect to be able to move large items because of the curved doors and trunk it&#146s hard to maneuver the items into the car.  

I have a larger dog that likes to jump around a lot and the interior has held up wonderfully.  No scratches or rips anywhere.  My next new car will also be a Nissan.
