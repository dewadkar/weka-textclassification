            It is a definite reality but it is like driving in a fantasy!
When I first saw it in 2000, the over all looks caught my attention.  The idea of a full size SUV & pickup truck bed was intriguing.  At the time I was driving a 1999 Ford Ranger 4x4.  Of course I loved that truck for many reasons, but I needed something with more power, and room inside.
I Went and took a test drive at the end of 2000 and literally fell in love with it.  Five months later I purchased my 2001 Ford f-150 Supercrew XLT 4x4.  Ever since then, I have enjoyed driving my truck.  It is so quiet!
I couldn't believe the smooth ride it has, just like driving a luxury car!  When you hit a bump it is almost like you never hit it.  Excellent braking @ any speed, well with in the speed limits of course!  
I love the room it has to offer inside.  Not only is the front spacious for driving all the time but the back is comfortable for a grown adult.  No cramp feel what so ever.  The engine is very powerful, sporting a 5.4liter v8, w/ great acceleration, towing and over all driving. [example of towing:  I went to the beach one day, and while driving I saw a Chevy suburban 4x4 stuck up to the wheel wells in the soft area of sand.  So I drove over to him, and he asked me if I could help get him out.  I backed up, hooked up a tow strap, put it in 4x4 low and pulled him out in less than 5 seconds.]  That is what I call some power!  
Handling is definitely excellent for a large truck, on the road and off the road.
Before I went out and bought my Supercrew, I did much research on it.  I looked for the color, model, options I wanted and which dealership would give me the best deal.  
Which I would recommend this to any one to do first before whipping out their check book. 
(Make sure you are getting exactly what you want!)
It is definitely worth it.
I could have driven off the lot with one closest to what I want, but I stuck to my list, did a locate and found a truck with everything I wanted and even more options.
This truck has definitely met my expectations and more.
I would recommend this to every guy, and women who want a stylish & reputable, long lasting truck, safe on the road, seats 5-6 people and still offers the amenities of an SUV & gives you the availability of a truck bed.

Back in February of this year, I took my truck on it's first long road trip.  For a 2,700 mile round trip!!
It was unbelievable.  I will have to back up what I wrote above in January, and say that it is still a 5 star truck!!
For such a long trip, a lot of people would be more quick to pick a car to drive instead of a truck.  After driving my truck, I would definitely do a road trip again.
It still proves to be a quiet and comfortable ride despite its truck appearance.
The engine handled very well through out the entire trip.  Not a single problem arose.
As for gas mileage, although it is a sucker, I used cruise control most of the time and stayed at 70 mph to help save gas.
At the end I came out with spending a little over 200.00 in gas, averaging about 20 miles per gallon.
I would have to say it was one of the best,if not THE Best trip I have taken.

With spring here and Summer just around the corner, I have a lot planned for my truck!!
Plus I am going to take another road trip, almost 1,400 mile round trip to Montana in June.
