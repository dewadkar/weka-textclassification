            I had a neon and it just was not big enough, finally after packing myself into the smaller vehicle for about 2 years I decide I had had enough and went shopping for something bigger.  The Dodge caravan was just what I needed.  I do not have kids to haul around anymore but I could never be considered a small guy and the extra leg room was just what the doctor ordered.  And the cargo space, I can haul just as much in the back of my caravan as I can in my pickup truck and keep it dry at the same time.  So a van does more than haul just people it gives you freedom to move more for less.<br><br>
