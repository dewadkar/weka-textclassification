            I just recently purchased a Ford Escort and it is the second Escort I've owned.  I just love the car.  Its not fancy, it gets great gas mileage, and it blends into the crowd.  So if you are looking for a car that really stands out, this is probably not the car for you.  

I have never had any problems with my new Escort and my old '95 Escort never had a problem either.  I do a lot of back and forth driving and the Escort is perfect for that kind of travel, it gets decent miles to the gallon.  I get around 30.  

What I like best about this car is that for a compact it has more leg room then a lot of the other cars I tested.  I test drove a Chevy Cavilier and it was a little bit cheaper, but I ended up buying the Escort because of the fact the car feels more open and has more leg room.  I'm not one of those people who likes really compact cars, I sort of feel like I'm suffacating, but the Escort has a really breezy feel to it.  I must admit it is a pretty boring car, but it gets me from place to place without breaking down and that's all I really ask for.<br><br>
