                 Ok, This IS the most candid and honest review for this camera that you will read. Before I tell you my story about my relationship with this fantastic little camera, let me set up my credentials. I have been working in the television field for about 6 years now. I am a videographer/ audio technician and I have used ALL sorts of expensive (I'm talking cameras worth $50,000) and specialized photography/video equipment throughout my carrer.  So, with that said.. on to the review.

     About 5 months ago I was looking around for a digital camera. I own a wonderfull Cannon SLR and a Pentax IQzoom 160, both very nice 35 mm cameras, but they are not digital. My reason for even wanting a digital was to save on developing costs. I am the kind of fool who loves to document everything, and I would always have my SLR on hand to just capture the moment. Well, capturing the moment also meant emptying my wallet every time I wanted to SEE the pictures I had taken.  Instead of building my own film developing lab, I figured the cheaper option was to purchase myself a nice, easy to use, "not affraid to take it anywhere" digital camera. 

     After MUCH, MUCH research, I had my heart set on a SONY P7. Now, this was just before the P9 came out so the price of the P7 was about $599.  I was Actually purchasing this camera at a best buy, with all the accesories (128 mb STICK, new NP battery, bag.. all the crap the guy talked me into) when, thank GOD, my credit card would not work at the register. I was upset at the time,  cause I wanted a camera so bad, but im glad I did'nt spend the $750 I was going to.
 
     After my credit card incident I forgot about getting a camera until about a month later. I was at Costco, just cruzin down the electronics isle, (I wasnt actually going to buy anything in electronics, I just like to check out the new crap that they get.) and I passed a pile of Digital cameras, all nicely displayed and ready to go. I take a closer look. Price? $150 . Megapixels? 2.2  batteries? it takes 4 AA. Does it have a lens cap? yes.  I picked it up and started really looking at it.  The smartmedia card that it came with was a joke, 8 mb, enough for 7 pictures at the highest res, but that did not concern me. here are the main things I was considering right before I ended up purchasing this camera. 
- It has an LCD. $150 camera with an LCD!? Wow. 
- Yea, it takes 4 AA, but the cost of one spare SONY bat 
  was almost as much as the memory stick. $80! 
- It had a lens cap. Crucial for maintenance of the lens
- There are minimal buttons and dials. Transalates to 
  easier and quicker use. 
- It's 2.2MP!! I mean, for this price. Its an amazing
  value! 
- It has video out, so you can watch pictures on a tv.
- It's got a flash. duhh.  
- THE PRICE!!  it's just so cheap with so many options.
 
     At this point I was convinced. I am buying this camera. A month ago I was going to spend over $700 for that Sony, and this Toshiba has all the same options for 1/4 of the cost. NOW, about the memory.. I can't survive with an 8mb card. I looked next to the pile of cameras, guess what I saw. Ahh, Costco has made it so convienient. A PILE OF 128 mb memory  cards!  AND the price for one of these puppies was $50!!!!  UNREAL! so for about $200 I have a 2.2MP camera!
  
     I have  owned the camera for about 5 months. and have taken over 600 pictures with it. here are the juicy details.
 
- With the 128 mb card, and the camera in it's FULL RES
  position, it can take 133 pictures before the card fills
  up. THATS a lot of pictures.  
- WITH 4 regular Duracell AA bats, AND the LCD off.. the
  camera will take all 133 pics and the batteries will
  still have a little below 1/3 their power. This includes
  the flash firing on approx half the shots. 
- The optical zoom is just fine. I turned the digital zoom
  off, its really unessecary. 
- It's got a little hand strap, Cute. 
- It feels solid, not like a Kodak digital camera, with
  it's cheap plasticy feel and creaky joints. 
- The program it comes with to upload it to the computer is
  very quick and easy to use. Pictures load nicely, and
  then I can clear the card. I would suggest using the
  cameras own CARD CLEARING function. When I tried to
  delete all the pictures while it was connected to the
  computer, the camera didn't like it. Just use the cameras
  internal functions for clearing the card. Its happier
  that way. 
- The lens cap is easy to pop on and off. Even if it is
  kinda low budget, IT works. IT does its job of protecting
  the lens.  Very important to someone who likes to take
  the camera Skiing, hiking, scuba-diving (just kidding on
  that last one HA) 
- The pictures come out great on the highest res setting. I
  have tried all the other settings as well, there is no
  need to go lower then the highest res. unless your
  planning to take 1540 small, grainy pictures. 
- The menu options are easy to navigate and understand. It
  has exposeure settings, flash, white balance, all sorts
  of focus functions, timer, red eye reduction, autofocus,
  burst shooting, flex capacitor..  OPS, that last one is
  not true... 
     BUT what I'm trying to say is that for $200
dollars, this camera is an ABSOLUTE VALUE!  IT take's nice pictures, and you don't have to spend TONS on batteries, or wasting time charging batteries. Just buy one of those duracell AA 24 packs at Costco for like $12 would ya! THAT'S 24 batteries, it will last about 800 pictures!.. just make sure that LCD is off.  If that LCD is on,, WHOWW,, watch out, the batts will die after the first 30 pictures.
  
     The best part about the whole deal is that I'm never afraid to take this camera anywhere, because it only cost me $200. God forbid I drop it off a cliff, or smash it while skiing...  boo hoo, too bad. It was only $200 dollars,  Not 800 like the Sony.  That's the whole point, to take the camera anywhere and capture those moments. It's all very practical and affordable.
 
I will revisit this review in a few months, just to give you a semi-long term update.
