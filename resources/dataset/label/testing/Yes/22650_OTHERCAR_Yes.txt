            My Jetta TDI is pretty, is frugal, and is fun to drive.  

Approaching 30,000 Miles and a little over 2 years old  (99 1/2) my TDI has been very reliable and continues to be well loved.

The TDI doesn�t show its to relation my Mom's old Rabbit diesel.  I live in the SF Bay area where I primarily drive on hilly highways and mountain roads.  The torque of the diesel engine and lift of the turbo make the TDI a dream on the local highways and byways.  The TDI easily accelerates from 75 mph on an incline -- when I find myself resetting my cruise control it�s usually because the gasoline cars cannot keep up to me on the hills!

The TDI engine isn't noisy or smoky.  Although it does sound like a diesel at an idle, it is very quiet from inside the car.  It does not rattle unless it is very cold and does not push out a plume of black smoke when it accelerates.  Unlike many diesel cars, the back of the car stays clean and if a passenger comments about the noise it is usually about the whine of the turbo, which can occasionally be heard with the windows open.

Unfortunately, my Jetta isn�t quite perfect.  

The TDI rides very low in the front -- I�ve torn the front air dam loose more than a couple times when I�ve caught it on parking lot curbs.  Unlike others who�ve commented here, I�ve been fortunate enough to get it back on myself.  (Once, however, I had to buy a new fender liner after the bumper flexed enough to tear the old one apart.)

My Jetta also has a persistent heavy thump in the left front side which two dealers have been unable to locate or repair.  (My passengers more frequently comment on this than the noise of the engine.)  So far, it has not impacted anything other than my psyche.

A couple other minor problems have been repaired, both on VW�s tab:

First, the left front window lift mechanism had something break inside.  The dealer found a flawed part and replaced it.  

Next, the ratchet mechanism in the middle rear seat belt jammed while the seat was down.  This securely fastened the 2/3 section of the seat in the down position.  Although the car was off warranty, VW replaced the belt without charge.  The new belt appears to be designed to prevent a repeat occurrence -- a modified handle accommodates a stopper which prevents the belt from tightening when the seat is down.  (I guess I wasn�t the first to have the problem!)

These irritations aside, my Jetta has been an excellent car.  It is reliable, fun and inexpensive to drive.

-----
Heads Up!  I purchased my car from Santa Cruz Volkswagen whose pressure tactics made the buying experience very unpleasant.  (I wanted the car and they knew it.)  I didn�t have a much better experience with their service department.  

I have since moved and service my car at Dirito Brothers in Walnut Creek ... a night and day difference.
