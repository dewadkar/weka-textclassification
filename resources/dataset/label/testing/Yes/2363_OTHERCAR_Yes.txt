            We purchased a brand-new, fresh off the truck Nissan Maxima in 1992.  We had been looking for a Pathfinder, but that year saw mountains of snow, and there were no such animals in stock.  The dealer steered us to the Maximas, instead.

I was disinterested, initially, aside from mild curiosity at a car model I had never before driven.  We had seen Maximas, had heard they were great cars loaded with innovative features, and we agreed to test-drive one.  Now, my wife was less than excited all along at the prospect of driving a &quot;great big&quot; truck like the Pathfinder, but as we live on what is essentially a vertical drop of a street, she had conceded the necessity of a four-wheel drive vehicle.  I like trucks, for their pragmatic usefulness and durability, well as their go-anywhere rough-and-tumble excursionary wilderness abilities.  So we had agreed to hunt down a Pathfinder.

But that Maxima earned from us a second look.  Here was a wolf dressed in sheepskins.  The car left a modest bit of rubber off the line, if I really jumped on it (precipitating worried glances from the salesman), and put heads back against the seat, in any case, without trying; it cornered confidently, without much of the sluggish yaw I expect in a car with such a comfortable ride; it handled all but the rudest potholes with grace and dignity, the sort of cloud-ish, tender smoothness one generally expects only in Crown Victorias and Cadillacs; it sported buttons and gizmos in the handiest, smartest spots, and these were well-designed for comfort.  No sharp corners, chromed and angular and indelicate to the fingers, protruded anywhere in this vehicle, but instead all such devices were molded, rounded, contoured as if designed to mate perfectly with any human finger, inviting us to touch it.

I had to admit, this was a car worth considering.  I asked about its ability to handle snow, hills, and combinations of the two.  The salesman, predictably, assured us the Maxima felt perfectly at home in all weather, excepting sheer ice.  I deigned to pursue some evidence of the claim, and sought a patch of concrete that had seen no plow, but remained buried under eight inches of snow.  Amid more anxious glances from the salesman, I angled the machine into the thickest of the snows, at a point where the lot sloped more than a bit uphill, and plowed through a drift that threatened to lift the front wheels into the air; the car did not shy away, nor did it hesitate.  It spun wheels a bit, but a lesser application of gas and it regained its bite and plowed onward.  We got clear across that lot up the incline, did not become stuck, did not slide or slip, and I was convinced.  We signed on the dotted line.

The Maxima, at that time, had a highly evolved 6-cylinder engine that redefines the word &quot;reliable.&quot;  Not since the Dodge &quot;slant-6&quot; has an engine delivered immortality of this sort, I think.  In the sweltering height of summer, when the outdoor temperature topped 98 degrees, I ran this car up a New Hampshire mountainside highway at 120 MPH, with the air conditioner gusting ice-cubes at us, and the temperature gauge never wavered.  It could have gone faster, I think, due to the marvelous 4-speed automatic transmission.

Speaking of which, Nissan has discovered a set of gear ratios that remain a complete mystery to the American Big Three.  Their cars and trucks shift oddly next to any Nissan.  The Maxima was geared such that the Overdrive did far more than merely reduce the engine RPM's slightly; it kicked in when there still remained some torque to be had, and did not shift down again at the merest hint of pedal pressure (like my Blazer, Pontiac, and GMC used to do).  That fourth gear, in the Maxima (and the now-defunct Stanza, which we had owned before) really was a gear, and worked like one.

We have declined to buy another Maxima in the meanwhile, as we dislike the new body style.  Its aft section appears truncated, as if the car went incomplete.  The nose lacks the unique Maxima character previous marking it singularly among cars such that I could tell even at night when a car approaching from the opposite direction was a Maxima or only some lesser car.  But these are aesthetic concerns, important only if the vehicle is first a solid, well-built, reliable one and it gives good mileage; the Maxima still possesses all of those advantages.  As I recall, ours consistently turned in 18 MPG, averaged among city and highway.  But that was with the premium octanes; pump in cheaper gas, and the mileage dropped considerably.

I hear they have increased the horsepower of that fantastic engine from 196 to an excess of 200.  I salute the effort, but I see little point to their doing it.  The car was Secretariat, as it was.  When it comes time to buy another car, we shall seek out another Maxima, but an older one whose body style we like.  That is, if we can find someone willing to part with theirs.
