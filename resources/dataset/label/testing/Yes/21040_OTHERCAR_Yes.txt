            I bought my 1991 Tracker when I graduated from University and needed a car to get me to and from work.  I was living on my own, far away from the watchful eyes of my maintenance giving dad, and did nothing to maintain this car!  Occasionally I'd remember to check the oil and get it changed--(got better at this as the years passed)-- but with no real maintenance to speak of, my Tracker is still running great 10 years later!  It has over 220,000 km on it, and has done over 40 long distance trips between BC and Alberta, as well as driving within the city and on highways everyday.  

I have had problems recently with the e-brake sticking--so even when you put the handle down in the car, the brake is still engaged.  Also, the right hand hub often sticks and I can't get it to turn in cold weather--when I need the 4X4 for winter driving.  In seriously cold weather,-25 degrees celsius and colder, the steering and shift box get stiff as well, and it makes strange creaking noises while driving.  However, with all these idiosyncracies, I still hop in and start driving, and this car has never missed a beat!  It just gets me where I want to go, e-brake on and all!  My dad would be horrified!

When this one bites the biscuit, I'll be getting another one, --although I may have to get a four door, as my dog and I have added a husband to our package, and it's harder to get that extra luggage in under the dog!
