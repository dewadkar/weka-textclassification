            I upgraded from a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee to the 2003 Avalanche Z71 and after 2 months still can't seem to get this grin off my face.  

<p>This is just an awesome vehicle.  It's basically the undercarriage of a Chevy 1500 truck with a modified cab/bed combination.  The cab and bed are joined together as a single solid unit in the Avalanche, unlike in a regular truck, which gives it added body rigidity and makes it feel very stable in all conditions.  The ride is very smooth.  The optional Bose stereo with in-dash 6 CD changer is recommended.  It sounds better than some aftermarket installed systems and has the ability to pump out tons of distortion free low bass that modern music requires.  The 5.3L Vortec V8 has lots of get up and go, and an awesome exhaust note to boot.  It sounds like a V8, without having a loud exhaust note like some trucks you hear going down the road.  This is more refined and civilized. Handling is very nice too.  It turns a lot easier and tighter than it seems like it would, so you can navigate tight parking lots pretty easy, and wedge into some parking spots other full size trucks couldn't turn tight enough to get into.

<p>  Oh yeah, I got mine in the white without the body cladding and it looks great.  People really seem like the white Avalanche better without the cladding so I get LOTS of nice comments on it.

<p>Operation of the mid-gate is just as easy as they make it look in the commercials.  The side storage compartments in the bed seemed odd at first because I didn't know what I would be putting in there, but that didn't take long to figure out.  They turn out to be more convenient that you would ever imagine, and they are cavernous enough to hold LOTS of stuff.  I love it every time I close the tailgate too.  This isn't really a tailgate like other trucks have.  It doesn't feel like a tailgate, and it doesn't sound like one when it closes.  This is a door with the hinges on the bottom instead of the side.  When you close it, it sounds like a car door closing... nice and solid.  It seals totally to the weather too.  The hard top panel bed covers are very nice.  They pop in or out in mili-seconds... they're that easy.  The nice thing is you can remove only as many as you need to also.  

<p>There isn't much to dislike about this truck so far.  I suppose if I had anything to gripe about it would be gas mileage.  I think the engine has enough torque that the tranny could have used an extra overdrive gear.  The engine is turning about 2200 RPMs at 75MPH because of the steep gearing in the rear end.  An optional lower rear end gearing ratio would also be nice and would probably help gas mileage.  I'm slowly getting used to it, but I just didn't like the placement of my foot on the gas pedal at first.  I just couldn't find a comfortable position and the pedal felt softer and bouncier than I was used to.  Backing up can be interesting.  The tailgate is so high that it makes it difficult to see cars and people behind you.  I think they really need to add in the backup sensors that the Cadillac EXT has (so I hear).  It would be really handy to have a warning to let you know that you are about to crush that Mazda Miata that is totally hidden behind that massive tailgate on your Avalanche.  The only other thing is I think the step bars should be an included item always.  Mine didn't have them.  I have no troubles getting in, but my 5 foot 2 wife does.  I'll have to take it to get step bars added for the people that may ride this that don't have a height of at least 5 foot 8 or 9.
