            In my search for a new car, the Civic Si stood out from its class, as well as more expensive and sportier cars. The Civic stood out for a number of reasons, practical and hedonistic. The trunk was ample for the size of car, making it more than just a pocket roadster, but a car that can (an has been used) for hauling, long trips, and moving boxes. But the Si's real heart lies on the open road. With Honda's powerful and smooth VTEC engine the 1.8 liters full much larger. Paired with th Civic's relatively light body weight, the thrust to weight ratio is very favorable, making 0-60 feel faster than it is listed in car magazines. The added bonus of the Si is the Sport suspension which goes tongue and groove with the better engine. The suspension has a minimum of roll, and hold tight and well around corners, but stays stiff in high-speend lane changes. At higher speeds the suspension allows the driver a keen sense of the rad without feeling every bump and crack in the blacktop. Highway driving can be the best and worst part of this car, the best since the engine's high and low end torque provide power at any speen, even 80+ MPH for passing, and it can be the worst as the seats get somewhat uncomfortable after 3 or so hours. This is a great first car for a college student, but probably not the mid-life crisis car who can spend a bit more. Driving this car, even day-to-day in the city is a pleasure with enough horses behind you to give you a rush of air but gentele enough to handle stop-and-go to the grocery store. The seating position is fine, but the roof would be a porblem for those well over 6 feet, the back is roomy enough for two adults, but again the taller the less comfortable it is. Overall a great car, about $5000 cheaper than its next competitor and still outpreforms it. <br><br>
