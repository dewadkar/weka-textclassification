            I first started thinking about purchasing a new truck about 5 months ago.  My dad first turned me onto the Dodge Dakota as a possible option.  When I got serious about buying a new truck, I looked at Dakotas, Tundras, F150s, Frontiers, and Silverados.  I pretty much already made up my mind to purchase a truck with four doors.  The first I looked at was the Frontier after seeing a commercial for them.  They looked good on TV but when I got to the dealership, I was not impressed.  There didn't seem to be much room in the back seat.  

The next truck I looked into was the Quad Cab.  I instantly fell in love with the way it looked.  It looked more proportioned than the Frontier.  I took one for a test drive and that was all I needed to make my decision.  I spent the next two months test driving various Dakotas (2wd, 4wd, V8, V6, Sport SLT, etc.) and came to the decision that I wanted a V6 2WD SLT with all the options.  

Well, this past Sunday I found the exact Dakota I was looking for.  I bought it on the spot and drove around all day with it.  I showed it off to all my friends, family, etc.  Everyone was really impressed by the looks and the generous amount of space in the cab.  Even my mom, who hated trucks, loved it.  She even drove it and said that it drove better than her newely acquired mini van.

In the five days I've owned the vehicle, its driven like a dream.  It feels very much like you're driving in an SUV; its that nice.  The power steering feels great.  Its not too loose.  The truck accelerates nicely and makes for a great overall driving experience.

I am very happy with my purchase and recomend this truck to anyone, even people who necessarily wouldn't consider a truck.<br><br>
