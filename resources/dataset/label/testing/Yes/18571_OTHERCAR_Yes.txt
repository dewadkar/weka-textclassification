            This camera is a great buy.  Casio really out did themselves on this one. I was looking at this camera for awhile and the resolution is outstanding.
Zooming in on a distant object was never so much clearer.  Also this camera is small and barely has any weight.  It's multi-option feature is a definite plus when wanted to get that perfect picture.  Everyone looking to buy this should not give this item a second thought yet purchase it on that first thought.  The lens on this camera is a great feature.  Plus the number one feature of all, ITS DIGITAL.  Easily connects to the computer with a driver and TA-DA you have all your pictures inside your computer to do whatever you want with.<br><br>
