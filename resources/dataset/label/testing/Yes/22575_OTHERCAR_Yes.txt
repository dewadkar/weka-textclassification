            In 1996 I bought this car new.  I wasn't really shopping for a new car but someone talked me into taking a test drive and I was hooked!   Now the car has over 100k and is still running well.

It's got alot of power and it's big enough that I feel safe and comfortable driving it.   I ended up getting the option with the WS6 RamAir package and every upgrade and option there is except traction control.   It's been a good car, and it's alot of fun to drive.

My main problems with this car center around the poor quality control Pontiac had with it.  I'll never buy a new car again, especially from Pontiac, as a result of this.  Their short 36,000 warranty was timed so that when alot of the problems happened the car was going out of warranty.  In my defense for the first 3 years I had every service done exactly on time and at the dealer.   Some of the problems we had include faulty climate control system, faulty headrests (which are still broken despite dealer repairs), oil leaks at only 35k, and body parts not lining up as perfectly as they shoud've.   I paid about $30,000 for this car, and these sorts of problems are inexcusable.

The exterior has held up okay.  I don't see any signs of rust, but it has a million chips in the paint from just regular highway driving.   None of the exterior body parts have broken off or cracked as of yet.  I am a little unhappy I have to wash the alloy wheels at least once a week or they remain a dark nasty shade of brown due to the airflow pulling the brake dust onto the front wheels.  

It's proven pretty reliable not that the original glitches are fixed.  It had been a commuter car for awhile going 200 miles each way.   It doesn't need any unsually expensive or frequent maintenance, but watch out on the tire prices; $350 PER TIRE for identical tire replacements and a 40k mile life.

The interior is roomy enough for a sports car.  I would've made the seats a little bit wider and better proportioned personally though I have survived long 10+ hr drives in it.  I didn't expect the trunk to be big, but it is odd shaped so many things don't fit in it.  The saving grace is the folding rear seats which gives some additional room.   For extra passengers the rear seats are usable for adults but very difficult to climb in and out of.   The leather has held up okay to the use, but the driver seat is already showing clear signs of wear partly because it's so hard to climb in and out of.  The T-tops work well and don't leak, but honestly they're so impractical I've only taken them off once or twice.

Everything overall seems reasonably reliable.   Despite some of its shortcomings, I plan to keep the car another 5 years.   The V8 engine in it has a great sound and performance and with the Ram Air option this car takes off with over 300 horsepower.
