            I had the opportunity to borrow a friend's Mavica for a trip to Mexico two years ago.  I fell in love with the camera!  Nothing could be easier!  Slip a floppy in...take a picture, check the picture, if it's no good, delete the picture!  And when the disk is full, you've got all GOOD pictures!  And I do mean good!  It will make you look like a professional. Amazing close up shots... amazing zoom shots!  Amazing sunsets!  Gorgeous colors!  Clarity is very, very good.  I bought my Mavica last summer, and since then have convinced three other people they couldn't live without one!  There is nothing I dislike about this camera.<br><br>
