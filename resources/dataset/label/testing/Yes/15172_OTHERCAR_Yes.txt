            This is a Very good camera for the price, the body feels like an expensive point and shoot camera. The Image quality is really astounding and the colors on photos are very realistic, the software that cames with the package is good and very easy to learn.
One of the features that I love is the one that shoots 16 frames in about 4 seconds.
The LCD display is smaller than in other cameras but very realistic colors are displayed on it and all the controls in the camera are well designed and placed in the camera.
Another good feature is the timer for auto-shooting and the manual mode that let you choose the amount of light entering the lens and some many other settings to play with, and to obtain better photos.
The Flash is very powerful, I got pictures with the subject about 12 feet and the image is very bright.
The zoom in the display mode is very accurate and very usable in a LCD of this size.
The only thing I hate is the life of batteries and that the camera does not come with a charger.
My Final word is: "So much camera for the price, but what can we expect from TOSHIBA?" Excellent products of course !
