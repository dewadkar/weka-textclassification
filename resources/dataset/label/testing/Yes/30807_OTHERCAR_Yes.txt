            I've had the Olympus 340 for a while now, and am now at the taking it for granted stage. I take it for granted that I can line up a shot, snap and either print it myself, or have it done via Ofoto, and have it come out just as I intended. With prices falling and this model still available in the low 200s, it is an even better deal. While it does have a lot of features for a "starter camera", panorama, white balancing, red-eye reduction,etc.,those just interested in point-and-click will be satisfied as well. The image quality is as good as my old 35mm basic, and since I like to tinker with the images, inserting the SmartMedia card into a reader and opening it up to play with in an editing program is all the more fun. The included software, Camedia, is best avoided, since a Smartmedia card lets you bypass it and go right into a full-featured program, like PhotoDeluxe, or Photoshop. All in all, you can't go wrong with this model.
