The E430 is the best car in the Mercedes line-up.  Great handling and acceleration yet quite and comfortable.  I comparison shopped with the Lexus GS400 and the BMW 540i.  The BMW 540i style is getting old and is due for a redesign.  The interior looks 80's.  The GS400 is a hot car, fastest of the bunch, but the interior reminded me of the Toyota Camry.  

In th E430, everything works well except the radio/CD player.  The radio has a feature where it attempts to automatically adjust the volume based on the car speed.  It just doesn't seem to work well and there's no way to disable the feature.  Once you master the AC control panel it cools down and heats up real quick.  The trunk is roomy and adults fit in the back without a problem.

A note for people with children; although there is a master lockout swith for the windows there is not a similar switch for the doors.  It's possible to open the doors from the rear seats with the car moving.

I'm up to 4K miles on the E430 and getting about 23 mpg on the express way.  On a recent trip from LA to Vegas I cruised at 90 mph for 45 minutes in 110 degree heat the the car didn't strain in the least.

As the dealer said (in his German accent no less) when he passed me the keys: &quot;you have purchased zee finest motorcar in zee volrd&quot;.<p>
