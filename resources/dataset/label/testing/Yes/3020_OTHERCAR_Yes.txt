            I bought my car over a year ago. It is a 1994 limited edition convertible and hasn't proved yet that it was a bad car.  This cars are rare enough that you can catch peoples heads turning as you drive by, but not that expensive. Nissan is known to build cars that last and when I got my car it had only 42,000 and in one year alone I have put over 20,000. I am now up to over 70,000 and not one problem out of it yet. Over all my opnion of any 240sx is good, it is sporty without the high price tag of any other sports car. The biggest downfall to the 240SX convertible is safety. <br><br>
