            I bought my 1992 SC2 way back in 1995 from a Saturn Dealer in Newark, Delaware. At the time, I was looking for a car - any car - with automatic transmission, air condition, power steering and anti-lock brakes.

After the rapacious tactics of other dealers the no-hassle approach employed by Saturn was a refreshing change. They showed me a two-year-old SC2. Small quick and nimble, it felt like a rocket-powered rollerskate.

As an added bonus, it came with a burglar alarm (which I generally do not use), remote central locking and - wonder of wonders -  traction control (apparently all Saturns with Anti-lock brakes and auto transmission have this), which has made my life easier on unnumbered occasions, and saved my neck on quite a few.

Because the vehicle was bought from a dealer the three-year factory warranty was extended by a year, which gave me two years of worry-free motoring.

The warranty is but a distant memory, but I still have the car. The odometer which read 20,000 when I drove it off the lot now reads more than 168,000. I have kept up the maintenance schedule and there have been a few semi-expected repairs - two alternator replacements, two new batteries, a couple of EGRs & PCVs, and a timing chain - not bad going for five years and 140,000 miles. I expect to spend $400-$600 on maintenance this year. For some that is one or two months' car payments.

I like this car. It has carefree handling (thanks to ABS and Traction), zippy acceleration (thanks to a four-cylinder, sixteen-valve, 1.9L engine) and is great for a lad, his lady and enough luggage for a long weekend away. Its only weakness is that is is unsuited for long road trips.
