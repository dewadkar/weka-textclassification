            I bought this car to get back and forth to college which is 50 miles from where I live, one way. It got 35 to 40 miles to the gallon.  When I rear-ended someone the car protected me I was traveling on a 45 mile an hour road and abruptly needed to stop failing to i rear-ended another car.  Most cars you would have seen in the windshield not the Tercel It was completely smashed only half way up the hood.  This little car is very reliable and it zooms around comfortably and quietly.  I recommend it to everyone.<br><br>
