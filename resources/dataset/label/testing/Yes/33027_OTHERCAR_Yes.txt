            Last year I bought myself a Forest Green 1995 Dodge Avenger ES. I had bought this car via a private ad in a local newspaper. It had 96K KM on it upon purchase and to this date has over 115K.

The main reasons I was drawn to purchasing it was because of 1) The Looks
2)Safety 3) It was Mitsubishi.

The Avenger is a very sleek car to look at. From its &quot;Viper&quot; reminscent front end to the fact that the cars ride height is much lower than others. Also it is quite spacious for a coupe. (Try shuffing people into an Integra) 

The Avenger is rated one of the safest cars out there, in fact if you go to Microsoft Carpoint, it lists it as the top 10. The Avenger suited my needs because I wanted a safe car and it provides that.

Another thing, due to the fact that Dodge doesn't seem to promote these cars (I have never seen an Ad on TV/paper about the Avenger to this date) it seems to always catch the eyes of people. In fact I've had quite a few people ask me what it is!

Now of course I have had my share of trouble. Being what I call a &quot;Hybrid&quot; vehicle, you get the worst of both worlds. Being Mitsubishi (japanese) you get the expensive repair costs and being Dodge (domestic) you get lower quality workmanship which equals more $$. Luckily I bought an extended 3rd party insurance which cost a lot in the beginning but sure pays off.

So far only a few minor things have occured but were they expensive! The exhaust manifold developed a hole ($400.00CAN) the Distributor went ($1000.00CAN) the rear O2 sensor went ($350.00CAN) the EGR went melting the trandducer ($350.00CAN) and the notorious front rotors warped ($250.00CAN) I can tell you for sure the insurance company is not making $$ off me.

But overall, I'd recommend this car if you are a younger person who wants a sporty car but doesn't have the $$ to buy yourself a 3000GT VR4 or something along that line. (BTW. The Avenger is rated &quot;Average&quot; for insurance which is quite a feat for a coupe!)
