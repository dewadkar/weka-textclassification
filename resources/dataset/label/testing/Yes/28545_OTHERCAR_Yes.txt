            This car is definitely a luxury car. The interior pampers like nothing else. The seats, ergonomics and placement of controls is genius. Siting in this car is pure bliss. The seats hold you, and give you a good view of the road, while providing ample movement, to suit any kind of driver. The dashboard and control panel is very intimate, and easy to use. Everything you need is right at your fingertips. In the back, passengers are not given a giant amount of room, but this Saab isn't really large. They still enjoy the comfort of the from passengers. 

This car also looks great, it has an aerodynamic upper-class look; and it is distinctively a Saab. If Saab keeps building cars like this, we'll see them on the road for a long, long time. 

If you like this car, check out the Volvo S80: Not as intimate of an interior, but a little larger, and nicer.
