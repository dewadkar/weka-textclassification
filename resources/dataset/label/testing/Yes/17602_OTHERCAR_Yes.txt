            The Plymouth Neon is a great, affordable compact.  I am a loyal Chrysler customer and also own an 89' Jeep Cherokee.  I have been very satisfied with both.  The Neon is Chrysler Plymouth's low cost, economy compact.  It gets great mileage and doesn�t require much maintenance.  So far the only thing I�ve had to do is change the oil, and rotate the tires.  Its roomy in the front and pretty comfortable in the back if the front seats aren�t all the way back.  The seats are comfortable and the interior looks great. The stereo system is great, a nice all around sound and is easy to work.  There�s lots of trunk space and the front seat easily folds down for even more room.  The exterior is great and look great on the road.  It�s a smooth and quiet ride all around.  So far I don't have any complaints.  <br><br>
