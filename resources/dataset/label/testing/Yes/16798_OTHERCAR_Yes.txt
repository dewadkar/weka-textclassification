            I didn't know what I was getting into when buying this V-8 LS1 Camaro.  The acceleration is incredible and plenty fast to beat basically any other car off the line and all the way to the quarter mile.  The styling is unique and beautiful in it's own way, which has been the Camaro trademark since the 60's.  And of course, you can't beat the value; I paid just over $20,000 for this beauty and it is definitely worth every cent. If you want a slower car, don't look here; maybe check out the Ford Mustang.  But if speed is your thing, you can't go wrong with this Chevy Camaro.<br><br>
