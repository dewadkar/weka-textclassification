            I didn't exactly get the pick of the litter at my neighborhood Enterprise Rent-a-Car last week. In fact, I got the runt. It seems that with about half the underground parking garages in Houston having flooded the week before, rental cars are at a premium anywhere within about 200 miles. I had my choice: a 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage (already drove it, already reviewed it -- see <a href='/content_23396781700'>http://www.epinions.com/content_23396781700</a> ) or a 2001 Toyota Corolla. Where's the choice in that? I wondered. Fifteen minutes later, I drove away in the Corolla on another of what seems to be an endless series of road trips to Houston.

Four days and 487 miles later, I was back -- and now I'm here to give the Epinions community the skinny on Toyota's archetypical entry in the econo-box wars.


<b>An econobox? you ask</b>

Yeah, an econobox -- back in the dark ages (the early and mid-seventies) when Volkswagen stopped building new Beetles, a covey of Japanese imports was being offloaded in west coast ports. They featured small bodies (Detroit was still in "bigger is better" mode), small engines, no frills, and -- perhaps most important -- economy. This was, after all, the era of the Arab Oil Embargo and the first "energy crisis." These cars were inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to maintain, and inexpensive to run. Honda, Datsun (now known as Nissan), and Toyota sent us millions of 'em, and consumers lapped 'em up. The basic car, sometimes known as a "key and a heater," also became known as an econobox. 

Others have tried to make econoboxes; some successfully (Volkswagen, perhaps Hyundai and Saturn) and some unsuccessfully (other American companies, Kia) -- but no company has yet matched the design skills and the construction quality of those first three Japanese importers. The 2001 Toyota Corolla is a direct lineal descendant of the first Toyotas to cross the Pacific, and it maintains the quality and economy for which its forbears justifiably became famous.


<b>This ain't your lap of luxury, bubba -- but you get your money's worth</b>

There's nothing even faintly luxurious about a Toyota Corolla (you want luxury? go across the street to the Lexus dealer). It's a plain vanilla car that's not far removed from the old key and a heater model -- the car I drove added a radio and air conditioning, but that's just about all. There were no power windows, no power mirrors, no CD player, no sunroof. Plain vanilla. Vanilla without even a little chocolate syrup, much less whipped cream. What there <i>is</i> about the Toyota Corolla, on the other hand, is solid construction, intelligent design, and good old-fashioned reliability. Let me explain:

The car I drove had almost 30,000 miles on it (about time to retire in the land of Enterprise). That's 30,000 miles of driving by renters. Oh, sure, rental vehicles get all their maintenance right on time, but I know <i>I</i> don't treat rentals with kid gloves: rough roads? who cares. Overloaded? it ain't my car. High water? let's see if she'll float. And yet this little car was still as tight and rattle-free as the day Gulf States Toyota took delivery. Now <i>that's</i> a tough little car -- think you could say the same about yours?

The little engine hummed along with nary a quiver or a quaver, and the steering was still as tight and responsive as a brand-new car. Although not fancy, the interior is well laid out and comfortable (at least in the front seat). The control layout is convenient and the trunk spacious. In short, considering the size and price of the vehicle, it's a winner.


<b>My Rental's Equipment List</b>

- 4-cyl 1.8 liter gasoline engine yielding 125 horsepower, front-wheel drive
- Automatic four-speed transmission <i>available 5-speed manual overdrive transmission improves gas mileage and acceleration</i>
- driver/passenger side airbags, <i>side airbags available as an option</i>
- daytime running lamps
- AF/FM/Cassette Radio with four speakers 
- Air conditioning
- Interior "remote" trunk and fuel door releases
- Split, folding rear seat
- Cloth bucket seats
- Slideout cup-holders
- Map pockets in doors; medium-sized glove box

<b>Positive waves</b>

* The 1.8 litre 125-horsepower four-cylinder engine provides snappy acceleration at low speeds, and enough get-up-and-go to make the car reasonably responsive at freeway speeds. Let's be real; this thing will never outrun a Boxster, but when you punch it at sixty-five MPH, at least it responds. 
* The steering is tight and responsive, with a good connection to the road. There is a continuum from "smooth, comfortable" ride to "responsive" ride; the Corolla's on the responsive end. It's a bit jittery over bumpy roads, but not so much that you have to use a deathgrip on the steering wheel
* The dashboard and instrument panel are well laid out and controls are accessible and visible from normal driving position.
* Fuel economy galore: for mixed city/freeway driving, I got slightly over 31 mpg.
* Seat comfort is average or better.


<b>There are always at least a few negatives</b> 

* The back seat is barely large enough for an adult to get into
* Noisy (though somewhat less so than the competing cars I've test driven)
* No tilt steering wheel
* Cigarette lighter only; no additional power port
* Instrument cluster basic: no tach (but you don't need one without a manual transmission); no oil and ammeter gages (idiot lights only)
* Truly ugly wheel covers


<b>Bottom line time</b>

The Corolla has long been one of the top prospects in its class; in competition with the Honda Civic for the top slot. Other entries (For Escort, Mitsubishi Mirage, Dodge Neon...) lack either the elegance of design or the quality of construction of these two vehicles. If you seek basic transportation that is dependable, economical, and holds its value well, you cannot go wrong with the Corolla.

The Chevrolet Prizm is what is known as a "nameplate twin" of the Corolla; the body and drivetrain design are ostensibly identical, but there are minor differences in trim and options.
