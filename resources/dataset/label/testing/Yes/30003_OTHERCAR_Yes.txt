              I never though I would own a Mercedes- I always though they were big, expensive sedans for old people, but I am incredibly happy with my C240 sedan.  The C240 is A LOT of car for the money.  The onboard computer is amazing.  Based on your unique key, it remembers your seat and mirror settings.  There are also more preferences to set than a PDA... lighting, access, etc.

  Before my C240 I had a Volvo 850 and was very pleased with it.  I was sure I wanted another Volvo.   I test drove the S60 (supposed replacement for the S70/850 series) and it drove nicely, but the inside (where the driver spends all their time) was really cheap.  All the panels had movement and the console looked like a cheap Japanese car.  No frills at all.  The outside looks great but the inside was enough to completely turn me off.   Plastic under the seats, etc...  Once more, with fewer features it was MORE expensive than the C240.   I also looked at the Audi A4.  It was really nice, but took a lot of options to get up to the C240 standard list.  The A4 is built on the VW Jetta frame which was a bit of turn-off as well.  Unfortunately I didn't take the A4 for a test drive.

My only (minor) complaints are:

1) No CD player standard - only a cassette (who buys a $36000 car and doesn't have a CD collection?), and the CD changer eats up a lot of space in the glove box.  There's a whole empty slot in the dash they could have used.  I would recommend that anyone getting a C-series go for the COMMAND system.  It's only a few hundred more than the CD changer but includes a cool color LCD with map readout plus a single in-dash slot-load CD/CD-ROM.  An MP3 player would have been better than a cassette... cassettes don't have any retro appeal yet :P

2) A little underpowered.  It's great in traffic- lots of pep, but it's a little sluggish passing traffic on the freeway.  Although I would describe it as adequate not as deficient.  When you test drive it try it on the freeway and see if a C320 might suit you better.

3) The only 12v plug is for the cigarette lighter in the center console, which is covered by a great looking lid.  If you want to plug in your phone you have to have a bunch of ugly wires running out.  There is an option for a Mercedes Motorola V60 which plugs into the arm rest storage, but it's $1500 and doesn't work if you already have a V60 phone.  It has to be a MB V60.  I may try to hack my own.  I think the wiring is all run to the arm rest.

  Over all the C240 is a great car... especially when you consider all you get for the price.  All scheduled service, which is only every 10k miles, is free for 4 years and you get roadside assistance for life.   The sporty lines and suspension and low lease rates mean Mercedes aren't the cool weathly-old-guy car anymore.  If you're looking at a Volvo S60 or Audi A4, give the C240 and C320 a test drive.... I think you'll like it as much as I did!
