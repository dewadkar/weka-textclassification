            <b>The "Goods"<b>

-I like the powerful 190 HP V6 engine. I was getting on the Interstate one time and pushed the gas pretty hard, I was really surprised when this Chevy through me back into the seat!

-It has airbags and seems to be a pretty safe car.

-Insurance costs are pretty low.

-Gas mileage is good. Mid 20's.

-I think the car has a good "clean" look. Doesn't look too dated for a mid 90's car.

-Being an American made car, the service and maintenance has been reasonably priced. And I guess pretty easy to work on as well.



<b> The "Bads" <b>

-This car has bad paint. It has a strange habit of peeling off. I've heard from a auto body mechanic that it's a common thing for these cars to peel paint. Ours isn't terrible (probably b/c we had the hood repainted after a fender-bender). But this would be one thing to watch out for.

-We have had to replace the whole thermostat and radiator twice. This was a pain because it overheated 2 times within about 18 months. Part were under warranty from the repairs, but not labor! It wasn't cheap. About $300.


<i> Conclusion <i>

Overall, we've been happy with this car. It has over 125,000 miles and is currently running fine. The A/C will freeze you out! Good thing in FL! 

I think you'd be ok buying this car, just get it checked out thoroughly from a trusted mechanic (if you can find one!) before you buy.
