<b>The Car I Purchased:</b>
Oldsmobile Alero 2.4L Sedan Automatic

<b>Why Did I Buy The Alero:</b>
I recently went shopping for cars when I realized I would be moving.  I needed a new car and was looking for something in the $6,000 - $10,000 price range.

After many test drives, I settled between a '00 Mazda 626 and a '99 Oldsmobile Alero.  I decided that whichever price worked out the best would be my new car.  I liked both cars very much and was now simply looking for a good deal.

Needless to say, I picked up the Alero.  Having never driven this car (or any other Oldsmobile) before, and only seeing it on the road, I was actually very impressed once I got behind the wheel.  The "race-inspired" styling of the had always caught my attention.


<b>Driving Experience:</b>
The 2.4L engine is remarkably good.  It outperformed the Mazda 626 4cyl by great margins.  It has the feel of a v6 almost, just not as smooth gear shifting.  Other cars that I have driven like this include the VW Passat.  The 4cyl Passat has a great engine, and you pay a lot for it, and I found that the Alero performs just as well and technically has more horsepower.  So overall, I was impressed with the pickup and automatic shifting of the Alero.

It is also very easy to drive.  A comfortable cockpit makes a long drive very accommodating.  This is based on my experiences in Washington, D.C. traffic where sitting in traffic is a daily thing.  The Heat/AC controls are well position, as well as the mounting of the stereo.  I have been in cars before where the stereo is mounted so far away or at such an angle that it was difficult to use.\

<b>Leg Room, Head Room, Trunk Space, etc:</b>
After about a week driving this car, I noticed that it is definitely not for the taller population.  I am 6' tall and it seems like a good fit for me, though I would like a little additional leg room sometimes.  I would definitely not suggest this car to someone a few inches taller than me.  As for room in the back, the Alero seems to have the standard amount of legroom for a mid-class sedan.  Not to mention that it does have more than the Mazda 626 I was looking at.  Also, the trunk is ample for carrying my things around.  I build speakers (specifically subwoofers) and even the 15" ones fit nicely into the trunk.

<b>Things I Like:</b>
  Good Pickup
  Good Looking
  Fun to Drive - Great Handling
  Comfortable Front Seats
  Big Trunk
  Fog Lights
  Regular Grade Unleaded Gas

<b>Things I Don't Like:</b>
  Gas Mileage (20-25 mpg)
  No Coin/Change Compartment
  Fuel Cap on Passenger Side
  Some of the Vinyl on the doors is coming off
  Oversized Radio Compartment (a big waste of space)

<b>Future Additions:</b>
  CD/Radio Deck
  White Gauge Covers (speedometer, tac, etc)


<b>My OVERALL Experience:</b>
I have only had this car for a little more than a month and I really like it.  After I get my new CD Deck in it I will be even happier.  I have been happy with its reliability (through one month) and look forward to it keeping me company in Washington, D.C. traffic.  I have gotten many comments from people who like it and also a positive comment from a mechanic who checked it out for me.  He told me that he rarely sees them in the shop and they are reliable cars in their early years.  But, to look into getting an extended warranty once I hit 60,000 miles.

(I did some more research into this and it seems the intake manifold on the Alero is flawed and has costs many people a lot of money.  Thus, hopefully by the time I reach 60k, GM will have issued a recall on it.  Let's hope.)

Thus, my overall opinion is that this is a good buy.  It is rather inexpensive and a very reliable car.

I recommend it to anyone getting a first car out of college or even for college.
