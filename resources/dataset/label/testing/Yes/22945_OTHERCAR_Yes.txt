            Well, what can I say. I gave up my ever so lovely '89 Accord LXi for this '96 Accord EX. 

Overall the EX is a great car. You can't beat the gas mileage, and after driving it for about 3 months now, I'm told that the automatic transmissions in essence "learns and adapts" to my driving style. Which it has....or seemingly has. When I step on the gas the car responds with a very loud hum, acknowleding my need for speed and zooms. It helps to add the right spark plugs and oil to optimize the VTEC engine, I noticed a big difference after adding copper head plugs that I bought on my own and took to the tune-up guys.

The bad thing about the car is the handling. I don't like the way it turns at all, and the steering wheel isn't as responsive as the LXi was. The car doesn't cut corners well, and I'm always hitting my rear tires on curbs. The backseats aren't really roomy, but I'm used to a 4 door, so I don't have anything to base it on. The gas tank light never goes on when I'm low, and the gas never seems to fill all the way to the "F" line. My final complaint is the squeakiness in the interior. When I hit a tiny bump in the road, something squeaks in the car. I thought it was the tires at first, but something in the dashboard (or near my feet) isn't right - it keeps making noise and I wouldn't know where to begin to look for it, and fix it. Sounds like something needs oil.
