            I have owned this and two other digital cameras in the last 3 years and this is a work horse! I do festivals and special events and portrait work. I have shot over 11,000 photos in the last 14 months with this camera and it does great work.
Even though it is 2.1 mega pixels the detail is great and colors are true. I could have bought a 4 mega pixel or better for about the same price but the optical zoom on most of them was about 3 or 4. What this means is that when you need to enlarge an area to print you start to loose resolution and end up with a lossy print. With the FD97 you start at 10X optical and don't have to crop into a area to print because you can compose the shot in the camera. Also it zooms to 20x digital and the results are pretty good even at 20x.
Custom shooting: you can do animated .gifs right in the camera  composed of 10 shots in sequence also Tiff, jpg and line art type of shots. 
I find the REFRESH RATE between shots is best at 1024x768 you can make nice 5x7 or 8x10 photos and only have to wait about 1.5 sec to make the next shot. If you use 1600 tiff mode you will have to wait about 5 sec between shots.
The THREE LEVEL FLASH works great at  low=5ft, normal= 0~12ft and high=15~18ft. Its better than I expected from a built in flash and recharge is pretty quick.
Flexible media is great as you can shoot on floppy or memory stick and you can copy from one format to the other in the camera. I have sold some shots on floppy that I copied from the memory stick and gave to people on the spot.
Sony's BATTERY LIFE is really great with the NP-f550 battery and the LARGE VIEW SCREEN plus SLR type viewer are great in that you can choose if you want to use the SLR type viewer in places where the LCD screen viewer would cause a problem, (ie :bright sun or in a darkened theater). 
The CHARGER for this camera and two other Sony cameras I own are the same type unit so I can carry less equipment plus the F-550 battery fits my Sony TRV-320 digital video camera.
YOU need to find one and try it to see the quality as there are countless other feature regarding exposure settings and micro mode also.
