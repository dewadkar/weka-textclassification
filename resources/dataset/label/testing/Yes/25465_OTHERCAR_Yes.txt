<TEXT>
            I bought my 98 Saturn new and have had virtually no troubles with it.  I drive quite a bit - actually I have passed the 40,000 mile mark and it's only been 1 1/2 years!  My Saturn just seems to enjoy working.  It is more than happy to trundle along with a completely full trunk or nothing but me in it.  The only real problem I have had is with the cruise control.  Once in a while it will decide to stop working w/ no reason, but usually only for 5 or 10 miles and then it spontaneously starts again.  I have not had this looked at yet, but I think I will soon!  
	The people at Saturn are as friendly as ever, even now they remember my name and chat with me when I am waiting for my oil changes.  My only complaint in this area is the amount of paper they use -  after every visit I get a letter that just says &quot;Thanks for letting us serve you&quot; etc.  While it is nice to get, it seems a terrible waste of paper.  Perhaps a postcard would do just as well. :)<br><br>
