            Purchasing:

We purchased a 1990 454 SS from a used car dealer in a little town about 10 miles from us. For those of you who don't know what a 454 SS is, its a special edition Silverado made for 4 years. They stiffened the suspension tightened the steering ratios, and put a big block 454 in it to burn the P275/60/15's placed on it. When bought it had 157,000 miles on it and a new motor. The motor only had about 8,000 miles on it. The body of the truck was a little rough there were a couple of scrathes here and there a ding on either side of the truck. We had it painted and professional detailed out for about 2000 dollars. It lookes really good know. I have to say that we have had several things to fix other then body work. We had to put brakes, shocks, tires, and fog lights. After we had the brakes done we had a brake line burst on us so we had to replace brake lines all the around. When ever this truck had something break which is pretty regular we end up using every tool we own to fix it.  We have place 2 alternators on it 3 batteries, and pretty much rebuilt the whole truck with how much we have down to it. In the last couple of months though it is running good and clean.

Horror Stories:

The very first year of this special edition truck they put the Turbo 400 transmission in it (3 speed no overdrive) We have found out that when your on the highway doing 70 miles an hour it runs about 3800 rpms. This is hard on the motor so we have had a lot of things happen on the highway. After a good long ride one day, it had been on the highway all day we turned on the fog lights and parking lights becuase it was starting to get dark and the alterantor fried. We did hear before it went and smelt so we had time to get off the highway and pull into a Toyota dealer before it actually started smoking. We had a pulley that we had replace 4 times because it would squeal at a stop. We found out later that the fan belt they was recommened by the factory for this truck was to tight and running the hell out of the pulley. The Air Condition didn't want to kick on we when first got it. We replace the a/c clutch and the compressor and it worked fine after that. The ride is pretty harsh and gets old after driving on those beet up side roads and highways. 

Newer Years:
Chevrolet only made about 16,000 of these trucks over a 4 year period. I think they did finally relize that the Turbo 400 transmission was hard on the motor so in 91 they replace it with a 4 speed with overdrive and it helped the gas milage and made that engine more reliabe. 

Verdict:
This is a fun truck once u get through off the craup and make it a study truck it should last for ever. They fun to drive they steer like a sports car and is nice to have for work, and play.
