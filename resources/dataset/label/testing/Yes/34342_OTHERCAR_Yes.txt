            We bought our 2000 Century from a dealer who had one as a program car. The drive and feel at our test drive sold us. The V-6 engine has plenty of power (but is not good on gas). 

Several power features are available- seats, windows, etc... Be aware the trunk release button is in the glove compartment- we didn't know that and found it months after purchase!

The Century will give you a smooth and quiet ride. It also has a wonderful sound system and very comfortable seats which adjust to many positions - an important feature for someone like me who has back problems.

One quirky feature I do not like is that the sun visor bumps into the rear-view mirror when you put it down- knocking the mirror out of adjustment. Poor designed there!

As far as service, we have encountered no difficulties so far except one power window motor went out while it was still under warranty. Other than that we have only taken it in for routine maintenance. We have owned the car for about six months at this writing. It just topped 36,000. We are pleased with the purchase.
