Pros:  Dependability, Durability, Security
Cons:  Options and gear ratios


I would recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for overall quality and performance. My truck has easily gone through a wreck and some off roading. I would highly recommend this truck!

Currently I am debating on purhcasing a Z71 but I have to admit that due to gas prices being so high I feel that for the average use that I get out of the truck that I deffinately have the correct size pickup and package for everyday use.

I think that there are too many trucks out there that have the capability to be able to haul and carry all kinds of loads that dont really need the power.

Trust me on this it makes a large difference in how much your monthly payments are to be fi you go with the Cheyenne package instead, you still get air and stereo etc. 

Think carefully before making the decision on which type of truck you want to get.
