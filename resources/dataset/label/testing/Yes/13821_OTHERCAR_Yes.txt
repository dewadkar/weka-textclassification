               The Mercedes it speaks  for itself, for my opinion i think this car is off the hook. The S500 is very sporty fast luxurious,that handles like a dream, looks like a spaceship with all the extra lites that i put on i put on the zeon fog lites and i put AMG 18 inch rims . The car has all of the features that you would ever want like navagations system, traction control, anti-skid, anti-fog windows, all one touch windows, double glass windows for soundproof and etc...i mean this car has everything u name it it has it . the power on this car is out of control it has the speed of a vett handles like a porche it is room like a living room the leather is softer then a baby ass. so to all of you benz lovers this is the car of the century. if you are thinking about buying this car i know that you will be making the right choice..
