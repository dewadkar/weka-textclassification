            You know, I don't even own this car, my brother does. He got it last year as his first car used. It's so screwed up. The windows suck and go up slow, hell, sometimes they don't work. The cassette player doesn't work. The car is old and crusty. With all this, it receives the award of the greatest damn ghetto mobile i've ever set foot in. I love this car, even though it's screwed up. It's just so comfortable to sit in. I mean, there are so many new cars out there that don't have enough room for my 6'5&quot; 260 lb brother or me, being 6ft 250 lbs to fit in. I'm not sayin we're fat, just huge and muscular. We can't fit good together in other cars. In this car, i'm comfortable. It may have stopped altogether on us two times, but I still love the car, and when it stops for the last time, I'll be happy to be the one to the blow the thing up. All hail the ghetto mobile!<br><br>
