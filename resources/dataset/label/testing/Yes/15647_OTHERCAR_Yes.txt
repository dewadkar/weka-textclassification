            My mother and I purchased this camera knowing nothing about digital cameras or how to work them.  A friend recommended this model because of the ease of use.  We figured we'd learn a few features and just about be able to take pictures and load them with the camera.  We were so wrong.  This camera is so wonderful.  My 10 year old brother operated this camera like a professional photographer.  Forget the cords and cables to connect your camera to the computer.  No memory flash cards.  Regular disks. I recently took pictures on a trip and send my friends disks instead of paper photos, I saved so much money.  This camera even takes moving shots.  It's really amazing all the things you could do.  We were skeptical, one can pick up a digital camera for cheaper, but nothing like this one, it's worth every penny.   <br><br>
