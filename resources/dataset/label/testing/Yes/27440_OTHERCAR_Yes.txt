            I bought my neon in a hurry after totaling my other car.
The dealer saw me coming and really raked me for every penny he could.
Now that it's paid for and still running I don't feel so bad for getting ripped off.  With 168,000 miles, my neon has never left me stranded--ever!

Complaints:

Bad seals around windows and loud whistling is common on highway.
My trunk fills with water every time it rains.  I think it is a leak around the back window seal and it drains through the trunk lid to the spare tire and floor behind drivers seat.  This is VERY annoying, making my car stink of mildew and causing speaker failure.  
The brakes squeak very loud intermittently.
Trunk is too high and cannot see when backing up.

I've put this car to the test, adding 100,000 miles in just 4 years.
Things are now starting to break.
In the past year we've replaced rear struts, battery and starter motor.
I'm crossing my fingers that she'll stay out of the shop for another year and I'll be able to afford fixing the water problem and have some music when I drive again.
Rust is minimal considering I live where they use salt on the roads in winter and salt air from the ocean in summer.
