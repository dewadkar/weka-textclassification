              <b>As</b> a replacement for the almost 20 year long running Ford Escort, the Focus boasts class leading handling, interior space, and relatively dramatic styling for the 2000 model year. With a range of 2 engines, the most powerful for 2000 is the 2.0 130 horsepower DOHC Ztec carryover from the Escort ZX2, the other is a SOHC carryover from the base Escort. A 170 horsepower SVT Focus will be available for 2002, using a beefed up Ztec engine.  

<b>Note:</b> There is an excellent review on this 2002 SVT Focus here at Epinions.com for more info.

        <b>T</b>he Ford Focus drives almost as good as it looks. The steering is superb, being light and very accurate. The 5-speed manual transmission can boast the same claim of being extremely precise and tall geared, letting you guide the Ford Focus ZX3 perfectly. The advanced, all-independent <b>suspension</b> gives a near- flawless blend of excellent ride quality and handling. The car 'turns in' sharply, helped  by its passive rear-wheel steer, and grips well even with the relatively small tires. This car is hardly ever thrown off line when driving hard and fast. With the somewhat free revving 2.0 liter Ztec power, the Ford Focus can hit 60 mph in less than 9 seconds (according to specs). Acceleration is is good, and tackling hills in this small FOMOCO built hatchback is a piece of cake.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
 
         The <b>interior</b> boasts quality that is more than adequate for a car in this class and model year. Tons of room for 4 adults, comfortable seats, 'super easy' ergonomics, tons of amenity options, and a 'new edge' instrument cluster to add that extra sporty touch. The drivers position is very good allowing for excellent outward vision, and easy access to the HVAC controls and all the gadgetry placed on the dash fascia. The plastics in the Focus also claim superior quality over cars like the Chevy Cavalier. Seating is good, however the bucket seats contain very little bolstering supports for aggressive driving.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>


 The <b>exterior</b> is very handsome, a small grille, and futuristic headlights are integrated into both the hood and fenders. C-pillar mounted taillights can be found in the rear. This car is definitely more European than American looking, after all the Focus first made its debut as a production car in May 1997 in Europe, and made European car of the year! The Focus made Motor trends car of the year in 2000 when it went into production in the USA.


<i>Pricing:</i>
          
    The <b>price</b> of the Ford Focus ZX3 is right on target, starting at around $14,000 the ZX3 Focus is a must if you are in the market for a sporty economy car.

 These cars have been reliable according to Consumer reports.Org. Remember the 1986 Ford Taurus got great reviews on reliability until 4 years later when all the transmissions started going out. This car is only 2 years old in the USA. However the Escort which this cars' powertrain is identical was very reliable.
