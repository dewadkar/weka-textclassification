            Do you like four-wheelin'? or at least knowing you could? Well, even if you don't like either of those ideas, this is the car for you. The 2000 Jeep Cherokee is a wonderful car: it really captures what a sport utility vehicle should be. We had a Jeep Grand Cherokee up until this one, but it really was nothing but an oversized sports car. This thing is part car part beast. Its really like a sports car in a truck body. What pushed me away from the Grand Cherokee was that it had an independent suspension which made it ride and drive like a sports car, but this car does not, so if one wheel goes up or down, every one feels it. Additionally, I recently was driving it in an ice storm and went skidding off the rode. Now, I was afraid that I would have bent the rack or the axle because I really nailed the curb at like 35 or 40 miles per hour, and I hit it dead sideways. So I brought the car in to my garage and laid down underneath and ya know what I saw? Nothing. Darn thing held up like a Sherman Tank. Sure, I bent the front driver's side wheel but that's cause I had to opt for the aluminum wheels. Now, I can tell you with quite certainty having been underneath many of these cars, that if I had to be in an SUV where I knew the strength of it mattered, I would choose this.

Another thing that makes this car an animal is the engine. Sure, you can opt for the 2.5 liter four cylinder economy engine; however, most opt for the 4 liter in-line six cylinder engine which is the standard engine in the new nationally run special on all Cherokees at $279/mo for 36 months. This twelve-valve engine cranks out 190 horses and provide a powerful punch of 225 foot-pounds of torque. The SUV comes with shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive and is rated at 17/22 mpg in 4WD and 18/24 in 2WD.

The interior of the car is extremely comfortable and spacious. The back of these automobiles usually goes overlooked but this vehicle seats five adults comfortably. And with 33 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk theres plenty of &quot;Utility&quot; in this SUV. Plus, you can always fold down the rear bench and expand the cargo area.

As far as options go, you can really beef this truck up. If you choose the 279/mo. deal, you get dual airbags, power steering, locks, windows and mirrors, plus AM/FM/Cassette Player. You also get air conditioning, tilt steering, automatic transmission and keyless entry. You can always add on a CD-Player, fog lamps, ABS, Cruise Control or a towing package.

Another great thing about Jeeps, is Jeep 101. Its a special weekend once a year, where Jeep hires a construction crew to come out to your area and build an off-road track. Then, if you are registered for it, they will call you and invite you out to the track to try out some off-roading in their jeeps, not yours. They have 75 degree drops and inclines and 45 degree side slopes and a whole bunch of other crazy terrain.
