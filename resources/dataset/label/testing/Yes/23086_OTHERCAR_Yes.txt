            I got this camera because it was in my price range. It was on sale the day after Thanksgiving for 99.95 I had to be there at 6 AM though.  It is a nice camera and very easy to use. If I use the LED viewer to see my pictures it eats my batteries real quick.  The installation of the software was a breeze.  I download my picture's using Microsoft Picture It!  Do not have a problem with it.  The only thing I didn't like about the download process was hooking the adapter to the back of the computer so I ordered the flash path where I can insert the media card into and download it from there.  A whole lot simpler to use.  Although the flash path uses batteries also (2 watch batteries) and as soon as I get through downloading the pictures I have to remember to remove the flash path from my 3 1/2 disk drive.
It makes real good pictures for the web and ok pictures for printing if you have a good printer.
The only complaint I have is when you are in a low lighting area there seems to always be a red tint to the pictures but I have been able to correct that using Picture It.  I think it is more the camera user error rather than the camera itself. Also the little green light in the viewing area is a pain til you get used to it.
It is a very nice camera and I got it at a good price so that makes it better.<br><br>
