            If one thing is clear, it's that Toyota knows how to roll out cars, trucks, SUVs and Sedans that soon become the darlings of the average consumer.  With the Toyota Avalon, Toyota has uncovered a new niche of conservative consumers who want value, reliability, sophistication and comfort in their vehicles.  The 2003 Toyota Avalon is the latest redesign for the Avalon.  Keep in mind that it was redesigned for the 2000 model year.  This 2003 model has a strong appeal and will sure catch the attention of many buyers.  After all, it remains the flagship of the automaker.  The speed at which Toyota company redesigns or improves something from the exterior looks to any major area shows that the company is serious about providing top quality services to its large customer base.  

In the 2003 Avalon, you will find a revised front grill and new rear taillights.  It's offered in the XL and XLS trim levels.  You can choose to have it with front bench or bucket seats.  Behind the wheels of my tester, I was under the impression that I was safe and insulated from the chaos of the rest of the world.  For the most part, I felt that way when I looked at my fellow road users.  I found the sedan to be very responsive.  It handles very well.  On that beautiful Fall Sunday afternoon, I had a blast driving it on the Freeway.  It provided an excellent performance.  The 2003 Toyota Avalon is equipped with the MacPherson struts, coil springs and gas shocks at the four corners, front rear stabilizer bars and dual-link rear suspension.  

What I liked the most about the Avalon was the sense of complete freedom and comfort that came upon as I looked at its layout of displays and controls.  The cabin reminds me, to a certain extent, of that of the Honda Accord, which remains one of my favorite sedans.  The analog gauges are complemented by a computer center with a legible read out of useful information such as inside/outside temp, day, month and year etc.  By the way, they are easy to read.  I had a great view of the road and surrounding areas.  Visibility is greatly improved.  Just like any modern sedans, the 2003 Toyota Avalon is equipped with a center armrest that doubles as storage with a flip out dual cupholder.  

<b>How about seating room and other features in this sedan?</b>

Taking a quick look at my fellow passenger, I could tell that she had enough leg space.  She was very comfortable.  We had no rear seat passengers.  It's my understanding that they could get pretty comfortable there.  I sat there on two occasions to find out how much leg, head and hip room they would have, I came out pretty satisfied with the results.  If the average consumer has an average height or even my height, seating should not pose any problems at all.  In addition, they will have access to flip-out dual cupholder and storage space.

<b>Trunk space, safety and warranty</b>

The 2003 Toyota Avalon has a large trunk, which comes handy for most families.  It will allow you to haul many important items for the house or business.  Shopping and family travels will be greatly facilitated.  The Avalon offers a basic 3-year or 36,000 miles warranty, powertrain:  5 years/60,000 and corrosion: 5 years/unlimited mileage.  In terms of safety, the Avalon comes equipped with dual front airbags, front seat mounted side impact airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and electronic brake force distribution, daytime running lights, side-impact door beams, full size spare time, trunk entrapment release and power door locks with anti-lockout feature.  My tester, the XLS model even offers anti-theft system with engine immobilizer, integrated fog lights, multifunction remote keyless entry and homelink universal garage door opener.  The XLS has navigation system and vehicle skid control.

<i>The Avalon is great car</i>

If you want power, safety, reliability and a bit of luxury in your everyday transportation, the Avalon can offer them to you.
