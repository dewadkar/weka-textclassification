            I took delivery of the 2001 Eldorado ETC last week, and for the first time in a long time, I wanted to drive just for the fun of it. 

This is a car that doesn't believe in the word "understatement". It is immediately bold, it's even slightly intimidating, but only to others. Eldorado's design is chic, and although its lines are hardly new, it pushes back on the rounded edge trend of its competitors. Eldorado cuts like a knife, it spares the chrome, it's more raw than other luxury coupes. In a word, it's sexy. 

Inside, probably the most comfortable seating anywhere. Yes, anywhere. Heated leather massages me into a back-to-the-womb experience. The controls, buttons, and gages are masculine, clean, without superfluous glitz. Zebrano wood surrounds me, REAL Zebrano wood, even on the steering wheel. I am moved, and haven't even pulled away from the curb. 

I'm not prepared for the rush. The Northstar 32-valve V8 makes ETC the world's most powerful front-wheel-drive production luxury coupe. It purrs out into the lane. Then it roars. Cadillac says it has 300 horsepower. But I call it lionpower. Lithe, quick, muscular, confident. And the handling, incredible. While other coupes only offer ABS, ETC has StabiliTrak, a computerized network that controls the suspension system, steering, and ABS brakes in unison. I drive to a secluded road. I actually try to wipe out. It won't let me. 

Oh, the ride. Sweet. Its variable road-sensing suspension uses fast-acting computer-controlled dampers to instantly adjust ride and handling, whether rough, winding or wet. (And by the way, when wet, the windshield senses raindrops via infrared beams and automatically adjusts the wipers to the intensity of the storm.) In my hands, I feel this series of integrated hydraulic, electronic, and magnetic controls that delivers more steering power for low- speed maneuvers, and less for higher cruising speeds. It stays tight around all my local hairpins. 

And the whole experience is very, very quiet. Until I switch on the powerful Bose� 425-watt sound system with eight individually equalized speakers. 

Very, very quiet. Until I log onto the OnStar� communications system, built right into the rear view mirror with touchless voice control, not only giving me emergency and concierge travel services, but also local weather, news headlines, and yes, it even reads me my email. Then there's the location tracking through a very friendly GPS system. The first time I push the button and speak into the mike, a pleasant, live voice comes on to say, "Good afternoon, Mr. Brown, I see you're on East Avenue near Elmwood Avenue. How can we help you today?" 

Very, very quiet. Until I shut down the dual automatic climate controls, jet down the windows with a single touch, and zap back the moonroof to catch the supersonic-like sounds of air flowing by, and to feel the subwoofer-like rumble of four stainless steel exhausts that leave my own personal vapor trail. 

My Eldorado Touring Coupe�s not just for show. It's for go. It's all Cadillac, but it's also BMW, Porsche and Jag. This particular one, in Crimson Pearl -- a special clearcoat metallic red that looks an inch deep -- shouts one command to anyone idling near me: "Catch me, if you can."
