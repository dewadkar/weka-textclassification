            My husband and I bought this vehicle because we live in Ski Country - over the hills where 4 wheel drive is a MUST.  This vehicle has gotten us where we needed to go, reliably &amp; safely.  It is a great riding vehicle with lots of elbow room.  We can even fit the whole family - including our 120 lb rottweiler in the car comfortably.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is considering buying a 4 wheel drive.  As long as you don't plan to go &quot;off the road&quot; with it - then I don't think it will hold up to well.<br><br>
