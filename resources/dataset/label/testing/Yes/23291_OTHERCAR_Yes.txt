            The Chevy Cavalier is one of the best cars. My parents bought it in 1990, and it was brand new when they got it too. Now ten years later the car is still in good shape and it still runs. It has gone through both of my parents and I have been driving it for three years.

 I absolutely love our family car. It has a great stock radio, the seats are so comfortable, it is big enough for five people, and it just keeps going. These are all things that I love about the car. 

It is so durable. When Chevrolet made this car they did a great job. I would not trade this car for the world. As long as it keeps going so will I.
