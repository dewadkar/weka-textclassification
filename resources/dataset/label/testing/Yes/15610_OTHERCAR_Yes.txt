            Sony Mavica FD91

Once I got the past the expectation that the Sony FD91 with floppy drive would totally replace my conventional camera I had more fun than you can imagine. To start with, it�s expensive but if you are the type, like me, that likes to take lots and lots of pictures, there is no easier way to enjoy, share and view your pictures. Unlike other digital cameras that require cables, adapters or memory cards, the Mavica places your pictures on conventional and inexpensive floppy disks allowing easy downloading to your own computer or anyone else�s. For those times when you visit grandma or just a friend the thrill of giving them easily viewable pictures is priceless. 
There are some negatives though. It�s big and it�s heavy and you do have to carry extra floppies but that long lens sticking out of the front takes some incredible long distance shots. Besides, you�re still taking pictures when the other guys� memory card is full. And floppies are cheap, cheap, cheap! The FD91 works best in fair to bright light. Dim lighting tends to make the picture grainy. The flash unit is too small for the average room with the result being underexposed shots. Perhaps an attachment with a self-powered slave flash unit would help. These items should be available at most camera shops. 
By the way the FD 91 does take up to one minute AVI�s but if you really want to shoot video than you should use a video camera..

Battery life is excellent and additional batteries are available through Sony but can be found at lower prices at places like Staples. Its controls are intuitive for the most part and work well. Expect 8 to 10 JPEG�s at 1024X768 or 15 to 18 at 640X480. One BMP (Bitmap) per disc. I see no difference between BMP format or Jpeg on my monitor. 

No you can�t do professional photography with the FD91 but for vacation and event pictures it can not be beat. You can even rationalize it�s high cost�.eventually. I did and I could not be happier.   MaxSinger
