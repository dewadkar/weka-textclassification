            I have had a Jeep for two years and never thought I would like it. I was wrong. It is an easy SUV to use and keep well maintained. The only bad part is do not get BLACK. There are to many black ones on the road and they are very hard to keep clean.
The extras are not really worth it. I had to have my upgraded CD player replaced after two weeks and the replacement is doing the same exact thing the original is doing (skipping track 5 or 6 in every CD played).
We took the Jeep on a mining vacation in the Black Hills mountains of  North Carolina . It handled the steep hills both up and down with ease.<br><br>
