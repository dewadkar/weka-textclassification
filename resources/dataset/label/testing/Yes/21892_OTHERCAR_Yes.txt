            I bought my 2000 528i wagon at the BMW dealer auction in LA after carefully considering the competition (A6, E320, 9-5, V70, etc.).  Although it is slightly smaller than it's competition, the handling of this car is nothing short of amazing.  It's firm yet compliant.  By way of comparison the E320 is soft and loses its composure in the twisties and the V70 and 9-5 are firm but harsh.  Only the A6 is even close, and it's also a bit soft.  The inline 6 is not quite as powerful as one might wish for, but it gets the job done and is incredibly smooth.  I sold a S70 T5, which had lots more power but didn't handle nearly as well.

Front seat comfort is excellent, but the rear seat suffers a bit in comparison to the E320.  But heck, I don't sit back there.  Seriously, though, my in-laws are content with it and consider it an improvement over the S70.

The rear area is large enough for most things, and with the seat folded down I have no complaints.  Only occasionally to I have to go get "gertrude", the 1990 B250 van we use for really large stuff.

The controls are logically placed, but some have rather cryptic symbols that require perusal of the owner's manual.  I really appreciate the radio controls on the steering wheel.

In short, this is an excellent car if you're looking for sports sedan handling combined with wagon practicality.  I can't think of a better alternative.
