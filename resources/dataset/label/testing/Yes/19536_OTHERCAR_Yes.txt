                 I bought my Blackhawk in August of 1999.  Of all the cars in the lot, this one stood out.  I didn't have much to spend but this car was exactly how much I was willing to spend.  I had just returned home from overseas and was in need of a vehicle.  I was given 24 hours to test out my soon to be baby and saw no flaws whatsoever.  The next day, it was mine.

     It was everything i wanted in a car.  The Blackhawk rides smoothly, handles perfectly, the breaks have never locked in any emergency, and the gas mileage is great.  I have no problems working on the engine since everything is in good reach except for the oil filter which has given me a hard time every once in a while.  However, the pros greatly outnumber the cons with this car.

     I bought the car with 55,000 miles and I should be passing the 100,000 mile mark in the next 5 months.  I've driven from my home in Norfolk, VA to Key West, FL and commute weekly from Norfolk to Washington D.C. driving around 400 miles a week.  Not once has my Blackhawk overheated or broken down since I've had it.  I can't say that for any of the other 10 cars I've owned.  

     After I purchased my car, I installed a CD player, 15 inch subwoofers in the trunk, and 2 inch tweeters on the doors.  The speakers that came with the car make this sound system better than any other system I've ever heard.  With the subwoofers in the trunk, I still have enough room to fit my acoustic guitar, toolbox, and other bulk items with great ease.  The interior is still perfect.  The bucket seats provide perfect support.  There is so much room inside, i could fit everything i need for the trip to Florida and still see out of the rear view mirror.

     The 1997 Toyota Tercel Blackhawk is a great car for beginning drivers for the price, it's perfect for any kind of driving, and it's safe.  I feel safe with dual airbags, antilock brakes, and low center of gravity.  However, if you have a need for fast take-off, I suggest you stick with a Mustang, but the Blackhawk will go fast.  The speedometer goes up to 110 mph, but I've seen it go beyond that.  I don't suggest anyone try that, though.
