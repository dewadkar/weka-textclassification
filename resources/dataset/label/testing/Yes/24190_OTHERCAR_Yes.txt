            This is definetly a great buy.  I got a pretty good deal on this camera when it first came out.  Retail $500 -- I got it for $385 from an e-business. (I can't remember the name)

I had a different digital camera prior to the Cybershot.  The cybershot blew it away!  It's small, lightweight and has GREAT battery life.  

THE PROS:

1) GREAT battery life.  One charge lasts for weeks if I don't use the camera on a daily basis.  When I was on vacation, I charged the camera before I left.  I went on an oversees trip and took ALOT of pictures and had to show all my relatives my "toy".  I didn't have to recharge the camera for 6 days.  Over that amount of time I took about 120 pictures (at 1280 X 960 resolution).

2) The LCD display is bright and easy to see.  It swivels as well...that feature really amazes people. =)

3) The USB cable that comes with the camera is nice and easy to use.  You can't get more simple that using a USB cable to transfer pictures to your PC.

4) it's very easy to use.  That is important for the average consumer.

5) It comes with a lens cover which I found a very nice touch.

6) Pretty Durable.  I "dropped" it once....I managed to grab a newspaper (thickness of about 3 pages) and block the direct thud onto the floor, but there was a dull thud.  The camera worked as if nothing had happened.

THE CONS:

1) THe software the camera came with left me desiring more.  It was ok to use....editing was ok.  Not as easy or even the setup wasn't as I wanted it.  But that is easily fixed.  You can just use other software or just learn how to master the MGI PhotoSuite.

2) It didn't come with a case.  At first I carried this around in a simple bag/case that was really a kid's little purse and it scratched up the panel near the buttons.  Nothing happened to the lens or anything, but I wish it would have had a case so that it wasn't scratched up cosmetically.

3) I like the Memory stick technology and I hate it.  The only reason why I hate it: The price.  If Sony would lower their prices to be equal to SmartMedia or Compact Flash cards, more people would buy the stuff that goes with the Memory stick technology.  

Overall, I was VERY impressed with Sony's creation.  The last few years I've been disappointed with some of the things Sony has produced.  I've had bad luck with a number of items that I have bought...poor quality and high prices...but this camera has made me change my mind about Sony. =)
