            I picked up my Taurus at an auction for 3/4 of the going price at a used car lot and think it was a great deal. (made even better, incidentally, by the fact that my old car's engine fell out shortly after buying the new one)

After buying it, I found that it was a very nice car to drive. The ride was quite smooth, and it came very well equipped. To my delight, the stock stereo could even produce a decent amount of bass. 

I encountered some problems to be corrected in the area of blown struts and both tierods needing replacement, as well, one of the bearings is making noise. While the mechanic says it is not a real problem, it can get annoying. I would normally rate a car lower for such problems, but I happened to learn that this car was previously a rental. And as I bought it with 75,000 kilometers (46,000 miles), I would have to blame this more on the poor maintenance practices of rental companies.

The Ford Taurus gets very good mileage and provides a very good ride in my opinion. The ride was a large priority to me, as my wife and I visit the inlaws a couple of times per month, and it is a two and a half hour trip each way, so we do about 10 hours of distance driving per month. So far I have not been disappointed.

One of my personal favorites is the well-designed center console. It comes with good size cup holders, with staggered heights to make your drinks easy to reach. In addition, it has the standard change holder for quick access to change for the meter, and a holder that holds 6 cassettes, or a cell phone, or what have you. The Console folds down to become a center seat, and blends in so well, it was a week before I discovered it. Another great feature is the passenger side airbag and rear center passenger shoulder belt, both adding to the safety of the vehicle.

I would reccomend the Ford Taurus to a friend, and would buy one again, although I would make sure next time that it wasn't a rental car in a previous life.
