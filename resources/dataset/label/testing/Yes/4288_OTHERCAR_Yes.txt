            What a car! I can honestly say I have never liked a car as much as I do my New Beetle.  I find myself out washing it at 6 in the morning on my days off!  And people always smile when they see it and I get tons of looks driving down the street.  

But enough about what it looks like, you say, how does it drive?  Well, I have only put 2600 miles on it (I have had it for 7 weeks) but I can honestly say it drives very well.  It responds quickly when I change lanes and I don't have to turn the wheel very much to do so.  The brakes are excellent and respond well in rainy weather.  It does bounce a little over really bumpy roads but much less than most small cars.  And with the front, passenger, and side impact airbags, this car will protect you in an accident.

From the heated rear windows and heated front seats to the sunroof and leather interior, this car has a lot of luxury to it.  There are 2 power outlets (one can be made into a cigarette lighter if you are a smoker) and lots of other cute little things that are also very functional.  I also think it is very roomy and that is what surprised me the most.  I am no Kate Moss and I find the front seat very spacious.  My 6'4&quot; cousin had no trouble riding in the front seat (he was about an inch too tall for the back).  

The car is not perfect though. The cupholders are pretty useless and it doesn't come with a compass (something I have noticed in other German car giants like BMW). All things considered, I will happily take these two &quot;problems&quot; for the wonderful car I get in return.,

If you have a big family, this is not the car for you.  If you are looking for a fun, reliable, luxury car (without the luxury price), then consider a New Beetle.  You will never want to drive another car again!<br><br>
