            I want everyone to know how much we enjoy out 2002 Tahoe.  We purchased this SUV about 1 year ago and needless to say it was a great choice.  Our previous vehicle was a Jeep Cherokee and we enjoyed that but this one takes the cake.  I know we had the option of the Suburban to gain the extra cargo space but for a family of four the Tahoe has worked out extremely well.  We have the 5.3 liter V8 which gets up and goes when ever you ask it to.  The vehicle is equipped with a sensor for everything and at times I think may be smarter than we are.  Overall a great vehicle, reasonable with gas about 300-350 miles per tank (26 gallons) depending on the type of driving.  We opted for the LS model so our vehicle is without a cassette player, which requires a whole other console just below the dash, it also came with cloth versus leather which we are very happy with, and we don't have Onstar which is an option that may not be practical for all buyers anyway. Seats are fully adjustable both driver and passenger which includes lumbar support, comfortable for long drives. Standard equipment of course power everything, rear defrost, in dash CD player, nice sounding speakers, Cruise Control.  There are nice features like plenty of cup holders and the quick and easy removal of the 3rd row seats.  Plenty of towing power, we pull a 17' boat with ease the tow/haul mode makes it even smoother.

I am not an expert, just an average consumer but my overall opinion is the vehicle is outstanding and we believe in the quality of Chevrolet (as loyal customers).  A great value even for the $32,500 price tag.

YOU WILL LOVE IT.
