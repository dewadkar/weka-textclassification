            The Ford Escort is the best small-sized car on the market.  The gas mileage is astounding!!!!  When I first got an Escort, i thought that it would be like any other small-sized car.  I thought that it would be weak, but it's not!! The 1.9 Liter engine is plenty enough to get the car up and going in a relatively short amount of time.  Although, the performance with it's maximum passenger load lacks the kick that it needs when you have 1 person.  I would recommend the 5-speed manual transmission for the Escort, because it gives you an extra couple of miles to the gallon.  The gas mileage that I get in that car is awesome!  I get somewhere around 25-30 miles to the gallon!!!  It's really helps me out when it comes to gas money. All-in-all, I think the Escort would be everybody's best bet if they want to save gas and still have a considerable amount of power.<br><br>
