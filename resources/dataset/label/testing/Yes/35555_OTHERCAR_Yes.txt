            I recently purchased my AIPTEK VGA pen cam from a local Wal-Mart.It holds 26 pictures in High Res. mode, and 107 in Low Res. The picture quality is unusable in Low Res. mode. I don't even know why they include that. The picture quality is not perfect but better than I expected for the $40 price tag. The included software is very easy to use. This cam really needs a flash. Other than that it scores high on the cool factor scale. I really recommend looking into the Vivitar Vivicam that Wal-Mart now sells for $50. It includes a built on flash. The Pen Cam is more compact, so if size is the only issue get the AIPTEK. Otherwise get the Vivitar. They have the same resolution and both have 8 megs of storage.
