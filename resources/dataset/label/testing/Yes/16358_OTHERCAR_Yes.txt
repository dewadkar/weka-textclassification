            I bought a Hewlett Packard C200 digital camera a couple months ago. I didn't want to spend much because I wasn't sure if I'd like it. $100.00 rebate on the site helped me decide! Surprisingly this camera is affordable, easy to use, and takes incredible pictures. You can see the picture before you take it, no film to buy, no complicated buttons, lightweight, and the pictures are very nice quality for having prints made. The only thing I recommend doing when you buy this camera is to buy the adapter for downloading images onto your computer. It takes a whole set of batteries to download one time. This can add up quick when the pictures are so easy to take! <br><br>
