            When I purchased my 1999 Nissan Sentra GXE at first, I was a little skeptical about it and I certainly didn't care for the looks.  For the price though (it was roughly $2000 cheaper than comparable cars), I decided to go with it.  I'm certainly very pleased with the car itself.

This car has very decent gas mileage (27 MPG city/36 MPG highway), is roomy for a compact car, and the acceleration is acceptable for a four-cylinder (1.6 liter, automatic) engine.  It handles very nicely in sharp turns, but can get shaky with higher winds.

I would certainly recommend this car for people who are looking for a inexpensive reliable car, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for those who want a lot of power or space.  It's great for college students and those who like to save a buck.  If you've got money to burn, I certainly recommend something more robust.<br><br>
