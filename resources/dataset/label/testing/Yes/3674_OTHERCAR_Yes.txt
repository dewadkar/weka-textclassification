            The Oldsmobile Silhouette is one of the most comfortable and reliable vans on the market. It is stylish and has plenty of space for the kids. The seats can easily be removed to allow more cargo room and the mid bucket sets are some of the most comfortable my butt has had a chance to sit upon.

It drives incredibly well for a minivan and has a lot of top end acceleration in the 3800 model. When trying to pass it responds with the grace of a Cheetah. It is also very stable going into curves due the rugged suspension that Oldsmobile has equipped it with. I just love the way it looks just as much as driving it. 

It has a sporty look about it(3800 with side skirts and rims, fully loaded) that looks like something the space community would drive in. The automatic sliding door is another plus that I greatly appreciate because I have kids and it can be a pain to open up the door and close it every time the entered and exited the van.

It is also very compact for a minivan one of the roomiest on the market. It is loaded with features that we all love. It has removable bucket seats, is very spacious, has electric seats , an great sound system, seats that are easily cleaned(leather or vinyl), and an overhead console with navigational system and thermometer.

You will love this tight package on the road on long trip and on short trips to the supermarket. It is very road worthy and deserves recommendation for one of the best minivans on the market to date. <br><br>
