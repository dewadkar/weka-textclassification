            I have racked up 5000 miles on Alero and I think GM has come along way. In 1990 I was working for an Olds/GMC dealer and saw hundreds of GM cars fresh from the factory and I was disappointed by the quality. 

I wasn't really thinking about the Alero when I started looking for a new car. After looking at the accord I swung by the Olds dealer just for the heck of it. What a nice surprise it was to find the Alero. It had a far better quality to it then the Olds I had seen in 1990. It actually had a Japanese quality feel to it. The 90's had been a time of big change in the US Auto Industry and this 2000 Alero shows that American Auto Manufactures are back. 

The Alero is great for those who enjoy a sporty ride, but have to have a car for the family. I am 5'10 and fit just fine. If you are over 6ft tall you will want to avoid the potholes and speed bumps if you value your head. Don't plan on taking more than 4 people in this car. I would not put an eight year old in the center back seat. Trunk space is very good. The seats are firm. 

If you like the cushie Cadillac soft ride, then don't buy this car. The non-sport suspension is firm and the sports suspension is very firm. This helps the Alero handle very well, but it makes you cringe when you see bumps ahead. This is true with any of the sports sedans in this price range. 

Don't even think 4 cylinders. Even with gas prices pushing up, the 4 cylinders is not that big a gas saver and that V-6 is one the best reasons to get the Alero. 

Gizmos on the Alero include a tire pressure dash display and a computer that tells you when the oil needs changing. The stereo speakers a respectable, but the CD player needs the anti-skip memory. That firm suspension of the olds makes the CD player jump frequently. If they had the 10-second memory chip like Sony uses you would never know it the CD skipped. For a car that costs over $20,000 you would expect a better CD player.

One other flaw in the Alero is the leather seat. When GM designed the Alero they didn't account for the slightly larger leather seats. The passenger seat rubs the center console. If someone sits in the passenger seats then everything is fine. It is a minor flaw, but I expect to see wear marks develop over the next 6 months from rubbing the center console.

Wind noise is average. The Camry was had less wind noise the Alero, but it was dull ride. I really enjoyed my 1986 Cressida and would of gone Camry, but it just wasn't fun to drive. If you are looking for the quietest ride in this class of cars, then Camry is great. You will pay a couple of thousand more for a V6 Camry, but it is a good car. I hope the Alero serves me as well as my Cressida did.

I would skip the rear wing option. It looks like a cheap add on. The chrome rims look sharp. You may want to get an after market CD player. Just make sure you get real pros to install it. The last CD player I had installed was done great. It was just a shame they didn't know how to put my interior body panels back on the right way. I never was able to get the interior back to like new after that CD player was installed.
