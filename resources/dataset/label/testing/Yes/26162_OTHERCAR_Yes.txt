            The Sienna and Odyssey will likely be duking it out for first place honors for years to come.

I'll start off by saying we ultimately brought a Honda Odyssey as it felt more like our old van to drive and we liked the larger space.  However we spent a good bit of time looking at the Sienna as well.

The one we were considering was the LE model with all the power options, middle captains seats, rear air.  Toyota offers some beautiful color options on the Sienna (all their cars actually) which is something Honda doesn't so if you want a blue minivan you've gotta go Toyota.

The main thing I didn't like about the Toyota was the way the van handled.  Power was very plentiful and smooth but I found the gas peddle too light.  The ride was also "bouncy" as though the shocks weren't working right.  I was also surprised by the amount of body roll when cornering.  We have an older Plymouth Voyager and I'm very used to the wide stance and stability of that minivan.  While the Sienna looks about the same overall it just didn't feel as stable on the road.

Controls etc are well placed and easy to reach.  Visibility from the drivers seat seemed restricted over my left shoulder but the mirrors are well placed and give good rearward views.

Rear seats fold and tumble forward but not all the way so you don't gain as much space as you might want.  The seats are quite light though and easy to remove.

My wife very much like the Sienna and if the dealer had been more willing to bargain on price I'm sure we'd have ended up with the Sienna not the Odyssey.

Overall I can't say you'd be disappointed if you get a sienna.  Certainly we see many on the roads but if like me you think it feels small and rolly then check out the Honda.
