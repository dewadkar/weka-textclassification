            I test drove almost every SUV on the market under $30,000 before choosing the Tribute--am I glad I waited for it!!  I first saw the Tribute at the auto show in the spring and I knew then that I had to delay my new car purchase until I could drive one.  When I finally did take the test drive on Labor Day weekend, it was love at first sight!  The second I sat in the vehicle I knew it was the one for me.  

First, the Tribute is the only SUV that had all the options I wanted (power,sunroof, V6, reclining back seat that also folds down, remote entry, alarm, premium sound system with dual media--cassette and CD; I got the 6-disc-in-dash-CD player IT'S THE BEST PART)!!  This car also handles like a car and feels like one when you sit it in except for the wonderful height advantage you have which enables you to see more.  

Since the Tribute was truly the first joint venture between Mazda and Ford, I knew the quality would be outstanding.  For example, at my &quot;new owner appreciation party&quot; at the dealership I found out that the Tribute has Mustang brakes on the front and 626 brakes on the back to give it the best braking ability possible.  It also has the same air conditioner unit that is in the Ford F350 pick up truck!  The two companies basically picked the best parts from each warehouse and developed a truly superior SUV but kept it affordable. 

Truly the best thing about the Tribute is it's value!  Most of the SUVs on the market right now are totally overpriced for what you get, but the Mazda Tribute is the exception!  So for anyone considering purchasing a new car I 100% recommend this one--it seats 5 comfortably, but you can still parallel park it!<br><br>
