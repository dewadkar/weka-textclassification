            The Kodak DC 260 produces excellent images up to 8x10 inches.  The camera fits comfortably in the hands.  Operational controls are well placed.  Batteries and flashcards are easy to load and unload.  The optical viewfinder is small but is bright enough for use in dim light. 

The small playback screen automatically converts vertical images for horizontal viewing, which is a plus.  But the images on this screen are too bright to show detail.  

It takes practice to get used to the camera menus, but once that is accomplished you will appreciate the camera's features.  These include control of the built-in flash; setting image resolution to one of the three available settings (use &quot;high&quot; for the best quality).  I especially like having the option to use professional flash units via the camera's electronic stobe light plug connection (although having to &quot;step&quot; through the menu every time I need this option is somewhat annoying). 

The 3X zoom lens produces very good images.  Optional lens kits are available through Kodak.
