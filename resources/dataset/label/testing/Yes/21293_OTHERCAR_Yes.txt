            I had the chance to drive a 1992 Camry about a month ago when a friend of mine asked me to drop her off at the airport and keep her car at my house while she was out of town.  This was my firt every Toyota Camry drive and i absoultely loved the car!  Well, I didn't love everything, but I'll ge to that.  The overall ride quality and level of comfort in the car is amazing!  You feel like you're floating 2 feet abouve the ground.  The engine is hardly audible at 70 mph and the tires don't make that road surface noise like in most Japanesse cars.  The transmission is whip cream smooth..shifts are not detectable unless you keep an eye on the tach..  The enigne is a bit weak..I believe I drove the base model with the 2.2 4 cyl.  I have this same engine in two cars I own...1991 Celica and 1991 MR2...which are reasonable fast...but here..the added weight of a sedan is a bit too much for the 130 ponies to handle.  But hey, it's a family car..not a persoanl coupe, so I can't complain there.  The interior is nicely done and very no nonsense in style.  However, the extensive use of monochromatic plastic looks a little cheap and American economy car like.  Overall, I loved the car.  In fact, the night I brought it home, I was actually considering trading in my Acura Vigor for a Camry.  I'm not going to do that because I love the Acura (for other reasons...rarity being one of them), but I plan to buy a Camry sometime in the future.maybe the 1994-1996 Camry coupe...that's a pretty rare style.  For some reason, I just don't like to own a car that I see someone else driving every 5 minutes.  Also, I think Carmy is a pretty bad car when it comes to theft..it's #2 on the list of most stolen in my state...sooo can't get the sedan with parts the thievefs crave..just kidding...I'm just trying to justify getting the coupe version when I fell in love with the sedan. =) <br><br>
