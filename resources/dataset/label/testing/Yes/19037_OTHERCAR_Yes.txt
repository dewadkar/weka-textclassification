            Much like everybody else, I had no clue what in the world I wanted once I proclaimed to myself that a digital camera was for me!

However, after a good month's worth of reading every review (a couple times each), going to the stores and playing with each camera, and analyzing the subtle differences between each one.  The C2020 Zoom simply had no comparison.

From its compact design to its ease of use, this camera has it all.  That's right, I said EASE OF USE.  Every single review I read about this camera has complained about how complicated it is to use.  But you know what?  IT ISN'T.  So sure, it doesn't have a different button for each and every option, and sure it doesn't take you by the hand and tell you how to push the shutter-button, but in this world of high-tech gizmos, I think it is nice to have something with that many fewer parts to accidentally break, push, or do whatever to.  As long as you read the directions, it is very easy to use.  And you know what?  You're paying A LOT of money for this.  Shouldn't you read the directions, anyway?

Besides, if you want it to do something only a professional photographer would do, then you actually have to go out of you way to turn off all the auto settings.  

The picture quality on the HQ setting (which is the default) is UNBELIEVABLE!!  I've found that it actually makes the colors more vibrant than a conventional camera.  And the battery life was completely shocking.  Either I'm used to the rechargable batteries of days past and technology has passed me by, or this camera barely uses any power whatsoever.  And if you choose not to use the LCD, then forget about it...  I once shot about 300 some pictures over a week of vacation and never once had to replace or recharge them.  I couldn't believe it!!  

There is only one drawback, as far as I'm concerned, and that's the cost.  I'm the kind of guy who still likes to hit the bars with my college buddies and still heads on back to campus for football games.  Unfortunately, the camera doesn't come with me.  I'm always too darm scared that I'm going to either damage or lose it.

One word of advice, though (regardless of which camera you buy).  Get yourself at least a 16 meg photo card.  That will hold about 40-some pictures, plenty for any single event.  I like to then carry about the 8 megger that came with my camera, just for emergency backup.  But the more capacity you have, the more free you will be to snap away (since it's not like you're wasting film).  The more pictures you snap, the better the odds are that you get actually get a couple good shots.

Otherwise, though, this camera is the top.  I think it is great for everybody, and I still have yet to see a bad picture which wasn't my own fault. <br><br>
