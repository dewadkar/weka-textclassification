            <p>I had just paid off the loan on my previous car (a Subaru Impreza Outback) when I saw the C-70 float by in a Volvo commercial. I became obsessed. The price, new, was outside of my range -- around $45,000 in the spring of 2002. I searched for used ones in my area and located one in a gorgeous shade of blue at a dealership.
<p>My car history isn't stellar -- I'm not a driver, not an enthusiast. I've owned a Fiat Spyder (my first car), a Suzuki Samurai (cheap during a poor phase), and the Subaru (a great car!). The Volvo convertible harkened back to my youth while providing all the safety features that the Fiat lacked. My decision factors in buying this car aren't based on engine size, torque, or any of that stuff. I considered, aside from sheer good looks, Volvo's reputation and the feel of the thing when I test-drove it.
<p>That said, I must comment on the turbo. A friend of mine who's a long-time Volvo owner has complained that his current car does not have turbo. He insists that the ability to accelerate quickly is a safety feature. So when I'm trying to get into traffic on the Hutchison River Parkway where the entrance ramp is non-existent, I hit the accelerator, the car leaps out there and joins the stream of cars without hesitating, and I mutter "safety feature." Seriously, it is a powerful car that has pulled me out of tight traffic situations more than once.
<p>Although it was mentioned in the description on the web, when the salesman opened the door and I saw the tan suede and leather interior I astonished. It was gorgeous! I could not quite get my head around the idea of owning a car with a suede interior.
<p>I got over that quickly. I drove to a nearby park and figured out how to put down the top. I think the mechanized roof was the final straw for me -- I had to have it.
<p>That was about 18 months ago and we're still together (unlike the boyfriend who went with me on the test drive). We've had the usual challenges of a used car relationship: a few months after purchase I had to spring for break work. And the low-profile tires are a disaster on the roads of NY City. I've spent more on tires and a new rim (when one actually cracked in a pothole on the Van Wyck Expressway) than anything else. More recently a front strut mount wore out, and I bent the power antenna in the garage at work, so it needs replacing.
<p>The suede is a challenge to maintain -- it now has some water stains from rain pouring while passengers were loading (because the seats move sooooo slowly). But I still love the feel of it. 
<p>The rear seats, once you get the seat forward enough to get into them, are very roomy for a convertible. This is because the top folds down into a compartment in the trunk. The trunk is still fairly roomy, but it's a very oddly shaped space. You could not, for example, get a suitcase into it. Amusingly, it has the standard Volvo internal ski rack (an opening into the passenger compartment so you can slide your skis up the middle of the car). I've seen these work well in other Volvo models, but never tried it in mine.
<p>The audio system is huge -- 10 speakers, AM/FM, cassette, three CD changer in the dash and six more in the trunk. The receiver has that cool auto-search for content feature, as well as a news flash seeking feature. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell few of the radio stations around me send the appropriate signals so it searches in vain. No matter, the sound is fantastic. And it automatically adjusts the volume levels and treble/bass balance when you raise or lower the top. 
<p>My car's "Nautic blue" body and black top draw stares everywhere, and with the top down the blue and tan look is even sweeter. Although it was four years old when I bought it, it looked brand new, with just a couple scuffs on the rear bumper. It has more scuffs and dents now, but when it's washed and waxed it still looks nearly new. This is probably more because of the beautiful bodylines than the paint condition.
