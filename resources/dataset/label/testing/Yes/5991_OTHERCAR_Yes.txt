               I have had my GMC Suburban for 3 years. It was not new to me, but I couldn't love it any more. It is reliable, comfortable, and indispensable! I am constantly loading children, schoolbooks, groceries, and other miscellaneous items into its roomy interior. Those late night trips are so much more pleasant when family members can stretch out for a snooze. 
   This is my second suburban, and the first one had a tailgate. I enjoyed having the tailgate to picnic on, but we did experience some problems with the window and latch. The rear doors on our current model have given us no problems.
   The electrical system has had a few glitches, but we expect a great deal more from it with cell phones, CD players, and the like. Its age (it's a '93) probably has something to do with that.
   Tight parking lots can be tough,( and parallel parking is a bear!) but the deer lease holds few limitations.
   We have been replacing a few things - like alternators and water pumps - but at 150,000 miles, that's not too shabby.
