            I made about the biggest jump imaginable when I traded in my dependable but tired �90 Escort for a �95 Aurora. I fell in love with it from the first test drive � especially when I realized it was several thousand dollars less than a new Intrigue (and a substantially better car).

My wife calls it &quot;the ultimate in creature comforts.&quot; With its 250-hp engine (my first V-8 since high school), ultra-smooth 4-speed automatic transmission, the best seats I�ve ever ridden in and a &quot;set and forget&quot; climate control system, it�s a true joy to drive, whether on a 20-minute commute or a 1,000-mile road trip.

That said, I�m very glad I purchased this car with a good balance remaining on its 4-year, 50,000-mile warranty. In just under two years I have replaced an electric window motor, a door lock mechanism, and the traction control/ABS system sensor. In addition I have replaced both rear door ashtrays (for covers that wouldn�t stay closed), a broken hanger hook, a cracked walnut center console insert, and a cracked taillight lens. I also had to replace the rear window trim after a corner molding came off in the power wash. While all of these repairs were covered under warranty, it is clear that Oldsmobile should have spent more time addressing fit and finish issues on their flagship vehicle.

Used low-mileage Auroras are very reasonably priced � $16K to $19K in my area � due to high depreciation; however, even with the warranty this is not an inexpensive car to drive. While my Aurora gets good mileage for its size (19 mpg in city driving and up to 29 mpg on very long road trips), the premium fuel requirement is a pain in the pocket, especially at today�s gas prices. You�ll use 8 quarts (!) every time you change the oil, so plan on spending more at your local quick-lube. And, replacing the Aurora�s P235 tires will cost you at least $550 because you have very few choices in that size (I recommend the Michelin Pilot series). 

Still, there�s no denying this is a car that turns heads and makes a definite statement about its driver � which means a lot to me. Now that my warranty�s expired I may sing a different tune if the trips to the shop resume...but for now I�m just enjoying the ride.
