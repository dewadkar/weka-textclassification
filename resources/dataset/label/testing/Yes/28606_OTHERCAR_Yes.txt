            When I first purchased my Saab in 2000, I knew I wanted a convertible, and I had been looking at other luxury vehicles such as the BMW 5 series and Mercedes roadsters.  I quickly came to the conclusion that I couldn't see spending $20K+ on a used vehicle, even if it did have a prestigious German name.  That's when I started looking for alternatives and I happened upon the Saab 900S.  I don't know why I hadn't considered a Saab sooner!

My 1996 Saab 900S is everything that I was looking for in a car and more.  It has a beautiful body with a design that has thus far proved to be timeless - the current Saab 9-3 and 9-5 styles look almost identical!  The soft leather interior has continued to remain in excellent condition.  Unlike most other convertibles, the backseat of the Saab 900S is comfortable and spacious - even for 2 full sized adults.  And the automatic canvas top is the model of both form and function - it looks great, doesn't leak, is quick (open to shut in about 30 seconds!), and hasn't had any of the motor burnout problems that seem typical of the 1995 Saab 900S.  Finally, the car has all the features anyone could want - power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, keyless entry/trunk, telescopic steering column, automatic transmission, cruise control, ABS, dual airbags, heated seats and headlamps with wipers, alarm, and a Saab standard 6 speaker stereo system that sounds great with the top up or down.  The onboard computer display reports temperature, miles per gallon (which typically averages 20+ city and 25+ highway), distance to empty, and diagnostic messages (such as low coolant, low oil, and even when it is time for a Saab recommended service) and doubles as the radio readout.  The car even has a unique "Black Panel" feature which turns off all the lights on the dash except for the speedometer, making for an incredible futuristic nighttime driving experience.

During the 2 years that I have had this vehicle, I have only needed to do standard maintenance procedures such as oil changes and 15K and 30K services.  Using Saab original parts and filters has been a little bit more expensive, but I truly believe that it is worth the few extra dollars to avoid more costly repairs in the long run.  However, the somewhat more expensive maintenance and the sometimes slower than desirable acceleration are about the only downsides to the car.  I purchased the vehicle with 85,000 miles and the 30K+ miles I have put on it since have been some of the most enjoyable I have ever spent driving.  I highly recommend the 1996 Saab 900S convertible to anyone who is seeking a comfortable, fun, and luxurious vehicle at a less-than-luxury price.
