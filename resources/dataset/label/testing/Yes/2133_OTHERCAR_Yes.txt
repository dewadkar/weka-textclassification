            I bought this car a few months ago, it's a 1993, and I absolutely love it! It's basic, it's simple, it doesn't have all the power windows, power door locks, or any of the extras, but the thing runs really well! I have a brand new baby that I totally trust riding in the car.  It's nothing fancy, and nothing special or extra, but it's a really decent car and at an excellent price! I only paid $2500.00 and it gets EXCELLENT gas mileage. Especially with $1.90 per gallon right now. I really like the simplicity of it.  I don't have to bring it in to get the computer fixed on it, because it's all manual. (Door locks, windows, not transmission) The tape player didn't work when I got it, but that could have been the guy that had it before me's fault.  But other than that, I have absolutely no complaints!
VERY nice car!!!<br><br>
