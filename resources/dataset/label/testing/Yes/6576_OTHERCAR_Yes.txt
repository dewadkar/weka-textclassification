            I was 23 years old and a recent college graduate.  My Ford Escort that been my transportation through school now had 120,000 miles and the brakes were beginning to go.  I test drove a lot of cars but none compared to the smooth comfortable drive of the Honda Accord.  So I took a loan and I had my first new car!  It was a 1990 Honda Accord
LX.

138,000 miles and almost 11 years later, it still gets me around just fine.  Now that I am married we use it as our 2nd car.  I drive it about 10 miles a day to the bus stop and back. Occasionally, we take it on trips around town or 1-2 hour highway drives.

<b>Features</b>
My LX coupe has all the standard features:  A/C, automatic,
am/fm/cass, power locks, mirrors, and windows.  I find the car comfortable for driving by myself or 1 passenger.  Adults will find it tight in the back seat.

<b>Maintenance</b>
Besides regular maintenance like tires, batteries, oil/filter, and scheduled service (see my note about scheduled below).
38K - front brake pads
44K - recall service on transmission and trunk springs.  
52K - stalled and got distributor replaced (done for free due to recall)
59K - replace alternator
91K - A/C leak ($250)
93K - seat belt recall
99K - car died on highway.  Dealer fixed ignition coil ($26)
104K - front brake pads and muffler/exhaust ($240)
117K - resonator (exhaust component) replaced
135K - replace master brake cylinder (around $250)
137K - replace ignition switch to resolve starting/stalling/electrical
problems (around $150)

Honda recommends scheduled maintenance every 15K miles and I
think it is a bit pricey.  For example, I paid $1000 for the 90K service which included new timing belt, water pump and other minor 90K service.  I consider this only a minor downside as the reliability has been excellent in my opinion.

Beware, if you are buying an older honda, make sure that the timing belt and water pump has been taken care of, otherwise, you could get hit with a big expense.

<b>Still a nice car</b>
This car still handles and drives excellent.  It accelerates good on the highway.  I still like the way it smooth, comfortable, and quiet as much as it did when I got it new!

<b>Recommendation</b>
Even though it is 13+ years old, I would recommend this car to someone looking for a reliable 2nd car.  Good luck on your car search and I hope this helped.
