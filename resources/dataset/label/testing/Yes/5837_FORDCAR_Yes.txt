            A car is just a method of getting from one place to another right?  Not necessarily.  

My parents (both in their 70's ) decided that they wanted to purchase one final car.  They figured that they would have the car until they had to quite driving and depend on others to provide the transportation sometime in the far distant future. 

 What a surprise!  They chose for the first time a FORD product after reading that the Taurus was the best selling car and was well recommended by friends and experts alike.  

We found a 1992 wagon that was a demo model.  Electric everything, leather seats, what a dream of a car.  Or so we thought.  We had forgotten that some dreams are nightmares (or at least bad dreams) and that some cars although not lemons by law, are lemons by fact.  This was one of them. The biggest problem was that we could not get Ford to stand behind their product and assist us in discovering exactly what was wrong with this particular car. It was never the same problem but always something that meant the car was at the shop and the bill was hundreds of dollars each time.

Do we still have the car?  A resounding yes.  Dispite the many trips to the shop for repair this has still been a good car.   The drive is lovely, quiet, comfortable and enjoyable in all seats.  The ability to adjust the driver's seat to accommodate a 5'4&quot; 78 yr old and then change to fit a 5'10&quot; daughter is fantastic.  It carries loads to the recycle place as well as brush and leaves to the town location for pickup.  It has gone from the cold north east down to Texas and back without difficulty and again to Atlanta and back again without a problem.  

Would I recommend this car, well maybe not the 92 but I would recommend considering a newer model and perhaps you should be a bit mechanically inclined.<br><br>
