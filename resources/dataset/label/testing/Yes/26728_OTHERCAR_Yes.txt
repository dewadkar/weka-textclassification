            When digital cameras first came out, I was hesitant to buy one because I thought it was going to be just a short-lived fad.  One of the factors that turned me away from them was the very high price tag.  But over time, digital cameras have become more mainstream and the price has dropped drastically.  So I decided to go shopping for a digital camera in the 250-400 price range.  After comparing prices and options, I decided on the Olympus D-360L.  The Olympus D-360L has superb image quality with 1.3 megapixels.  For those of you unfamiliar with what this number means, it is more than enough for even experienced photographers.  This camera also offers an easy to use autofocus system.  All the buttons are on convenient areas of the camera.  The Olympus D-360L takes great, crystal clear pictures indoors and outside.  The 300 dollar price tag makes it a very appealing camera for people who have any level of interest in photography.
