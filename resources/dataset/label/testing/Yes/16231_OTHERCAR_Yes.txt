            When I found myself in the market for a new car last summer, there was little doubt in my mind that I would end up with a Toyota; and indeed I did.  This is the sixth Toyota our family has enjoyed and I must say, they just keep getting better! I traded in my 12 year old Corolla which had 130,000 miles on it and showed no signs of stopping.  I knew I was going to retire soon and felt that I should have a new car when the time came.  The car I chose is the VE; it has air-conditioning, AM-FM Cassette
and little else. There are two things I dislike about it; one is the absence of a trunk unlock lever in the car (opens with key entry only)
and the placement of the cigarette lighter under the beverage holder; it
is impossible to plug my cell phone in and use both openings in the beverage holder; very inconvenient when you have a passenger with a beverage.  I love everything else!!  It is good looking, handles with precision, is relatively quiet and the trunk space is unbelievably large.
It is a lot of fun to drive and gives me a sense of security with its quick response and good pick-up. 

Now I don't know who else should or should not buy this car.  I am an older lady who still likes to &quot;open 'er up&quot; out on the road, but my idea
of opening up a car and that same idea to myriads of others is undoubtedly
slightly different!  All I know is that the car brings me a lot of enjoyment, I feel relatively safe in it, it gets good mileage (roughly 24
mpg in town) and I know it will continue to be dependable...after all, it's a TOYOTA!!<br><br>
