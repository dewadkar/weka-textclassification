            We're definately a Toyota family. We own a 1988 Camry wagon, a 1994 Camry 4 door LE and a 1991 4x4 truck. I chose to review both Camry's at the same time so that you can compare their differences.

The wagon has over 160,000 miles on it and has only had 1 tuneup at about 85,000 miles. I believe the tuneups are scheduled every 60,000 but it simply didn't require one at that time. That's the only actual work it's ever had or needed other than routine maintainance such as oil, tires, brake replacements, etc. 

Surprisingly, for a wagon, it handles almost like a sports car, with flat, accurate and tight cornering. The acceleration is surprising from a v-6/auto, as some sports car drivers have found out the hard way. 

The wagon is perfect for the family that needs to carry more cargo than fits in a trunk. It'll never replace a van for the &quot;soccer mom,&quot; however. With its fold down rear seats, it can hold an impressive load of cargo.

The LE has the more powerful v-6 engine. It currently has about 80,000 miles on it and has yet to have a tuneup or any work whatsoever. While not having the sharp cornering of the wagon, the ride is plush and feels very secure. It'll comfortably hold 4 adults and the trunk is roomy for a car of its size. I feel it's comparable to the Lexus in fit and finish, for half the price.

I'm very impressed with both of them for fit, finish, comfort, attention to detail, ergonomics, etc. All the controls are right where you would expect them with no contortions required to operate anything (remember dash mounted light switches and floor mounted dimmers?). There's plenty of head and leg room in both and never a feeling of being cramped, even though they're not large cars. The reliability is exceptional when compared to similar vehicles of other makes driven by friends and family members.

There's really nothing I would change about either. They have good power, handling, style and storage. One small complaint holds true of most modern cars, and that's idiot lights instead of gauges. Gauges can warn you before you have a problem, while lights only let you know WHEN you have a problem. My other complaint is the CARDBOARD cover over the spare tire. I guess everyone needs to cut corners where they can, but CARDBOARD? 

The only real drawback I can see is the price. They tend to be higher than competitors models but you get what you pay for. Also I strongly dislike sunroofs and it was all but impossible to get a sedan without one unless special ordered. Mine has one and I still don't like it.<br><br>
