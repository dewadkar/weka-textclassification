            How does the expression go?  Take two, they're small?  After driving my Ford Contour for a couple of years, it came time to purchase a second family car.  After doing a little research, checking out a few lots, and the usual rigamarole involved in purchasing a new vehicle, I decided to go out an purchase yet another Contour.  Nothing has made me happier.

It's a very comfortable car to drive, roomy enough to get all of my goodies in it (everything from a trunk full of groceries to cross country skis diagonally across the inside) yet small enough that I can zoom into a parking space without feeling like I'm landing the Enterprise.  Maintenance has been little more than regular oil changes, minus some initial problems I had in the beginning on both cars with the wheel locks freezing up on me.  Admittedly, this was a pain to take care of each time, but both instances were covered under warranty and have been better since being replaced.  

The Contour gets good mileage and has decent pick-up for such a small engine.  Everything is within easy reach-- cup holders, controls, radio-- and the drive is always smooth.  Most of all, I have to applaud the fact that in all weather -- rain, snow, or sleet-- the Contour has never failed to start.  It's a car you don't have to think about-- and I think that's pretty terrific.<br><br>
