            When the engine on our Nissan Altima literally exploded at 95,000 miles, we asked the rental car company for a comparable vehicle to drive during the month Nissan took to replace the engine (thank goodness for extended warranties that cover rentals).  They gave us a bright red four door Alero. 

The Alero was a step up from the Altima.  Styling is subjective, but this car was just plain good looking to me, and I think it even turned a few heads in parking lots.  The world &quot;Oldsmobile&quot; appears only in small letters on the trunk lid.

Our car had an automatic transmission and the small inline four cylinder engine, so performance was not necksnaping, about the same as our Nissan.  A larger V6 is available.  The V6 doesn't have a lot more horsepower, but it is said to have much more low end torque, so it ought to give more farfignugen when you pull away from a stoplight.

The interiors of GM cars I've driven in the past often seemed thrown together pieces of flimsy plastic.  By contrast, the Alero had a very solid interior and showed some original thinking.  The key is back on the dashboard, a better place for it than the steering column.  The truck open button is recessed in the drivers door rather than hidden in the glove box.  The seats are comfortable, easily as well made as those in similar priced imports.   The cup holders are useable and the interior is well lit.  The cruise control and radio work well. The instrument panel has gages backed up by many warning lights. If you get low on fuel a light comes on and the warning chime sounds. The car has day time running lights.   

The automatic door locks try to think for you.  If you lock them with a door open, they wait 30 seconds after you close the door for the locks to actuate.  In this mode, the horn honks when the doors lock.  I found this silly, but experimentation reveled that if press the door lock button twice with the door open then the locks lock immediately.  

The rear seats will fold down to enlarge the already generous trunk.

We noticed no manufacturing defects in this low milage car.  This is the second new U.S. made car that was delivered nearly perfect, the other being our new Ford Explorer Sport, reviewed seperately.

From reviewing the newspaper ads and talking to some car-heads it appears that GM dealers will bargin on the price of these cars.

The Alero is clearly the equal of five passenger sedans from Ford, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan in comfort and build quality.  If the powertrain can hold up over time as well as the competition, then the Alero becomes an exceptional value.
