            When the Olympus D600-L works, it works really well, producing vibrant and clean images. 

However, there are a significant number of times when the camera just falls on it's face.  First off, it has a very long shutter lag, even with pre=focus.  Even if you push the shutter release half-way down and prefocus the camera, it still doesn't take the picture very quickly after you actually take the picture. 

The other time that the camera let me down is when you're trying to focus on a complex subject.  Often times the camera would indicate a focus lock and not actually be focused or would fail to lock at all, making it impossible to take the picture.  A split prism focus indicator would've been very helpful.

I wish that you could update it easier to use more than an 8 meg smartmedia card, but the 8 meg cards are so cheap that you can buy a few and usually not run out.

Other than that, I am pretty pleased with it.  I got mine as a refurb for less than $300, and I definitely think it was worth that much.<br><br>
