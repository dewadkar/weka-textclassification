            I was foolish and bought a '96 Neon and had it for a year and it started falling apart.  I decided since the warranty would be gone, it was time to trade it in.  I traded for a 1998 Red Saturn SC! It had 16k miles on it, and it was priced at about $14,000.  I had to pay a little more as I still owed on the Neon:(

The car now has 79,000 miles on it.  I had done all my tuneups and oil changes.  As someone else stated in another review, the dome light isn't well anchored.  Mine fell out also, but while I still had warranty, so they got it in there good now. I am not sure what tires it came with, but I had to replace them all at 30,000 miles, so they must not have been the best. I now have Pirelli's on there that should last for awhile. I also did have to get a new muffler this year.  I started hearing a thumping noise, like I had a body in the trunk.  I got under the car and saw that my muffler bracket was no longer there, and the muffler itself had a big hole in it.  I got the muffler reaplaced and re-anchored. The exhaust pipe and manifold were ok.

I got in an accident this past March.  A woman took a left turn right in front of me.  I hit her rear quarter panel with my front end.  My bumper came off, both air bags depleated (OUCH!) and my hood crinkled.  I was going about 40mph, no seatbelt and I was fine except for the nice airbag burns on my hands.  My car started up fine, and I got it to the body shop.  The real bad part here was that the actual damage to my car was not that bad and easily repairable.  The frame had a slight bend, but could be straigtened.  My ins. company totalled the car out because the cost to repair was $5,500, but that was because the parts were so spendy, mostly the airbags!.  They offered me $6,100 for market value, which, if I paid off the loan, would leave me with $300 and no car to trade in.  I decided to buy back the car for a salvage cost of $1920, and use the rest to fix it up.  With getting my deductible back, as I was not at fault, I came out $200 ahead with a new front end:) The guy at Abra saved me a lot of money by using used airbags, it cut that cost in half.

I was impressed though, at how this car held up in the accident.  40 mph is pretty fast for impact.  

Otherwise, I really like the car.  I am still on my original battery. ( I live in MN, so those cold winters are rough) It runs smooth, it shifts very easily.  My only complaints is that the trunk is shallow.  I have some speaker boxes back there, so that is partly my fault, but there isn't much "head room" in the trunk.  As for the backseat, nobody ever goes back there so I am not sure what the comfort level is. I would have liked to have the 3rd door so I could whip my school bag into the backseat.  To do that I have to trip the lever on the driver's seat, but it doesn't slide forward so I still have to stuff the bag in. 

Head and leg room are great if you have a short torso.  I myself am 5'11, but all my height is in my legs, so I have plenty of head clearence.  I would not ask my 6'4 uncle to ride with me! The front seat could use some lumbar support, my lower back aches like crazy after being in there for more than 2 hours. I did have some road/wind noise from the doors, but I got some stuff called "Vinyl Renew" at the hardware store and put that on all the rubber seals for the doors and windows and now it is silent again.  That rubber can rot with all the extreme weather. 

Gas mileage is ok, I think I get about 18-22 MPG.  I commute 38 miles a day RT and I fill up every 6 days. 

Overall it is a great car. I keep it clean inside and out. After my new front end, I have had 3 comments about how nice my "new" car is, and when I say it is 5 years old, they are shocked and tell me it looks like a 2003:) 

Insurance for me is about average, a little more than what I paid for the Neon, but less than the Cavalier Z24. Of course in MN, ALL insurance rates have jacked up.  I think I was paying $380 every 6 months (got the 25  discount!) and now it went to $470 because they claim all rates went up. My car payment is $315/month and I have just 15 more to go.  I hope this car can go well over 100,000  miles as I would like to keep it for a few years and not have to have a car payment.
