            Guess What I got for Christmas.....Ha Ha Ha.  Yes you guessed it Santa brought me one of these little dreams....  I absolutely love it.  A friend of mine bought one when they first came out.  I recently moved out of the state and she just had a baby.  I wanted to see pictures of her new arrival and she sent me some via computer.  I couldn't believe how great they turned out.  I actually thought that she had scanned some photo's and sent them to me.  When I asked her she had told me that she took them with her digital camera.  I have to say I was quite impressed.  I then printed the pictures out and was even more impressed with the quality.  I really have wanted a digital camera for some time but was worried about buying one that would give me not only quality but a decent price as I cannot afford to go out and buy the latest, most expensive version (ie, $700.00) of photo equipment.  I read many articles and opinions about different digital camera's and finally decided between the articles and the actual proof sitting in my hand I decided that this is the camera that I wanted.  When I got to checking around I also found out that the price had actually dropped to $149.00.  Well I all but begged my &quot;Santa&quot; to bring me this camera.  You can imagine my surprise when I received this gift 2 days before christmas.  Santa wanted me to be able to enjoy this gift for the family get togethors on the holiday.....lol.  

Anyway I have taken at least 150 pictures over the past 4 days and have been very pleased with not only the quality but the great way the camera handles.  First of all the screen that shows the picture after you have taken it, but the ability to run through all your pictures at any time is a great feature.  The ability to store anywhere from 30-300 photos is another bonus.  It was so easy to transfer the photo's to my computer or to disk whichever you choose is also so simple.  The software that comes with the camera is also a lot of fun, there are so many different things that you can do with the picture, I tell ya in that aspect it will give Adobe Photo delux a run for its money there.

The batterys seem to run a little on the short side, but never fear, all you have to do is plug the camera in with the supplied AC Adapter and your batterys will &quot;recharge&quot;...even though I am not using rechargable batteries.  You just might want to carry a spare set incase you are away from AC ADapter.

My recomendation for this camera is definately two thumbs up.  I would be more than happy to share some photo's with anyone that is having doubts.  As I know it is easier to make a decision when you have the proof sitting in your hands.  This is not the most advanced product on the line but It will provide you with good quality at a good price.<br><br>
