               As a proud new owner of a '92 Jeep Cherokee, I have found this to be a vehicle made for anybody. It does not matter what terrain or conditions you could be in, the Cherokee is definitely an automobile in which you can trust.
   When I was first out car shopping, I was looking for a Chevy Blazer. I saw a pathfinder that I wanted too, but Blazers have tranny problems and the pathfinder was rear-two wheel drive (not good for snow driving). My dad was with me and he had me test drive the Cherokee. I have to admit that I wasn't real thrilled with the first appearance. The white walls were out on the tiny 225/75R15 Good Year Decathalons were definitely a turn off and there were no options. It was onthe other hand extremely clean and had low miles, like 82,000. 
   It was not until the actual test drive that I decided that this was the SUV for me! It drove very smooth and did not have a whole lot of wind noise, which was good, because I'm going to be doing alot of driving to Cali and back up to Washington for college next year.
   Now I have to admit the best, but scariest part of this vehical are without a doubt the seats. They are so squishy, but they still give support, their amazing! Now my Jeep has no options, so anything that is an option (besides 4WD) I don't have. So that means that I don't have leather seats.
   One thing that I am very glad for is the way the 4WD works. Unlike the Chevy Blazer you do not have to stop to engage it or put it in neutral, all you have to do is pull the handle into 4-high when moving. Now you will want to do this when you are going under 50. This is very helpful in the snow. I have been doing alot of snow driving this year and I can't recommend a better vehicle for this besides a hummer. I have absolutely no problems what so ever. I am passing people on compact snow and ice doing about 50, but part of my grip might also be the BF Goodrich All Terrain Tires I bought recently. If your looking for new tires, look at all of the 4WD mags and you will see these tires everywhere! There are there for a reason.
   One last comment I would like to make is that there is no lack of power from the Cherokee. It is a 4.0 liter running an inline 6. It can produce 190 hp at 4750 rpm and the torque is 225 at 4000 rpm. So as you can tell it has the power required to do just about any thing!
