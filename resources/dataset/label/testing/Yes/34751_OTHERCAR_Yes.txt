            The Toyota Celica Supra and my Toyota Celica GT are the same basic vehicle - the sports car of the Toyota line.  The model I have has the R22-E imported motor, EFI far ahead of the competition, and sound as a dollar.  
I have owned this auto for 7 years and put many a mile on it. I got it with low mileage, and it's only up to 146,000.  For a Toyota, particularly with the imported engine, that's childhood.  Of the numerous 80's model Toyotas I have conversed with people about, they rarely need any engine maintenance until 200-300,000 miles, when most get a valve job and then go another 200-300,000 miles before the next one.  They are made to last. 

This model also surprised me with options; rear window defogger, tilt steering wheel (primitive, but tilt), and cruise (on a 5 speed manual tranny).  It still performs smoothly and handles GREAT, holding hills and corners like a cat.

In seven years, the only repairs made were 1) alternator, 2) muffler, 3) water pump, and 4) battery.  Not bad for an old lady. 

The only drawback I can't cure with a cushion seat is that it likes to form rust on the rear edge of the hatch; it's the first place to rust on this model.  But heah, 15+ years out in the rain can do that to you.
