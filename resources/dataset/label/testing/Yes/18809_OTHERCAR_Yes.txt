            A newer Jeep came into my life recently via a good friend in need of transportation, so I served as his chauffeur in his Dark Green 1998 Jeep Cherokee 4 Dr. First let's say he WORKED to acquire this Jeep as it is a rather unusual one in that it does NOT have 4 wheel drive. Yes, this Jeep's a 2 WD and has the very smooth 5 speed automatic transmission, split bench seats, AM/FM radio and electric windows and electric door locks. It is equipped with the famous, strong 6 cylinder in-line fuel injected engine as well. I wouldn't have this vehicle with a 4 cylinder engine, it needs either the in-line 6 or the V8. The V6 is to be avoided.

Compared to my own Jeep w/ 4 WD and the 5 speed manual transmission, this one is quieter, smoother, with a well damped ride. The Jeep also has far more get up and go than mine. It's actually VERY quick indeed! Mileage has been about 22 mpg in all kinds of conditions. 

Beyond those things the Jeep is very similar to my old one, once behind the wheel it's so much the same vehicle. No rattles, no shakes, the Jeep inspires confidence. It's roomy inside enough for 6 footers, yet the seats adjust well for smaller drivers. All controls are where they should be and easily reached. Would I buy one? If I were in  the market for a hauler, a car for everyday, with a solid stength that makes one feel safe every minute then this is the one! At 18,500 it is a real buy that'll last and last. My old one has 145,000 miles and shows no signs of wearing out anytime soon. Hurry before they're changed to something less.<br><br>
