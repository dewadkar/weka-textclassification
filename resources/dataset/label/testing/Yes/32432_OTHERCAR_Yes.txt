            The Honda Civic Hatchback 2 Door, is the car that I would like to buy when I grow up. I would like to buy this car not just because it looks good but it fits my needs.  It fits my needs because I'm a student and it helps me go to and from school each day.  The things I love about this car is it is small and compact, its has a lot of &quot;giddy up and go&quot;, and it look very cool.  To drive this car it would feel like I'm in heaven, I have dreamed about this car since I was little and my uncle let me drive it when we drove down to Mexico.  People should buy this car only if they have a small family maybe a wife and a kid because it is not as big as any other car.  <br><br>
