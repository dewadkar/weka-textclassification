            I've been driving this Green '95 Taurus for 2 and a half years and in that time span I've put 9,000 miles on it. These aren't just any 9,000 miles, these are 9,000 of MY miles. These miles include hairpin turns at 30 mph and pedal-to-the-floor acceleration. If my Taurus didn't love me so much it would have blew up on me. It seems to love leaving tire marks behind from its wide, sweeping skids. The greatest thing is the engine. The other day I looked at my oil sticker and it told me that I was 1,900 miles overdue for an oil change! Ha, I would have never guessed it by the way it runs. Even in the CT winter it is extremely reliable. This car has been treated like complete sh*t and, to say the least, IT LOVES IT!!!!! <br><br>
