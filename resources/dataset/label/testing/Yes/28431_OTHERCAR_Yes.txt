            We bought a 96 kia primarily because we wanted the security and warranty of a new car and could only afford a Kia or GEO.  

We have had some problems with our car, primarily the check engine light (it can't decide whether or not the engine needs to be checked)and the dash board (the placement is somewhat close to the window, which might not be a problem in some climates but in the south it burnt up and warped the first summer)  but to give them credit our dashboard was replaced under warranty and we haven't had any more problems. 

Another nice point about the kia is the service you recieve after purchase; they have a 1-800 line you can call for help if you should get stranded. 

The car is ideal for first time new car buyers, whom I believe it was designed for?  It is in no way a luxury car, the seats are hard and there is not much space, but with the extraordinarily good gas mileage and dependability - this car is ideal for a small family or young couple.<br><br>
