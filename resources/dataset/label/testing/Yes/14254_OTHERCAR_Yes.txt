            The Infiniti G20 is a fantastic bargain and very reliable. I have a 1991 Infiniti G20 with over 145,000 miles and absolutely no major problems. My sister has a 1993, brother and friend have a 1995 and we all love them. If you need a reliable car for your teenager or an affordable car for yourself, this is definately the car for you.  The four door car has anti-lock brakes and depending on which year it has airbags and most safety features other cars have. Any year model is a really bargain, the 1999 and 2000 model years have all of the luxury car features for the same price as a Honda Accord. 
The service of an Infiniti cannot be surpassed, a loaner car for as little as an oil change with a car wash on top of it. Everyone in the service department is extremely helpful and attentive. The sales teams in the dealerships I have been to are always nice and never pushy. A brand new 1999 or 2000 will be around 30,000 or less depending on features and it is worth every penny. When you compare the Infiniti G20 to the Honda Accord, there is no contest. The G20 is more comfortable, a better ride, better service and just as reliable, and the warranty is outstanding. 
I highly recommend the Infiniti G20, any year, new or used, to anyone.<br><br>
