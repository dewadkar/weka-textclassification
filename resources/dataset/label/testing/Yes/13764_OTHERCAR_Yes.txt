            Here I am one of the biggest die hard Chevy people you may ever meet, and what do I have sitting in my garage now?  Yes! My new passion of desire, my Dodge Ram 4x4 complete with a 318 V8! I Have loved the way they have looked since this new body style first came out, And ohhhhhh my &quot;lil&quot; girl turns some heads now! I installed a 6&quot; Rancho suspension lift and new rims complete with 12.5x33&quot; BFG's, and took it to a friend who will remain annonymous and had a complete un restricted exaust system put on.  My family and I just got back from a trip to Florida where I pulled our 22 foot travel trailer behind the truck, set the cruise for (well ok a little faster than I should have) and never even knew it was behind us!  The low end torque is awsome the interrior is extremely roomy and this thing rides like a dream!  My only complaint is the factory stereo is a little cheesy, however this may have been in part that I did not opt for the up graded sound system because I was going to install an aftermarket system anyway.  I must tip my hat also to the Dodge service people who have not yet said one thing to me about the alterations I have done voiding the warrenty! (I had a front wheel seal leak and they fixed it no charge even though the tires are over size and the suspension has been altered) Dodge has definatly won me over now!  My wife loves it so much I have a hard time getting to drive it myself, She has actually informed me that she now wants a truck, Well, I had to give a little...We are now looking at the Durrango and I am pretty sure she has her heart set on one of those!  But that is a different story.<br><br>
