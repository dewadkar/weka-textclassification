            I purchased this road-terrorizing monster without much debate. It is actually a '92 model that is much more attractive than the new ones. Naturally, I knew I wanted to buy a domestic car, because everyone knows that cars made in the U.S. are the most dependable automobiles!!! The Mitch also needed a car that would attract the broads like flys to a carcass. Anything short of that simply won't do. I'll evaluate the Mitch-mobile in 3 relevant categories.

PRICE/FEATURES:
I purchased mine used this year for $12,000, and frankly, I robbed the guy!!! The competition around this price range include Civics and Neons. But let's face it folks, the aforementioned compacts just do not provide the sexiness needed to compliment the Mitch.. This particular ride is loaded with options as well, with amenities including a cassette player and power windows. It doesn't have an air conditioner, but it's not really that hot where I live. OK, it is hot in La Verne. Incredibly so, actually. An air conditioner would have been nice, but for a $12,000 car, you would be hard pressed to find such a technology.

DEPENDABILITY:
How does one describe this car without using the term &quot;rock solid&quot;? This car is that dependable, folks. I've only had to bring it in 7 times. The much talked about American dependability comes into play here. I need a car that won't break down when the Mitch is getting it on, you see. This car provides that stability in spades. Most of the time.

LOOKS: 
This is where this car shines. The paint is a luscious Alpine White. The upholstery? Absolutely top grade vinyl. But to be honest with you, folks, the 13&quot; hubcaps are truly the stars of the show. They show off the manly profile of this babe-mobile in dramatic fashion. With my undeniable charms combined with this fabulous ride, it's with little wonder that I am forced to bat away adoring broads on a regular basis.

Bottom Line:
This Escort is more than a car, it is a personality and a friend. It really is much like Mitch in many ways: It's old, but doesn't leak too much gas. Also, it's got all the moves to please the broads.
