            I recently purchased a 2000 Civic Si-G coupe and I must say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Before I purchased the vehicle, I did some research on other vehicles roughly in the same price range as the civic. The list includes VW Golf, WV Jetta, Dodge Neon and Mazda Protege, all of which were around the $ 20,000 mark. The reason I went with the civic is because of the value that the civic offers for the money you pay. For about $21,000 one can get a fully equipped civic with ABS, air, power windows,locks and sunroof. Also included is a 6 speaker stereo cd system. All of these are standard features on every civic Si-G. The VW's which start at about $22,000 base don't even come close to matching the value that the civic offers. To get a Golf with the same features as the civic, would cost around $25,000. The civic has awesome handling and has some kick when you press on the gas. It offers a 127 Hp V-Tec 4 cycl engine that is great on gas. The interior is designed very well with easy to use controls and gauges. A bonus on the 2000 civic is the drivers seat which has controls for adjusting the seat height. What I was not happy about the car was that I had to pay extra for the floor mats, splash guards and a block heater. I believe that these should be included with the vehicle and not be purchased as extras. These are the reasons that led me to purchase the vehicle. If you would like more info, please feel free to email me at wassemk@hotmail.com and I'll give you what I can.<br><br>
