            When I purchased my Galant in 1998, i'll admit,  I was a little skeptical. Sure it was a one owner (an elderly lady from Greenbrier, Tennessee), but you never know what you are getting into. Considering it had 130,000 at the time of purchase, I knew I was making a risky decision, but I needed something quick, since I was short on cash. The car looked brand new, and the seats (actually the whole interior), were in impeccable condition. I thought what the heck. So I finalized the deal. Since 1998, i have put 45,000 more miles on the car. So far, no problems. With the exception of the infamous blue-grey smoke that appears from time to time. Funny though, the smoke appears after about 5 to 10 minutes worth of idling. Like in traffic, or sitting in the bank drive thru window. Of course, other than a little embarrassment, Im not that worried. I dont really expect to keep the car for more than about another 7 to 8 months, then I shall purchase another one. According to other reviews and reports, it appears to be a valve stem problem. Nothing needs to be done immediately, but I know its a sign of things to come. 

Overall, the car continues to give me trouble free driving. The car never hesitates to start. However, a cold engine sounds and feels quite rough at first, but after about 2 to 3 minutes of driving, it clears up. Also, upon startup, the transmission will kick into gear a few times and give you a nice little jolt. But again, after driving a few minutes, the up/downshifts become much smoother. Be careful not to throw the transmission from reverse to drive too fast. If you dont come to a full, non-rolling stop first,  you'll get a moderate form of whiplash. Ok, well not quite, but it'll give you a scare at least. I really should get a front end alignment, the car pulls to the right at speeds of 45 or greater. Otherwise, at highway speeds, the car feels quite nimble and light on its feet. I should opt for a wider, lower-profile tire however. The P195-70R14's look and feel much too small for the cars weight and dimension. If you can get a Jetta with 17" wheels, this Mitsu should at least come with some 15"'s. I know its an option at the time of purchase, but 14"s should never be offered for a car this size. 

One noticeable annoyance, though, is the headlight covers. Over time, the surface has turned into a brownish, scratched-looking haze. From a distance, they are very noticeable and give the car somewhat of a cheap look. No biggie though. 

Still kickin, though. 175,000 miles is alot. Especially for a car lacking a history of mechanical problems. Everything works. The A/C is VERY cold, the cruise control, all power windows, locks work just fine. All the taillamps and headlights still shine very bright. I honestly cant think of anything major wrong with this car! Other than the blue smoke issue, I have been very pleased. I have owned Fords and Chevys in the past, and I am by far happier with my Galant. Even though my Chevy was a brand new car! That says alot.
