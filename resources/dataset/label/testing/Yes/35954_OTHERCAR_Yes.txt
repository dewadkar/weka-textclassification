            This 1999 Honda Civic Sedan was not my first Honda purchase. In fact, the car that I was trading in was a 1995 Honda Accord EX. It had leather seats, moon roof, power everything, anti-lock brakes - the works. The only reason we were trading it in, was because I decided to go back to school at a college a good twenty minutes away, and would be putting considerable miles on our vehicle which already had close to 100,000 miles on it. No doubt the Accord served us well, but what we learned about the new Civic Sedan moved us in a different direction.

When we purchased the Accord in 1995, we paid extra for all of the options. We discovered that in the years since the 1995 models, Honda changed many things about the Civics and the Accords. The body styles are now very similar and the new Civic Sedan EX comes WITH power steering, cruise control, tilt, power windows and locks, CD player and moon roof. The EX comes with the Honda V-tech engine which provides a bit more kick than the standard 4 cylinder engine.

The only thing that I am not totally sold on is the cloth interior, which we could have upgraded for an additional $500+. I also miss the cassette player, but the 37 miles per gallon on the highway more than makes up for it! We bought the car four and a half months ago and already have close to 10,000 miles on it with NO problems! It's a SUPER student car!

UPDATE! I graduated school, and finished my first year of teaching. I commuted 40 miles each way to my new job, still with the same Civic! It now has over 60,000 miles on it and I still have no complaints. Let the gas prices do what they will, I can still afford to drive. Also, I have never had reason to take it to a mechanic, other than to change the oil! A great deal!
