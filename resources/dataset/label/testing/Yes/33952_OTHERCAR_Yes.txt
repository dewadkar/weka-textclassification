            I was always a great fan of the original Beetle, simply for the strange originality of the car, in consideration of it�s age.
      When the new Beetle (or �Millennium Bug� as it has become known), I didn�t like it to say the least. I was not willing to change with the times. I felt that a car that had been loved by so many people, for so many decades was an insult!
     But, as with all such things, I gradually grew to like it. In fact, I might even go as far as to say that I love it! It has such groovy and funky styling, that anybody who is not too old to give you a blank look when you talk about South Park, is duty bound to fall madly in love with the Beetle.
     It�s not too expensive either, costing around the $25 208 mark (�15 755), and will give 32.5 mpg, which will not leave you needing to fill up at every gas station that you pass.
     It�s a good solid car too, probably one of the most reliable in it�s class. It handles neatly too, and you can�t help feeling that you�re at the wheel of a sports car, yet it�s also very nimble around town.
     As for comfort, you will only be more comfortable in the Ritz, although the Beetle is probably quieter. 
     If however, you want to be able to sleep soundly at night, without the fear of waking up in the morning to find that your Beetle is windowless, you may wish to fit a good alarm, preferably something that has been Thatcham approved
