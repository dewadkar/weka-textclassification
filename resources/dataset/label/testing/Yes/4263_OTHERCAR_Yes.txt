            I'm not too appealed by the BMW three series. I've driven a 740, 750i, and a 540, and even though this is the least expensive of the class, I really don't see what's the point in having it. Luxury is allright, however it's roomy and cramped in the back. The car is a bit small, and it's comparable to a Mercedes C class and a Volvo S40, the S40's small as hell! Other than the size of this car that pisses me off, I really don't like the way it handles. It does go a bit fast, however the akward shape and the overall width of the car interferes with handling. It doesn't handle well in the snow at all either. I must say though that the interior is luxurious on the brighter side. The only person I would say that would enjoy this car is a new yorker who doesn't want to spend money on an 740, and feels cocky enough to drive a BMW in NYC, when you really don't even need a car. <br><br>
