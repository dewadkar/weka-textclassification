              My husband and I were looking for a car that would replace our van and yet be large enough to hold our family,while being economical to run. We decided on a LeSabre for many reasons. I liked the way it drove from the moment I sat at the wheel. It has a beautiful,smooth ride. It is so economical to drive. My fuel bill has been reduced by close to half.After driving the LeSabre I have noticed so many other LeSabre's on the highways ,so apparently others feel as we do. If I had to change something about it I guess I'd like to see greater back support in the front seat so that my husband felt more comfortable when he drove.Thanks to Buick for producing a car that is economical for a family to drive!If this one was used, I can imagine what a new one rides like.  <br><br>
