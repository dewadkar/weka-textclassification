            The Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 is a great value.  The quality and workmanship of the 99/00 model year has greatly improved--it is the best car Hyundai has built. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy a Sonata older than '99. I love the exterior styling (as compared to the bland Accord's and Camry's) and for the money you get alot of car!

Obviously, the car is at its best fully loaded with Option Package 13:  leather, moonroof, ABS, Traction control, Upgraded stereo/cd/tape, cruise, power seats,etc--all for approximately $18,000 including tax and tags!!! (good deals in Philadelphia region).

The car rides fairly well--it is quiet,stable and braking is good; but be warned that one does feel the bumps moreso than in an Accord or Camry(especially in areas with bad roads).  Yet, it is smooth sailing on the highway.  

I have had the car for 6 months and have accrued 12,000 miles.  No problems and the scheduled maintenances are fairly priced and much lower than for a typical Accord or Camry.

The Warranty is best in its class--10 years and 5 years roadside assistance.

I would recommend a fully loaded Sonata to anyone, and it makes a great choice for a  second car!  You definitely get a sense of luxury at half the price of luxury cars.  A worthy alternative to the other over priced vehicles. Driving is Believing!!
