            My husband and I purchased a lemon Jeep in 1998 and decided after two years and $15,000 later (some not warrantee covered) the Jeep needed to go to the &quot;great scrapyard in the sky&quot;.  We bought a 1998 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition. The only &quot;bell or whistle&quot; that it doesn't have is that feature that the car raises when underway and lowers when the car stops.  (I have no idea what that is called and I won't even make a guess!)   We absolutely love this car.  I was extremely nervous when I bought it as it is considerably larger than my Jeep.  I was nervous about how it would drive (would it move like the large hunk of steel that it was or would it ride smoothly?  Would the gas mileage drive us into the poorhouse?  Would there be too much room?) 

As soon as I began the test drive I knew that this car was going to take me home.  It drove just like a car despite is mammoth size.  It has a very smooth ride, even over railroad tracks and potholes!  We packed the Expedition for a trip to our lake house and we had more than enough room to put the third seat in, whereas in the Jeep we were packed to the gills!  We drove 145 miles to the lake...about 50 miles while we were there and another 145 miles home and I still drove around town for a week on the same gas!  I was amazed at the gas mileage despite the 5500 pounds that the car must lug around.

I can't speak as of yet about reliability as the car is brand new.  I do know that I bought the longest warrantee possible (6 years, 100,000 miles) so I do not have to worry about it for quite some time!

The only feature of the car that I am confused about is the overdrive shift.  I am uncertain why this was built this way and I rather do not care for having to turn the overdrive &quot;off&quot; before going anywhere.  An overdrive feature is for highway driving only...so why I have to turn it off to drive in the city is beyond me.  I feel that it should be turned &quot;on&quot; when needed.

I would recommend this car to anyone...not necessarily only people with families.  It is a wonderful ride, easy to maneuver even with its titanic size and it is fun to drive!  The gas mileage is of course more than a car, however you get the fun out of it!  =)
