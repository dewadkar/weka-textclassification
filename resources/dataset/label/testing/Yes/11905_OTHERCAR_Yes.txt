            Ok I'm on vacation here, and mom has this little digital camera.  I've been using it now for a week non-stop.  She says it cost her around $199, I'm thinking, that's pretty cool, but the quality must be sacrificed for that price!  I think I was wrong, and I think the most important thing to consider when you're buying a digital camera is what are you going to do with your pictures after they leave the camera....

Well here is my situation.  I love instant gratification, and this camera gives it to me.  Would I use this camera to take snapshots of my daughter's soccer team in action NO, do I use it to chase my infant around the house shooting pictures every 15 minutes?  YES!

I am not going to use these photos to print at all. If I were I think I'd go a different route, but I need to give te 780 it's due, even with low pixels it prints pretty decent on a great color printer.  The photos I have printed to an EPSON 700 printer have looked pretty good, no they won't be next years Christmas card, but for sticking on a bulletin board, they'll work!

I love that I can download them directly to my iMac (or Pc) and can then do what I please with them.  The software that came with the camera wasn't that great so we downloaded a shareware program called CameraAide and it works great.

Downloading the picutres is so simple, a kid could do it.  

The camera eats batteries like they're candy when it's downloading the pictures to your pc, so I would recommend the AC adaptor.  

My favorite part of using this for the past week has been that I can take pictures everyday, and have them on the web or emailed that same day to all my family and friends who aren't on the vacation with me.  And except for the cost of the batteries, I haven't spent and cent on developing or having to wait!

I'd say if your on a budget or don't need your camera for sophisticated output this would be an awesome camera to use!<br><br>
