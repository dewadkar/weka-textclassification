            Last year I purchased a Sony DSC S75 camera for work.  I determined I didn't need anything above 3.3 megapixel and I was enticed by the Carl Zeiss optics and my past favorable experience with Sony products.  I still have the camera, and love it, but condusive for continuous carrying it is not.

I knew I needed a small pocket camera that would take adequate quality pictures for my public relations events, would be small enough to carry and never leave at home, was simple to use and would not break the bank.  After researching for a few weeks I decided on the Dimage XT.

I have been more then impressed with the features that this Altoids box sized camera delivers.  The internal optical zoom is a Godsend as I feel that digital zooms are worthless.  The zoom arrangement negates the need to have a lens barrel protrude from the body, leaving sleek lines that do not hang up in pockets or invite damage from knocking against other objects.

I am no photography expert, not by a long shot.  I can not speak to the technical quality of the pictures.  I can speak to the asthetic quality.  No they are not the quality of a high end 35mm Single Lens Reflex, nor that of a 5 megapixel full sized digital camera.  However, for everyday occassions and enlargements up to 8x10, the camera is more than adequate.

Video and sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small device, although very resource intensive.  A 16 mb card only stores 40 seconds of high quality video and sound and approximately 2 and one half minutes of lower quality data.  It also records in MOV format (Quicktime) and it will not play on Windows Media Player.  There are freeware conversion programs available on a number of websites that will allow you to convert to AVI or MPEG formats and compress the file for emailing or webposting with ease.

I obtained mine from Beach Camera for $279.95 shipped and spent another $45 after rebates on a PNY 256 mb secure digital card from Staples.  For $325 you can't go wrong.

The only improvements I would suggest would be a protective case and a larger memory card bundled into the package.  In this day and age there is no excuse not to provide a protective slip case and at least a 64 mb memory card.  The 16 mb card is wholly inadequate and can only store one picture on the highest quality setting in which each file takes up 9 mb of storage space.
