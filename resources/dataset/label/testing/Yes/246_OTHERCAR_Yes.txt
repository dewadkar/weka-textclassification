            This camera represents the standard for 3 meg digital photography for under a grand. As a photographer with over 30 years of experience, this camera represents the high water mark of digital photography. It far exceeds the Nikon 990 (which was my first mistake in purchasing a digital camera). In fact, having used the D30 and other pro models, I can say categorically that the image quality is equal or better than the 3 to 5 grand models.

It is simply the best. The storage options, battery length, flash options, LCD screen, low light imaging, and fast glass make this camera an essential part of any photographers equipment.

The camera handles like a point and shoot but offers the quality, controls and useability of a professional camera. Lens attachments are available (Lensmate is recommended)and the Canon Speedlite series can be utilized.

Ultimately it is the image quality that counts to any real photographer, and even those on this site who do not recommend it praise the quality of the images it produces. For me, enough said.
