              I purchased my 1995 Acura in March of 2000 and have not had to do any maintenance except for changing the oil every 3000 miles. It has nearly 90,000 miles on it now and still drives like a dream. To put a trailer hitch on was a little expensive but was well worth the cost as it pulls my boat with no difficulty.  The hatch door in the back allows you to carry a large load when you put the back seats down. I have carried many large boxes that I could not have carried in a large sedan because of the large opening the Acura gives you when you open the back hatch.  

My Acura, is the limited edition and meet all my expectations. If you're looking for a good used car that has little maintenance, I would highly recommend one of these.
