            We bought a used 1993 Plymouth Colt Vista Wagon in 1995 for $11,000.  Now, as I consider using it as a trade-in, I found myself reflecting on it.

What I like best about this car is the generous space in a compact package.  We have hauled bags of soil & mulch, bricks, and lots of groceries in the hatch area behind the rear bench seat.  When we had to haul large items, we just flipped the rear seat forward.

What I like least is that the expanse of glass which provides such a great view, really takes in the heat.  A good tint job is needed.

The Colt was made by Mitsubishi and it's Japanese craftsmanship shows.  Even after years of use, the upholstery is undamaged and good looking.  The red paint has not faded.  

The one incident we've had involved tailpipe smoking.  The dealer service department cleaned the fuel injector throttle-body and it quit.  I was really afraid we had engine trouble, like a busted ring.  But, for the last three years, no smoke.

My concerns about the car now, in it's present used state are about the engine's future.  It has a timing belt which is scheduled to be changed-out.  I could spend as much on that as the car is worth.  It also leaks a little oil after oil changes.  One mechanic suggested a new head gasket would fix that, and that would tie in nicely with the belt job, but still it is expensive.  So right now I'm trying to decide whether to sell it, drive it to failure or keep it and do preventative maintenance.
