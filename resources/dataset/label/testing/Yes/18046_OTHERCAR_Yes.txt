            After pining for one nearly eight years now, I finally went out last week and bought one these beautiful cars. I bought a barely used (7,500 miles) 2000 Miata LS with all the goodies -- leather interior, tan top, Bose AM/FM/CD/Cassette, appearance package, etc., etc. For the aficionados out there, this car is just below Mazda's absolute-top-of-the-line Limited Edition model.

First of all, let's address a few things this car is not.

* Big on space: It's a tiny little convertible, OK, so don't expect much room for luggage. The trunk is pretty small (actually bigger than the previous -- 1990-1997 model -- Miatas), so don't expect to throw that extra-large, extra-stuffed Samsonite in it. Just won't happen. However, I have found it more than adequate for a quick grocery run.

* A smooth ride: Some people complain about the harsh ride on these cars. To them I say this: It's a sports car, what do you expect? If you want comfort, buy a Cadillac. A proper sports car should allow the driver to feel the road, and this one does so with precision. And yes, though the ride is tight, I have not found it jarring, even on California's infamous freeways.

* Practical: OK, maybe this is a stretch, but let me put it this way: If you have five kids and are looking for a family car, you may want to pass on this one. It's a two-seater, period.

Now let's get to what this car is. Fun, fun, fun. This little guy is an absolute joy to drive. It sticks to the road like nobody's business. Before buying this one, I rented a similar model last year in Maui, Hawaii, and drove the road to Hana -- in the rain. It carved those roads like a Thanksgiving turkey, even in the slick conditions I was in.

The manual top on this car is one of the easiest to put up and down. The time it takes to do so: about 5 seconds. Really. My only caveat here is that when driving with the top down, Mazda recommends putting the boot cover over the folded top. This adds to the time it takes before a blissful, open-air driving experience. First time took me about 10 minutes. I think I did it in 3 or 4 tonight.

Driving with the top up is fine too, and has turned out to be a much quieter experience than I had expected. Align those mirrors, though: The blindspot on the driver's side is a nasty one.

This car is peppy, to be sure, but the emphasis is on handling, not acceleration. In other words, don't go drag racing a Dodge Viper, should one roll up next to you. But you will have no problem at all getting on freeways. If I recall correctly, most of the major car magazines clocked the Miata's 0-60 second time in under 8 seconds when the 1999 models debuted. This is much better than previous models. Another major plus is that this car is rear-wheel drive. In other words, it's a sports car the way they were meant to be.

My car has a five-speed manual transmission. I have not driven an automatic Miata, nor do I care to. The Miata's manual transmission is consistently rated one of the best known to man. My friends, the gear shifter on this thing is a toggle switch in disguise. The throws are extremely short, and the clutch is very, very light. If you're a first-time stick-shift driver, prepare to be spoiled. For veterans out there, prepare to rejoice.

The car's interior is tight, but not exceedingly cramped, though it might be for those 6-foot and above. The sound system is good, but not great. This is mostly due to the fact that sound only comes from in front of you through the system's separate woofers and tweeters, and not from behind as well.

One thing I really like about this car -- and will like even more during Southern California's harsh winters (HA!) -- is this car's toasty heater. Go ahead and drive with the top down at night. As long as it's not 32 degrees outside, you'll probably be OK.

Conclusion: This is a car for my "Me" years. As a single 25-year-old, the Miata suits me to a tee. If you're looking for a fun, head-turning convertible with plenty of pep and a very reliable track record, look no further than the Miata.
