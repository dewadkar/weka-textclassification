            What some people won't do to get invited to a picnic.
Creature comfort: I have driven all 135,000 miles on this car. I am 5'8" 190 pounds. I found the front seat to be Very comfortable. The back seat is way to small for anyone but children. Adequate luggage space and with the fold down seat you can haul long items.  No problems with any of the electronics, air conditioning or radio. I like the ride quality and performance. Car will cruise at 85 no problem and will do all the Speedo says..honest officer I was going 65.  
Repairs: Alternator, new brakes on the front, replaced the radiator, broken motor mount, moon roof jams, Power seat belts do not work, fabric on moon roof cover fell off. Thetas all after all those hard driven miles. I bought an extended warranty on the car for $1000 at the time of purchase.  Saturn offered to refund the money if I did not use the warranty. I got my money back. Easy buying form Saturn and much preferred to all the dealing at other dealerships, I have bought new cars from Ford and Nissan. Saturn was the best.
