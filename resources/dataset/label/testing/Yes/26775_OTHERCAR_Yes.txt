            A long time ago someone asked me which was a better car. When I was looking in 1994 for a SUV the choice seemed to boil down to the Jeep or Toyota 4 Runner.  I answered neither. They both are trucks, and the Jeep was a better truck.  It had a better four wheel drive system, it had more horsepower per pound, it cost lots less. The Toyota had more room in the rear, and has fewer defects, but the Jeep simply does things the Toyota can't.  For one the Toyota did not offer a full time four wheel drive system that I knew even my wife could operate. So what is a Jeep anyway?

I call it a passenger truck.  Why? This vehicle is basically a modified pickup that AMC designed in the early 1980s, with a few very nice improvements by Chrysler.  And as I read through other's reviews, I can't help but wonder WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS WITHOUT FOUR WHEEL DRIVE and complain that it is bad on snow? DUH! Without 4-wheel drive this truck is a rear wheel drive Dude with no weight in the rear and why would anyone buy the supid tiny 4 CYLENDER engine? Why did Chrysler even offer it?

Anyway this is NOT a car.  If you want a station wagon go elsewhere.  This is a truck.  It was built on a small pickup frame (Jeep Comanche) and has lots of pickup atributes still.  Its also a 20 year old design. 

So you get: a square dash and headlights, a hard ride, no real cupholders, narrow seats, squeeks and rattles, highway noise, loose steering.

You also get: A powerful engine that gets good gas mileage compared to other trucks of similar power and towing capacity; A hard suspension system designed for off road and heavy loads; Very high ground clearance; The best full time 4- wheel drive system available today (The simple and reliable "Select-trac" is better than the new "Quadratrac" system Jeep is offering on the Grand Cherokeee -- fewer electronics);  The ability to Tow a 5,000lb boat out of the water on a sandy beach;  a luggage rack that can carry the stuff you can't fit inside;  a support system that beats all other SUV makes..... aftermarket accessories made for Jeep Cherokees are everywhere... made by nearly everyone, including Jeep. Yes you can get lights, luggage racks, undercarriage shields, carpets, tire carriers, trailer options, air and adjustable shocks, running boards, covers, steps, luggage boxes, cargo hooks, tow hooks, whatever. You also get a vehicle whose spare parts are reasonable and simple to replace.  

It is what it is: a passenger-truck. I really wish people would stop complaining that this truck doesn't have the characteristics of a car... its not a car. If you want to squeeze three full bodied adults in the rear with a Cadddy plush ride buy a big car or a monster SUV, like the Ford Excursion... if you ride only on the pavement and never see snow, buy one of those. 

If you want to know that you will get where you are going and have to drive in snow, dirt, sand or gravel, if you have only up to two adults and two kids and need to tow something over that snow, dirt and gravel, then get a Jeep Cherokee. For a reasonable price. Leave the luxury home.
