            I love my 1998 Mitsu Eclipse RS.  It's Northstar white, and the car looks extra sporty and clean in white.  I'm in the automotive industry, so I consider myself a bit of an "expert", so read on...

First, the bad news.  With a 2.0L 140-horse engine with not a lot of torque, this car pulls from a dead stop only a bit better than your average subcompact.  Especially with the automatic.  Stomp it, and the engine will wind up like a top and scream bloody murder... and you will *probably* out-accelerate most other drivers... who aren't doing the same thing themselves with six cylinders.  Oh, and about that automatic... it's a bit lazy.  Sometimes it takes it a second to "decide" to shift, and when downshifting while stopping, it makes funny buzzing noises and if you decide you want to accelerate during this process, it'll lurch and act as though you tried to break it.  It's a Chrysler-made drivetrain... and it shows in this respect... many Chrysler front-wheel drive cars and vans make these same noises and have similar behavior.  A few gripes can be made about rattles and squeaks in the chassis when going over bumps... I installed a front strut tower brace and this quelled many of these problems, so this leads me to believe it comes from excessive strut tower flex.  The sunroof also rattles a lot when it's shut.  It sounds like there's a metal plate rattling around in the roof.  The rear seat is cramped and it doesn't have the most legroom up front (I'm 6'2", and I'm OK in the front, but it's not super roomy), but it's adequate.  Anyone buying this car who doesn't realize this going into it must have never been in a sport coupe, though.  The only problems I've encountered are that the front brakes warped during the first 7000 miles, but they were replaced quickly by the dealer at no cost, and I've had no subsequent trouble... I can't complain much about this as it's a common import sports car malady.  The other problem is an incessant belt squeal that happens any time it rains.  The dealer has done everything humanly possible to cure it (I commend them for the effort), but yet it persists in recurring.  There really is no excuse for this, I think.  And it's highly annoying.  However, it's a lot better than the 98 Pontiac Firebird I had before it (for only 6 months) that went to the dealer every other week for some system failure or another!

Positives?  Wonderful handling and great top-end performance.  The 140 horses occur high in the revs, so you'll find once you get going (after that Mustang GT passes you) you'll accelerate more quickly (maybe passing the pony car).  The handling is really great, especially for a front-wheel driver.  It feels balanced and doesn't pitch too much, unless you really push it.  Even on the smallish 14" alloys on the RS, the tires won't come unglued in curves unless you really start pushing it, when the inside tire will start to break loose in typical FWD fare.  The steering gives nice feedback and isn't over-assisted.  I own a Nissan Z-car and this vehicle actually handles nearly as well.  The trunk is also surprisingly useful and deep.  Lifting your load over the high rear deck may be difficult, but the trunk will swallow several suitcases with no problems.  Flip down the rear seatback, and you can stuff in a fake Christmas tree or two bikes with their front wheels removed and stacked on top of them with no problem.  Many sedans have trouble matching that kind of utility.  Note: The GSX all-wheel drive model isn't as big in the trunk.  The factory stereo is quite good, even on the RS which doesn't benefit from the Infinity premium system.  The interior is just as sporty to look at as the outside... and after all, when you're driving it's the inside you're looking at.  From the wrap-around dash and door trim panel design to the cockpit style center console and control "stack" and cool automatic gear selector lever, it conveys a sense of speed.  It's a decent price, too, as I got mine for $16500, $3000 less than sticker.  Do-it-yourself routine maintenance is a snap because the oil filter is easy to reach and the transmission pan is unobscured by suspension/engine mounting crossmembers.

If you're looking for a car that's affordable and sporty with superb handling, the Eclipse RS is the ticket.  If you crave breakneck speed, go with the turbocharged GS-T or GSX, or the new for 2000 V-6 GT, all of which will put any (and I mean ANY) other sports car on the road under $35,000 to the test.  
*********************************
3-Year update!!!:
I've had this car three years now, and I'm still LOVING it!

Problems:  Brakes have warped again, but dealer machined them true quickly.  Belt squeal during the rain persisted until I traced the problem to a tiny, TINY leak in the upper radiator hose that was allowing coolant to drip on the belt... replacing the $1.00 hose clamp on it cured the problem.  Engine oiling problem has been detected when car sits for an extended period of time (2 or more days) without being cranked, all the oil runs into the sump and the engine rattles like crazy when you crank it at first until it builds up oil pressure and the oil begins to circulate to the valvetrain.  This only happens if you allow the engine to get a little low on oil, though (too much rev-happy ricky-racer driving blowing oil past the seals, no doubt).  If the oil sump is full or near-full, it won't do it.

Car now has nearly 40k miles on it and has needed no repairs other than the brakes and the belt problem.  This car is great for sport-compact enthusiasts as an alternative to the Honda Civic/Integra.  Lots of performance and styling parts are available, even for the non-turbo engine!  I have added a 5Zigen muffler, Weapon-R dragon intake, strut tower brace, Tenzo-R rear lower suspension brace, and a Blitz front bumper kit like the eclipse in "The Fast and the Furious" (bad movie, cool cars)  Vehicle has more power and handles even better since the upgrades!  I love this car, even with its minor flaws.
