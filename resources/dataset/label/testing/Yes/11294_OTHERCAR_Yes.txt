            After owning several SUV's, I decided it was time to ditch the gas-guzzling, cube-shaped boat for a fun sporty well-handling car with a tad bit of utility. 

The goal? To find a sporty wagon with 30 mpg or better for under $20k, preferably of Japanese or German descent. 

The contenders: 

Mazda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW and Audi (both BMW and Audi crossed off the list early as even a decent mileage used one was over the budget). Oh, and why not consider Saturn as well. 

The Mazda Protege5 and Toyota Matrix seem like the most fierce competetors of the bunch as the Subaru WRX is priced higher. However, to satisfy curiosity, I test drove the WRX since I had read how hot it was. Not knowing much about Subaru's reliability and quality, I decided against it quickly, even though it was the fastest of the bunch. But for the extra money, I decided I didn't need the extra horsepower. The PR5 has a host of aftermarket options available to it should I decide to up the horsepower. I also dismissed the Saturn as it just didn't have the sport stance I was looking for. 

This left the main contender: Toyota Matrix. I gave the Mazda the styling nod as the Toyota was a bit too over the top styling wise for my taste. Both have a target market of 19-25 yo males and I am a 36 yo mother of a 3 month old. However, after selling my beloved Miata upon the decision to start a family, I decided that the PR5 was just the ticket. 

The Protege5 has just enough room for mom and baby with stroller and toys, enough get up and go to make it to the day care center on time and all while not making me feel like an over the hill soccer mom in a mini-van/SUV. It reminds me of my Miata big time and puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. The vivid yellow color ensures our safety too as no one can say they didn't see us coming! 

This wagon is also about value. I purchased mine with 10k miles on it for $13,990. It was supposedly a Mazda employee car that had only been on the road for 6 months, leaving 2 1/2 yrs and 40k miles on the bumper to bumper warranty. Had I purchased a new one, it would have had a 4 year/50k warranty which is 1 year longer than most new cars. They were asking $18-19k for a new one, so I figured this one was as close to new (still smells it) as possible for $4-5k less. 

The verdict?  A refreshing change from the humdrum SUV world. I can take those 270 degree freeway onramps as fast as my old Miata. And in a $2.30/gallon state, I am much happier at the gas pump as well.
