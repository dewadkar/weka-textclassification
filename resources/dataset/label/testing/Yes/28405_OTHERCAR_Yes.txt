            Spotting the car:

Hello

When I was reading gjacks's opinion about the 1998 Nissan Maxima, it made me think. Do I really want a BMW for more with less options, rear wheel drive, high maintenance. This however will not change my mind regarding the BMWs. They are still one of the finest automobiles on the roads today.
You know, they say: If you ask for the price, you probably can't afford it. See I am one of those people who would ask for the price, even if I can afford it.


Deciding on the deal:

We might just settle with the Nissan Maxima instead of a BMW 325i for now. I was looking at prices and ofcourse mileage on Maximas when I found one at a remote, Ford! dealership about 30 minutes drive from the city where we live right now. The car is a Nissan Maxima GXE with Automatic transmission. I have decided to take a look at this car last night after work. I called the dealership and ask them how late they are open. 9:00 PM is the closing time. Prefect!


Firs impression:

I headed out of town after work last night. It was about a 25 minute drive in some traffic. When I got there the sales people greeted me like if I was one of their relatives. They were all full of smile and positive attitude. 
I spotted the light champagne color Maxima lined up with other imports on this tiny Ford dealership. I quickly discovered that the car was painted. Not the entire body. Only the front bumper and the right front fender. No big deal. The car was not in an accident and it was a leased car buy back. I asked for the key. Opened the hood. The quarter panel was not replaced. Not even the screws removed, ever. This did not bother me but it's a good negotiating key when it comes to numbers. 


The deal:

The price tag was stated at $17,900- on this 59,000 Kms (Around 40000 miles) automobile. The sales man showed me the yellow cardboard piece of paper with the price on it. This used to hang on the rear view mirror. I showed him the printout of their advertisement on the Internet and news paper for $17,500- plus the car is painted. I just had to keep repeating that like an old broken record player.
Ok let's leave the numbers to the end, plus I said enough of them here.


Test drive:

We toke the car for a test drive. One of the sales guys came along with me. Curvy country road. The car was at 120 before I realized, I had to brake to slow down. I was in for a big surprise. I was expecting a mushy, Cadillac like suspension. Instead it was stiff and firm. For a minute I thought I was driving a Honda Prelude or some. The car had plenty of pep and it handled great. The engine was quiet and smooth. The transmission was also very smooth. I had no idea which gear we are in because I could not feel it when shifted up or down. The only shifting I felt is when we were driving up hill and I stepped on the gas a little harder. 
The car responded quickly and accurately. It felt like if this cars was reading my mind and knew exactly which gear I wanted to be in. The whole thing felt like a big sports car and the only thing that reminded me that I am in a 4 door family sedan was the two rear doors when I got out of the car.


Interior and options:

Keep in mind that this is a GXE model Maxima. Not an SE or GLE. The car has no leather seats or moonroof nor alloy wheels. These are options I can live without. They would be nice to have so the car looks nicer but it all depends on the price. After all we are still talking about a used car.
Despite the fact that this is the "low" end Maxima, it really surprised me how many options it has. Even things you normally don't find on more expensive cars. Some of the options that impressed me beside power everything: Power seats, heated seats, heated mirrors, automatic climate control, ABS brakes, CD player, and last but not least the little hole behind the rear arm-rest for skis, etc. The stereo had a 6 speaker layout. Two speakers at the back. Quiet big speakers. Two more speakers in the front doors and also in the front doors two tweeters. I still have to experiment with the stereo on this. Engine: 3.0 Liter V-6 24-Valve quad over-head cam. 190-Bhp, Wow!


Conclusion:

I fully recommend this car to a family or for a single person or for a couple for the following reasons. The car is very powerful, very stylish, loaded with nice options and it is very affordable for a big luxury car. If we can make a deal with this dealer on the numbers, including my Corolla as a trade in, than I will be the proud owner of this beautiful automobile. Cons: If you are a short person like 5 foot or less, I don't recommend this car for you for safety reasons. You will not be able to see backwards when you're in reverse and almost impossible to see out to the right, rear corner of the car. If you are tall. Like 6 foot or taller, also design flaws. The roof is so low that if you are a very tall person, your head will probably touches the roof. I am less than 6 foot and the roof was about an inch or two from the top of my head. Otherwise there is plenty of room in this car for five adults. Lots of leg room and a huge trunk which opens from the driver door release. I also found this feature very handy. This car is probably the nicest loaded import car you can get for under $20,000- these days. Regards.
