            I have a 1994 Camaro and am most likely getting a 2000 Camaro because it might be the last of its kind, which is very depressing to me.  I think the Camaro is better than the Ford Mustang because they are easier to work on, usually faster and I like the body better.  There are some things I would change about the Camaro like more than one-cup holder, roomier back seats, and a few other minor things. So I think if you like a sporty car get the last of its kind. This vehicle, I believe, is one of the finest because it accelerates quickly and drives very smoothly.  My Camaro is a standard and I find that standards tend to be faster and save more gas.  I think that those who are not interested in sports cars should not buy this car, but if you are interested in fast cars and want a car that looks good, this is the car for you. Although it is pretty close to the ground, like most sports cars, that seems to be the only drawback about the actual body of the car.  It does require some keeping up, but if you keep up with the small details of the car, it really does pay off.  It is a very dependable vehicle and I highly recommend buying it before it's too late., <br><br>
