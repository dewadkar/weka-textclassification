            You can forget F ound O n R oadside D ead.  Ford Trucks are the only
way to go.  The Eddie Bauer Expedition is probably my favorite of all
the vehicles we have ever owned.   With my husband, that is a lot!

We have a 1998 EB Expedition.  It is the most comfortable, easy to drive, and packed with features vehicle.  The switch on the fly 4 wheel option is wonderful.  The CD/Stereo is incredible.  They have thought of every
comfort you could want and then some!!

I was so upset when we got this, I called it a school bus, after 2 weeks driving it, I fell in love.  I don't think I could go back to a car or minivan after this.  It maneuvers well, handles great.  As long as you remember that when in 2 wheel drive, IT IS REAR WHEEL DRIVE.  That's important because most of the vehicles on the road today, in my experience, are front wheel drive.  I am so used to that that it took me a while to get used to rear wheel again.  The four wheel drive is available at a split second with the turn of a dial, so for me it has been great.  Especially in the snow.

My husband has been driving Ford Pick Ups since he was 17 years old.  He has ALWAYS had one in the driveway, so It was a natural to go into an expedition.

From the ease of getting in the truck (with lighted running boards).  To the driver switch to open the far rear windows it's in there.  There is so much room and the great flip over and up seat so Adults can get into the farthest back seat with ease.  WE LOVE IT<br><br>
