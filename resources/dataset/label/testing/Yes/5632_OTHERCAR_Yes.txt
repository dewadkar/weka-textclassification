            We have had our vibe for a month now, and have had the opportunity to log a thousand miles in it.  I did the research on the vehicle before purchasing it, and most people liked it, with a few disliking the "Engine Noise" and lack of "pep" in the 130HP 1.8L Motor.  I guess your judgement lies in what you are looking for.  
We needed a vehicle with good gas mileage, a reliable motor, and some room to carry luggage for three.  This vehicle fit the bill.  It is a joint venture between Toyota and GM, with the tried 130hp Corolla motor as standard. Can't get much more reliable than a Toyota Engine.  It also comes standard with Fog Lights and Roof rack, two things missing on the Toyota Matrix.  Simply Put- more for the money. 
The Engine is more than peppy enough to get the job done,be it in-town transportation or highway travel (Cruising at 70-80 MPH is no chore, even loaded down,) even though it is an Automatic (I wanted a Manual transmission, but the salesman said they are few and far between because fewer buyers can drive them, much less buy them.  Sad.)  Our last car was a 1994 Dodge Shadow 2.2L that put out a whopping 93bhp.  At 130bhp, this thing feels like a hot rod. When I put my foot to the floor for quick acceleration, it doesn't sputter and lag, the motor kicks right in.  This in comparison to the 2004 Ford Taurus Wagon we had as a rental vehicle while we were looking for this car.  It did sputter when trying to accelerate quickly. 
The seats are leaps and bounds more comfortable than our previous vehicles, and I like the way the entire cockpit is laid out. I am 6'1" and am always comfortable while driving.  

I have had a few paint chips come out, though, and this is rather disappointing and the only place I would like to see some improvement.  I simply cannot believe that within 1000 miles of ownership, I needed to use touch up paint already. It would also be nice if the rear cargo cover came as a solid plastic (stiff) unit, not as a flimsy piece of rollable plastic.  It isn't the easiest item to manuever when putting it in and taking it out to load large items. Something like the cargo area cover in the PT Cruiser would be nice.   

Essentially, this vehicle is good value for money.  If you are looking for a speedster, get a RX-8.  However, if you want reliable transportation with some cargo room, this vehicle will do just fine. Don't be put off by the naysayers, take one out for yourself and decide. If you are worried about the residual value, look at the Matrix.  Same vehicle, but with less "bells and whistles" as standard.
