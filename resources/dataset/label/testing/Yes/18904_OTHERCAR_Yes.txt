            i wanted a jeep grand cherokee from the first time i saw an ad for them.  the jeep i purchased was a pre-leased vehicle and that brought the price down to almost half the cost of a new vehicle though it was less than one year old.  it is a very comfortable vehicle to drive and extremely efficient on gas.  two weeks after i bought my jeep i drove it over 1700 miles and spent only $40 for gas.  during the ice storms in our area last year i never experienced one bit of trouble driving or stopping.  i was able to drive at the normal speed limit though the roads were covered with it.  i would recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
