                 Why the Viper? Simply because it is almost an affront to the entire automotive industry. While the rest of the pack was loading their vehicles with automatic everything, the Viper has stuck with manually-adjustable almost everything. It was almost revolutionary when Dodge replaced the plastic side curtains with power windows two years ago.In fact, with 450 horsepower at 5,200 RPM and 490 ft-lb. of torque at 3,700 RPM there is enough power for a truck. Literally, as the standard V10 engine in the Viper is based on the same motor used in Dodge's most heavy-duty trucks. The Viper's mission, though, is to provide amazing performance in an almost-race-car package. . Getting to 60 takes no time - 4.9 seconds as tested - and reckless driving ticket speeds are available in second gear. There is a six-speed manual transmission. The Viper is truly a first-rate someday car. <br><br>
