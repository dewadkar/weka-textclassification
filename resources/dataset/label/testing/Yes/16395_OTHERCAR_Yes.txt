                 I own a 1991 Geo Storm GSi.  To start, this is the third car that I have owned.  I bought it for $600.  I was in a hurry when buying this car because my previous car broke down and I needed a car fast for getting to school, work, and just about everywhere else.  I went car searching right after I found out that my previous car's engine was junk.  I searched for about 2 weeks and started getting very impatient.  I always hated Geo before I bought the Storm, because of the name.  When I first saw this car in person my thoughts changed.  I guess they changed at first because of the looks in general.  I saw a red, sporty car with a body that was not too bad at all for the price ($600).  I then test drove it and found that the car had a little power to it also.  So I made the decision to buy the car.  I would have to say that I am still very satisfied with my choice.
     The GSi model is a 2 door/4 passenger car, manufactured by Isuzu Motors, Ltd., and imported by General Motors Corp.  It has an inline 4, with a cast iron block, and a cast aluminum head.  The engine is a 1.6 Liter, DOHC, 16 Valve, with Multi-point EFI (Electronic Fuel Injection).  It comes with 130 HP and 102 lb/ft of torque stock, which is not bad for a Geo.  What I love the most about this car is the body style, the engine, and the front seat room.  I can modify the engine if I choose, or I can leave it alone and still get a fast little car out of it.  There is not much back seat room though.  Fitting 3 other passengers in the car and driving around is almost pushing it.  I love driving this car because it handles good on almost any road because of the ground clearance (5.2 inches off of the ground), and the tires (205/50/R15).  It handles curves and hills great.  
     I think that people who don't mind working on or restoring little sport cars should buy this car.  There are a lot of different modifications that one could do to the engine, thus greatly increasing horsepower, torque, and overall performance.  This car should not be bought with over 200,000 miles by people who want practical, everyday and inexpensive cars, because after the car has this many miles it starts to really become a nickel and dime car.        <br><br>
