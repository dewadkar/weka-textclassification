            With the introduction of the new 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe many car companies were stunned with its new controlled handling and new comforts on the inside. Not only does the Tahoe have a new third seat in the back ,which only children could ride in, but it also has bigger breaks, a new suspension and if you owned an old Tahoe or Suburban you would not be able to tell this was the same car. Now the car is expensive but it is well worth it, the car will last as long as you want to have it. The new 2000 Tahoe drives like a car and you should not be afraid of its size. I like how if you want to take your whole family camping you can load up and go. One thing I do not like is it has bad gas mileage. But in the end it is a great car.<br><br>
