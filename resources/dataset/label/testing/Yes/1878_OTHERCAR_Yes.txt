            i drive a 92 Pontiac Gran Am, 16-Valve.I Love This Car. I Drive it almost every day, it's not mine, it's my dad's however in the 2 months i have driven it i have put around 300 miles on the clock. it is a very reliable car, i have had absolutely no problem with it, and neither has my father in his 3 years of driving it. It may not have much power when it starts out, but once it has been running a while the Acceleration really improves and it will go Really fast. i have gotten it up to speeds that my dad would kill me if he found out(around 100-120) it is a great car for almost anyone, it has room for 5 people, and a lot of trunk space. overall a great car<br><br>
