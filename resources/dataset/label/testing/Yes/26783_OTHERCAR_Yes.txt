            As a first time Saturn owner and recent buyer of a Saturn VUE, my experience has been wonderful. In looking for an SUV, I met all of my criteria with the Saturn VUE. The only negative was that the finance person at the dealership got a little pushy on trying to sell us the extended warranty. But overall, the sales experience was very good.

On the inside, my VUE has plenty of interior room and cargo space, <b>comfortable seats</b> (both front and back), a great 6-speaker CD/stereo, and amenities galore (power package). Saturn also did a great job on the layout of the controls etc.

On the outside, my VUE is red. For accessories, my VUE has the liftgate deflector, molded splashguards, roof rack, and grille guard. I normally don't buy many accessories but with the money I was saving, I was able to get a few extras. My co-workers and my boss were all impressed and can't believe I spent so little.  A number of people said they really like the exterior design ... it reminds them of some of the high-end SUVs on the market.

The appearance was also one thing that attracted me in the first place. I did not want a huge expensive SUV but also did not want anything that seemed super small or like a wanna-be SUV. I wanted something that looked cool and yet was modestly priced. After TT&L, I paid just $15.5K (includes $1K down plus $2K trade-in for my old vehicle). I also looked at the Jeep Liberty, but I would have had to pay an extra $5K for the same features. For example, Air Conditioning is standard on the VUE but optional on the Liberty. Things like this swayed my decision to the VUE.

For those of you interested in the 5-speed manual, I know that there is very little information out there about it. Seems like all the emphasis is either on the V6 models or the VTi transmission. So, here is the scoop.

The 5-speed transmission is European built by the same company that makes transmissions for BMWs and Porsches, as well as for Toyota and other companies. The clutch is very forgiving and the shifter works like a charm. The 143-horsepower 4-cylinder engine provides excellent acceleration. I can easily zoom past other cars in traffic when I need to. Combined with the 4-wheel independent suspension and the electric power steering, this baby takes corners like no tomorrow. You won't see any of those truck based SUVs doing this. To me, it feels like I'm really driving something that is a cross between a sports car and an SUV. In short, the VUE is really fun to drive. My wife and I have to take turns on the weekends. Sometimes she drives on the way to a store and then I get to drive back. But, it is all mine to drive during the week when I go to work. heh heh

I also have two kids (a 5 year old boy and a 3 year old girl) in child seats in the backseat. They can get into and out of the VUE easier than they can in our Dodge Caravan. Yet the VUE has much more ground clearance than our Caravan. The kids also seem to have more room between them in the VUE. In the Caravan, we don't want to banish the kids to the far backseat, so we have them both sit in the slightly shortened middle seat, which kind of crams their car seats together. On the VUE, the backseat is full size and the kids seem to be better behaved, probably because there is some space between them.

Safety was another factor. There are other SUVs out there but not many seem to have as many safety features as the VUE.

Overall, for both practicality and for fun, the VUE is the best deal out there. Best decision I've made this year.
