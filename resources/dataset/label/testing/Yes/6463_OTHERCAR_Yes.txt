            I bought my Camry in January of 1998, and got what I felt to be a great price (below the book).  Everyone comments on how quiet and smooth the ride typically is.  As far as reliability, I feel that it is above average, but not perfect.  I would not recommend that you neglect to do the scheduled maintenance.  I will let you judge for yourself on its record.  

I purchased the car in January of 1998, with 43,000 miles and drove trouble free until October 1999, where at 83,000, the timing belt broke.  I also had to have the tensioner idler replaced because it had been rattling and went bad.  Granted, they say to replace the timing belt at 60,000, I was not expecting to have it go so soon, my previous car had it replaced at 90,000, and it had no wear on it.  In April of 2000, I had to replace the battery.  In August of 2000, The car was running well, but I took a 400 mile road trip, and on the way back, the transmission began to slip and shift terribly.  I took it and had the transmission serviced,like I have done before as recommended, and there were metal shavings in the pan. Oddly enough, I have not had this problem any since that one time.  

I have recently, April 2002, at 127,000 miles had to do a complete tune-up, It wouldn't hardly run.  I didn't think it would be ready for it so soon.  I had previously tuned it up in 1999 at about 70,000 miles. I also, a week later, had to put a new battery in it, the old one died with no warning.

As for the transmission, it seems to be doing okay despite the scare.  I do have it serviced more than the book says just because of the previous problem.  The only thing that is a little off is that when the car is cold, it doesn't want to go into overdrive. 

As far as the suspension, is has squeaked a little more than it seems it should, and I feel I have had to replace the brakes more often than I should have to.  This could, however, be due to the roads around where I live.

Overall, I have had a few problems, but I still feel that Toyota makes good cars, this one included.
