<TEXT>
            I have a 93 Pontiac Grand Am GT. I bought it almost five years ago and I bought it used. It had about 12,000 miles on it so it seemed new.  I have not had to put much money into it but I am at 60,000 miles so there are a few things wrong with it.  I have power windows and the window on my driver side has problems going up and down.  I had it fixed about a year ago and it is broken again.  They said that it was from using it all of these years.  My passenger side window is very slow. There is a hesitation when you push on the gas from a complete stop but once you are going it has good pick up.  It looks very good when it has been washed and vacuumed.  It actually looks newer than it is. It is a low car so I would not recommend it for people who have back problems or problems getting in and out of the car. Also, I have a two door and it is hard getting my son in and out of his car seat.  I would get another one but I would get four doors next time.<br><br>
