            Recently I was in the Market for a Sports Utility vehicle. I test drove many vehicles, but enjoyed the comfort and handling of the Ford explorer the best. The exterior of the vehicle is truly beautiful along with the interior. It seems that ford really listened to the consumer when the revamped the ford explorer sport. The Sport version which I did purchase is truly designed for the active person who leads an active lifestyle with sports and travel. <br><br>
