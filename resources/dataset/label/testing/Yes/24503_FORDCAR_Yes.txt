                 The Ford Bronco is the definition of large sport utility vehicle.  It a big mean looking truck that won't let anything get in its way.  The O.J. Simpson trial may come to mind when you think about this truck but dont let that discourage you it is a great automobil.
     I previously owned a 1992 Bronco XLT 4X4 with a 5.0 litter V8.  Everything on the truck was stock except for the tires, which I upgrades to 32' BFGs, and a flow master exhaust.  The truck hanldes extremely well on the streed and surprisingly has an alright turning radius, but if you can't make the U-turn in the space you are given it is easy to hop up the curb and create a little more room.  The engine was powerful and could help this bad boy climb about any hill that you could find, and it had its fair share of torque also.  
     The interior of this truck is very spacious.  5 full grown adults can very comfortably go along for a ride.  One thing that I paticulauly like was that the back seat was positioned higher than the front seats so everyone in the back had a perfect view of what was going on in front of them.  Another little option that I found very convinient was the automatic roll down back window, since the Bronco is only a two door this can help get a little bit of air to those people riding in the back.  Another neat little trick, that I don't recommend trying is the back portion of the roof is removable to give you that cool sporty look so you can cruize the beaches in style.
     All though there are not that many negatives about this truck there is a couple.  The first is the fact that there are only two doors, I think that it gives this truck a great look but, because of its size it makes it hard for people to climb into the back seat.  This problem can be solved with the addition of a step to the side of the truck.  The other thing is not really a problem with the truck but instead the problem with the city, because of its size it is hard to find a parking spot big enough to fit this beast, this just means that you are going to have to pass up those compact spots, but just know if you were to meet one of these smaller cars in a collision you will drive away the champion.
     If you look enough you can find one of these trucks in great condition for a very low cost, and like Ford says &quot;they are built to last&quot;, so I think that you will be satisfies with your purchase.<br><br>
