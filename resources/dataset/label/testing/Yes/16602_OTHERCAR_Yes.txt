            I have a 1995 3000 gt. automatic,v6,base model. I've made a few changes to the engine and have about 280 hp. as well as looks I've made alot of changes. just basic stuff like tint,stereo system,neons.
 love: the body is one of the best I've ever seen(besides the ferrari).It gets all kinds of attention. I never thought I would have 1. I plan to enter my car in a few car shows and the fact that not many people have this car makes it stand out. it's not your usual junkstang or camaro. this car is unique. unlike honda's in car shows, they have to add body kits to make the car look good, the 3000 gt already comes with it's overwhelming style. the interior is good, but only if your going out for a while. there's no room for any extra stuff and only 1 other person can ride. but when we go to the clubs. everyone in line outside turns thier head to see who is in this awesome car. it handles smoothly, especially on the freeway.compared to the firebird I had before, I love this car. and when I get can't hang mustangs and camaros and honda's pull up to me and want to race, I sometimes wish I would have gotten the vr-4 but I still haven't been beaten in my car. and if something faster pulls up like a cobra or z28........I just kick in the nitro. and my BASE MODEL V6, will tear up those v8 engines.
hate: just the fact that I need new brakes often, and tires.never had any other problems. wish I had a little more room. wish it would have came w/a more powerful engine(stock).
 overall:I love the car, but it's not for everyone. got to love a sportystyle and not be afraid to step on the gas. it's a gas gussler so if you think just because it's a v6 it won't waste much, your wrong. I plan to keep it and pass it down to my kids. as a dj, this car fits my style!!!<br><br>
