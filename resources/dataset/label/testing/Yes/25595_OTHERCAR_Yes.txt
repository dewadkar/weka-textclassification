            This car is fun. How fun? WOW!!!

Saabs are quirky cars. Not quirky bad but quirky like a cult. The damn things run forever. I know people who have Saabs with close to 300,000 miles and they prefer this car to their new Saab.  Maybe they put crack in the steering wheels. I don't know. But what ever they do they do it right. The car becomes a part of you. 

My girlfriend has a 1999 SE convertible and I love it. I've put on more miles than she has (almost). I get jealous when she drives it. The car really likes me, really it does. I must confess though... I just bought a new Land Rover Discovery (see my review if it is an option). Hey, I like to drive off road. 

the bottom line is this car likes to be driven...fast. And it is fast. The best part is it doesn't look fast but when the turbo kicks in watch out. 

The handling is like an old English sports car. It rolls but grips like one of those rubber octopuses that crawl down your window. 

The only drawback is the fact that front wheel drive at high rpms cause you to hold on to the steering wheel with 2 hands. This is also a benefit. It rules in snow and rain. There is a reason why the Aspen police drive Saabs as well as the city employees. It drives EXCELLENT in the snow. It impresses me every time.

Finally, the convertible top is amazingly designed and rear seats have plenty of room (I'm 6' and have no problem sitting back there). The top is quiet, VERY well insulated and when up teh box it fits in can be tied up for extra trunk room. Trunk room is small but it is a convertible and better than most.

In conclusion, the car rules. There are only 2 minor draw backs. One, the service is generally not of the calibur of BMW, Mercedes, Audi, etc. but it rarely has to get services. Second, (which IMHO is a benefit) there are few bells and whistles in the car. It is simple but missing nothing.

Really it is a great car and nothing compares (esp. with no new BMW convertible in the show rooms).<br><br>
