            When I began shopping for cars, I would have laughed at you if you would have told me I was going to buy a Saturn.  I thought all they made were small family cars and nothing sporty.  Boy was I wrong.  I bought the SC2 coupe.  The car is absolutely amazing.  Not only is it economical and safe, it gets great gas mileage.  I just wish I had known about this car earlier.

Safety was one of the most important features on my mind when considering a vehicle, since I will be having my first child in February.  The Saturn is almost unmatched in safety.  And with the third door, putting my child in the seat won't be a hassle.  The insurance costs on this car compared to other cars are unbelievable.  And the car drives like a dream.  

Last but not least, this car is super sporty.  Has everything you would want, including pin stripes and a super cool moonroof.  And of course the bright blue color turns heads all the time.  The car is everything I have ever wanted and I suggest that everyone looking for a vehicle consider a Saturn.  You won't regret it.<br><br>
