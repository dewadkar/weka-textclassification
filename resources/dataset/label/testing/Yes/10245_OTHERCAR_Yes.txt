            I wanted to buy a SUV but feel like driving a car, at the time of the purchase, other SUVs did not seem to satisfy my demands in a car.  The only other car that was a luxury SUV at that time that came close was the Mercedees SUV, However I heard of horrible stories from friends who but one and the car seem plain inside.  So, I decide to purchase a lexus RX 300.   I love the drive and performance,  it had great pick up speed and handling for tight manuvers.  the right was great too!!! quiet, and smooth (very smooth)..  The radio controls and navigation system are excellent and helpful especialy in different cities and towns.   the car's interior is very confortable in the front and rear.  I have also been able to stuff a lot of items when needed such as landscaping projects and moving furniture.  

Besides regular maintence appointments with the car I have had no problems.

The car I bought was fully loaded with every option imaginable.  and the price wa great cheaper then a 4runner.  My mother and mother in law also bought one because they loved my when they drove it.  

it handles pretty well of the road on grass and dirt and gravel never had any problems.

It drives well on snow about six inches too.  although, the brakes can squeak at times but its not a complaint for me.  I love the car!!
