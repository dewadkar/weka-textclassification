            I owned a Subaru Legacy for 10 years before deciding to trade. The search for a new car was narrowed to the Accord and Camry, both were equal in my opinion I just got a good deal on the Accord.

The EX is the model I got, with leather seats, sunroof, and a V6. If you like to wear shorts as I do don't buy leather, your legs stick to it in hot weather. This is my first car with a sunroof and it's nice. My grandson loves it.

Gas mileage is 21 worst and 32 best. I check each tank full and it does vary by octane and brand.

Complaints are minor, the headlights go off when you turn the car off, but a chime let's you know you forgot to turn them off and after a few seconds they go off. Why not just turn them off. There is some wind noise but not that bad.
The a/c vents are hard to get directed where you need them, they are too small and too high I believe.

The dealer I bought from gave us a good trade and has been super to deal with. I sent both my daughters to them and they each bought one.
