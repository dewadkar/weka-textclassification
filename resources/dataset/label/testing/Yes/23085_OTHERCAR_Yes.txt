            I looked at all of the different digital cameras that were being offered at the time.  I did choose this one because of the price.  The other cameras that I was looking at were at least $100.00 more than this one.  I did not know a lot about these cameras so I did not even know what features I wanted.  I am glad that I got this one.  It does everything that I want it to do.  There is a screen on the back of the camera so you can see your pictures.  The pictures come out very clear.  Also, the software that came with it is very useful.  It is very easy to transfer the pictures from the camera to the computer.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for one.  <br><br>
