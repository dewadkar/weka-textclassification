            Whiplash.  That's what happened when I stepped on the gas test driving this car.  I own a Manual 5 speed 94 Saturn SL, and I enjoy how it takes off when you hit the gas.  But it is still quite light and a little uncontrolled.

Then I met my new love; the Saturn LS.

This car was unbelievable.  I liked the look of the car, first of all.  Much more agressive than it looks in pictures.  It stands taller than I expected, which my friend who was with me appreciated.  He's 6'4&quot;.
The interior was very friendly, and I even liked the stereo (I'm extremely hard to please).  The simulated wood paneling was gorgeous and gave the impression of a more expensive sedan.

I will never forget my test drive, mostly because Colorado Springs, Colorado is a great place to put cars to the test.
I mentioned before the feeling of reverse whiplash as we accelerated in the car.  I didn't mention that this was up a 6% grade.
The acceleration was impressive to me because of how smooth it was.  I've been in lots of 'ballsy' cars, but they always seem just on the edge of control and fluctuate throughout the power band.
Not the LS.  Smooth as silk.  Sure, not the fastest car in the world, but they never claim to be.

Now, the other cool part about this test drive was the salesman in the car.  I thought we might take the car for a 'real' test, Highway 115 south of Colorado Springs.  This road has hills, twists and turns that make flatlanders cringe; but it was my daily commute.  I brought it up, and the salesman said, &quot;Why not?  I'm not doing anything this afternoon!&quot;

Though I did not take him up on the 'offer', I felt this spoke greatly of the Saturn philosophy.  The salesman told me in great detail what was different about this car than the S series I am so familiar with (He even told me about the fact that this car uses a teflon/steel reinforced timing belt to make the car run quieter; the S series uses a timing chain (noisy, but reliable).  His comment about not having anything else to do essentialy told me that he was not on commision, that he cared more about me making the right choice than getting a sale.

It's been my goal for some time to own a 2000 Saturn.  Perhaps this will be the one...<br><br>
