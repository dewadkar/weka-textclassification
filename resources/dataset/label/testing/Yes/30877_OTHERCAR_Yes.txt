            This vehicle was purchased to replace my wife's Audi A4 Quattro.  We were actually looking at 1999 and up Jettas, but they just didn't feel like the best solution.  We spotted an Element at a dealership and my wife fell in love instantly.  As soon as I mentioned that I'd consider buying one she nearly yanked the wheel to get us into the dealership.  It was pretty much over from there.

My first impression when looking at the Element is that it looked very practical.  The doors on each side opened up a full 90 degrees to offer full access to the sides, and the clamshell rear doors made access just as easy in the back.  The floor was rubber and the car had nearly a cavernous aura about it.  We took some flyers home to talk it over but I walked away with a good impression.

The next morning I started noticing just how funky the darn car looks.  The title "plastic lunchbox on wheels" instantly popped into my head and I've been unable to forget it weeks later.  I really wasn't sold on the looks but my wife loved it, and ultimately since it would not be my everyday car, form ruled over fashion.

We bought the car and in less than a week put over 1000 miles on it.  I immediately noticed that the gas gauge seemed to drop at a rather fast rate.  Once I started monitoring mileage I realized the gas guzzling was an illusion created by the gas gauge.  At every fill-up I've calculated over 23mpg and I do not always have a light foot.  My only gripe is that the gas light comes on when there is nearly 5 gallons of gas left.  When the gauge shows a little below 1/4 tank, I can only squeeze 11 gallons into the car.  I ran the car rather close to E at one point and could only put in 11.8 gallons.

Driving the car is rather pleasant.  It is missing the manly gene that I normally had with my sports car (or that you'd find with a larger vehicle) which bugs me at times but I tend to phase it out for the most part.  It is comfortable for long trips and for the most part the drive is car-like (but nowhere near my A4 with the sport package).  I should also complain about the stock driver's armrest.  It is just too small.  I highly recommend the upgrade.  The stereo (top of the line EX unit with subwoofer) sounds great and makes trips fun.  The car has a terrific turning radius that makes parking or turning feel great.  

The feel of the car is very solid.  The room for back occupants is remarkable, and people love the "stadium seating" feel that allows them to see the road from the back.  The power of the engine is great down low, but it has nearly no high-end power.  It has just enough power to pass slower traffic but that's about it. It also is a little loud for my taste, but it is the typical Honda 4-cylinder and technically it's not a big issue.  I should mention that I'm not happy with the stock headlight system.  It does not shine far enough ahead for highway driving in my opinion.  I am definately going to purchase fog lights for it, and will also likely invest in an aftermarket replacement for the headlight bulbs. 

The storage area in the rear is terrific.  I picked up 4.3 cubic foot stand-up freezer and was able to slide it in the back without an issue by folding the rear seats up to the side.  For options, I think the minimum required (for an EX model) is the security system, splash guards, drivers side armrest upgrade, and the cargo net for the back (for groceries).  The other option that I purchased was the keyless entry.  I agree that the options are expensive, but shop around to different dealers.  My dealer installed each option at dealer cost plus labor, saving me about $300.  They also knocked off nearly $1,000 of MSRP on the vehicle itself.

Overall the car is great.  Extremely practical, relaxing/easy to drive and great for hiking/camping or anything that would get an interior dirty.  I would recommend it to anyone that either likes or can look beyond the looks and wants a reliable and VERY practical automobile.
