            I bought a 93 Honda Prelude SI in January of 1999. It was my 5th of 6 cars, and it was my 3rd Honda. I will admit up front that my opinion on this car is going to be somewhat tainted by my previous experiences with Honda's, which were better. I owned this car for about a year and a half.

The car I owned prior to this Prelude was a 1990 Honda Accord EX Coupe. The first thing I noticed about the Prelude when I started driving it is its horribly designed and poorly laid-out interior. The ergonomics on this car are terrible. The window/door lock buttons are way up and forward in the door panel, and are difficult to locate without looking directly at them. Most of the switches and buttons on the other panels suffer the same sort of misplacement. Their only saving grace is that they are large and well illustrated. Then there is a panel to the right of the main instrument cluster that houses your gas gauge, temp gauge, and all the normal warning lights (low fuel, oil pressure, check engine, etc etc). The gas and temp gauges are actually an illuminated LED display, rather than a typical analog gauge. Most people find this attractive, but I never thought of it as anything more than a cheap gimmick. And what's with placing them over to the right like that? Apparently the designers of this car thought that the passenger should have full view of these gauges as well. 

The seats were comfortable, if not a bit low, and the back seat had a decent amount of space for a sport coupe. Interior lighting is poor in this car, and storage space is even more of a joke. The glove compartment has the storage capacity of a standard envelope (no exaggeration) and there isn't really any cubby holes elsewhere with the exception of the inside door pockets. Also, what's up with the lack of cup holders (there are none)? This is where I really started to miss my Accord. The one thing I did like about the interior in this car over my Accord is that the center console is angled toward the back seat, making the radio and climate control more easily reached by the driver. As usual with any Honda, the climate control system is very easy to understand and operate even without looking at the controls. One of the most annoying aspects of the interior is the amount of road noise you experience at highway speeds.

Now I realize that this car is a sports car, and therefore not likely to have a large number of interior conveniences. However all of the 7 cars I have owned in my life have been sport coupes. I do not make the complaints about the Prelude's interior by comparing it to all cars, but rather to my experience with other sport coupes. In other words, in my opinion the interior of the Prelude is poorly laid out and designed compared with other sport coupes, even taking into account the fact that most cars of this sort typically don't have a large number of interior amenities. I'm not trying to compare this car to a minivan or a station-wagon. 

There were a number of odd problems with this car. The clutch always seemed really touchy. The defogger never really did a good job, even with the AC on as Honda recommends. The blower on the climate control was never very strong. My right rear taillight would burn out every few months. As with any Honda, it was a very reliable car otherwise. 

Performance wise, it was a decent car, but not enough to justify its lack of interior amenities and conveniences. I improved the handling of this car a great deal by replacing the stock 195/55-15 tires with 205/50-15. The power is adequate, but nothing special. Of course the VTEC has a bit more power.
