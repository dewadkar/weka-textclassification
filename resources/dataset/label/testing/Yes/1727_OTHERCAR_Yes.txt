            I bought my very first car in April 2002, a 5 speed 1997 Honda Del Sol Si (the "Civic" was removed from the name and the physical car after 1995).  It had 77,000 miles on it when I purchased it but I didn't bat an eye because it's a Honda and I am entirely confident that it will run almost forever with few problems.

There are few bad things to say about this car.  The rear windshield rolls down which is fantastic in winter because the heat, even on the lowest setting, is extremely hot.  The roof is easy to remove by one person and, at 40 pounds, isn't heavy at all.  It locks in to place in a special holder in the trunk which also has a latch so you can open it (just like the trunk lid) so that it doesn't take up any room and you can still put things in the trunk when the roof is in there.  The trunk itself, while not huge by today's standards, is a bit of a surprise considering the size of the car.  At 10 cubic feet, I have never found myself needing more space.  It is a very comfortable ride and there is plenty of leg room.  There are several locking compartments inside the car to store various small items, which is useful because the glove box isn't.  The only real complaint I have is that the cupholder is nearly impossible to operate (especially with one hand) and is probably more difficult to operate than the roof.  I have noticed that the roof tends to squeak a little in cold weather.  There is also a bit of road noise that I have only noticed in winter and I'm not sure why, but it's not loud enough to be bothered by.

The Si has 127 horsepower, compared to the S's 105 and the VTEC's 150.  The Si does have a VTEC engine, but it is SOHC compared with the DOHC of the actual VTEC.  While I initially wanted a VTEC, I couldn't find one and settled, but I wouldn't call it settling any more.  The Si is quick enough for me- the shifting is smooth (though the clutch is pretty soft) and the power is there when you need it.  The VTEC kicks in at about 5000 RPM so you don't really notice it unless you drive the car pretty hard, but it's worth it every once in a while.

This car is, in a word, tiny.  It weighs slightly less than a ton and is very short.  At night this makes for a few uncomfortable moments when the headlights of cars behind reflect off of the side mirrors.  But it makes for a smooth ride and makes the car feel very solid and stable.

After 1995, Honda also removed the fog lights from the Del Sol.  They do look rather nice on the older models and would be kind of nice to have, but it's probably better to have a car that's 4 years younger anyway.  

All in all, the Del Sol is a wonderful vehicle and a great value, both in price or gas mileage.  Some would say it's a "girl's car," and all I can tell you is that this girl loves hers!
