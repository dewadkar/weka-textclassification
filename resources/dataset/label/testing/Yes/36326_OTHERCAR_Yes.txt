            The 2002 Z28 has to be the one of the best sports cars for the year. The 5.7L 310HP V8 with the 6 speed manual transmission gets you 0-60 in about 5.3 seconds and only requires you to shift into 2nd. (Speaking from personal experience.) The biggest turnoff of the manual transmission option is a very annoying 1st to 4th computer assisted shift. What that does is FORCE you to shift into 4th gear during certain conditions. (Usually a moderate acceleration where you don't shift into second before you hit 15mph.)

The outer appearance is solidified with the Sport appearance package. It adds ground body moldings, front facia extension, and rear spoiler extension. The optional T-Tops is a nice add on for those of us that don't like convertibles but like a little bit of "open air". The trunk storage area for the removable roof panels will also allow for you to lock them in. So your tops can either be locked in place or in the storage area. The leather seating option lets you just sink right in. One comment I heard from a passenger required me staying the night so "I can sleep in your car". The rear bucket seats are a little bit too upright to get really comfortable in but then again there isn't enough leg room back there for anyone but maybe a 10 year old.
