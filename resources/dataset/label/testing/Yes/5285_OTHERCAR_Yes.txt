            My wife and I recently bought a 1999 Honda Accord EX with the sunroof and the four cylinder.  I would recommend this car to anyone who would like a reliable, well built car.  Previous to this car we owned a Chevy Monte Carlo Z-34, and I would have to say this car beats it hands down.  

The Monte Carlo had a sporty 6 cylinder engine which could accelerate fast, but to tell you the truth it handled very poorly on ice and snow.  It had a long wheel base with powerful front end acceleration, and all this meant in the winter was headaches.  The accord, however, has a shorter wheel base and more responsive steering.  We have had no problems with it on either snow or ice, and the honda 4 cylinder is powerful enough that you wont miss a 6 cyl.  Finally, the comfort level in the Accord is very high.  In the Monte Carlo I felt as though I were riding on the ground, and the seats were not comfortable.  In the Camry we also compared, the backseat was more like a piece of plywood with fabric on it, so beware of the passenger comforts of the Toyota.

If you are anticipating buying an Accord, I would highly recommend that you test drive both the 4 and 6 cylinder models.  When you do, think realistically about how much towing you will be doing with your accord, and I think you will agree that the 6 cylinder is an unneeded expense.
