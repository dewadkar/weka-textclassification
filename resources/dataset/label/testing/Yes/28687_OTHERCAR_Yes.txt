            First, I might as well mention that while my car is actually a '89 model, not a '90, there's not much of a difference between the two, and I didn't know where else to put this review. They don't seem to have room for reviews on anything older.

This is a car that I bought for my senior year in college because I needed a very cheap car, with the intention of selling it when I graduated and got a job. Now that it looks like I'll be selling it, this is one car I'll probably miss when it's gone. It's a fun car to drive. The 2.5 Turbo has a lot of pep, although unfortunately at over 100,000 miles the clutch is now shot and has trouble putting its power to the road. Suspension is stiff and rattly but not really a problem on anything except brick roads, and I like the handling it delivers. On the highway, it routinely gets over 30 mpg. This car won't hurt the wallet when it comes to either purchasing it or paying at the pump.

While the car looks like a sporty luxury car, it definitely emphasizes sport more than luxury. Mine is surprisingly devoid of luxury items, lacking even things like power windows and air conditioning. Some reviewers in the automotive press have complained about a "noisy turbo engine". Maybe that's a bad thing if you're expecting a refined luxury car, but I kind of like the whistle of the turbine and the whoosh of the blow-off valve. The suspension is similarly something that emphasizes performance rather than coddling the driver. It's not all that bad when you get it on the highway; I've spent a whole day behind the wheel in it without really feeling particularly uncomfortable. It's not something you should get if you're expecting luxury.

The worst problem I have with it, aside from its lack of air conditioning, is that after 10 years it definitely feels like a beater. Several interior trim bits are broken and the clearcoat is starting to peel. This car looks as cheap as it costs. On the other hand, it's still a car I can trust to get me from point A to point B without trouble, and even have fun doing it.
