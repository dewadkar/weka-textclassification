            <i>Note: 1992 represented the first year for the new Trooper model, the suspension was revised with coil spring rear and torsion bar front, and the body was completely revamped.  This year also featured Isuzu's first V-6 offering, the 3.2L (previous V-6s were GM).  The 1992 Trooper is not much different from the 2001 model as far as mechanicals and configuration.  Also, the Epinions photograph of the 1992 Trooper is actually a 1991 Trooper.</i> 

 <b>How I ended up with this thing!</b>  I purchased my 1992 Trooper LS from a friend.  His wife wanted a new Rodeo, I needed more space than my pick-up offered because of our new baby, so it was a good match up.  I've always owned four wheel drive vehicles, and the Trooper's utilitarian style attracted me.  I soon learned that the Trooper is a no-kidding four wheel drive truck that does a great job hauling around the family wares, and then taking me to my fishing hole.

  <b>Ready for safari.</b>  The Trooper has full under truck shielding.  It has shields over the oil pan, front differential, transmission, transfer case and gas tank.  The Trooper features 4.55:1 ratio differentials for plenty of torque and power to move about off-road.  The 190hp DOHC V-6 is a little fancy for this kind of vehicle, but it is very competent, and paired with the gearing, it moves the 4200 lb machine with no straining.  It also offers ample power for freeway on-ramps and highway cruising.  And speaking of cruising, the Trooper has a very nice on-road ride, nice enough to invite the grandparents along and not scare the be-jesus out of them.  Just in case you do scare 'em, there are handles galore, this truck has a handle grip just about anywhere you can grab, and it even has foot rests for the rear seat passengers, they are under the driver's and passenger's seats.  The four wheel drive system in my truck is the standard 4 lo/hi 2 hi setup, with no fancy torque drive or power on demand.  I like it simple, even though many auto writers poo poo the antiquated nature of this system.  Don't let the upscale amenities of the LS fool you, the Trooper is all truck underneath.  There is enough truck under a Trooper that I'm sure many people don't like it because it seems too &quot;trucklike&quot;.
  
  <b>Older than dirt.</b>  By the way, my Trooper is old, over eight years old.  It has well over 100,000 miles on it, and it seems very tight and durable.  My neighbor owns a Rodeo with many fewer miles on it, and it's seen lots of mechanical trouble.  The build of the Trooper seems much stouter than the Rodeo.  <b>Alibis:</b>  I did have the timing belt tensioner replaced, and the transmission serviced, and it was fairly expensive.  To service the tranny, you have to remove the exhaust and the skid plate that protects it, somewhat time consuming.  Watch your mechanic wring his hands over that one as you write the fat check! 
 
  <b>Cheap goodness.</b>  Troopers can be had for very good bargains.  They are not nearly as popular as Four Runners, but they are a good competitor.  They definitely outclass the Toyota in cargo area.  They won't beat a V-8 sport ute in a race, that is if it's on flat pavement.  I would match my Trooper against anything up a sandy hill face.  If you want a truck and not some fancy station wagon, the Trooper will do nicely.  If you are never going to go off-road, there are probably other sport utilities out there that will treat you just a little bit nicer (but you're not going to get the automatic fold in mirrors!).
  
  <b>Forget them yuppie-mobiles!</b>  Consider a Trooper if you don't care about making a statement, want a competent off road vehicle, and you desire a lot of hauling capacity and flexibility.  They are a viable alternative to the Vehicles on the market that lack both Sport and Utility.

<i>Update: August 13, 2000, for those wondering about gas mileage, my Trooper (with 104,000 miles clocked) got 15.5 MPG @ 80 MPH with the AC running during a road trip over the weekend.  Not stellar, but not too bad, either.  I had a fullsized Ford Bronco once that got 11 MPG.  I think the Troop would get better fuel economy @ 65 or 70 MPH.</i>
