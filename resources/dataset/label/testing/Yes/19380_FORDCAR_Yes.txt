            I stand by my '91 Thunderbird!  It has 202,500 miles on it and I've had no major repairs.  Ever!  I had the front and rear brakes replaced once, and the tires replaced once.  Not bad for a 10 year old car.  The air conditioning no longer works, and sometimes the driver's side window is slow in cold weather, but these are minor problems considering I only paid $5000 for it almost 6 years ago.   
As some of the other reveiwers noted, it is bad in the snow.  The back-end fishtails if you give it too much gas.  And the black trim paint above the rear window has begun to peel, but that if easily fixed.  In fact I am going to peel off the remaining peels and paint it next week.  The paint on the body of the car looks great, it is still bright and shiny.  No one ever believes my car is as old or well-travelled as it is.
My family has purchased its share of thunderbirds and we all feel the same way.  We've all had the same minor problems, but feel it is well worth it for such a reliable car.  I am not letting this baby go! She'll be with me 'til her dying day, (which may very well be after 300,000 miles.)
