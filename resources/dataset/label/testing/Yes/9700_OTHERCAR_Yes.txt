            My family received this car as a loaner from the dealership while our QX4 was getting worked on. As soon as I got in the car I was quite impressed with the leather interior, and the nice placement of all the interior buttons. Though once I pulled the car out of the driveway I noticed the cars value decline in my head. I am glad my parents did not buy this car. They were lucky enough to only get it as a loaner.

I have a 98 acura integra of my own and its much less expensive($5000) with this in mind, my integra was more solid and more powerful the 2001 Infiniti G20. The car handled extremely well in turns, though on the straight paths the car was so weak I believe I saw a honda civic pass me. This was a complete embarrassment. The did not hold up to my expectations with its low power. Even though the interior was incomparable to any I have seen lately.

The interior was layered in leather, which was a nice touch and had a perfect driving position inside. The thermometer(ac and heater) were easy to use and access. The stereo was equipped, with a Bose 6 speaker system that was &quot;bumping.&quot; The seats were partially powered with tilt forwards and backwards. Though the up and down were hand powered, that disappointed me with everything else being so convenient. Another disappointment with the inside was the car alarm that only had main door keyless entry when you pushed the unlock button. Possibly it could be configured for all doors though for only the main door pushing the button was a hassle every time.

The car overall would be perfect for older women who want to relive their youth or show off to their friends a sports car they purchased. As it looks young and fresh, with its new design, though the power would be perfect for them as it will never go too fast.<br><br>
