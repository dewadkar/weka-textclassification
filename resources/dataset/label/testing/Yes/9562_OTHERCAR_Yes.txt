            At almost the exact moment I was reflecting on the demise of the pocket rockets, a bright blue 2000 Toyota Celica pulled into my driveway. Kinda looks like the old pocket rockets. Yep. Close enough, I thought! 

But it's not really a pocket rocket. It shares their lack of function, but just look at that bottom line. Almost $20,000 - for the base GT model No cheap thrills here. Plus, it's bigger than the little scooters of old. And this time around, it also competes with the Acura Integra, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mercury Cougar and upscale Honda Prelude. 
 


Gen Y buyers, you're the new target for this car and its outta-this-world styling. So here's the question: Would you rather plunk down $20,000 for the optioned Celica or $14,000 for something like an optioned Ford Focus, which would leave you with $6,000 for aftermarket modifications? In many parts of the world, your counterparts are choosing the latter route. 

I think Toyota has its work cut out with the Celica.
