            In 1997 I purchase a new car for the first time in many years.  After looking at what was available for the price I could pay, I chose a Hyundai Sonata.  After two years, this may be the last car I own for many a year.  It still looks new, has had no maintenance problems, only one set of brake replacements (after nearly 46,000 miles in two years).  

The size is deceptive, there is plenty of room and mucho storage in the trunk.  We have traveled with goods for two small children, (including toys, portable bed, extra everything, adult suitcases, and extra materials to be delivered at our destination) comfortably and without the necessity of filling the inside of the car with bags and boxes because they wouldn't fit in the trunk.

The dealerships are extremely helpful.  One the one year anniversary of purchasing the car, we received a &quot;birthday&quot; card for the car. How many dealerships do you know that remember a customer that long.  This is policy, not just the dealership.

With small ones traveling in the car, we have found the upholstery easy to clean, yet very comfortable.  The exterior paint seems to be relatively chip proof, and after being bumped from behind three times, there is not a mark on the bumper.

It has a feature which allows you to lock the trunk and disable the internal opening switch (so a valet can park the car, but not reach any valuables you may have loced in the trunk).  It also has other extras that my husband and I would only have expected in a luxury car and had to look up in the owners manual (but found this helpful and easy to use).

The only true drawback I have found is there is no warning tone if you leave the car with the lights on.  The battery is small and several times my husband has had to call for a jumpstart because he accidentally left the lights on.

This quiet riding car is great for families, and those who do a lot of traveling.  It is quiet, thrifty on gas, and easy to maintain.  But, a sports car it is not.

When we are ready to trade it in or buy a second new car, you can believe we will go back to Hyundai again and see what they have.  There is little on the negative side to say.

I hope this will help someone else at least consider this excellent car.  We're sure glad we did.<br><br>
