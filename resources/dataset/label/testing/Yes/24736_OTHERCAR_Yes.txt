            I have used several different digital cameras, including Kodak, Fuji, and Yashica. I am a Field Engineer who redesigns systems in the field. It is extremely important to me a camera give a wide range of options. I started using Sony digital cameras three years ago.

I am extremely pleased both with the product and service available worldwide. This camera the DSC-S70 is by far the best and most versatile camera I have used. The ability to choose several ranges of photo sizes is particularly useful. I find the camera easy to use and the detail outstanding.

For my money I do not believe there is a better camera available on the market today. The camera is lightweight and compact. The ability to attach an external flash to defuse the light from the flash is also extremely helpful when photographing shiny objects such as polished steel and chrome. There are other features of this camera that make it an exceptional value.

View screen to view taken photos and the ability to edit them on the spot. It has a viewfinder as well as the view screen for taking the photos and has full macro capabilities.<br><br>
