            Honda�s reputation for world-class engineering was enhanced with the introduction for 1991 of the Acura NSX. The NSX (marketed as an Acura in the U.S.; as a Honda elsewhere) represented an attempt by the Japanese firm to combine exotic car style and performance with Honda style practicality and reliability. In this respect, as in nearly all others, the NSX succeeds brilliantly. Extensive use of aluminum in the structure and suspension holds the weight of the two seat, mid engine coupe to just over 3,000 pounds, allowing the use of an equally mass-efficient aluminum 3 liter V6 engine. The twincam powerplant uses Honda�s VTEC variable valve timing system to produce 270 horsepower (uprated to 290 for 1997). In an effort to boost somewhat disappointing sales, Honda introduced a targa-topped version of the car for 1995 designated NSX-T. What the open version loses in structural rigidity (a minimal loss, thanks to additional reinforcing members), it more than gains in open air pleasure.Everyone is aware of ricers, and how they love to take their cars and throw in a bunch of performance parts on their Japaneese imports. Well, here is a car that comes "pre-riced" without all the ugly big wings and bodywork of cars you may have seen in "Fast and the Furious", the cheezy motion picture about street racing. The NSX outperforms most cars in production, looks better and more exotic than most cars, and has a fun factor much higher than most other cars. 

A cockpit swathed in perforated leather is the main year-2000 change for the high-priced high-performance sports car from Honda's upscale division.Both models in 2000 come two ways: with 6-speed manual transmission and a 290-horsepower 3.2-liter V6, or with 4-speed automatic and a 252-horsepower 3.0-liter V6. The automatic has Acura's SportShift feature that allows manual gear selection via a"paddle"switch on the steering column. Traction control, antilock brakes and power steering are standard. The new perforated leather trim replaces unperforated hide on seats, door panels, steering wheel and handbrake handle. Acura also claims improved manual-shift action for 2000, and both NSX engines are newly certified to LEV (low-emissions-vehicle) standards. 

The cars traction is quite magnificent, and had been improved from the earlier NSX models. With upgraded suspension, and higher traction wheels coming standard from the factory, the 2000 NSX is a magnificent Japaneese import. The car's handling is superb( a .88g on the skidpad), it gives a low-to-the-ground feeling while maintaining a stable stance. There is only a slight oversteer which is expected from any sports car. 

Personal Impressions 

As you approach the car, you are tempted to run instead of walk to the door. The stance of the car in park is not only impressively powerful, but beautiful. The lines of the NSX are magnificently strong and appropriate for such a sports car. I personally appreciate the tail light configuration on the NSX, it is truly a genius styling element. Once you open the door, it is fun time, and you know it before you even turn the key. Once the ignition is turned, you put it into 1st gear(only a fool gets it in auto), and get ready for "blast-off". The seat was very condusive to a sports car, I felt good support, especially laterally when taking sharp turns. The engine is super loud, you really need to get the revs over 4000 to hear it purr. The dashboard, and center console is very plain and outdated, but I believe that's the way a sports car should be. The driver should be focused on the road, not the button for the stereo. If your concerned about you GPS, and DVD components, go buy a Hummer(not the H2). The transmission is incredibly smooth in this car. The stick glides flawlessly through the 6 gears. The great thing about this car, much like a porsche, you can take just about anywhere. The car isn't so expensive, like a Ferrari, where you have to be paranoid about people touching it. Yet, the NSX is still very exotic, fast, and fun to drive. I would encourage everyone to test drive this car even if you can't afford it. It is a real thrill.What makes this car so very desirable, is the everyday element of the car, which allows you to feel like an f1 driver no matter what the weather is, no matter where you are. 

The one complaint that I've heard about it from people whom I know that own it is that it eats tires like no other. So, if you buy this car, be ready to buy a new set every 10k or so miles. However, thats just a minor inconvenience seeing as how these cars require minimal service and are very reliable. So, basically, just think of it as putting your servicing money into new tires.
