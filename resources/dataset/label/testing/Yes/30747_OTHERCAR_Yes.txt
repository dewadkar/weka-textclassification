            This was my first digital camera, and I will look back on it fondly.  It was the camera that I used when my daughter was born, so it got a lot of use!  I can't believe I've only owned it for 6 months and I've already retired it.  It's not the camera's fault, but I had to move up to a camera with a higher resolution.  I passed it on to my brother, who is also very happy with the camera.

I am quite pleased with the camera's images.  They look better with more light, but it also has a flash that works well.  Most folks say red-eye reduction is a joke on cameras, but this one worked most times.

Battery life was adequate, and uploading over the supplied serial cable was simple, if slow.  I also liked the 3 different sized jpeg files that the camera used.  Regular resolution worked great for web photos, while SHQ (high quality) produced awesome 4x6 and 5x7 prints.  I've also ordered 8x10 prints from ezprints.com, and they turn out well.  They still look a little pixelated, but put them in a frame and hang them on a wall, and you can't really tell.

The only problem I had was the instructions for deleting all images on the smartmedia card only worked when connected to the pc.  If I was out, I had to select each one individually to delete.  This is contrary to the manual's instructions.  I don't know if it was a defect with my camera, or an incorrect manual.  It was something I didn't really mind, and was usually able to ignore.

If it helps, I made sure that my next camera would also be an Olympus, the C-3000.  I was outgrowing the D340R because I want to make larger prints, and I also want a camera that allows me to save as uncompressed TIFF format.  USB support, missing from the D340R, was another reason I upgraded.<br><br>
