            I recently ordered a Nikon Coolpix 880 from sales guy Dave O from Xtremeshopper.com, and I was all set to do 'battle' to make sure that I got the advertised price from the internet.  Gomez had rated Xtremeshopper as highest 3-star rated, but tri-state photo equipment suppliers do have a national 'reputation'.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a professional, experienced salesperson on the line.  

I was aware that my camera would be a gray market item, for that low advertised price, but I was pleased to learn that I would be getting a upgraded 5 yr US warranty, instead of the usual 3 yr, from Mack Camera.  Mack supplies warranty services for many, many photo retailers who specialize in gray market equipment, and they seem to have a good reputation, from my research.  Also, US Nikon packages only came with 8mb CF cards, and Dave warned me that the shipping dept will probably substitute the 8mb for the European 16mb... again, to keep their prices as low as possible.  I agreed to the 8mb, because that's what was in the real US packages anyway.  

The total price was still less that 75% of other retailers, more than $100 less than Best Buy here in Dallas.  

So now came my turn to wait.

I got an email immediately that reported my order had been shipped, with an 8mb CF, but a 3 yr Mack warranty, so I 'replied' back to get a UPS tracking #.  Never heard back from that... I'm assuming that it must have been some sort of auto-email.  Several days later, I contacted Dave O directly again, who transferred me to Shipping, who was unable to find any tracking number.  I tried again the next day, but still no number... however, I was assured it had shipped on the date of my auto-email.

A couple of days later, after reading about other shady NYC photo dealers' fake backorder tactics, I got pretty nervous.  I called directly to Shipping, read the guy my order # from my auto-email, and he immediately gave me a UPS tracking #.  Unbelieveable!  It showed that it was scheduled to be delivered that very day!  However, only a UPS note was waiting on my door when I arrived home.  UPS (well, actually the dealer) required a signature during delivery, not just a signed doorknob hanger.  I spent a couple of days chasing the UPS guy around, but finally I found him, opened the box and found my beautiful camera, a 16mb CF card, and the 5 yr warranty, just like Dave O had promised.  Not only that, he had tossed in a new Sandisk USB CF card reader for free!  (Your mileage will vary, I'm sure)  

All in all, I'm very pleased... my price, my delivery time, my promised accessories, and my surprise freebie!
