            A few months ago, one of my coworkers was in the market for a new car and decided on a Mazda 626.  On our lunch hour one day, I drove him to the dealership in my trusty Prelude and spotted the 2001 Mazda Protege.  I had seen it the week before at an automotive show and was impressed with the finish of the interior--white faced gauges, a natty touch of silver, and textured plastics placed here and there. "What the heck." I figured, "as long as I'm here." 

And so I took it for a test drive.  Later that night I drove it home.  

<b>Exterior</b> 
The Protege is an attractive car.  The front end is all new for this model year, featuring a pointed grille and hood crease that mimic the lines of Acura automobiles.  The one piece front headlamps add a bit of upscale attitude.  The rear end is the ugliest side of the car--looking a bit flat and boxed in.  My 2.0 ES came standard with a rear deck spoiler that improves the rear fascia.  Also standard on the ES are sixteen inch alloys with low profile tires, which add to both the looks and handling.

<b>Interior</b> 
As I said, the interior was one of the first things that attracted me to the Protege.  The white faced gauges are lit red at night--a steal from BMW.  The color was a bit annoying for the first few weeks, but I actually like it now.  The audio controls are large and well made, with the sort of light touch that Lexus audio systems have.  The sound is more than acceptable, if a bit bassy for my tastes.  The climate controls are low on the console, operated with knobs (I prefer buttons, but at least there are no sliding controls).  The CFC free air doesn't feel cold enough coming out to me, but it does a quick job of reducing the South Carolina heat. 

The seats are comfortable, though I long for the side bolster and lumbar support of my Prelude.  The black two-tone fabric is a low point.  It looks great when its clean, but keeping it that way requires twice weekly touch ups with a vacuum and lint brush.  The only other complaint I have with the interior is the lack of rear seat pockets, and the placement of the cheapish door locks--right at the top of the door where I wish I could rest my arm.

<b>Driving the Protege</b>
One of the most remarkable things about the Mazda is how quiet it is.  Even at highway speeds, there is very little road noise.  Mazda's engineers did a very good job of soundproofing the cabin.  The engine is plenty powerful, cruise control holds even on steep grades, and passing and acceleration are more than what you might expect from a car in this class.  The five speed manual gearbox is smooth and easy, eliminating "shift shutter" even on quick shifts.

<b>Overall</b>
A friend of mine had a 1995 Protege that was highly reliable through over 60,000 miles. I haven't had a chance to see if it holds true for the 2001, but the 1995 I am familiar with would put an SUV to shame on slick roads. Resale values are good for well-kept examples, and Consumer Reports has consistently given the Protege high marks.  Entry models can be had for under $14,000, and a fully loaded example will cost about what a mid-line Civic LX does.  
I have averaged just under 30 mpg in trafficy city driving--a blessing in this day of high gas prices.  Mazda's 3 year-50,000 mile warranty is better than most, and rebates are frequently offered. I would recommend the Protege to anyone who wants a lot of style without paying a lot of money.

UPDATE
Now, one and a half years and 23,000 miles later, some more thoughts on the Protege.  There have been a few minor problems, all covered under warranty.  The CD player jammed, the drivers side door seal fell out...but thats it.  My major complaint is with how the seats have worn.  The black fabric has not held up as well as one would hope on the front seat bolsters.  When money allows, I plan to replace the factory interior with two tone leather.  My other complaint is how the car has burned up tires! The factory tires could have used replacement 4,000 miles ago, and are now downright dangerously bald! Otherwise, the Protege is a pleasing, low cost car. 

UPDATE TWO
Almost three years and 50,000 miles behind the wheel of the Protege. I've had no more warranty claims, the seats haven't shown any more significant wear, and overall my opinion of the car is still high. Maintenance costs are higher than one might expect of a car in this class, mostly because of its hunger for tires. Expect to drop $400 to $600 every 20,000 miles for new ones. The factory rims will accept only "performance" tires that offer no mileage warranty. The car is just now due for its first brake job and the original equipment windshield wipers have finally given up the ghost.
