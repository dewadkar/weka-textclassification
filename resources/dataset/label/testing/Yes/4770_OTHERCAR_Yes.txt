            I'm about 29 months into a 39 month lease, and I have to say that I have been entirely thrilled with my 1998.5 A4 Avant Quattro 2.8. My only regret: I did not get the optional sport package (stiffer suspension and sportier tires). The car has been great. Zero reliability issues - never had even the slightest problem. Audi's purchase/lease program includes scheduled maintenance as part of the deal, so even 15,000 and 30,000 mile tuneups are gratis. The car is simply excellent in rain, snow, sleet or hail. MUCH better than the SUVs I've owned. They are a joke compared to this car on a slippery road (of course, the A4 can't compete on rutted jeep tracks - but that's not where I drive!). It is a supremely confidence-inspiring car in any kind of bad conditions. But it's also great in good conditions. It's a great daily driver, and when you want to push it a bit, it's eager to please. It's a great highway cruiser on long trips, and it's a blast to drive on twisty back roads. There are not too many wagons that can make that claim. To top it off, even my dealer experience has been good (wow). My only complaints were the suspension - which in my opinion is too soft (too much dive and roll) for a car which otherwise delivers such impressive performance. The optional sport package apparently remedies this to some degree; or you can go all out and get the 'S' model - which adds lots more horsepower, even better brakes and even sportier suspension. When my lease is up; I'll be heading right back to my Audi dealer to get one of those.
