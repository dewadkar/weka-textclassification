            I have a 1993 Nissan Sentra and I will probably drive it until it dies.  It is the best car I have ever had.  We bought it used and this is the first year I have ever had to do any kind of work on it (brakes, tires, etc) other than oil changes and regular maintenance.  I think that is great for a used car.  When my husband and I first looked at it I was worried that is would be too small for our needs.  When we test drove it I was surprised how roomy it was for a small car.  It is not a large car by any means but sometimes smaller cars are uncomfortable for sitting any length of time.  We even sat in the back seat for part of the test drive and was surprised how comfortable and roomy it was for a small car.  I must admit whomever owned the car before us took excellent care of it which makes a difference when buying a used car.  If I could afford a new car I would definitely buy a Nissan.  This car does excellent on gas mileage and is great for travel.  It has a roomy trunk and my husband is 6 feet tall and fits comfortably in it.  This car is easy to drive and handling is great.  This is an excellent purchase if you are on a budget but want an economical car that is very dependable.<br><br>
