I drive a 1997 BMW 328IS with sports package and almost every option except CD changer.

Compared extensively with other sporty-cars in the $30-40k range, including Saab, Audi, Infiniti, Lexus, Honda...

BMW outperforms other cars in one thing:  driving performance.  My BMW rides on rails, is quick handling, accelerates well... is all around great fun to drive.  And it looks good and I get kudos from friends.  I also love the driver-centric &quot;cockpit&quot; which unfortunately has been discontinued.  

Downside.  If you had only yourself to transport around, this is great, but if you want to haul others around, get small friends so they can easily climb into the back.  Also, don't get too much luggage, especially if you leave golf clubs in your trunk.  Last but most, if you drive a lot in the snow, think twice!  No matter what BMW tells you about All Season Traction or how many videos they show you of BMWs driving great in the snow... they don't!  They are hell in the snow.  <p>
