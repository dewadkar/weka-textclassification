Saturn Vue 2002

The big honchos at Saturn have finally decided to enter the SUV market. It took then a while but I am certain that like all the other Saturn products they wanted to enter this market with a winner. 

Recently I read that GM predicts that the sport utility vehicle market would increase by 45% before 2005. The Vue is one way for them to take a good share of this growing segment of the automobile market. 

When shopping for a Vue, consumers have a choice between an in-line 4 cylinder that will give you 143 horsepower or a V6 engine with 181 horsepower. 

I had the opportunity to drive both SUV and I prefer the V6 engine, not only for the extra power but it also seem to give a smoother acceleration and ride. The automatic transmission is a VTi or Variable Transmission, it does take sometime to get use to it. 

When you step on the gas to get some acceleration you have the feeling that the transmission has gone into neutral for a few seconds. I was told that this is the way this type of tranny works and that it is normal. Although the Vue is a few inches smaller that the Explorer, one could not tell the difference at least with the interior of the Vue. 

The front cabin is very designed, the driver has every controls easily accessible. There is lots of head and legroom for the front occupants as for the rear seat area the space is OK but the back rest of the seat is very low and it can be uncomfortable for a tall person. 

The rear seat itself is a 70/30 folding type, this allows more options to transport people and cargo at the same time. The folding procedure is as simple as simple can be. The Vue comes equipped with a Cargo Organizer, this is a great idea. 

What it does is that it prevents let say groceries for instance to be spilled around while you are traveling around until you reach your final destination. 

If you are in the market for a SUV, it is worth the time to take a look at the Vue and take it out for a spin.
