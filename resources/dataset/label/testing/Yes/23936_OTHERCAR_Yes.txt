               This is my new love!!  I have owned the 280D and 300E Mercedes prior to buying my new 2000 SLK.  Nothing compares, even other Mercedes.  I drove the Boxster first and then bought the SLK. 
   I love the way the top goes down in seconds.  I can put it up or down while stopped at a red light.
   The SLK comes with almost everything already included.  It is so ahead of its time, all the roadsters at the LA car show are trying to catch up with it.  It is so easy to operate everything while driving, such as CD, radio, tape, etc.  
   It handles well and is fast enough for driving everyday, since I'm not a racer.  I love driving with the top down and the sun shining on me.  The great little mesh screen keeps my hair in place.  
   If I had to pick one thing to improve, it would be the driver's seat adjustment.  I know this is not a large car, but an auto seat adjuster would be great.  
   The only thing I really hate about this car is that I didn't buy one two years ago!!  People who should buy the SLK - anyone who doesn't have more than one other person to drive at a time.  People who should not drive the SLK - Shy people who can't take the looks and attention of driving this hot car.<br><br>
