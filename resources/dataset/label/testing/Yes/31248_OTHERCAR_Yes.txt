            I bought my Grand Am in the spring of '96, and just traded it today.  Although I experienced some problems, it is one of my all time favorite cars.    

I bought a '95 Grand Am SE Coupe(2 door), Quad 4 2.3 liter engine, power windows/locks, automatic trans.,  air, cruise, SE front (fog lights, air dam), and was purple with black interior.  

It was the most comfortable car I have owned.  I had numerous comments on the comfort of the seats.  I spent an hour and a half every day, sometimes 7 days a week, traveling back and forth to work.  Comfort was important for me.  Being 6'1", I had always put the seat all the way back, but didn't have to with this car.  It was close, but not all the way.  I think it had about an inch left.  One drawback was the legroom in the back seat, especially directly behind me.  

There were other complaints about the interior, so I might as well get that out of the way now.  
*  The cupholder placement was terrible. I resorted to using the ashtray for cans even though I smoke, the others on the dash compartment door were messy and tough to reach.
*  The power window switch placement was awkward.  The switches were located on the console.  Every single person that rode in the car, including me, had trouble with the placement.  I got used to it, my passengers never did.
*  Water rolls in the window when slightly open.  This made it tough to use the cupholder on rainy days, and the water dripped onto the door lock switch.
*  The passenger seat adjuster handle to move seat forward or back broke.  I had to reach under the seat to adjust if needed, so I left it all the way back.
*  The engine heated up at idle, but would cool down after the car started moving.  It never overheated, but started to get really bad around 135,000 miles.
*  The developed a tick at 40,000 miles, and got worse with the life of the car, but never had an effect on the performance. (Quad 4)
*  The transmission blew a ring bearing at about 135,000 miles.  I put in a used transmission because of the high miles.  I figured the used one would be good for the rest of the life the car had in it.  I also wanted to get a new car.
*  The gas door froze the second winter I had it, and I had to pry it open.  This action broke the door latch, but I needed gas and couldn't find a release for it in the trunk. I ended up just bending the door part of the latch to hold it almost closed.  
*  Gas mileage was pretty poor considering it was a 4 cylinder.  My driving style doesn't help either, but I could get double the gas mileage in my wife's 4-cyl. Cavalier, and I drove that hard too.
*  The driver's side power window failed twice.  One time it was fixed under the extended warranty.  The second time was shortly before trading it in, but would start working again when the car sat off for a bit.  It would then work completely fine again for a few days, or a few minutes.

I am happy that I owned this car, even with the problems I have had.  I believe ANY car can have these very same problems.
