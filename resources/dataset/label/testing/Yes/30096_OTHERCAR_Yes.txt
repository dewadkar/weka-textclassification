            I shopped for quite awhile before finally purchasing a Digital Camera.  And I settled for the Kodak DC-280. I didn't need it, but since I had been getting most of my photos processed onto disc and I am at the computer so often I decided to try it.

The Kodak DC-280 was very easy to learn how to and to use.  The pictures are clear and the color has been very accurate (so far).  It comes with all you need to get started and to download to a computer.  I have been using it for about 5 months and it is also very solid.  The battery life has exceeded my expectations.

The price (around $450) was very reasonable for a camera of this quality and with these features.  It's probobly availabe for even less now, though Kodak has introduced a new model (I think the ony change is the Model Number).

This camera is good for anyone who wants to e-mail photos, create web pagesor print or even print them. <br><br>
