            The Nikon 950 is a great camera.  It's actually more camera then I was looking for, but I couldn't pass on the deal that I came across.  The Nikon 950 was selling locally for $750 but then there was $150 mail-in rebate, because the 990 just came out.  So you could get a Nikon 950 for $500!  I looked online and I came across the Nikon 950 Millennium Kit at Computers4sure.com for $800 (and then don't forget the rebate!)
The 950 Millennium is the same camera as the 950 except that it's completely silver and it's individually numbered (0001 to 2000).  The bonus is what it comes with.  It comes with all the same things as the normal 950, but in addition it comes with: 64MB Flash Card, USB Card Reader, Large leather camera bag, small suede camera case, 4 filter with wallet, 4 Ni-MH batteries with charger, and a four year extended warrenty.  For the price I couldn't pass up this deal.

THE GOOD
  This camera can do anything, the manual control let you use it just like a standard 35mm camera.  And the automatic setting lets anyone that can point and click use the camera.  It has so many features, that even after months of owning the camera I'm still learning.  The rotating head of the camera allow you to take pictures from any angle and make everything so much easier.  The design of the camera is very solid and feels very comfortable in your hands.  The interfaces of the menues are really easy to follow and use.  You can preview all the pictures right on the camera in individual slides or in a framed view of nine pictures, this is very nice when you want to scan through a large number of photos.

THE BAD
  The flash seems to be extremely bright in most of the indoor pictures and red eye becomes a problem.  I would recommend having people stand further away and then use the zoom of the camera to take pictures otherwise the people look washed out because of the bright flash.  In outdoor picture taking the LCD is harder to see (but this is a problem for all digital cameras), so don't forget that this camera still has a normal viewfinder.  The last "bad" thing is that every time you turn the camera on the zoom is always reset to full zoom, this is annoying cause I always have to zoom all the way out everytime I turn the camera on.

I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.  It's a great camera that is solidly built that takes excellent photos and has some of the greatest features available in a digital camera.  If you do buy this camera make sure to buy three additional things: 
1. Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries and charger - they are rechargeable and they last much longer than Alkaline or Ni-Cd batteries.  But two pairs so you always have a fresh pair.
2. USB card reader - Serial connection is SLOW!!!  But stay away from the scandisk reader, they are the cheapest for a reason.  I bought a second reader for work and it died after two months and many others have had the same problem.
3. UV filter - The UV filter doesn't really change pictures that much, but it will add a nice level of protection for your lense.  I leave mine all the time for protection, cause it's much easier to buy a new inexpensive UV filter than it is to replace the camera lens (it's much cheaper too!)
If you only want a camera to take a few pictures, then this might be too much camera for you.  But if you intend on using this camera for years and take lots of pictures, then I only have the best things to say about this camera.
