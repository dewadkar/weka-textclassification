            If you're considering to buy a car, go to www.carbuyingtips.com first to educate yourself like I did.

I bought this car in satin silver w/o the spoiler on 12/13/02 from a fleet manager after 3 months of research & emails to various dealers.  The price was $22,400 out the door, so I got a really good deal out of them.  It now has 3000 miles on it.

This car accelerates quickly with no hesitation even over a steep incline, unlike my friend's 2002 Toyota Solara V6.  This makes passing other cars a joy!  The ride is not as soft as Toyota Camry, it has stiffer suspensions I think modeled after VW.  The steering is very responsive since a guy almost ran into me last weekend & I had to swerve quickly to avoid him (he would not want to face my wrath if he did hit me hahaha).  

The seats are really comfortable, especially the lumbar support.  A friend sat in my car, and the first thing she said was how nice the lumbar support was.  I go home every month to my parents' which is 2.5-3hrs away over a mountain/hill and flat freeway in CA, and my body doesn't feel tired or achy afterwards.  It is a bit awkward for me to get out of the car due to the high sides of the bucket seat, but i think that is the norm with a sports coupe.  Plus the high sides tucks you in when driving & keeps you from swaying during turns.  Since mine is a LX, it came with black cloth seats.  The cloth is excellent material, feels really nice to to the touch.  But it collects lint/fur like crazy.  I ended up putting towels on the front seats (because of the side airbag) & an afgan in the back.  

The car is very roomy, tho not as much as the Solara in the back.  I love the interior design with its big bright dashboard, storage compartments, cupholders, etc.  The backseat is surprisingly roomy, altho i think 3 would be a squeeze.  The stereo is soooo nice with a nice bass.  

Now to the not so good parts.  

A month ago, i noticed that if the stereo is off & i'm driving below 40 mph, there is this high, faint whistling noise from the front left side.  The front left dashboard occasionally squeaks a bit when going over bumps.  Occasionally, the car wouldn't start right away so i have to turn the ignition the 2nd time.  I took the car in & told the service person the problems.  He told me the ignition is a timing thing particular to Honda & it's nothing to worry about.  Other owners have also complained about the ignition & rattling noise from dashboard.  And he couldn't hear the whistling noise I'm hearing.  2nd time I took it in for test drive, a different mechanic finally heard it.  He test drove a new same model from the lot & told me it had similar sounds, so he said if the noise gets louder, then come back.  That was last week.  I can still hear the noise, altho I can't say if it's getting louder or not.  I figured I'll wait a couple of months & see what happens.  Maybe I'll test drive a new one myself when I have time.  It hasn't affected anything about the performance.

If you take your car in for service where they have to keep the car for a day or 2, the dealer here in San Jose doesn't give you a free rental like Nissan did for me.  I don't know if that's true across the board, but that's a minus for me on service.

I still love this car, it's a joy to drive it.  I may be biased, but I love the backend of the car the best!
