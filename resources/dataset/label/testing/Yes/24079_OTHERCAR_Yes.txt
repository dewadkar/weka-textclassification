            This camera is good for taking auction pictures, party pictures, snap shots, and pictures that you wouldn't want the people developing your pictures to see (Know what I mean?  Wink wink, nudge nudge.), but I'm not about to sell my Canon.

It's great to have around because it's digital, and you don't have to pay for processing, but it has some set backs.  There's no zoom lens, and you can't change lenses.  It's tempermental when I use an AC adapter, after the first picture it will either shut off or stick as it saves the picture.  When you take pictures at less than about five feet, more than what you framed in the viewfinder shows up in the pictures.

Sometimes when I try to take pictures for auctions indoors, and no matter what lighting I try the pictures just don't come out right.  It makes me kind of hesitant to use when taking pictures that are important.  If you really want to get picky, the software makes the pictures into bitmap files rather than jpegs, although I hear Sony digital cameras take pictures in some strange format they invented which would be even more annoying.

Picture quality is usually pretty good, as long as you don't look too close, or zoom in on it with software.

I bought a 4MB memory card for it for $19.95 (egghead.com auction), which will give me about 16 more high resolution pictures, in addition to the 8 or so I get with the 2MB card that came with it.  I have a laptop to take with me and upload to, so that should be enough to supplement my Canon on vacation.

One last thing, it will work as a webcam, and can capture video when it's hooked up to your computer.  This is highly UNRECCOMENDED if you don't have an AC adapter, because you'll go through the battery fast, and they're about $9.50.

Hmm, since epinions won't let me use HTML for this review, I'll make a web page with sample pictures at:
