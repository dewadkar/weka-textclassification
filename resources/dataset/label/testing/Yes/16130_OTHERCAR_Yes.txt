            I recently had the oppurtunity to test drive the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  First of all, this is probably one of the nicest suvs out there.  It seems like it is just the right size for a suv.

Probably my favorite thing about this Jeep was the Powertech V8.  This 245hb engine really makes the Jeep go!  With a zero to 60 time around 7 seconds, that puts this heavy suv in the range of a lot of cars out there.  One disadvantage to such a powerful engine is the gas milage.  But if you are going to buy an suv, you will have to take a hit with your gas mileage.  

The Grand Cherokee has a very comfortable, roomy interior.  The plush leather seats are cushy for hours.  The gauges and radio controls are easy to read and operate.  There is a decent amount of back seat room and cargo space as well.  

Now, to what Jeeps are really known for.  Their impressive 4wd capabilities.  This Jeep sits high above the road, making it very difficult to get stuck in the snow.  The Quadra Drive system is very useful, as it transfers power to the wheels that grip the best, making this an outstanding all-weather vehicle.

The Grand Cherokee isn't the most smooth riding vehicle on the road, but its a suv, so what do u expect?  Also, Jeeps are not known for above average reliability, so if that is a factor, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise this is a fine vehicle to purchase/lease.  The limited I drove had a steep price tag of $35k, but you can find the Laredos for in the late $20s.  

I would recommend this vehicle for younger persons who like the outdoors or familys who have children.  Overall, I would give this vehicle a 8 out of 10 stars.
