            I recently parted with my 1992 Saturn SL2.  I had the 5 Speed automatic with manual doors & windows, cobalt blue exterior (often mistaken for black) and tan interior.  It was my first car, and I acquired it when I was 19, the summer before my Junior year of college.  I bought it used from a dealership (Saturn of Alhambra--the service was good there, but not exceptional) in July of 1997.

I loved having the car.  The acceleration was great for me, I beat out my friend in his '73 Camero automatic in a 1/4 mile strip.  I ran the car rigorously at high speeds for the first 2 years or so, and it always had very responsive handling.  I always felt safe driving it, and I got a discount on my car insurance premium because of the automatic safety belt feature.

Soon after I got it, some wires got crossed inside and the car would ding at me whenever the door was open, trying to tell me that the lights were on even when they weren't.  I got it fixed after we figured out that the alarm wire was touching something else.  What puzzled me was that I didn't even have an alarm (but I'm not a mechanic...).

I had to replace the radiator tanks after I had it for 2 1/2 years (121,000 miles total on the car), and then it ran fine for about a year.  Almost one year later, I started having coolant leaks again, and paid to have them fixed twice, and everything seemed to be fine.

Then, on my exact 4 year anniversary of buying the car, I was taking it to the dealership to have it checked out because it had been overheating and making some noises.  On the way there, my engine block cracked.  It would have cost me $4400 to get it fixed, and I decided that it was too much for me to afford.  So I sold the car to one of the mechanics at the dealership (Saturn of Fresno, very helpful staff and great service).  

I loved that car, and several times while I was out shopping at home improvement warehouses, people asked me if I was filming a Saturn commercial because I was cramming so much stuff inside my car.  The cargo room was great--WAY roomier than it looks from the outside.
