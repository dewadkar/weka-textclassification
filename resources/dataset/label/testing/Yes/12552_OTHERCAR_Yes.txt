            I have not owned this truck very long yet, but I am already VERY happy with the performance, handling, looks, FUEL MILEAGE!! ETC....

I have always been a Chevy Lover, having had about 3 Chevy 1-tons, but this 1/2 ton is VERY nice also.  I have also had a couple of Fords over the past couple of years, and in my opinion, this Chevy Silverado is MUCH better.

I have the EXT cab with 4 doors, and I love it!!  I had a 99 F150 with 4 doors before, but Chevy is MUCH roomier and more easy to get in and out of.

I have also had both Ford and Chevy Crew Cabs (3/4 ton and 1-tons) But the overall length, and wheelbase brought me to the Silverado EXT cab this time.

Overall I LOVE it and would buy again.  I bought it from a dealer with 12K miles (used) It has the LS package, with a bunch of options, such as towing package, Leather seating, ONSTAR, 5.3 engine, automatic with TOW/HAUL mode, dark blue paint, all power, Keyless......ETC

If you would like to know more, E-mail me.....
