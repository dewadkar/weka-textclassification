            I believe this car was made for the college student to the busy single
people. It's not big enough for carting the family on long trips, but for 2-3
people on long trips its ideal. I affectionately call it &quot;The Boo&quot;.

To give you and idea of where I came from before this, I had a 1985 Honda
Civic Wagon. It was way too small for me (6'3&quot; 230#) and the 4 banger
rice rocket was way too sluggish for my 2 lane highway driving.

So my first requirement for a new car was 6 cylinders. Some of my choices
were a stripped down Monte Carlo (nice car), A stripped down S-10
pickup truck, Pontiac Grand AM, and the Boo. I had started my search with
my heart set on getting a pickup truck, and I had never known anything about
the Boo. Well, the Monte Carlo was out because the only model I could
afford had nothing on it. The Grand AM was small and poorly built. The
S-10 pickup had a 4.3 V-6 which had less pickup power than the Boo's 3.1
V-6.

Overall I've been really happy with my car. Face it, I could only get
something better from what I had. The room in the driver's side is good,
would be nice to have a little more, but I'm comfortable. You can really tell
that Chevy did their homework on this car when designing it. As a Graduate
student with a degree in Mechanical Engineering I was impressed.

This car requires very little thought to use. Automatic lights off/on, interior
light auto shutoff after 15 min (includes reading lamps and trunk light),
alarms and warning lights for everything but a deer stepping in front of you,
great cruise control, keyless remote entry, the key won't pull out of the
ignition unless the car is off and in park (yes that happened to me), speed
compensation volume control

In the driver's seat, everything is very easy to find. All the controls are well
lit at night, even the power window ctrls. With one hand on the wheel and
one resting on the shifter, the radio and climate controls can be controlled
by just moving the right wrist. Very ergonomic.

The fuel gauge gives you about a 2 gallon reserve. It reads dead empty on
13 gal. and the tank has 15 gal. capacity. Nice for when you have to push it
sometimes.  I get 27 MPG City and 33 MPG Highway.

The car carries enough stuff for a college student to move back and forth
from school to home. As long as their is no big things like furniture. It
carries all the stuff I need when I go to New Mexico every summer as a
backpacking instructor for 3 months. Which brings up another point. I have
had to drive to trail heads with my car on a number of times and have had
no problems. I don't do any off roading, but the gravel roads are not a
problem. I drove in my first real encounter with snow in the mountains of
NM last December and had no problems with handling and control. As a
Mississippi boy who doesn't see snow, that's impressive.

The radio sounds good for someone who isn't used to a really good radio
(like me). There is no rumble in the bass and there needs to be a little more
treble. The tweeters (high frequency speakers) are in the door down by the
feet and point towards the person in the seat. The speed compensation
volume control is nice. It isn't perfect, still needs work, but takes the hassle
out of having to change the volume manually.

There is a good amount of power from a dead stop in the engine. Highway
passing power is very good as well. Instant response. Mountain roads in
both New Mexico and North Carolina were a lot of fun to drive on. My
friends couldn't keep up with me.

I drive from Mississippi to New Mexico and back 2 times a year. I have
made this drive twice in my Boo and it was a nice drive. I felt like I was
riding in a Cadalac after making the drive in my Civic. The longest day of
continuous driving I have done in it is about 16 hours. I couldn't have gone
this far in my Civic but the Boo made it possible. I was not sore or anything
after the day was done. Just sleepy.

The fog lamps are worthless, don't get them. I can't tell any difference in
lighting condition when they are on or off. I didn't get the spoiler, I did not
know there was the option at the time. The truth about spoilers is that they
are worthless on any car a normal person would buy. All they do is cause
wind resistance (worse gas mileage) and they don't have any affect on
handling until you reach about 80-100 MPH.

I have had two major problems with this car that the part changers at the
service centers have had difficulty changing. The first is a leak in the engine
coolant. Nearly a year after buying the car and 4 trips to three different
service depts., it was fixed (while I was on a trip going through Texas).
The other problem is that my brake rotors get warped every 2-3 months. I
have had the rotors turned 3 times now (covered under warranty). I think its
a design flaw. The brakes are either too small or I have a faulty braking
system in my car. A third more minor problem is a high pitch wind noise
that happens around 70 MPH. Service dept. hasn't been able to correct it
either. Other warranty work that has been done on it: back adjustment on
passenger seat, loose center console, plastic covers on front struts came
loose

If you change your own oil, there is a couple of annoyances. There is a piece
of weather-stripping plastic cover type thing you have to remove to get to the
oil filter. Also the lead from the battery to the starter is very close to the oil
filter. A slip of the oil filter wrench and you could get a shock. Must have
been over looked by GM.

The reliability is so low only because I followed what the description said
on it. I consider it more reliable than that. I haven't ever been stranded with
it.

Overall I have really enjoyed my car. I know it sounds like I've knocked it,
but I am just very critical about cars (comes from being a Mechanical
Engineer I guess). The pluses have far outweigh the minuses.
