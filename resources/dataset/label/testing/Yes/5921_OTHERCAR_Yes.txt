            I purchased my 1996 Isuzu Rodeo LS about two years ago for 16,100.  It came with a V6 24-Valve engine, and a plethora of options including moonroof, grill guard, chrome trim, and a ski rack.  Other cars I was comparing it to were mostly SUVs (Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder) and also a few family sedans (Nissan Maxima, Mitsubishi Diamante), all were used.  I chose the Isuzu because of it's stylish exterior (the chrome trim looks GREAT when the car is clean), roomy interior (it has more leg room than any of the mid-sized SUVs I've seen), and smooth ride.  

I've put 12,500 miles on the car, and it currently has 76,000.  To this day, I haven't had to service the engine at ALL, and the only type of maintenance it's needed is tire repair.  Another advantage to the car is it's beautiful and comfortable interior.  Allowing ample leg room for all five passengers, the Rodeo also has a huge trunk.  The upholstery is also of the highest quality.

When I first bought the car, I noticed some squeaking while driving at high speeds.  The sounds were a result of improper air flow through the body, rather than engine problems, and have since just gone away.  The Rodeo also feels a little unstable when cornering sharply, and is probably not the best SUV for off-roading.

I would definitely recommend the SUV as a family car.  It's roomy interior and reliability would make it a staple in any household.  <br><br>
