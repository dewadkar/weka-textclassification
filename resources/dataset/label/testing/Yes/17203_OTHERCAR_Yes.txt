            I bought a Honda Civic brand new in 1996. This was my very first new car. There is nothing that I don't love about that car. It was roomy for a compact car, and the performance was outstanding. I got somewhere in the vicinity of 30+ miles to the gallon. The seats are comfy and nice and long. The Civic is also very sporty with a lot of zip. This is the kind of car that works well as a family car but is stylish enough for a night on the town. I would recommend the Civic to anyone who wants to get more out of a car.<br><br>
