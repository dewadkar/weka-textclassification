            Just purchased a 2001 Grand AM GT with the ram air V6. I hadn't even considered it in my select group of cars I was considering. I'd looked at Camaro, Grand Prix, Regal, Maxima, and even a Saturn when I came across one at a Pontiac dealership.
Admittedly, I was looking at a Grand Prix when I walked past a red ram air Grand Am coupe and did a double take. The aggressive styling and very reasonable sticker price of $20,800 grabbed my attention. Still, I wasn't sold. Finally, the salesman came out and asked me if I'd like to try her out. 
I can never turn down a test drive, as I am a certified car nut. Once behind the wheel, the decision was an easy one. This car is made for the driver. Everything in the cockpit is aimed at the driver and it fit like a glove.
I took her for a spin around town and punched the accelerator hard and boy did she respond! This car has outstanding pickup and oomph in the engine! It even sounds fast!
My last several cars have been foreign as I had begun to believe that they were better made. This car makes my last, a 2000 Nissan Altima SE, seem like a car for Grandma. Whereas the Nissan was a "passenger" car aimed at the family, the Grand Am is built for the driver. 
I would highly recommend this car for anyone who is looking for a little fun when behind the wheel. Sure, if you've got kids or haul a lot of cargo this car probably isn't for you. However, if you're a little low on the fun quotient this car is the cure.
One little thing I forgot to mention is the $1500.00 rebate Pontiac is offering on these cars. Better hurry!
