            I bought my Tacoma PreRunner about 7 months ago.  It was used, and in really good condition.  It had approximately 93,000 miles and drove very well.  It now has a little over 102,000 miles and it still drives great.  This truck is modeled like the 4x4 version of the Tacoma, except it is 2-wheel drive.  I really liked that, because it has the cool looks, the nice off-roading abilities, and you don't have the extra expense on your insurance for it being 4x4.  My truck is an automatic 4-cylinder, 2.7 liter extended cab truck, and even though you may think 4-cylinder is really weak for a truck, it has some power.  It has pretty good acceleration, in my opinion, but the top speed isn't at all impressive.  The front seats of the truck are pretty comfortable, it is the 60/40 seat, but I wish there was a storage area between the front seats, instead of the extra seat, which I really don't think a third person can fit there, with a seatbelt on (that includes children)...but I could be wrong.  The back seats in the extended cab part of the truck are pretty comfortable, for an extended cab, but not comfortable enough to ride in for hours.  The brakes work really well, as I have braked hard on them going at extremely fast speeds several times.  If you are heavy into off-roading, I would suggest a 4x4, but the PreRunners get the job done in certain areas...but you may expect getting stuck sometimes.  One of my main complaints about this truck is, there is not much room for modifications to the sound system.  Do not expect to buy this truck and then get a competition sound system...at least without losing a seat or two in the back.  It gets decent gas mileage for a truck, especially considering how high it is, but I would prefer better.  It is pretty quiet inside the truck, and you can't hear much noise on the outside, either.

Another one of my opinions, which I am sure most people would agree with... These trucks will last!  I definitely recommend this truck, unless you are looking forward to towing people...in that case, I would recommend the v6 version.  And if you are really looking forward to off-roading, you would also probably prefer the 4x4 version.  They have a nice off-roading package called the TRD (Toyota Racing Development) off-roading package, which you will find on the rear of the side of the truck if it contains that package.
