            I had an 85 Transam before and was so impressed with the reliability, that I when I decided to get a newer vehicle, it was to be a transam.I bought this car with 200,00 miles on it though because it was all I could afford with the price of these cars. Unfornutely I bought the car in a hurry though and that was my mistake.Though its great now. I had some work I had to put into it. I had not found a mechanic wise to these newer cars as of that time so it cost a little more. Be warned that unless you find a mechanic that is familiar with transams, it is going to cost you a pretty penny for someone to fumble around. These engines are VERY compact. I go to a site now called www.projecttransam.com as well as www.WS6XR.com and I ask questions there. They know the ins and outs of these cars   and the feedback is great to take to your mechanic. They know more stuff than GM! For example when I first purchased my car the engine light would go on but went away after it warmed up. GM did not know what was wrong so I went to the transam site which told me it was a faulty air pump. I took it to GM who told me that there was indeed an air pump recall on my car and they went to fix it. I STILL had problems. I found out through the site they missed replacing a fuse and I took it back and GM apologized for missing that and fixed it.
As for comfort this car is cream of the crop. It is like sitting in a recliner in your living room. The seats also have  side buttons to adjust for back and side lumbar support.
I have never had a problem with the capacity of the car. On Sundays a friend and I sell at the flea market and we bring a ton of items. The back seats also fold down given me added room. I am a tall girl too. 5'11 and getting in and out does not bother me. I have had kids as well in my car and there is easily room for them. It is a little snug in the back though for adults I agree. But it is still not that uncomfortable. 
My choice for T-tops was because when test driving those without them,I felt closed in. I have heard reports of them leaking but I have never come across that problem. The window motors are a headache. I do not suggest buying them new as they are 200 dollars each canadian. The asto van motors are the same so you can get them cheap at an auto wrecker or brand new. Either way its tons cheaper. When it comes to gas mileage I find that on the freeway I get pretty good gas mileage. Its slightly more expensive if your just putting around town but take in consideration this IS a 350 engine. (It is NOT to be mistaken for the firebird with the smaller engine and less features)Plus if you have a heavy foot that should always be taken into account. I put in 10.00 Canadian and I drive around for a few days around town on that. As well the transam engines actually have the power of a 400. But pontiac did not want to promote that as they did not want potential buyers to stray away from their more expensive car line, the corvette. I would also buy a book called "Lemon-Aid for cars." This book has a lot of hidden warranties for your vehicle that GM will not tell you about. This goes for all years of these cars as well. The three biggest things I liked about this car was 1. Safety (These cars rate excellent for safety standards)2. Retaining value.(They hold onto their worth for years to come.3. Looks. I get so many head turns and compliments on this car every time I drive it. I am going to be taking the body and replacing parts and when Im done it will look exactly like the Last 2002 model. Considering I paid 11,000 for it and it will cost me about 3,500 for the parts to make it look like a 40,000 car, I figure it is worth it.
