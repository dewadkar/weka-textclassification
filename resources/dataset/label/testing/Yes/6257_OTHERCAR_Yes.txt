            Nissan makes a very reliable vehicles.  The Nissan Frontier is second only to the Toyota Tecomma in small pickups but coast much less.  I own a 95 Nissan pickup extended cab.  I bought it used in 1998 and I am very happy with my purchase.  With 85,000 miles on it already, it has never had an extensive amount of work done on it.  The coast of regular maintenance and gas is all I have put into it.  Since I bought it in 98 the value has dropped very little compared to other pickups of its class.  I have had offers that would well make me happy to sell it but I choose to keep it because of dependability and enjoyment.  It is fun to drive and gets great gas mileage on the road as well as off the road.  I strongly recommend the Nissan Pathfinder to anyone looking for a small sized pickup.  <br><br>
