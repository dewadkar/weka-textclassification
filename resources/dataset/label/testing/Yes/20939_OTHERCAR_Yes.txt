            I have had my deep cranberry PT Cruiser with all of the bells and whistles for 12 months now, and I still get a kick out of it every day. It is out of character for me to be in love with the looks of a car since I have always treated my vehicles as a basic utility -- more like orthopedic shoes than high-heeled slingbacks. As evidence I submit: My first car was a 1962 Ford Fairlane in-line 6 that I bought for $100 at a police auction in 1970. Then there was a Datsun B210 (remember those?)a Nissan Sentra (cornered like a skate-board)and most recently an Eagle Summit AWD Wagon.  Nonetheless, I fell in love with the looks of the PT Cruiser when I saw a picture of it, and went to the local auto show in February 2000 specifically to see it.  After test driving it the following week, I ordered mine. The dealership did not engage in any price gouging or other financial shenanigans, but there wasn't any "discount" either. The car came in July and I have been tooling about happily ever since. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, the PT Cruiser is still an orthopedic shoe underneath a stylish exterior. It can barely get out of its own way, but for my primarily urban and short point-to-point driving, that's just fine.  If I need to change lanes at high speed, I start planning about an hour in advance. I have made a few longer (4-6 hours) road trips in it and found it quite comfortable. It does have that huge blind spot everyone has mentioned, and that IS irksome, especially after the superior visibility I enjoyed in the Eagle Summit. I've just had to learn to be really careful when moving to the right to turn or change lanes. It is easy to get in and out of, which is especially good for my 76 year old mother, who has limited mobility.  I particularly love the versatile cargo options, as I frequently transport dogs, large shopping hauls, gardening paraphernalia, and my mother's wheelchair. On three occasions this past winter,however, I cursed the lack of all-wheel drive.  If anything could make me trade my Cruiser in for a Subaru Forester, it is our upstate NY winters. I have been happy with the handling and insulation from road and engine noises, but look at my frame of reference! All in all, I am really glad I did something a little impulsive when ordering the PT Cruiser, and I could recommend it without reservation to others in circumstances similar to mine.
