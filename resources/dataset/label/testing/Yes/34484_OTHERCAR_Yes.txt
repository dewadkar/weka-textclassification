            Hey, this is my second review of my car....Its a 1999 with 23,000 miles...I just wanted to let everyone know how its holding up and how pleased i am with it..I have the CDX Leganza and so far I have had it 13 months now (i put alot of miles..lol) anyway the car still feels remarkably solid...I know now I have a good car because my friends Malibu feels really shaky and loose and it has 26k on it...Anyway everything is working great as day 1 and my brakes for some reason dont seem to wear oul lol my old car they went at like 20 k the way i drive but these still feel new and my doors still shut with a thunk. In all I really can say i think that I bought a REALLY REALLY good car..:-) Ive driven accords and they dont impress me at all my car feels and runs just as good and looks alot better. My accelleration seems to have improved with time as well...oh one other thing....the leather at first didnt seem like Lexus quality lol but what I have realized now is that soft leather no matter how luxurious isnt the best because I see now how well the leather is holding up in my Leganza it doesnt crack and it still looks new.In all i love my Leganza and woulnt trade it for a Honda NO WAY! I think Daewoo has something to prove...that Korean cars can be as good as Japanese and I think they have almost done it ! :-)<br><br>
