            May 2002 Update
---------------
S330 supersedes this camera in price and features.
I think I'd still go for the S110 though.  Either
the S330 or S110, you can't go wrong.


Nov. 16, 2001 Update
---------------------
The review below was written
in August, 2001.  At the time, the Cannon S110 was just
announced and actually more expensive than the S300.  The
S110 at this point has almost identical features to the
S300 (2X zoom instead of 3X maybe the most significant
difference and disadvantage) and is just a bit lower in
price.   I think right now I'd go for an S110 instead,
because it is even smaller than the S300.

Aug. 2001 Review
-----------------
I've read most of the reviews on this camera before I bought it. I wont give an extremely long drawn out hypertechnical review here. What often gets lost in these reviews is the most important aspect of this camera: it's small. What's so important about small ? Well, small is everything. With a camera this small, it fits in your pocket. If the choice is between carrying around a normal sized camera or taking one of these babies in your pocket, there's no comparison. I bought mine a few months back and have spent the summer with it in my pocket wherever I go. Little league ball games. Vacations. Wherever.
On the technical side, the camera takes outstanding pictures. It's a 2.1 Megapixel (1600 X 1200 pixel) camera, so it's not on the leading edge (3 megapixels have been out a while now). But 2 megapixels are plenty. This is more than twice what you need for a sharp display on a computer monitor or to print out an 8" X 11" photo on a printer. The camera comes with a puny 8MB compact flash card, so I'd suggest you pick up a 64MB or 128MB card to store pictures. Figure you'll store 2 to 3 pictures per MB, so 64MB will store over 128 pictures and a 128MB will store over 256 pictures. A 64 MB card will cost you about $50.

Compared To My Previous Digital Camera - Epson PhotoPC750
---------------------------------------------------------
My last digital camera was an Epson PhotoPC750(1 Megapixel, circa 1998).  It received an outstanding review from PC Magazine at the time.   This camera went belly up on me twice.  I think it had a lot to do with the mostly plastic
construction on the Epson.  

Compared to my Epson PhotoPC750 this camera excels in quite a few areas.  Lets not even talk about size.  The 95% metal body design of the S300 is welcomed given my prior experience.  It has a jog dial on the top which is very handy to allow you to choose various modes (playback, manual, automatic, movie). The camera is very quick (few seconds) between modes (the Epson took close to 5 seconds - extremely annoying). The controls are much easier to navigate on this camera than the Epson. The 3X Zoom on the camera is a really nice addition (forget about digital zoom - they're always crappy), and I like how the zoom button slides from optical into digital zoom when the optical is exhausted. The cartridge battery on the camera lasts longer than I'd expected from the reviews, and is more of a snap to load and charge than the Epson individual batteries were. I find night shots of the camera work a lot better as well. I haven't used the movie mode that much so I cannot comment on it too heavily, other than it's use is limited since you can only take small ( less than 30sec) movies.

The biggest negative often sited for this camera is price,
which I find on zdnet.com to be currently at $459, the same
price I paid for my Epson 2 years ago.  I wholeheartedly disagree that this camera is not worth every penny, because
Cannon has seen to it that you'll take it with you (size) and it'll last (design).   And the picture quality is excellent.  You won't be disappointed.
