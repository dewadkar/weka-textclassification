            The Kodak DC215 ZOOM is the greatest digital camera I have ever used. It makes for a
great photo. I own a DC215 and I enjoy it's price, Capabilities and handling, and it's fun
factor.

For one, the price is low. Although it was not when I bought it brand New/ Top of the
Line from Kodak. Two years or so ago, it sold for $450 and I thought that it was low
enough for a digital camera, but now, a brand new one costs around $250. Yes there are
digital cameras out there that sell for very much less to nothing, but those are of low
quality.

Quality is a hard think to find in today's digital camera market. The DC215 exemplifies
quality in it's one megapixel two time optical zoom/ three digital. On this camera, you can
chose one of three different picture quality and two types of resolution. That makes for
excellent photographs and family fun taking them.

I brought this camera to all my familyï¿½s events, such as Christmas and birthdays. I have
never had more fun at Christmas than the last time I brought my DC215 with. The kids
loved watching themselves on the TV with an included RCA connector cable. The
DC215 is elderly and child friendly too.

Friendly is a good way to describe the camera. It also carries features that you could only
find on a high-end camera. I would strongly recommend this camera to you if you are
looking for a dependable, solid, and trustworthy Digital camera.
