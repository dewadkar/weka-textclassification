            I have owned the same Ford Explorer since 1992.  I originally purchased the Explorer because I liked the way it looked.  I keep this Explorer because of the performance that it gives me.  This is the only vehicle that I would like to have. It drives like a car, but has the room of a van.  I have not had any problems with mine.  I now have over 200,000 miles on this one and it is still running like new.  It still gets excellent gas mileage.  My next vehicle will be another Explorer.  <br><br>
