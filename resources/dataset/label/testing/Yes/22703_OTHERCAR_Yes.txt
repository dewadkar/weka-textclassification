            The Neon seems to attract a lot of dislike. I bought mine in 1997 just before the manufacturer's warranty expired. I test drove one without power steering... trust me, it needs power steering.

The only time I needed to have anything other than routine maintenance done was when the O2 sensor failed and the &quot;check engine&quot; light came on. Other than that, the car has behaved well from a mechanical perspective.

The car handles very well when the roads are dry, much better than many of the others I have driven. In the wet it handles more more poorly, though not worse than average.

One of the best things about this car is its fuel economy. I can always get at least 270 miles off a tank, sometimes around 300 miles.

My gripes: 
There is a lot of engine, road and wind noise when driving, and the windows seem to work themselves slowly downward. Every couple of weeks I have to turn them back up. Also the car's proximity to the ground makes it easy to damage the underside. The speed bumps at a friend's apartment complex completely wrecked the wiring under the car, which took out my air conditioning. Finally, when it is even slightly windy, I can really feel it, much more than is normal for a car this size.

In conclusion - I like this car and haven't had any major problems with it.<br><br>
