            If your going to buy a car, I think it should be the Maxima. WHY?

1. The Sport Edition(SE) starts at 23,849. That isn't much according to some other cars. With all the extra features it will cost 29,979.

2. Safety features. I bet everyone wants to keep themselves and their friends and family safe. There are air bags, side air bags, active head restraints that reduce whiplash injuries, LATCH SYSTEM secures kids without seatbelts, and Immobilizer System that makes it impossible for a person to steal your car.

3. The 222 horsepower V6 engine is better than the 200 horsepower Accord. The Maxima and the Accord are a lot alike, but the Maxima wins here. The Maxima also is a good braking and handling car. 

4. The interior is great. Heated power seats, flush vents, dual level armrest, split rear seat, steering wheel mounted control, automatic temperature control, auto dimming rear view mirror, and Bose audio system.

I don't know what else to tell you, but if you want more you could always go to there wabsite. That's what i did.
