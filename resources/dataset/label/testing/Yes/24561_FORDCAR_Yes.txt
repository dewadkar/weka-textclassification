            I bought an F-150 because it was the first full-size truck I found which had what I needed: extended cab and 5-speed (just try to find a Chevy or Dodge with THAT combo).  So I really wasn't brand loyal.

What I like: 
1. Ride- almost too soft my my tastes.
2. Power- plenty enough for doing whatever is necessary (like carrying eight 200lb railroad ties).
3. Transmission- good shift quality from the Mazda-built 5-speed.
4. Seats- very comfortable.
5. Parts- cheap to repair, easy to service.
6. Mileage- 18-22mpg
7. Handling- takes corners at a much higher speed than a vehicle of this size should.
8. No rattles, squeaks, or other wierd noises

What I don't like:
1. Paint on hood is easily chipped.
2.   <br><br>
