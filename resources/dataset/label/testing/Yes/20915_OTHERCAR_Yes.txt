            OK, I bought the car for the looks.  I've never been tempted to do that before, but this car had me from the time I first read about it over a year ago.  Now I've had the car for about six weeks and I've got to say, it is the best.

It is roomy, comfortable, appointed with all the bells and whistles and well built.  I live on a back country road and rattles and shakes are evident in new cars within a week or so, but not in this car.  It remains tight, quiet and a lot of fun to drive.  

It handles well, has enough power for normal driving, and has room enough for three golden retrievers (with the back seats removed.)  The doors open wide enough (front and back) to allow easy access to the car for canines and humans, and the amount of headroom and legroom surprised me.  In fact, the car is full of surprises, not the least of which is the number of people I've met because they want to talk about the car.

If there is anything I don't like about the car, it might be the placement of the rear window power switches - I find them awkward to find while driving.  And it would be lovely if the rear windows went all the way down.  Big deal.  I can live with these.

I'd highly recommend the car to anyone who is looking for a good, functional, economical car.  I'm not sure I'd want to mount a couple of child seats into it, but for a car for commuting to work, or a play car, or even a car for hauling the what-have-yous of life, it is a winner.<br><br>
