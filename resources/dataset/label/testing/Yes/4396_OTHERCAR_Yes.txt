It is difficult to summarize with mere ascii characters that which is the Land Rover D90.  In a world of SUVs which look tough but in reality are far better suited for taking you to the start of the trail at the bottom of the mountain than the end of the trail at the top, we find this wonderful anachronism.  I've tried really hard to break my truck.  I've tipped it on it's side, I've had it completely airborne (professional driver on closed track-type disclaimer applies), I've had it 4 feet deep in the middle of freezing rivers, and no matter how much abuse I dish out, it's never left me walking.  If you're looking for something to take you to the top of the mountain, this is your vehicle.

That said, it's loud (there's no sound insulation at all - this is the only vehicle I know where you can hear the gears whine), it's hot (there's no A/C and there's no heat insulation to keep the engine/driveline heat out of the cab), and I don't find the seats particularly comfortable (but I'm tall - many people don't have this problem).

There are also some issues with the transmissions in early '94s, but mine's been holding up fine.

One of the major merits of this vehicle for my purpose is that it's compact relative to it's gear-carrying ability.  It's about the same size as a Jeep Wrangler, but can easliy carry 50% more gear inside than a comparably set-up Jeep (comparably meaning no rear seat).

The axle articulation on this truck is fantastic, and the four wheel drive system is strong and simple. 

The final negative I'll bring up is that accessories for Land Rovers tend to cost more than their equivalents for Jeeps.

So who should buy this vehicle? 
In my opinion the lack of amenities, the noise, and the other rustic characteristics make it a poor choice for an owner who doesn't have uses which take full advantage of the off-road prowess of this remarkable vehicle.  But if you have the need for a true trail rig that will suffice for day to day driving, this is your machine.  Think about it this way, most &quot;SUV&quot;s are cars that compromise a little on-road performance to generate a little off-road performance.  The D90 is an off-road vehicle that sacrifices a little off-road performance for a little on-road performance.
