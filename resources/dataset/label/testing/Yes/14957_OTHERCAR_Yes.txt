            We started looking for a digital camera to share pictures on the net. We looked at various models, but finally decided on this model due to the ease of use. The best feature is that is uses a regular floppy disc, no need to worry about those fancy little discs that must be converted on your hard drive. Another great feature is the screen on the back, giving you the ability to watch fast moving kids while trying to catch their cute little faces. The screen also allows you to view the pictures you have taken. 

It has a zoom lens, built in flash, a battery that can take up to 2000 shots as well as a charger to recharge the battery. It also has a special effects feature to make your photos take on a new look, including black and white or sepia. It is so easy to use, anyone can take great pictures. And do you have out of town relatives? Just shoot and click, remove the disc and send those pictures. A great way to keep far away loved ones and friends up to date on what happening at your house.

They only drawback is the size, It is not small and is a hard fit in your purse unless you carry a big bag.<br><br>
