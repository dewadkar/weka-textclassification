            I own a 2000 Dodge Neon and couldn't be happier.  It gets great gas mileage, smooth ride, and best of all, it's inexpensive!!!  I spent a lot of time researching different makes and models but if I had it to do all over again I would go right to the Dodge Neon dealership.  There is a lot of room in the front, as well as the back seat.  This car comes highly recommended by a very satisfied Dodge Neon car owner. It is not a very expensive car and it would be good for a teenager or a retired old man or woman.  I whole heartedly recommend this car.  Take my advice......It is great!!!!!!<br><br>
