            When I first started looking at cars to buy, I wanted a four-door sedan. I looked at the Nissan Altima, and the Hondas. But I wanted a bigger car then the Nissan and a V6.  I went to the Chevrolet dealership and looked at the Malibu. I loved the car the minute I got in it.
One aspect I love about the Malibu is its American heritage.  The Malibu LS is only around $18,000 which is a great deal for what you get!  The standard features are great and the controls are in great locations.  I like the big-car ride, and the powerful V6.  The engine is plenty powerful for this car and the transmission is always keeping the engine's rpm is its power band.  The mechanics on the car seem to be quite good.  The seating is great for 4 and good for 5 people.  I found the seats to be more then comfortable on a 4 hour road trip.  There isn't really anything I hate about the car but I do have some dislikes.  For one I have had to bring it into the dealer because my driver's side window track broke, the glove box rattled, and the driver's door control panel came loose.  Other then that I have on complaints.
The car is very fun to drive. The V6 gives the car great off-the-line acceleration and getting onto the highway isn't any trouble. The ride is like an Old's 88 or a large American car ride.  The suspension is firm and holds the road wonderful yet absorbs most of the unpleasant bumps.  The handling is very precise and the cornering is fairly good. We have a 98 Nissan Maxima in the family and the Maxima isn't that much more fun to drive then the Malibu.
Who should buy is vehicle is a good question. I'm 18 years old and I love the Malibu.  I feel the Malibu is great for every person.
