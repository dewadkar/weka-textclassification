            In the summer of 1996, my father and I purchased a brand new 1996 Plymouth Neon. It was a beautiful Strawberry Red Color. We loved it. We had our previous car for almost 12 years and it was time for a new one. Unfortunately, our beautiful new car was in an accident. It was fixed up, but after that it was never the same.

However, our problems with this car started before the accident. Over the past 4 years we have had several issues. The first involves the brakes. My father and I have had to take the car in several times because the brakes would squeal. Luckily, the car was under warranty, and the problem was fixed. However, they are now squealing again, and the car is no longer under warranty.

Another problem we are having is with the power system. We have power doors standard, and one of the rear doors does not work, and the front passenger does not work. We paid to have this fix about two months, and they have started to falter again in the last two weeks. Unrelated to the power issue, the front driver door, does not open all of the time with the key. My dad has to put WD-40 sometimes so the door will continue to work.

Our radiator went out back in May, and it took our motor with it. That cost almost a 1,000 dollars to fix, but now it works fine. Other than that, the car is wonderful. Gas mileage is great. Sometimes we can make it from our home in Phoenix to Las Vegas which is 300 miles away on one gas tank. We have not had problems with the cooling system or electrical other than the power doors. It rides wonderfully. 

If you wish to buy a used 96 Neon, I would look under the hood, check the brakes, and ask about the power system, but all in all I would recommend this car.<br><br>
