            I have owned two saturns.  The first was an SL1 that I bought in California.  I found the salesperson to be truely helpful and the car drove like a dream.  I bought the car used so I wasn't able to add a whole lot of bells and wistles to it, but I had no reason to complain about the car for all of the 40,000 miles I put on it in just over a year.  When I traded this car in I had no question in my mind that I would get another Saturn.  I ended up with a used SL2 this time.  It has a few more amenities than the first car.  I love it!  Both of my Saturns drive and ride a lot better than other cars I have owned.  
I plan to always buy Saturns unless I see a reason not to own one.  I like them because of the way the drive.  I also feel safe in my Saturn.  They are designed to crumple on impact which is safer for you in the vehicle.  I once had a minor fender-bender with my SL2.  I accidentally rear-ended someone and the front of the car did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I was annoyed at the time with the expense and the hassle of getting the front end fixed, but what I realized was that had the accident been more serious, I would have been safer because my car took most of the impact.
The other thing I like about Saturns is how much room they have.  I am never cramped in my Saturn.  Also, if I have a larger load to carry, I can lower both back seats and have a lot more extra trunk space.  The trunk is huge anyway.  Also, I like the apolstry choices that Saturn gives you.  None of them is so dark (unless you choose black leather) that it soaks up sun and burns you when you sit down. Most of the cloth apolstry is a neutral color.  Unfortunately, the dashboard is usually a dark color and tends to get very hot in the sun.
The only thing I personally don't like about the Saturn is the way they make their steering wheels.  They have large bumps at either side of the wheel.  I think they are meant to be hand grips, but they are honestly too big for my hands.  Also, the steering wheel is too smooth.  It has no real grip to it.  I always get some kind of wheel cover to improve my grip on the wheel.<br><br>
