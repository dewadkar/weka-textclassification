            I purchased this Canon S-10 as a last minutes decision from a local Office Max store when they were closing out this model at a bargain price.
I also bought the IBM 340 microdrive. I took this camera to Beijing and Hong Kong and I took 720 pictures in various different resolution. The camera's pictures are great even in a low light environment. The only complain that I have on this camera is that the flash is too bright and it blinded some of my family and friends.  The USB connection is fast and effective.  But I liken the software that come with my Epson Printer 880 called Film factory that give it the best use by displaying all my pictures as a screen saver on my PC!  I printed a couple of pictures on the matt black paper and the quality of this 1.2 mega pixel rival some of the best picture of my other SLR pictures. The only suggestion I would recommended will be buying the Power Supply Kit with an extra rechargable battery. However, you can turn off the LCD display in the back to save battery. Anyway, who need to preview it every single shot when you are sure it is going to come out right most of the time.  The beauty of the S-10 is its truly compact size.  I bought the camera with the microdrive and power supply kit and extra rechargable battery for under $600.  Go get your Powershot S-10 ASAP because it is phasing out and Canon will push for the Canon S-100.  <br><br>
