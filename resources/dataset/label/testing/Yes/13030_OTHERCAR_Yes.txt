            The thought of purchasing a Volvo never entered my mind.  I was never one for the &quot;boxy&quot; look that the Volvo was notorious for.  My opinions of Volvo's have greatly changed after test driving a Volvo, and than purchasing one.
During my test drive of the Volvo, I picked up on many safety features that can come with the Volvo S80.  I absolutely adored the way the Volvo hugged the road, though it is not a sports car, it sure fooled me into believing it was.  The cars traction was amazing, and it was the most smoothest ride that I was ever on.
The appearance of the car is a vast improvement from the original look.  It is sleeker, and has more of a 21st century appearance rather that a 80's appearance.  The interior of the car is gorgeous.  It's exactly what you would expect from a luxury vehicle and more.
I believe that this car is suitable for people of all ages.  Though the price of the S80 is in fact a little steep, I believe that it is worth it.  One feels security, and pleasure while driving the Volvo S80<br><br>
