            Although I do not own this particular vehicle, I have had the opportunity to drive the Durango, plenty of times. I found that the Durango is a very good 4x4 vehicle, as it took me up the fire breaks at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base in southern California. The Durango only had a problem when the hard ground gave way to thick dust, that just about reached the bottom of the door, coupled with the fact that the fire break began a very steep incline. Durango has a lot of cargo room, at first seems somewhat small but this is deceiving and to my surprise it's very spacious.
 The group I was with in California found that we could pack more equipment in the Durango than in another suv by a significant amount. In fact we hauled over 15 bags, 50 pounds each, of concrete, all the hand tools for digging holes (post hole digger, breaking bar, etc..), thirty 1/2&quot;x18&quot; rebar,  and our surveying equipment, with no problems or loss of power. The gear was also easily, and readily accessible.
 The power of this truck is never an issue, with it's 306 cu. in. power plant, the Durango has plenty of get up and go. And with three engines to choose from, the 306 is the &quot;mid&quot; sized engine, you can pick your power needs. 
If you are considering to buy a suv then look no further than a Durango, and that is if you are looking for a vehicle that can take you just about anywhere you want or need go, and looks good clean or dirty. You may consider another vehicle though if you are looking for a convertible, they don't make them, yet!!<br><br>
