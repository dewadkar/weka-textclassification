            Here is another example of my husband's obsession with Nissans.  But once again, I have no complaints about it.  

This is a fast 4 cylinder car (other than the Neon), that saves money in your pocketbook.  It saves on gas and it is really stylish for such a low price tag.  From it's sleek body to it's easy to add-on dash, this car has a lot of positives about it.  

A good thing about this car is the handling, which is a smooth, carefree ride all the way from start to destination finish.  Also, the quiet engine and top-notch acceleration makes you feel like your in a 6 cylinder car.<br><br>
