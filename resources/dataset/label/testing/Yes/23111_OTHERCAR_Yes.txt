            After the un-timely end of my previous ride (accident) I decided to stay loyal to Dodge.  I looked around for about two weeks before picking a brand new and all shiny 1998 Platinum Stratus.  

I loved this car when I saw it, I loved it more after I drove it, and two years later I still love it!

Q: How much interior space does this car have?
A: Lots. I'm a fairly large guy and I don't have a problem getting or out of the car and the back seat is huge.  Three Average size adults can easily fit in the back of it.  

Q: How about the trunk space?
A: Perfect place to store the in-laws.  Seriously, the thing is huge.  It easily fits three large grocery bags and all my car-care items and tools and oil, etc.  Somewhere around 20 cubic feet of space.

Q: How about Maintenance
A: Just the Oil changed every 3000 miles.  Never Had any un-scheduled maintenance on it and I've averaged about 15,000 miles a year.

Q: How about performance and Gas Mileage?
A: Okay, performance wise it's not too bad, not too good.  The car is very heavy for its size (sub 20,000 and offically a mid-size) and price range (3000 lbs. +) so while the large 2.4L 4-Cyl Engine manages to handle hills and A/C without any trouble, don't expect to set any land speed records.  Gas mileage wise, I've got to say I'm rather happy--even with the A/C on full blast in the summer I still get about 22mpg in the city and 29mpg on the highway.  

Q: What Features does it have?
A: Power windows and locks all around and a CD/Stereo System that kicks tushy and takes names! I'm serious, this car has the best stock stereo system that I've ever heard.  Better than Buick, Better than Lexus and way better than anything it its price range.  It handles bass and mid-range extremely well and always sounds full and natural.

Q: What about the ride and comfort?
A: The ride is superb.  I have to say it rivals a low-end Lexus.  Maybe a High-end Buick or Pontiac.  The Road does feel a little rough through the steering wheel and the highway noise is a bit high, but I think you've got to expect some missing features for fewer dollar signs.  You will find nothing in the sub 20,000 range that rides near this well.

Q: Is there anything you don't like about this car?
A: Yes, the set belts get stuck constantly.  They roll-over on themselves and generally get tangled up and tick me off.  Nothing like trying to untangle the seat-belt for five minutes straight.  And it drives like a speed-boat on wet roads.  Hydro-planes like nobody's business.  It doesn't do very well on snow, though I suspect a different tread on the tires would help a lot.  It's also a bit low to the ground for my tastes.  And the drink holders are too close to the center console.  Large drinks from places like McDonalds don't fit too well.  <br><br>
