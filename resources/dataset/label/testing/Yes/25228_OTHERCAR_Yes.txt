            I bought a Dodge Ram 2500 XLT with the 360 V-8 (2WD) about 3 years ago, used. It had 70,000 miles on it. Normally I would never buy a vehicle with so many miles on it, but I knew the previous owner. He hauled long sheets of glass for his custom glass company that he owned. Obviously the truck had never been beat on; driving like a maniac with several hundred pounds of glass on the bed isn't the wisest thing to do..lol.

Overall, this was a very solid truck. The interior was roomy, and nicely laid out. The HUGE center console was my favorite part about the interior. I stuffed everything short of additional passengers in that thing. 

Mechanically, the truck ran beautiful. I found the ride to be almost car-like as far as handling the bumps on the road. It ran very smooth, even at speeds in excess of 80mph (got to test out the 360 V-8 somehow :)) I also found the turning radius to be much shorter than other full-sized trucks I had test drove. I had a friend convert the exhaust to a stainless steel dual exhaust, so this thing was loaded with horsepower.

My biggest complaint was the gas mileage, but then again, anyone who gets a 3/4 ton truck with a 360 V-8 should not expect great gas mileage in the first place. I have to admit that my ignorance got the best of me, and so I did underestimate just how costly this truck was on gas. I was commuting 30 miles to work one way, so eventually the price of filling this truck caught up to me, and so I traded it in on a vehicle that got better gas mileage. If I had lived closer to work, I never would have gotten rid of it.

The resale value for my truck was awful, and I don't attribute it to the high mileage. At the time I traded the Ram in, the truck market was absolutely flooded with Dodge Rams. I don't know how the newer models are fairing in trade-in value, so I can only speak for my 94 SLT. If you are looking to buy a Ram, whether it be new or used, the best advice I can give is try to get an extended cab and four-wheeled drive, if budget permits. I think you will take a smaller loss when it is time to trade it in.

Normally, I would tell people to avoid Chrysler products like the plague, however I honestly cannot denounce the 94 Dodge Ram 2500. The truck was great for me, so it would be unfair of me to fault it for being a Chrysler vehicle.

I will not divulge any more information about why I don't like Chrysler vehicles in this review, because I don't believe people come here to hear babble about someones gripes with a particular automobile company, but come here to read opinions on a specific product of that company. I want to email me and ask, fine, please do so. I would be happy to give you more information about why I dislike Chrysler. I did not know the particular information that I know now about Chrysler when I bought my Ram, which may be a good thing, because I would have never bought that otherwise excellent truck.<br><br>
