            I own a 98 Kia Sephia LS.  It has only been to the shop for routine work, such as an oil change and tune-up, and I have yet to have a problem with it.  I have also noticed that the value of the car has not depreciated much since I bought it.  It is still worth only a few hundred less than what I paid.

The customer service at the dealership was excellent.  The people that took care of me went above and beyond what should have normally been expected of a salesperson.  They made sure I was happy, and they did not stop until I found a car that I was happy with and my payments were where I wanted them to be.

The car itself is a nice car.  It drives good (sometimes it does shift pretty harsh) and is very comfortable.  All of the controls like the air-conditioner and radio are within easy reach, however the radio controls are fairly small.  The arm rest doubles as a storage for sunglasses or whatever and has c.d. slots built in for those who need them.  The seating in the car is very roomy, being almost 6', I'm not even cramped, and amazingly, I don't have to have the seat slid all the way back.  The seats have many adjustments so that a person can find the most comfortable position that suits him or her.  The glove box is a good size so you're not cramming everything in, and the trunk is also pretty big with fold down passenger seats for extra room if needed.  There are also standard driver and passenger airbags.  Kia's come in a wide variety of colors as well, both interior and exterior.

When I test drove the base model, it shifted too hard, and you didn't get very many extras, but for a base price of $6,000 it wasn't bad.  I would recommend the base model to someone who has little money but needs a decent car, especially college students, or single parents.  The LS, which doesn't cost an arm and a leg more, I would highly recommend to anyone, it was recommended to me by a friend who owned a Kia- I'm glad I listened.  Kia's are definitely worth the money, and then some.<br><br>
