            Though my title may sound way to close to Nissan's own slogan, its true.  I am 6 feet and i fit very well into this car.  The car is very nimble and well designed.  My girlfriend has a 1989 Sentra and its very easy to say its a totally different car. Even though the '89 Sentra has never had any real problems except for the usual maintence issues on a car of such an age.  As with all Nissan's in my experience they have included a stereo more powerful then their competitors.  One of the first facts the salesman seem to brag about.  The price on this car is 12,865, well that is what i got the sales manager down to.  The invoice on this car is 12,765. This is with standard manual windows, seats etc.  Needless to mention this is a very good price considering this cars features.  The interior for the model I sat in was kind of ugly however I've seen different models with much better looking/feeling interior.<br><br>
