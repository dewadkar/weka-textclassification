            My dad just purchased a used 1995 Jaguar Vanden Plas for $32,000 with 35,000 miles on it. It is comfortable, powerful, stylish, and good looking. We had leased a 1994 XJ6, and the difference was amazing. It hasn't been to the shop yet. Its massive 4.0 liter V6 could easily be mistaken for a V8, for it has great torque and acceleration. The 1994 on the other hand, had to be powershifted just to get decent acceleration. It was a great improvement for Jaguar over a single year. The interior of the Vanden Plas is Connolly leather with sheepsfur floormats. A good Harmon Kardon stereo system comes standard with the Vanden Plas as well.<br><br>
