            Every morning when I go out to the garage I smile - I look at my new Aztek and think &quot;Did I really get this car? Did a car-maker try something this bold?&quot; And then when I turn it on and hit the streets, I am reminded of the best thing about the Aztek - it's the ride. Forget all the discussion you hear about the &quot;polarization affect&quot; (you either like it or hate it), this car drives like a luxury car. I've never owned a car which rode, accelerated and braked so smoothly. The inside is extremely comfortable and the ergonomics are incredible. There are also a ton of great features, such as the lights dimming after you get out of the car (luxury) and the radio volume increasing as your speed does. I personally like the looks. I was tired of being among the legions who own those &quot;box&quot; SUVs - the Aztek breaks that mold and is paving the way for car makers to create more unique vehicles for the new millenium. No real negatives, although the line you see through the rear view mirror (the rear window is split by a line) takes a week or so to get used to (and there is no rear wiper), but when you open that rear tailgate it reveals a cavernous inside (you can fit a 4x8 piece of plywood when the back seats are removed). I wasn't prepared for all the looks I've gotten while driving - everyone is trying to figure out what this car is as it is so unique looking. I'm really happy I got the car - when I first saw it I wasn't on the market to buy a new vehicle (my other SUV was only 1.5 years old), but the Aztek got me. After seeing it for the first time, I started doing research and really got into the concept. Life's about change - the Aztek signals that car-makers can change for the better.<br><br>
