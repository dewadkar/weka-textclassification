            I work for an auto dealer and we were thinking of making a different type of sales proposal sheet for the customer. The general manager thought we should take a picture of each car and list all the options underneath it. When a customer is interested in a vehicle, we give them one of the sheets to take home and think about. If you can look at a potential car and dream about it, chances are - you'll end up owning it!
As they say &quot; A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. That rings true for this camera. It's easy to use and takes great pictures. The battery charges up quickly and lasts for hours. It may still be a little expensive for the average person to buy, but think of the money saved on film. It uses floppy's, which can be erased and used over and over.
All in all, I think this was a great purchase and would recommend it to anyone. It has certainly paid for itself where I work.
The homeowner could  use this to take pictures for insurance purposes and then just store the floppys instead of a stack of pictures. This camera has different options also. Black and white, sepia, color, etc. Just a fun item to use.<br><br>
