            In 1996 my husband and I decided to buy a new vehicle.  We chose the Plymouth Voyager SE.  We enjoyed the versatile of 
removing the seats,  having ample room for our 3 children, and the smooth ride.  After roughly a year we started have some 
problems with the van.  Our first indication that everything was not as it should be was when we got a flat tire.  I hit a pot 
hole in the high speed lane.....ouch what a noise. I managed to pull off to an exit to assess the damage only to find the rim 
was dented and air was quickly leaking out.  My husband got out and assembled the jack that was supplied with the vehicle.  
Lets just say it was rather cheesy.  He jacked up the van and was about to get to work when the jack tilted and the van 
came down hard.  Thank god he wasn't in the way.  Now just to let you know my husband has worked on vehicles for much 
of his life and is not new to changing tires.  We called the roadside assistance that was provided with the van........that was 
exceptional service I must say.   

Over the next year we had had motor mount problems, shocks had to be replaced, (no I did not make a habit out of hitting 
pot holes)We also had problems with the electric door locks.  Some days it would work other days the electric locks would 
go on their on free will. That was fixed all we had to pay for was our 50 deductible.  Next we couldn't use the fan, heat, or 
air any setting besides high.  That got old fast, we were constantly turning it on and off just to regulate the temp in the van.  
My husband ended up just buying the parts because by this point we had had the van in and out of the garage a lot.

This past year the motor mounts went again.  The van would make a rattling noise over every bump.  The performance just 
wasn't that great. We have paid many deductibles these past 4 years.  Also did I mention over the past year there have been 
numerous recalls?

We this past march we decided to trade our old van in for a Plymouth Voyager SE 2000.  Yes we are giving it one more 
try.  Things have improved and they did throw in a roof rack, a cd player and tinted windows at no extra cost.  So far we 
are in love with our new van.  Our dealership is great and sales person is right there for any difficulties we might have.
