            My family purchased this vehicle because we had three children and were on a strict budget.  This economical van provides safety, comfort, and on-road fun to my family.  It has a quiet running noise, is easy to handle, and operates in any condition.  This vehicle is a charm to drive because of its many standard features and wonderful steering and braking systems.  I would suggest this vehicle to anyone who wants comfort and affordability for any family.  This little bit of &quot;heaven on earth&quot; is what everyone needs and can still afford.  I would live in my van if I had to!  Daimler Chrysler is very lucky to have such a gem on its product line.<br><br>
