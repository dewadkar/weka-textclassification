            I leased a 2 door Alero in January, 1999. I ordered from the factory to get exactly what I wanted and have been pleased. It is a very precise handling vehicle, holds the road extremely well and rides very smooth. The car is very sporty and comfortable on long distance trips. The seats are firm enough to support your back yet soft enough to feel as if you are sitting in your living room.  Controls are very easy to read and reach.  The trunk is large with extra room available when the back seat is pulled down for a pass through. The price is very affordable and the vehicle comes in 2 and 4 door variations. Its sporty appearance is very well adapted for a younger family and does not overpower a more mature driver.  Unfortunately GM is phasing out the Oldsmobile line due to lack of interest. I will be very sorry to see this line disappear.  I definitely would get another Alero due to the fact I have had no problems, and the vehicle has been great.<br><br>
