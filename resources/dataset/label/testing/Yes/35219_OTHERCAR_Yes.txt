            I bought my '99 black 4-runner(SR5) back in January 1999.  The reason I went for this make is that I knew some other people who swore by their 4-runners, so at the time, I didn't balk at the 30K price tag for the car.  Overall, I have been very satisfied with the performance of the SUV.  It provides a mostly smooth ride, although the suspension is a little tight on bouncy surfaces.

This SUV rides high and narrow, so I feel a little uneasy when turning sharply.  The steering is ultra-responsive, so I have to be careful not to turn too fast.  The brakes and acceleration are great; I was quite surprised at the pick-up for this type of vehicle.  The 6-cyl. engine definitely gives quite a bit of bang for the buck.

I have 2 toddlers, so there is ample space for their car seats in the backseat.  Unfortunately, we now never use the full cargo space with the back seats folded down.  And when the back seats are up, there is less cargo space than other SUV's.

The gas mileage is ok, I think it's 18MPG on the highway.  What can you do, it's an SUV!!

Overall, I am happy with my purchase.  The SUV has not as of yet given me any mechanical problems.  Whether or not this trend will last remains to be seen.

Do I regret paying so much for an SUV?  Sometimes.  But I feel good that I have a top-performing vehicle that isn't going to crap out on me anytime soon!
