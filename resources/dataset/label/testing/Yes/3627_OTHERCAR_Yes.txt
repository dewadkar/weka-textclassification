            My husband and I wanted and sporty family type car.  We liked the look of the Grand Am, but the size of the Grand Prix and decided to go with a GT.  We have had the car for about a year and half and it has been in the shop 6 times.  Once for steering and 5 times (4 times with Joseph Pontiac in Fenton and once with a shop in Clarkston,  MI) for the ABS and Traction Control System.  We were told it was multiple code problems.  Maybe the problem was with Joseph and they couldn't fix it, but it is sad when you have a brand new car and it spends more time at the dealership then it does in your driveway.  I would love to complain about Joseph Pontiac and how they deal with you after one of their techs steals your car and trades it for some drugs, but I am suppose to stick with the subject and this has nothing to do with the car.

Besides the problems it is a nice car to drive.  Very roomy and comfortable.  I feel in complete control, as long as the ABS and traction control works.  

This is a great car if you have a small family and you don't want to drive a typical looking family car.  It beats a mini-van any day.<br><br>
