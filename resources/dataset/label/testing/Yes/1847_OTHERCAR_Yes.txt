            I love this car, if I could only depend on it!  I purchased it used about 4 years ago, at a very good price because it had some minor hail damage.  I have the V6 4 door with automatic transmission.  It is supposed to have automatic overdrive, but I've never really been able to hear it drop into that 5th gear.  The RPM's will move down a little, so I guess it is going into overdrive, but it is very hard to tell.  The engine is loud, and the road noise is very loud.

I have a power moonroof that I am very happy with, came in handy with my coolent started to leak and now my air doesn't work, if I didn't have the moonroof I don't think I'd be able to drive it at all.  There is a screen over the moonroof window to block the sunlight when needed - but mine busted off the track soon after I purchased.  

My biggest problem has been with the alternator.  The first one broke with in weeks of purchasing.  The second one about a month later, when I tried to get the service station to cover it they said they wouldn't because it could be the battery - so I got a new one of those.  The third one went out on me about a year ago, this time I replaced the alternator and battery at the same time and (keep your fingers crossed) the fourth one has lasted me two years now!  

Trunk light went out long ago, passanger door lock doesn't work, there is no ashtry, the cigerette lighter will sometimes fly out at you and under your seat where it disappears for weeks at a time.  The breaks have been completely replaced twice.  I had new tires with deep threads to help with driving in rain, the original ones were terrible.  Manual window cranks are a strain.  

My latest repair was a cluncking noise whenever I stopped or went over bumps, the mechanic called it the "Lower arm control".  He said they are made out of plastic and usually bread within a few years, I should be expecting my driver's side one to go out on me anytime, and at $350 a pop, that wasn't what I wanted to hear.  He said the american cars are made with these plasic parts that do not last - they do at least 2 a week there.  He believes the american car industry is in collaboration with the parts industry to keep the vechicles in need of repairs???

What I do like about it is the comfortable seats, easy to use cruise control, and I love the interior lights... mostly the map lights.  I like the daytime running lamps, as well as head lamps that automatically go on with light sensors.  I used to always leave my head lights on, no longer a problem with this car.  I like that it's american that it is easy to have worked on.  My previous car was a honda civic - not many problems with it, but when there were the parts were more expensive, and the labor would always be through the roof because everything was located under the engine.  It is much more affordable to keep up with the maintence on this car.  

My dad has always drove pontiac's and they have always performed well for him, they key he says, "Get your oil changed every 3 months or every 3,000 miles, no matter what".  Overall, the maintence on a used car is going to be needed, but still much cheaper than purchasing a new car.
