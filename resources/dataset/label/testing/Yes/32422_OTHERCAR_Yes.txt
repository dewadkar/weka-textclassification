            This would be the second Civic that I have owned and it's due to the fact that these are the best built cars for the money.  Honda seems to take great pride in designing a well-made car that everyone can afford.  I chose the EX trim level (as opposed to the lower DX and HX trim levels) because of the better performance and what seemed to be a better value when the amount of standard equipment is added in.  For the record, Honda makes an Si version of the Civic which provides stellar performance but I didn't think that it was worth the extra $3000 in price (not to mention the insurance hike).

On top of what you would expect from a Civic like excellent gas mileage  the EX came standard with A/C, power windows, locks, cruise control, moonroof and keyless entry.  New for '99 was a standard CD player in the dash (before it was an add-on option that resided practically on the floor) and relocated climate controls that allow better access to the radio. 

The interior of the Civic is a very hospitable place.  The seats are supportive and given that it is a two-door coupe, the rear seat can handle adults with relative comfort.  The dashboard is clean and all controls are placed within easy reach.  Surprising plus (to me at least) was the large trunk and rear 60/40 fold-down seat that is lockable.

The Civic isn't all roses though.  Even though it makes a good amount of power you really need to rev the stink out of it to make it go.  Although this is quite fun it also kills your gas mileage and people tend to give you looks as you go screaming away from a stoplight.  Another downside to this &quot;peaky' engine is that if you opt for the auto shifter it tends to feel sluggish.

The A/C is pretty inadequate when it comes to cooling down the car in 90+ degree weather.  With all the thoughtful planning that went into this car it is very surprising that this would be executed so poorly.

All in all, the Civic is an excellent car that offers a bit of class and refinement on a working stiff's income.  A plus for those who like to personalize your vehicle, the Civic has one of the largest aftermarket equipment selections available.<br><br>
