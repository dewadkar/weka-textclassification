            i was very surprised when i read other opinions about this little car.
i purchased a G20 in 1996. it was a 1996 model, 4 cylinder, all leather, sunroof, cd, auto everything. it only had 600 miles on it.
i was very impressed when i test drove it. it appeared to be a sporty and classy car filled with all the extras.
however, i finally junked it 6 months ago. the hood and the trunk had been repainted prior to my purchase of it. it had been in an accident prior to purchase. the salesman never told me about these things). 
i had purchased an extended warranty, bumper to bumper for a lot of money.
the dealer refused to repair the paint job.
1 year after the purchase, my starter went. when i called infiniti to find out if that was covered they said no. i had to pay $800 out of my own pocket to replace it. (i later found out, that it should have been covered under the warranty).
the car never could make it up hills more than 20 mph. it had several rattles in it that could not be detected by the infiniti mechanics. note: it had visited many different mechanic shops in the 3 short years i owned it.
it pulled to one side sharply, and had a bad vibration. i went thru three sets of tires, because they would wear unevenly.
infiniti refused to deal with these problems.
the silver lining on the outside door handles all peeled off. infiniti refused to repair them.
the antenna broke in the first week of my purchase. it was a withdraw antenna. again, infinti refused repair.
the sunroof became stuck in the open position, i was driving around with plastic on it to keep out the weather. nothing from infiniti.

i paid quite a bit for the car, $500 a month. the dealer totally ripped me off with all his lies. ( i later found out he was arrested for stealing from the dealership he worked in, and for punching out a customer.)
in my recommendation, i would hardly recommend this car to anyone. that is if you want to stay out of the mechanic shops and keep the money in your own pockets.
