I purchased a 1998 Kia sportage. I bought it because it was affordable and it has the same features as the high priced SUV's. The Kia rides wonderful for a 4 cylinder engine and at high speeds is very smooth running. My Kia had break dust on the front hub caps due to the metallic break. I contacted the Kia Headquarters and they gave me new break pads at no charge and had my dealer put them on. They were a pleasure to deal with. This was the only problem I experienced with the Kia. Those who should buy this vehicle is anyone who enjoys a sporty looking SUV without the high sticker price. If you love driving a vehicle that handles well in all weather conditions then this is the one for you. Don't forget the ample space inside, more than enough for those are single and just right for those with a family.
