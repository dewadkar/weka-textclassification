            -Introduction:
I was sick of it all.  Walking around with a big bulky Sony Mavica with "okay" quality pictures, and slow disks speeds.  It just wasn't cutting it, so I just threw the digital camera away in the trash.  Oh well, It's not mine.  As a highschool student, working at a small computer company, I decided that I would only budget around $1,000 dollars to spend on a digital camera and it's accessories.  I began the quest with reading magazines, online reviews, word of mouth, discussions, because I'm not going to waste MY money and I certainly don't want you to waste YOUR money, except if your'e going to buy me a present.. (My Birthday is Feb 19th and I like Black Ferrari's).  After A week of investigating I made my decision, the Sony F505V Digital Camera.

-Why did I choose it?
I really wanted something that was light and portable.  I am also not a big fan of the bulky Mavica digital cameras.  I also wanted good image quality and more importantly a good "zoom" for the money.  I read the reviews and information that stated it's most stated CONS: [battery] + [included memory stick] + [2.6 megapixels instead of 3.3] + [No Optical Viewfinder].  Though I shot down each CON because:  [The battery life of this camera is pretty good (90 mins of picture taking), and other cameras have horrible battery life as well and they don't include a battery] + [8mb memory stick?, my friend's kodak dig.camera got that size too.  That really sucks, they should have atleast provided a 16mb memory stick for the price most customers have paid, though I was already planning to get a 64mb memory stick] + [2.6 megapixels is fine enough for me and most cameras that do have 3.34 or 2.6 are bigger in size] + [I have read reviews that even though its odd not having the viewfinder, they quickly adapted] One of The factors/elements that drove me to buy the F505v, was the Carl Zeiss Lens.  I am not really "up" on the "downlow" of Cameras/Optics, but I knew about the World Reknowned Carl Zeiss.  His German designed lens's are known to produce clear and beautiful images.  I had other choices of cameras [see bottom], but this camera suited me for what I desired.

-24 Hours Of Game Play:
Upon pickup of the package at FEDEX(They were going to drop if off the next day, but I couldn't wait), I quickly opened up the box.  Included inside: SONY F505V Digital Camera, USB Cord, Battery, Battery Charger, Battery Adapter Cord, Video Cord, MGI Software, (2) Straps, 8MB SONY Memory Stick, and a Manual.  I immediately put the battery and memory stick inside the digital camera and began to turn it on (I was happy to hear a nice startup sound).  I was also very happy that the battery was already charged, so I was playing with it inside my car outside of FEDEX.  The 'thing' about Sony's Digital Camera's is: They are so easy to use, that a user will fly through the setup commands.  Though after taking two pictures I decided it was time for me to drive home so I could play with it more.
Within the first couple hours, I was already churning out photos like a pro (it's easy) and taking photos of my monkey (stuffed animal).  As I hooked up the USB cord to the camera, it asked to install the drivers, which I did (took seconds).  Then after it was very pleasing just to see a virtual drive on "My Computer".  I could just copy and paste it into my computer!  The USB speed rates were acceptable, better than the speeds of the old floppy disks.  One thing I noticed about the battery charger was that when you want to power the Camera (AC, through the battery charger), the battery does not charge, you are only allowed to Charge the battery or Power the Camera.  Oh well, it wasn't quite a big deal to me.  Another thing was that it was 'odd' at first without having the viewfinder.  Though I quickly adapted to the situation.  I also love the "hidden" flash (High,Normal,Low) which produced a very good amount of light.  At normal flash mode I was stunned at how bright the picture looked in a pitch black room.  The features (Sepia,Solarize,B&W,Negative) weren't really exciting to me, because no new features were added.

-Weeks Use:
I really got use to the "no viewfinder" idea and love the swivel feature of the camera.  I can easilly use all the features, though I wish more features were added.  (The first hour I was already done playing with ALL the features).  Another thing I 'disliked' about the camera, was that you can't choose different compression standards and you can only change Resolution of the pictures.  The Movie mode was a joke to me, because I don't really need it, though for testing I made a couple movies.  I decided to turn off the "digital zoom" feature, because it decreased the quality of the image once it used it.  Nothing new or interesting to comment on, except that: "lets just say that the movie mode wasn't my major incentive on buying this camera".  When I took this out to go with my friends around town, they were really impressed with the camera and wished they could get one too (Two friends have KODAK digital camera and one has an Mavica).  The appearance was what stunned them the most.  My friends began to drool at the size of the lens and the design of the camera.  I guess it's true how your friends admire the guy with the 'biggest' er....lens.....

Conclusion:
I really like this camera, and if I could go back in time, seconds before I bought it, I still wouldn't change my mind about it.  The CONS didn't become an issue to me anymore, and the 2.6 (not 3.3) megapixel deal didn't frighten me either.  I quickly adapted and love this new camera and recommend it to those who feel they can bypass the CONS for the PRO's.  At the price I paid for it: $703.00, it was a good one (www.buydig.com).
