            We purchased our Expedition after test driving both the Expedition and the Explorer.  We are young with a growing family, so cabin space was very important to us.  The Expedition had much more cabin space, with the ability to put three car seats across in the middle seat.  With the Explorer, only one car seat would fit comfortably in the middle of the seat.  We are very pleased that we purchased the Expedition which gives us ample room for traveling to haul all the extras.  It also has a third seat which is nice when there are more than 5 passenger. It has a very nice ride and is very comfortable to ride in.  The only draw back is the high cost of fueling the gas tank.  If you have 2 or more kids and are looking for a sports utility vehicle I definitely recommend the Ford Expedition.<br><br>
