                 Me being a second-hand car dealer, I get to drive a lot of cars. I recently purchased a Chevrolet Corvette and hope to sell it for around 30-40K.
     For someone like me this is the perfect car, with extremely sharp on narrow, windy country roads, and an acceleration of 0-60 mph in just 4.7 seconds, I immediately fell in love.
     This car is a big rival to Ferraris and I thought it is a bargain for 30K (used price) and is definitely in the super car league. Not surprisingly really considering itï¿½s V8 engine and 344 brake horse power.
     My particular model (the coupe) came with the standard kit, which includes twin air bags, ABS, and traction control plus a few extras including electric windows.
     The thing that worries me a bit about this car is the fact that that it has an immobiliser but no alarm! I have to make sure that it is locked, as there is no way of letting me know if it is being stolen.
     The interior in this car is nice looking, but when you sit in it the ride is a bit hard. The hood on mine is easy to operate and mine has pop-out targa panels.
     Overall this is Wheely Good Fun!
