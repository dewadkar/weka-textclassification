            I went to the LA auto show 3 days after purchasing my Silver 2000 GLS, VR6, Auto with the leather and luxury package.  After sitting in numerous cars and trucks (all makes and models) I feel better about my purchase more now than ever.  Other than the other German cars (BMW &amp; Audi), the look and feel of the interiors couldn't even come close to the new Jetta.  The leather in the VW is of such good quality and the dash is very well thought out.  This is not your older brother's Jetta.  The VR6 Automatic is so smooth and quite it only accents the wonderful Monsoon stereo system.  
Before I purchased this car it would always get my attention when I saw one on the road, but I know now that its getting most people's attention because of all the looks and stares my car gets.
