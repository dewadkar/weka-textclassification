               Well, there's the Cherokee. Fixed in everyone's mind. The unchanged, unspoiled soul of the American SUV. It has been around for more than twenty years, and will probably be around for years to come. An American fixture... dare I say icon? Well, it definitely takes some getting used to...
   I've had a 1992 Jeep Cherokee for about three years now. The truck is a light "Hunter Green," in Laredo trim, with a gray cloth interior and several options. I originally bought the car with 37,000 miles on it, from a good owner, and well, the jury's still out as to whether or not it was a wise decision.
   Sure, the Jeep has its ups. Aside from being the roots from which all SUV's sprouted, the twenty-year old SUV is still holding on as strong as it did in its youth. My Laredo, equipped with the 4.0Liter V6, produces 200hp, and plenty of power from a stand-still. The car feels solid, structurally, and the ride is just firm enough to have "feeling," without sacrificing in ride quality.
   The exterior, though dated, retains its tasteful looks even today, and the Laredo package helps that, adding pretty two-tone paint, chrome mirrors and grill, great-looking five-spoke alloy wheels, and fog-lamps. The interior, though also dated, offers plenty of useful space for small objects up front, and plenty for larger objects in back, too. The rear seat folds flat, turning the rugged SUV into a utilitarian hauler. The versatility of this vehicle, as a daily driver, hauler, and off-roader (even with my 2WD version) is what makes it such an appealing overall package.
   The details, however, are not the reason. It is my understanding, after owning 2 Jeeps (other was a 1993 Grand Cherokee Laredo... L-E-M-O-N), that the company is still struggling with some quality issues. A number of trivial problems have arisen since buying the truck, and it has become a nuisance to maintain at times. The rear windshield wiper broke... so I had it fixed at the dealer. The price was reasonable for repairs and labor, but soon after, the spray pump to wash the rear window gave out, as well. 
   The left rear window rolls down, but not up, and the driver's side front window only rolls down about 5 inches (a hassle at the drive through window) and rolls up with snail-like speed. The oil plug seems to be a bad fit, because after almost every oil change oil drips constantly to the garage floor. The engine itself, like I said, is good from a stop (some may call the accelerator a little TOO sensitive), but in the higher ranges and at highway speeds it feels winded and overworked. Steering is as numb as your mouth on novicaine and the understeer is so heavy that you can jiggle the wheel three inches in either direction without the car deterring from its course. And well, the wheels are out of alignment, but I guess that's my fault. Oh, my... forgot to tell you... that low end power comes at a price. I get about 11 miles to the gallon.
   The interior, though roomy, is full of annoying points. First is the terrible quality of materials used throughout. The plastic on the dash is cracking in places, being so thin and cheap, and with every bump in the road the entire dash unit erupts with enough jolts and jitters to drive you mad. The center console sways when you rest your elbow on it, and the bucket seats suffer from a serious lack of support. This is the one car where I would actually prefer the backseat (despite lack of legroom) over the cramped, uncomfortable front passenger's spot. What's with the electronics? Well, I'll tell you one thing... my speedometer only works when it feels like it, and there is honestly no telling how many miles are on the car now... the odometer cuts out every now and then, too. The Jensen stereo is decent, but an aftermarket head unit and speakers more capable of handling bass are recommended for you "stereo-philes" out there. What else would I recommend you put in your car? Spare fluids, as they tend to leak, some earmuffs to dull the sound of shaking plastic on bumpy roads, and a roll of duct tape for when your ash tray and other items start to fall out randomly.  
   Don't think I hate this car, because honestly, I don't. The list of bad things may be long.. but it's mostly trivial stuff... call me picky. The truth is that the Cherokee has lasted for so many years because it is a fun, straight-forward, no nonsense vehicle with singular abilities to do many tasks and go many places. I'm not any less satisfied with my Cherokee than I was the day I bought it, as I have learned to grin and bear the consequences of owning an aging American Icon.
