                I recently wanted to purchase a 2001 Honda Prelude.  The base price on the Prelude was $24,000.  The sales man immediately offered me the car for $22,400.  When I told him I only had 20 thousand to spend his manager told me to buy a civic.  Needless to say, I was rather irritated and I left the dealership.  
    A few days later, my mother's 1991 Dodge Dynasty broke down.  I thus went shopping for a used car for my mom.  After shopping for about 5 minutes I laid my eyes on a 1998 Honda Prelude.  I asked my dad to come over and look at the type of car they wouldn't sell me for 20 grand.  My dad (a mechanic) checked out the car and aside from a few minor scratches he did not see a single flaw.  The car had only 18,000 miles on it.  It was virtually new!  
    The salesman offered us the car for $12,900!!  My parents and I were shocked.  Then the salesman told us the car had a SALVAGE HISTORY.  Most people walk away when they hear those words.  Usually, a car is salvaged if it was totaled in an accident. This Prelude however was never in a single accident.  So, what was the salvage history?  
      The car was bought in August of 1998.  It was driven for 17,000 miles for about a year and a half. Then, it was stolen.  After about 1 year the owner received money from the insurance company since the car had not been recovered.  Then, a salvage title was issued on the car.      
      Three months later it was found!  It was missing airbags and a stereo.  The small used car dealer bought the car dirt cheap (and installed new airbags and a stereo) and thus was able to sell it cheap.  He was selling it in a poor neighborhood and when I offered him $10,000 he said he would accept $10,300 cash.  I happily paid him the money, and became the owner of a "like new" Honda Prelude of which the blue book value is over 19 grand.  
      I have had the car for 6 weeks now.  It handles and drives beautifully!  The interior is in absolute perfect condition.  In fact, the car even smells new!  I am a high school student, and with the money I saved on this car I was able to quit my job and enjoy my youth....at least for a while anyway.  
     To sum up, getting a 1998 prelude for $10,000 can only happen in a dream.  For me, it was a dream come true.
