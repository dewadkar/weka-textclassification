            I am sad to say that JEEP, in their infinite wisdom, Has 
decided to stop the production of the CHEROKEE, and opt for the bubbly liberty.
I have long wanted a JEEP CHEROKEE, and decided the 2001 model would be my last chance to own a new one. I love everything about this vehicle, especially the tough looks of it. I still miss the COMANCHE truck,
We traded in a '99 Pontiac Montana for the JEEP. Even without the space of a mini-van, it is still a much more superior vehicle. The comfort of driving is excellent, the power of the I-6 is more than enough. I am truly sorry to see it go.
