            I own a bright red, XE V6 Nissan Xterra.  I just hit 1000 mi. yesterday.  What a great milestone it was getting here.  I had to wait (6 months) and go threw 7 dealers looking for the right price ( $500.00 under MSRP). When I found the Dealer, I had to wait 2 weeks for the vehicle to arrive.  The wait was well worth it.  I had owned a Rodeo 91 before.  I didn't want to give up the room it had; I didn't sacrifice anything.  I gained a new, first model out, eye turning, SUV. My new ride drives smooth.  It turns well and is loaded with options. I recommend the protection package for all new owners. The package runs about $500.00 but is definitely worth it.  It gives you a acrylic/poly coat on the paint, scotch guard on seats and carpet, etched in vin# on all windows, tire warranty, and a replacement cost for deductible for theft. I would recommend this vehicle to my mother. I just love it. <br><br>
