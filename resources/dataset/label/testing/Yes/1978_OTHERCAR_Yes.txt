            I have previously owned a 1997 Nissan Maxima GXE, and a 1992 Maxima before that. I decided to trade in my 97 for a brand new 2000 Maxima. I was hoping to get an experience similar to those of my previous Maximas. Well, I got a lot more than i hoped for! Here's what I found with the 2000 Nissan Maxima GXE:

<b>Price:</b>
Well... The price varies pretty much on the dealer. You can get a GXE (Basic all out model) from the upper $19000s to $21000s. But for what you get with the car, it's very well worth it. The engine DOHC was named a top 10 engine at one point, and the car is filled with great sexy styling. Both on the exterior and interior. ~$20000 for the Nissan Maxima is a great price for such a high quality, and hey! IT'S JAPANESE! The Maximas are built in Japan, Japan has very good cars and high quality parts.

<b>Warranty:</b>
It depends on the dealer and where you buy it. They all offer different things. I got a life-time oil replacement from my dealer, and a 5 year parts&amp;labor warranty.

<b>Styling:</b>
The 2000 Nissan Maxima GXE has great looks. It's very well rounded, and the curves give it a very sleek look. Chrome hubcaps look great on this car, they give it a true sporty and superior look. I also love the lights on this car, they are futuristic looking, and look like those of the Lexus GS300/400s.

<b>Engine:</b>
The engine is a DOHC V-6 190HP!!! That's a whole lot of power for such a car. Along with the Maxima's great fuel injectors, you can accelerate and cruise the road at very high speeds. This is probably the best engine that I have seen on a sedan in the Maxima's price range. 

<b>Acceleration:</b>
When I took my Maxima out onto the open roads in Indiana, I was able to get from 0-60mph in about ~7 seconds (sorry about before with my 10 seconds, I was only estimating. The acceleration was purely incredible on the Nissan Maxima. It can go really fast when you push it. It can really thrill you.

<b>Response Rate:</b>
The Nissan Maxima has a very strong response rate, and will react very smoothly with your controls. It will move abruptly when it's supposed to, and will start to brake as soon as you hit the brake pedal. Steering is easy, and the Nissan Maxima again reacts very smoothly and accordingly with the steering wheel. It's a very responsive car, it wont fail you.

<b>Braking:</b>
The Nissan Maxima can brake very easily. I have never had problems with it stopping before. It doesn't have any problems with stopping on ice or anything, the brakes on the Nissan Maxima are very strong, and they wont wear off for a long time. Stopping is very easy.

<b>Ride:</b>
The Nissan Maxima has great shock absorbers and wont be shaking or anything. You would not feel the road below you or any bumps. I have found the Maxima to have very good suspension, and very easy on you. It's a very comfortable car to simply ride in. It moves across the road very softly and swiftly, you can fall asleep in it.

<b>Suspension:</b>
As I have mentioned before. The shocks are very absorbant, and will make your car run smoother over the road. they are excellent quality shocks. Some of the best that i have seen on a car. the shocks on older Maximas were also great. But the shocks on the 2000/1 Nissan Maxima give you a truly soft and easy ride.

<b>Mileage and Fuel Economy:</b>
I was able to get plenty of miles on this car. It isn't the most efficient car in it's class, but it's really not all that expensive to run. You can make many miles on a full tank of gas. Filling up a full tank with premium gas is around $22. I found the Nissan Maxima to be quite fuel efficient, but not the most efficient in its class though. You can still get a couple hundred miles with a full tank of gas, the highway fuel efficiency is great.

<b>Comfort:</b>
The seats on the Nissan Maxima are quite wide and very comfortable. I could sit in the seats the whole day if I'd want to. They are much softer and fuller than those of the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. The Nissan Maxima is a very comfortable car. There is also plenty of leg room to stretch out your legs. The Nissan Maxima has a roomy and very stylish interior. 

<b>Sound System:</b>
The Nissan Maxima is souped up with a powerful Bose stereo system. The sound and bass is incredibly strong that comes from the speakers. they are located throughout the vehicle, and have a supreme surround sound affect. These are very high quality speakers that will enrich your car with great music and sound.

<b>Interior Styling:</b>
The Nissan Maxima has a fine interior. There are some wood finishes within it, and the speedometer looks great. The interior is great looking, and it feels great to be in the car. Very stylish and well made interior, truly eye candy.

<b>Reliability:</b>
I have had no problems at all with my 2000 Nissan Maxima. It is very reliable. I haven't taken it to the shop for any problems yet... The Nissan Maxima is built very strong, and wont let you down. The Nissan Maxima is one truly solid car.

<b>The Verdict:</b>
The 2000 Nissan Maxima is a great car. It is the best in its class, and it outperforms all competitors in every aspect. It has tremendous strength beneath the hood, and will really impress you with its high agility and performance. The price is unbelievable, starting at $19000! That's great, for everything that you get with the Nissan Maxima. The Nissan Maxima is without any doubt a best buy, and it is truly eye candy that will impress everyone.<br><br>
