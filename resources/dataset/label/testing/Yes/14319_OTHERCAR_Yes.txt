            EXTERIOR: 8
This is a nice-looking little car. We decided to go with the dark gray/silver (sorry, the name escapes me). It looks so classy. I wouldn't recommend some of the other colors that are out now, like the green or purple-they will look dated in a year or two.

INTERIOR: 8
The interior of is great. It is small and a little cramped, but the seats are surprisingly comfortable. Leg room in the back seat is virtually non-existant. The dash has a very clean layout, but can be blocked if cups are placed in the cupholder. There is plenty of storage space, and the trunk is spacious for a compact vehicle.

ENGINE: 8
The engine is small, but powerful enough to climb mountains without feeling like the turtle on the side of the road will pass you.

HANDLING: 7
This little car handles nicely! Tight corners and U-turns are no problem. 

RIDE: 8
The ride is a little loud, one of the prices you pay being so close to the ground in a low-end car. But it handles the road smoothly, with little jarring on potholes.

RELIABILITY: 10
Nissan's are great at reliabililty. Although I've only had the car for a few months, there's been no problems. And don't expect any for a long, long time.

VALUE: 9 
Great gas mileage + cheap little car + above average appointments = GREAT VALUE

THE VERDICT: A GREAT LITTLE CAR
