              This is a good car, but it doesn't quite reach the "great car" designation in my opinion.  The biggest reason in my case have been three fairly significant warranty service calls in the past year: (1) Defective front struts (a huge problem with this model/year according to the Honda technician);  (2) Hydraulic fluid leak;  (3) Failed alternator.  How many cars less than 2 years old have alternators that fail?  
  My guess is that Honda realized if it is going to compete with Hyundai and others in this very competitive market, it needs to figure out how to get its costs down.  In terms of their engineering and materials, they have done a good job.  I think the engine is excellent with both pep and 38 mpg on the highway with 5-speed.  The interior in my opinion is also excellent.  I have an LX (mid-level) which comes with cruise, a decent stereo, power windows, etc.  Not many choices with options, nor should there be because this standardization keeps the factory cranking out cars at a low cost.
   But unlike Toyota, I think Honda has made a decision to lower their component quality.  Build quality (this car was made in Canada) is still quite good.  But bad alternators in a 2-year old Honda, and a whole slew of bad front struts -- that shouldn't be happening.  Maybe they have fixed things for 2002, but look closely at mechanicals if you are buying this year & model used.
   Other comments:  quite good crash test numbers, and this car came with optional side air bags.  Engine noise is noticeable but not unbearable.  Good driver position and controls.  Handling is average -- it is not as tight as some other small sedans.  Only one speed intermittent wipers.  The Firestone 690 tires on this car are about the worst tires in the world.  I replaced them after 25K miles because I vowed to myself not another unsafe winter with these tires!  Backseat is roomier than most compacts, and no transmission hump.  Trunk is nicely sized.
