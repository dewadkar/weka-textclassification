            STRENGTHS:
The car has exceptional power and handles quite well for a car its size. Gas mileage is acceptable at 17/18 in town and nearly 24 when we took it on the highway (50 miles one way)

WEAKNESSES:
A lot of computer enhanced electronics. They make the car ride and drive nicer but I'll worry about their cost if and when they start going out.

SUMMARY:
So far I'm very happy with the automobile. My wife and I were looking at replacing our existing car but only wanted to spend around $6-7,000. Most of what we looked at worried me in their ability to last. With pre-96 Fords you can become members of the 'Transmission of the Month' club rather easily. We currently own a Chevrolet and although the drive train is bullet proof the rest of the car isn't.

If you're looking at justifying buying an older Cadillac however, I don't think you can. They can be expensive to repair, require premimum fuel and can be tempermental. I wanted a Cadillac first and foremost for their luxurious ride and hopefully longevity. I didn't find either with other domestic cars so I'm willing to tolerate some of their shortcomings.

If you are in the market for a used Cadillac, it's important to find one that you know its' history. Both in the way it was drove and how it was maintained since I don't believe these cars abuse well. To me, finding one that has been babied is well worth paying an extra thousand or two over finding a deal. <br><br>
