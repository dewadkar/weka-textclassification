            Having been a &quot;Honda-loyalist&quot; since I first got my license, I was a 'hard sell' on anything different. We've owned our 1999 Saturn SL1 for a little over a year and a half and I can't see myself ever loving another car company as much as Saturn! My husband and I have even been known to fight over who gets to drive it! We've put 24,000 miles on it in approximately 18 months!

**The first review that I ever wrote on epinions was regarding my Saturn SL1. Since then, I have gained a lot of insight into epinions and realized that some of my earlier reviews were not of the highest quality. I have since deleted the original review, in order to replace it with this one.**

On October 12, 1999, my husband and I bought our first new car together. We shopped around, going to dealerships and also researching online, for quite awhile before making our final decision to lease a Saturn SL1. 

PRICE:
First of all, I have to admit that price was a major factor in the purchasing of our vehicle, and ultimately, played a big role in our decision-making. With the help of our friendly Saturn saleswoman, we were able to minimize our payments--definitely an important thing for us, as my husband was still in college, we were young, and we had a young child. By putting down an additional $1,500 to supplement the $1,500 that I received for my trade-in (a 1989 Honda Civic in need of some expensive work), we were able to keep our lease payments well within our budget--$179 a month for a 48 month lease. That was so much lower than any other dealership was able to offer us.

SALESPEOPLE/SERVICE:
We found the Saturn sales staff to be very helpful, without being pushy or phony. 
Perhaps the best feature of the Saturn company is their service staff. We're over a year and a half into our lease, and we continue to bring our vehicle to the Saturn dealership for servicing--including oil changes, inspections, and standard maintenance. The service staff is friendly, helpful and fast. And I have found that the cost is actually less than we would pay at other places. In addition, our Saturn dealership has a very nice waiting area, complete with telephones, desks, television with satellite dish, and children's playroom to make your wait more enjoyable. Also, for those people who need to drop their car off for servicing, Saturn offers a shuttle service to take you to wherever you need to go while your car is in the shop. 

Some of the features that our 1999 Saturn SL1 has include good handling (even on icy or wet roads--which I was able to test during our rough winter weather this year); wonderful safety features; good gas mileage (approximately 30 mpg in the city); a nice, sleek look; and the feel of a mid-sized car versus a little compact (plenty of trunk room and passenger space).

We didn't opt for a lot of extra features when we bought our car, as we were trying to keep the cost down, but I do wish that we had chosen to get the power-package, which would have included power door locks and windows. But hey--we'll just have to get that on our next Saturn!
