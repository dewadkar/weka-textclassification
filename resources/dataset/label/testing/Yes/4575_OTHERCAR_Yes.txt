            This is one sweet machine!  My wife and I decided to buy an Infiniti, since we had heard and read so much about the reliability of this brand.  One test drive convinced me that the I30 was the model for me.

When you step on the gas, you are quickly propelled down the highway.  No hesitation or stutter here.  The I30t is equipped with stiffer suspension and it shows in the tight handling around turns and corners.  The Bose sound system and CD player deliver crisp and distortion-free renditions of your selected music.  And this baby looks sharp!  Great looking aluminum alloy wheels, a beautiful paint job and a general look of richness make this a car to admire.

We've got 60,000 miles on our car and have encountered only one minor problem - the &quot;on&quot; light in the seat-heating switch burned out.  The I30t has been a delight for us and we highly recommend this model.  A '96 model can be purchased for under $17 grand now, and trust us, that's a heck of a bargain.  Get to your Infiniti dealer and buy one of these beauts soon!<br><br>
