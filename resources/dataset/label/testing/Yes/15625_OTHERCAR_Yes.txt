            I Purchased the Sony FD 91 after using the FD51 and FD71 models at our weekly newspaper. I chose it because it uses floppy disks, both cheap and plentiful, rather than expensive and hard to find smart cards.
Use of the cameras, especially the nearly megapixel FD91, allowed us to close down our darkroom. We are not only digital. Soon we plan to buy the new Sony Model 88 which has a higher megapixel range. We use it with Adobe Photoshop software and get good results as long as we lighten up the images. For daytime sports the 1/4000 shutter speed is great. 
Drawbacks include poor performance in nightime sports events and difficulty autofocusing in high winds, but you can manually focus. 
The FD 71 flash was very strong, but the FD91 flash is somewhat weak. With the 91 I have to be within 5 feet for it to make much difference.
We use mainly back and white, but we have done color separations through Adobe Photoshop as tiff images and then through Quark Xpress as our layout and separation program and the results were quite good.
The reason we choose the Mavica over other digital cameras despite some with lower prices and higher pixel county is the floppy disk feature which gives us unlimited photos at a low investment in media.<br><br>
