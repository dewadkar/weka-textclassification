            This Omni was produced in December of 1990, the last year of their production. I am fortunate to have inherited one of the last in a fine legacy of automobiles. My grandmother handed me the title to this bright red, unmodified, perfectly kept little hatchback early this year as a high school graduation gift. Six years of indoor storage under a car cover preserved this vehicle with only 26,000 original miles registered on the odometer. After towing it to a mechanic to have the car checked out and tuned up, his report indicated almost perfect tuning, wheel alignment and only suggested replacing the front brake calipers due to slight warping. Driving the car for these six months has been a pleasant experience. I have not driven an Omni produced prior to 1990, however on allpar.com an Omni page tells their history and leads me to a safe conclusion. I own one of the most dependable, light and responsive cars that were a product of trial and error that began in 1978. Models prior to 1990 did not have a driver�s side airbag. This may be something to consider replacing when buying an older Omni. The interior of the car is spotless�the dash and upholstery is in perfect condition and everything still smells like new. The exterior is in immaculate condition. It had a couple of tiny 1mm rust spots I easily removed and touched up. The paint is still bright red and the clear coat has only broken down slightly. It will take several more years of being outside in the rain before it gets down to the paint, however storing it indoors as I do should extend its protection. My grandmother original purchased this car used, but only had the 6,000 miles the dealer put on it. She put on an additional 20,000 miles driving around town between 1991 and 1994. At this time, she moved to Japan and the car was stored in a warehouse in Cincinnati, OH. Now that it has been uncovered, tuned up and washed, it runs perfectly. I was not surprised when it easily made the drive from Savannah, GA to Atlanta on one tank of gas with a little left over. The car cruises at 75-80 mph when the engine runs at about 3400 rpm. The transmission is geared perfectly for this speed. I believe the electronic governor limited it to about 110 mph on the flat, straight highway. 0-60 times are not horrible, but the transmission and air intake obviously limit the engine�s potential considerably. I am estimating it clocks in at around 8-9 seconds. It does not burn rubber also due to the gearing. If the air-intake could be modified and/or the transmission altered, this machine would be a fast little puppy with its 2.2 liter engine. The stock radio tuner and speakers worked perfectly to their capability, but being an audio aficionado I had to replace the whole system. The only true modification I made to the car itself are two 6x9� holes cut through the trunk cover just inside the hatchback. These holes fit two Clarion 6x9s. Below these sits two 10� woofers in a single enclosure firing to the rear of the trunk. The 5� mid-ranges in the forward doors were also replaced with Clarions. Driving this system is a Kameleon 1din height cd-player head-unit feeding a 4-ch American Pro discount amp bridged to power the two woofers as low freq subs. The Kameleon itself powers the other four speakers. The head-unit has an external standard RCA input to which I connected a Sony E-800 portable minidisc player wired with a remote jog-dial controller. Overall, this automobile sounds great engine-wise and audio-wise, drives responsively and reliably and the fuel economy is excellent. If there are any cars out there in this condition, with a little investment towards an upgrade of the audio system you can enjoy a fine automobile people will admire. You will not be surprised when people comment on the fine new paintjob even though it is original, or how it starts instantly with the twist of the ignition since best of all, you will be a happy and impressed owner.<br><br>
