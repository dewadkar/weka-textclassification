            LOVE MY FORESTER!!!!!!!!!  This is my first Subaru and have been 100% pleased with it.  I live in VT and it handles the poor road conditions like a dream.  When I come home during bad weather and my husband asks me if the roads were bad I usually say, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  It handles like a pro.  Great pick-up on the highway.  Easy shifting.  Couldn't ask for better viewing.  Huge amount of windows for GREAT viewing in any conditions.  I went from a minivan to this when I didn't need as much room---very glad I did.  Good for 4 people to ride in but fairly squishy in back seat if more than 2 people are in it.  Comfortable seating, attractive interior, haven't had any problems (short of taking it in for a recall problem to be fixed--which hadn't been a problem for me).  Good AC and heating system, defrost works well (had a terrible problem with a past Honda is why I mention defrost).  Not bad gas mileage but I think it does better than most 4WD/AWD vehicles.  I think it has more room for cargo than comparable models but it can seem kind of small at times---could be used to my old minivan.  Would highly recommend this vehicle to someone that needs a vehicle that is good in snow or needs 4WD.  Don't think I'd recommend this vehicle to people with more than 2 kids---room can be limited.<br><br>
