            I bought my 91 Jeep Cherokee Laredo a little under a year ago.  It was the first vehicle that I personally own and I really love it.  

We were having a rough winter in Illinois when i bought it, and I decided on it because i knew that it would be safer and more dependable than a car without four wheel drive.  I was right about that.  While I saw many of my car driving and even truck driving friends fishtailing their way out of parking lots every day, with my four wheel drive engaged, i was good to go.  The Jeep handles great in adverse and off road situations.  It's very hard to get a Jeep stuck.  In fact, i was just reading an article that did a comparison on the Jeep and about 10 other small sport utility vehicles in its class, and the Jeep was the only one that didn't get stuck in the snow on their slippage trial.

There are some repairs i have had to make since getting it, such as much of the coolant system, but that was due to the previous owner's neglecting it.  I also had an alarm malfunction that was causing something to strike the flywheel on the transmission, which was originally thought to mean there was a transmission problem.  It was quite a scare, but when we took it in to an expert, he quickly found out it was the cheap alarm, not the truck, and he himself commented on the great in-line 6 cylinder setup and the transmission, saying that it was perhaps the greatest pair-up jeep had ever had. 

The power setting for the transmission is a real boost to the already quick-footed acceleration on the Jeep.  Let me tell you, if you need to get up to speed, Laredo has no problems with that at all.  Its 0-60 is impressive.  

I find the interior a little sparse. It does annoy me that there aren't cup holders, but i have since adapted to that.  One thing i will say is that there's a lot of room to transport stuff, with the seat folded down and the back space.  it hauls quite a bit, although it is underestimated because of its size.  Most of the time my passengers have no complaints, although it is a bit hard to step up into.  Taller people may find it a bit cramped.  But overall, compared to some of those tiny two doors and squashed four door cars, it's totally a step up, although it's no Suburban.

Handling is smooth and responsive.  Some people don't like tight curve hugging, but i sure do.  Gas mileage is fair, about 18-21 miles to the gallon depending, although 4 wheeling or using the power trans setting will deteriorate that.  this little truck is dependable, fun to drive, capable, great handling, and frankly, I love the thing.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone, and have, who is looking for a medium sized, capable, reliable vehicle and who wants something they can put a few friends in for a  road trip.

In closing, I love my Jeep!
I think if you buy one, you will soon be attached as i am to it.
