            The NSX is the best handling car I have ever driven. Loves twisty mountain roads. The way it reacts to the driver's input is scary! Love that VTEC roar! As much at home in traffic as it is on the highyway. The looks you get in this car is hysterical. I have nearly caused accidents from people breaking their necks looking at it. From what I have heard, the NSX goes through tires (especially the rears) but I haven't driven mine enough to tell as of yet. I wasn't exactly thrilled with the Bose stereo. Acura could do much better. The only major complaint I have is lack of heart stopping power. The NSX is not a stop light terror. Fast, yes, but if you're gunna shell out $90-$100k for a brand new one, you should be able to ruin every Mustang Cobra and Corvette C-5 owner's day. As well as make a Viper or Ferrari owner think twice. If you're willing to spend the $10k for the Comptech supercharger, I think you could come very close to doing just that. I give mine 5 stars, cuz I bought it used or should I say &quot;pre-owned&quot;. 4 for a brand new one. 290-300hp not enough for $100k.

The NSX is available with a 3.0-liter DOHC 24-valve V-6 with 252 hp or a 3.2-liter DOHC 24-valve V-6 with 290 hp. It also has an option of a 6-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic(available only on the 3.0 liter engine). This car is rear wheel drive. <br><br>
