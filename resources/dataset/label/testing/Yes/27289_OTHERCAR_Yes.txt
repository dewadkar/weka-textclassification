            A few months ago, my husband and I were looking for a new vehicle.  So I had the opportunity to test drive a Durango.  I fell in love with the vehicle for many reasons.  It was such an easy ride that I don't seem to remember any vehicle I had driven or riden before.  The Durango comes in various colors.  It takes curves without any problems.  You have to remember that a truck is a truck.  You need to be careful with it when taking curves.  The seats are pretty comfortable and so is the steering.  There is almost no efforts from your part.  

I test drove a golden Durango.  I was ready to tell the salesperson to get the papers ready.  When I heard the quote, I knew I could not afford it yet.  I had to settle for less.  A Toyota Corolla ended up doing well for me.  If you try a Durango, you will never ask to drive another vehicles.  You will feel on to of the world.  My husband knew about my love for this vehicle.  So he just came along.
