            I cannot agree more, or top, HawkinsRN's review on this camera so I'll just add a couple points.

I was the very-satisfied owner of an Olympus 450Z until a couple weeks ago when I accidentally dropped it and took it in for repair.  I usually never purchase extended warranties on electronic products, but I did on the camera when I purchased it 13 months ago.  I was shocked when the service counter informed me that they didn't repair digicams and simply gave me the original purchase price as credit to buy another one!!

Feeling like a &quot;kid at Christmas&quot;, I headed for the camera department with a $435 credit voucher.  After spending almost an hour with a very knowledgeable sales rep, I chose to stay with Olympus.  Some of that decision was based on the fact that I had purchased some accessories that didn't work with some other brands (i.e.; Fuji), but most of the decision was based on my satisfaction with my 450Z photos.

I was tempted to spend some extra $$ and pick up the 490Z, but in the end decided on the 460Z for $399!!  (The 450Z is no longer manufactured.)

I have now used the 460Z for the last two weeks, and more extensively than usual through the last week of Thanksgiving celebrations and family visits, and I am in total awe!

Olympus has incorporated a couple BIG improvements in this new model, including MUCH easier to use LCD menus and extended battery life configuration.

I know this camera doesn't fit in the same comparison range with some of the $1,500+ digi's, but for the price, I can easily print lab-quality prints with my Epson Photo 870 printer (using good photo paper) and also publish stunning photos on the web.

A very easy to use &quot;point and shoot&quot; with the added bonus of zoom is enough to keep me happy for a long time, and, at this price, everyone wins with this camera!<br><br>
