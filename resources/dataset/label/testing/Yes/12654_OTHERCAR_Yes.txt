            I am the proud owner of a '95 Jimmy. It has over 125,000 miles on it and has NEVER left me stranded at the side of the road. The 4.3 Vortec coupled with the 4L60 transmission gives this truck good low end 'grunt' while maintaining great gas economy. The drawbacks are few, and generally only apply to off road enthusiasts. 30 inch tires are as large as you can go without significantly modifying the vehicle, but I have found its size and weight make it an agile and nimble performer on and off the road. I highly recommend it to anyone as their daily driver or even as a weekend trip taker.

As for mechanical reliability, I had to replace the transmission at 100,000 miles which is average for the 4L60. The engine still has plenty of power and acceleration, as I travel the Long Island Expressway at a cruising speed of about 70-75 mph (sorry Mr. Highway Patrolman!) As with any piece of machinery, care and maintenance is the key! Off the road, I have gotten stuck only once, when I was a little slow to engage the four wheel drive, otherwise, this vehicle performs admirably in snow, mud and sand.

This vehicle is perfect for the job it performs daily, trucking me to the South Bronx to work. It will do so rain, shine, sleet or snow (sound familiar?) I recommend it to anyone who must commute and be into work no matter the weather (are you hearing this Firefighters, Paramedics, Police, etc?)

The fit and finish on this truck, I found, was superb, I had to remove several panels when installing the aftermarket stereo, and upon replacement, there has not been a rattle or even a squeak! The exterior body panels fit together tightly and do not show a trace of wear.

As to its drawbacks, yes there is a mushy brake pedal, but once you drive it for some time, it is less noticeable. The spare tire mount did squeak at first until I figured a little Armor-all applied monthly usually does the trick. As for wet weather handling, the original tires (which shall remain nameless)did not perform well at all. Shod with capable tires, this truck stays glued to the road. 

All in all I have to be honest, this is a great truck, and I would buy another one. I highly recommend it to those I have stated above, and to anyone else who is in need of a good reliable form of transportation that is fun to drive!

Now for an update!

This truck has been driven for another 10,000 miles since I have originally authored this epinion. And she still is working hard! This looks like it will go the distance. Let's be honest here. I dont work for GM, and really owe them no allegiance, however I cannot say enough about this vehicle. <br><br>
