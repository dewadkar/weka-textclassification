            I use the Olymapus D-600L at school and think that it it the best one of the five that we have.  This camera is very useful for taking pictures for pep assemblies and also every day events.  The things that I like about this camera is that it has a lot of different options depending on where the picture is being taken and also the numberous ammount of ways that you can down load the pictures onto your computer (Flash card 3.5&quot; adapter, parelle port).  This camera is equiped with a Flash card slot. The only things wrong with this is that it goes through batteries very fast and also it takes a while to get the lighting right to your specifications especally indoors.<br><br>
