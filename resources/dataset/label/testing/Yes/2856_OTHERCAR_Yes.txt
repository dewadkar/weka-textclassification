            As you stroll onto the car lot you see a beast in the corner.A menacing 200 horse power beast ready to eat up all other cars on the road.An eclipse? Dusted. Even muscle cars are in a world of hurt when they attempt to act bold on you.And with so many upgrade possiblities,its almost too easy.I have a base model with sport sequential shift meaning automatic or manual fun on the road. No wonder why its the #1 rated car in its class by car and driver magazine.It handles like no other simply put,not even the Audi coupe could hang with this monster.You would have to slap down at least a thousand bucks on suspension to even consider another car.Double wishbone suspension can soak up twice as many bumps as any other sports car out there,and it looks great too!All inside a 2900 pound car.It sounds heavy but with a 2.2 liter V-tech engine it offers performance and extreme power in a pricey but reliable package.Honda is reliability thats why they have one of the highest resale values on the market today.The first maintenance is recommended at 105,000 miles,now thats rock solid.And it will help your pocketbook out in the long run by saving gas,I get about 32 miles to the gallon with intake,exhaust and pulleys to ease the stress on my engine.And those upgrades only cost me 450$.Do yourself a favor and remember how fun it is to drive a beautiful car like this,and see how many people will ask you to look at it.And how many women will eye you!I love this car and I had a range rover before it,so I know good cars.And believe me its worth every penny you spend.<br><br>
