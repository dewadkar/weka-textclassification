            Going the distance is what comes to mind with the honda accord. With great gas milage and comfort during the drive. The car has a comfort to it in driveing for long durations. Its interior is nice to look at and easy to use. The range of the size of the driver is great. I am 6'2 and I find it comfortable and my girlfriend is 4'8 and she loves it as well. The controlls are comfortable to use. The standard stick is fluid and smooth. It is very quiet with little engin sound. After 93,000 miles it has required little service. The replacement of brakes and air conditioning after 8 years in the south. It is rather low to the ground and does not have great handeling in the snow, it is very controlable though with the front wheel drive. Being a 1992 model with 93,000 miles under it now. It is still going the distance with out hurting the wallet.<br><br>
