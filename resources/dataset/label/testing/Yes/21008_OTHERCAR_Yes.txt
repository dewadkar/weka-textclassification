            I love the 1999 Toyota &quot;RAV4&quot;. I purchased on this year and will never buy any other. It is fully equipped, drives like a car, has all wheel drive, and is not only comfortable, but very affordable. It is perfect for a small family and is very safe.
Just recently I was in a very bad car accident. I was hit from behind by a very large delivery truck. My Rav4 took the impact great. No one was hurt and even though it had a lot of repair work it has had not one problem.
It gets great gas mileage and comes with a lot of many stanard options other trucks don't. Honestly I don't think I will be buying any other suv for a long time. Not only is the &quot;RAV4&quot; a great little truck, but Toyota has a great reputation as a car maker.
I would recomend this car to anyone looking for a small family car, and I have.<br><br>
