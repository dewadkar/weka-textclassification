            I bought this camera after several long weeks of comparison shopping; price checks, review reading, and spec sheet analysis. I was very glad that I chose this model. 

I was looking for a camera that would perform at a mid-level for a low-level price. To me, over 2 megapixels was a must. This camera has 2.2 which is great for it's price range. And I wanted a reliable product that I could trust. After roughly 5 months of use I can say that this has it all but I'll get into more detail about that. 

PICTURE QUALITY: A 

You are not likely to find a camera that outputs a nicer picture than this camera in this price range. I must, however, talk about one negative here that may bother some consumers. The picture quality at the maximum size is not very good at all. The image is blurry and there is a good amount of "noise" or a dusty look to it. BUT, to me that is not a very bad thing. I will never use a picture that large anyway--it doesn't even fit on your monitor so you wouldn't even use it as a wallpaper. The 800 size which is most standard monitor sizes is more than adequate, in fact it's pretty good. The pictures that you will resize to view on your computer are going to look great. The clarity in these is absolutely amazing. Especially considering the cost of the camera. Any size 800 and under looks virtually flawless. 

PRINTS: A 

As long as you have a good printer that can handle pictures well and some quality gloss paper, this camera will give you great results for print outs. It's great if you don't just want to keep your albums on the PC. You do lose a minor portion of the crispness but it is not really even noticeable to the untrained eye. The quality here depends on the printer for the most part.

SOFTWARE: B 

I like the transfer software, from which you can edit your photos as soon as you load them into your computer, but that's about the best the software has to offer. A problem I have noticed is that there doesn't appear to be a resizing option when you are finished editing your photos. It would be a very convienient option but I haven't found it. I just use the "Film Factory" program that I got with my Epson printer to do that and it works great. I don't like the photo album program but only because it is difficult to figure out. I think if you spend a good amount of time with it, it can be a nice program. It is definitely an attractive and well presented one at least. 

The camera doesn't come with the highly touted "easyshare dock" and you have to purchase that seperately at a fairly high cost. However, I would not advise you to do so. The USB cable that connects right to your computer is more than good enough. It is very easy to transfer pictures from the camera to a folder in your computer without that docking system.

EASE OF USE: A+ 

This is by far the camera's best feature. Anyone can learn to use this camera in a small amount of time, even those not particularly technically gifted. The manual provides good reports on hoe to operate it and the buttons and settings are not complicated at all. You just turn it on by switching to regular viewfinder or LCD screen (which I only use for previews after a shot anyway) and make sure it's on the photo setting. Other settings include the preview setting where you can look at what you've taken and an options setting. 

PERFORMANCE: B 

It is generally a solid performer, and by that I mean the way it works, not it's picture quality. Problems I noticed are as follows: 

-it has a semi-slow processing speed after you press the button and before the picture info is stored so you can't get exactly what you want out of a motion shot unless you time it right--in other words the picture doesn't capture instantaniously. 

-***Also, you must note that you cannot take a picture and quickly move the camera away. It takes a half a second to actually snap the shot after you press the button. So before you bring it back down after a photo, remember that you have to wait a second first. 

-One problem is the zoom. I don't really need a zoom for what I do but some may and this camera only has digital zoom. It isn't nearly as good as OPTICAL which the more expensive cameras have. You loose quality with every inch you zoom in with the digital. I think that it is just a small aspect that this camera is missing compared with it's overall value.  But, if a zoom is important to you this camera probably isn't the one you should get.


BUILD: A 

It's not the most expensive or classy looking camera out there but that's not always important. I would have preferred a little chrome one but oh well. This camera is not bad looking. It's best feature in it's build is it's feel and ease of use. It has a pretty good grip and is not very scary to hold like some other cameras that look way too delicate to take places. 


I like this camera and if you can get it for a good price than you should really consider it as well. For pure performance in comparison to all options I would give it a 3/5 but in its price range I believe it is the best (4/5 stars).

NOTE: Remember to use lithium batteries. The battery life by the way is really good with this camera granted you don't always use the LCD screen for taking pictures. I use the eye piece.
