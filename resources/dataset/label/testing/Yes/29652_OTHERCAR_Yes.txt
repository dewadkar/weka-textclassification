            I purchased my Acura after much research on the World Wide Web and in car magazines.  The car had rave reviews wherever I looked.  The way I became sold on the Integra is when I took it for a test drive.  It is comfortable to ride in and it sticks to the road like a sports car should.  The acceleration is quite good and the controls are in handy locations. It is also an extremely reliable car.
I highly recommend the car but would caution those with bad backs or those unable to get in or out of low to the ground vehicles.  It is recommended to test drive the car to make sure the height of the car will not cause any future problems.
I have had several cars in my lifetime so far and the Integra is, by far,
the best car I have ever owned.  

There is nothing that I dislike about my Acura.
