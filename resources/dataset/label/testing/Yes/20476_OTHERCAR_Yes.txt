            My family's 1996 Chevy Lumina has (thus far, knock on wood!) been fairly reliable. It has over 70,000 miles on it so far.  We recently had to get repair work done on the starter, but, apart from that, no major issues. 

The thing I like most about the Lumina is its comfort. Other cars in this price range are cramped in the back seat and have awkwardly shaped front seats. But even when we drove <b>cross-country</b> in this car, I never had a stiff back. Also, the ride is very smooth.

There are a couple of drawbacks to the 1996 Lumina, however. One is that it is not the most attractive car on the market.  Also, it seems to have too long of a hood, which makes it <b>difficult to park.</b> My family used to have a Ford Taurus (1986). The Taurus (also a "mid-sized sedan") was much easier to manouver. 

The other negative about the Lumina is that its <b>acceleration</b> is often lacking. I notice this when I first get on the highway. And it also sometimes struggles up hills on the highway, especially when the air conditioning is on.

Another strange thing is that it often <b>races</b> on the highway.  It seems that the overdrive goes into turbo mode or something, so you had better keep your eye on the speedometer.  I often look down to find myself going 80 MPH without it feeling any different.  As I said, the ride is very smooth.  

Also, the heat doesn't seem to come on as quickly as it does in other cars I have been in.

The controls on the Lumina are logical and easy to figure out and the interior is relatively attractive.  However, I don't like the fake wood trim above the glove compartment.  The Lumina has a gear shift on the steering column and an emergency brake on the floor on the left side of the regular brake.  The <b>sound system</b> is not particularly great, and it has a tape deck. 

Other features include a large trunk, two cup holders, map pockets on the back of the front seats.  Our model has A/C, power windows and locks, map lights, and anti-lock brakes.

All-in-all, I am satisfied with the Lumina. Think of it as a value-priced family car.
