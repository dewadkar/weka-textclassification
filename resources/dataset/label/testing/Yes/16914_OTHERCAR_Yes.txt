                 We just got hit with 17 inches of snow in Maryland.  The snow allowed me to test my Outback's All-Wheel-Drive.  I am very impressed with how the wagon handled on my icy obstacle course to work.  The wheels practically flew over piles of snow, the car felt stable on ice, and handled really well on slippery roads. 

     Before I bought my Subaru, I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I traveled to over 40 states in that Jeep and went off-road in about 12 of them.  After five years, I had to sell the car because I kept sinking money into it and constantly found more problems to deal with.  When I sold my Jeep, I knew I wanted a car that had 4-Wheel-Drive capabilities and style.

     I shopped around and test drove Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru.  I did not like the feel of the Toyota and Mazda when I drove them.  I felt like the cars would not respond to my foot on the pedal, and the cars felt clunky.  I was happily surprised by the speed of the Subaru.  My head jerked back ever so slightly when I put my foot to the pedal.

     I had the hardest time trying to decide between the Forester and the Outback.  Both cars had similar features and capabilities.  My three-year-old son decided for me when he put his hands on the bumper of the Outback in the showroom.  He told me, &quot;This is going to be our Batman car!&quot;  I purchased a black Subaru Outback with a leather interior and cd player. 

     I am a young single mother, and I wanted a car that reflected my needs and personality.  I felt like the style, speed, and AWD of the Outback fit my young and adventurous lifestyle.  The reliability, safety and child features appealed to the responsible mother in me.  The gas mileage is great.  The city mileage is about 21 miles per gallon which is what my Jeep got on the highway on a good day.  My son was right about our car, like the Batmobile, our Subaru wagon was dark, sleek, and very useful.  Unlike the Jeep, I feel like my Subaru will last me a lot longer than five years.  Everyone who has owned a Subaru raves about the customer service and longevity of the cars.<br><br>
