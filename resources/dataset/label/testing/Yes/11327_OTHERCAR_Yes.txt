            Three years of owning the XK8, and the only regret is that my wife drives it most of the time.

The best-looking car on the road also handles with the best of them.  This is a car to own if you want a luxury sport convertible.  Why?

<b>Style</b>
From the oval front grill to the sleek side view to the balanced profile of the tail, this car is HOT.  It turns heads wherever it goes (Not as many heads when I drive it as when my wife does, but that's another matter altogether).  We chromed the wheels for a small fortune at the dealer's, but it does add an extra spark to the profile.

<b>The top, the top!! A Quiet Convertible</b>
I've owned 3 convertibles over the years, and I expected the usual drafty, wind whistling noise.  This car is (almost) as quiet as a luxury sedan, and certainly quieter than many hardtops I have driven.  The top is padded, and even seems like a hardtop from the inside.  The rear window is glass, and has had no problem with visibility, mechanical operation or wear over the years.

<b>Performance</b>
This beauty is not just a pretty face.  It PERFORMS.  The 4 liter, 290 HP engine provides smooth, immediate power to the 3900 pound body.  Its low center of gravity and tight suspension makes turning at speed a breeze.  Emergency handling, from the traction and stability control to the tight steering, has saved me from a few potentially uncomfortable situations on the freeway.

<b>Practicality</b>
Face it, a sports convertible will never provide the seating, cargo space, headroom(till you put the top down, that is) and other practical aspects of a full-sized car.  BUT!  The trunk holds a couple of full sized suitcases, or a golf bag and carry cart.  The front seats are comfortable and adjust well to almost anyone.  The back seat holds several grocery bags (You didn't think I would say it held a person, did you?  Only a contortionist could ride in the back, and then only with the top down).

<b>Reliability</b>
We have had excellent experience with all aspects of the car's reliability.  There was this little driver's error that resulted in the right side being creased front to back.  The body shop took care of it, and we were frightened that we would have all sorts of post-accident reliability problems, but we have been pleasantly surprised!

<b>Downsides?</b>
Ok, its not perfect.  First, you have to face the reality that it's an expensive car to buy, to service and to insure.  On the latter point, be thankful for the contortionist back seat, because a 4 person car (officially, at least) has a much lower premium than a 2-seater.
Visibility for the driver with the top up is a bit limited.  The low profile top blocks some view for the taller driver.  And over-the-shoulder glances show the top, not the road.  It makes you appreciate the value of the outside mirrors even more.

<b>SUMMARY</b>
Great to look at, fun to drive, dependable, but not cheap.

Have fun if you get to drive it or own it.
