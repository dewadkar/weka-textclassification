            this is one phat car! (by the way, i am 18.)  i was considering this and the accord ex v6 when i was shopping for a car.  i ended up buying this for several reasons, by the way i have a 99 g20t in white with automatic, leather:

- there aren't 10 million other g20s on the road
- it is an infiniti. (the name infiniti has a nice ring to it)  
- i didn't want a car that my grandmother drove.  
- the handling is superb, it grips very well on hard cornering.  
- great looks (doesn't quite stand out but nevertheless it looks awesome - but that's subjective)
- the warranty/customer service of infinit is great.
- it is the perfect size, not too big so that it loses its sporty characteristics but not too small where it is cramped.
- the interior is laid out very nicely, everything is easy to see and reach.
- exceptional track record of build quality and reliability
- oh the seats!  i love the seats!  i could sit in them all day.
- great auto climate control, i get chills from the air conditioning
- safety - back when i bought it, the accord did not have side air bags yet
- the stereo is acceptable
- road noise is minimal, and the engine is quiet and refined
- the front air dam is pretty low (looks great)

yet, it does have its downfalls:

- the engine is WEAK.  a mule could get to 60 before the g20.  it is decent for normal driving, but for those aggressive drivers, this is not for you.  the power comes at too high of an rpm.
- terribly designed cupholders in the front, i just store my loose change in there.
- the front air dam is pretty low (gets scratched easily)

so there it is, go test drive one and understand...
