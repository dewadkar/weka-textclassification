            I talked to people who have owned Toyotas. They raved. They talked about the car like it was member of the family. They told me stories of how their Camry's outlived the family pets. They talked about the car being passed from generation to generation.

I went to the dealer and looked at the new Toyotas. Now, I'm an engineer by trade. I have an eye for details and for flaws. What I saw in the Toyota Camry was nothing short of perfection. This car was designed and built with incredible attention to detail. And when you put this kind of attention into the design, you get a car that will run without problems for many, many years.

All right. Enough gushing over design. Is it comfortable? Yes again. The seat has a good range of adjustment, and there is plenty of headroom for those of us over 6 feet tall. The controls are very well laid-out. The temperature controls heat up the car quickly (very important feature, as I write this in Pennsylvania in February!)

Is it fun? Yes, this car is good fun to drive. Even with the 4-cylinder engine, this car has plenty of acceleration. And I still get between 25 and 30 miles per gallon, depending on how much highway driving I am doing.
