            Dodge has decided to follow in the footsteps of nissan by coming out with a foor door smaller truck.  The Frontier was the first of its kind.  Dodge is making a version of the dakota that is foor door.  This truck may look pretty good like the Ram does but it will have the same problems that any other dodge has....bad transmission.  The Fronteir in my view is a very good looking truck.  And since it is a nissan it will last much longer than the dodge.  I would spend my hard earned money on a truck that lasts.  This entails I would buy the nissan over the dodge anyday.  The dodge may have more towing capacity but why buy a smaller truck for towing anyway??<br><br>
