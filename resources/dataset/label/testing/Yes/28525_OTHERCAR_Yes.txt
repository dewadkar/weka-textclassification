            I traded in my 2001 Envoy for the 2003 H2 LUX edition.  Prior to the Envoy, I had a 1999 Range Rover and prior to that a 1998 Land Rover Discovery.  If you want to be noticed (which may be a con, dependent on your personality) and have real command on road and off, I can strongly recommend the H2.  A few months ago on a whim, I ventured out to my local Hummer dealer for a test drive not really knowing what to expect other than I liked the look of the truck.  I was surprised by the ride, acceleration, and overall interior appointments.  I was H2 hooked and fortunately had a brother-in-law in the business who found me a favorable spot on the reservation list.  I was told that otherwise I would have a 2 to 4 month wait.  Your dealer might be different, but H2 has tried to limit a dealer's willingness to sell out of their geographic area by cutting back on dealer incentives for cars sold to individuals who reside in another dealers territory.

Anyway, we solved the rear cargo space problem by having the full-size spare mounted on the outside of the truck which opens up half the rear cargo space.  The third seat pops out as well.

I have taken the H2 off-road on several occasions.  Your H2 dealer is required (as a condition to holding the franchise) to organize 4 Hummer off-road events per year.  My dealer had the first a few months back and it really gave me an appreciation for the truck's capabilities.  There is no question that this truck will take you wherever you need to go.  On a recent rip to Colorado, we climbed Pikes Peak and Chyenne Mountain and I was most impressed on the descent.  I popped the H2 into Low 4wd, engaged the traction control, put it in 3rd gear and proceeded down both mountains without having to brake and every moment feeling 100% in control.

On the trip to Colorado, between Amarillo TX and Texline (at the tip top of the Texas Panhandle) we encountered 30 miles of iced roads.  I noticed the trucks (with their light rear ends) slipping from time to time, but the H2 stayed put.  I also felt comfortable knowing that if I had to bail off the road because of some bad driver or other problem, I would be able to get back on.

The H2 has really excellent acceleration and handling for its size.  I'm getting 12.6 miles to the gallon which is 3 miles less per gallon than the Envoy and about the same mileage per gallon as the Range Rover.
