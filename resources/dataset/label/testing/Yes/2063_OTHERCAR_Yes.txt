            Design:
Very compact, easy-to-use and good looking camera.

Picture Quality:
Outdoor: Excellent in all weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, ...)
Indoor: Very good (if reminding the flash-range 1.5m-2.5m)

Flash:
The flash-range is very limited (1.5m-2.5m) If your subject is out of this range, this will cause over- or under exposure.
When using the flash, you have to keep your fingers on the grip. Holding a finger somewhere between the grip and the lens will cause reflections towards the lens, resulting in hazy images.

Storage:
The internal memory stores 6 to 30 images (depending on the resolution)
The camera has a Compact Flash Slot, so you can expand the memory as you prefer.

WebCam:
Very good quality.
Very handy with the included camera mount.

Pricing:
Very affordable camera!
