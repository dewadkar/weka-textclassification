            The 1984 Honda Civic Hatchback was the first car I bought all by myself. I bought it two years ago.  My dad looked it over and said that despite it being 14 years old it was in perfect condition.  The former owners told me that they had never had any problems with it and they seemed to express a great love for the honda corporation.
I bought it just because I was 17 and wanted to have a car to drive to school in and to drive around on the weekends.  Little did I know all that would happen to it.
A man backed into it with his SUV--which is twice the size of my little car. Yet despite the force of the blow from his giant machine my car took it well and only had a crumped dent infront of the driver side door.  I, in my youthful wrecklessness crashed into a iron fence.  But it kept going on strong. 
The Hatchback is wonderful on the highway. My boyfriend lived 35 minutes away from me, however with my 1984 Honda Civic Hatchback I was passing Mustangs and making it to his house in under 15 minutes.  But, those hundred mile per hour drives aren't the best of it's abilities.  In fall of 1999 I was to begin college.  The college I went to was 100 miles away from home.  Every weeekend and sometimes mid-week I would drive my little car to Kansas City from Emporia and it never overheated, never broke down along the way never started to make funny noises.
Honda Civics are survivors. 
My 16 year old car is still starting when I turn the ignition. 
Once the ignition-switch was broken, but my dad and I had an easy time fixing it. 
That is the most of the problems.<br><br>
