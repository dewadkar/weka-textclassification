            I bought my NX when I was 29 years old, 1997 import to the UK from Cyprus (brand new). I was fast approaching middle age. I wanted a car that was different to the other Nissans I have owned, Sunny (X2) and the ever dependable Primera. Different is exactly what I got. When it is good, it is the nippiest thing on four wheels, will squeeze itself into the tightest of parking spaces and start at the sight of its key! When it is bad, it is the most unyielding car on the planet. 3 breakdowns in the past four weeks have tested my patience of late. Yet, with a bit of TLC from yours truly and my NX is back in favour and behaving impeccably once again.
     The people who should buy this car are those who want a sporty car without all the usual 'look at me' gimmicks and gadgets. Those who want spontaneous pure performance in a car that they could trust there 17 year old daughter to drive, and there daughter would feel that it enhanced her street cred with its roof off.
