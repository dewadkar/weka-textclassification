                 I bought the 1999 Camry to replace my existing Toyota Corolla.  I have had a Toyota as my primary car since 1969 because of their reliability and low cost of upkeep.  I have put over 200,000 miles on each of them.  I would expect this car to last as long as the previous ones.
     I factory ordered the car for two reasons.  I wanted the V6 with a manual transmission and the cars available in the northwest region with those options did not have the color I wanted nor the optional side air bags.  When the car arrived I was told that the side air bags could not be installed with that engine/transmission combination (no satisfactory technical reason for this was given).
     Now that I have driven over 8500 miles in it, I can say that the car performs even better than my expectations except for the fact that the transmission shifts a little roughly.  After trips in to two different service departments and a call to the national center all that can be said is that front wheel drive manual transmissions are shifted through a cable system and the cable system cannot be designed to shift as smoothly as a linked, rear wheel drive transmission.
     If you prefer an automatic, you should find no problems with this vehicle.  I am still sold on Toyotas.  <br><br>
