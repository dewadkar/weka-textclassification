            The S2 has been compared to the Nikon D100 and the Canon D60 since day one due to similar price range and native resolutions. The S2 has been my choice and this is why.

Resolution: 
12 megapixels out of the camera, ok interpolated from a 6.1mp CCD, but most online and print reviewers tend to agree the pictures do contain at least 8mp worth of details.  Regardless of absolute resolution, the S2 definitely gives more details than either the D100 or the D60.

Connectivity:
The S2 has firewire and USB1.1 built in. Firewire is not only faster, but also allows the S2 to be remotely controlled via a computer.  This allows remote captures and timed captures directly into your computer's harddisk.

Battery:
The S2 uses AA batteries which are cheap and easily available.  However, to use the built in flash, you will also need to put in CR123A lithium cells, which lasts about 300 flashes.  Compared to the Canon or the Nikon, this split battery arrangement is not very elegant, and those other two cameras both use a single lithium rechargeables to power the whole camera, but considering how much those rechargeable lithiums cost, it's not too big a plus point for them.

Ease of use:
The S2 has a good layout of buttons on the back, very logical and easy to use. 4 dedicated menu buttons makes it very quick and easy to choose the colour, tone, sharpening, white balance, compression levels.

I can go on and on why I chose the S2, but the above were my main reasons.

A side note on anyone coming from a consumer level camera though. The S2 isn't meant to be a point and shoot camera, you can use it as point and shoot of course, but a consumer level compact may do better at that department.  What the S2 or any digital SLR excels at doing is providing a level of control and quality of output that no other compact digital camera can yet give.

Also, remember to budget for lenses and a decent flash if coming from non Nikon SLR background.

The S2 has been in very very very short supply in the UK since its launch due to some problems with the logistics computer at Fuji UK (SAP upgrade apparantly). As a result, dealers are very relutant to price match, and prices are not as low as can be I think.
