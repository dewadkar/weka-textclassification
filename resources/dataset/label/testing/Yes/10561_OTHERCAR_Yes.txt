                I have driven a wide variety of cars over the past few years.  I have become what many would call a "very picky driver" as far as what I choose to drive is concerned.  Of all the cars I have driven, by far, the Acura Integra Sedan is my favorite.  

    You may ask yourself, "Why, of all vehicles would he choose the Acura Integra?"  The reason is simple.  Comfort.  When I drive across town to go shopping or take a road trip to the beach or mountains, I want to enjoy my drive.  I have had many trips in which my back would get sore in other cars, or I felt that the car I was in was not sporty enough, or did not accelerate from a stop fast enough.  Not in the Integra though.  

    Also, it is one of the only modern cars that looks good with a spoiler.  Very sporty.  I cannot be entirely one sided though, so, I do in fact have one complaint.  The only problem I have ever found with this particular car, is the back seat.  I don't see it as roomy enough, when traveling with more than one passenger.  If this problem could be fixed with the new models,  I believe Acura would have the perfect car.  I recommend this car for just about anyone unless they have a large family in which case I would go with the Ford Windstar.  Happy driving.
