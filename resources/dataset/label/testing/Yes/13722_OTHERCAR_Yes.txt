               The BMW 328Ci is a car that fulfilled my expectations of a German sports care of its class. It looks fast, it goes fast, and it will empty your pocket book fast just as the 3 series usually does. While I don't own one, YET, I did take one for a test drive after I strolled around in my buddy's BMW.

   The 328Ci that I drove was silver with jet black interior...I fell in love at first site. The leather seats were extremely comfortable and were easy to adjust to my preferences. The inside also had a great sound system that was easy to control while driving. The sun roof controls were also easy to reach and activate, what's a BMW with out a sun roof, it's an additional option yet a must.

   The price for this sporty sports car is not all that bad. It runs $33,990 for the base model. The 328Ci that I drove cost about $35,000 due to the sun roof, leather seats, and the cd player. The engine is what I like best about this BMW. This 5 speed manual sports a 2.8 liter I6. Its capable of delivering 193 horsepower at 5500rpm and 206 lbs of torque at 3500rpm. The gas mileage is 21 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway.

   It's really simple. This car is a lot of fun to drive and has great handling. On the other hand, it's not for hauling the family to weekend ballgames. If your looking for a sporty BMW with a decent price, the 328Ci is for you.
