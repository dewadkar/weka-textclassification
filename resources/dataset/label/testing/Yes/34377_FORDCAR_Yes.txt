            I purchased my 1998 Ford Taurus in September 1999 to replace a Dodge Intrepid that I had for 9 months. The reason for the short ownership of the Dodge was that it had an incurable overheating problem, but that is another story for another review. My occupation has me traveling in my car nearly 700 miles a week. My needs were a comfortable car, which had low miles, but wouldn't break the bank. The Ford Taurus best fit these criteria. I purchased my car with just over 19,000 miles on it. It had been serviced regularly, and the papers were available to prove it. The remainder of Ford's New Car Warranty was on the car also, which covers it until the 3-year/36,000 mile mark. I certainly will not get close to the 3-year part with my current driving demands. The car has 30,000 miles on it now, and still has plenty of 'merging' power, 'passing' power, and the very important, and 'I'm late for a meeting' power. The brakes, although a bit pulsing on occasion, stop the car well. ABS is a feature lacking on my particular car. Dual airbags are standard, as is steel reinforced door framing. The driver's seat can feel a bit unsupportive at times, but after 2 hours of my big *** in it, I think that is to be expected. Personally, I do not like the seating position of the passenger side front seat. It feels to deep, and unless your car is equipped with dual power seats, there is nothing sans a pillow you can do to alleviate this. Trunk space is surprisingly abundant. Six pairs of safety belts come in the car, but the front middle belt is for all intents not useable. One other dislike I have with the car is the cup holders. To access them, you have a flip up armrest, and a flip out center section between the two front seats. All the way up and over it goes, and there are your two cup holders, varying in size, but not in 'spillability'. A third little holder appears to have been designed for lose change, but when you return the flip out thing back to it's normal position, it all spills out. And if you are a smoker, and wish to drink and smoke at the same time, buy a Dodge. You cannot access the ashtray with the cup holder in the upright position. Luckily Ford has equipped the car with an auxiliary power supply to feed your cell phone or your radar detector. (Remember the 'I'm late for the meeting' power?) I need to state that I have the 24 valve, DOHC engine. I test-drove this one, as well as one with the standard engine, and did notice a dramatic difference in handling and performance. The dealer stated that all vehicles with the performance 6-cylinder engine also would have the sport suspension package. Would I buy my car again, all things considered? You bet. Will my next car be another Taurus? Don't think so, the Chrysler 300-M is calling me. Leather seating, CD-player, now that sounds more like what my mobile office should be...<br><br>
