            The Lexus GS400 is quite the car, and it comes with frightening ramifications. For years, BMW and Mercedes dominated the midsize luxury sedan market, in both quality and appeal. However, once Lexus unveiled its newly redesigned GS 300/400, there was finally another option. 

As far as the distinction between the GS 300 and GS 400, all I�ll say is that they are completely different cars. Yes, they must look the same, but that�s where all the similarities end. The GS400 is powered by a 300 HP V8, while the GS300 has the less powerful V6. Also, for those who enjoy high performance driving, the GS400 has optional 17� wheels, which offer premium cornering ability. The GS300 doesn�t really factor into this discussion, in that it basically has the same engine as the Toyota Avalon. 

With that said, let me continue on explaining why the Lexus GS is a good choice. To the dismay of Mercedes and BMW makers, the GS simply out-performs the aforementioned cars in almost every category. It�s faster, safer AND better looking. From what I�m told by my friends who drive Mercedes or BMWs, Lexus customer service is also steps above. When you walk into a BMW/Mercedes dealership, they act like they are doing you a favor by selling you a car. It�s just not like this at Lexus. 

Enough for now of why the GS 400 is better, let me tell you a little of what it does. The car itself is FAST. It goes from 0-60 in less then 6 seconds, and despite what�s published I could swear that it�s closer to 5! The controls are all logically laid out, and the seats are both spacious and comfortable. My GS 400 has the optional navigation system, which, unlike the one in a Range Rover is amazing. 

One thing that I don�t like about the car is it�s steering. Most of the time, the steering wheel feels slightly heavy, and sometimes tends towards the left. 

This car has so much trunk space I continue to be amazed. In fact, its trunk is LARGER THAN THE LS400! I don�t know how they do that, because the rear seats are also spacious. The dashboard is bright and easy to read. One thing about the dash that I love�a nosey passenger is unable to look at the speedometer and see how fast the car is going�the angle won�t allow it. I know this may not seem like such a big deal, but it�s just a nice little perk. 

Standard also is dual climate controls, for both the passenger and driver. The CD changer is brilliantly placed in the front glove compartment, with lots of room left over for anything else one may choose to put there. Regarding the radio, think of the best sound system you have ever heard, and that is basically what the sound is like in a Lexus. 

I know this Epinion does not contain many technical specifications. I am trying to let you in on the practical issues, which will help you decide what kind of Luxury performance sedan to buy. I am not saying that a BMW or Mercedes are BAD by any means! In this series, (BMW 5, Mercedes E and Lexus GS) Lexus is simply the best. This is not the case when comparing the BMW 7, Mercedes S and Lexus LS. There, I admit the Lexus can�t compete. Over here, however, Lexus truly offers the best option. A smart, classy, fast and fun automobile!
