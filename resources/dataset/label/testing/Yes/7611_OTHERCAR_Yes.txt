            My S-10 is a 1983 long bed 2WD with a topper on it. I bought this thing sight unseen from a school teacher for $400.  I thought all S-10's were little sporty trucks until I laid eyes on this particular example.  Its a Tahoe with all the power options, but, it's really big and heavy, apparently a camper special.

Its equipped with the largest engine available at the time, a 2.8L V-6 making about 120 HP, and has the 700R4 4 speed automatic.  But at its 4100 pound curb weight, its a real chore getting on the interstate.

This model is equipped with the horrible vari-jet carb and I have yet to get the choke to work properly.  After I replaced all the rubber lines under the hood, did a major tune-up, and rebuilt the carb, gas mileage runs about 19 MPG if you don't push it too hard.

The moment I saw this truck, I nicknamed it "Moby" because its so big - about the same length as the current 1500 series Chevy truck.

With the Tahoe interior its fairly comfortable on trips.  I've managed to make it reliable enough to take some 400 mile journeys.  With the very heavy suspension this particular example has, it gets pretty bouncy running unladen on interstates.  I put new gas shocks under it, and, this improved the ride and handling dramatically.

The body on mine had a fair amount of rust damage, as expected for a $400 truck.  I've patched most of it up, and ,loaded the body cavities with rust killer.  The truck's not pretty, but, its reasonably solid now.

When I bought it, the engine was loaded with sludge, even though the previous owners had changed the oil every 3000 miles.  I pulled the valve covers and got the PCV system functioning again.  

The engine in this model is notorious for having low oil pressure.  When I bought it, everytime the engine was a hot idle, the oil pressure gauge bounced on zero.  With the PCV system fixed, and, after a number of oil changes using Castrol 20W-50 oil, she now goes no lower than 20 psi, is fairly clean internally, and uses no oil yet.  Right now the truck has 133,000 miles on it.

The radiator leaks like a sieve - to be expected because its 20 years old.  This summer, I'm going to pull it and have it patched up.  For now, its loaded with stop-leak.

Overall, its a reasonably simple truck to work on.  It has no computer, just a bucket full of vacumn controls on the engine.  My biggest challenge was stopping all the leaks under the hood - all the lines were rotten.

If you can put up with the fairly sedate performance, these trucks are built like a tank.  Mine apparently has a special heavy duty chassis under it.  The guy who put a new exhaust system under for me, said he never seen an S-10 with a chassis like this one has.

The cab on this thing is pretty small, and, the truck looks strange with the little cab and the 8 foot bed behind.  Somebody 6 feet tall, or, large would be really cramped in this thing.

Overall, I like the truck.  Its serviceable and I got it at a bargain price.
