            Well, I guess everyone knows that Hondas are as good as they get when it comes to reliability, ergonomics, engines, etc.  The only real downside I can see is that everyone these days seems to have an Accord.  I guess if someone buys one, they really don't care about that.

<b>EXTERIOR STYLING:</b>
Blah...I really can't think of any other word to use.  I do, however, like it better than the Toyota Camry.  The Accord coupe is nice.  If you do get an Accord, try and get the alloy wheels as they make the car look MUCH nicer.

<b>INTERIOR STYLING:</b>
Very nice.  Very high quality materials, comfortable seats.(However, I wish they had a bit more support for cornering.  Then again, the Ford Mustang's seats are practically flat, and its a sports car, so I shouldn't complain)  Dash layout is nice.  I really like the radio and climate controls.

<b>PERFORMANCE:</b>
Honda engines always seem to have that sophisticated, refined touch.  The 4 cyl Accords have decent power, however, the 6 cyl is smoother and has the extra power for those passing manuevers you normally wouldn't try.  The transmission on the automatics shift very smoothly, almost without noticing.

The Accord handles the twistied rather well for a sedan.  The suspension lets you turn hard without too much body roll, but at the same time, doesn't jar your insides when you hit large bumps.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
You can't go wrong with an Accord.  I, however would be willing to sacrifice some quality and reliability for something just a bit different than the rest of the crowd.
