            I always wanted a Mustang and in 99 I finally got one.. I love this car it is so nice to drive and it handles pretty good.. It is a little small but nice for trips..  It is built better than I thought.. I was rear-ended and the other car had some damage but mine didnt get much at all.. i was so shocked. I figured it would have of buckled but no.. I am so glad I did get this car and if any of my friends was to ask me I would tell them to get one also.. I have not had any problems with the car so far and it is only 6 months old and has almost 8,000 miles on it.. The pull down back seats are nice when you have to haul something that is long and wont fit in the trunk.. The trunk space is nice it will hold alot of stuff.. I have put so much in mine that I never would of thought all of it would of fit if I hadnt of seen it for myself..
 I think this car is a good investment.I am going to get a new one soon since I love it so much..If your looking for a nice sports car I would give the mustang a try.Take one out for a test drive and you will want it after that..
