            I drove a 4x2 2003 Expedition XLT with 4.6L engine.  I just changed jobs so I no longer drive a company 2003 Tahoe, so right away the experience of driving the Expedition created a stark contrast to the familiar Tahoe.  First off, the ride of the Expedition feels much more refined, has dramatically less vibration then the Tahoe, the steering tracks straighter with less correction then the Tahoe, and the Ford is quieter, smoother, and feels more like a friendly car then a tempermental heavy truck.  The transmission shifts as smooth as the Tahoe.  The Ford is longer, wider, and taller then the Tahoe, but feels like a little subcompact when you're behind the wheel because it drives so friendly, steers so easily, and the nice manuverability belies its giant size.  The 3rd seat of the Expedition provides more room for adults then does the Tahoe.  The rear independent suspension is probably the single most responsable reason for the Ford's better handling and ride then you'll find with a Tahoe which has a straight rear axle.  The Ford has standard 17" wheels, which is better then Tahoe's 16".  Ford has Tahoe beat with the conversion of the back to a flat pick-up type surface for hauling stuff.  The seats fold down flat (FLAT) quick and easier then Tahoe's setup.  The Tahoe rolled and leaned more then the Expedition.  The Ford feels more planted on the highway too, less wind noise and drive train noise then Taheo too.
