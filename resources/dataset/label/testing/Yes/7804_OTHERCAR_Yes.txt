            In July 1994, I was 5 months into a very tough pregnancy.  My husband and I had decided when I got pregnant it was time to replace our old car, which was, believe or not, a 1982 Chevy Chevette (you can see we don't get new cars much!)  However, when we started car shopping, we were so annoyed with all the pressure, the slick talk, and the tiring days of hunting.  I simply couldn't take it!  I had heard that Saturn had a no hassle style of buying, and so we headed to Saturn.  We found it was true---although they were very proud of their cars, they didn't pressure us, just had us test drive the car, and told us about its special features.  

We fell in love with a lot of things about this car!  It was so great looking, to start with.  They changed Saturn's look soon after we got this car, but we got probably the last classic year---it looks like a sports car, but has 4 doors!  I am a VERY nervous driver, but this car was very easy to drive, with clear controls, and responsive steering.  The car had a lot more features than others in its price range---AC, Automatic, a AM/FM/Cassette, etc.  We were sold!

Over the years, we have had quite mixed feeling about our purchase.  We still like the way the car looks and drives.  The car still looks pretty good, thanks to the no dent plastic side features and the classic lines.  However, now that we have 2 kids, the car feels CROWDED!  It's not a big car at all!  Also, it has a very small trunk, which for family trips is quite annoying.  

We have had a fair amount of small but annoying things go wrong with the car.  One of the weirdest was when the driver's seat somehow got broken and was subject to suddenly flipping all the way back if you leaned on it too hard!  We got that fixed, and a few months later the car was recalled for that problem, and we did get our money back for the repair.  The car has also had minor brake problems, a gummed up ERG value (beats me just what that means!), has needed a new alternator and has had some problems with the seat belts, which tend to get tangled up.

One thing I think every owner of this model would agree on this that this is a LOUD car.  I can't say how many times I've been embarrassed when my husband was waiting for me someplace and left the engine on to keep the kids cool or warm---which is loud enough so it drowns out all the conversations wherever I am---including church one time!

We got most of our service done at the dealership, and I think they are honest and fairly skilled, although a bit pricy.

When the time comes to buy a new car, which with our record probably won't be for another 4 years or so, we will certainly consider a Saturn, but it would have to be a station wagon or one of their new big models---this is not a family sized car!
