            I bought this car at the beginning of August 2003. It was very hard to find, but I called all the dealerships until I found what I was looking for: 6 speed manual with navigation and air packages. All together the damage was 37 and change. 
CONS: 
Gear shift: some problems going into 1st and / or 2nd but it goes away once it worms up. Clutch pedal is too high in my opinion, which puts you at a disadvantage when releasing the pedal. I will ask them to lower it if it is possible, at the first service appointment.
Cornering: this is the first rear wheel drive car I drove, so it took some time to get used to it. I am also taking curves at much higher speeds. The car sticks to the road great, but it is less forgiving than a front wheel drive when it comes to direction. You need a steady hand (and nerves) and I recommend using a lower gear for some engine braking help if you chicken out and an instantaneous explosion as you exit the curve.
Console: volume button on console is awkward. In fact all the controls seem somewhat randomly spread around. I still cannot work the buttons without taking my eyes off the road &#150 which is a problem at 90MPH. But we will talk about that later. Much has been said about the analog clock and I agree with all of it.
The GPS has only two options: by shortest time and shortest distance. Neither helps you if you want to choose a specific highway but not exactly sure where it is. Also shortest distance can get you in some neighborhoods where is not a good idea to have this car, even if you drive it. Trust me on this, its not pleasant.

PROS: everything else. I think they really hit a great balance between price, performance and features, especially the design. The car is just beautiful to look at.  As many have said, this car has been directly aimed at BMW. In terms of performance, the car is equivalent to the top model of the 3 series, the BMW 330. It will also eat up the lower forms of the 5 series. You can put it up against an M3 if you want, but you will loose. Same goes for the 7 series. The real advantage is that the car also looks faster. I drive about 50 miles each way everyday mostly highway (OK, I don&#146t always drive the G35). I love it when cars just get out of the way without me having to beam or honk (yes its not nice, especially if they are old ladies). 
I have honestly moved everything from Lexus (Coupes included), Mustangs and Camaros to Escalades, Explorers and everything in between.  But the real treat is of course a BMW. I just love moving those out the way just for the heck of it. Honestly this car just attracts attention. I can&#146t tell you how many times I enjoyed the drooling on the faces of other drivers as I was watching them from the corner of my eye (OK most of them are male, but does it really matter?). 
I have also become addicted to the sound of the engine and the adrenalin rush of doing 90 MPH on Northern State (Long Island, New York). Yes, there are state troopers and yes, I already got a ticket, but luckily I was not doing 90 at that particular moment. Like I said, the car looks fast even when it is not going that fast. Therefore I am fighting the ticket which is obviously unwarranted given the fact that my BREMBO brakes slowed my down real quick. 
Overall I am really happy with the car. Having a back seat is great, especially since the trunk space is minimal. No Ski Bag unfortunately and the back seat does not split, so if you go skiing, it is back to a coupe. After 5000+ miles, my average consumption is just under 20MPG as calculated by the onboard computer.
Enjoy!
