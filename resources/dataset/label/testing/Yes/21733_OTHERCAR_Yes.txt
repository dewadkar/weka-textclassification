            A Chevrolet Cavalier is a wonderful choice of car for a small family, needing room, but yet, not so much room that you feel like you are driving a boat.  The vehicle has many wonderful aspects about it.  
1) wonderful interior with space
2) great gas mileage on the highway and in city driving
3) nice look
4) reasonably priced 
5) many great features for individual needs

But, on the other hand, the Cavalier also has some disadvantages that you might want to consider before buying.
1) noisy driving, not sealed well
2) at times, there is rough riding

Over the past year of owning my Chevrolet Cavalier I have been very pleased with the vehicle overall and would recommend to anyone searching for the perfect new vehicle. <br><br>
