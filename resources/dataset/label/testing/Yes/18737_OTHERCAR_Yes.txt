            The 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a wonderful ride for the 40++ age group.  It is easy to enter, comfortable for middle aged people to sit in and is easy to drive.  It has lots of get up and go and is very attractive in style.  Driving is so comfortable one feels absolutely coddled and cuddled.  Daimler Chrysler has done it again!

I love the colors offered, the comfort of the ride, the ease of handling and the surge of power I feel when I give it a little gas.  

I hate the gas mileage of the Grand Cherokee, but it is better than most full sized SUVs on the market.  It was a little shocking after having driven the smaller Chryslers for the past 15+ years. I think I can stand the sacrifice in order to have the comfort.

Driving the Grand Cherokee I feel safe and very comfortable.  It is a much more secure feeling than smaller cars and SUVs.  Entry and exit are very easy.

I would recommend it to anyone, especially people with arthritis or chronic pain syndrome.  It is much less tiring than any other vehicle I have driven.  Also, as far as I am concerned there is no better ride on the market than  that of a Chrysler.<br><br>
