            The picture is very sharp and nice but it is a real battery killer. I think maybe there is something wrong with mine. I must take it to a store or send it in. It always give my message of the batteries are depleted. You can see some picture of it from your Atlantic regatta this summer at my briefcase in Yahoo, see the link at my profile. There is picture from it in album called Rec... Hope you enjoy, I just put in small ones so they are quicker at the net. The bigger ones I keep and if you want them, some shots or printed pictures send me mail. 

This camera comes with 8 Mb compact flash memory card, the bigger ones are quiet expensive, but worth to have. By best quality mode I can only take around 5-6 pictures at this 8 Mb card. But they are quiet good quality. The smaller format you can get much more picture even on the 8 Mb. card. I ones took around 60 when I was trying this camera out. 

There are cards available up to 64 and even seen around 120 Mb. But I remember to read something about slower work of the camera with bigger cards. 

There are also quicker way to download the pictures from the cam. Nice to have a reader or I seen even a small card adopter you but into the plug of the computer. Will be nice to try that out. But first I have to take mine to repair I thing there is something wrong with it. 

Buy your self a very good batteries and charger, this ones kills normal batteries, and alkaline as well.

But the pictures can be good, see samples at my briefcase, those in the album. Rec... are taken one this one. The link to my briefcase is at my profile.
