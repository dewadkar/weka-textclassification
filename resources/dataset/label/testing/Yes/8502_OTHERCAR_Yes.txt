            I am newcomer to digital photography and quite satisfied with this camera. This is an excellent digital camera, especially compared to others in its price range. 

The camera itself has an 3X optical zoom lens in addition to the digital zoom. It takes clear, colorful shots that transfer well to the PC and look great when printed.

After a quick look at the manual, I found myself easily taking pictures and downloading them to my PC. The LCD screen is crisp and clear, the menu screen is easy to navigate, the buttons are laid out well. The battery life is fine when taking pictures without the flash.  

The total package is what sold me on this product. It contained a 16mb smartcard, a USB cord to connect with my PC, rechargeable batteries with the charger, along with some good software as well. Plus there was a rebate, which gave me more incentive.

If you do some research, you will find that this camera is great for newcomers and veterans alike.
