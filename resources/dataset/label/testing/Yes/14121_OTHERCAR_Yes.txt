            This opinion may not make sense to a non-enthusiast.  This is coming from someone who views automobiles not as machines, but as entities.  Driving is not a chore, but an experience.  My, is a Dodge Viper an incredible experience.

I finally got to experience this lusty V10 Supercar in the form of my friend's 1997 Viper GTS.  (GTS is the Hardtop, RT/10 is the roadster).  This car was slightly better than an average Viper, due to an aftermarket air filter and exhaust.

When I was finally offered a ride in this vehicle of indescribable form and function, I jumped at the chance.  I felt that I was on top of the world, striding to the passenger seat of this incredible car.  I was the man... that is until I couldn't figure out how to open the door.  Someone then explained to me that there's a button on the window frame, and I was the man again, lowering myself into the surprisingly comfortable leather seat.

The exhaust note from this V10 monster is absolutely incredible.  The aftermarket exhaust on the car I was in had a lot to do with this.  If you're one of the people that loves the deep rumble of a large displacement engine, then this car will almost bring a tear to your eye.

The view from inside the Viper is truly a breathtaking sight.  You soon realize that every dip and flare in the enormous hood is truly a work of art.  The interior is quite practical.  Nearly everything adjusts manually; I'm told that power windows were not added until later in the 90's.  Both seatbelts pull down from the center, another thing I had trouble finding.

OK, now to the topic that everyone brings up first about the Viper: Performance.  It's true, the raw power of this vehicle is truly hard to describe.  At half-throttle your body is seemingly subjected to the g-forces dealt out by high-speed rollercoasters.  The body's reaction is the same every time:  The torso is pinned to the seat, right hand grips the handle as hard as possible, left hand grasps the seat, eyes bulge, and the face contorts into the widest, goofy-looking ear to ear smile in the world.

The only advice I can give is this:  If you know anyone with a Viper, get a ride.  If you can B.S. a dealer, test drive one.  If you can afford one, just go get it.<br><br>
