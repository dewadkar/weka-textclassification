            hey everyone, please do not waste your money on this car(mitsu eclipe gst or gsx) because it always mess up on my friend.  my friend bought a brand new mitsubishi eclipse gst and it has been like a year.  his car is in the shop more than the road.  the got this car and he thought this is the fast and reliable car.  he thought wrong because he spend money on fixing the head gasket, his car also ran on 3 cylinders at on point.  i was helping him put in an exhaust and the boult wont open and it broke.  trust me i am a machanic and i know bout car.  how about u go buy like an acura integra and you will be happy.<br><br>
