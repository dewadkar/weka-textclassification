            I was surprised when I started reading reviews and found low reviews for the Taurus. My Taurus is a few years older than the reviewers I was reading, and this may have a lot to do with it. My Taurus is a 1990 model. I bought it used, and it only had one owner, and she saved every piece of paperwork from everything that was ever done on that car, right down to oil changes. There has been very few repairs done to the car, and the car has really held up to Michigan winters (ice and salted roads mean rust). The car drives like a dream, and I truely enjoy taking it on the highway. 

I have tilt steering, and power windows, locks and everything else! I love this feature. I also love the fact that I can LOCK the windows from the front, so my daughter in the backseat can't open and close the window when I want it left shut. The seat adjusts up and down, and back and forth, so I can sit comfortably without having a pillow under me (I'm short!) 

If you are looking for a sports car, this car isn't for you. However, if you are looking for a comfortable family car, this may be for you! I know I love my car, and wouldn't trade it for the world! <br><br>
