            The digital camera revolution rolls on and it may have left this baby behind a little ways.  But in my opinion a 2 megapixel camera is just fine for almost all my shooting needs and I'm very happy with the DC 280.

I bought this camera after some exhaustive research; at the time it was definitely the best value for money I could find.  It came with a 20 MB memory card while most others came with just 8 and it's &quot;video out&quot; function was switchable between NSTC (america) and PAL (europe/australia).  I have family all over the world, so I wanted to be able to show pictures on anybody's TV - keep that in mind !!

You *definitely* need the rechargeable batteries that come with it - it's the same with almost all digicams.  Try not to use the screen on the back except to look at your pictures after you've taken them. It's the #1 power drain in the system.

I find the colors and image quality to be just great, esp. for a 2 m.pixel camera.  All the reviews at the time gave the DC280 top marks for it's image quality, though it's probably been surpassed by later models by now.

I have had a great deal of trouble with the software when I tried to use the serial port to transfer pictures.  My computer would completely lock up, or the camera couldn't be connected to...argh !! Thank grief the USB option is faster and much more reliable.

I took this camera on my honeymoon through Europe with a 15, 20 and 48 MB card.  In six weeks I only just filled them up, and I took plenty of hi-res pictures.  I definitely prefer Compact Flash based cameras (like the DC280) to the alternative Smart Media cameras, which use thinner, but more expensive cards that have less capacity.

With all that said, my camera does have a problem; all the pictures it takes are solid white, unless I use the backscreen to preview the image before I take it...something is wrong and it needs to be serviced, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

I'd buy this camera if you're content with an auto-everything, snapshot kind of camera.  You don't have control over things like exposure, shutter speed etc, but most of us don't need those things anyway.<br><br>
