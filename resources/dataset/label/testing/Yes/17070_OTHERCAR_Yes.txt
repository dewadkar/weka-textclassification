            This is another one of those family sedans with a kick butt engine and amazing handling.  It is technically classified as a luxury sedan, but should be classified as a sport sedan.  I took this car to my mother's house and to get there you have to take this 2 lane country road.  And I let this sucker loose.  at one point it looked like no car could make this one corner,  but sure enough the thing flew past it without a hitch.  It comes with anti-lock brakes and one of hte best suspension systems I have ever seen in a sedan.  It gets around those corners so fast its amazing.  And lets not forget the powerplant v6 its got sittin under the hood with over 200 horse power on thier 4 wheel drive system (getting it quite good accel.  But dont expect to get the wheels to chirp with a full time all wheel drive system.  But thats the only problem you will face in this monster of a &quot;family sedan&quot; priced at base at $25k all the way to $36k.<br><br>
