            My '96' Yukon SLT 4x4 has been nearly perfect.  I take great care of my vehicles and it pays off.  I have been taking it to the dealer for the recommended periodic maintenance since I bought it new in April of 96.  At 45,000 miles I replaced the front brake pads.  The only REPAIR was a faulty radiator cap and a leaking C/V joint.  Both covered by the warranty.

It now has 49,000 miles and runs great -- still on the original tires with at least 10K more miles left in them.  I have gotten consistently higher than rated fuel economy at 15.4/MPG local driving and 18.5/MPG highway.

The Cons are: 
1)The size and support of the seats.  I'm 6'5&quot; and 250 lbs. and long trips make for a sore seat.
2)Rear wheels have drum brakes.  Newer models have 4 wheel disk brakes.<br><br>
