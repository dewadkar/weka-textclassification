            Why did I buy a Acura Vigor?
I absolutely love to drive; so, of course the better a car responds, handles, and communicates the feel of the road back to it's driver, the better I like it.  I also knew I would be having a child soon, so I wanted 4 doors.  After driving every car that met my criteria, I found that the vigor was a &quot;Hit the ball out of the park home run winner from Acura!&quot;.
What do I love about this car? 
Perfect reliability, I have yet to have one problem after 7 yrs and 70k miles, not a thing, no rattles, no squeaks, even the  brakes are original. I also love the power.  There are very few cars, if any, that have 4 doors, that can keep up with a Vigor when it comes to passing acceleration. (In the $30,000 range) I believe Acura under-rated the hp, so as too, not up-stage the Legend.
What is it like to drive this vehicle ?
The Vigor communicates the road back to the driver extremely well.  You  drive with a confidence Non Vigor drivers will ever know.  The Vigor makes everything you do predictable, even slippery roads are un-eventful.
Who Should buy this vehicle ?
Anyone that can get their hands on one.  Good Luck !! Vigor owners know a good thing, and used ones go fast!
Who should not buy this car ?
People that need to carry adults in the back seat regularly, and people that must have built in cup holders.
Just a thought:
This car must be pretty well built if the customers biggest complaint is the lack of cup holders.
