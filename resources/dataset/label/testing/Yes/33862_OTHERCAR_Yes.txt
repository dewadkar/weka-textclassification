            When our son moved into the "big leagues" of minor hockey it was time to get out of our much loved Ford Taurus and into a van. We needed something that could handle the long Canadian winter road trips in British Columbia & Alberta. It also had to handle 2 parents 1 hockey player, and often another hockey player, and often 2 very large hockey bags, and what seemed like a mountain of luggage and coolers of food(hockey players eat alot).

I was very lucky to find this van on the lot. It had not even been looked at by the dealership yet as the former owners were in signing a deal on a new vehicle. It was owned by an elderly couple who looked after it very well. It actually still smelled new and that was in 2000 when we bought it.

It has been an awsome vehicle and served us extremly well. I would even say it is the best vehicle we have ever owned. The only problem we have ever had with it is the CD player now jams. Don't know what to do about it as you can't seem to buy a new one off the shelf that would fit it. It would have to be a dealer component, and I'm not spending that kind of money for factory stereos. The only other problem we ever had was last winter when the PCV valve froze in Alberta but that might have had something to do with it being -38C. The dealership I went into knew just what the problem was and was able to fix it in about 30 minutes with some foam insulation and a good bath to get rid of the oil that had sprayed all over the engine. We love our van and hope that even though our son has moved on in his hockey life, we won't have to get rid of it.
