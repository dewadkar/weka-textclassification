            I've owned numerous Saabs over the years, from my first 99GL to several 900 Turbos and even an 'ol '96. Over the past 2 years, I've been passively looking to buy a new car, and almost strayed from the Saab brand because after driving their newest heavier, more refined offerings, I was left with the feeling they had strayed from their roots, and were no longer the quirky, fun to drive, torquey front wheel drive cars that had drawn me to their previous products. That is, until I drove the 9-3 Viggen.

The Viggen is simply awesome. It's got all the attributes that attracted me to Saabs in the first place -- plus the added bonuses of a) having tons of torque and power (yippee) and b) looking hot as hell! It's a total blast to drive - even after nearly five months of ownership I look forward to every opportunity to get behind the wheel. It's a tame, easy driver when you need it to be, but when you stomp on the gas (WHOOSH - SCREECH!!!) off you go just like a lightning bolt (which is incidentally what 'Viggen' means in Swedish).

If you've read the trade rags, some auto journalists felt there was too much torque and as a result, too much torque steer. I totally agree, there is torque and torque steer but it's exactly that torque which makes this car so much fun. Basically, if you are looking for a car that will allow you to mindlessly float from your driveway to your destination, this is NOT the car for you. However, if you savor the driving experience, and the connection between the road, man and machine, then you will be completely exhilarated about the driving experience provided by the 9-3 Viggen.

Now given all this fun, you'd think there MUST be some major drawbacks, right? Well, I'd be lying if I said the car was perfect. First off, it's very low, which means even the most careful drivers will occasionally hear the sound of a gut-wrenching scrape as your front air-dam says hello to one of the many curbs and parking lot barriers found throughout the course of day-to-day driving. Also, if you buy the 3-door hatchback, you should know you're essentially buying a 2 seater. It wouldn't be so bad if the back seats we're simply small and uncomfortable, but getting to them requires an act of congress since the front seat side bolsters get in the way of the travel path when you fold the front seat forward to access the back. The only way for a full-sized adult to get in the back is to use the power seat adjust and move the front seat all the way forward, then fold the seat forward and get in. Getting out requires you to repeat that process. If I were buying now, I would definitely consider the 5-door.

However, those are small prices to pay for such driving bliss. All in all, if you're looking for a high performance sedan that breaks the M3 mold, then you should run to your local Saab dealer and test drive a 9-3 Viggen today!
