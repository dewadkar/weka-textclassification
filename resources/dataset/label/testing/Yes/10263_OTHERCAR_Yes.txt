            If there is anything I know, it would be the Nissan Sentra. I have owned three. My first car was a 1990 Nissan Sentra. I was nineteen. I have to admit I didn't shop around, nor did read Car and Driver, so I did not know much about the history of the Sentra. All I knew is that I was buying a four year old car so I didn't have the HIGHEST expectations. I needed a car to take me back and forth to work and school. My expectations were soon surpassed. The Sentra not only provided me with great transportation it lasted me for over three years. I feel confident that it would have given me more years, however, I was involved in an accident and had to say goodbye to my Sentra.  

With the insurance settlement I shopped around for another car. I knew that I needed to find a reliable car and fast for work. I was not going to buy anything else but a Sentra. I settled for a 1987 Nissan Sentra. It looked identical to my 1990. I didn't feel as if I was taking a step backward buying an older model. I felt I was very familiar with the Sentra. It drove very smooth, the air conditioning worked great, and the engine was very strong. I was not disappointed with my decision. I drove the '87 for one year, when I decided I would treat myself to a newer car. 

I did shop around this time, for I would be investing a little more money. I test drove the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord, the Kia Sephia, the Chevy Cavilier, but I kept coming back to the Sentra. I checked Kelly Blue Book and Car and Driver and I found that for the price and features the Sentra was very highly recommended. It was roomy enough for my two kids, and very fun to drive. So I made the final decision, and stood by what I knew. The Nissan Sentra.

I recommend the Sentra for anyone who likes compact cars. It is not a huge vehicle with a huge amount of leg room, maybe for anyone over 6ft tall. (Brother is 6'2&quot; and has a hard time driving my Sentra) But it is great for school, work, and commuting the kids back and forth. I would not recommend the Sentra for larger families. The back seat fits 2 comfortably, but three is a little snug. I would recommend the Sentra for small families perhaps as a second vehicle. The Sentra is also great on gas for those long road trips.

So whether your shopping for that first car or perhaps the family vehicle I would highly recommend the Nissan Sentra. It is both reliable and practical for the pocketbook.  <br><br>
