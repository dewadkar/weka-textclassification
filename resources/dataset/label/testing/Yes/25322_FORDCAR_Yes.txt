            I'm an American...and I make no apologies. I've always loved American cars, especially Fords. My first car was a 1966 Mustang which I got when I was 16, nearly 10 years ago...I still own that car.

When I graduated college, and moved to a larger city where the trials and tribulation and FUN of driving a mustang became silly, I started looking for my next car. My rules were simple. I wanted it to be fast, I wanted it to have Rear Wheel Drive, And I didn't want it to be a sports car. Above all, it had to be American made. This basically left 2 options these days...The discontinued Chevy Impala SS and the Ford Thunderbird V8. The T-Birds were cheaper, and made by my favorite, Ford...so the first car I bought for myself was a 1997 Ford Thunderbird, 4.6L V-8, Laser Red.

I had experience with T-Birds, as my Dad once owned an '87, and my sister's first car was an '86. But while this one is just one generation older, this latest iteration(discontinued in '97) puts its predecessors to shame. The styling is gorgeous. When you see this car for the first time, you realize the beauty it truly encapsulates. When you sit in the seats, they hold you solidly, but not intrusively(like &quot;racing&quot; style seats found in most sporty cars) My arm fell onto the console perfectly, and my hand landed right on the Automatic Shifter. As if the car was designed for me.

My 6'5&quot; 350LB frame was accommodated perfectly...something we tall fat guys aren't used to. Then came the test drive. I was amply impressed by the power. Being a motor head, I've driven and ridden in MUCH faster cars, but considering what this car is, it's amply powered...and easily upgraded should the need arise. The Independent Rear Suspension allows the car to handle through turns much better than an American car of this size would be expected. The power steering is tight enough to give me enough feed back to keep the car pointed exactly where I want, and the brakes allow me to keep myself out of most dangerous situations.

I am able to soundly defeat most the Hondas, V-6 Mustangs and Camaros that I meet on the line...though, I admittedly will be spanked by Anything more than a GT mustang, as my car weighs more than the equally powered Stangs.

Expect 1/4 mile times in the Low to Mid 16's. By no means phenomenal, but fast enough for commuting in the big city, and allowing me to pick where in the traffic flow I am.

The only problem I've had yet is with a known failure in the Intake Manifold. Most 4.6 Litre Ford engines have this same flaw. The Plastic intake manifold will crack, spilling Coolant everywhere.

When I had this failure, Ford covered the 600 dollar repair bill, and paid the towing charges, no questions asked. They, however, will not repair the problem until the car leaves you stranded. Be aware of this!

I wish the car came with Ford's Manual 5 Speed transmissions they put in the Mustangs, but the EOD Automatic Overdrive in this car is fine, and allows me to manually hold out gears to give me enough pull through turns, and immediate acceleration when I need it. When left in drive, the Tranny helps keep the gasoline bills lower, even if I feel it sometimes will slip into a higher gear WAY too early. 

Anti-Lock Brakes would also come in handy.

The basic deal is I drive the MESS out of all cars I get my hands on. This one has withstood my abuse quite nicely.

If you want the more refined modern sports coupe, 2-door like the BMW M3s you probably won't be happy with this thing...but if you're American at heart(when it comes to cars), and your local climate can accommodate the rear wheel drive, and lack of ABS, this would be a great car to test drive.
