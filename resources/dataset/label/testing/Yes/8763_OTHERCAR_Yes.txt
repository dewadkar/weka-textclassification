            I drive a silver 2001 Toyota Echo (I am NOT going to call it an ECHO). I bought it used, but it's still the newest car I've ever owned. It had less than 25,000 miles on it when I bought it at CarMax.

Overall, I would have to say that I'm very happy with my Echo. Its pros definitely outweigh its cons. I'll write about both.

First the bad news:

The car is not powerful. Of course, I don't think anyone who takes a look at it could possibly imagine that it would be. It's especially sluggish in the morning, when I'm racing to get to work.

The car does not offer a quiet ride. 

The car - at least the model I have - doesn't have power mirrors or locks. I am constantly reminding passengers to push down the *!#@$! lock before they close the door.

And this is minor - and could just be a fault of my car and my car alone. The *$!$%@! CD player skips - A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT.

The console set-up, which is in the center of the dashboard, rather than in front of the steering wheel, takes an awful lot of getting used to.

Now the good news:

My car gets 41 miles to the gallon on the highway! I used to drive a 1991 Toyota Tercel, and whenever I would drive from High Point back home to Knoxville, Tenn., I had to fill up the tank again before I reached Asheville (for those not familiar with North Carolina geography, that's a distance of less than three hours). Now I make it all the way to Knoxville on half a tank! In the city, it's also quite good - getting close to 25 miles per gallon.

My car handles like a dream. I can whip into any parking space, whether I'm pulling in straight or parallel parking.

My wife says the seats aren't comfortable after several hours of driving, but I disagree. I think my Echo is one of the most comfortable cars I've ever driven.

The car lacks some power options, but it does have the ones that really count: power steering, brakes, automatic transmission - even cruise control.

The car's heating and cooling systems are great. They heat up (or cool down) quickly. The defroster - front and rear - gets ice off the windshield in record time.

For a small car, the Echo is surprisingly roomy.

And even though the CD player skips, the car's sound system is great, featuring six speakers that give you a wonderful surround-sound experience.

Bottom line: I love my Echo. I would recommend it to anyone who wants an economical, low-maintenance car. This is not a luxury automobile, but then, you probably wouldn't be reading this review if that were what you're in the market for.
