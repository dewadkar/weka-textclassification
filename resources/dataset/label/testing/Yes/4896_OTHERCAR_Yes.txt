            The Sony DSC-P1 is a beautiful, elegant, and sophisticated digital camera. It has a sleek, anodized body which feels good, though somewhat weighty, to carry. While the package does not include a carrying case, there is a hand-strap which functions admirably.

The DSC-P1 includes a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that last a LONG time! This fact is one great improvement over the last line of digital cameras such as the Kodak DC240 which used rechargeable AA's and took all of 15 pictures before going dead.

Installation is a snap with software and USB support. However, I personally don't like having to connect my camera to the computer, and eventually the USB chain will start having difficulty after about 10 devices. The transfer rate from USB Camera port is somewhat slow too. Instead, I purchase the Sony Memory Stick Reader USB and just pop the Memory stick in and out to transfer photos. You can even save Word documents on the Memory Stick this way!

The DSC-P1 takes AMAZING photographs. The 3.3Megapixel capture is really astounding and creates <b> huge</b> 1.5MB JPG files. These are readily resized in any software, such as Microsoft Photo Editor down to 50-150K with no loss of clarity. If you would like an example, please cut and paste this link: http://www.geocities.com/dsg210/kcolewatch.jpg
Of course, at 1.5MB you will realize that 8MB holds only 5 pictures. So you will need to spend another $100 to get a 64MB Memory Stick, though Sony is currently offering a $50 rebate if you buy both the camera and a memory stick. I suggest buying it from <b> Ecost.com</b> which at the moment has the cheapest price around.

Other features include: Black & White, Sepia, Polarize, Negativize, Time & Date Stamp, Flash, Back-Fill, Macro/Close-Up. LCD on/off with standard viewfinder.

One other main feature, I should mention is the "movie" capture which can capture up to 1-5 minutes of full motion video with sound. The resolution is not that great, nor the sound quality but its a neat function. When compared to Sharp's VNEZ1U Internet Viewcam, the Sony bests is with no effort AND you have a 3.3Megapixel camera, while the former can only take photos at 320x180.

A few lacking features: Timed Exposure, Adjustable Shutter Speed for night vs. day vs action pictures, quick shutter release (as stated in other epinions, this process takes about 1-3 sec and the scene can change rapidly.) (I had serious trouble photographing my niece because the photo opportunities changed much more quickly than the camera could take pictures.)

Accessories inlcude tripod, <b> Underwater Casing</b> (I'd love to get one of those for some Scuba pictures), Memory Sticks, MS Readers, carrying case.

As with most expensive technology, its hard to find one that does it ALL right, but the Sony DSC-P1 has a mother-load of excellent functions and qualities. These more than make up for it's short-comings, but you need to be aware of them, as unfortunately, I was not. Overall, I am very happy with the camera and consider it to be a worthwhile upgrade over my last one.
