               I am a true gadget buff, and if it is one thing I know, within a week after buying a new &quot;electronic toy&quot; I will either feel good about making the purchase, or I will feel totally wit-deficient.
   Fortunately, with the Kodak DC-215 I did not feel either of those emotions in the week following my purchase. In fact, it has now been almost 8 weeks, and i am still callous. 
   It takes good quality pictures, even on the lowest resolution setting. And it takes great pictures on the highest setting. The reason I invested in the Kodak DC-215 was because I have a web-based business creating custom greetings for individuals and small businesses. 
   Taking a picture on a conventional camera and developing the film (sometimes a roll to obtain only 2 or 3 photos) was not financially wise.
   I did research on digital cameras and balancing what i needed with what was on the market, I chose the Kodak DC-215. 
   I needed to be able to create quality photos worthy of printing or posting on websites. This camera is easy to understand and has a small learning curve, if any. The menu which conveniently pops up on the lcd screen is easy to read in natural light as well as inside, and the software provided with the camera is more than adequate for retrieving the files from the camera.
    I must stress using the lithium batteries, and plan on purchasing the AC adapter from Kodak for around $45.00. Using regular batteries will only get you 6 to 12 photos with the flash. The lithium batteries will get you 34 to 44 with the flash. Keep the AC adapter near your computer and utilize it each time you go to retrieve your photos from your camera. This will also conserve battery life.
    Overall, it is a solid piece of equipment which is easy to understand and completes each task which I assign to it.<br><br>
