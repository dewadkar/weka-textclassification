            The Saturn my brother owns is great.  He bought it new in 1997 and hasn't had any problems with it so far.  It is very comfortable and relatively roomy.  And the engine sounds great.  He said he had little problem buying it also.  This is a big point for me after dealing with car salesmen at various times in my life.  Customer service is a huge issue for me and if a company has poor relations, then it is hard for me to do business with them no matter how good or cheap their products are.  

When I drove it, the handling was very receptive.  I am far from a skilled stick-shift driver, but this car was easy for me to use.  It responded well around turns and the shocks/brakes were great.  It is definitely in the top 5 next time I buy or lease a car. <br><br>
