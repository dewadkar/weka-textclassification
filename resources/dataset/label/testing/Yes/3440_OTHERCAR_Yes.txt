            This sporty, semi-luxury car offers a lot of bang for the buck; its options and equipment are comparable to much-higher priced imports (for example, BMW and Audi), yet its purchase price is MUCH lower.  Not only that, but this car comes with the Honda performance and repair reputation, which, as any one who has owned a Honda knows, are not only superb, but are also priced below the competition�s.

Where do I start with my CL?  I guess with the many luxury features, although I will stop short of a full synopsis of specifications, which you can get on the Acura website.  Instead, I will highlight the features that are meaningful to me as an owner of the car/user of the features.  First, the car comes equipped with high-grade leather.  Leather is pretty standard these days, but it is very nice, very soft, leather, my only complaint being that the pale tan color dirties easily.  The CL has automatic everything, remote lock/unlock and truck features, a smallish (due to the size of the roof) sunroof (or is it a moonroof? whichever is glass with interior cover), tight steering radius, fancy wheels, a 3.2 liter engine, 225 horsepower, an electronic steptronic transmission (which allows you to switch over to an electronic manual transmission, originated I believe with the Porsche Boxster), heated seats and mirrors, extremely ergonomic instrumentation, and (I�ll stop here) an in-dash 6-CD changer.  Not bad, for a $30,000 sticker price!  

[Addition Dec. 28: I forgot to mention when I originally wrote this the following: (1) I love love love the power slide-up seats.  They are motorized, such that when you flip them up for access to the rear, they slowly motor all the way forward, permitting the fullest access to the rear with the greatest of ease.  Flip the seat back to the upright position, and the seat quietly motors back to where it is supposed to be.  I adore this feature, and my guests always adore it, too.  It is a feature which takes the edge off of having a 2-door car.  (2) In honesty, though, I have to add an aspect of the car that I DON'T like, and that's horn placement.  It is buried within the middle of the steering wheel, with no button or anything, and is fairly hard to activate.  This can have effects ranging from mildly annoying to dangerous.  Five months later, I still cannot activate the horn without really searching and trying hard.]

The Bose stereo is particularly nice, which is noteworthy when you know that ALL of the competition charges you extra for anything above an unacceptable basic system.   The stereo utilizes standard &quot;knob&quot; controls, as well as volume and channel controls on the steering wheel.  I have grown to really like the steering-wheel-based controls, and highly recommend them.  An in-dash CD changer is, of course, almost unheard of.  The sound is good.  It is not like the sound of so many music buffs� cars, which are loaded with woofers and tweeters and amps and such.  The sound is simply somewhere between �good� to �very good�.  The features of the stereo are great, offering not just a CD player but a tape player as well, and 12 FM/6 AM presets.  You can toggle between these, and each unit will �remember� where you were on the CD or tape while you check traffic or whatever.  I really like this flexibility.

The only factory option for the CL is the Navigation System, which we call the �Navi�.  I went with the Navi primarily because it�s really cool.  When you first use it, it is fairly mindblowing, although to see it, it feels so natural and like something that we have all imagined in �cars in the future� for a long time.  It works superbly, and for me, being only 2 years in this area, it has been a tremendous help in getting around to new places, or getting between places I know when it requires me to go through places I don�t.  In some ways, the Navi has truly changed my life for the better.  Now, when I have a hankerin� for a particular restaurant but am in a strange place, I simply punch it up on the Navi, and wait for my instructions.  The instructions are displayed on the in-dash 3.5� computer screen, but are also spoken as you approach each segment of the journey.  You can repeat the voice instructions at any time, or turn them off.  You can choose many alternate methods to traveling, or, you can ignore what you are given if you know a particular area better than the Navi, and the Navi will simply recalculate the best way to go from the new location at which it senses you.  I could write a whole review on just the Navi � which I adore � but I will stop here and let those of you who are tempted test drive for yourself.

I have had the CL about five months now, long enough to have become familiar enough with it to REALLY talk to someone else about how it performs.  Some practical issues I have run into are first, a small gas tank.  While this eases the pain of each individual refueling, it increases the frequency of same.  The mileage is so-so, about 20 mpg.  The car requires premium fuel, so if you are not used to paying for this upgrade, given current oil prices this may not be the time to try to adjust.  Also, while I think the car generally has great pick-up, I have, most unfortunately, been nearly blown off the road by a BMW.  This was not something I expected with my big engine and dual-exhaust.  In fact, I want to be the one doing the blowing off.  It is easy to blow off, say, a Ford Escort but the other higher-end cars on the road are not easy prey.

The car includes a �seat memory� feature for two drivers, so that each driver�s seat and mirror locations can be cued simply by using their own remote control to unlock the car.  I understand other luxury cars actually offer a little more in this department: the memory includes the precise temperature preferred by the driver.  So Acura does not quite measure up to the competition in this department.  Speaking of temperature, the car does NOT have dual zone temperature control, and falls a little short of the competition on this issue as well.

The car rides very well, sits fairly low and provides excellent visibility, with the exception of the fairly large rearview mirrors.  At first, they tend to kind of stand out as a visibility inhibitor, probably because they are just about the ONLY visibility inhibitor on this car.  The engine is VERY quiet, but the roadnoise is louder sometimes than I think it should be.  Some other design flaws: no partial mudflaps, or other shield to keep the tires from throwing so much dirt onto the car.  This is a Honda problem I think, because my Volvo had these small shields that stuck out slightly from the wheel well, and I never had that dirt-spinning look on the Volvo that I get on the Acura and got on my Civic.  Forces you to get the car clean more often.  Also, for some reason, including probably the height of the seats, the angle of the doorway and the placement of the �pockets� at the bottom of the doors seems to cause a great deal of shoe contact and resulting scuffing with the door panel. If your interior is black, this may not matter, but with my tan interior it is a REAL pain, and the scuffs do not entirely come out of the plastic, at least not with anything I have tried so far.  The lack of tire shields and this door problem are my two biggest complaints about the car.

The trunk is very large, and is also easy to access.  I noted on other cars I test drove that trunk design has changed, and some of the luxury cars offer decent-ish trunks with very odd-shaped openings that made them look harder to use.  This trunk has a very spacious opening and plenty of floor area for storage.  The car comes with the cargo net, which has two positions in which it can be used.  I find the two positions to offer the equivalent of �small� and �large� trunk space, which is only a problem when you need �medium� to keep contents from shifting.  

The look of the car is, I think, still to be refined a little.  The car is very similar looking to the Toyota Camry Solara.  While I do not generally prefer a spoiler, the rear end of this car is bad, and really and truly needs the spoiler.  With the spoiler, it looks very sporty, and has the Acura �flair� reminiscent of the Integra, but with a more refined and updated look.  The front and rear windows are VERY sloped, giving the car a sleek look and great visibility, but also giving the window-cleaner a very hard time.  

All in all: I like the car.  I LOVE Honda performance and reputation, which is what helped bring me to this car.  It certainly offers more luxury and performance than any Honda currently on the market, providing the �next step up� while preserving the Honda performance hallmarks.  Due to the various small shortcomings I describe above, the CL has not succeeded, yet, in truly matching luxury cars in all details, but it does offer a tremendous bang for the buck, considering the extra cost the competition will charge to install the many features which are simply standard on the Acura.  <br><br>
