            After hearing many great reviews about this car, I decided to purchase it.  I was going to get the Audi, but the Acura seemed to have an overall advantage.  So far it is working perfectly.  It has been incredibly dependable, only requiring one check out so far, and things were running great for it.  The leather interior allows for a most comfortable ride; it is very fitting for long trips.  As you drive the car, you feel as if you have complete control over the vehicle, making it extremely safe.

However there is one problem we got when buying this car.  We got the smaller engine of the two that were avalable.  This was a huge mistake.  The car simply doesn't have enough &quot;oumf&quot;  Get this car if you want a new car, but make sure you get the more powerful engine.<br><br>
