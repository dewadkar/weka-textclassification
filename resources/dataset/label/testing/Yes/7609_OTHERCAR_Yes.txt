            when you own a honda, you find there is no other car like it on the market. For starters there is the reliability! repair cost are very low(that is if you even need a repair) the honda prelude is a sporty, economical car that is reasonably priced. The handling and performance of this car is perfect, and to sit in the seats is a rush as you open up the throttle! the dash cluster is very well placed and spread across the whole dash( just where you need them )driving is a pleasure as you drive down the road, sunroof open, listining to music on the six speaker sound system. This car is for anyone who loves to drive! <br><br>
