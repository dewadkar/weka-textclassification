            I recently purchased the Sony Mavica 83.  I was torn between the Kodak and the Sony.  I used my friend's Kodak for a few days and tried to download the pictures onto my PC and was having a great deal of difficulty.  I then asked my friend to print them out on his computer.  Well, after watching him try to get these pictures out of this camera, with very little ease, I made up my mind immediately on the Sony.  I consider myself extremely computer literate and I was very frustrated with the Kodak.  My office had purchased a Sony and I tried it out.  The difference was amazing.  With the Sony, all you do it put a floppy in the camera, take it out, and put it in any PC that's available -- that's it.

I've tried several other digital cameras that friends of mine have.  The Sony is by far the most convenient and easiest to use.  The pictures are of top quality and you can use anybody's PC to view them.  There are no wires, adapters, extra software, etc. to worry about.  People who are not so computer literate will find this camera extremely user-friendly.

I purchased the Epson Stylus printer to print out the pictures.  That too is great.
