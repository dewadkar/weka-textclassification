            We wanted to buy a cheap new car, but did not know where to begin.
We had never bought a new one before, we had only been able to afford used cars, so we were pretty excited about it.  My dad and my older sister both owned Neons and both said that it was the best cheap car they had ever owned.  So we decided to check out the Neon's.
To make a long story short, we ended up with a brand new 1999 Plymouth 2 door Highline Neon.
We just love our little car.  We havent had to take it to the shop yet and so far it doesnt have any problems that might warrant a trip to the shop.
We think that Plymouth Neon's are the best cheap car you can buy.
It is not only cheap but also reliable.
Our only complaint would be that the trunk is not big enough, or at least its not big enough for us.
Our Neon is the only vehicle that we own, so we drive it everywhere.  Even to Canada (from Oregon).  The seats were always comfortable and the ride was smooth. 
I would definitely recommend that others buy this car if they are looking for a cheap and reliable buy.<br><br>
