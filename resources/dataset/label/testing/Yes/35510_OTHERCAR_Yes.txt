            Love it!  We tried all the others, and this is the best on the market.
We�ve driven full size conversion vans since 1987, and find this mini to be a very fine improvement in gas mileage, comfort, handling, and noise.  The interior space is not all that bad either.
We took delivery in August 1999 after a three month wait for delivery.  Had to buy on reviews and Honda reputation only, since they are in such short supply you can�t find one to drive.  We were able to see one and sit in it at an auto show last spring.  Once it got here, it turns out to be everything we had hoped for.
For the small ($3000) difference in price, we ordered the EX.  For this you get roof rails, alloy wheels, center front fold-a-way tray table, steering wheel audio control, climate control rear A/C and electric sliding side doors.  Quite a bargain in our opinion.

Pro:
 Excellent turn radius, turns as tight as our 98 Toyota Camry
 Very stabile, even in wind and rain, better than anything we�ve driven in the last 30 years
 Low to the ground makes access easier for our crippled son to get into and out.  Much better accessibility than my brothers 98 Town and Country or the back seat of our 98 Camry
 Climate control has individual adjustments for back seat passengers
 Rear seat folds into the floor, allowing us to travel with the German Shepherd in her kennel and all the luggage space we can imagine needing
 Having that rear seat with us, allows a very easy re-configuration to take up to six passengers
 The drag coefficient must be very low since we don�t collect near the bugs that we�ve collected on any other vehicle
 Cloth interior and colors and are luxurious
Con:
 Not ugly, but not as handsome as the Chryslers
 Tilt wheel doesn�t come toward the lap as we are used to
 Limited exterior color choices
 The electric sliding side doors are a great convenience, however Honda may have a safely issue with them.  They do not stop or reverse as they should when a person is in the way
