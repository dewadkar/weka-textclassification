            There is one and only one reason I didn't buy a gorgeous triple black Camaro SS convertible, I found a Corvette convertible before the paperwork was done.

They call me Motor Head for very good reasons.  If it's a sports car or classic muscle car, I know it inside and out.  I have written several reviews recently on sports cars for three reasons.

1.  I know and love cars

2.  I finally was able to buy my dream car

3.  I thoroughly test drove the competition and want to pass on the       knowledge.

Before I get into the meat of my review, let me tell you how I test drive a car.  Forget the stereo, that's the least of my worries, I test the stereo last.  If the car has the typical 1/99th tank of gas, I tell the salesmonkey to get a gas voucher.  We are going to be gone at least an hour.  The poor soul who sells me a car is going to earn his commission.

Ok, enough gas, radio off, off we go.  Back streets, side streets, traffic, highway and lots of backroad corners.  If the passenger seat isn't soiled by the end of the test drive, I haven't done my job.  Let's cut to the chase, I can tell you more from a good test drive than most people who have owned their cars for a year.  Yup, I'm that serious about sports cars.

I came so close to buying this car that I actually, for the first time in my life, apologized to the saleman.  I had a friend doing a net search for just the right Corvette convertible.  I had been looking for well over a month and there just wasn't one available.  I've always liked the SS, and figured that if a convertible were available I would be happy for a long darn time with that. Well I found this triple black SS convertible before my friend found my Corvette convertible.

There is not one single thing wrong with this car.  It is far and away the finest Camaro to ever leave the factory.  SS stands for Super Sport, but it might just as well mean &quot;Simply Stupendous&quot;  The only difference I can draw between the SS and a Corvette convertible is the admittedly small back seat.  Many of the body pieces are composite (plastic for the simple of mind) and the only possible improvement I can think of for this car would be the Corvette independent suspension rear end. 

The SS has the Corvette LS1 engine, the Corvette Tranny, whether stick or automatic, but a solid rear axle.  Given that it's a classic muscle car, I can forgive it that very, very small shortcoming.  Besides, if you know how to throw a car around correctly, a straight axle vs. independent system is really only going to make a difference to a pro.  99.9999% of people who buy cars would not be able to scrape out that last bit of performance from the independent rear axle.

Ok, so here's the nitty gritty.  This is a smokin' fast car.  I'm telling you this car has more grunt than a grizzly bear.  If such language were used among these pages, I would tell you in muscle car language exactly how fast this car is.  If you go head to head with somebody from a dead stop, start off in second and dump the clutch at three grand on the tach.  If you're in first and you stomp it, the only thing your going to do is shred your tires.  Yup, it's that fast.

Now if you talk to GM, the Firebird TransAm, WS6 package (the SS clone in Pontiac clothes) is the same car with a different skin.  T'aint true, no sir.  That's yet another review.  BUT...  the SS is sprung tighter than an overwound pocket watch.  You can throw this car through a corner sideways, crank in a bit of counter steer at the apex, stomp the throttle and you are flat gone.  That's the straight axle in the back.  My Corvette takes a tad more finess because it grips a tad tighter.

Four enormous disc brakes will bring you to a screeching halt time after time with barely a hint of fade.  Of course, screeching is just an adjective because the ABS would prevent lockup, but you have to really stand on the brakes to get the ABS to kick in.  The brake and tire combo on the SS is every bit as good as the Corvette and a far sight better that any other car on the road.  Acura NSX you say?  Not a chance.  You know, I've noticed that foreign car fools throw around the NSX like it was some kind of miracle.  Hang it up guys, this car will smoke you like a cheap cigar.

The interior treatment is just right.  You get lots of nice appointments and power accessories, but it doesn't come off as a &quot;luxury sport coupe&quot;.  The interior is by no means &quot;Spartan&quot; or plain, is just isn't highly decorative.  It's just exactly what it should be.  No digital gauges here folks, this dashboard is all business.  Not too much, not too little.  No wonder Chevy is going to kill it off next year, it's just about perfect.

Lest I get too carried away, there are some ergonomic compromises, but if you are looking for a true muscle car, that comes with the territory.  The sacrifices to comfort are very few and truly unnoticeable unless you're doing a marathon drive.  Besides, you should get out every couple of hours anyway and stretch.  If you are an adult sitting in the back seat, you are probably the only one who will really notice any sacrifice of comfort to the performance gods.  The back is really only suited for kids.

With the top down, you really are in heaven.  Even the back seat is worth it for the open air ride.  The mechanism is hydraulic, so just unlock the front two latches and press the button.  The boot for the top takes a minute or two to put on, but they all do.  I lean towards the perfectionist side.  If you put the top down, put the boot on.  The added cleanliness to the overall appearance of the car is worth it.

Fit and finish on this car is wonderful.  GM has come a long, long way in that department.  The insulation in the top makes the enclosed ride so quiet you really never know you're in a rag top.  The growl from the exhaust and the finely tuned resonance from the intake are the finest in the GM line-up.  That's the one place the SS outperforms the Corvette.  The 'Vette is just too darn quiet.  The SS isn't loud in any offensive manner, it just is a joy to the ears.

Speaking of Joy to the ears, if you dare replace the Typhoon stereo system in this car you are simply wasting your money.  You would need a several thousand dollar aftermarket system to improve on what comes in this car.  Only at the maximum settings for volume AND bass do you get a hint of distortion.  If your ears can handle the pain of getting to that point, well, you must be a masochist.

I guess I should stop carrying on so about the SS, but it's hard.  It is a truly wonderful automobile.  If it hadn't been for a call on my cell phone I would have had one in my driveway.  I was literally waiting on paperwork from the sales manager when I got the call that My Corvette Convertible had been located.  Had THAT car been just the slightest bit less than perfect, this triple black beauty would have said SOLD!
