            I purchased my BMW325 about six months ago and have been extremely happy with the purchase.  The accolades are many and begin with the styling.  The car is sleek and has a sexy low profile.  Add in a leather interior and the functionally, yet stylish dashboard and you have a nice looking car.  Additionally, the paint jobs on BMW's are always well done and deep.

As far as how the car drives, ditto.  I could not ask for more!  The car handles very well and has a feature that provides for extra traction on wet roads (Not so good in snow, but I will cover that later.).  Steering is easy and the acceleration is everything that you would expect in a BWM.  The gears slide easily and something that is a little less noticeable, but important, is the positioning of the signals/cruise control/radio/etc.  They are positioned so that you really do not have to take your eye off of the road in order to make a change.  A nice feature.

The car also passes all the tests that I look for as far as safety is concerned.  The 325 comes with dual airbags and is relatively heavy.  Also has anti- lock brakes and as I mentioned earlier, the advanced steering control (ASC) system. 

Space is always a big consideration when dealing with a sporty automobile, but once again, the 325 passes the test. Plenty of leg room in the front and the back for all four occupants.  Headroom is plentiful.  And, finally, the trunk provides enough room for four sets of golf clubs.

The only complaint I have regarding the car is that it is very poor in the snow.  I am accustomed to driving in the snow since I have lived in Pennsylvania all of my life, however, this is one car that just does not want to move in snowy conditions.  I do my best to time lights and avoid hills when the roads are snow covered.  Also put extra weight in the trunk.  Does not matter.  Unfortunately, the ASC does not provide a lot of help when the roads are snow covered.  

All in all, I would suggest the BMW 325 to anyone who asks me about it.  Simply put, it is the best car I have owned and I have owned some pretty nice cars.  However, you may want to think twice if you are going to be driving it in areas where snow is a frequent visitor.  Which reminds me of one thing I forgot.  The heated seats are a dream!  They warm up quickly and are wonderful for the stiff back.<br><br>
