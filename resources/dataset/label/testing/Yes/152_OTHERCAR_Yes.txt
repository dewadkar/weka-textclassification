            I was preparing to leave for a cruise on Oct23 and I decided I wanted to bring a digital camera along.  A few things I looked for were very expandable picture storage, easy image transfer, high quality pictures, and a small portable size.

The Fuji MX-1200 met nearly all of my expectations, and beet a few of them.  The explandable SmartCard system allowed me to purchase a 16mb card which stores more pictures than you can imagine, even in fine mode.  (It includes a 2mb card which should be ample for most small trips with access to a notebook or computer.)  The image quality, in my experience, is incrible.  Beats my old Kodak DC110 which LCD died.  The size was a lot small than it looks in a picture.  It's as small or smaller then most regular cameras, but not akwardly small.

The big downside to the Fuji camera is that for it to be truly function and portable you really should by a Flashcard reader-  you simply insert your image card to a floppy disk device, put it in your drive, and read the images like they were on the disk- there are many advantages to this.  This system will cost you an extra $50 though.

Lastly, my Fuji didn't include a manual which slowed me down a bit.  Not sure if it was a packaging error or they just don't include manuals.  (Look of shock!)<br><br>
