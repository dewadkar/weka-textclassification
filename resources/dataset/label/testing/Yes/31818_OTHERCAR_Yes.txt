            I am an owner of a 2000 Honda Civic SE and although it is not a great car to look at, it is very reliable transportation.This is my third civic.The first I still have (91 hatchback) and serves well as our second car with over 200000 Km driven.I also had a 1998 EX sedan which I wrote off in a head on crash in October while driving on snow covered roads.I can say that the car is quite safe since I walked away unhurt and order my present car the next day.

My Civic handles very well both in Town and on the highway.I travelled from Nova Scotia Canada to New York city with a full car and a carrier on the roof and still had good power when needed.Fuel economy suffered during the trip due to the carrier on the roof and using the air conditioning but usually it is very good.

This car is very reliable and the local Honda dealership is very fair with me.I have driven a lot of other compact cars but the Civic sure does impress me.

The back seats do not allow a lot of leg room for adults and it some road noise at highway driving are only minor complaints for me.

This is a great compact car and I would buy again.
