            [Please note that this is a 2003 model -- the drop down list box did not offer 2003 as an option, so I selected 2002 instead]

Up till now, we've been a one-Lexus, one-something-else family.  The "something-else" for the last 5 years has been a Mercedes ML320.  Back in '98, we wanted to have an SUV in the family to handle the kids and all the associated luggage that goes along.  Lexus didn't offer anything that matched the size/price combination we were looking for, so we opted for the ML.  Big mistake, but hey, live and learn.

All the other Lexus we've had so far have been LS's (the latest being an LS430).  The quality and dependability of the LS's is what steered me towards Lexus when looking for an ML replacement.  Mercedes really hasn't done anything to fix their quality issues, the X5 is riddled with the usual BMW reliability issues, and the MDX hasn't been around long enough to really know how it'll do (although early indicators are not terribly favorable).  As safety and reliability are the leading requirements for any car I'd be interested in, it was looking pretty good for Lexus.

So which one?  The choices of RX, GX or LX are sufficiently differentiated, that it wasn't hard.  The RX is a great car-like SUV, but simply too small and under-featured.  The LX is too big, and way too expensive.  As the little bear said, the GX was "just right".

The list of goodies was familiar and deep enough to keep me happy -- Navigation, Mark Levinson, seating for 8, comfy seats (really comfy -- great for long trips), etc. etc.  The list of negatives was rather short: low gas mileage (14 vs. 18 in the ML) and a rear gate that doesn't swing up, but rather swings out (!) and to boot, swings out TOWARDS the curb.  Ugh.  What were they thinking?  Bad, yes, but not a deal breaker.

In the past 1,500 miles of ownership, it&#146s been through several serious New England snowstorms, and has handled extremely well.  I&#146ve had it back and forth to New York on the rather poorly maintained New York highways and had nothing to complain about.  Overall, it&#146s very well mannered, sufficiently powered to get out of it&#146s own way, and stable even in cross winds.

Visibility in the car is fabulous.  There are virtually no blind spots.  Being as high up as you are is a plus as well (although some would say the climbing up into the cab is a real workout).  

The cab is dead quiet (as good or better than the LS), which makes listening to the ML that much more enjoyable.

The navigation system is awesome (actually better than the LS).  There are dozens of new little features in the nav system that makes it a hoot to use.  You can set multiple destinations all at once, and the system will generate a route that takes you to each of them in sequence.  A real plus when you have to drive 5 little girls home from a birthday party.  It&#146s got memory galore for remembering where you&#146ve been (and getting you back there again).  It will also allow you to &#147play&#148 the route like a movie so you can watch it on the screen.

There&#146s a calendar built in to the system that allows you to store memos and reminders.  Pity they didn&#146t put an IR port in so you could synch your palm to it (maybe next year).

OK.  Now for a minor whine session.  None of these are major issues, and none of them would prevent me from re-making the decision to buy again, but they are annoying, and Lexus is in the &#147relentless pursuit of perfection&#148, so here&#146s some things they could work on.

1)	The armrest is too small, and too close in to the driver seat.  I like to lean on it while driving and hold the shift knob, and that&#146s just not a comfortable thing to do with the armrest positioned where it is.
2)	The &#147auto-close&#148 feature available on the LS430 for the doors and trunk is not available for the GX.  It should be.
3)	You cannot see the temperature that the interior is set to unless you press the &#147climate&#148 button and display it on the screen.  In the LS, it&#146s up on the LED display panel above the screen.  
4)	The additional computer functions (instant MPG, average MPG, barometer, altimeter, etc.) are located on the LED panel above the screen instead of on the dash.  Bad placement.
5)	The laser controlled cruise control is not available as an option.
6)	Lexus park assist is not available as an option.
7)	The disc changer is a magazine in the glove box instead of a continuous feed in the stereo itself.  Makes changing discs while you&#146re driving impossible.
8)	The side-view mirrors do not retract electronically when you park.  This is a bigger problem in the GX than it is in the LS, yet the LS has this feature and the GX doesn&#146t.
9)	The seats heat, but they don&#146t cool.  Hasn&#146t been a problem yet, but probably will be in the summer!

OK whine is done.  Mostly, there are just creature comfort tid-bits that I got used to having on the LS and now miss on the GX.  Guess I&#146ll have to get over it.

Overall, the GX has fully met my expectations, and exceeded a few as well.  If you&#146re in the market for a luxury SUV, like toys, like quiet and reliability, then the GX is the SUV for you.
