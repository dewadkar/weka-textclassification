            I bought my 1994 Mazda MX-3 (the V6 version with power windows and locks) 2 years ago and at the time it had 120k miles on it.  It's a 5 speed manual transmission and its only alteration is a new stereo system and CD player.  I was lucky enough to buy it from an owner who had kept records of all maintenance right down to the oil changes which she performed religiously every 3000 miles.  I've continued that pattern and now it's at 175k and still going strong.  For my purposes the car is great.  It definitely performs like a sports car - it runs at very high revs (60 mph is above 3500 RPM).  

PROS:
Gas mileage is respectable, I've been getting about 40 miles to the gallon.  It handles very well, and the V6 has a great "zippy" feel to it.  Also handles well in the rain - you can always feel the road and if you get into a skid you'll feel it very quickly. 
When you fold the backseat down there is tons of room in the hatchback - I've used mine to move materials for many a construction project.
Mine has required very little maintenance despite being a high-mileage car.  
I also have to give the interior design a thumbs up for storage - lots of room to put your drinks and trinkets. 

CONS:
The car has the major blind spot due to the positioning of the rear and side windows.  Also the rear window restricts your backing up vision so this takes some getting used to.  
Because this car is designed to be sporty, the backseat has very little headroom and feet can be cramped also depending on how the front passengers adjust their seats.  If you have passengers that tend to be carsick, this is not a good car for them because the high placement of the windows will make them woozy (especially in the back).  Also the front passenger seat doesn't slide back far enough to relax long legs on a long trip. 
The seats are also rather uncomfortable on long journeys, so take something soft to sit on.
Because of the shape of the car, the doors are quite long and you have to reach really far back for the seatbelts.
Parts can be expensive for this car (including H-rated tires which it requires).  But if my car is any indicator, you won't need many parts as long as you keep up the routine maintenance.

CAUTIONS:
1.  Be careful to wipe extra oil off the engine block if you spill any when pouring it in.  My research on these cars turned up a few instances of engine fires caused by this.
2.  Be careful to do a thorough blind spot check every time you change lanes.  Try positioning the car next to a parked car when you first buy it and finding where this blind spot is, and get used to craning your neck a little on the highway.
3.  Check and change the oil regularly.  These cars run at very high RPM and my mechanic told me it's not uncommon for them to burn or leak oil at high mileage, but as long as you keep it changed and keep it full it will give you long years of service.  I've almost run mine dry by accident a few times when I forgot to check - I usually have to put in about 1 qt every month for the amount I drive.
4.  Check your coolant hoses and make sure they're in good shape.  I've had 2 rotted hoses that burst at high mileage.
