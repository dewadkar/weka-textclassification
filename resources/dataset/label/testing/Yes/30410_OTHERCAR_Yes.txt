            We had the half ton 1996 Suburban and loved it!  Great ride, comfortable interior and loads of room for the whole family including the dog.  But the real selling point in the Chevy Suburban for us came after we encountered ice on the Interstate in Wyoming and lost control of our Suburban and wound up in a ditch on our roof.  The whole experience was terrifying to say the least, but the positive point is that our entire family, including our 18 month old daughter who was in her car seat, and our Golden Retriever who was in the 3rd seat, walked away from this crash with only minor bumps and scratches.  In fact, this Suburban held up so well that we were surprised the insurance company totaled it.  We now are the proud owners of a 1999 Suburban and feel like we are in the safest vehicle we could own!<br><br>
