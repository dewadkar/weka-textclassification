               In 1996 I bought a Volkswagen Golf GL 4Dr.  My wife and I were expecting a baby in the summer.  We needed good transportation so I bought German.  We were attracted to the good gas mileage, the small size, the 17 cubic feet for carrying baby supplies, and a hatchback for easy access.  The price at just over 14K was reasonable for a &quot;German&quot; car.  
    Within the first three months, I had the car services for the same fluid leak and had brand new transmission put in.  That's right a New Transmission!  The plastic molding cracked repeatedly in the cold Wisconsin winter and would drag on the highway.  In early 1998, the starter went and in late 1998 the rear brakes were leaking fluid corroding the discs.  
    Despite the bugs in the early going, this car has served us well.  It has carted a family of four, a double stroller, and supplies across the country and back several times.  50K+ miles in three years and it still rides quiet.  The interior has taken a beating from the kids but has held up great.  It can be slow going up hill in the Rockies but I don't spend the big bucks at the pump.  That makes a big difference living in California.  
    If you're a family starting out or a single person on a budget but need space to travel, buy a Golf.  I've taken it camping and I have taken to the mall.  It handles everything that doesn't need 4WD.  It certainly isn't an SUV but it doesn't guzzle gas. Next time I would buy a TDI, its better on the gas mileage and I would probably get a Moon roof. <br><br>
