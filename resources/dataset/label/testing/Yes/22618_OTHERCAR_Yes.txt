            I have owned pre-owned Volkswagen Cabriolet's for the past 6 years.  My first was purchased in 1994.  It was a beautiful 1985 dark blue with a dark blue roof - cream puff!  Manual everything!  How I loved that car!  It was the first car I ever completely purchased with my own money.  I paid $5,200 at the time from a man who's company moved him from California to NJ.  It was his wife's car and the children did not like it.  I was the second owner.  Now, I have a 1992 red with a black roof.  It has many upgrades such as power windows (wow!) and a lot lower miles (42,000! - my 1985 was purchased with 86,000 miles on it).  I sold my little blue car online within a week to a couple in New Haven,CT.  It was like parting with child.  Broke my heart, but, my initial reasoning for updating to a newer car was for the lower miles and a piece of mind knowing that for the next five to ten years the car would go virtually maintenance free.

Volkswagens have a reputation for never dying.  That statement is solid gold true.  Even with over 140,000 miles on it, my little blue cabriolet was still going strong.  In the time I had it, I replaced the tires, alternator, spark plugs, struts, and oil changed every 3,000 miles.  All only expected with routine maintenance.  When I purchased my red cabriolet (off a dealership floor for $7,800) I needed to replace the tires, spark plugs and muffler.  Volkswagens are known for burning hot, so replacing the muffler was of no surprise and it should be expected with these cars.  Having gone from a complete manual car to a lap of luxury partial-manual cabriolet, the only differences in the handling of the car is cushioning.  I find that the 1992 handles the road much better and takes  bumps in the road a little lighter.  The seats are much more comfortable and the controls are extremely convenient to the driver.  The breaks stop on a dime and the stick shift takes a lighter touch. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my upgrade, although I can't help but think of my dark blue baby every once in a maternal while.

If I had to recommend this car to anyone, I would target the individual who seeks a car that they can control.  This car needs a driver who is not turned off by having to manually take the car top down.  The reliance of the vehicle is perfect for a first time car buyer who is on a budget.  They are highly collectable cars and hold their buying value if properly cared for.  I use mine summer and winter.  It is a wonderful year round car and should not be thought of as just a summer play thing. I must admit that I am partial to the body type of the 1983-1993 cabriolet.  The rounder type that was made in 1993-date I cannot comment on. I found that they fell somewhat out of my price range at this time.  When I am ready to sell my 1992, I will consider the newer type, however the new Jetta is pretty nice.  Oh well, that's far, far into the future.<br><br>
