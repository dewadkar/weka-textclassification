            The 1998 passport made substantial changes in the engine and transmission, adding some horsepower to make it quite quick for a 6 cyclinder.
1999 added certain cosmetic refinements to bring it up in class with its competitors, with new bumper and dash redesign.

2000continued with minor cosmetic changes with more options, more room for sound quality, and options for exterior looks. These changes differ it from the rodeo by vision but mostly the same guts in each.

my 1999 has handled the heat of the summer well, giving me a generous 19mpg in 100degree heat with full a/c. More comfortable seats is the only (-). ****<br><br>
