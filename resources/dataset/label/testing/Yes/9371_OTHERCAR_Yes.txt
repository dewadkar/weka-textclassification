            Mechanical performance, safety, a sleek exterior, comfort and convenience; all features found in the 2002 Toyota 4 Runner.
Before settle ling on the 4Runner, I researched, viewed, and test-drove a good number of other SUVs, everything from Chevy Trailblazers to Rav4s, but it was the 4Runner&#146s overall appearance, performance, and reputation that led me to purchase the vehicle.

My Burgundy 2002 4Runner has great city appeal.  It&#146s not boxy and oversized, nor is it so small that you forget you&#146re driving an SUV. 
Exterior:  When choosing an SUV, don&#146t settle for small tires. I recommend the p265/70r16 tires W/16&#148 Allow wheels. Along with emphasized side moldings, larger wheels allow for a sturdier appeal, and better track riding.  Chrome front and rear bumpers,/grille, halogen headlamps, skid plates, and a running board are all features that are offered, which I feel make a significant difference in the exterior appeal (all for about 2k more than vehicles without).
The ride:  I have found myself telling my passengers: &#147sorry, but I didn&#146t promise the smoothest ride ever&#148.  Although the ride isn&#146t as smooth as I would have ideally liked, it does not necessarily disappoint.  The 3.4 V6 engine gives great power.  It provides better than average acceleration and speed.  
Compared to its comparable competition, the 4Runner offers competitive luxury features, competitive exterior appeal, a significantly better ride, and maybe most importantly, a brand image that is built on quality and performance.
