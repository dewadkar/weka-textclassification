This is my first experience with a digital camera, and I'm pleasantly satisfied with my purchase.  

pros:

- Cool, shiny blue exterior, LCD screen, nice camera size, though a bit bulky.

- Pictures are of good quality, comes with PhotoGenie software to improve resolution (though I'd recommend filling in the missing pixels with Photoshop or PSP since the Genie is quite limited)

- Also comes with a case, carry strap, cables to attach to your computer, and even your tv set.  

- It's not complicated.  You can easily learn how to use the menu and flash settings in half an hour.

- Fast download time.  Getting an image into your computer takes about thirty seconds.  I've heard the fancier cameras can do it in five, and unless you're incredibly impatient, the 780c does the job well.

minor cons:

- The three focus settings take some getting used to, and since there's no zoom function, you almost always need to used the LCD to know what you're capturing on disk.

- The LCD eats up the batteries like candy.  Invest in rechargeables, 4AA batteries take about fourteen hours.  You have to remember to do this overnight.

- If you choose the best picture setting (four stars), this leaves you with only twelve shots before the disk is full.  Thus you need to download all of them to your computer straight away (impossible if you're on vacation), buy more disks, or opt to take lower-resolution photos.

- Availability.  My fiance and I got tons of weekend sales brochures from the biggies (Best Buy, Circuit City, Sears) and went to each looking for this model, yet every store was sold out.  We finally found one (the last in stock) at (surprise, surprise!) a Ritz camera shop.  Who knew they still sold cameras at camera shops?  Anyway, avoid the hassle and buy it online.

In summary it's an attractive, affordable, basic camera for beginners.  The images it produces are good for personal websites, online photo albums, and sharing with friends through email.  You definitely get your money's worth.
