            I've heard many people's opinions on Saturns.  Some bad, but mostly good.  I myself have had 2 Saturns.  The first being a coupe, and the second the sedan which I still currently own, well, until my 21st birthday when I'm hoping I will be able to get a different car.  One thing I can say, is I trust Saturn cars completely.

First, I'll start with the good parts about the SL2.  I've had the car for about a year.  I've driven my parent's SL1 and it's pickup isn't what I want so when I test drove this car I was thinking the pickup wouldn't be what I wanted.  However, I soon found out it did a lot better than I expected.  It actually drove almost like the coupe I owned.  Granted, it won't be as good as other cars would be I imagine.  But, for a Saturn, it is better than people expect.  Just got to give it a little gas.  Another thing I'm happy with is it's handling.  My friend always holds onto the handles as I tend to take corners quickly.  On most off-ramps, I can manage to go 40 without the tires squealing or without feeling the car is going to slide off the road.  It has it's share of problems, but it hasn't actually broken down to the point of needing extremely costly repairs so far.  There are other good aspects to this car, but none are coming to my head at the moment.  Onto the bad.

The major thing I don't like is the brake pedal.  While the car stops, I feel the pedal goes down too far.  I've had it in the shop several times and they had replaced something in there and said there was nothing else to be done.  They said that it going down so far will increase the pressure on the brakes so to stop the car better.  The only other major part I dislike the car is how the transmission shifts.  If you push the gas too hard, too fast the transmission will make the car jump when it shifts into second gear.

There really are no more major cons about the car, well, other than the normal maintenance on the car that are a pain in the rear.  I have had it in the shop more than my coupe, and my coupe was in overall bad shape.  However, I feel it's due more to the previous owner(s) not taking care of it as they should.

I would recommend the same year and model to other people.  Just make sure you get it looked at before you buy it.
