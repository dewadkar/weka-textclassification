            We have had our Contour a year and a half now.  We wanted a small family car, front wheel drive, and a standard transmission.  When we saw this Contour on the lot-the last standard in it's class-we loved the look.  When we saw what it offered inside we liked it even more.  We took it for a test drive and before we arrived back at the dealership, we knew we were going to take it.  The price was already right so we didn't have to do much bargaining for it.  We had previously owned a Ford Tempo.  The Contour has been the best car we've ever had.  We're looking to trade again this fall and I'm sure we'll look at the Contour's first.  The smooth driving, low maintenance, and affordability are what make this car the right one!  I think small families (one or two children) are the best people for this car.  The backseat could fit three children, but it would be tight on a long vacation.  It's also sporty enough for a single person who is looking for the sporty look.  <br><br>
