            The reason i bought this vehicle is that I needed a good truck for a small amount of money.  This truck was in good shape and ran very well.  The things i love about this vehicle is that it is so light weight that it handles very well off-road.  It also has not had any major engine probles and it has 120,000 miles on the truck.  The things i do not like about the truck is that the interior is very small and you can not get much in the back seat.  You can carry two people in the front but only one in the back with comfort.  The vehicle does not have alot of power in the motor, and does not pull trailers very well.  The truck drives well but it does not have the speed for the everyday fast driving person.  Anyone should buy this vehicle who is looking for a dependable long lasting truck.<br><br>
