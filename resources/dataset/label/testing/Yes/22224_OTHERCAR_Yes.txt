            I have now owned my M Coupe for one week now. This is obviously not a long-term ownership review of the car. So far I like it better than when I was thinking about purchasing the car.

Positives:
The car rides tightly but not rough. My other car is a Saab that rides much more harshly over the bay area's cracks and potholes. The M Coupe does a much better job at dampening the shock of hitting these road imperfections.

The engine has a tremendous amount of low-end power. You learn quickly not to stand on the gas pedal during day-to-day driving but at the same time merging into traffic has never been easier. Highway passes are easily accomplished without downshifting unless you are trying to get someone's attention. 

The transmission is how every manual transmission car should shift. The gear gates are perfectly spaced and the gearing itself never feels like the car is over- or under-revving. If more cars had transmissions like this there would probably be less automatic transmissions on the road.
I could sit in this car for weeks. The seats offer perfect support if you are the right size (5'3&quot; to 6'1&quot;). If you have developed a bit of spread these seats will feel too tight.
 
Negatives:
If I were building this car I would put a tilt/slide-back sunroof in the car. The engineers were limited in overall car height and could not afford to take away any more headroom. If you are over 6'1&quot; you will find this car too short as it is.

The windshield is fairly short and right-hand turns are partially blocked by the rear-view mirror. If you like to pull onto the crosswalk at red lights you will probably not be able to see the traffic signal anymore. And if you are not careful you will run into pedestrians at right-turns. This is not really a city car.

Some people do not like the way this car looks. I do. And I do not buy cars for those other people. If they don't like it they should stick to their minivan, SUV, 5-passenger &quot;sport&quot; cars and be happy with their lot.

In conclusion:  
This car costs a lot of money for a small, aggressive two-seater. If you put a lot of traffic miles on a car, or abuse it in day-to-day driving, I would look for something less high-strung. If you actually enjoy driving on empty, twisting two-lane roads and take care of it, this car will keep you happy for the next 30 years at a fraction of the price of similar sports cars. <br><br>
