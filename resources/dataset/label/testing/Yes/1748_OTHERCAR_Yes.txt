            After I sent her 1995 Mazda Protege on to its great reward, a good friend of mine replaced it with a used 1995 Mazda 626 LX.  Now, one would expect that moving UP in the product line would mean getting a better car, but I don't think that is the case with the Mazda.  Don't get me wrong!  The 626 has some nice qualities, with a powerful engine, smooth transmission, and attractive styling.  But the mid-nineties models offer no more interior room than their lower-priced sibling, the Protege.  

Like her previous Mazda, the 626 seems to eat brakes.  And I would offer this advice to owners of any Mazda product--change the plugs and wires promptly at 30,000 mile intervals.  While other cars are more forgiving about this oft-overlooked maintenance step, Mazdas will let you know in no uncertain terms that the maintenance schedules are to be followed to the letter!  

The 626 LX model I am experienced with came equipped with all power options, a power moonroof, aluminum wheels, and automatic transmission.  One interesting feature is the oscilatting center vents--which circulate air around the cabin.  The seats are comfortable, but I would recommend seating no more than two in the rear, as the center &quot;hump&quot; is quite pronounced.  

The car offers admirable passing power, and the ability to hold its speed on highway grades without downshifting.  Acceleration is smooth and in line with expectations for cars of this class. The ride is fairly quiet, and the controls are layed out in a simple and logical fashion.  Interior finishes are high quality.  

The major downfall to the car...and this seems to be a common problem with the 1995 626s is the poor transmission quality. At 60,000 the 626 transmission went out...preluded by much lurching and Geo Metro-like acceleration.  I wish I could recommend this car more highly, but I have heard literally dozens of reports of transmission problems with the '95 model.  Earlier and later models have fared better--a family member got more than 120,000 miles out of a '92 with a manual transmission.  

Transmission problems aside, the car provides a change from the cookie cutter styling of the Accord and Camry.  <br><br>
