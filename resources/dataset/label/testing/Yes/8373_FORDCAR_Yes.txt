            I must admit, before I really begin, that my poor Explorer has not been treated nicely. My parents bestowed it upon me when I got my license two years ago, and right from the get-go it's been beat-on mercilessly. Peelin' out, hard cornering, even brutal off-roading. I put this beast through it all. And, on one hand, I have to give it some credit. It still runs well, and I drive it a lot- I'm a pizza delivery guy, so every weekend I'm pummeling the poor SUV. But, it also has cost me a lot of money, so I can't give it too much credit.

I can't attribute all of the damage to my driving, either. I have quite a few friends who drive Explorers similar to mine, and they cite similar problems- weak acceleration as the mileage pours on, 4 x 4 failure, horrible brakes. Apparently, or maybe just in Albany, NY, these are chronic Explorin' problems.

As far as the aforementioned acceleration and mileage are concerned, they're going straight to hell. This bear sports a 4.0 V6 and around 190 horsepower (I'm told) from the factory. Right now, I'd guess she's putting out about 6 HP. Now, the Explorer <i>used</i> to have a lot of balls. Time and abuse have taken their toll, though, and have proven the Explorer quite susceptible to that toll. It moves, sure, but sometimes I need to turn off the A/C for quick take-offs and merging. Not a good sign. Mileage is ridiculous now, and I find myself filling up twice a week on just normal usage. Were I bringing the car to college, I'd probably get rid of it. Gas is simply getting too expensive at this point.

Also, don't let the name fool you- these babies aren't meant for any hardcore Explorin'. I caused $1200 worth of brake damage by 4-wheeling around on a beach. I still don't think of that as too rough, but all 4 brakes got so clogged with sand that they were rendered useless. We didn't even bother to fix the ABS system, which was another $500. For lower-key Explorin', though, I think it should be fine. Thanks to the hardcore 4 x 4(when it works), I've never been stuck, even in some muddy and/or snowy situations.

The body is durable, but is beginning to rust in many locations. Watch under your doors- the doglegs, I've been told they're called- as they rust very quickly. Investing in some running boards to protect that area might be wise. 

The cargo space is fantastic for anyone. I've hauled everything from dirt for my dad to our snowblower to even freshman girls (you can really pack those back there). Especially with the back seats folded down, you can fit anything you would need to back there.

In closing, I'm an abusive 18 year old, and I abused this poor car. I'd have to say that if you want to give your Explorer to your kid, it's probably not the best idea. It's just an expensive one. But I still put a lot of faith in my ride; it hasn't broken down on me yet, or even shown signs of it, even with 101,000 miles. If you can handle frequent brake repairs and increasingly sluggish acceleration in exchange for an unstoppable, affordable, reliable SUV, I'd have to say that an old Explorer probably isn't a bad idea.
