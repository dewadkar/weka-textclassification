            The saying goes �there�s only one Jeep�. Talk to any Jeep owner and they will usually rave about their Jeep Grand Cherokee. When I started researching SUV in 1998, I decided that most were extremely overpriced. So I decided to buy a used 1997 model. It still had all the features I was looking for but with only 12,000 miles and 2 full years left on the warrantee, the 18,500 price was too good to pass up.


<b>What you get:</b>

My Jeep came with a 5.2L 185HP engine. Standard equipment includes dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, illuminated entry system and power windows and door locks. Other standard items include CFC-free air conditioning, removable folding rear seat and keyless remote entry system. I have the Larado model, but the Limited adds automatic climate control, fog lights, power leather seats and HomeLink remote transmitter.

The main reason for picking the Jeep was the suspension. The SUV handles just like a car. (Why do you think every mother in America is driving one these days). The Explorer and Blazer were built on a Truck frame, while the Jeep was on a car base.

<b>Drawbacks:</b>

The one issue is that the Jeep does not have as much cargo space compare to the other models, mainly because the tire is mounted in the storage area. (They have solved this problem starting with the newly redesigned 1999 model. They put the tire underneath) Also trying to fit 4 people in the back seat is a very tight.

Gas mileage will vary, but you should get between 16 �20 miles per gallon with standard driving conditions. The gas take will hold 20 gallons, so fill up are still at regular 1 to 2 week intervals. Of course with the price of gas so high last year, I was tempted to get ride of the Jeep for a more fuel efficent car.  I was get sick of putting in 35 - 40 dollars worth of gas at every fill up. But, gas has come down and I also settled down.

There have only been a few recalls on this model and I recently had my Jeep fitted for new brake rotors. If you own a 1995 - 1997 model, please check to see if yours are covered.


<b>Conclusion:</b> Still enjoying the ride after 60,000 miles.  I will purchase a Jeep again, once I put on 120,000 miles or more on my current Jeep Grand Cherokee.
