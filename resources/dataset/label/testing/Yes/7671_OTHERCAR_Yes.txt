            When my husband and I got in an accident we were in the market for a new vehicle.  We had never owned a truck before, but it was something we wanted.  We also did not want to spend alot of money.  Looking at ads, we saw the Toyota Tacoma.  We decided to go look at it.  We immediately liked it.  It has a clean, sharp look from the outside.  After taking it for a short test drive, we decided to buy it.  

Now, it is not the fanciest truck in the world.  It has just the basic AM/FM radio in it, but it does sound good.  It also has Air Conditioning, which is something we were looking for as a must.  (I think it comes regularly.) 

The seat is your basic run of the mill truck cloth seats.  It does have a slight lumbar support built into it, that makes it a little more comfortable.  We have taken many trips and I have been very comfortable throughout the entire trip.  You can't lay back, but that is expected in a truck.  

The dashboard is a low shine plastic.  The light does not reflect in off of it.  It also is very easy to clean with a wet cloth.  The window is tinted on the top to help block light also.  The sun visor is very small and also made of plastic. It does disconnect on the one side to rotate it to block out light coming in the side windows.  Our truck does not have the sliding back window, which I would suggest.  It would help pull the wind out and circulate when you have the windows open.  

Another feature I really would have liked to have seen is the windshield delay feature.  It does not have it, so when it is not raining hard enough to have the wipers on constantly, you have to manually do it when you think it needs done.  This is a real pain, and about my only complaint with the truck.  

Speaking of rain, that is also worth mentioning.  Like other little trucks, because of the low weight in the back, it does slide in the rain and snow.  During the winter, we do put sand bags in the back.  You just have to take it a little bit slower.  It will get you through!!!  We have never been stuck in the snow yet!!!

We bought the Manual 5 speed transmission, and love the pick-up it has.  You can easily pull out on the highway and quickly get up to speed.  It also gets great gas mileage, which was a positive during these high gas price times.  We live about 40 minutes away from work, so it is quite a distance.  We have to generally fill up about every 5 days.  With that much driving, I think that is great!!  Much better than my Jeep.  (Also evaluated if you want to check it out)

We have used the bed for many things, and have been very happy with it.  It has moved us 2 times, moved many friends, brought a new refrigerator home, plus too many other haulings to list.  You can just pack it full, and it will take it.  It's remarkable what this little truck can take.

Now, for the reliability, it is the best vehicle we have ever owned.  We bought the service contract on it, because of bad luck with past cars.  We have never, ever had to use it!!!!!  In fact, the only thing we have had to do is change the oil every 3,000 miles, rotate the tires (replaced once too), and had the front brakes replaced.  Now, for a 4 year old truck, I don't think that is bad at all.  I guess what they say about Toyota's is true.  This is the most dependable vehicle we have ever owned.  

I would recommend this truck if you are looking for a small, low maintenance, not full of extras, truck.
