            I bought one for my first car. It is a '91, 2.5l, red w/white top. It has 92,000 miles on it right now and it is running pretty good. I love the fact that it is convertible but I do not like it in the winter time or when it rains. Mine leaks a little and it does not keep the warmth in. I have heard a lot about them leaking but it may be from wear. The top has no holes in it but wear the stitching is for the trim it is coming apart. The back window is not the easiest to see out of anymore (plastic). As for the running of it, it is very good for the mileage. I feel that I have taken care of it fairly well changing the oil every 3,000 and giving it a tune-up about every 10,000. I have had it for almost two years now and put 30,000 miles on it and the only thing that I needed was a muffler which was fairly inexpensive. I think that it a great first car, fairly cheap. Or for a couple that enjoys summer drives. I don't exactly recommend it for children due to it being a convertible. Nor would I take 5 people in it. It is a 4 seater and if you have ever been in one you know what I mean. Most convertibles are fancy and expensive but this one one is not expensive but it is enjoyable.<br><br>
