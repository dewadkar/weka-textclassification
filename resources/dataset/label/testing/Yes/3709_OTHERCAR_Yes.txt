            I am the proud and recent owner of a 1995 Silverado 1500 Extended cab long bed 4 x 4 Chevrolet pick up truck.  AND I LOVE IT.  
I am a 5'3&quot; woman who has lusted after a pickup truck for sometime to replace my 1987 K-5 Blazer (200K + miles).  Well I finally got my dream truck just before the holidays this fall.  It came with a hard tonneau cover and bedliner.  
Here in the Rockies we have had some reasonable snowfall and Buck the Truck has had no problem.  He pulls the mountains well.  He is a full size truck so he does not have the sports car feel but he rides like a big luxury car. He handles well and is easy to park. The shift on the fly 4 wheel drive controls are easy to reach and operate. All the dash displays are easy to read either day or night.
Gas mileage has been better than expected. The stereo and other dash controls are easy to find and operate. As I said I am not very tall, but the dimensions of the cab fit me as well as my tall husband.  The captain type seats are comfortable and have a wide range of adjustments. The mirror and windows provide great visibility.  
Since I am involved in a youth horse group, Buck the Truck has been a wonderful tool for hauling kids, saddles, costumes, tack and hay.  <br><br>
