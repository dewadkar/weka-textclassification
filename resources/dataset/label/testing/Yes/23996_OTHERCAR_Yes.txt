            Our last 4 cars have been Hondas and they have all been great!  Now if I could quick wrecking them we could stick with the two that we currently have!  On that note, I have never been in a very serious accident, but the cars seem very safe.  Never any injuries.  We currently have a 1992 Honda Accord (our second Accord).  It has about 100,000 miles and is still going strong.  The only thing we have ever had to do is fix the brakes, replace the battery and replace tires.  I don't really consider those things repairs.  More like expected maintenance.  This has been such a great car and it looks good too.  It is a few years old but doesn't really look it.

You really can't go wrong with a Honda.  We also have a Honda Civic Hatchback and we love that too.  It is a little small but we had a 4 door Civic (another great car) in the past and it was very close in size to the Accord.

Can't say enough good things about these cars!<br><br>
