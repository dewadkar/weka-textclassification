            I had the opportunity to drive a brand new 2002 Infiniti I35 when I had my QX4 serviced.  This total ownership experience may be one significant reason to buy an Infiniti, beyond the focus on customer service, but the free loaner Infiniti cars whenever you car is serviced.  Depending on the dealership, you are at least entitled to a loaner vehicle for the duration of your bumper to bumper warranty, and certain dealerships will extend that benefit to 100,000 miles.  One example of their customer service was when I had a problem with one of tires.  The tires are not covered by the manufacturer of the vehicle, but are covered separately by the manufacturer of the tire.  The dealership offered to handle the process of submitting the claim to the tire manufacturer and obtaining a credit towards a new tire.  

Now, to the car...  The I35 underwent a mild revision during 2002 from 2001.  Most significant was the upgrade of the engine to 255 hp.  The new engine is heavier so although there is a lot of power, the 0-60 decreases by a little bit over 1 second.  Also, the I35 now has traction control AND the viscous limited slip differential on the front tires standard.  Both these items use to be separate options on the 2001 and in fact, the viscous limited slip differential was only available on the touring model.  So, Infiniti really delivers a lot in the 2002 I35, first upgrading the engine and then making items that used to cost extra, standard WITHOUT a substantial price increase at all.  

Now, are these two items worth anything?  Yes.  The traction control helps during heavy rains, snow, and either cuts power or shifts earlier to help maintain traction.  The viscous limited differential helps cornering, by shifting the power to the front tire that has the traction.  This item came in particularly useful when I floored the I35 out of a corner and the engine really delivered while maintaining traction with minimal torque steer.  The viscous limited differential also helps minimize the torque steer which is prevalant in most front wheel drive vehicles.  To experience torque steer, simply floor any front wheel drive vehicle and notice the steering wheel pull to the right or left.  For most cars, the net result is a fight between the driver and the front wheel.  Anyways, the I35 has torque steer, but not as bad as other vehicles, especially recognizing that 255 hp are pulling this vehicle.

In terms of performance, this car sticks to the pavement very well.  Minimal body roll on turns and smooth ride overall.  The suspension is well tuned, but the rear suspension is semi-independent which on really rough freeways or cornering, is sometimes overwhelmed.  Otherwise, over small bumps, potholes, etc. the suspension absorbs them well.  

The engine is responsive, sounds wonderful, and is work of art.  The engine has a reputation for quality, reliability, and most importantly, is recognized by the leading automotive authority as one of the 10 best engines for the past 8 years (see www.wardsauto.com).  The Infiniti models are known for reliability and safety.

The I35 is equipped with a slew of safety equipment.  Front airbags for both driver and front passenger.  Side chest/head airbags which are built into the front seats.  These are not simply side airbags, but also include protection for the head.  Also, the I35 includes anti-lock brakes and all kinds of other crash protection.  All in all, the net result is crash results that are competitive with all the other competitors such as the ES300, Acura TL, etc.

Also, one competitor is the Nissan Maxima which is a brother/sister to the I35.  One thing the Maxima does not have is the viscous limited slip differential.  Additionally, once you include all the options (including extending the Nissan warranty) so the Maxima is comparable to the I35, the price increases to what you would pay for an I35.

The bottom line is that for the price which is heavily discounted as the I35 competitors have all recently revised their offerings (see new ES300, Acura TL Type S, etc.) and the I35 will change during the 2003 model year, you will get a reliable, safe, FAST sports sedans with all the options and quality that other competitors have.  Plus, the I35 is not as common as an Accord and is a lot more interesting to drive.  Did I say the Xenon lights are really wonderful for driving at night?  Plus, the I35 has fog lights (assuming the Xenons are not enough) and when turning, there are side turning lights too!  Good luck on your decision.
