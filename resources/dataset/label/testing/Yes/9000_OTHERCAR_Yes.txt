            <b>Why Kia?</b>
The first time a saw a Kia Sportage I was driving with a friend.  I said <i>that's the cutest car I've ever seen in my life,  I must have one</i>.  I was pretty tired of my clunky old Blazer at the time, but not really ready to pick up car payments again, so I didn't think too much more about it.

About two months later I went into a Kia dealer <b>just to look</b>.  The greatest salesperson in the world (Roger at Arlington Kia in Illinois) spent quite a lot of time with me showing me all the different models, features and option packages.  Once we went for a test drive I was hooked.  And when I saw the price, the rebate and the warranty I bought the car and never looked back!

<b>What's So Great About the Kia Sportage</b>
The Kia is a very comfortable ride.  Recently I went on a fairly long trip including two small children and there were no complaints from any of us.  The seats are comfortable, the heating and cooling systems work great, there is plenty of head and leg room, the CD player (included in the EX package) sounds great, and there are plenty of cup holders, ashtrays and storage spots to make for a pleasant journey.

As for mileage, on the highway, I average about 27 MPG, pretty good for any SUV.  It doesn't do as well in the city, only about 19 MPG, but still not too bad.

How about space?  I love shopping in my Kia Sportage because there is loads of room in the rear for purchases.  And if I need more cargo space, I can fold down the rear seats and fit pretty much anything I need.  It also came with a rack on top, but that only holds 100 lbs, so that's not overly useful.

As far as handling, the Kia is really fun to drive.  The visibility and turn radius are excellent.  Changing lanes and parking this car are a breeze.  And for those of us in snowy climates you can put your Kia into 4 wheel drive on the fly and zoom down those snow covered streets.

And how cute is the Kia Sportage?!  I swear I constantly have complete strangers coming up to me and saying <i>oh my God your car is so cute...adorable...attractive</i>...pick your adjective.  And this includes men as well as women although they are more likely to say <i>this is a good looking car</i> than to actually use the word cute.

<b>It Can't Be All Good Can It?</b>
Of course there are a couple of thing that are not perfect with the Kia Sportage, the main one being pickup.  This car does not have speedy pickup, particularly if you are running the air conditioning.  There is also quite a bit of traffic noise if you are not playing the radio.  And I <b>HATE</b> the fact that I have to use the key to open the rear cargo door, there is no release on the inside.

All in all, I am very satisfied with the Kia Sportage.  It is economical, it drives well, it is reliable and it is comfortable.  Do not buy this car if you are looking to race past everyone at stop lights or if you are looking for a luxury vehicle.  Buy this car if you are looking for a great car with great option packages for a great price.
