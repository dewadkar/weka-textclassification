            With the boom of digital cameras, I wanted to wait until prices came down a little before purchasing one that would be obsolete in a few short months.  I finally broke down and got the HP PhotoSmart 315 for one of many reasons.  Mainly, the stores I went to didn't have any comparable ones in stock.
Easy to set up with USB port connection instead of the old video card setup from years ago, and with most computers these days, you have USB ports right in front of your system.
Very easy to use menu to set date and time, and easy to use zoom features. Another nice feature is when you take a pic, you have a review of your shot, and if you don't like it, you delete it and start over. You have your choice of 80 shots at time for partially good shots, 20 for fine shots, or 10 pics for super quality shots.
The only set back I find with this camera is the garbage software that came with it.  It doesn't have a great photo editing software, so I use my MS Photo Editor to do some great editing. In the box you get Energizer batteries, strap, usb cable and camera.  The ac adapter from them is 49.95, I got mine from eBay for 19.95.  I recommend using the ac adapter for uploading your images so as not to drain your batteries.
This camera is great for quick shots and away from home shots, but the quality is still compromised compared to real photos.
