            I saved my Cherokee from the wholesale auction block and got a good deal at the same time. I bought my Cherokee Limited from a local dealer who had received it as a trade. They had it stuck out behind their dealership, hidden from the public.

The clear coat on the hood and roof had oxidized, but the paint and primer were still intact, plus there was NO rust! I bought my Jeep for $3500, then spent $500 to have the hood and roof repainted. You would never know that it ever had a problem. I found out later, from reading extensively in Jeep user groups, that the 1988 - 1992 model years were notorious for defective clear coat.

The Cherokee had 104,000 miles on it when I bought it, but I am now convinced, 27,000 miles later, that I will get in excess of 200,000 miles before I'm done.

Due to the fact that the Jeep was almost 9 years old when I bought it, I expected that I would need to do some work, but the reality has been much better than I expected. 

The majority of the work that I have run into has been replacing seals, valve cover, etc., which had deteriorated over the course of the vehicle long life. After replacing the seals and having the from brakes and rotors replaced, it has run like a top ever since. I commute 50+ miles, one way, each day and this Cherokee has been my dependable daily driver.

Being a limited, it is completely decked out. Power everything. The only thing that they missed, which is kind of suprising, is a cup holder! There are after market cup holders, though, that fit perfectly over the emergency brake and center console (Without obstructing the use of the EB).

Overall this is a really fun Jeep. I am planning to keep this as my home/fun Jeep, though, since it only gets ~18 MPG.
