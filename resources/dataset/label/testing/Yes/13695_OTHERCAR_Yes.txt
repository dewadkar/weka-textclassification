            A writer for a popular auto magazine once wrote that the 626 is most underrated mid-sized sedan, why? Well I must agree, until I bought mine I never really gave the 626's a second glance, and I'm one of those "car nuts". The car is just as good as it's Camry, Maxima, and Accord brothers. It's put together very well, the seats are comfortable and supportive. The leather seats like I have are some of the best I've seen, but just to let you know the only part that is leather is the part you actually sit on. The plastics have a nice grain look (and doesn't look cheap) just like Toyota. The dash is laid out well, but it's missing some gauges like the oil pressure, volt meter. These gauges are important and I've never understood why most of the Japanese car manufactures don't use them. One thing I like that's also unusual is the two center a/c vents that swing back-and-forth, but can turned off if it's distracting. The 626's have used these vents for some time. The interior of the car is also well thought out. The HVAC controls are well placed as are the radio controls. The power window switches are very similier to Toyota. One feature that it's missing that I find very useful is the lack of a passenger side power doorlock switch. Other than that I find nothing else wrong with the interior. It has the typical interior features that you would expect in a car of it's class, power windows, locks, mirrors, antenna, and trunk. Now to the exterior. The design is very elegant and all the body lines seam to flow together, unlike others in it's class. There are two trim levels to choose from, LX and ES. The 2.0 4cyl is standard in both, as is the 2.5 V6, and both engines are available with a 5 speed transmission. The 4 cyl like I have offers very good performance. I can't comment on the 2.5 V6, but I have driven a 96' MX6 which is basically the same car with the 2.5 and it moves. The 4 speed automatic shifts smoothly. It's one of the few auto's that's matched to the engine. Now let's talk about one feature that most people take for granted, the brakes. My ES has disc in the front and drums in the back, I think the V6 626 has 4 wheel disc, but I'm not sure. The brake system on my 626 is very well engineered. When you need to put your foot on the binders it will stop it in a short distance. Also all 626's are equipped with 4 wheel ABS, so yiur braking needs are taken care of. If you opt for the ES you get a power moonroof, it's not available with the LX. I've owned this car for 6 months and I've got only one problem that still has not been resolved yet. The problem when the car is in park, and running with the a/c on it vibrates just a little. The car is still under warranty, so I'm not worried. The dealership experience is also something to consider when buying a car. (something GM needs to work on) My dealership experience has been great, and I mean great. (If anybody lives in the Tampa Bay area try Lindell Mazda) This has been the second best car I've ever owned, Mazda just might have a long term customer, we shall see.
