            Back in August, I purchased a brand new 2001 Daewoo Lanos. It is a 2 door hatchback. It's been a few months now, and I don't have any major complaints.

I'm not saying the car is perfect, but I think it is a good car for the price. Altogether, it came to about $10,000. It gets decent gas mileage. It is a small car, but you don't get that "crammed in" feeling. I can fit more in the trunk of the Lanos than my aunt could get in the back of her minivan!! The seats in the back fold down for a bit of extra trunk space.The Lanos gives a smooth ride, handles well, and it has a slightly classy look to it.

But, sadly, no car owner can get by without a few complaints. Interior wise, it looks good. But, the first thing I noticed is that the placement of the cupholder needs rethinking. Just below the radio, is the button for the cupholder. You push it and it slides out. But, you can't fit anything wider than a soda can--Snapple bottles don't fit!! If you have anything taller than a soda can, it's in front of the radio, and it's annoying if you are trying to use the radio controls.

One other thing I want to mention is that the defroster/defogger is not very effective. That, unfortunately, you don't discover until you need to use it. It seems to work very well for the hatchback window, but the windshield and side windows never seem to get totally cleared.

Two minor things that I also noticed that would not have pained them to include would have been a clock or floor mats. But I can get by. (I just bought one of those clocks that you stick you your dashboard.)

In conclusion, those minor complaints aside, it's a nice car. If you are using it to get to work and back, it's a good commuter car. The body design of the Lanos has a rounded back-end, which makes it easier to get in and out of tight parking spaces, especially when you have to parallel park on a crowded street. Good on gas, runs well, and pretty much all round decent car for your dollar.
