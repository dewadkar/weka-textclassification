            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is great.  The ride is smooth and comfortable, the seats are great, even for long road trips.  I did have some transmission problems after 20,000 miles, but the warranty covered the repairs.  I have had no more problems since the transmission was fixed.  The only time I take it to the shop is to have regular oil change, etc.

It's a great vehicle and I would consider purchasing another.  So if you want a great sporty roomy comfortable ride, consider checking out the Jeep Grand Cherokee.<br><br>
