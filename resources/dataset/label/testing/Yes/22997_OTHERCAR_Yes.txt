            This was my first experience with a digital camera. I was thrilled with the easy software and the ease of use of the camera. The pictures are great for the 640x480 resolution. They are great on the PC or TV and print well when you learn the program a little. The price has came down
and now a large popular retailer has rolled back the price under 200$.
As with all digitals get some rechargeable batteries and some good photo paper. If you want your pictures to look like they came from a studio you will need to spend a lot more but for the price this is a great all around camera.<br><br>
