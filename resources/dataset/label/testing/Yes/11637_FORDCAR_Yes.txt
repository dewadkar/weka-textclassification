            This vehicle is definitely worth the price.  As far as personal reasons for driving this car, I am extremely active in sports and this will cart around any equipment desired and the friends for companionship.  The Ford Explorer handles like a dream.  The four wheel drive is very easy to deal with, as it's as simple as the flick of a knob.  The only negative thing I can see is that the radio of mine has recently gone out, and is assumed by the dealer to be electrical.  I have taken it in to be fixed, yet the problem seems far from satisfactory.  Another con is the two door model.  Pay the extra for the two extra doors, you'll be glad you did.  The best part...the excellent gas mileage.<br><br>
