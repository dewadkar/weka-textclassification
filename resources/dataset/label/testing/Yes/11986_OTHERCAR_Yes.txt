            I drove a Land Cruiser 4.2L 6 cylinder Diesel while I was working in Kalabo, Zambia, for a couple of years. So I used it in exactly the terrain it was designed for (I therefore have no mercy for people who complain their SUV is using too much fuel cruising the highway: grow up and get a compact). The only tarmac in the entire district being the airstrip this vehicle spent 99% of its time in either deep (really deep) sand or negotiating mud in the flood plain of the mighty Zambezi river. 
Although I feel that the Toyota Hi-lux is an overall better performer in these conditions (I may put in a review on that car as well) this car certainly performed well. I remember one particular day when we got stuck in the afternoon in the floodplain and only managed to get out close to dusk thanks to the help of at least 50 people organised by the Barotse King's son. When we were on our way the sun set and it was completely dark. To our unpleasant surprise another part of the flood plain had become submerged and water was so deep that even our headlights were under water most of the time (the car was equiped with an elevated air intake). We drove this way some 50 KM (30 miles) by the lights of the stars and the moon while getting worried about the irrigation canal we had to cross as there was no bridge. When we reached there we decided to go for it, the water reached half way the windscreen! but my mighty Toyota pulled thru. Even leaking through the doors was modest. Since that day I do worship this car.
The car is very reliable and strong, due to the good suspension you can drive at considerable speed (75km/40 miles) even when there is no road (on tarmac I once reached 170 km/ 106 miles ). The good suspension inviting you to drive faster than you should in rough terrain has probably caused a crack in the frame in combination with severe overloading (the car had a humongous roofrack which I since removed). In Zambia you can find real welding wizards so it was repaired. For real muddy terrain the car is too heavy, with <i>NARROW</i> tires it performs well in sand. On tarmac you should be well aware that the center of gravity is not as low as in a regular car so be careful.
