            Ram 1500 Laramie SLT 4x4 Quad Cab 5.9L V8
Upgrades: Bilstein shocks, K&N Fuel Injection Performance Kit (Gen II), Kenwood CD player w/MP3 and 10-disc changer.

I bought this truck used in Dec. 2001 with just over 32K on it, and I have added about 18K miles in almost one year.  I drive it 40 miles a day to and from work.  This is a great truck.  Through friends and co-workers, I knew the Ram trucks were great, but when I rented a 2001 model for doing landscape work around the house, I was very pleased.  I know others who own Fords and Chevys and I've rented a Ford F150 before, but none of these others can touch the Ram.

With routine oil changes and regular maintenance, I have had no problems with it during the time I've owned it.  I've kept the tranny running smooth with a fluid replacement when I bought it and again a year later.  The factor shocks are good for making the truck ride like a car, but for my tastes, I had to upgrade to stiffer Bilstein shocks.  I've loaded it with over 3200 lbs of landscaping materials, sheetrock, etc. with no problems.

The 4WD system is superb.  For this model year, only shift-on-the-floor was available, but it is very easy to engage once you know how much pressure to apply to the shift lever.  There are 4 options for the transfer case: 4-low for serious off-roading, neutral (in addition to the auto trans neutral), 2WD, and 4-high for 4WD highway use.  Shifting is much like shifting an automatic transmission, except that you have to remember 2 things: 4-high can be engaged with the vehicle moving (up to 55mph) and 4-low requires the vehicle completely stopped.  The owner's manual recommends turning the engine off if shifting into and out of 4-low is difficult.  For me, I have never had a chance to use 4-low extensively, but on my tests, I found it to be difficult with the engine running and vehicle stopped.  4-high, however, is easy to engage and disengage, and once it is engaged, you can drive at whatever speed you want.  

The interior is great; everything is laid out where they should be.  There is enough room for our two kids and their gear.  The center console is great for storage and as an armrest.  Passenger-side air bag on/off switch is a plus.  I've driven this on 4-hr road trips and the seats are very comfortable.  Hardly any exterior noise gets to the inside.  The factory speakers are great (I have the Infinity speaker system with tweaters mounted on the A-pillar).  Although the stock radio with 3-band equalizer was great, I replaced it with an aftermarket CD player that had MP3 capability and kept the factory speakers.

Would have preferred 4-wheel ABS, but only rear-wheel ABS available that year.  Braking is strong but we're also talking about the heaviest half-ton on the market.  So, it could be better.  Maybe 4-wheel disc brakes should have been an option, but since it wasn't for this model year, one can live with rear drum brakes or shell out a lot of money to upgrade them with an aftermarket upgrade kit.  Dodge finally got smart and made it an option in later models, though.

The factory jack does the job, but I would have liked a more robust one.  For a truck of this size, I was surprised that the factory jack was so small.  For those who do your own maintenance; beware, the distributor cap is very hard to reach.  You have to be very patient and have the flexibility of a wet noodle.  It took me over an hour just to get the new distributor cap back in place during my last tune-up.  That said, the rest of the engine components are very easy to get to.  For me (5'8" 145lb), I am able to literally climb into the engine bay for certain jobs.

I recommend this truck over any other to anyone thinking about buying a truck.  This is a solid, strong truck that can carry just about any load you put it to with an interior loaded with enough "creature comforts" to please just about anyone.
