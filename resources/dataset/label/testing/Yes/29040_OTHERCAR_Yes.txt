            To make this story worth telling I must explain; I am a professional drummer and doctor. I do both and need a truck, which can get me to the clinic reliably, AND which can haul some 500 pounds of drum gear to gigs in the SF Bay Area.

The CR-V does this all quite well. It is inexpensive by comparison, gives good gas mileage and is easy to drive. 

I leased the 2WD version with roof rack. I live up in the steep Oakland hills and the truck handles the drive well. I would recommend the 6 cylinder however, as I feel the 4 is a bit weak getting up the hill fully loaded.

Seating is comfortable and gives a good view of the road. Very few blind spots. The seats are comfortable, but feel a little unsubstantial. We placed "Neck Saver" brand neck supports on the seats to aid head position and limit head travel in event of an accident.

The radio and mirror controls are not positioned well and require a bit of arm twisting and leaning to operate.

We like the cargo area. It is a bit compromised by the wheel wells however. The seats go down well and the cargo area opens quite easily. Unfortunately for me, I do require a bit more cargo room than the CRV offers. I have had to use the roof rack on several occasions, and keep bungee cords in the SUV for such cases. The rack is well made and offers several tie down point options.

Overall a good choice. It does many things well. It is not pretentious. I don't think I would get a 4WD version, as I have not need for the extra traction. A 6-cylinder model would be a great choice.
