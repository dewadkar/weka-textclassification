            I recently purchased a 1992 Lexus SC300 from a private party to replace a wrecked car (not my fault, btw), after having learned I could afford one.  I have always admired their looks, and I'm very pleased to discover what a great car it is in other ways.

This is not a sports car, regardless of what you have a read or been told.  I would call it a "sport tourer" in the same vein as the Dodge Stealth (Mitsubishi 3000GT).  It shows more of the luxury car in its pedigree than the sports car.

Let's review some particulars.

DRIVETRAIN:

My car is a 5-speed, which is fairly unusual for this model year (only a few hundred were made in 1992). It rewards a manual transmission by being very aggressive, and has a lot of high-end power.  Once you hit 3rd gear, you can really feel it pull.  It's a joy to drive, with an extremely smooth inline-6 engine that makes a satisfying whining noise as if it has a supercharger (this is the normal sound of the twin cams).  Exhaust note is rumbly but subdued.  You know immediately this is not a 4-banger Honda.

The inline-6 is a non-interference engine. This means that if the timing belt snaps, you won't wrench the engine into a pile of scrap. I believe this car is still on its original belt, at 131,000 miles, although long overdue for a new one.

This car has what has been called a "bulletproof" engine and drivetrain. Basically that means that it can take a huge amount of wear and tear without needing major repair, or leaving you stranded.  Lexus is owned by Toyota, and the SC300 is the same as the Toyota Supra.  Many of the parts are totally interchangeable.

It is generally acknowledged that this car is superior in quality and reliability to its sibling, the SC400 (V8 vs. inline-6).

I have been informed by people much more knowledgeable than I about this specific car that you can put a turbo in the factory drivetrain and expect to get good life out of it, even in a car with over 100,000 miles on it.  It will reportedly handle boosts up to 500hp or so without requiring any modification of the drive train. (Update 9/3/02: I'm told that the Supra engine in this car was originally designed to handle a turbo, so adding one should not be dangerous).

SUSPENSION / HANDLING:

Braking is very firm and predictable, handling is excellent especially considering the size of the car (it's pretty big for a coupe -- about 3,600 lbs!)

It is, however, rear wheel drive.  It is also what they call "tail happy", which means it will easily drift loose around turns unless you are 1) careful, or 2) experienced in driving a RWD car.  You can mitigate this a little by getting sticky summer tires for the rear (or all around).  But generally, be aware of it.  RWD handles a lot differently from FWD.

UPDATE 10/28/02: This car has ABS, but does NOT have traction control.  You may find the rear right wheel cut loose before the left one on slick roads.  If you're used to driving a modern car with traction control, just be conservative with this car until you get used to it.

One main advantage of a RWD is that the turn radius is much smaller, making this car surprisingly easy to park and perform U-turns with.

The clutch is very stiff and may be daunting to many women.  It gets easier with time (as your leg gets stronger!) and I'd estimate it takes about 40lbs to engage the pedal.  Your legs are stronger than you think, so don't be too distressed.  Go find one of these cars yourself and check it out.

The stick shift has a feel to it that many describe as "notchy", as if you're not quite aligning the shaft with the gate correctly when you move it.  This is typical of this model, and not a defect.  It takes some time to get used to, and I would not recommend it as a "learner's" car.  After you become accustomed to the angle of the gate (I think it's angled a bit more toward the driver than many cars), it shifts smoothly.  You can also, I'm told, smooth it out with a specific brand of transmission fluid.  Check www.clublexus.com for more detailed info on this.

BODY: 

You could hang an elephant off the doors.  I took a look at mine and they are extremely over-engineered, with huge, thick hinges.  The advantage here is that the doors don't get loose or misaligned over time.  My car is 10 years old and looks and drives like new.

I have detected the beginnings of rust along the weather seal at the top outside of the windshield, which is causing the paint to bubble a bit.  I consider this a normal consequence of age, and got an estimate of about $400 to repair.  Other than this, I have not found any signs of corrosion or deterioration.  For the record, this car spent the first few years of its life in Massachusetts, where it was garaged half of the year.  The remainder of its life has been in Northern California, which tends to be gentler to cars due to a lack of subfreezing winters (no corrosive salt on the road), and little humidity compared to eastern and southern states.

The center caps on the wheels are losing paint, since they're plastic (rather than aluminum like the rims themselves), which is a minor annoyance.  A replacement set costs about $100.  Yikes.

UPDATE 7/18/02: I've been informed that the paint loss on the center caps is usually caused by wheel cleaner products, which are intended to be used on metal wheels. Since the caps are plastic, the cleaner corrodes them. Many Lexus owners solve this problem by prying the center caps off before washing the car (which can be done with the blade of a screwdriver).  Or, if you're like me, you just don't use wheel cleaner products.  The car wash soap is usually ok for me.

UPDATE 4/29/03: I was fortunate to find a replacement set of these center caps for $20 on eBay. They look brand new and it really improves the appearance of the car overall.

SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVERALL PAINT:

This car was available in a few colors with a "Pearl" characteristic.  Mine is "Diamond Pearl" (white), and it is a truly striking, rich color that is very eye-catching in the sun.  It is reputed to be nearly impossible to match, and owners often have the whole car repainted when painting is needed.  Cadillac uses a similar color on their vehicles.

Mine has the original paint and clearcoat, and it looks fantastic even 10 years later.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM:

All the electrics in my car still work, with the exception of the "memory" set for the driver's seat position. The driver's seat has an 8-way electric adjustment, including lumbar, and the controls are remarkably intuitive.  Optional bun-warmers are included in my car, and keep my posterior (and lower back!) toasty when it's cold outside.  It feels good driving home after a long day sitting in an office chair.

Sunroof is electric and has 2 positions.  It can "tilt" open to just lift the back edge, or it can retract completely to leave the ceiling open.  The opening is considerably bigger than I've seen in other cars.  There is an interior shade you can pull if you don't want any light coming through the glass when it's closed.

The owner's manual comes with instructions on how to close the sunroof manually (using a L-screwdriver included in the trunk tool kit) if it unexpectedly fails while open. It's quite easy to do.

As you would expect for a Lexus, this car has a number of minor convenience features that just make the entire experience more pleasant.  If someone needs to get into the back, you just pull the handle to release the front seat and the seat will automatically slide itself forward to make room, and then slide back again when the upright portion is returned to its normal position!

The steering wheel makes a similar adjustment.  When you turn the ignition off, the steering wheel moves itself up to make it easier to get out of the car.  It will move itself down again the next time you get in and put the key in the ignition.  The wheel itself is also electrically adjustable, up and down as well as in and out (telescoping).

The AC system is fairly painless.  You just set the temperature you want and push the knob for "automatic" and the car figures out the rest.  You can make manual adjustments to your liking.

One thing that bugs me about the AC is that it has a definite preference to using the "outside" vent option, as opposed to the "inside" recycling.  I like the inside vent because it gets cold faster and lets the fan blow stronger.  The computer seems to take any opportunity to switch it back to outside (even when you make manual adjustments), so you have to keep your eye on it.

UPDATE 4/29/03: After some experimentation and discussion with other owners of this car on clublexus.com, I have decided that the climate control system may in fact be malfunctioning (not surprising considering the age of the car). My best guess at the moment is a stuck heater core control valve, which should be easy to fix once I find it.  :)  I'll post an update once this is resolved.

INTERIOR ROOM:

You have to be pretty short to be comfortable in the front seats.  I'm 5'1" and don't have a problem.  My husband is about 5'9" and his head grazes the ceiling.  So think about that before you buy one.

The back seat is pretty spacious for a coupe, but of course lacks the room of a sedan.  Legroom is very good.  Front seats are roomy, but again, will feel cramped if you're on the tall side.

The trunk is wide across the body of the car and fairly deep, but doesn't go "in" a great deal (due to the back seat and the gas tank being right there).  It's still plenty big unless you plan on putting a canoe or something in there.  A full sized spare tire is underneath, along with a jack and a tool kit.

STEREO:

The factory option CD player with this car is a Pioneer, with a 12 disc changer mounted in the trunk. I believe that there was a Nakamichi upgrade available.  It sounds really excellent, even 10 years old, and has the unusual feature of a 10" subwoofer mounted in the rear just under the third brakelight.  It sits on top of the gas tank, which has 2 interesting effects:

1) It sounds a lot better when the gas tank is full.

2) Finding a replacement that will fit is very difficult because the depth and the mounting bracket are custom.

In addition, getting to the subwoofer itself requires the removal of the back seat.  Although this isn't hard to do, it requires 2 people and a good amount of time to go through the removal of the bulkhead behind the seat.

SECURITY SYSTEM:

The factory alarm system is reputed to be very good for a factory system.  It is relatively intelligent, and does not allow the trunk (or the glovebox) to be opened by remote. The physical key must be used.  A valet key without a remote control is available. You can use the master key to lock the glovebox, and the valet key will not open it. The valet key also will not open the trunk.  This protects your belongings in the car whenever you turn it over for service, or valet parking.

Now this is where it gets clever.  The remote control (which unlocks the doors and disarms the alarm) is integrated into the key itself.  There is a tiny button on the side of the key that you press, and voila!  I just think this is too cool.

I asked the prior owner if he had ever had any major work done on the car.  He said he had the bumper replaced after his garage door gouged it, but that was all.  No significant repairs mechanical or electric in the 3 years he owned it.

I've had the car for about 2 months now, and it has proven to be a reliable daily driver that has had only maintenance work done on it so far.  When inspected it revealed the need for new shocks and springs (not surprising in a car with 131,000 miles on it), and tires.  Minor leaks in the VC and differential gaskets were repaired, which the auto shop described as "nuisance" and not dangerous.

This car has a significant scheduled service recommended at 100,000 miles, so if you get a car around this age or older, check to see if that service has been done.  It is an expensive servicing, but must be done in order to insure the life of the vehicle.  It would include a timing belt replacement, so ask about that specifically.  A new belt will cost you about $280.

Overall I highly recommend this car as a quality used vehicle.  It has a timeless design that never goes out of style, and has a build quality that makes it a sound purchase even at 10 years old.

Update 10/28/02: I just had some major scheduled maintenance done on the car, including new belts, spark plugs, etc. Motor oil was leaking into the spark plug wells and onto the wiring harness due to old seals, which were replaced.  One link rod in the front suspension was worn out and therefore replaced.  

Also got new struts to replace worn out originals; Eibach springs and Tokico shocks (this was a planned purchase as the car is quite due for struts at this age). I should point out that even with motor oil leaking into the spark plug wells and wiring, the car still ran fine, if a bit rough!  One of the smoothest engines ever made, and is smooth as silk after the tuneup.

I had new tires put on at this time, as well.  The new ones are Dunlop SP Sport A2 (high performance all-season) replacing Firestone Affinity Touring (standard touring) in the factory size.  It's worth noting that while the Dunlop is a much superior tire, the difference in price between them is only $1.00 at tirerack.com.

Factory tire size on this car is 215/60-15, but it will accept a 225/60-15 (10mm wider) and fit correctly.  I had 225/60-15 Dunlops put on all around, and this does make a noticeable difference in the car's traction stability.

Also, the Eibach spring kit has the effect of lowering the car about 1" (which still gives a good ride and does not cause the wheels to rub on the body), and that improves the handling a lot as well, reducing body roll in turns and making the car more predictable.  Overall a much safer combination for the suspension, in my opinion.  Only caveat is to go very slow over speed bumps, as the 1" drop in the car's clearance causes the shield over the bottom of the engine to contact the speed bump more readily.  It makes an awful THUD if you go too fast, but does not damage the car as far as I can tell.  Back seat passengers may find the ride somewhat harder on a rough road.

I had the car inspected thoroughly and no other problems were found.  Car is still going strong at 135,000 miles.

UPDATE 4/29/03: Car is now on 140,000 miles and still driving problem-free.  I have routine maintenance performed, such as oil changes every 3 months using a full-synthetic name brand motor oil.

The Dunlop tires I installed are doing great at keeping traction.  We've been having some heavy rain here lately and I have not had any issues with hydroplaning, sliding, or other traction loss.
