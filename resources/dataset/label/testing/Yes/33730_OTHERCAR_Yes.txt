            As I have only owned the 2002 Buick Regal for 1 month at this point, no lasting impressions yet. However, some of you are out there trying to make a decision so wanted to help as much as possible. 
Original intent was to purchase a Toyota Camry; then began to compare to the new 2002 Nissan Altima; then brought the Regal into the fray.
My intent was to buy at some % over invoice price: following my research I found all Toyota dealers unwilling to "deal", Nissan and Buick. In the end I chose the Buick for value: at $22,300 for a fully loaded LS including leather seating (leather trim that is) and 200 HP V6 it blew the Altima out of the water at $19,800 (4 cylinder).
Toyota, although still the best ride in a mid-size, wouldn't even get in the game.
Good News: So far I am impressed with all of the Regals comforts; auto climate control works well and is responsive, including dual control option; stereo system is excellent with auto adjustment tones for various music types; super head room (I am quite tall); the 6 way adjustable power seat is super and the tilt wheel has about the best field of movement I have see on any car and is easy to operate (I like tilt wheel ever since they came out with them and I like to see easy access and wide range of motion; this is the best I have seen). WHile no sports car, it handles well, is responsive (for a American made mid-size) and the 200 HP gives plenty of pep; keyless entry & auto trunk release are nice features as are the automatic headlights
Not so good news: As this is the first time I have gone american made in 10 years, I still miss the tightness and fit (how those doors, hood and trunk close) of the Japanese or European producers; just don't believe Detroit will ever get there; the ride is sub-standard to a Toyota Camry (but I get about 40 more HP). Although in the specs, the Camry back seat supposedly has only 1 more inch of leg room, the Regal seems cramped, believe it is due to the soft padded nature of the interior; the trunk is small and no full-size spare (I hate that Detroit still uses the low weight of the dinky spares to meet its MPG requirements); the glove box is tiny and the storage space in front of the split-seat shifter is the black hole of Calcutta, I'm afraid to put anything in there as I may never retrieve it. It seems to have a fairly small range on a full tank (i.e. a small gas tank, a spec I did not look at when purchasing...or maybe I am just using that V6 a bit too much!).
