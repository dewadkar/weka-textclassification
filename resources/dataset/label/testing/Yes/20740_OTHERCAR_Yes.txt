            I am a previous owner of a 1996 Chevy Cavalier. This car was great! I had no problems with it at all. I had taken it to the dealer for it's 36,000 mile maintenance check up. While I was there, I saw a brand new 1998 Blazer LT. I liked it from the moment I saw it. Since August of 98' (when I bought the vehicle) I have had no problems with it. My only concern is the gas mileage. Of course, the Cavalier got better mileage because it was smaller with a smaller engine. But the Blazer does pretty well for a SUV. It gets about 20 miles in town, and about 27 highway....not bad at all. My fog lights burnt out quicker than I would expect them to, but other than that...no problems. The Blazer drive's great. You sit higher than an average passenger car, it has great quickness, and lots of room in the rear for all most anything. I you don't mind becoming an Exxon preferred customer, the Blazer is your pick. However, if you are looking for gas mileage......think again. Over all, I give it 2 thumbs up!<br><br>
