            I bought the 2001 Ford Focus Wagon SE in mid April, I have just around 3200 miles on it.  I bought it for hauling groceries and kids & to get back & forth to work.  So far it has served its purpose well.  I'm used to a 6 cylinder Olds so the pick up and engine performance made me adjust my style of driving some; a manual transmission option (automatic was standard) might have been a consideration for me.  There is a funny power problem just around 50 mph it seems to either stick or actually drain a bit. I've seen this mentioned in other reviews by people with more knowledge of how things work.  When I first got my vehicle I started looking for things in the manual only to find that the index will tell you it is on say page 52 but when you get to page 52 it is about say brake fluid instead of windshield wipers! I guess I should take it back to the dealer & complain! But it is very roomy, so far it has transported a huge treadmill, a new hot water heater & the topper-- a bull mastif, doberman, jack russell, border collie, 2 adult men & two children all at the same time!
