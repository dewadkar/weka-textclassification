                    I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.
       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

   Step right up and see it for yourself, it is a freak of nature, you can only see it here, don't be afraid it wont hurt you. Huh ??  Yes the Mazda Miata suspension is a freak. It is one of the only fully adjustable suspensions, not only in it's class, but in any class of vehicle to be found.

     In these days of technological &quot;advancement&quot; you see less and less of newer vehicle suspension design being completely adjustable. The only way this is considered a good thing is for the after market tool and kit manufacturers, so they can profit when your vehicle needs alignment adjustment that is not allowed from the factory. $$$  Design a kit and everything will be fine. Except you are the one holding the bill.

    The Mazda Miata is intelligently designed with all of the available angles adjustable, caster, camber, and toe on front, and camber and toe on the rear. And not only that, but every adjustment in easily done from the lower control arms via a set of cams. A lot of cars, though adjustable, will put their adjustment hardware in such odd and hard to get at places, that the less than consientious alignment tech will not even bother trying. This leaves you with a car that will still ill handle and wear tires.

     The suspension seems rock solid with a combination of strut type mounting and coil over shock absorbing, but the factory shock absorbers do tend to wear out fast. Is is very stable and inspires confidence by the fact that it doesn't feel like a typical little car suspension, but a very quality unit.

  The Miata has become a favorite with small scale racers like the autocross crowd, and what that means to you is there are myriad places where you can find after market parts, both interior and exterior to suit your customization wants. Racing suspensions, alloy wheels, body panels, you think it up and someone makes it. Point your search engine to Mazda Miata and there will be site upon site of information.

   Read the other reviews on the Miata, find out if this is what you want from the other aspects of the car, and be confidant the under car of the Miata will take care of you and will leave you with no surprises.<br><br>
