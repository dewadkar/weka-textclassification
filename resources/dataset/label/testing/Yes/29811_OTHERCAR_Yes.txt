            My wife and I had triplets girls this year.  We bought the Kodak DC-260 and have not been disappointed at all.  It takes great pictures, and we've taken around 500 shots thus far.  Color, clarity, and vividness are outstanding!  You will not be disappointed with this camera.  One thing I would also recommend you get if you have any digital camera is a CD-R/W drive.  Remember, there are no negatives.  If your hard drive crashes so do all your great photos!<br><br>
