            What is there not to like. It's the most affordable subcompact car on the market today. With an average of 34 - 37mpg it gives more for every dollar you spend. With the EX model you get all the extra's plus a 127hp under the hood. Enough to give you the power to accelerate through traffic. Including the sporty look of this car there is no denying that this is mostly favored by the young at heart. So go ahead and test it you won't regret it.  <br><br>
