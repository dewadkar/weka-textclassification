            BMW sure made a winner with the 2001 X5.  It catches everyone's eye when you drive it down the street.  If you're concerned the car will ride like a truck, it doesn't.  It designed to move and feel like a car with the performance of a sports car.  Actually the car is not an SUV, it's a SAV, or Sport Activity Vehicle.  The SAV has an an aggressive exterior and fat tires.  This says the car can carry more than 5 people and their baggage.

The X5 comes in two models: the 3.0 Liter V6 and the 4.4 Liter V8.  I recommend the V8 because it is a better choice for hauling the X5's 4800 lbs.  The X5 packs a large punch with a quick acceleration and a lot of passing power.  However, the car averages between 13 and 15 MPG.  Another downfall is that the car requires premium fuel.

When you finally take the X5 on the road you never want to leave.  The large tires and heavy suspension make the X5 the best handling SUV on the road.  Yet, a rough ride is sometimes noticeable.  The large tires contribute to some noise inside the cabin.  The X5's steering responds to the slightest turning.  The 5 speed automatic transmission shifts extremely well and includes Steptronic for clutchless manual shifting.

The X5 provides a large assortment of luxury and electronics in the cabin.  The steering wheel is even electronically operated.  The front seats are extremely comfortable.  The X5's sound is one of the best.  It's only flaw is the tendency to fade in sunlight.  The tall rear seats and headrests cause poor visibility.  The SAV does have a large viewable area in their side view mirrors.  One feature the side view mirrors have is that they automatically angle down when the car is put into reverse.  

I'll now outline some of the standard and optional equipment for the 4.4 Liter V8 model.  

The standard equipment is air conditioning, alarm, on-board computer, anti-lock brakes, leather door trim panels, AWD, V8, Keyless remote entry, fog lights, garage door opener, light wood interior trim, AM/FM stereo with cassette, power and leather seats, leather power steering wheel, automatic transmission, and power windows.

The optional equipment is the activity and the sport package.  Also, other optional equipment is the moon roof, privacy glass, xenon headlights, lumbar support, navigation system, premium audio with digital sound, and heated rear seats.
