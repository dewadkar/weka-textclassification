            I love convertibles, and I have owned hundreds, I collect them, I drive them, I restore them..... But when I finally found my first Dodge Dakota Convertible, I was hooked. I like trucks, and up till then, all I had to choose from were the older style 1969 to 1972 Blazers and then the 1973-1975 Blazers...  Okay there are Bronco's and Scouts..... and a few others, but non compare to the ease and convienance of the Dakota. Maybe 30 sec's and your top is either up or down..... The bed allows me to bring home the garage sale goodies, the mileage is good, about 20 mpg on my two wheel drive, and yes, I also found a four wheel drive. I have made them the center of my collection focus, and will never be without one now. I even found a third I am negotiating for right now, that is almost like new.... 

Whether you are a man or woman, old or young, this is a great vehicle. Best of all, they are appriciating rapidly, buy one now, and enjoy it as your investment grows in value.... When's is the last time you had that happen with a used car?

The seem to range from $6500 to near $10,000 for premium units, so getting one now is affordable. They were around $18,000+ new, and since there was only 28xx something in 1989 and 1039 in 1990, they have the right production numbers to be quite valuable later down the road.

Well best of luck on your search, and if you have any other questions concerns or trivia, e-mail me. I can point you to the latest Dakota convertible web sights.    <br><br>
