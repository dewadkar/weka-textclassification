            I really enjoy driving and I enjoy driving in comfort.  While this isn't the most stylish car out on the roads today, it's still a nice stable car.  Ahhh, so there's a few things wrong with the car, but I have to say that I really enjoy the reliability my Mazda provides.

Oh, before I forget, will somebody phone an exorcist please? Because while I drive, my automatic seatbelts like to jerk around infrequently. While my husband insists it's an electrical problem (&quot;most likely related to the removed security system&quot;, he claims), it's still pretty freaky to experience. It's annoying, at best, though, not inhibiting or dangerous in the least.

The car I received (yes, it was a gift... thanks, mom) features Economy Driving. It claims to save gas by &quot;de-powering&quot; your car a few degrees. The good thing is that I haven't noticed any significant decrease in power when this feature is activated. The bad thing is that I haven't noticed any significant increase in my gas mileage when this feature is activated. 

I *do* wish my car had airbags. Mazda didn't start adding this feature until 1993, however. 

All in all, there's not a lot of problems this little car has had during its nine-year life. Really! This is the perfect car for somebody who's looking for &quot;just four-wheels to get around in&quot; (not me) or for somebody who wants to remain low-profile (not me).

Reliability counts, though, and I keep this car PURELY for that reason.
