            The Hewlett Packard Photo Smart C200 Digital Camera is a budget conscious wonder of engineering.  I was able to unpack the camera, load the batteries and take pictures within 10 minutes.  Crystal clear digital images are possible that would amaze the avocational 35MM buff, and the graphic delivery certainly is more than adequate and convenient for internet uploading. My background in conventional photography would typically find me suspicious of the range possible within the digital arena, however I'm encouraged with the future of digital photography if Hewlett Packard was able to develop such a respectable platform at such a reasonable price. 

 The purchaser should be aware of several limitations.  I found that the C200 delivers the most effective results when photos are taken on the &quot;Super-Fine&quot; setting.  The camera offers three settings, with progressive improvements in the image, according to the numbers 1,2 or 3 (three being optimum).  The finer the setting logically the less photos can be stored in the memory card, however this is not a large concern, since the photos can be easily downloaded and the memory card reused.  Digital cameras 'suck the life' out of batteries, so rechargeable batteries and battery charger are a good secondary investment. 

 Unfortunately the HPC200 does not come with an AC Adapter, although one is available separately.  The adapter, sold separately, is 'pricey' and fairly specific as far as it's electrical configuration, so the wise consumer may want to avoid a generic model that may damage the camera.  Finally, and at the low price point this drawback may be forgiven, the manual lighting settings are awkward to manage, since they are arbitrary arrow buttons that cause the photo to become gradually lighter or darker.
