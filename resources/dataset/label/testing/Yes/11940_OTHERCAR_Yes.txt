            I purchased my camera on the Internet. I purchased it simply because I really wanted a relatively inexpensive Digital Camera. That was one of many criteria that this met, LCD viewing, Instant view of pictures taken,ability to delete pictures that you don't want instantly and many other features.

I choose this particular camera over others due to ease of use. I even purchased an additional Smart Media 8mg photo-disk. The camera is fairly simple too use. The only thing that it does not have, although you can read it on line once you install the software, is a manual. I would highly recommend reading first the basics on &quot;Taking Pictures&quot; so you don't have fuzzy pictures on your first set. Overall I would highly recommend the camera.<br><br>
