            I bought this Sidekick Sport about 3 years ago because I wanted a real 4X4 with more room for the parts and manuals I carry as part of my job. I also wanted to be able to tow small loads (2 snowmobiles), which the Escort I had at the time would not safely do-the owners manual recommends against towing anything with the Escort. At the same time, I wanted an economical vehicle that got better mileage than the standard sized SUV's on the market, as I have a 40 mile commute to my service area and then can put another 30-40 miles a day driving around the city. My Sidekick has filled my needs very well in the 3 years and 90,000 miles I have driven it (mileage now at 116,100).
Before I bought the 'Zuk, I compared it to the following vehicles-Kia Sportage: Possibly the shortest test drive in history. The Sportage has more power and is slightly more roomy inside, but somehow feels less comfortable. The reliability of the Sportage is terrible-a coworker has had his new Sportage in the shop more in the few months he has owned it than any car should spend there-it's good that he has a really good warranty becuase he will apparently need it! Honda CRV: More like a tall station wagon than an SUV. No low range available. I don't use the the low range all that often, but when I do, there is no substitute. More expensive RAV4:Same as the CRV but what happened to the rear bumper? 
Reliability has been excellent. In those 90K miles, I have replaced one set of tires, one set of brake pads,2 air filters and 2 sets of spark plugs. The only real problem I have is that it sometimes won't start at -20 if I haven't put some kind of heater under the hood to warm the engine, if it doesn't start right up at that kind of temperature the engine will flood and you end up having to remove the spark plugs to let them dry out. All service items are easily accessible under the hood. The 1.8L engine uses a timing chain instead of a belt so there is no scheduled replacement at 60K miles or so. At 116K, the engine uses about a quart of oil between oil changes at 5 to 7K. Suzukis are built tough, for third world conditions, with full ladder frames, heavy duty suspension and drivetrains, and my 'Zuk shows every sign of lasting forever.
Fuel economy ranges from 26 in the summer to 22 in the winter with the hubs locked. Best ever mileage was 29 on a long highway trip and worst was 18 towing snowmobiles on a road with some really nasty long hills. Driving comfort is pretty good, seats are on the firm side (the veloure fabric doesn't show any wear yet) but rear seat passengers are going to need short legs. In 4WD, this rig blasts through the snow and handles icy roads really well, although sudden stops will cause the rear end to come around, which is typical of short wheelbase SUV's. Tim Allen types needing more power will not be happy here-the engine is adequate but not astounding. Road noise is higher than some similar vehicles. My rig has power windows, remote entry and security system, power mirrors, A/C and a pretty good heater. The Sport model uses 16" wheels instead of the more typical 15" wheels, which causes problems when trying to fit more agressive tires. There aren't any good A/T tires for 16" rims that will fit well on the Sidekick, so I modified my brake calipers to fit under the 15" rims and mounted up some Copper Discoverys, which I have been very happy with. 
For some unknown reason, most professional auto reviewers don't like the Sidekick or Tracker. Suzuki owners know better. They quietly enjoy the reliable, rugged and economical SUV's produced by Suzuki and ignore the pros.
