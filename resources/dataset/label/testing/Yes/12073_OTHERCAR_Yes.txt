            When I decided to buy a new truck I researched and test-drove every maker of small trucks, and several different dealers of a few of them.  My requirements were reliability, comfort, price, looks, and capability, in that order.  The Toyota 4x4 pickup won out far above any of its competitors, and I drove one home.  Still have it after 9 years, and still contend it is the best vehicle I have ever known.  Here is how it met my requirements:

Reliability: I know absolutely nothing about mechanics and repair - I needed something with a reputation for NOT breaking down.  In talking with truck owners and with auto mechanics, Toyota had the best reputation by far, and I have had very little problems with my truck.  Besides standard maintenance, the only time it has been in the shop is for a new starter, just last year.  It now has 164,000 miles on it, and I expect at least another 100M before I trade it in.

Comfort: This was important to me - I wanted a small truck, but I am a BIG person!  The Toyota was the only truck I drove that did not squish my left arm against the door panel.  One downside I will mention: I am average height and adjust the seat all the way back.  Anyone with longer legs might feel cramped.

Price:  When new, this truck was at the top of my price range, but I decided to make that sacrifice in hopes that my other requirements would be met beyond my needs - and they have been.  The resale value of a Toyota pickup that has been well cared for is higher than most other comparable trucks too - a fact that speaks well of the truck all by itself.

Looks:  This is a VERY sporty-looking truck!  I would be lying if I said that how the truck looked and how I looked in the truck did not play some small part in my decision to buy it.

Capability:  I took my truck out the day after I brought it home, just to see what it would do.  It does lack power going up sustained inclines, but pulls a trailer with relative ease.  In 4-wheel-drive mode it has taken me many places I should not have been, and pulled other trucks out of mud, snow, and other predicaments without getting itself stuck.  I drove off the end of a ridge that first day - scared the snot out of me, but the truck handled it perfectly.  I learned that my Toyota truck was capable of a lot more than I had the nerves to do!

My Toyota has been a great vehicle and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a used small pickup.  If you can find one, that is: most owners, like myself, are still driving theirs and have no intention of getting rid of them any time soon!
