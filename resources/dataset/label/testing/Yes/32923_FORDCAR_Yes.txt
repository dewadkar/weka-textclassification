            Where have I been all this time?  Learning how to get along as a divorced guy!

When this happens one tends to reduce expenses while trying to find new and creative ways to increase income.  It can be a very interesting time in your life.

In the process I have found myself trading vehicles again.  I cut my F-150 in half.  I bought a 2000 Ford Ranger XLT Super-Cab with four doors.  Well, it's not really four &quot;doors&quot; as such, it's two doors with two access panels made of the back half of the cab.  It's really quite nice when you want to get to things in the back area.

Granted, this is not the vehicle for you if you intend on actually getting in the back half of the cab.  It might be a little claustrophobic for me.  I'm comfortable in the front.  I am 5'10&quot; tall and wear a 32&quot; waist so it works out nice for me.  I can't see a very heavy person enjoying this ride though.

This little truck has done very well since March when I bought it.  It's returning fair fuel economy (16.456mpg) for it's engine and trans. package (3.0L V6,4sp Auto).  It rides comfortable.  It looks nice.  It was affordable too.  I have had Rangers before, in fact I have had a lot of vehicles in my life time.  For me a good vehicle is one that gives good service and is affordable.  This Ranger is what I'd call a good vehicle.  I enjoyed the bigger truck but alas change can be good.  I have no complaints what-so-ever.

I'd highly recommend this type of equipment to anyone interested in good daily transportation.  It's no monster truck that will tow a broke down Winnebago up a steep hill but it will haul you happy hiney to work and back with ease.  It's great for hauling small loads yet has a car feel to it.

As my grandfather once said; &quot;lawn tractors mow lawns, they don't plow fields.&quot;  If your looking for a big work rig, look at the F-350 with the PowerStroke diesel.  Don't but a Ranger if you need a work truck.  Don't buy a work truck if you need daily transportation.<br><br>
