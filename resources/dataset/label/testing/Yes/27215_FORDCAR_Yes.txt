            I feel in love with this car upon my first test drive!  We had been looking for a while to purchase a car, and were looking for something not to small, not to big, with just the right sized price!  We test drove many cars, from the Stratus, to the Oldsmobiles, to a VW bug!  We just couldn't decide what to do!

Then we decided to look at another Ford dealer..  And the salesman, recommended the Focus, and they had just gotten a new shipment, so we would be able to see a few different models, from the 2 door, to a 3 door (2 doors and a hatch!), to the 4 and 5 (4 doors and a hatch!) door model!  We decided we wanted a 4 door car, and did not really care for the hatch, but we loved the big roomy trunk on the the 4 door model!  So off we went to drive and test how well the car handles.

The car is great!  It handles corners smoothly, almost as smooth as walking!  Bumps, no problems, the suspension system is great! And I love knowing that if it does break down, Ford gives you a 3 year road plan, not only do they tow and fix your car under warranty, they give you a free rental car for the duration of the repair!  Other perks under their new leasing options, are free car seats for children, (and they match your cars interior!) scheduled maintenance is provided, and you are given a rental car if it is expected to take more than 30 minutes!

I have yet to find a negative in the car other than the size of the backseat!  There is not much leg room back there, although the front is roomier than the average full sized car, that we drove!   If you have children, this may not be the car for you, but for a newly married couple, this was the best car for our needs!
