            I bought my 1999 Kia Sephia last October after my previous car was totaled.  I bought the Kia because I could get a new car with a decent warranty for only a couple thousand more then a used car with no warranty.  Kia usually has a nice cash back incentive on their cars.  When we bought ours it was $1500.
     We have had the car 8 months now and I have to say its been a pretty nice little car.  There was a recall on the fuel filter shortly after we got it but it was fixed quickly.   We also had a problem with the molding around the windshield but this was fixed when we had the windshield replaced (a stone hit it while driving down the road).  The gas mileage is good.  Radio is nice.  I regret not getting the power package but there were none on the lot when I bought the car.  
    The car is small.  It will fit 4 people or 3 and a car seat.  The steering wheel doesn't tilt and that is annoying.  The trunk is pretty spacious for such a little car.
      We have had no mechanical problems yet and we has 16,000 miles on the car.<br><br>
