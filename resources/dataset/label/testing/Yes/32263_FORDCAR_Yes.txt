            We had a 2000 Ford Taurus SE for about a year, but a long road trip with our 3 children taught us that we needed more room. A quick search on the internet led us to the Ford Dealer for a 2001 SE Sport.
 
I chose the sport for it's sharper looks(Spoiler, Fog lights, 16" wheels), and quad captains chairs. We chose Black, as the only color options in 2001 for the Sport were Red, Blue, Silver, White, and Black. All the other colors still had black for the accent trim, while the black just looked more uniform.

We had the TV/VCR installed as well as an auto-dimming rear view mirror installed as a dealer option. There are a lot of convenience features in this vehicle. There are turn signals in the mirror that double as an exterior "side door open" warning to other drivers. There are 2 cargo nets for loose items, one up front, and the other across the back. Grocery hooks on are the back seat for bags. The drivers seat is 6 way adjustable with lumbar, and very comfortable. There is also a 12V power point in the rear for an accessory or tailgate parties....a nice touch. Also nice is the fact the radio doesn't shut off until you leave the vehicle. This gives you time to hear the last bit of the song, or commentary without running the motor. It shuts off after 15 mins or when the door is opened.

The van is tops for saftey, beating the Chrysler and GM products by a wide margin. Traction control and side airbags ensure our safety....Ford is easily the best domestic make in this regard.

This van has some guts though. The 200HP 3.8 is very fast(For a minivan), and has lots of towing torque. It's a bit of a gas pig though, but the huge gas tank (98L) gives great range. I put a K&N filter in, and got a bit more range out of it.

The bad news is that there have been a few recalls, but nothing major. There was also a squeak in the dash, and the engine light came on, but they we both fixed under warranty, with an Escape provided when the engine light took longer than expected.
