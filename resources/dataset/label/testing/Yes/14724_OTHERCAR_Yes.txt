            I just recently got one of these from an auctions. I only paid $395 so I cant really complain about it But I wish people would stop asking me if its a camcorder!!!!

As with all digitals batteries will cost you more than regular film, so use some that you can recharge. And get the ac adapter so you can download without depleting your batteries.

Pictures are realy good and software easy if not very fast.

The camera looks solidly build and is more than attractive,  also the unique shape of the camera makes it a lot more comfortable to hold than a typical camera ( digital or not) as you can stroll with your hand down knowing you are not about to drop-it. 

Easy to use menu and direct television viewing is possible.

Amazing style, ease of operations makes this one of the better amateur digital on the market!!


Not bad even for $500!!

The optical lens is also very good being from a real Lens manufacturer ( they also make the Contax Lenses!! )
