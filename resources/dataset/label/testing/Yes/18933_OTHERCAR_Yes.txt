            The brothers Mitsi and Bishi - hey?..whats that?..come of the grass - nobody in Japan has a name that long - Mitsubishi!, hardly. They all have names like Tojo, Ono, Yoko and Uno - do they not?

Anyway, when they decided to build the worlds best car, and a car the peasants could afford they had one major problem. Which country had the alibility, the acumen, the intellect, the talent and genius to design and build such a vehicle.

For some time they were stymied, and then, being both visionaries it hit them like a bolt from the blue. Now remember this is in the early 1980's.

It would have to be a country that could run an Olympics, the very best in the world, with one arm tied behind their backs and just a weeks notice, and where else - Australia.
And even better they already had a factory in the very best part of the country, that being Adelaide of course. (please don't get the idea there is any bias in this review).
Well a quick phone call to the Aussi Manager and they new they could go back to their Sushi and Saki.

Of course, in no time, there it was, the best car in the world and cheap enough for almost anyone to afford.

But a sad, sad event was soon to occur. Overseas terrorists..er tourists would come to Australia and rent one of these prize vehicles, but when the time came to return it they had to be physically removed - some even swallowed the keys!

The only answer of course was to export it around the world, and so it was done.

The real name of the vehicle is Magna, but in deference to various cultures around the world this is varied. For instance in Japan its called Magnasun, in Italy the Magnalisa and in the USA the Galant to avoid any reference to a Gun.

Much of the technical detail is highly classified, but the following dis-information has been released;

five models: DE, ES, ES-V6, GTZ-V6 and LS-V6
optional All Weather Package that includes heated power side mirrors and a traction control system -  ES Premium Package and ES-V6 Premium Package. 
3.0 liter V6 that boasts 195 horsepower and 205 lb.-ft. of torque.  

4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. 
Standard features include power door locks and windows, child safety locks and height adjustable seatbelts. A power sunroof is optional (not available on DE and standard on LS and GTZ models). 

Please don't get too carried away with the above specifications. Its not the bald figures that mean much - its the harmony in which they work together.

Where others roar, the Galant sings - silent, oozing power in total comfort. Experience is the only teacher.

So head off to your nearest Mitsubishi Dealer, and don't forget your check book - you are going to need it.
Or take advantage of 5 year 1.9% financing.

Seriously folk, I have often driven almost all models and for smoothness and quietness they are very hard to beat. The old four cylinder was a little slow but the  V6 gives real stab in the back performance.

I believe the only reason the Magna is 3rd. in Australia is that the other two contenders are a bit bigger. That is not say the Magna..whoops Galant is small - after all it carries five with ease.
