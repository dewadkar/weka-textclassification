            One of North America's all time favourite sedans is the Toyota Camry.  It is the ideal choice of the growing family, however, what about those that want the elegance and dependability of the Camry but live more efficient and economical.  Problem solved!  It is the redesigned 2003 Toyota Corolla, which definitely looks like a miniature Camry; the real question is �Can you really get this much car into this much car?

At first glimpse, it certainly looks that way!  Longer, wider, and taller than its �02 ancestor, this 9th generation Corolla rides on a 102.4-inch wheelbase with an overall length of 178.3 inches.  Overall, the Corolla is four inches longer than the small-car segment leading Honda Civic and six inches longer than Volkswagen's sporty Jetta! Still Corollas have rigid competition among some of the contenders that is much better equipped at comparable prices and offering highly competitive warranties to offset the Corolla's famous reliability.

However, have Toyota�s fresh, new, Corolla with higher equipment levels and an impressive stab at luxury-car exterior accents and interior atmosphere win over these lucrative buyers?  Although it has been unkindly described by Car and Driver�s Fred Gregory as seeming to be like "a shrunken Malibu", Toyota hopes Corolla's new flare will evoke something high-class of the typical small-car with three trim levels; CE, LE & S.

Unknown to many, the Corolla comes into shape at Toyota�s Cambridge Ontario manufacturing plant, being recognized as a world-class factory winning many awards of excellence.  This also aids in being the world's top-selling car of all time, with 25 million units sold in 142 countries, and approximately 39% of all Corollas built found a home here in North America.

On April 23, 2002 I test drove the 2003 Corolla CE model and was very impressed as a whole, which has the familiar all-aluminium 1.8 litre, twin-cam, 16-valve engine found in earlier models.  Adding Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence (VTT-I) increases the output by five horsepower to 130 and 125 pound-feet of torque by using a new fiber-reinforced intake manifold, which includes a plenum.  I experienced the optional 4-speed automatic that had a strong launch, with power spread evenly across the torque curve.  Out on the open road I noticed the extra weight offers up a ride that is very Camry renowned.  The engine is a little noisy first when starting from city speed to highway, but according to the dealership this should subside when the engine is "broken in." As for safety, I noticed the dual-stage airbags that are standard for front-seat passengers, as are belt pretensioners and anchor points for child restraint seats built in.  It had full instrumentation, digital clock, accessory power outlet, driver�s coin case compartment, front & rear cup holders, dual vanity mirrors, fadeout dome lamp and a centre console box that will hold approx. 12 compact discs.  Other package for the CE model include Package �B� with air conditioning, keyless entry, and power locks all at an additional cost of $2000.00 more than the model I test drove.

The lavished interior has AM/FM/CD stereo, four speakers and a rear roof mounted antenna.  Fold down rear seats with 60/40 split, 3-spoke steering wheel, tilt steering and driver & front passenger seatbelt warning.  All-weather floor mats are optional unfortunately because even though carpet floor mats are included, it is nice to keep the water off the carpeted mats to reduce mildew.  Other than that, there is little to complain about.  Moving to the exterior you will find full wheel covers, side & rear window defoggers with timer, fuel cap hanger, coloured bumpers, tinted glass, power remote windows, intermittent wipers and front/rear splash guards.

Toyota says, the new Corolla has a total passenger volume of 90.3 cubic feet, and of direct competitors, only Ford's Focus provides more.  Not only is the new Corolla roomier, but also once inside you feel the Camry influence all around you and with more glass, it gives a commanding view in all directions. I personally found the seats to be more comfortable and supportive and it has a richer-feeling than any of its predecessors that I have driven.  However, importantly the rear seats have good room for 2 adults or 3 kids, and a generous 13.6 cubic feet of cargo space. Needless to say, I was very impressed with this 9th generation Corolla and I am now waiting for my desired colour to arrive at the dealership, so keep checking back to see long-term reports on owning the �03 model.

Now the 2003 Toyota Corolla offers more of everything, including size, features, and a lot more finesse, you cannot go wrong by saying; Toyota's ''great little car'' is all grown up!
