                 Bmw has added another killer to the 5 series line-up this year as they reveal the new M5 which packs 400 hp into the hood of the 5 series.  The M5 has a 4.4 liter, double overhead cam v-8 engine that performs like a champion as it gushes out 369 lb-ft of torque and 400 bhp.  Wow! this mean sports sedan does a whooping 0-60 run in 5.8 secs...that's fast for a 5 passenger sedan.. 
     What do you get when you combine the 5 series and the Bmw M(Bmw's performance division) ?  The new M5.... which pertains to luxury, refinement, and most of all performance.  The difference between the M5  and the other models of the 5 series is that it comes with a more aggressive body cladding, 18 inch wheels, and a 6 speed manual transmission.  In addition to the awesome performance of the M5, Bmw also assures safety with top notch features such as traction control, dynamic stability control, dynamic brake control for quick braking response, and rain-sensing windshield wipers...That's BMW safety, and the best part is that it's all included in the standard package. Bmw also attaches a 2 day driver's training course at Bmw's performance center when you purchase the M5...odd..However, you have to expect the measures when your behind the wheels of a 400 hp vehicle.  
     Don't forget luxury, they didn't leave that out either as the M5 defines pure luxury with power up-down windows, power adjustable tilt steering wheel, front side impact airbags, and zenon headlights.  Still not enough...take a test drive for yourself as you will agree that this car means business and it has an engine to literally die for.. <br><br>
