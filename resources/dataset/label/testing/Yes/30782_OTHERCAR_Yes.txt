            I bought this camera about 9 months ago and was impressed enough to buy one for my father as a gift (which was a mistake, because he's a technoidiot and even though the D340 is simple to use, it still requires some technical know-how).  

The best part of this camera, aside from price, is the image resolution.  Its quite good, though I don't think its as good as normal photo quality.  I also like the LCD viewer on the back of the camera, which is handier than I expected.  I've taken this camera all over the US and Europe and I probably have deleted more pictures after taking them than I've kept.  That's the real beauty of these cameras--you can snap away and never have to pay for bad pictures.

All is not well, though.  The camera eats up batteries.  I am lucky to get two &quot;rolls&quot; from one set of batteries.  The controls on the camera are also difficult to figure out and the buttons tend to be too small, oddly shaped and have a bad feel.  The main button is particularly bad...I often have to hold it down for a very long time to get it to take the picture.  Finally, you have to be very careful with how you hold the camera.  Any little movement will really blur the picture.  It may not sound like a big deal, but when the shutter button is so difficult to depress smoothly it takes on new meaning.

Overall, though I'm impressed with what this camera can do.  For a relatively new technology it has very few drawbacks.  <br><br>
