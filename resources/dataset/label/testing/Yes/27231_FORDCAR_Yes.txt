            I recently had to make a vehicle change.  While I loved my 2000 Lincoln LS, unemployment forced me to find a car with a smaller payment.  I went back to my Ford dealer (as usual) and took a look at the vehicles that Ford was offering a 0% interest loan on. My choices were limited as I wanted a small payment.  I took a 2001 Focus SE Wagon for a test drive and was quite surprised.  This car is peppy for a four cylinder (of course not the power I was used to in my V-8 LS) but not bad for a small car.  This car had the VTEC 16-Valve engine which gave it a little more power than the standard Focus.  The car is well stocked with a lot of standard features.  Power windows, locks, cruise tilt, AC, automatic, CD player, etc.  I choose the wagon to give me more room for the dog and hauling a few things home from the nursery.  I have owned a lot of Fords and the primary reason is their dependability.  I also like their fit and finish.  I find it to be the best of any car out there.  Ford has been good to me and in the 10 new Fords I have had in the last 8 years, I have never had a problem with any of them.  I just get bored with cars every so often and have to have a new one. The Focus is a lot of car for the money.  I have rented them before and was impressed. I suggest taking a look at it before you buy any foreign car.  You'll be surprised.
