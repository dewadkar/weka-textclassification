            After my Chrysler minivan finally bit the dust, I was in the market for a new vehicle.  I was pretty sure I wanted/needed a pickup truck since I live on a farm, but commuting 35 miles to work with a four-door 4X4 dually was tiresome.  I wandered around the dealership with visions of dollar signs floating out of my purse...those trucks are expensive!  As I was heading out the door I saw a car; MY car!  It was love at first sight.  Sighing, I left, knowing that a convertible like this was totally impractical...I'd never get in my driveway in the winter.  After searching the Net, I found it had front-wheel drive.  That clinched it - I called the dealer and handed over a check.

I love the way this car handles.  It's sporty without being pretentious.  The sound system is incredible and the heating and A/C are both more than adequate.  Trunk room is substantial for a car this size and there is plenty of back seat room too.  The only thing I would have changed is the roof.  The white one shows too much dirt &amp; wear; black would be better.

Driving this car is heavenly; punch the cruise and settle back for your destination.  My car has required minimal maintenance and has made it into the driveway every time - even through 3 foot drifts.  I don't know anyone who wouldn't love this car.<br><br>
