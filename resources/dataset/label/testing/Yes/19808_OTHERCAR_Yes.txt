                 I placed my order for the Mercury Cougar in the end of January 2000, and it was FINALLY ready for me to pick up last week. Lemme tell ya', I just love this ride!  I ordered a dark tourmaline green 2000 Cougar, automatic V6. The interior is greystone cloth.  The standard equipment includes front airbags, anti-theft system, air, power windows/ locks/ mirrors, 15&quot; alloy wheels, and AM/FM cassette. I decided to get all the extras (minus the leather seats--bad with little doggy claws-- and a moon roof and trunk mounted CD player, which I just didn't want).  So, I ordered the V6 Sport Group including front fog lamps, leather wrapped shift knob/ steering wheel, rear spoiler, etc.  And I couldn't do without the Convenience Group: speed control, rear washer/ wiper, remote keyless entry, illuminated entry.  Some other added options, which I would consider must haves were auto overdrive transaxle, ABS, traction lock, engine block heater, and side airbags.  As far as enhancing the &quot;look&quot; of the car (and let's face it, if you're buying this car you're at least minutely concerned with image...), I upgraded to the 16&quot; machined aluminum wheels (normal being 15&quot; aluminum &quot;matte&quot; wheels).  That added another $250 to the bill, which normally I would think was ridiculous for tires and rims, but it makes a huge difference in the appearance of the Cougar. (I also found out the 2nd day I had the Cougar how expensive the tires are...someone at a store who apparently doesn't like police officers, slashed my tire.  None of the tire stores carry the low profile tires for the newer Cougars in stock, so I had to hobble around on a donut for several days waiting for a new one, setting me back another $150...).  Any-hoo, I also got the body side molding to save against door dings. I would recommend that you go all out with the extras if buying new, because hey, you only live once...and more importantly, it will increase the resale value when you decide to part with this cat. If I had to do it all o<br><br>
