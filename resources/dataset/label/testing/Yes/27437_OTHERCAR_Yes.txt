            One of my good friends owns a Neon. I have ridden in her neon through icy snowstorms and in town and on the open road. We managed to fit 4 people, 4 snowboards and 4 bags of clothes in the tiny car for a snowboard trip but we weren't very comfortable. The 60/40 rear folding seat made it easy to put the snowboards in but two people couldn't fit well with half the seat being taken up. 

One of her doors became stuck one night at the local ski area. We had to push on the inner plastic part that surrounds the door to get it dislodged. I was quite annoyed by that aspect. Also, since the window has no extra metal piece on top where it meets the car when the door is shut, it tends to fall down and leak air so it needs to be tightened each time the door is opened. 

I love the front and back ends. They are in a very appealing design. 

Overall the design is for a small car, so that's why it doesn't hold much. I just think it's a little flimsy. Handling seems to be okay but I haven't driven it persay.<br><br>
