            I recently shopped for a new car, and the Acura TL was on my &quot;short list&quot;, along with the Lincoln LS, Chrysler 300M and BMW 3-series. The objective: as much performance and luxury as possible for around $30k.

In short: if $30,000 had truly been my absolute limit, I would have purchased this car.  It's a great value.  Now for the details.

1) Exterior styling:  looks good from back and sides.  Front looks too much like the Honda Civic.  Nothing against the Civic, but it's a much more downscale car, so no Acura should look like it.  Fit and finish are excellent.

2) Interior styling:  excellent.  Very Lexus-like.  Loved the heater and stereo controls.  Everything is is logically oriented and upscale.  The wood is fake, but for $28,000, I don't think that's a crime.

3) Stereo:  the five speaker, 150 watt Bose system is good.  Not excellent, but good.  In dash CD player is included and they even give you a special place in the dash to stash some disks.

4) Bonus:  there is only one option on this car:  the $2,000 navigation system.  All else is standard, including leather, moonroof, automatic climate control and Bose audio with CD.  That makes shopping easy:  just find the color you like.  Unless you really, really need a nav system, I would not get it.  It takes up so much space in the dash that the normally well-designed stereo and climate controls get shrunk down to something much less attractive and ergonomic.

5) Performance:  225 hp VTEC motor is great.  Brakes are soft and professional testers have found them to be inferior to most other cars in this class.  Worse yet, the anti-lock system isn't well designed.  Handling is good (Acura sent me a video tape where the TL keeps up with a 528i in the slalom.  Don't count in it in real life, though.)  I felt a lot of body roll going over the mountains, and the steering had no road feel.  In a word, this car feels &quot;isolated.&quot;  From a luxury standpoint, that's great.  But if you want a luxury car that feels like a sports car, proceed to the nearest BMW dealer.  The Lexus GS300 has a good feel, too, but costs at least $10k more than the TL.

Bottom line:  the Acura TL is the best luxury car under $30,000.
