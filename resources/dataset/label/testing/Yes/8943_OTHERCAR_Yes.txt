            My family has this car and it has treated us well. Hardly ever to the shop and it is very roomy for a family of 5. It keeps us seperated enough to not fight but close enough for faimly bonding.

In this van 5 people can sleep comfortable while the dirver drives or if stopped 5 plus the driver can comfortable sleep. The extra room around and in back of the seat more then makes up for the smallish trunk even though i have fit 4 full sets of clubs with bags and pull carts in it.

The features in my car are great and theres lots of them go for the grand caravan over the normal its alot better of a vechile. The only feature on the grand not on the normal that i dislike is the gold rims on the wheels whihc is good if you like it but bad if you dont.

The newer/current model also arent as block sahped as the old which makes them more stylish! Also go for the leather seats the are great!
