            I know that the Grand Prix of today can never recapture the glory and styling of the 60's models but the 2000 comes as close as you will find. I have not found anything that I truly hate on this car. The instrument cluster is at once readable and smartly arranged. The fuel economy package keeps me watching closely to maintain the best possible economy in this day and age. I really appreciate the ability to access the trunk compartment from within the passenger area. I was able to receive a moonroof free of charge and find that not only does it add a mark of distinction to the vehicle it only increases the driving experience. From the roof to the tires I am in love with this car and I would highly recommend it to anyone under the age of 55. The Grand Prix has come of age again.
