            Hey everyone! WRC's here to talk about the Olympus D-360L Camera. My father brought home this camera from work, and I started to play around with it. However, it worked so well I have to write an epinion about it!

Here are the facts:
1. The camera is light, and well constructed. 
2. There is both a viewfinder window and a nice 1.5&quot; digital screen.
3. There are three different picture modes. 
    Super Quality- 36 shots on a 16 meg card
    High Quality- 73 shots
    Standard Quality- 244 shots (!) (only 600x800, I think)

Anyhoo... here is my $0.02. The camera is easy to use. I had gotten a handle on most of the basic controls in under half an hour. Control-wise, the camera isn't very difficult to use. My only complain is that there are only 2 buttons, a + and -, to control menus on the LCD screen. This is not a big deal, however. Also, the LCD screen does not have to be turned on when taking photos. This is a nice battery saving feature.

Speaking of power... there is a group of outlets in a panel on the side of the camera. One is for an AC adapter, one is for video out to a television, and I believe the last one is for a computer connection. This is another very nice feature of the D-360L. There are detailed instructions on how to attach the camera to a computer and or television.

The picture quality is excellent for a 1.3 mpxl camera. The picture quality at the Normal (High Quality) mode is excellent, measuring approximatly 1200 x 1000 pixels (give or take 100 pixels...) There is also an option to take shots as uncompressed TIFF files, which are approximatly 2mb each. However, an average user will spend most of his time in the High Quality mode. If you buy this, make sure you get at least a 16mb card for it. Having 72 high-quality shots to play with is very, very nice.

The batteries work fairly well. The indicator on the little (not picture) LCD screen gives a good indication of how they are doing.

Another thing is that the unit includes a disk drive adapter. You install a smnall program, reomve your memory card from the camera and insert it into the diskette adaptor, slip that into your 3.5&quot; disk drive and viola'! You can now drag and drop pictures from the card to the hard disk. The transfer isn't instantaneous, so go get a snack and in a minute or two the files will all be transferred.

Overall, the Olympus D-360L is an excellent camera. I would reccomend it to people who are starting to dabble with digital photography, and want great quality shots for only $300. (Besides, unless you plan on doing major photography, I would never reccomend spending more then this for a camera! ;-)
