            Before I finally bought my SUV (not the CRV) I looked at the CRV for a long time and it was toward the top of my list. Its a little small but that's Honda for you.  It has all-time 4 wheel dirve which is a plus if you live up north but uneeded if you like in the south like myself.

All-time 4 wheel drive is expensive on fuel and will wear out your tires and transmission much faster than conventional drive trains.

Also the CRV is a little small and in my opinion just barely an SUV more of a really high station wagon.  also the price is a little much the top of the line one I was looking at was 21,900 way over priced but you will pay for the Honda name.

I really do think this a good vehicle but maybe not a bargin for what its got and if you will even need what it has.<br><br>
