            This is the suv for the average guy to the high roller. It has everything you are looking for in a SUV, great gas mileage (24/29 mpg city/highway), excellent acceleration, and the look of the vehicle is just amazing. It has plenty of cargo room and if more is needed the back seats either can be folded down or taken out altogether. The ride is extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room. It has plenty of passing power even with a 4 cylinder motor. Decked out with all the options this is a very classy ride with the comfort to match and very easy on the pocketbook.
