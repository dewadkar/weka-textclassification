            I drove 4 other cars before opting for the Accord:  V6 Passat, Infiniti G35, V6 Camry, Nissan 350Z.  In all cases the Accord was a better value (it could be argued that the 350Z does not really fit into this category).

EXTERIOR/INTERIOR/COLOR/STYLING/COMFORT:
I really liked the shade of red offered, but not the tan leather/woodgrain accents that came standard with it.  I opted for the silver exterior, which comes with black leather/chrome accents.  This interior has a luxury feel to it that was missing in the other vehicles in its class.  I liked the cupholders and the CD Changer/holder.  Instrument placement is very good.  Since I am a shorter lady (5'5), I like that the top of the floor console slides forward to provide an armrest if needed.  It is very roomy for me and my taller male friends also say it suits them.  The backseat is small, but I don't have much use for it.  The seats themselves, with lumbar support, have the firm feel that is more common to European cars.  I prefer this over the softer seats that NAFTA buyers usually like.  If you're not accustomed to a coupe, then visibility out the side/rear windows can seem bad.  I've adjusted to this now.  There was a little rattle where the left front of the windshield meets the hood, but the dealer adjusted it with no problem.

The exterior styling is good, with curves in all the right places.  Although the styling is not 100% original - not much is these days.  I especially like the side profile and also the taillamps.  The only drawback is the wheels/rims.  The vehicle does not look right with the standard ones.  It really needs a "tougher" look that bigger rims provide.

HANDLING/PERFORMANCE
240Horsepower.  That pretty much says it all.  No other car in its class was close (350Z had 287, but again, not exactly the same breed of horse).  The acceleration is amazing, even at higher speeds.  It is very responsive.  It could do a little better around the corners (feels a little soft at higher speeds), but suspension not withstanding - it's a great value for the price.  I read where this engine was in the top ten for the year, and I'm not surprised.  I also like that the ride is smooth and the engine is quiet.  I expected it to be much louder with 240hp.  

The price below included mud guards and a sunroof wind deflector to reduce wind noise.  I bought my rims separately aftermarket so the price below is for standard wheels.
