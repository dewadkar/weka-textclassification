            i bought this vehicle because it was a present from my fahter
after high school it is a very smooth car if you know what i mean
you`ll notice the difference if you tried it after a jeep
but the car has some defaults:
1-the stereo system sucks:
                      -it`s very big(you can`t change it cause the space                          is too big for any ordinary system))
                      -it has no special features ((music searche,...))
                      -it only has 2 speakers at the front
                      -the volume key gets busted after the first year
2-the suspention sys:
                    -at first i loved it but after 50000 the car started
                    to make sounds and wasn`t that tough on the road                      anymore((but that`s maybe cause the roads in egypt                       aren`t that good))
but over all i loved the car it was beautiful<br><br>
