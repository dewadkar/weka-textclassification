            Recently on a trip to the Smokey Mountains on business, I was allowed to have use of our companies prestige car -- a BMW 750 iL.  This was a wonderful surprise.  I drove a car, which some only dream about, 1400 miles covering both city, highway and rural driving.

First, the gas mileage was reasonable, about par for a Suburban with a V8, but excellent for a V12.  One of the best engines I have ever experienced, save for the wonderful music of a 60s Jag straight 6.  The 750 pulls strongly all the way through each gear in the 5 speed automatic.  Each shift is marked only by a slight change in engine noise, hardly any stutter as compared to other automatics.  But this is hardly noticeable as the engine is virtually silent.

Once up to speed, the fun only begins.  The interior is covered in some of the best leather.  The driver's seat is supportive, yet not overly firm.  I had no passengers to check other seating positions.  One needs a calculator to find the possible number of seating positions.  The massage feature is one of the best parts of the seats.  It keeps you refreshed even after 8 hours of driving.  Even the back seats had power adjustments, allow I did not have the chance to check them out.

The other features of the car fit in perfectly with the intended market segment.  The power operated rear sun screen helped reduce some glare, although it was probably geared more towards rear passenger comfort.  While the ventilation system that pumps hot air out of the vehicle was extremely appreciated in the hot Tennessee sun, not to mention the wonderful air conditioning.  One can not describe the sound that pours from the stereo, the best one can come is saying it is phenomenal.

With all the performance and features the car offers, it is no surprise that it commands a premium over other automobiles.  But the price is justified.  After my driving experience I decided I might look into getting one, a lesser 740, but price kept it just out of my reach.  As a feature/dollar ratio, it fares excellent, compared to other high priced vehicles.  BMW even offers, at a fairly high cost, light armor for the 7-series.  But at roughly $124,000, I would for go the armor and save $20-30,000 on the price of a 750 iL.  BMW has a real winner in comfort and performance.  The price also gives the lucky few who purchase these vehicles as daily drivers a degree of exclusivity not offered with other luxury autos.<br><br>
