            This car is definitely worth the buy. It's sporty, fun and has a slick design. It hugs the curves, runs like a champ. I've owned two Probes, the first one was an 89 and it was ok, for a four cylinder, but the 95 Probe v6 is great. It's definitely not a family car, there's no head room for back seat passengers. Then again it never bothered me, I like it especially because I'm short and I'm not drowning in too much car. I like the cargo space in the trunk, also the back seats fold down for more room. I own a manual clutch Probe, the fuel efficiency is great. If you want a roomy car get a minivan, if it's a sporty fun car you want get the Probe. The Probe I bought had 34,000 miles now it has 80,000 and I still love it. The only problem with this car is the parts are expensive, with simple maintenance most serious issues can be avoided. I have had no problems with my car breaking down. Just recently I replaced the reverse light bulb and I had one axel fixed, but that was due to a pot hole about two feet in diameter, definitely not an off roader. The tune-ups are also somewhat expensive.
