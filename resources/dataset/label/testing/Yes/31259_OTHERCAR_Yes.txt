            We had a 1991 Grand Am that the head cracked so we went in to get a new car and I got a 1995 Grand Am. Here it is 2000 and I still have it. We have had no major problems with it it has been the best car we have had so far. All though now with 3 kids I need more room but other then that I love it I highly recommend any model of Grand Am or Pontiac for that my next car will be a Pontiac Mini van.
We have not had to take it in for any repairs and on road trips it is great on gas. It has 60k miles on it now and still running great I may just keep it for a second car when I get the minivan.<br><br>
