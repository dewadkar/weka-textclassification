            I recently rented a 2000 Ford Taurus SE.  I must say, &quot;Not too shabby for a rental&quot;.  The Taurus has many nice options including power seats, windows and mirrors and an anti theft system.  There is an optional CD changer, ABS, side air bags and traction control.

This year's model also has alternative fuel options for natural gas and propane, though I'm not too sure where you would get these gases for the vehicle.

The Taurus rides wonderful for a mid-sized car. It is very quiet and shifts very smooth. The interior is very roomy and the seats are very comfortable with the console hidden neatly in between the front seats so it can be used as an additional seat (with seatbelt) or you can fold it down to use the cup holders, etc.

The only downfalls I've found driving this car is that the breaks need to be very firmly pressed to stop and the defogger takes forever, I found driving in the rain that the windows constantly stay fogged.

I would recommend anyone taking this car for a test drive and seeing for themselves..It will be definately one I will consider the next time I'm in the market for a new car.<br><br>
