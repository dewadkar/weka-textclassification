            Update 9/25/00 - It now has 5800 miles and has had the first oil change/service. I enjoy driving the car more each day and the handling and roadholding is particularly impressive. The two problems have been that the drivers' seat lumbar support has fallen off and that road noise above 65 mph is not great. However, it's a great car and I continue to highly recommend it.

Original review - 
This review is somewhat different, as the Focus is the first car I have owned.  At the age of 25, I am a new driver because when we moved from Chicago to Evanston I needed a car mainly for my journey to work, but also to make the rest of life more convenient. We wanted a small car and I was interested in something that had some style. 

We researched a lot and decided to focus on the VW Jetta and the Focus, though I would now include also the new Nissan Sentra and the Mazda Protege. We test-drove both cars and the Jetta with both the base 2-liter engine and the V6. We ended up choosing the Focus because it provides better value than the Jetta. Taking the latter with the V6 produces a great car at well over $20,000 whereas the Focus ZTS at the top of the line costs $16,000.

Since buying the Focus we have put 2700 miles on it and I am very impressed so far. I have the same concerns about the quality of American cars that are pervasive but so far the Focus has not shown any problems. Fit and finish are very good and all I have noticed are a couple of rattles, both of which have disappeared.

The car is equipped with as many features as exist on small cars including electric windows and mirrors, cruise control, an in-dash CD player, ABS and the all-important faux-wood (too make sure that there is a tacky item present). We added only automatic transmission and side-impact airbags to the standard equipment list for an invoice total of $17,300 including delivery and a price paid of $16,000 (about $250 above invoice) through Priceline which I highly recommend. 

The car is gold with a beige interior and the design is Ford?s New Edge. Some people dislike it, but I find the bug-shaped headlights attractive and different and I enjoy the design inside. The central console is well designed with the stereo above the climate controls for example which allows radio changes to be made more easily. There are a couple of annoying design issues. One is that the central console is curved in such a way that the passenger-side drink-holder cannot hold a tall drink. A second is that the change holder is high up right next to the dashboard and you cannot see what is in it.

However, the car has some thoughtful features. A couple of examples are the fact that the light comes on when the car is remotely unlocked, the audio system can be used for an hour without the key being in the ignition, and the windscreen wipers have 6 different intermittent settings to use as well as normal and high-speed. Together, these features suggest a car that has had a lot of thought put into its design.

And driving it has been a pleasure too. My source of frustration has been that the Zetec engine (130hp and the better of the two offered) is underpowered in the low-rev range.  As a result performance when the car is at 1800 rpm is acceptable, but to get strong performance you need to get the engine above 3000 and the automatic transmission downshifts unwillingly to do this. The engine is smooth and reasonably quiet but there is no question that this is a 4-cylinder, not a 6. The handling and ride of the car are excellent. The ride is slightly firm but that is part of a car that feels well controlled. The handling is very sure-footed and it hold the road very well. Gas mileage has been around 24-25 mpg so far but it has been climbing in the last couple of weeks. Brake performance is also excellent.

In summary, I would highly recommend this car. It has been well designed and drives very well. There are a couple of things that could be better but its value for money is very good. It is continuing into the 2001 model year with very few changes though a traction control system will be available on the car. Now, all I hope is that Ford dealers do as well as the car.
