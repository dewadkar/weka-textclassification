            For the last three years, we had been a one-car family.  And considering that one car is a 1969 VW, long road trips were not in our vocabulary.  With a new job and a 50-mile commute, it was time to get a new car.

<b>Going Shopping</b>
We looked at a lot of different vehicles, both cars and SUVs.  We decided to go with a small to medium-sized SUV because we wanted space for ourselves (two 6-footers) and to tote our two dogs.  We also wanted AWD and ABS for the rain and snow we get in our part of the country.  I wanted a little luxury of seat warmers since this was my first new car.  And, the price needed to be reasonable (under $27,500).  Our short list included:
-	Saturn VUE (roomy, nice drive)
-	Pontiac Aztek (roomy, nice drive, odd looking)
-	Honda CRV (backseat was small, didn&#146t like the gear shift being on the dashboard)
-	Jeep Liberty (too small, backseat was uncomfortable)
-	Toyota Rav4 (too small for us to fit comfortably)
-	Toyota Highlander (very roomy on the inside, best backseat of all, too difficult to locate one which lends itself to dealer markups)

My spouse&#146s parents both work for GM, so they were very interested in us going with a GM vehicle.  After test driving several makes and models, we had settled on the Saturn VUE.  It was a good size for two 6-footers, it was a pleasure to drive, and it was designed well.  We went in to purchase the VUE using our GM discount and the dealership refused to accept the discount.  We went home disappointed and shell-shocked.  The next weekend we headed back to the Saturn dealership to see if we could strike a bargain.  Suddenly, the dealership decided that they would honor the discount on stock (as opposed to special orders).  We asked them to try and find a Black VUE and we would want leather and seat warmers after-market.  The sales staff was very friendly when we were on site, but they wouldn&#146t return our calls.  It was almost like they didn&#146t care if we bought a VUE or not, so we decided to look seriously at our alternatives.

We looked at the Pontiac Aztek, our second choice.  It was very roomy both in the front and back seats.  The luxury package included leather, seat warmers, and some other nice extras like On*Star.  The Aztek is not as popular a vehicle as the VUE or Highlander.  It has gotten mixed reviews on Edmunds.  We went ahead and test drove both a 2001 and a 2002 to identify the differences.  Ironically the 2002 model appears to have a lower MSRP than the 2001 while having more options, so we focused on the 2002 model.  We asked the dealer to find a black Aztek with the luxury package and we were able to get delivery within 10 days.  (We lost the On*Star part of the package because it had a sun roof.  Make sure you understand which features &#147trade out&#148 when you add other options.)

<b>The Decision</b>
When we lined up the features of the VUE and the Aztek, the Aztek had more bells and whistles standard from the factory (i.e., leather and seat warmers).  When we compared price, VUE cost more than the Aztek.  We had to ask ourselves if we were getting more value out of the VUE than the Aztek, and the answer was no.  

<b>Incentives and Negotiation</b>
We bought it during 2002 Manufacturer&#146s Cash Back Program, we got an additional $2002 off the Aztek.  (Good for all deliveries through February 28, 2002).  For those interested in the 2001 model, there is additional cash back of $1000 on top of the $2002.  I recommend checking out www.edmunds.com for details on all Incentive Programs.  I also recommend www.carbuyingtips.com for some advice on purchasing a car and negotiating with the dealer.  We are currently shopping for an extended warranty since Pontiac only provides a 3 year/36,000 mile standard and with the amount I&#146m driving, that won&#146t last long.

<b>Our New Rig</b>
We&#146ve had the Aztek for two weeks and love it.  It is a big change from the VW, and I'm still adjusting to the size difference and learning to parallel park.  I can turn quickly without fear of rolling, it has been stable in the wind, and I have not experienced any of the "mushy break" issues mentioned in other reviews.  I love the dual passenger/driver climate control and the vents for the backseat so that everyone gets fresh air.  The engine is so quiet...I keep thinking I've stalled.

The Aztek doesn&#146t have a pretty face&#133but it is growing on me.

<b>Three Months Later</b>
We've had the Aztek for three months and have put about 9000 miles on it, mostly highway driving.  There are three issues of which you should be aware:
1.  There is a little water condensation inside the front, left turn signal.  Solution: Took to dealer.  Dealer replaced seal.  Covered by warranty.  No further problems.
2.  Cosmetic Issue: The piece of ribbed material that surrounds the gearshift as it goes into the console and moves with the gearshift as you change gears has come loose and is not tracking.  Solution: Took to dealer.  Dealer replaced material.  Covered by warranty.  No further problems.
3.  The lower part of the back windshield (beneath the spoiler) is prone to getting dusty, but traditional no-touch car washes don't really get it clean.  Solution: Rewash that section by hand or use a wetnap.
4.  The rear hatch does not fully unlatch the first time you press the button (either on the front console or the remote).  It is a known problem as seen on the Yahoo boards.  Solution:  Take it to dealer to be fixed.    

I am still happy with the Aztek and find the storage both up front, in the doors, and in the back really great.  I regularly use the back bins for groceries and no longer lose fruit to sharp turns.

<b>A Year Later</b>
We've had the Aztek for over a year and have put about 34000 miles on it.  We are getting just under 21.5 miles to the gallon over all of those miles...not bad for a SUV.  I've had two flat tires due to road hazards (nails seem to be everywhere in this town!)  The first time I took it to the dealer in Salem, OR to be fixed and they did so for no charge.  The second time, the dealer wasn't open so I took it to a local tire store: Les Schwab.  Unfortunately, we kept hearing this odd grinding/electronic noise from that wheelwell, so we took it to our local dealer.  They fixed it, but gave us the old "I hope you didn't get this fixed at Les Schwab. That invalidates the warranty."  In the end they fixed it for free (something to do with the AWD not engaging).  We'd definitely buy an Aztek again...maybe a white one.
