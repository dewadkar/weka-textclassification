            Picture this: You're sitting at the car repair shop, waiting for the mechanic to get around to looking at your vehicle, after two hours, he comes in, with that &quot;I'm eating steak tonight&quot; grin and tells you how much it's going to be. 

Oh yeah, we all love this, we can't think of a better way to spend a day...but I can say with my Subaru, this scenario has not happened in 5 years and 75,000 miles!!!

We bought a 1995 Subaru Impreza L wagon new five years ago and it still looks as good as the day we bought it. Here's the list of what we replaced so far in these 5 years:

Front brake pads (at 60,000 miles)
Serpentine belt (at 75,000)
8 valve stems
tires
hubcaps
1 battery 
1 air filter

This list does not include what we consider &quot;routine&quot; maintenance, such as oil changes, wiper blades, etc. 

Now, we haven't babied this car either. We chose to have only 1 car, so this vehicle is running from morning to night, and on weekends it gets loaded to the gills with camping equipment and other gear for our hobby a medieval recreationist. The places we go to do Medieval re-enactments are not necessarily in easy access locations, and the all wheel drive has come in very handy many times.

Upstate NY winters are a breeze with this car. We got buried in a blizzard in Buffalo once, and once they reopened the roads we were on our way with no trouble, but we couldn't say the same for our friends without all-wheel drive.  

Our coworkers who drive American cars tell us horror stories of water pumps, exhaust manifolds,transmissions, and so on, and we just smile and offer to pick them up at the repair shop. 
 
Ok, there are some drawbacks. First, this car is a little small for someone who is a size 2x or larger(my husband. He tends to get uncomfortable on long trips. The ride is not as smooth as a luxury car, but then we're talking reliability. 

Cargo size for just the two of us is a little cramped (but we really don't know how to pack light.) Occasionally, we've had to do without something at our re-enactments because it won't fit. I don't think Subaru had 65 pounds of Medieval armor, and two spinning wheels in mind when the interior was designed. 

However, for the student off to college, or just graduating college and needs to pay back his student loans. This car is definitely cheaper over the long run.  

Would we buy another one? You bet! I've got my eye on a Forester, but we can't decide whether to finally become a two-car family, or trade in such a reliable friend.<br><br>
