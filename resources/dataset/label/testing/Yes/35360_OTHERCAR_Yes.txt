            I bought this car to replace a 1983 Mercedes 300D.  Leg room, features and performance all made this car a step up from the Mercedes.  In addition, the car has had no major failures (a cup holder broke last year) and still drives nicely at 5 years.
Major pluses:
Leg Room:  Grown-ups can be comfortable in back, and BIG grownups will be comfy in front.  Only larger Cadillac and Lincoln models compare in the same performance range.
Features:  The standard luxury features like power seats, cup holders, change holders, and CD changer are laid out a little more intelligently.  Dual air controls mean my wife and I can be comfortable even though she likes to be colder.  The features tend to be higher quality, although the cup holder DID break after 4 years.  My Mercedes never had a cupholder break, but the power seats failed twice and the air failed annually.
Performance:  Of course, going from a diesel to Volvo's 200+ HP was wonderful, but I continually marvel at the sluggishness of every other car I've driven since getting the 850 (including 4 different Mustangs).
Overall, a problem-free car with side-impact air bags and super performance.  If you can find one coming off lease, I recommend it!<br><br>
