                 This was the first new car I had ever owned.  Prior to the Audi A4, I had a 1994 Toyota Camry, 4 cylinder.  Needless to say, I was not accustomed to major horsepower and I wasn't really looking for major horses under the hood.  Thank god I didn't really expect this because I would have been disappointed in the A4.  Personally, I do not mind the fact that it is a 4 cylinder in the 1.8 model.  It is a quick 4 cylinder but you have to keep in mind that it IS a 4 cylinder and not a v6.  When you are in tiptronic mode (fake stick shift), you notice a bit more power and "umph" in the engine.  This is great on inclines on road trips.
     
     After reading a few reviews, some people complained on the red interior.  Personally, I like it.  It's a unique feature and a great conversation starter.  I can see how people would consider it to be "complicated" but if you are under 40 years old and have some semblance of technology awareness, you should not find it to be a problem (i.e. If you can set the clock on your microwave, you are good to go).
     
     I had gotten the bose 9-speaker stereo option upon purchasing the Audi and I really do like it.  You get nice bass without being too "boomy" and rattling any of the interior. FYI- I am not a fan of CD magazines but you do have this option.  It would be located in the trunk.
     
     On the other side of the token are the negatives about the interior and electronics.  Approximately 5 months after owning the vehicle, I noticed the radio was having a quirky problem that didn't occur too frequently.  If I were to turn off the car and the radio was set at 97.9, I would turn it back on and it be set at 98.1.  Very odd.  It started to happen a bit more frequently and got a bit annoying.  After taking it in to the shop, they told me that they would have to replace the radio.  A little birdie this problem was all too common with the audis so I asked the service rep about it.  He said, and I quote, "It doesn't happen all too often but we do see it."  So I asked, "Not too often?  Like maybe 4 or 5 cars every month?"  He replied, "Well, like 4 or 5 cars each week.  But keep in mind we see 75 cars per week."  If you do the math on this, that is approximately 20% of the cars they see.  So, he ordered me a new radio and told me it would be FOUR TO SIX MONTHS to have it arrive because it was on backorder.  It has been about 4 months now and no word.  Below is a list of reasons I have taken my car in to the dealer and the waiting time I have experienced.

1) regular maintenance check.  3 hour wait.
2) regular maintenance check.  2 1/2 hour wait. Booked 2 weeks in advance.
3) Quirky radio.  1 1/2 hour wait.  Ordered replacement radio.  Still waiting for it 4 months later.
4) Regular Maintenance check: 3 1/2 hour wait.
5) Check engine light was "stuck on".  4 1/2 hour wait.  Cause: cracked valve
6) Check engine light was "stuck on" again after 3 days.  1 hour wait, given a "loaner" vehicle (Acura Integra) for 2 days.  Cause: Broken emissions seal and broken cruise control.

Note: I have owned this car since March 2000.  At the time of this posting, it is May 2001.  
     
      One of the benefits is their warranty.  It literally coveres everything but the tires and they offer you a roadside assistance number through AAA for the duration of your warranty.  I have only used it once for a blown tire and not for anything audi-related.  I have not paid any money for any of the above dealer experiences.  Audi always makes it a point to contact their consumers after any maintenance experience to make sure you had a decent experience with them.  They really do listen to you and your comments are taken seriously.  For someone who may value good customer service, this is a definite bonus.

     When I purchased this car, one of the major reasons I got it was because it was not like hondas or toyotas where every other car on the road was one of those two.  It was unique and definitely made heads turn.  Unfortunately, it has become a more common car on the road.

     One of the more minor benefits of owning this car is that I got the Xenon headlamp option with fog lamps.  I gotta say that I was always annoyed by these lamps from other drivers but now that I have them, I really like them.  They light up the road with a cleaner light than they traditional headlamps and give a wide and long illumination on the road.  This is only intensified by the use of the fog lamps in addition.

     One last issue that I will address is one that was covered in other reviews.  There is a huge blind spot but it is nothing more than I have seen in convertibles or chryslers for that matter.  It's just something you have to get used to.

     If anyone has any questions about this car, feel free to email me and hopefully I can give you some more first-hand experience from owning this.  Unfortunately, I may not own this car much longer (The parents are overly frustrated with my overall audi experience) and I may take my mom's current vehicle while she trades mine in for a new car for herself.  I really do enjoy the car, all negative experiences aside.
