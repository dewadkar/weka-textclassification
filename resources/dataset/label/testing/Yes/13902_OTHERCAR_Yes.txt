            I knew what I was getting into when I traded my '93 SL1 for a 2001 SL2.  I feel that Saturns are the one of the best made cars manufuctured today.  

To begin with, my SL1 has never had a problem.  I bought it used from its first owner and it had about 70,000 miles.  In the next three years, through 100,000 miles, the only time it saw a repair shop was for a water pump and a drivers side door that didn't open.  The car was incredibly reliable and smooth driving!  My wife decided that since it had 100,000 miles on it, that a new car would be a good idea.  She's not very comfortable with the idea of having cars with high mileage -- with a baby and another on the way, who can afford a surprise transmission repair?  I loved my SL1, the only thing that I did not like was the noise produced by the interior - vibrations, etc which could get annoying.

We went to Saturn of Grand Rapids and spoke with Fred Kroft one Tuesday evening.  I expressed my interest in a new SL1.  I test-drove a 2001 SL1 and was less than enthusiastic -- for one, it was an automatic transmission.  I HATE automatic transmissions.  Secondly, it didn't have the boost that my car did -- probably because mine was a manual transmission.  When we returned to the dealership I said that I was looking for something with a little more oomph to it.  He suggested the L series, but quite frankly that was out of our price range.  Then he suggested an SL2 that he had on the lot.  It was silver -- the color that I wanted -- and a stick!  We took it out for a test drive and I fell in love with it.  It was much more powerful than the SL1, mainly due to the increased horsepower and manual transmission.  I loved the way that it handled, too --  so smooth and it felt like I was driving a race car.  After that test drive, no one could tell me that I couldn't have this car.  The only option that I wanted that was not already installed was the spoiler -- call me vain but this was my one "luxury" item.  My old SL1 had a power sunroof which I liked but wasn't prepared to pay the price for with this car.  I decided that the sunroof could wait until further down the road if I decided to have one installed by Saturn.  I did not purchase the anti-lock brakes.  The SL2 was virtually identical to the SL1 except for it had 15" wheels instead of 14" wheels, upgraded seat coverings, lumbar and height adjustment on the driver's seat and more horsepower under the hood.

When I brought in my car the next week to have the spoiler installed, everyone was still very nice (even after I bought the car -- Ford dealerships take notice!) and they even got pizza for those who were in the waiting room.  That was impressive.  My salesman, Fred, even came over and talked with me and asked me how my daughter was doing.  He remembered her name, even.  That was impressive, too.

Now why do I love my Saturn?  Let's start with the looks.  It's a silver model, which never looks dirty.  I have a five-speed on the floor which is probably the smoothest transmission I have ever had the pleasure of driving.  There is enough power under the hood to satisfy my cravings for speed and noise lust, but not enough to cut the excellent gas mileage that I get from the car.  The air conditioning doesn't noticeably cut on the power like it did in the SL1 (I would always refer to it as "turbo mode" when I turned off the air while driving the SL1).  One of my favorite features -- the cupholders!!!!  My SL1 did not have any cupholders at all.  This car has two large cupholders in the center console, plus one built in each map pocket in the front doors.  There is also a great storage place in the console that I didn't have in my old car.  The back seaters have two cupholders at their disposal (not that we ever have anyone riding in the backseat that drinks from a real cup... yet) and there are anchors for the car seats that have the extra belt to hook on to in the rear window sill.  The back seat folds down to increase trunk space, but -- get this -- they lock so no one can get into your car via the trunk or vice versa.  Plus the trunk has a release button so if, God forbid, anyone ever gets locked in the trunk they can free themselves.  The people at Saturn have thought of everything!  Another nice feature is the oil change reminder.  This is a button in the fuse box that gets pressed at every oil change.  A "change oil" light goes on when the 3.000 miles are up, reminding you to change your oil and at the same time you don't have to have an ugly sticker from the oil change place reminding you of your next oil change.  I hate that.

Speaking of oil changes, Saturn offered (and I bought) a Car Care plan that includes oil changes!  That's right for only $15 a month tune-ups, oil changes etc are all covered when you bring in the car!

The sound system is awesome.  Being a huge music lover, I loved the fact that it has a great-sounding audio system plus a built in CD player (I didn't have to install an aftermarket deck this time) that doesn't skip at all.

I also have the keyless entry and Saturn Security System which are a huge convenience.  With kids and all the stuff you have to haul for them, the last thing you want to do is set everything down and get your keys to unlock the door.  With the remote, I just unlock my doors from inside and they are ready to go when I get there.  Plus I can open my trunk remotely so I just throw all the bags in the trunk without putting them down and fishing out my keys.

Another option that I love is the price.  We chose to lease our car, but the buyback value at the end of 39 months was really surprising... I love the idea that I can still buy an excellent 3-year-old car with less than 39,000 miles, know its history like the back of my hand, and still pay so little for it.  

The only drawback about this car is that it has slight interior noise -- not as bad as my old Saturn but some rattling in the plastic panel along the doors by the drivers head.  Not bad enough to bring it back, though.

Everyone at Saturn of Grand Rapids was extremely friendly and helpful.  I am so happy with our experience there and with the car itself.  I highly recommend them and the car to anyone considering a Saturn.  You won't regret it!
