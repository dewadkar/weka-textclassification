                   This car I bought used with just about 40,000 miles. I have had about a year and a half and has 64,000 on it. The only problem I have had is putting in new brakes. The car has been very reliable otherwise. This car is the base model with a 5sp manual transmission and the only extra it has is the A/C (which works very well). 
The car is a little cramped inside with the low headroom. The back seat actually is roomier. All the controls are well laid out and the 5sp manual shifts nice. The shifter is a little clunky but is in a nice position and is easy to shift. The seats are basic. They are not that comfortable after a few hours, so you need to get out and stretch now and again. I have a child car seat in the
	On the road it is quite capable. It rides fairly nice for an economy car and handles well at speeds. The model I have does not have power steering so driving it slow is a chore as in parking or turning from a stop. The turning radius is its major downfall. Parking can be a chore, but power steering would help greatly to make it easier to park as you will be doing alot of adjustments to park it. 
        Mind you this is no speed demon but it does quite well passing and getting on the highways. I enjoy driving this car. The visibility is good but you sit low on the road. I only notice this when a SUV is next to me and all I can see is tire. The dent resistant panels work well, as my wife will contest to but that is another story. It gets about 33 MPG on the highway and slightly lower with A/C around 31MPG. 
       Overall I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a basic car. The only thing I can say is buying one with power steering. This will help with the poor turning radius in tight spots.
