            This car is an aboslute engineering mastrpiece. Some people have to realize that this is not a drag racing car. It doesn't have 100's of hosrepower to give. However, this car is very fun to drive and the cornering is absolutely stunning, the car hardly leans at all. The engine is very powerful for a 4-cylinder. It's also a great gas saver unlike the Camaro with 8-cylinders. I had to keep filling that thing up all the time!! The interior was well thought out and the bucket seats are comfortable. I also like the fact that, if you wanted to, you could drive the car all year round(I wouldn't do that because this is a rare car, but if you wanted to you could). The acceleration is great for a NON-TURBO normally aspired engine! Very good. Instead of making the engine IGGER Acura used it's innovative skills to improve on a 4-cylinder that was already great! this little Vtec is very powerful. Also I think that Acura/Honda knew what they were doing when they made this car. This car can EASILY be race modified. ALL the aftermarket products to increase performance for this car is astounding and easy to find! Knowing Acura which is actually Honda, I know that this car will last for years upon years.
