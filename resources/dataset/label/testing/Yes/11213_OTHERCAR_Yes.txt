            When we set out for a new minivan, we didn't know what to look for. With all the possibilities there are out there, we didn't know how to choose. One sliding door or two? Leather or not? What brand should we choose? Then we test drove the Chrysler Town and Country. Its the smoothest ride on the planet. I sometimes have to listen really hard to be able to recall whether the car is already running or I have to start it.

It all starts with the seats. They are probably the best thing about the car. The front two captain seats are heated, and on a cold winter day that is a wonderful amenity to have. The four captain seats themselves are <b>HEAVENLY</b> to sit in. Its that perfect feel of leather along with the very well designed seats combine for the ultimate feel. Plus, when you have a car like that, like us, you obviously have a sizable family and trips can be a pain. But for me when the back bench lays out at a 180 degree angle into a bed, there's nothing better.

And you want options? Come and get 'em.
We're talking a 3.8 Liter six-cylinder to start, which is probably one of the most powerful six's I've ever had the pleasure of driving. Then we get to the Fully decked out power-everything: locks, windows (including the hands-free/automatic-down feature on the driver side window), dual seats with 10 directions of movement. And the stereo system? to die for. Chrysler has always had the good taste to license with Infinity, but this time they out-did themselves. I have difficulty counting how many speakers there are but last I checked there were ten. Ten amazingly powerful Infinity speakers amplifying the AM/FM/Cassette/CD Infinity stereo. The sound quality and output is breath-taking so much so that I would rather listen to a CD in the minivan than in my home theater. Then we get to the heating system, and even though some of it has to do with the infancy of my car, which can jump to the temperature you want so quickly you don't have time to prepare. And back to the family trips: What's something that always causes troubles? Cupholders, you stop for drink and you realize that your coffee is going to be replaced by a 3025 oz. bottle of Pepsi, like it or not. This makes two problems, you have to keep passing drinks between the people that are doing the drinking and those next to cupholders and also the fact that oversized drinks and juiceboxes never quite fit. Well they took care of that too. There are sixteen cupholders total in the car and eight can handle a juicebox and 4 can adjust in size. The middle captain seats fold down and serve as tabletops. While we are still on the issue of trips, with the ever increasing childhood desire for technology on the go, including in the car they have begun to need a DC adapter to connect into your cigarette lighter, which ironically enough is the exact lighter you so desperately need to hook your extremely important cell phone into. 

This car is amazing, its got hooks in the trunk to hang your grocery bags so things don't fall out!

Now, with a minivan comes safety issues. The most important being the dual airbags. This has 'em. Also, its got a great 4-Wheel Anti-lock Disc Braking System, which I have disassembled and can say is a fine piece of engineering. This car also has a very strong body and will react quite well in crashes. When its a matter of your family's safety: there is no question.

If you want the premiere minivan, this is it.<br><br>
