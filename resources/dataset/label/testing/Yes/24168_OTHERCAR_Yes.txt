            The 1996 Chevy Camaro Z28 is a fast nice handling car that I think will
just devour almost any car that tries to race it.  The car has some major
power that you can use to burn out in almost any gear.  This car not only
has power but also has the power to handle with tremendous excelence.
The car feels like it is low to the ground and sticking to the pavement
enabling the driver great control to do whatever they want.  The inside 
of the car with it's leather seats are confortable in the front but a 
little cramped in the back.  The stereo if you get it is a Bose system
that sounds excelent for any music.  This car seems to be well made except
for a couple of visits to the Dealer for some minor problems.  I say this
car is fast, slick, well handling car that you can just call a race car.
I recommend this car because of it's power and the way it feels while
driving.  What a great driving experience.<br><br>
