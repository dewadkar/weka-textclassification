            I bought a 1997 plymouth neon new in 1998 right after i graduated from nursing school.  I had a 1994 ford escort that i loved.  It wasnt too pretty but was tough.  I love my little black neon more than that tank of a car escort I had.  It has never given me any problems, great on gas mileage and had pretty good pick up.  The only thing I would say that I do not care for is the windows.  They are sometimes hard to roll down and they dont have a frame so they are noisier than most. The stock stereo is nice with a great sound for the price.  Over-all I am very pleased with my little neon, especially with the deal I got on it.  For a cheaper car it is truly a steal!<br><br>
