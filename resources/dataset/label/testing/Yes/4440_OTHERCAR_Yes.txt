            Drawn to a test drive by reading a newspaper review of the Acura CL, my wife and I were hooked.  It's the first time we have ever both liked the same model car.  There isn't anything it doesn't do well -- except that its turning radius should be tighter for u-turns.  We bought it for fun. We bought it for compact sportiness. We bought it as empty-nesters, just the folks that Honda was targeting.  Enough of the mini-van - it was time for some fun.  The surprise was that this car has proven more comfortable for long-distance highway driving than our minivan or four-door intermediate.   It rides better, feels roomy, offers a nice driver posture and good visibility, is quieter, is more comfortable to sit in, is equipped with a better sound system (optional Bose) and has the most refined engine I've experienced in this price range (the optional V-6).  
Some say it isn't sporty enough.  We felt adding the optional spoiler did the trick, though it is a bit pricey.
The reliability has been flawless, for a new model (ours is the '97).  
There is a slightly annoying hesitation apparently inherent to that model's automatic transmission between first and second gear that may have been cured in later models -- see whether it bothers you.   Other than that, everything including the cup holder does what we want.  This is an elegant-looking, head-turning happy car.<br><br>
