            When my car (a '91 Taurus) died on finals week, I didn't know what to do. Even though I had a future job secured, should I take the plunge and buy a &quot;new&quot; car instead of &quot;used?&quot; My basic requirements were simple: 1) the new car had to have &quot;rock solid&quot; reliability, 2) the seats had to be comfortable for at least an hour commute, and 3) the car had to have pep, even mated with an automatic transmission. I narrowed my choices down to the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Prizm. I eliminated most of the other cars in the class because the base engines didn't have enough pep for an auto transmission. Now, why I chose the Prizm over the Corolla. GM has a &quot;College Grad&quot; program, where you get $400 off your new car, in addition to 0 down financing. Being a starving college student, I liked the 0 down part, because it would take a few months at my new job before I could build the required down payment. Chevrolet was also offering a 2000 rebate at the time I purchased the car. In addition, I was swayed towards the Chevrolet because the options were packaged differently than the Corolla. I wanted a basic, &quot;stripped down&quot; model. I was able to get that more easily with a Prizm than a Corolla. After I test drove a Prizm, I was sold! The car was relatively quiet (not as quiet as my Taurus, though), and it handled road bumps well. The engine is very peppy, even with an automatic transmission. I drove it into the mountains a week ago, and it kept up with much larger/more powerful cars. If you are a person that intends to trade the car in after a few years, then the Prizm isn't for you. You should get the Corolla. Depreciation is horrible on the Prizm. Personally, I intend to keep the car until it dies. If you are a person who does a lot of freeway driving, opt for the 4-speed automatic transmission. I got the 3-speed, which is fine for me because I do mostly city driving. The differences between the 3-speed and 4-speed are apparent on the freeway. The 3-speed, even though it is not computer-controlled, shifts very smoothly and predictably.

If you ever intend to have anyone over 5'5&quot; sit in the back seat, the Prizm is not for you. The roofline slopes downward in the back, and legroom is virtually nonexistent. The front is very roomy, and I have no problems with my 5'11&quot; body. I would recommend getting the optional CD player--it is actually quite good! After a month and a half of driving (2000 miles), I don't have any squeaks or rattles yet. The car seems to have been built solidly for many years (and hopefuly hundreds of thousands of miles) to come.<br><br>
