            Recently I've the opportunity of racing a 166 MM in Spain. It was fantastic. The sound of the little 2-litre V12 is terrific, the five speed crash-box type gearbox is ultra-fast when double declutching, being the clutch only needed to press it once to disengage the gear, as when revved it almost look to suck the lower gear by itself!
The big finned drums pulled the car to one side whe pressed hard, but I don't know if is only a fault of the unit I drove. They are fade resistant and do not tend to block the tyres under hard pressure. The behaviour is typical of front engined-rear drive cars, with a very lively and accurate steering, and with a judicious use of the throttle more than a half turn of the wheel is never neccesary to put the car back in line after a slide. At speed over bumps is another thing and one thinks that the death may be very, very close! The contemporary racing drivers like Luigi Chinetti must had great balls! The semi-elliptic front and rear leaf springs has little travel and the car bounces and rattles and shakes and it is very difficult to maintain an accurate line.
It remains one of THE experiences of my racing life and until I'll try a 250 GT SWB, this is the very best driver's car I ever know.
