            The Nikon Coolpix 990 was part of the first crop of 3 Megapixel cameras released on the market.  Others in the group include the Sony DSC-S70 (See my earlier review.) and the Canon S20.  I've used the Sony S70 for several months now, and been very pleased.  Through a friend at work, I was able to get my hands on a Coolpix 990, and spent 1 week with it before I had to give it back.  One thing that you will immediately notice about the camera, is the ingenius swiveling lens design.  Similar to the older Sony DSC-F1 and DSC-F55, this allows you to shoot pictures of virtually any angle.  There is a soft rubber grip, which allows you to hold the camera very securely.  The magnesium alloy casing is also very sturdy, showing perhaps better build quality and durability compared to the Sony DSC-S70.  The Nikon uses compact flash cards, which are readily available in sizes up to 256MB.  One thing that I noticed, was that the LCD on the Coolpix is extremely sharp and bright, a vast improvement from the 950's that I saw in GoodGuys.  Another great feature is that it runs on standard AA batteries.  Very very convenient if you've ever, &quot;Forgotten your charger.&quot;

The picture quality in the 990 is excellent.  Colors come out bright and vibrant, very lifelike.  The 3x optical zoom is very clear, and even the digital zoom looks good.  I've never liked the digital zoom feature, but I'll admit that I had a hard time seeing the difference between optical and digital zooms.  Minor problems that I encountered, included loud focusing sounds, and nagging red eye.  With the Sony S-70, I haven't experienced this before, and it appears quite frequently.  These are really small points, as I can't really say anything bad about this camera, but I still prefer my Sony.  The Zeiss lens and cheaper price make the difference.  I must say however, that the Nikon is a wonderful camera, and it's a great choice for anyone.  If you're looking for a new digital camera, either the Sony or Nikon would be an excellent choice!<br><br>
