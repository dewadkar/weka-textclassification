            I held off for a very long time, going digital.  After all, I had a very nice Canon 35mm, that has done practically everything I asked, and then asked me for more.  But I really wanted to be able to capture photographs that I didn't have to scan before I saved them, and then lose a generation of quality.

I researched and checked, over and over.  I made a list of the features and capabilities I couldn't live without, and also the ones I'd really like to have.  One of things I absolutely could not live without was getting ISO 400 quality, since that's what I use in my 35mm.  I watched the digital technology develop and the cameras kept getting better and better.  

This fall I decided it was time.  I mad my list, then made that a short list.  Then I enlisted the help of several price comparison sites.  I even went to camera shops to see and touch the cameras in person.

I was all ready to make a final decision (and the Camedia C-211 wasn't on my list), when one of the office store chains put the C-211 on sale at a price I knew I could not trust.  I went back to the research and discovered that this camera had every one of the features I was looking for, and it also could print Polaroids!  I went to the store on the first day of the sale, and of course, they did not have any (no big surprise).  I did not let this get me down.  I went home and went to the website for this store, and tried again.  Of course, it was backordered, but they could let me have the memory now (but not the camera) RIGHT!

I went back to my price watching sites and investigated.  To my surprise I did find a small online vendor who carried the camera, for with $ 15 of what the office superstore did.  I called them to verify availability.  It was in stock.  I hurried back to the website and put in my order.  As luck would have it, I paid for ground shipping.  Unbelievably the camera arrived at my house the next day, under 24 hours from when I ordered it.  (Your results may vary)  This was getting too good to believe.

We tested the camera, playing with the features, displaying pictures on the TV, printing a few Polaroids, downloading into my PC.  After a week I can honestly say this was the right decision.  Although the dimensions of the case take some getting used to, and there is no manual viewfinder, you will get used to the camera fairly quickly.  You also get accustomed to the various menu features quickly enough by playing with it.

The other thing that took some getting used to is the way the LCD displays your intended shot, but I've been told that this is true of most LCD's on digital cameras.  If you're in a low-light setting, for instance in a nightclub, where the light is rather low, be prepared to estimate you shot without actually getting a good look at it.  With digital this really isn't a problem because, once you shoot the picture, you can see what you took, and the lighting comes out fine.  It's just that the preview makes it look like you won't have a good picture.

Let's see, what else is neat about this camera?  If you're a rank amateur with photography, you can let the camera make a lot of decisions for you, and just point and shoot.  If you're interested in maximum resolution, it can go to 1600 x 1200.  It can print Polaroids, although they are a little smaller than I expected.  But they're fun to hand out at a party, and they'll do for insurance inventory records.  There are color level adjustments, lighting adjustments, and the digital and optical zoom features.  It can shoot short movies, of up to about 20 seconds.  That's fun to play with.  In all of the reviews I saw online, I never saw a reference to panorama capability.  But when I read the user's manual I discovered that it can do that, too.

After you've taken your shot, you can do some editing from in the camera, such as cropping and realigning your picture. Or you can wait until you download, and then do it through the editing software that comes with the camera.

When you connect your camera to your PC for download by USB, you'll be surprised at how quickly the pictures are sent.  I was sitting at my PC watching to see it run through, and blip! it was done.  And I do not have a very fast computer.

The only drawback I can find with this camera, and I have been told that most digitals are pretty much the same in this respect, is their ability to gobble up batteries like nothing you ever saw.  Do yourself a favor.  If you buy this camera, immediately buy a battery charger and two sets of NiMH batteries.  They last twice as long as alkalines.  At the rates digital cameras use power, you can use one set while the other is charging.  Also add an AC adapter, because you need power for the camera when you attach it to the PC, too.  This is an imperative added expense when considering a digital camera.  But once you have those batteries, you will get about 1,000 charges out of them before they need replacing.

I'm not going to put my Canon up on a shelf and never use it again, but this Olympus is going to be great fun to explore the new things I can do with photography.  I think I'm going to need more webspace!
