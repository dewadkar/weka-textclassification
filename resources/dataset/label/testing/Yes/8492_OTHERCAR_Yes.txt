            The only thing that bugs me about it is the lens cover.  Sometimes I accidentally click it toward the closed position and it sends the lens back inside the case.  I am sure I'll get used to that.  One nice thing about that lens cover is that you can view your pics without needing to activate the lens and that is going to help with lens zoom life and battery life.

I am somewhat disappointed by the way the 20 second video turns out.  It is always dark, sometimes unviewably dark, when transferred to the computer unless it was taken in extremely light (sunlight) conditions.  But it is easy to take video.

The auto-focus and zoom features seem to work just as well as they are supposed to, better than some that I have tried.  The 3x optical is really a minimum, but the Fujinon lens seems to work flawlessly.

I am pleased by the quality of the pics that I am getting from the cam.  Definitely no complaints in that department.  The macro mode works well too.  We have gotten some great close-ups like rings on fingers and baby faces.

And to top it all off, my wife loves it to death!  And that makes it definitely worth while.
