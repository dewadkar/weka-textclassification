            The Chevrolet Cavalier has the potential to be a very fun all around driving experience.  Depending on your choice of styles you have a choice of two peppy power plants.  with both the two door coupe or the four door sedan you get a strong 115 horsepower front drive four cylinder.  But if you're like me you opt for one of the two Z24 sport models, either in the two door coupe or the two door convertible.  With the Z24 option you get 150 horsepower and 155 lbs/ft of torque to tear at the pavement and the sport suspension to to help grip the pavement, and still get 23 miles per gallon of gas shopping around the city and a very economical 33 miles per gallon of gas on the open highway.  Even if you're like me and opt for the sport package you can still rest easy with the average list price of $19,000 dollars.  Considering all the factors a solid buy in my opinion.<br><br>
