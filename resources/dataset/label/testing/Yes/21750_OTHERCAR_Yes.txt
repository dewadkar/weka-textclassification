            With a Chevrolet Cavalier, you get just about what you pay for.  You're not getting a Lexus, but you get a nice, serviceable car.  Everything in its design is done with economy in mind.  Still, it's fun to drive, sits low to the ground to make it a little sporty, and it has enough power to zip around.  I drive it on the highway and in heavy city traffic in Boston (known for aggressive traffic circle drivers).  I always feel in command of the road, and in my Chevy Cavalier, I can cut people off with the best of them.  
     The back seats are comfortable enough for three medium sized people, and the trunk can hold a couple of big suitcases.  It has a little net in the front of the trunk to hold groceries--a nice little touch.  I haven't had any major service problems in three-plus years, so that's a big plus.  Still, I don't get the feeling that I'll still have this car in 10 years.  Call me a pessimist, but it doesn't feel all that sturdy.  If you're looking for a moderate priced car, and you won't be disappointed without Lexus type extras, go with Cavalier.<br><br>
