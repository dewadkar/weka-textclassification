            Over the last 20 years I've operated both as a snapshot shooter and a professional photographer shooting weddings. My equipment included both medium format and 35mm. Add to that having my work processed in professional labs raised my over expectations of my finished work quite high. Two years ago I purchased my first digital camera. It had, at the time, high resolution at 640x480. I wanted something that could support web activity and as a replacement for general snapshots.

Over the next couple of months I used that camera in many different situations. I was very displeased with the quality and sold the camera. Two weeks ago I purchased the Toshiba M60. Felt that the technology had progressed enough to give it a second chance. The resolution at greater the 2.1 million sounded promising.

The first tests I used the camera for was to take pictures of my co-worker to place on our Web site. The clearity of the pictures were more then adequate. Even when you consider the transformation to JPEG and lose of quaility. The software package was only adequate in handling the pictures. To me all it really accomplished was moving the pictures into the PC. I quickly replaced it with Picture-It from MicroSoft. Also I added a SmartMedia reader for my PC.

What reward me most on my decission to by the M60 was when I took a picture of my Grand-Daughter in her car seat on day. I took the camera home. Used Picture-It to load the picture and send it un-modified to my HP 890 color printer. It defaulted to 8x10 when it printed. I used high quaility photo paper.  The picture is truely fantastic. I have it on my wall at work and people are amazed at the vivd colors and the sharpness of the print. They find it hard to believe it is a digital camera/printer output. It is better then point-n-shots prints in my opinion without any hestitation. And as good as any 35mm prints I've produced.<br><br>
