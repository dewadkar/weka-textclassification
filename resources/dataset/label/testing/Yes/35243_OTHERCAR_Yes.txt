            I'm in the Military stationed in Misawa, Japan for the past 2 years. My wife Jennifer has been with me but has recently decided to go back to finish school in St Louis. Over the course of time we spent in Misawa, we learned about the Exchange New Car Sales that is offered to the overseas military personnel and their dependents. We used this program in acquiring our car. I will write a separate article about this great service later.

We decided on the Cavalier Z24 after looking at three other vehicles that we were interested in (Ford Mustang GT, Jeep Cherokee Limited and a Dodge Stratus R/T). We shopped around looking at these cars the last time I was home on leave.

We found that every vehicle we looked at started out at a good base price but the price rose quickly when the options were added. OUT OF NOWHERE we noticed the Chevy Cavalier Z24, a sporty good-looking car, and most of the options we wanted were already included in the base price.

The standard equipment for the Z24 is:

<b>Platinum Tipped Spark Plugs
2.4L Twin Cam DOHC Engine
Level 11 Sport Suspension
P205/55R16 Performance Tires
16" Aluminum Wheels
Dual Frontal Air Bags
4 Wheel Antilock Brakes
Battery Rundown Protection
Remote Keyless Entry (includes power door locks and content
Theft deterrent security alarm
Dual Breakaway Sport Mirrors
Daytime Running Lamps
Passlock Theft Deterrent System
Rear Child Seat Top Tether Anchors
Base Coat/Clear Coat Paint
Body Side Moldings
Deck Lid Spoiler
Fog Lamps
2 Sided Galvanized Steel on All Body Panels Except Roof
Variable Intermittent Wipers
Air Conditioning
Zoned Read Window Defogger
Easy Entry Right Front Seat
Am/Fm Stereo with CD
Full Folding Rear Seat
Tilt-Wheel Steering Column
Tinted Glass
Sport Cloth Interior
Tachometer and Trip Odometer
Electronic Speed Control
Power Windows</b>

The estimated annual fuel cost is $780. It is estimated to get 18 to 26 miles per gallon in the city and 27 to 37 miles per gallon on the highway.

The only options I choose to add were an electric sunroof and to upgrade the speakers to a performance audio system.
To keep the price down I asked my wife what she wanted most that sexy sunroof (wind in the hair) or an automatic transmission (not as fun to drive):0). She chose ,<b>YES!</b>, the sexy sunroof.

We have only had the Z24 a short time, and I must return to Misawa Airbase soon :( My wife gets the new wheels while I return to my older 1990 MU (this is the Japanese equivalent of a ISUZU Amigo).

In the short time I have driven the Z24 I noticed right away the smooth and easy way the gears shifted. Also there a safety feature on the shifter, you must pull up the shifter in order to put it in reverse.

The keyless entry is awesome, you just touch the button and voila the trunk opens up. No fighting to balance the groceries and open the trunk door. When you unlock the doors the interior lights come on. There also is a panic alarm on the keypad. This is especially helpful when you can't remember where you parked the car. Just set off the alarm and zero in. :)

The Z24 came with a Factory Plus Plan:
Major Component Coverage Including A/C and High Tech Features (3 years/50,000 Miles). $50 Deductible. Coverage in the USA and Canada plus Limited Overseas Locations. Administered by International Warranty Services Group. This is nice since I will be out of the country at times and should there be any problems they will be covered, and my wife will not have to worry.

I fell in love with the Z24 as soon as I started the motor, it Purred in a low tone which appealed to me but was not overly noisy.

I'm 6'4�, which is big, and I was comfortable in the drivers seat due to the tilt steering. In the back seat I would be a little cramped, but that�s just me.

The spare tire is a donut (not the edible kind, :) and is located in the recessed well under the carpeting in the trunk.

This car would be great for a couple or a young family that�s just starting out. You would have the sporty look and performance at a decent price. A family would appreciate the safety features and standard option that come in the base Z24.
