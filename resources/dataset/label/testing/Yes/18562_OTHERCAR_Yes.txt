            Optics Casio QV-8000SX would envy not only other cameras (especially film, where such possibilities on cost are equal to the good automobile), but also telescopes. It has eight-multiple optical overfall of a focal point (32 digital). You will tell what such does not happen? Yes, but only when the affair does not concern digital engineering. In general, QV-8000SX opens the future of digital cameras.

However, it not too has impressed me on the design. QV-8000SX and QV-7000SX is extremely similar, differing only by compartment with optics. In all remaining QV-8000SX - it like the same camera. The same buttons, same display ... However first impression is deceptive. Both the controls, and function, and even the display are similar only outwardly. 2,5-inch LCD, which takes a large part of the back party of the camera, has become considerably faster.

All base functions of steel are even easier and more flexible, and the availability of the menu with infinite number of tunings, parameters and additional possibilities gives a big plus. By the only problem there is only LCD by impossibility of highlighting on direct illumination. 

QV-8000SX has small 1/2,7-inch matrix with 1 250 000 effective elements (that is used for image generation), which ensures a maximum resolution of an image 1280 x 960 pixels. The auto focal point now is realized by a TTL-method working on visibility. A manual focussing of device is very smooth and convenient. For a measurement of an exposition in the camera there are three systems: multizone, centreweight and dot.

Actually, Casio QV-8000SX such amount of useful photographic controls offers, that it can be envied with everybody. However for such parameters the impossibility of saving of uncompressed image becomes already essential defect.

QV-8000SX stores photos on a CompactFlash (in a package the card of volume 8 Mbytes) enters which is placed in the covered bay, and again in a unsuccessful place - at the bottom cameras. However possibility to use this camera as studio camera availability at it of the remote control panel. And besides, as well as other devices of firm Casio, at QV-8000SX do not have possibility of management and shooting immediately from the computer.

Admires the "firm" internal generator HTML. The perfect system of ordering of shots, accessible through the customizing menu, which automatically creates a full system of presentation, suitable for use in anyone Web-browser. 

QV-8000SX offers two methods of junction of the camera with the computer: on USB and on the serial port (last works more than in 30 times slower!). To look through images on the television receiver, the menu of the camera allows choice of the standard NTSC or PAL, ensuring, thus, universal compatibility practically worldwide.

It is impossible to tell, that the quality of shots made on QV-8000SX, have shaken me or have surprised. But it is necessary to return due unique optics of this camera, the system of which lenses rather complicated (and consequently - dark), and is required to it) the much greater illumination for point sampling of an exposition. 

Due to availability of a number of the previously "programmed" modes of shooting the camera is easy in use and can considerably simplify life of the photographer. These modes offer the actual help, ensuring fast deriving there are enough of qualitative shots. The automatic mode almost always works faultlessly.

Defect QV-8000SX is the use of a rather high degree of compression for saving shots even in the high-quality mode. In an outcome of a photo sin intrinsic to a format JPEG mistakes.

As Casio QV-7000SX has not any other indication, the LCD-screen is used and to show the user all current parameters of set-up of the camera. The board works rather tolerably, unless on it direct solar light hits and there is no possibility turn the display from bright rays.
