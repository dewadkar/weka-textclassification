            This summer, my dad drove my new (to me anyway) 1997 cherry red mustang GT into the driveway. To say the least, I was in heaven. At age 17, this is my dream car. Although I have only had it a few months and have experienced a few problems, I wouldn't want any other car.
First of all, I love the body style. It doesn't look plastic like the newer squarer models. It also has plenty of power with a V-8. Actually, a little too much power if you live in the mountains like I do with curves everywhere. In fact, this is what caused me to wreck my car. Yes, I was driving a little too fast on that curvy road, but not too fast for a sports car. Before I got my car, I used to drive my boyfriends camaro, and it handles curves like a dream. So naturally, I tried to same thing in my car and ended up fishtailing it into a ditch. Lesson learned, I now take curves slowly. 
Another problem is shifting into reverse. Sometimes, it just won't shift at all, and other times it will grind in that gear. So, when this problem arises, I have to shift it up into first, rev it, then it usually goes into reverse.
A month or two ago, I tried to leave the senior parking lot but after cranking the engine, it would die, unless I kept it revving. We had to drive my car home constantly revving the engine and pressing the gas, which was dangerous on the wet roads that day, until we could get it to the shop. 
The last problem I have with my GT is that it squeaks a lot. Sometimes it does this on left turns, other times it does it in the back (sounds like it is coming from the trunk) I usually just crank up the music cuz I have no idea where this is coming from.. But the bottom line is, although the car has problems, it also has 55,000 miles on it and still looks brand new (besides the dent from my wreck). I love this car, and the feeling I get behind the wheel is definately worth having to drag it to the shop every once in a while.
