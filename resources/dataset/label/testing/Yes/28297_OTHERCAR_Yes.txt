            <b>WHY I PURCHASED THE POWERSHOT 230:</b>
I was never really a fan of Canon cameras, especially Canon digital cameras.  It wasn&#146t until recently that a few of my friends were sending me pictures via email that were taken with a Canon Powershot camera.  I was pretty impressed with the results and decided to check out the newest Powershot; the S230.  This camera packed a lot of features, but kept the bulk to a minimum.  Producing images at 3.2 megapixels, the S230 was definitely appealing.

<b>WHAT IT COMES WITH:</b>
- Canon PowerShot S230 Digital ELPH camera
- NB-1LH Lithium-ion battery
- 16 MB CompactFlash (CF) Card
- USB cable
- A/V cable
- Wrist Strap
- CD with Canon software suite
- Users Manual

<b>POCKETABILITY:</b>
The first thing you notice about this camera is that it&#146s small.  Probably the smallest digital camera I&#146ve seen in the 3 megapixel category.  You can truly put this in your pocket and not have everyone stare at the bulge&#133 

<b>DURABILITY:</b>
I&#146ve already dropped this camera once on my hardwood floor.  Amazingly, it still works like a charm.  The S230 is encased in stainless steel with a few chrome accents and a couple of plastic parts (mainly the switches & dials).  I expect this camera to last several years without any problems, if not longer.  A buddy of mine has owned his Powershot S100 for over two years and he still loves his to death.  

<b>EASE OF USE:</b>
The S230 was as easy to use (if not easier) as my previous Sony digital cameras.  Before selling my Sony DSC-S75, I had the chance to compare the two, side-by-side.  The size alone, gave the S230 an overwhelming advantage.  The picture quality is very impressive with the S230.  The indoor photos that I took without the flash turned out great.  The auto-exposure, as well as the auto-ISO settings works fine, but if you want to manually set those on your own, it&#146s easy to do.  There are other cool features on the S230 such as picture effects (black and white, sepia, soft, sharp, etc.).  The 1.5&#148 LCD is very useful and is very clear, even in bright sunlight.

<b>ADVANCED FOCUSING:</b>
AiAF (Artificial Intelligence Auto-Focus) is a new feature found on the S230 that was not present in the earlier models of the Powershots.  This function allows the S230 to select from one of the nine focus areas within the frame to capture the sharpest shot.  It&#146s pretty amazing how this works.  This feature can also easily be turned off in the settings.  This feature is found on the new Canon G3, as well, and is the flagship of the point-and-shoot digital camera line for Canon.    

<b>PICTURE QUALITY:</b>
As I mentioned, I was quite impressed with the photo quality.  I managed to print some of them on photo paper using my HP 960c deskjet printer.  Printing them in 5X7 produced brilliant, almost photolab quality pictures.  I might add that my Sony DSC-S75 also produces some of the best photos, as well, but I expect that from a camera that boasts a Carl Zeiss Sonar lens, 3.3 megapixel resolution quality, and a price tag of more than $500.  If you own a Canon printer, you should be able to directly print off of your S230 using the supplied cable.  I just ordered the Canon i850 printer, so I&#146m anxiously waiting to try it out.

<b>VIDEO MODE:</b>
The ability to capture 30 seconds of 640X480 AVI video (20 frames per second) with sound is awesome!  My father was surprised at how clearly it captures motion video.  Although you&#146re able to capture the video with sound, you won&#146t be able to play it back with sound on the camera itself, as it is not equipped with a speaker.  The S230 is capable of capturing more than 30 seconds if you use smaller resolution.  After visiting the Canon Powershot website, I learned that if you use a high-speed CompactFlash (CF) card, you should be able to capture more than 30 seconds of 640X480 video.  Canon expects to market the high speed CF card soon.

<b>BATTERY STRENGTH:</b>
This is where I&#146d say that my Sony DSC-S75 shines.  All of Sony&#146s digital cameras display the remaining life of the battery in minutes.  The S230 goes strong until there&#146s about 5% or less power left.  I&#146ve read a few articles and reviews stating that the battery life is the weakness of this camera, but it&#146s not all that bad.  It all depends on how much you use the LCD display, the flash, and how often you turn on/off the device.  I quickly ordered an extra battery from buy.com and I&#146m perfectly happy now.

The S230 comes with a separate battery charger.  This is very convenient, as you don&#146t have to charge the battery using the camera, like most of the Sony cameras do (Sony sells the battery charger as a separate accessory).  From a fully discharged battery, the charger is able to completely charge it in about two hours.  There is an LED which displays in &#145red&#146 when it&#146s charging and &#145green&#146 when it&#146s complete.

<b>OVERALL WEAKNESSES:</b>
Some people will say that the small size can be a weakness, but I&#146d say that the size is definitely its strength.  The optical zoom capability is only 2X, so you won&#146t be able to zoom up very closely from afar.  It does offer a digital zoom, but this may result in grainy photos.  The macro mode of the S230 isn&#146t as crisp as my Sony DSC-S75, but I can live with it.  Also, the flash on the S230 isn&#146t as effective as it should be.  The flash tends to white out (too bright) close-range subjects, but is very weak for any subjects more than 6 feet away.  I&#146ll have to play around some more with the settings, I guess.  Finally, the tripod mount is not positioned in the center of the camera.  It's actually placed on the side, causing it to be off-center and hard to balance.

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
I mainly purchased this camera for its size, but it&#146s turned out to be a much better camera than I anticipated.  In terms of photo quality, it may not beat the higher-end digital cameras, but it will sure give them a run for the money.  We have to hand it Canon for developing a truly pocket-sized 3.2 megapixel digital camera.
