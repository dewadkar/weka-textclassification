            The 1997 Lexus LX450 is basically a re-badged Toyota Landcruiser (both vehicles are FZJ-80 series Toyotas).  The Lexus has very slightly different styling, better quality leather, better quality wood trim interior, a significantly better stereo, better soundproofing, 15% softer suspension and is more likely to come with factory differential lockers than its Toyota Landcruiser brother.  Other than that its the same truck and most of the parts are interchangeable. I purchased mine used with 54,000 miles on the odometer.  Oddly enough, when I started looking at either this or the Toyota, I found that the Lexus versions were selling for less used even though they sold for several thousand more than the Toyota new.  I have access to the "black book" used vehicles guides used by car dealers and they value the Lexus at slightly less than the Toyota.  I am not sure why this is the case, but it certainly made my purchase decision easy.

CONS:
Since I am a "glass is half empty" type person, I will start with the CONS of this vehicle.  The vehicle has solid axles so it rides more like a "truck" than the newer independently suspended LX470 and other modern "luxury" SUV's like the BMW, Mercedes and Infiniti.  While this is a downside on the road, the LX450 will EASILY outperform all those vehicles off-road if that is important to you.

The LX450 is missing some of the creature comforts available on most modern SUV's.  Although it was an option, most of them don't come with heated seats.  They don't have the modern navigation systems.  They don't have a compass or outside temperature reading.  In addition, it only comes with one cupholder.....very odd.  There is a slot over the radio where an additional cup holder can be added and you will need it.  The cupholder can be purchased from www.sleeoffroad.com (no affiliation, etc.).

The LX450 gets poor gas mileage.  This is relative of course to other vehicles you are considering, but I got 12mpg in town and about 14mpg on the highway and around 10mpg when towing before I modified the vehicle.  I probably drive with a bit of a "leadfoot" so most can likely expect my mileage to be "as bad as it gets".

The LX450's motor is a little underpowered by current standards.  212hp and 275 ft/lbs or torque is what you get from this 4.5 liter straight six.  It's not bad, but certainly less than most of its modern competition.

PROS:
This thing is built like a tank.  It will require more standard maintenance than most, but if it is well taken care of, Toyota/Lexus designed the vehicle to go for 300,000 miles before needing major work/overhauls.  You'll feel like this is the most dependable thing you've driven.

If you actually take your SUV off road, you will not be disappointed with the LX450.  It is more capable than probably 90% of other SUV's in its class.  If it comes with factory lockers, that probably goes to 98%.

There is a nice aftermarket for this vehicle if you like to tinker.  I tow a lot and I have actually installed a Toyota Racing Development (TRD) supercharger on this vehicle.  It takes the horsepower up to about 300hp and the torque to about 400 ft/lbs.  They are available to be purchased from your friendly dealership and if they install the unit, it does not change the warranty on the vehicle at all.

Quality, quality, quality.  These are built to last, the Landcuriser slogan is "Landcruiser: Because Off-Road There is NO Roadside Assistance".  Corny but true, it applies to the LX450 as well.

SUMMARY
I've owned 20 different vehicles and this is the only one that I would consider "driving it until it dies".  Having had a chance to work on it some....they just don't build many as solid.  I think it has a lot of character in its design and has a look that will age well.  If you are the right kind of buyer, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the LX450.
