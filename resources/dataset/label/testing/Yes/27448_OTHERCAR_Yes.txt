Overall I am fairly satisfied with this car.  I now have over 80,000 miles on it but have experienced unexpected maintenance problems with it over the past two years.  I replaced the A/C Compressor (with brushes, etc.) last year (at about 60,000 miles) and I most recently have had a significant engine oil leak from a blown sensor seal (about 75,000 miles).  Other than that the car has been reliable.  It is spacious and comfortable in comparison with numerous cars of the class in which I have ridden.  I have consistently averaged 30 mpg over the life of the car (predominantly mixed driving) with up to 38 on highway, even recently.
