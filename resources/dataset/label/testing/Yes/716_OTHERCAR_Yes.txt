            I am a long time Nikon fan and waited for them to deliver a high-end digital camera for the consumer market. Having worked in the advertising world, I was exposed to high-end digital equipment for 5 years, now I can say that you cannot go wrong with the Coolpix 950. It delivers great image resolution if you want to print 8x10 glossy pictures, and is fast for web publishing or sending email pictures to friends. 

There are a few drawbacks that can be overcome. First, all digital cameras eat batteries like you wouldn't believe. So get 8 rechargable AA batteries and a charge (with car adapter). Next spend $40 on a SanDisc media card reader. If you try and download an image from the camera to the computer it will normally take between 1-2 minutes. This is excrutiating slow if you have many images. And finally, get a 32MB memory card because the *MB card doesn't hold enough images.

I bought this camera last year for $650 on Buy.com; you can probably find them for $625 or $600 on the web now.
