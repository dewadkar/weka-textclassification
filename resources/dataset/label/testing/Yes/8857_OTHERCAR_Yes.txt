            What can you say about the Accord.  It is comfortable, reliable and not too hard on the eyes.  I am 6' 6&quot; tall and the Accord offers ample legroom.  The fit and finish are excellent as well.  The SE was a nice compromise for me.  The SE package includes alloy wheels (makes a big difference in the cars appearance), keyless entry, ABS (insurance discount), &amp; fake wood trim (can do without this).  These options add up to approximately $1700 and are discounted from the sticker price.  

There was not much room to bargain due to the popularity of the Accord but I did manage to get the car for $19,500.  The sticker was 20,900.  I was happy with that.  I did have to add a CD player to the car that added about $300.  

I have owed this Accord for 4 months now and the car is great.  The ride is very smooth.  The handling is also exceptionally responsive for a &quot;family car&quot;.  I have the 4-cylinder engine and the power is adequate.  If you have the extra money I would go for the 6-cylinder.  It would be nice to have the extra power when merging into traffic or passing.

I don't know what else to say if you want good quality at a fair price go for the Honda Accord!
