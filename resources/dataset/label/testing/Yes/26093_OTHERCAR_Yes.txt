            i recently bought a new '99 mazda protege. it is a very reasonably priced car. I bought the ES which comes with air bags, anti lock breaks, a sun roof, rims and a nice stereo system. I use it to go to and from college mostly and it drives smoothly and has not caused me a problem yet. The style is cute. It sort of reminds me of a 4 door honda civic. The greatest part of the protege is that i am six feet tall with long legs and i sit very well in the car. my knees do not get in the way of the steering wheel and i do not feel cramped. it has a large interior space for tal people and the back seats and reasonably roomy as well for a small car. i fit four adults in my car comfortable. the size of the trunk is also a nice size for a compact car. my car is black with grey fabric interior. it looks nice and i am happy with my color choice. it also looks good in silver and sand. the windshield wipers work very well also. many people don't think about that sometimes but my last car had horrible wipers and i hated it. i am a college student and this is my first car. i hate to drive but i love driving this car. i drive about 220 miles between home and school, mostly highway driving and i go through about a half a tank of gas which I think is a pretty good. all my friends love my car and my brother is very jealous and always wants to use it. it is very easy to handle and getting used to. <br><br>
