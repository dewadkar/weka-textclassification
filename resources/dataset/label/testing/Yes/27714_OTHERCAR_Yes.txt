             I bought my 1996 eclipe brand new it was the base model with power nothing, The car is great I love it its fast reliable and good on gas for being such as fast sporty car. The car I drove only 100,000 miles and it still is holding up strong never stalled or never had any mechanical problems with it. The only proble is the passenger seats if your a tall guy you do not want this car im 6,2 and this car is too small for me especially when you have passengers in the back seats, You feel uncomfortable and all crunched up. However this car is really nice if you have no kids and just want to party and go fast and looking stylish at the same time. I would not reccoment this car to a family of 4 or more due to how small it is. And the car can also go very fast you can hit 0-60 in about 4 seconds with the standard 5 speed.
