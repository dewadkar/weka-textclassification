            aside from the 2.5 megapixel CCD that produces 1712x1368 pixel images, the olmypus 2500L just feels good in my hands.  i originally bought this camera thinking that i would further my education in photographic techniques and this camera has done just that.  because the camera is touted as a true SLR, all images are framed in the viewfinder, not the LCD like typical digital cameras.  but then again, this is no typical digital camera.

one nice feature of the camera is the onboard 16MB buffer which allows you to take images one after another, so you don't have to wait after taking a picture to take the next shot, which has always hampered the use of digital cameras in the past.

the camera utilizes an infrared beam to assist in auto-focusing in darker situations, but don't count on it to help you in pitch dark areas, like caves.  you're better off switching to the manual mode and adjusting the focus and aperture settings manually.  the controls to set the aperture and focus are set by a push of a button.  though this may seem easy and it is very intuitive, this makes for adjusting focus a bit cumbersome if you are in need of adjusting focus manually and quickly.  for most situations, the autofocus tends to produce clean, crisp images.

the camera comes with the normal assortment of features one would expect from a high end camera.  the 5% spot metering mode is particularly useful when trying to achieve good exposures in difficult lighting situations.  one nice, though odd, feature of the camera is that it accepts both compactflash and smartmedia cards.  the camera comes equipped with a CF+ type I slot, so it cannot take ibm microdrives.  

a remote control is included to operate the camera from afar.  this remote control comes in handy when taking pictures with long exposure times, so you won't shake the camera and get blurry images.

the camera has a macro mode, but also has a super macro mode, used for super close picture taking.  a novel and unique feature of this camera.

to download the images from your camera to the computer, olympus decided to use a serial interface, so expect download times to be long when each image is approximately 450kB big.  i would definitely recommend getting a USB card reader (the microtech usb cameramate is excellent).

i love this camera.  probably still a little too clunky to use for the professional photographer, this camera is well suited for camera enthusiasts who are comfortable with the traditional SLR format.

let's talk accessories:

the 3x optical zoom produces crisp clean pictures, and the olympus 1.45X telephoto lens will give you a little more zoom for your money.  the olympus 1.45X zoom lens can only be used in full telephoto mode, meaning that when you put the lens on, you can only take images in ~4.5X zoom, otherwise you'll see the barrel of the zoom lens in the camera.

i also got the B28 wide angle lens, which i find a must much more versatile than the 1.45X zoom lens.  the only drawback with the wide angle lens is that the on-camera flash cannot be used because the lens is so big that a shadow will be produced if a flash is used.  you'll have to use a hot shoe flash or external light sources to light up the subject when shooting with the wide angle lens from olympus.

the barrel of the camera has plastic threads, so you'll have to make sure to screw the step-up rings in first and then the lenses into the step up ring to make sure you don't ruin the threads, but the threads seem quite durable and have not yet shown any signs of wear after heavy use of the wide angle lens.<br><br>
