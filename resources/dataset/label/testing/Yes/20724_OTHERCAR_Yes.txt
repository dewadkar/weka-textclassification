            I have a 98 4dr LS Blazer.  The Blazer, in my opinion is far better than its competitors (Explorer, 4-Runner, &amp; Pathfinder).  The Blazer has a lot of horses compared to others.  It is faster as well with it V-6 Vortec that pumps out 190.  I'll done a lot of customizing with mine and I get around 260 horses.  The Blazer has the best ride of all the SUVs I test drove and it is really quiet, just like the commerical says it would. The seats are really comfortable and the interior quality is quite impressive, nothing breaks real easily.  The engine noise is a little loud, but not nearly as loud as the Explorer.  The speed is limited at 96, a little less than the Explorer.  The looks are great and there are a lot of features.  The back seat is quite rommy considering the size of the vehicle.  The Blazer tows and carries a lot in terms of weight.  The trunk area is big as well and the cover for it is cleaverly hidden in the side.  The sound system is very impressive for being stock and the engine provides more than enough speed, especially off the line.   The automatic light on/off system is a great feature, especially if your really lazy or forgetfull like me.  The safety features go on and on and are really impressive.  Turning is a little bad since the turning radius is quite large.  Also the front pasenger leg room is not really big, so tall people may find it not too comfortable.  But when looking from an overall point of view the Blazer is far better than its competitors, especially when price is figured into your decision.  <br><br>
