            In early 1997, I was in the market for a new truck.  I had a Ranger, and I needed something bigger, as I was doing a lot more hauling.

I went and test drove a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Laramie with the 5.2l V8 and bought it the very same day!  I love it!

I've put nearly 80,000 miles on it in the 3.5 years that I've had it, and the only problem that I've had so far was a faulty power steering pump that they replaced without a problem!

I drive in Silicon Valley every day (through rough commute traffic), and get about 13-14 miles per gallon (which isn't bad, considering that my wife's Camry is only getting 22 in the same traffic), and it handles the roads extremely well.  

We've taken it up to Lake Tahoe several times, and it handles rain/snow/ice/mountain driving just beautifully!

If you're in the market for a hard-working truck, just go buy one of these.  You won't be sorry.<br><br>
