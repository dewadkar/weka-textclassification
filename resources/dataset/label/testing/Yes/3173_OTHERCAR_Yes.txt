            I have driven a 1995 Z28 since the fall of 1996.  Surprisingly the I fit into the Camaro quite well sine I'm about 6'5&quot;.  Only a long ride gets cramped.  The performance has improved as the engine gets broke in.  I still only has around 30k miles on it.  The only modification that has been made on it was a replacement K&amp;N filtercharger.  That provided some fun seat of the pants horsepower.  Gas mileage was not too depressing, yet the insurance is.  The cars wide tires get a bit restless in the rain.  If your looking to by a Camaro don't bother with the v6, the Z28 is the best bet.  <br><br>
