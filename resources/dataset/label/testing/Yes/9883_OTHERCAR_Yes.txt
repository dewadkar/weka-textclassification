            Go man go. My husband  was driving a 1995 Ford pickup, 4 cylinder, 4 speed transmission and boy did he get tired of peddling up these hills.  I had been encouraging him to go look at the new Dodge Dakota for over a year.  Sooo, one day we looked at them, drove one, then ordered a new bright red 1998 Dodge Dakota Extended Cab Pickup. It is a 6 cylinder,   and a 5 speed manual transmission, it also has 3.9L engine with fuel injection.  Also has a low speed rear end (axle ratio3.55) with anti-spin differential. That's why he didn't get 4 wheel drive as he didn't see the need for it. Cruise control works great.  It has a split bench seat with pulldown arm rest with storage in it.  Has am  AM/FM stereo radio with cassette player.  It also has a 36/36000 mile 24 hour road assistance guarantee.

He could hardly believe the performance of this truck.  It has good acceleration and he haven't had to peddle once. It is reasonably comfortable and the gas mileage is pretty good. He haven't checked the mileage for a long time.  There is lots of storage space in the extended cab so I like to take it shopping..It is easy to park, easy to drive and is a nice looking vehicle.  Any one would be proud to have it parked in their driveway.
