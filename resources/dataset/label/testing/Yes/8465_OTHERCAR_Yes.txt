            It's without doubt the best digital camera I ever had or tested in this price range. It couldn't get better. 

The optical zoom makes it better then most digital cameras. The bonus is that it can record a sequence of film and sound. Not so useful but fun if you don't want to bring a DV-camera to a party or event. 

It looks and feels and operates like a &quot;real&quot; camera. It also has a &quot;macro lens&quot;, useful when you want to take a picture of a small thing like a butterfly. 

Like all other digital cameras the only thing you have to think about is that if you take a close up you should use the display to focus since you don't look through the lens. 

The camera is comfortable to hold and doesn't weigh much. I have dropped mine a few times without anything happening to it. The look and feel is great and the pictures are even better. 

It's worth all the extra money it costs. It's so much better than all other digital cameras that aren't professional. You can't get a better camera for the same price.<br><br>
