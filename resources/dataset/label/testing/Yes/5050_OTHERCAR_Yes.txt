            I was in Miami for a week and a half and rented an Eclipse Spyder.  This car is visually appealing inside and out, but is widely considered a "chick car".  I liked the car when I got in it, as the console wraps around you, making you feel secure and secluded from the outside.  As I pulled out onto a main road, I heard the exhaust from this thing and was shocked by the deep-throated note that came from the oversized pipe.  As a german car fan, i was impressed to see a sound like that come out of a Japanese car.
At a couple times in my trip I had to park in a parking deck, which wasn't too easy because between the windshield and the passenger window lies too much plastic which rids you of your view when turning right. So I had to lean up off my seat occasionally to check where the curbs were as well as how close I was to the car next to me. When the top is up, good luck switching lanes using that small back window, but I guess such is the case when dealing with a convertible.
Pulling onto the highway, the 35mph to 60mph seemed pretty swift, especially with the clutchless "stick".  But after a toll I took off flooring it, I expected the car to be quite faster than it was, although it wasn't THAT bad.  Also, this car's tires would squeel at most turns, but I believe that to be the kind of pavement that is used in Florida because I swear I heard the same squeel coming from a Geo Metro.  A big thing I noticed was the transmission seemed confused a lot of the time, not knowing which gear to pick at certain speeds, and would shuffle between them before finding a good one.
Unfornately these cars were a dime-a-dozen in Miami, and in New Jersey, the non-spyder eclipse is all over the place too.  So if you buy this car, you'll surely be a member of the Cookie Cutter Club -- Probably mistaking one of 20 other cars in a parking lot for yours.  I guess that is what the "Panic" button can be used for.  
To sum it up, I may have been negative but it isn't really that bad of a car.  Mitsubishis have been known for poor craftsmenship, as the 2000 Galant had been recalled at least 4 times I know of already, so buyer beware with these, but for a nice convertible for an affluent person to buy their daughter, this car can't be beat.
