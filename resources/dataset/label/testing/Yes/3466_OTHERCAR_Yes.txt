            I bought this car last month during the 0% interest special GMAC was running. I just couldn't pass up a once in a lifetime deal like that.

I traded a Windstar minivan for this Bonneville and have had no regrets.  I liked the roominess of the van but never felt safe when driving it.  I had been used to driving a Camaro Z28 before the van and just could not adjust to the different handling.

My Bonneville has leather seats that are so-o-o-o-o-o-o-o soft and cushiony that I was able last week to ride 16 1/2 hours across part of six states without any stiffness or ill effects.  

The climate control (separate for driver and passenger) is a wonderful thing - just put it on the temperature you are comfortable with and it automatically stays there - no adjusting.

My children (grown with their own families) kidded me about driving an &quot;old person's car&quot; when I had the van. It was so different from the Camaro I'd had before.  Now they think driving Mom's car is okay because it is very sporty with the spoiler. 

Only a couple of things I don't care for in my Bonneville - but they are minor - not enough to want to trade it off - the red lights on the instrument panel are not easy for me to read, especially the clock (I need glasses only for close-up so don't like to wear them when I'm driving; the beverage holders are too narrow (when my husband puts his coffee cup in one, it extends into the other side leaving no room for a second up of anything); and the headrests on the front seats are a complete waste - you can't lean your head back to rest at all unless you keep a pillow with you because of the placement of it.  I am verrrrry short and can't even reach it, but those of my family who are taller can reach it but look up at the ceiling when trying to rest their head.

This car handles like a dream - hugs the curves, very smooth ride.  I feel very safe and comfortable driving this car - not to mention young and sporty.  

Don't take my word for it - test drive one.  I know you'll agree.  <br><br>
