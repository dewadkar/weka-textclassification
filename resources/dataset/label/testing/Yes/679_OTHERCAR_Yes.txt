            In July 1999 I could borrow a Nikon Coolpix 950 for a business trip to Las Vegas. This was the first time I used a digital camera and the results made some fun to watch. Even prints at 10x8 inches were not bad at all. As a result I had to buy myself an own Coolpix 950. From August to October I shot about 500 photos and was quite content with them. The nice thing about these compact cameras is, that one can carry it nearly all the time (the Coolpix is not even the smallest of its kind, but for taking pictures this is more a plus than a minus).

Here are some obvious limitation of such cameras.

-1600x1200 is not very much for larger prints (but it is reasonable) 
-the lenses are not up to good fixed lenses from Nikon and Canon 
-missing lens hoods reduce image quality 
-no removable lenses 
-viewfinder is to small and imprecise (most consumer cameras are not  
 SLR). It does not really allow to do good image composition (this is my
 main critique) 
-most cameras don't invite to be used on a tripod 

This might sound a bit negative. It is not because this camera is a big step towards digital photography. I just tried to talk about the inherent limitations for the ambitious photographer. 

Today my new F100 is the main camera but I would not like to miss the Coolpix 950.
