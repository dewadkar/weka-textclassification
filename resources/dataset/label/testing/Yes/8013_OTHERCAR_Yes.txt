               We purchased our 1997 Plymouth Grand Voyager in July of 1999.  We have always driven larger cars (Dodge Dynasty, Oldsmobile 88) and we were getting ready to take a vacation to visit family who lived over 2,000 miles away.  We currently owned a Dodge Dynasty which had over 120,000 miles on it and my husband was very nervous about driving it so far.  We never thought about buying a mini-van, but decided to check them out.  We live in the Detroit area and half the drivers in our area drive a mini-van. 

  We first looked at the Dodge Grand Caravan and the Ford Windstar, but were not impressed with either one.  Even thought the Dodge Grand Caravan is very similar to the Grand Voyager, the ones we looked at didn't have the extras that we wanted or all we could find were white or green.  We decided to check out one last car lot before calling it a day and happened to see this beautiful light blue Grand Voyager sitting on the lot.  It was a Sunday, so the car lot was closed, but we checked out what we could on the van and decided to come back the next day to take it for a test drive.

   The next day we returned to the car lot and inquired about the beautiful blue Grand Voyager that we had found the night before.  The salesman was very helpful and let us look inside and try all the knobs and buttons.  We decided to take it for a test drive and then go home and discuss it further.  Well, the minute my husband got behind the wheel and drove it out on the highway, he was hooked.  We went back to the dealership and signed the papers that same day.

   Our Grand Voyager has the luggage rack on the roof and it's surprisingly quiet.  We used it on our long trip and it worked perfectly.  All we used were a couple of tie down straps and everything stayed put.  Our van has the bench seats which our 5 year old daughter loves because it gives her extra room on the seat beside her to put her toys when we travel.  We normally keep the rear seat out unless we have extra passengers and this increases our cargo area. 

   The van has lots of cup holders and ours came with the Infinity stereo system with cassette and CD player.  Ours also has power windows and power side mirrors plus the ever popular cruise control which is very easy to turn on and off - you just punch a button on the steering wheel and it reacts almost instantly.  The seats are very comfortable and the seat belts all have the adjustable system. 

   We also have the dual climate control system both in the front and the rear of the van and absolutely love this feature.  If I am too warm or too cold, I can adjust my side of the van to the temperature that's comfortable for me while not changing the temperature on the other side.  What's really nice about the dual climate control is that the passengers in both the middle and rear seats can also adjust the temperature for their area without affecting the rest of the van.  If we have the air conditioner on and my daughter gets cold, she can turn off her fan above her and it doesn't affect us riding in the front seats.  I highly recommend this option if you are looking to purchase a mini-van.

   The Grand Voyager is very quiet on the inside when driving down the road and the ride is extremely smooth and easy.  We have the SE model which has a longer wheel base than the standard Voyager.  We also have the sliding doors on both sides which is another option that I highly recommend.  This is very convenient when you have extra passengers because it makes it easier to get in and out of the back seat area.  The lifting hatchback rear door is handy, too, for getting cargo in and out and you can open and close the door one handed.  The remote keyless entry system is another option that I highly recommend.  

   We took our long trip in our new mini-van and it was the most comfortable trip we have ever been on.  Even my daughter enjoyed it and that's no easy feat to accomplish!  This mini-van is truly a family vehicle and we are not at all sorry we bought it.  We love it!<br><br>
