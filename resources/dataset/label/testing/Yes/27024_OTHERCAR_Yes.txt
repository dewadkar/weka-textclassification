            Hello,

   I work for a professional digital photo developing lab that also sells digital cameras.  The D-450 camera is a great little camera, and I am going to explain to you the in's and out's.

Pro's:  

Size -This camera is a take-everywhere camera

Durable - Digital does not mean delicate here.  This is a rugged camera.

Very fast - The 450 is a bit quicker than its predecessor, the 400

SmartMedia - smaller, cheaper, and it fits in a floppy disk adapter.

*NEW* - The 450 has a wide angle LCD which can be viewed indirectly. 
    This means you and your pushy relatives can all view the LCD at once! 
    I personally compared the D-400 and the D-450's LCDs.

Also, the LCD is super crisp, fast and bright. 


Con's:

This bothered me:  The sliding door had to hit the lens assembly for the unit to retract the lens and close.  It seems like this action could cause wear, and eventually cause a distorted pictures or a loose lens assembly.  

Again, I see a flimsy door covering the smartmedia slot.  I do not believe this will be a problem, but just be super careful when changing smartmedia cards.

1.3 megapixel.  The pictures are great, but 1.3 megapixels will not produce true photo-quality 4x6's (I know they say it can produce 5x7's photoquality, but this is not true).  In my opinion, 1.3 megapixels produces an &quot;OK&quot; 4x6 digital print, but I can not call the 4x6 print photoquality.  Move up to at least a 2.1 megapixel camera if you are looking for true photoquality prints.  
 
No threads on the lens.  Don't expect to put a wide angle, fisheye, telephoto, or any filter on this camera.  No fun for the person who loves accessories (like me).

The buttons are confusing at first.  After a while, you get used to them, but I still would have liked to see a better button layout.


Overall:
   This is a good first time camera. A 1.3 megapixel camera can make great internet photos, but the 3.3 megapixel cameras are just starting 
to come onto the market, and you will see a drop in the 2.1 megapixel camera market.  Pick up a good 2.1 megapixel camera now, like the olympus 2020 or 2000 or the nikon coolpix 950, and it can totally replace your 35mm point and shoot camera.  This camera's biggest weakness is it's 1.3 megapixel resolution.  If you are new to digital camera's, this model will satisfy you, just make sure you get it for a good price.<br><br>
