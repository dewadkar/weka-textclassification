            I've always been intrigued by Ford Mustangs.  Finally, as an adult, I was able to afford my first car.  So, predictably I picked a 2001 Ford Mustang.  

First off, I was impressed by the design of the body.  Yes, that is not what makes a car, but it caught my attention and catches other people's attention as well!  The 2001 version comes in great colors, and Ford brought back the banana yellow color for 2001.  I, on the other hand, picked the evil looking "Tropical Blue," which does not look "tropical" at all.  A metallic blue that turns almost black at night.  There are basically four models of the 2001 Mustang: the V6 model, the GT, the Bullit, or the SVT Cobra.  For the V6 and GT models, there is the option of purchasing a convertible or coupe.  The V6 model comes with a 3.8 liter engine and the GT comes with a 4.6 liter engine.

The American legend can be purchased at a fairly decent price.  Prices may range from $16,000(V6 Coupe)-$37,000(SVT Cobra).  I personally got my V6 Mustang for $18,000.  Not bad for having 17" rims, the boss spoiler, tinted headlights, a 5 cd disc changer, the 460 Mach Sound System and leather steering wheel options thrown in!

The power of the Mustang is decent.  It cannot compare to the Camaro or Firebird, but it hauls enough as.s.  193hp for the V6 model, 260hp for the GT, 280hp for the Bullit and a whopping 360hp for the SVT Cobra!

The Mustang is still rear wheel drive, which should be kept that way.  Yet, because of being rear wheel drive, the handling is not as great.  The shape of the car does not help as well, making it feel like steering a box on sharp turns.  But you gotta love the sound of peeling out!

I was surprised that Ford installed the traction control.  This is great for rain or snow.

Gas mileage is decent.  20/29mpg for the V6 model and 18/26 for the GT.

In my opinion, the hood scoop is cheesy.  The fake plastic looks good from afar, but when you look at the car close up, it is quite lame.  If they were going to make a fake hood scoop they should have made the grill metal instead of cheap plastic.  

The interior is nice.  But being a short person, the controls for the A/C and CD/Radio is out of reach and inconvenient.  The seats are decent to sit in for short rides, but for long rides it becomes a bit of torture for your behind.  Interior options are: leather steering wheel cover and the Mach(tm) sound system (which kicks!) to name a few.  You can have the choice of a CD player and tape player/radio or the 5 CD disc changer that changes your discs upfront and not in the trunk! The roominess is not all that great.  It's quite ok being in the front, but if you're stuck in the back, then you are screwed.  But hey it is a sports car and not a family sedan.  Trunk space is limited, but bigger in sq inches than the Camaro.

The shocks are not that great.  It is a quiet ride, but going over the bumps are a little painful.  The braking is superior. Another option is the choice of having the 16" or 17" alloy rims.  I chose the 17" rims and it is a perfect addition to making your Stang look great.

So far, my Stang has been reliable.  With proper maintenance, you won't be "Fixing or Repairing Daily," or "Found On Road Dead."  It is a sturdy car that has not given me a bit of trouble.  There are a few cons here and there about the 2001 Mustang, but hey nothing is perfect.  I can say that I am a satisfied customer.
