            Got this camera a week ago, and have been very pleased with it. I have lots of 35mm gear, which I use for more &quot;serious&quot; hobby photography, and so the main qualities I wanted in a digital camera were portability and cost savings in film/processing. I think it is a great compliment to my other cameras. Since I will use this mainly for sharing photos online with my family, where the resolution does not need to be so high, I thought this camera would be convenient.

The powershot uses compact flash cards, so if you go on vacation and don't have access to a computer to dump your pictures onto, you may want to pick up extra memory. I got 2 48MB cards, in addition to the 8MB that comes with it. The battery doesn't last very long if you use the LCD screen, but I usually look thru the viewfinder anyways. The menu system took a little while to get used to, but now it seems very natural and well laid out. There are a few tricks that are in the manual that you wouldn't figure out by just using the camera. For instance, to see the picture you just took, keep holding down the shutter release button. Then, you can also delete it immediately.

Connecting the camera to a computer to download pictures is really simple. Just install the software that comes on CD, and when you plug the camera into your USB port, the software will automatically start. Works great on both my iMac, and my PC.

A really cool thing is the photo-stitch feature and software. You can make a panorama by combining several photos together. Using the lcd screen, you can line up shots side by side, then using the software, you can stitch or merge the photos together to get a very wide shot. You can even do a 360-degree panorama and make a Quicktime VR movie with the software. I did this on my Mac, and it can do it on the PC too, if you have Quicktime 4 installed.

The quality of the images is fantastic! I am upgrading from a Sony DSC-F1 Cybershot which is a few years old, and only did 640x480. The Canon's resolution is so much better (file size is bigger too), and you have the option of 3 sizes. Switching between them is easy.

The camera is so small, I carry it around with me all the time. After lugging around my 35mm gear, this is like a dream. Of course, you don't have any depth of field control with this camera (you can adjust exposure +/- 2, I think), but as a handy point-and-shoot, it is fantastic! Also, since it uses the same (or close to it) body as the other Canon APS Elph/IXY cameras, it is more discreet. With my cybershot, I had to always deal with questions about that camera. Not a big deal, but still... People are more comfortable when a picture is taken with a &quot;normal&quot; camera, looking thru the viewfinder.

I think we will have this camera for years to come! I recommend it!<br><br>
