            Why we love our Chevy Tahoe. The Tahoe has plenty of room for our family of four. We have two small boys (4 &amp; 2 years old) and they can't reach each other when they are in there car seats. This is a plus because they are always trying to pick on each other. I feel completely safe driving everyone around in our Tahoe. It is the most dependable SUV that I have driven in. Our family had a Mitsubishi Montero before our Tahoe. There is three times as much room and we don't feel like we are going to tip over. I recommend the Chevy Tahoe to anyone that wants a dependable ruff-and -tumble vehicle.<br><br>
