            I bought a used 94 Accord last year based on recommendations from various Accord owners and Honda's overall reputation   for making solid and reliable cars.  People routinely drive Hondas well past 100K (and often 200K) and think nothing of it, provided you maintain them well.  In my Accord, every button, light, and power option still works after 9 years of service, nothing rattles or squeaks, and the paint still shines up quite nicely.  At least back in 1994, Honda produced a very high-quality and solid product with its Accord.  Driving on the highway, the car still routinely gets 28-30 mpg.  In mixed driving, it typically gets about 25 mpg, and I have never achieved much below 20 mpg since I bought it.  

On the reliability side, the Accord has only failed to start and drive once in the past year on account of an old distributor cap and worn spark plug wires.  While those are supposedly maintenance items, most people simply let them go until they stop working.  

It has been a reliable, economical, and comfortable means of transportation.  You get in, start the engine (there is a very reassuring sound to Honda and Acura engines), and drive off.  It does nothing exceptionally well, but it does most things well enough.  It does not ask much of the driver, simply doing its job of getting you from point A to B well.  

However, if there were a few "superior" features of the car, they would be the interior ergonomics (impressive for a 1994) and its handling and suspension, which are a notch above the other cars in its class.   I'm always a little surprised at how well it corners, how firm and balanced the ride is, and how sure-footed it seems in all weather conditions.  For example, my friends and I drove the Accord from MA to NH to go skiing when it was snowing quite hard out once, and it held its own on the snow-covered highways.  I saw about 10 spin-outs along the way, including a few 4X4 SUVs, but my Accord moved along just fine at a moderate pace.  It almost felt pinned to the road (part of it was likely the tires), giving me a great deal of confidence in its ability to get us there safely.  Of course, it was certainly not like all-wheel drive, but the traction and handling was just about as good as you can expect from a front-wheel drive car when mated to good tires.  My family's front-wheel drive Chrylser minivan doesn't handle half as well in the snow.  

I would only criticize the car in two main areas: it needs just a bit more power and the automatic transmission is often jerky with its downshifts.   I have the LX model, so the engine is the standard 2.2 liter 4 cylinder with 130 HP, which is smooth, revvy, and relatively quiet, but its only just adequate in terms of performance.  I'm sure the Accord is a lot faster and more fun to drive with the V-6 in the later models or the VTEC 4-cylinder that almost all Accords have as standard equipment now.  Of course, the basic in-line 4 is reliable and pretty smooth for a 4-cylinder, but it lacks the power to truly make driving the Accord fun.  Don't get me wrong, it accelerates and passes on the highway just fine, but only "just fine."  Again, this car does most things quite well, but offers nothing too exciting for the driver.  In many ways, it's the epitome of good, basic transportation.  

Also, the automatic transmission can be a bit jerky at times.  While smooth enough on upshifts, it can downshift with a noticeable jerk on the highway.  It won't spill your morning coffee, but the jerk certainly lets you know it just shifted.  While I was initially nervous it was my car's particular transmission, it is a typical complaint on older Honda cars from what I can gather.  I suppose you can consider it a fair trade-off for an automatic transmission that is know to last a lot longer than average with proper maintenance.  Again, if I had found an Accord with a 5-speed, it would a bit more fun, but what can you do? 

In short, I would highly recommend the 94 Accord LX for someone who doesn't expect a lot of performance and excitement out of a car, but expects affordable, reliable, and comfortable everyday transportation.  It's ideal for a college student on a relatively tight budget (like me).   From what everyone says, they last a very long time provided you can find a well-maintained one and keep it that way.  To be honest, I expect that I will simply get bored with my Accord long before it begins to fall apart or needs any serious attention.  So far, I'm sold on Honda's products, so at least the current Accord looks more fun and Acura always makes some fun and exciting cars when the day comes to retire my 94 Accord ...
