            My old Sunbird had broken down for the last time and I told the auto rep over the phone to not fix it because I was looking for another car.  I'm in the business world and I wanted a car that would represent well, but I was afraid I'd be stuck with something I could afford instead of something I didn't want.  When I went to pick it up I spent time in looking at the other Pontiac's and then the Hyundai's at the end.  I loved the way the Sonata looked from the back, like an Infiniti.  It drove great and had everything I wanted for 5-6k less than what I was looking for.  

2 years later, the car still rides like brand new.  I've had no major issues with it, the air and heat crank!  It's the smoothest riding car I've owned.  The pick up is okay, but to be honest it's best when you use Amoco Ultimate.  I've tried other 93 octane gas and they improve performance but not like Amoco's.

Some other nice standards/features: Power sunroof, windows and locks.  Electronic side mirrors.  Has a wide cargo net in the trunk, and the seats in the back fold down so you can transport long objects.  I throw my bike back there, no problem.  Air Bags all around.  Stereo sound is good, I didn't upgrade to the cd/cassette stereo, but it has two 4 inch speakers in the door, two 6x9's in the back and two tweeters up front.  The sound is loud, but if you want to crank I would suggest an amplifier or the higher stereo.  Has two cup holders, decent size console.  Wide back seat, very roomy.

If your like me and would like a nice looking car, packed with everything, for a very affordable price you should definitely look at this.  There's no reason to spend 5-10k more on an Accord, this has it all.  GO see for yourself and test drive it.  You'll be convinced.<br><br>
