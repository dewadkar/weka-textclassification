            I bought this camera because of it's price/picture quality ratio.
I looked at Fuji, Kodak,Sony, and others but the quality of the photos was my number one criteria.

I am very pleased with it.  The software is vastly superior to what other manufacturers provide as well - don't overlook that.

It also was more capable of taking pictures in low light, which I really like.  It is small enough to shove into a pocket and the ergonomics are top rate.

Battery life could be better, so buy a spare.  My sister in law just bought the newer S-100 and I'll bet it's as good or better.  Remember, more megapixels doesn't just mean better resolution, it also means way more cost, way more memory required.  I just don't see a need for any more resolution for this.  The pictures are very very good.

Optical zoom is a must.  Too bad it's only 2X though.<br><br>
