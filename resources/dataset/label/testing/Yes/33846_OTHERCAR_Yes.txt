            I wrote back on 3/25 my PA was the bomb, still is! Now I've over 10K on the car and a grand total of sltly over 55K miles on it. Took a 900 mile trip to what seemed like the subtropics in LA, returned 28.7 mpg while crusing at superlegal speeds. My family enjoyed a very comfy ride and always had plenty of room for stretch-outs and naps.

Now as gasoline prices soar, I even more  glad  I ridded my  self of my gas pig V8 Explorer. At what price are  we Americans wanting to go to be chic. I have developed no problems w/the vechicle and am glad of my smart purchase. Folks, ask yourselves this question: is owning a gas-hog SportUte really worth  what you are  surrendering at the pump? My  car gets 2nd, 3rd glances from even younger  people. My car pounds out a smooth 240 bhp (brake horsepower) and can run to 60 in 7.2 sec. My car can stop from 60 in less than 120 feet in about 3.5 sec. 

I'm enamoured  w/my vehicle. If you are considering a PA, get the ULTRA w/Gran Sport suspension. Get a good  mechanic  to  check over it good and then offer the dealer  about 2000  less than he's asking. He'll see  it your way. Great  car.<br><br>
