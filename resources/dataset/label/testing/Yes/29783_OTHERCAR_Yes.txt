            My first car was a 1991 Mercury Tracer handed down to me from my parents.  When I received it in 1995, it already had over 100,000 miles on it, and although the maintenance history was spotty, the only work it had needed to that point was a new timing belt.

Over the two years I owned it, I logged on another 42,000 miles, replaced the clutch, water pump, thermostat, and front shocks.   It started on the first try for over 142,000 miles, the engine stayed strong, with no noticeable loss in power.  There was no rust, very little wear on the seats, and the only thing that didnt work properly was the gas gauge. This is quite a compliment given that the car was wrecked several times, was my manual tranny &quot;learner&quot;, and all-in-all led a not at all pampered life.

It was a well equipped model, with power sunroof, cruise, power mirrors, and CD player, and the sticker price back in late 1990 was around 12,000 dollars.  The car was well worth that price, and I would gladly buy another. When the time came to replace it, I looked at the new Tracer model and was disappointed.  The 1997 Tracer's engine lacked the familiar pep I had grown accustomed to, and the interior felt cheaper.  Besides, any car that doesn't offer a moonroof as an option doesn't garner much attention from me!

<b>Update</b>--<i>After reading a lot of other epinions on all sorts of cars and trucks, I thought it would be useful to outline the repairs (outside of normal maintenance) that the cars I write about have had to undergo.  Let me know if this is helpful!</i>

<b>80,000 miles</b>--Timing Belt Broke (while traveling at highway speeds, fortunately no damage to engine.

<b>100,000 miles</b>--Front brake calipers gave up the ghost.

<b>105,000 miles</b>--Front struts replaced after rough ride develops.

<b>112,000 miles</b>--Original clutch finally goes (probably would have lasted longer--for more info see my review on Patriot Ford)

<b>120,000 miles</b>--Original thermostat replaced.

<b>140,000 miles</b>--Original water pump fails.  Second timing belt replaced as a preventative measure. 

<b>142,000 miles</b>--Engine develops a &quot;miss.&quot;  A week in the shop fails to correct the problem.  Hungry for a new car, I trade off the Tracer.
