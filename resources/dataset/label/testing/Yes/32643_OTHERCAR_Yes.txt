            I've had my '97 Sunfire GT for 3.5 years and have been mostly pleased.  Overall, it's a reasonably comfortable drive and it's been low maintenance so far.  

After 48,000 miles I've had it in the shop a few times, but always because A) I hit something or B) someone hit me.  I have had some weirdness with the anti-lock brakes but the dealer claims it's from hitting a pot hole and killing an ABS sensor.  I'm not sure I believe that, but so be it - things seem to be okay now.  Also, I've had CDs get stuck in the CD deck a couple times but I use it literally all the time so I may be a little harder on it than most.

A few things I don't like:
- The headroom is low, particularly in the back seat.  It doesn't bother me but tall friends always complain.  
- Blind spots - big ones, particularly along the left side. The post between windows makes it really bad - don't forget to check 'em good.
- Lot of road noise.
- Hard (or impossible) to find a bike rack that works.

I have a sunroof (a salesman talked me into it dangit) but I like it.  If you're tired and you open it about 4 inches, you get a nice blast of wind on your forehead to wake you up.  

Be careful which wheels you get - the top 16&quot; ones that come with the goodies package are EXPENSIVE if you ever have to replace them - around $380 apiece!  I've replaced two unfortunately.

I still like driving it and I don't really have any major complaints.  If you're looking to buy, sit in it and make sure you fit! <br><br>
