            I recently purchased a Pontiac Grand Am.  Okay, I really wanted a new Mustang, but I was given a great price on the Grand Am and went for it.  Now I'm wondering if I made the right move.  While it handles great, I'm noticing that it's really sluggish in the morning, even more so than I am.  Like me, it has trouble getting into gear, and when I ease on the accelerator, it refuses, politely of course, to budge.  I am now facing two options:  1) take it back where I got it, or 2) give it a swift kick in the trunk.  

It's really a pretty car, if I dare use the word pretty to describe a car.  Okay, it's hot.  Really hot looking, and perhaps that's why I so readily agreed to settle for a Grand Am vs. a Mustang.  Well, at least I don't have to worry about Grandma asking me for the keys to my car.  The last car she drove right off the road at about 50 mph.  The police later said they had clocked her going about 85 on the freeway.  Grandma's not getting near this car.  No way!
