            Volvo S70

This was our second Volvo.  First one purchased in mid-1980s.  Found this to be a very different car, with some of its strengths and weaknesses from early years still intact.  Now had the car for a few months with about 6,500 miles on it.  Here's my first report:

+ STRENGTHS:
1. Safety: no safer car in its class, according to Volvo reports.  That's the primary reason I purchased the car.  To best insure the safety and well-being of my family I'm willing to compromise on just about everything else.  
2. AC/Heat: wonderful improvement over Volvo from the 80s. Cools nicely in the summer; heat comes on faster than it did in the past.
3. Radio/CD: we purchased the upgraded system which is very nice.
4. Mileage: about 18-20 in the city.
5. Pickup: very nice for the basic S70. Faster engine will result in tickets...and frankly don't think it's worth it.
6. Parts, labor and service: expensive to maintain even with &quot;extended warranty&quot; relative to domestic cars.
7. Comfort: a smooth ride for a &quot;foreign&quot; car.
  
- WEAKNESSES:
1. Quality: Surprised to find the &quot;old Volvo rattle&quot; still around after 10 years.
2. Roominess: not everyone is 5'6&quot;.  Couldn't they spare a little room for legs in front and back?!
3. Radio/CD: the standard system is awful.  If you enjoy music...upgrade.
4. Gas mileage: about 25-30 on highway going well over 65 MPH
5. Style: very much improved.  Some nice extras but I hope they figure out how to make cup holders that hold real cups.  Could use more storage and place to store and hold portable phones.
6. The Extras: there were none in the early 80s.  Now you feel a little pampered...but not too much.
7. Comfort: not as smooth a ride as U.S. domestics in its class.

Who should drive this car? 
Nice city car: easy to park, slim and handles well.  A little bit thirsty on in-city gas.

If you're looking for a safe car: this is a great choice.  If your number one concern is comfort, style, or costs you should look elsewhere. (Buicks, Toyota Avalon, etc.).
