            Finally, and after a very long wait, Nissan has released its new 3.5 ltr V6 engine and 240 hp which is the highest horsepower in its class, even higher than Grand Cherokee, Explorer and Blazer.  Currently I drive a 1997 Pathfinder which has the previous 3.3 ltr, 168 hp engine which is kind slow specially at the first kick, but on the highway it feels fine and fast.  Powertran is very reliable, finishing is superb and overall performance is excellent, it just needed little more power to it.  I have been waiting for about a year for the 2001 model with the new engine so I can trade my old 97 for the new 2001.  
Finally, I had the opportunity to test drive the new Path yesterday.  I was so excited and was willing to trade in my 97 even before driving the new model.  With 70 horsepower more than what I have and bigger 3.5 engine and the new body design, you can't go wrong.  I drove the new Path for about 15 minutes and I was not impressed at all with the new engine, it still noisy and you can't tell the difference between the 170hp and 240hp, interior is basically the same as my old 97.  I felt that I was still driving my old car, everything felt the same except the newer smell.
the pathfinder overall is a great truck and I highly recommend it, but don't expect a dramatic improvement in engine performance than older model.  
Remember, this is a new engine, I suggest you wait for the professional reviews and recall information before you buy or trade.<br><br>
