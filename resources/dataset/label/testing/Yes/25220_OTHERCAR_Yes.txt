            In 2001 my husband bought me a red Celica GT for college graduation.  For two years I loved that car.  However, once my daughter was born, the last 15 months in that car were unpleasant - Celicas were not designed for a car seat (it did better than expected, but that's a different review).

The problem was what car could I afford that looked good, performed well, and had four doors?

Because of a transmission problem, Toyota loaned us a 2004 Corolla LE for three weeks.  Before I ever started the car I was impressed - what took 15 minutes to get the car seat in the Celica took 2 minutes in the Corolla.  The day I picked up my Celica I accosted a saleslady to trade it in.

This review is on the new 2004 Corolla S we purchased on December 22nd.  I've put 450 miles on it in one week.  As a replacement for my Celica, it has far exceeded everything I expected.

<b>Stats:</b>  2004 Corolla S, Super White, 4 sp Automatic, power windows/locks & remote entry, deluxe AM/FM/Cass/CD 4spkr upgrade.

<b>Performance:</b> I expected to be disappointed with the power.  However, 130hp (even in the automatic) is more than enough to get up and go.  It will chirp tires from a stop, it will do over 100mph, and while it won't win a serious drag race, I'm usually first off the line at casual stoplights.  It easily holds it own on the freeway, and the automatic drops gears quickly for more than adequate passing strength when requested.

It has been an adjustment to go from a manual to an automatic, but not because of a drop in power.  In fact, when I went back to the Celica I noticed it took longer to get the manual into the powerband (over 4200rpm) than it did for the automatic to produce quick bursts of power.

Based on the rental and my aggressive driving style, I expect around 35mpg.  Tank holds 13.5 gallons, fuel light comes on around 11 gallons and reads empty at 12.

<b>Interior:</b>  The LE we borrowed was NICE.  The wood trim accentuated the clean lines and roomy interior, which was well laid out.  The white display was surprisingly easy to read.  The type S has the same layout and white display (type S has red filled lettering, a small touch but I like it); the interior is black instead of light gray.  The wood trim is gone, the dash is wrapped by black leather, and the steering wheel is leather-wrapped as well.  The end result is a cozier feel, although there is no real difference.

The cabin has lots of room.  My 6' and my husband's 6'6" fit well, with enough room for him to lay the seat back enough even with the car seat installed behind the passenger.    Leg room is not an issue.  He could even ride in the back seat, which my sister-in-law declared surprisingly roomy and very comfortable, even compared to her Land Rover.

Once concern has been that I have the driver's seat all the way back, but keep thinking I would like another inch or so.    This is in part because I drive sitting straight up.  I'm comfortable, by all means, and so is my husband, but another inch would have been perfect.  Drivers under 6' will never even notice.  Passenger side is perfect.

<i>THERE IS A BLIND SPOT.</i>  For cars in the next lane it's not bad, but I did lose a car two lanes to my right that I knew was there, but couldn't find, even when I turned my head to look.  Careful mirror placement is critical, and I will be getting one of those extra mirrors just to be safe.

Cabin sounds are minimal, and so far I haven't heard any odd cabin noises.  The rental (13k miles) didn't have any, either.  One comment would be the sound of the air system when set on High - the whooshing sound is loud enough to make me turn up the radio or talk louder.  Cell phones pick this up, too.  Once the car heats up I turn the fan to a medium or low; this was an issue in the Celica, too.

The only other issues have been with the radio placement and window controls.  In the Celica, the radio was just a touch above the shifter, making adjustments quick, and with a small raised dot on the "3" button I didn't need to look to change the station.  The Corolla has the radio on top, meaning a reach up and over, often requiring a glance to locate the selectors.

Also, the window controls on the Celica are located in the center console, while the Corolla has the traditional door placement.  My preference is for the center placement - they didn't get wet if it rained while I had the window down, and were just a flick away.  The Corolla requires a larger movement to find the controls; something I would change if I could.

Power windows are standard only on the LE version.

As for storage compartments, there's so many I still don't think I've found them all.  On some other reviews people have noted that the driver's visor hits the rear-view mirror.  This is true in my car.  However, it doesn't bother me.  Everything else is standard, the air controls are similar and well-placed, there's not much to say.

<b>Exterior:</b>  I didn't want an ugly car!  The Corolla looks like a Jetta and a Lexus got busy behind the bushes.  Spoilers are an option but not required to make the car look whole, unlike the Celica (I don't have one).  The antenna is placed on top of the car and has a cool wraparound effect.

The type S comes with extra ground effects and fog lights, but the clearance is still plenty to avoid parking lot bumpers and curbs.  There aren't many decorative creases or swells.  While it may have a 'bland' look, there is an advantage - this car won't be as expensive to fix for cosmetic damage.  Paint quality seems decent - I opted out of the "Lusterizing Sealant Package."

<b>Ride:</b>  The car rides smooth, but does let you feel imperfections in the road.  I like it this way.  For some people this might be a turn-off.  It's less than the Celica, less than a RAV4, more than a Lexus or BMW.  I didn't get it, but one of the options is sound-shielding.

Because of the higher roof line and narrower body profile, wind shifts have a significant effect on this car over the Celica.  This week we've had gusts up to 30mph, it wasn't bad but could surprise an unwary driver.

I haven't had to drive in rain yet.  Based on running through sprinklers, I don't think it will be a problem.

<b>Insurance:</b>  My insurance dropped by $185/6mo.  While this is a subjective number that will not be true for anyone else, it was an unexpected benefit of moving from the Celica to the Corolla.  Always something to consider when changing vehicles.

<b>Overall:</b>  I'm not 24 anymore.  What was perfect then wasn't so impressive anymore, and as my priorities changed, the Celica wasn't flexible enough to fulfill my needs.  The Corolla meets both my current needs (4 doors) and wants (good looks and semi-sporty performance).  I believe the Corolla will continue to meet my standards, expectations, and needs as the years go by.

The only way in which the Celica outshined the Corolla was in the "WOW" factor.  I will miss the drive-thru teenagers checking out the car, their "Cool car!" comments, and the vanity from catching the reflection in store windows.  But I won't miss hurting my back trying to get my child in and out of the car seat.  I like being able to put some friends in the back and going around town, in comfort.

If you've read this far, thanks!  Hope the information was helpful.  I did hours of research on this car, got a good deal at the dealership, and a large part of that was based on reviews I read here.  =)
