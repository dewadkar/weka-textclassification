            This car has a combination of excellent acceleration and brake, that makes driving is nimble and safe.  Handling and cornering are stable.  You feel attached to the ground.   These, together with the price, are the reasons why I chose G35 after two test drives.  I did not like the exterior that much at the beginning.  I thought the freshness would fade away soon.  Unexpectedly,  after owing for several months now and looking at it from different angles, I found I like it better.  

Interior is unfortunately below an average for 30-35K priced cars.  They used rather cheap plastics.  Our other cars (of $25K from different companies) have visibly nicer interiors with better materials.  I feel Nissan did cost-cutting on interiors, and they did so OBVIOUS- a mistake.    G35 is a bit too noisy to me. It is clearly noisier than most TOYOTA cars-yes-different concepts.  One may want to enjoy the V6 engine sound , but if you  want to enjoy  i.e. classic music, it may not easy with G35 on free-ways.    It is a good idea to test-drive on a freeway to see the noise level is comfortable for you.  The interior is relatively spacious for sports sedan of this price range, but remember this is a driver-oriented car, not really a family car.  You really need to sit every seat to find out if it is OK with you and your family, if you consider G35 for your family.

I did not choose Bose stereo, which I immediately did not like on my test drive.  I am very happy with my standard Clarion audio system, which is an excellent one in G35.  This is strange, since I found the Bose system was great in Altima that I test-drove.  Somehow it does not generate a quality sound in G35?  So I felt.  Weird.

 With my current mileage at 1000, my overall satisfaction about G35 is pretty high, which comes from the power, brake, handling, style, relative roominess, and the price.
