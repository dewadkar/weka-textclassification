            This car may have been designed for the first-time buyer, but it's absolutely perfect for this 50 year old suburbanite.  What was I looking for?  Space, to begin with - my Echo replaces an aging Sedan de Ville quite nicely in terms of both interior room and trunk space - the only thing I miss is the bench front seat (so the dog can sit comfortably between two passengers).  The elevated interior and generous leg and head room make it easy for my severely arthritic husband to get in and out, and there's plenty of room in back when I need to drive my 80-something parents around (anything to keep them from driving!).  

Next - economy.  We love to travel, and I'd rather spend my extra money on airfare and hotel rooms than on a bunch of automotive extras of no real value to me.  My Echo Sedan gets around 35 miles/gallon in the city (with the standard transmission and California emissions system), and I was able to buy it (with CD player, split rear seat, air conditioner, etc.) for under $12,500 by waiting until the end of the model year and using an internet auto shopping service.  In addition, there's enough aging hippie in me that I really believe society has to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels - my NEXT car may be an electric-gas hybrid, but I just couldn't take the 6 month minimum wait to get one, and the Echo is surely the next best thing.

Finally - I love the way it looks.  Yes, it has a European flair - in that it has a &quot;small car for a crowded planet&quot; feel on the outside, and is easy to park in congested areas.  From my perspective, it's certainly &quot;ugly&quot; - or at least funny looking - but not in an unattractive way (much like Dustin Hoffman or Jean Stapleton).  And the center positioning on the instrument panel, while a bit jarring at first, is incredibly easy to live with - I'm fairly short, and in some cars I have to peer through the steering wheel to see what's going on.  Now that I'm used to it, I love the instrument layout.  

I don't think this is the car for everybody - but I think there's a large target audience out there and that Toyota needs to rethink their marketing to attract more of my fellow-fogies.    <br><br>
