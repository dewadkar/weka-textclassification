             While on the market for a used car, I had no clue what I was going to get. I had been to several car dealerships and none had treated me and my family with so much kindness and helpfulness as the Saturn dealer that I went to in Huntington, Long Island. They were so nice and helpful and helped me to pick out the &quot;perfect car.&quot; I currently drive a '94 Saturn SL2, it's a special addition so it is a pearly white color and is fully automatic. 
 This car has been through so much and handled everything wonderfully. It has traction control so it doesn't slip on ice, snow, or rain. It has a sun-roof for those nice beach days, and fully automatic front and rear windows for those drive through windows at McDonald's!! 
 This car was definitely worth the price tag that I paid...I paid in total with taxes and etc. about $10,000. It was a pretty big investment for me, a 17 year old with a part-time job at Old Navy, but it was worth every hard earned penny.
 Saturn owners usually are very happy with their cars, and I am definitely a very happy Saturn owner. They are very safe cars, with dent-proof doors and dual airbags in the front dashboard. I have never had a major problem with my car, but I know that if I ever did that they would be extra-helpful and very speedy on the repair. I am very impressed with Saturn as a company and with the condition of my car...it looks brand new and it is 6 years old already!!
