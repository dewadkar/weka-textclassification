            I just bought my first Jeep, the Wrangler X.  It was a wonderful day!  I absolutely love this vehicle!  I have always wanted a Wrangler, and now I finally own one.

The tough sounding 4.0 really delivers the power and the X has a surprising amount of spunk.  The acceleration is also pretty good, but the low rpm gear shift takes a little getting used to.  Fifth gear is pretty weak on the hills as well.

The sound system is pretty darn good.  The cd player doesn't even skip in the worst potholes (haven't been off-road...yet!)  the overhead soundbar can handle the increased volume required for those top-down days.  The sound is clear and even.  I also think that the joystick fader/balance is kinda cool, though it often gets moved about at the slightest bump.

The soft top is pretty easy to use.  I am 5'2" (and a chic) and I can get the top down by myself with no problems.  Putting the top back up is another story.  The problem lies in that the sail panels are REALLY hard for me to get snapped into place without someone else there to pull the top toward the rear.  Other than that, it is super simple to do.

The X package comes with all of the features I was looking for: cd player, 4.0, soft top with half doors. The surprises came when I discovered that there are tether strap anchors in the trunk for carseats.  (I have a four year old, so that was quite impressive, as he is still in a booster that requires tether lock down.)  Also, the ride isn't as loud as I thought would be with the top up.  The AC and heat work really well (and how awesome is it for a Wrangler to have AC?!?!)  The ride is still kinda bouncy, but that is to be expected.  

The mileage is the only drawback.  This baby really seems to suck down the gas.  Thank goodness it only requires the lowest grade!  I am getting about 16-17 mpg, about a tank+ per week.  

Finally, I mentioned the "Wrangler Society."  I just love being a part of this unspoken Wrangler family.  Almost every Wrangler I meet waves to me on the road or returns my wave.  It's as if we are all of like mind: friendly and fun-loving people.  It's just our nature to wave that wave of acknowledgement.  We just know what a great vehicle we have.
