            We bought a '96 Saturn SL2 new in September '95. This is the second Saturn vehicle we have owned. The first was a '93 SC2 which I very reluctantly surrendered when our first baby was born. I loved the sporty SC2 but decided it wasn't big enough for a family. I was extremely happy with my first Saturn, so I didn't even bother looking at any other brands of car when it came time to choose a bigger car. We went for the SL2 and we've been extremely happy with it.

The Saturn buying experience is refreshingly simple: no haggling over price, something that first time buyers might find reassuring. The cars are a very good value, so even though I wasn't negotiating for a &quot;deal&quot;, I still came away feeling that I wasn't being ripped off. 

My Saturn came with a 5-speed manual transmission, a/c, cassette, power windows and door locks, tilt steering wheel, and cruise control. It also has a nice-sized glovebox, two cupholders, a center console for tapes, and a storage pocket on the back of the passenger seat, as well as bins in the doors for maps. Front airbags for driver and passenger are standard, and the car comes with remote keyless entry, a much-appreciated feature!

The ride is fairly smooth and comfortable and the car handles very well. The steering is responsive and the car hugs corners nicely. Acceleration is decent. The seats are firm but comfortable in front. The rear seat is tight for adults, but fine for kids. Installing an infant car seat may be a little tricky, as the seat is somewhat contoured, but a rolled-up towel or &quot;noodle&quot; will help. Toddler car seats are easy to install. The seatbelt locks up so a locking clip is not needed. The engine is somewhat noisy. I also find the heating and a/c to be fairly noisy when in use. The stereo definitely needs to be cranked up to be heard when the fan is going full blast.

Reliability has been excellent. Other than a minor case of vandalism, and a small bumper dent from a rear-ender, the car has not needed any repairs. Gas mileage is also very good. I drive approximately 1000 miles/month and it seems as though I rarely have to fill the tank. My SC2 was also an extremely reliable car and I definitely feel confident when I am driving a Saturn.

This is an excellent car for someone who wants a sedan that is dependable, inexpensive and fun to drive.
