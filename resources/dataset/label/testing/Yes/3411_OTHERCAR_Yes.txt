            My wife drives her 93 Suburban to work 20 miles 1 way, every day, 5 days a week+.  After work, takes our 3 children to various activities, shops for groceries, and picks up the mail, and is calm and relaxed when done!  She loves the car!  I Like it as well, as I don't have to worry in bad weather when she has to drive in adverse conditions.  Beautiful, powerful and for the size and weight of the unit, economical.  It has a 350 gas motor, automatic overdrive transmission, and all the power trinkets you could ask for.  A soft and quiet ride coupled with a solid sure feel for the road make our trips relaxing and pleasurable.  After 125,000 miles, we still haven't encountered any major problems.  1 radiator leak, 2 sets of tires, and regular fluid changes and this thing will go another 100,000.  The captain chairs really are designed very well and are a plus with the dual arm rests on long trips.  Our children love the rear map lights and have yet to complain about being &quot;seen&quot; riding in it.  We're accustomed to all the compliments and reverence other people give us when we are out and around the neighborhood, which helps our self esteem and desire to keep driving instead of updating.  Really has held good value even with the miles and ware and tare.  Practical yet stylish, any one would feel very happy to own a Chevrolet Suburban, the original, not a facsimile.<br><br>
