                The '99 Mercury Sable is alot of car for not a whole lot of money. With A 7 year old son and a baby on the way, we needed to trade in the old 2 door and get a 4 door. We found what we were looking for in the Mercury Sable. It offers, driver and passenger side air bags, front wheel drive and spacious trunk space. The 6 cylinder fuel injected engine has good acceleration while offering a quiet ride. 
    Our Sable has power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors. The 6 way power seats really help on those long drives especially with the power lumbar support. An AM/FM cassette stereo with CD changer controls provides an excellent sound system.
    The interior has more than adequate leg room for the front and rear passengers. The middle console provides added storage and flips up out of the way. 
    With a 50 mile one way trip to work I would have expected the gas mileage to be better than it is but with that being the only drawback, I am more than pleased with our Sable.
