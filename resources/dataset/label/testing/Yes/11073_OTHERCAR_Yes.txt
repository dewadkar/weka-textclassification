            We have purchased one Audi TT Coupe with the 225 HP twin intercooled 1.8 liter engine coupled to a 6-speed manual box.  Final drive is Audi's Quattro. It is silver with ebony leather interior with Bose sounds and Xenon lights. It came with a nearly worthless navigation system.  This replaces one very troubled 1997 BMW 528i (Quality Ha! review).

By the way, we have determined that TT stands for Terry's Toy (My first name is Terry).

My wife and I shopped around looking at two other potential rides before buying. The Honda 2000, and BMW Z3.  We didn't look at Porsche or Mazda as our rural burg (Lafayette Indiana) doesn't support those vehicles.  

The Honda:  Good looks and great engine sounds.  I am a big (wide) person and found my shoulder pinned against the door panel.  I had trouble with the clutch pedal and basically could not consider it due to the cramped cockpit.  Good looking car though...

The BMW Z3 3.0:  Continues to show me BMW has gone over the hill.  Fit and finish were poor, shifter knob came off in my hand.  I loved the engine and the transmission.  BMW does incorporate the smoothest shifter in the market.  Handling reminded me of my 1988 325is..the good and the bad.  The car just felt powerful and handled like it was on rails.  I just could not get over my last BMW experience.

The Audi:  We started with a 180 HP roadster (with the most incredible interior in any car I have ever seen - looks like a baseball mit) on a snowy day and ended with the 225 HP Quattro.

We live on a ridge near the Walbash and winter is interesting and challenging.  The roadster could not make the hill with front wheel drive while the Quattro did just fine.

The Coupe has several strong points:
- It weighs 200+ pounds less that the roadster
- Has real luggage room 10.8 cubic feet of trunk expandable 18+ by lowering the rear seat.
- Has a nice place to put a brief case.  They call it a real seat but it is restricted to any less that 4'11" and with no legs.  I did not buy this car to carry more than two anyway.
- Gets reasonable mileage (I put my foot in it a lot) 21 in town and 26 on the highway.
- Handles like it is on rails
- I get that good feeling of g's in a turn.
- Precision steering
- Headlights which I have nicknamed - day lights..turns night into day.
- Good shifter, not on the same par as BMW but very acceptable and is truly a short throw shifter.  For those who remember it shifts like an ISO/TVR Griffith. 
- Good pedal location - after driving it for a while, found it to be ideal.  My first impressions of the pedal location was that they were bunched too far to the right and I felt like I was sitting sideways.
- Lots of manual stuff..I would prefer if we eliminate all power options on sports cars but this is 2001.
- Great seats, good support and manually adjustable.
- Very good visibility:  I have owned a number of sports cars and sports coupes/sedans and the TT 

The down side:
- Worthless Navigation system:  Requires 11 disks to cover the US..at a price tag of $180 each.  Takes two disks to cover the state of Indiana. The computer is located in the hatchback thus you have to stop and change disks.  Just don't buy it.
- Poor radio:  Yes, it has a Bose radio with no fader control. Sounds tinny and the AM section sounds better on music than the FM.  CD player hums.  I would not pay the $1,200 for this radio again.
- Very hard to get into and out of.  I suffer with this.  It's a design issue.
- Worthless cup holder although I found a Starbuck's cup which works quite well.

Quality:
- Good not great..clock broke the first time we (the dealer and I) tried to set it during the show and tell during delivery.
- Some minor rattle from the disk player in the so-called back seat arm rest.

Overall impression:
- Fun to drive, grows on me every time I am behind the wheel
- Rides well on trips (unexpected)
- Handles in the wet better than anything I have ever driven
- Love the styling
- Everyone notices it.  It seems to bring smiles to everyone who sees it.  Totally unexpected attention.
- My boss thought I must have struck oil. Impression by most that I spent more money for the TT than I did for the BMW.
- Wish the radio was better
- Great visibility

And the appeal....The other day I picked up my boss and he pointed out a lip print on the passenger's window.  Someone, obviously female (lipstick and shape) had kissed the window.  A first....I love the TT but kiss it???

I am pleased with our decision...

TRY IT - YOU WILL LIKE IT
