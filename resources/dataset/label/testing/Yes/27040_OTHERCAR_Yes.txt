            I was looking for a digital camera with a nice zoom.  I found it with the Olympus D-450.  It has been a while since I have used a decent camera and from the first picture it has taken some incredible pictures.

My wife and I use this camera for everything we do.  Every weekend we try to do something new and the camera has been great for documenting our experiences.  Our families love to read our emails and see the pictures of the past weekends.  At family get-to-gethers it is great to get a picture that you know all the kids look decent in.  Usually one or two are looking off into the distance.  With the wide view LCD it is easy to view the pictures from all angles.

<b>PROS</b>
I love the quality of pictures taken in the dark.  We took it to Mount Rushmore and have pictures of the fireworks flying off of the heads.  It is amazing when the little light of the fireworks can light up the faces.  I have also enjoyed the fast picture taking capabilities.  In the 15 minutes of fireworks I took over 60 pictures.  I had to throw about half away because in the dark the shutter is slow and I don't have a steady hand.

<b>CONS</b>
Unfortunately I have had to buy some &quot;necessary&quot; accessories.  The serial download is very slow.  It also drains the batteries immensely.  I bought a USB SmartMedia reader; it works great!!  I can access my photos as fast as I can my hard drive.  I also bought some NiMH rechargables and they seem to last a long time.

While learning to use my camera, I took a lot of blurry pictures.  It was hard to get used to holding the button half way down before taking a picture.  On the other hand when we use the flash it seems to drown the image out.  Also the lens is incredibly slow.  It is hard to take a quick picture if the camera is off.

<b>SUMMARY</b>
Overall, it is a great camera and when all the accessories are bought it takes great pictures that are easily downloaded.  Image quality is great and the pictures are huge.  I use them as backdrops on my 19 inch monitor.  Our friends love to borrow the camera (they just had a baby.)  They say that it is very easy to use and they love the pictures of ther new son (who wouldn't love their first baby pictures?)<br><br>
