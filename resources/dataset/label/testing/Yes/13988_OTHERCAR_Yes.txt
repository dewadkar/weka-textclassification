            I've had my Honda Accord for 6 years. I bought it used from its only previous owner. Throughout the years, the only problems I have had with it is worn out wipers and flat tires. This car has been on several road trips throughout my college life and has managed to stay perfectly intact. 

I am INCREDIBLY rough on this car. I keep it messy, forget oil changes and usually don't have enough air in my tires. It has survived many dings and knicks and has always pulled through. The seats are, for the most part, quite comfortable. The original speaker system leaves one wanting a bit more. Also, my car has been broken into twice having both driver and passenger windows busted out. I had them replaced, but it seems the motor for both windows is not what it used to be since the break in. 

I don't really have a need for speed, this is just a great car to drive around town and great on road trips. It has ample trunk space and is great on gas mileage. In fact, I used to have a 95 Izuzu Trooper which I got rid of as soon as gas prices went up and got this car, which was so much more affordable. Affordability is definately key when gas is so very ridiculously expensive these days. 

My only complaint is that this car has no panache. Its very boring looking, but not ugly. I have the champagne color of this car, which apparantly is quite popular as I constantly see it out on the road. One time I was at the grocery store and upon walking out to my car, I noticed a huge dent and peeling paint on the back bumper. I started to freak out and look around for other cars bearing my paint color who might have hit it. Then I noticed that there was a t-shirt in the back window that I had never seen before. It turned out that this was not my car at all, but an identical one parked across from my own. I was really embarrassed and hoped that the real owner didn't catch me gauking at his rear bumper. I truly would enjoy a more unique car, but I'm going to stick this one out until it just dies. I'm at 147,000 miles and still trucking.
