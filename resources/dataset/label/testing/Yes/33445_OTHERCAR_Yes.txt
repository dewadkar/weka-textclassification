            In May of 1999 I bought a brand new Jetta GLS.  I have nothing to say about the car other than it is GREAT!  Previous to my new Jetta I have owned Chryslers, Oldsmobiles, an Alfa Romeo, and a BMW.  My Jetta outshines them all.  Its comfortable, stylish, and economical.  The car now comes with a 6 cylinder which would be the only thing about my car I would change.  I couldn't be happier with my car so far.  

I originally bought the vehicle because I loved its design.  The paint quality is unmatched by other auto manufacturers.  The body is very solid and the seats are really nice for a small car.  The backseat folds down giving the large trunk even more space.  I would recommend this car to anyone.
