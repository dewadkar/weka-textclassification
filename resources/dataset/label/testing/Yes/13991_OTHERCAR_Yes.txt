            About 6 years ago, I needed a car to replace my 1986 Camry in order to avoid over $1000 in repairs (the car had about 130,000 miles).  I wanted a manual transmission and anti-lock brakes.  At first, the Toyota dealer was accommodating and tried to order me a DX with ABS and a manual, but they couldn't.  As I explored other options, they became harder to work with.  I finally walked out on them and focused my attention on Honda.

I had owned a 1983 Accord hatchback and had loved it.  The 1995 Accord EX had me impressed. The VTEC engine and manual transmission easily propelled the car to highway speeds (exactly what I needed for commuting).  Plus, it had anti-lock brakes standard.  Thankfully, the dealer was able to find and deliver the car I wanted.

Right now, the car has almost 100,000 miles on it and I am teaching my 16 year-old son on it.  This Honda has been as good as any I have ever owned.  So good, my family bought a Honda Odyssey minivan last spring (see my opinion).  The car still drives and handles with minimal effort.

I have had some complaints.  First, the air conditioning (which was the first of Honda's CFC-free models) robs the engine of power when it's on full-blast (you can notice the change in pickup).  Second, the seat is not designed real well and causes my leg to cramp during extended drives (a piece of foam on the seat has helped somewhat). I wish the car had a 6-way power seat, but it only came with leather seats.  

Reliability has been good, except for one problem.  Last spring, I had my first major repair on this car (over $1000).  I did not realize, however, that one of the items replaced was the clutch.  I have never had a clutch die at 75,000 miles like this one did.  However, one year later, the clutch gave me more trouble.  It had failed again and the warranty had just expired on the part.  Fortunately, the Honda dealer was able to replace it for free. The problem still exists and the dealer can't find anything wrong with the clutch (although someone suggested some "brass rings" in the transmission may be to blame).

Unfortunately, I will not be able to drive this vehicle to 200,000 miles as I had planned.  My son noticed a water leak through a rear seatbelt mechanism a few months ago.  It turns out that when my car was involved in a rear-end collision right after I bought the car, the body shop didn't adequately seal the window.  As a result, water has leaked into the frame and it has began to rust.  I have been told the latest repair done to it will fail within a year from now.  I was not expecting to replace that car so soon.
