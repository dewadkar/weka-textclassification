            <b>Overview</b>
I had previously owned a 1995 Mercedes SL320 and got the 2002 SC430 in December 2001.  Since then of course, Mercedes has upped the ante (and price) with their new SL, and Cadillac has come out with the XLR.  For value for money, there is no comparison, the <b>Lexus wins easily</b>.  The SC430 is the least sporty of the three, but by no means is a slow car. If you want pure speed, well, you would go with a Viper or tuned Corvette probably.  The Lexus is a compromise, somewhat like the old SL, it isn't the fastest, quietest, smoothest or for that matter anything 'est.  It is highly refined, very quiet, very smooth, has a great layout, is comfortable, and has great pickup speed that will meet the needs of most people.  If you are looking for a refined, trouble-free hardtop convertible, Lexus puts out a great product at $10k-$30k less than the competition.

<b>Performance</b>
This is the biggest area Lexus will have to work on, just like the old SL it feels as if there are a few too many compromises in the performance department.  You can feel the engine wanting to let loose, but without Triptronic and better ride handling the engine and therefore performance is held back a bit.  Not that this is a slow car by any imagination, 95%  of people will find that it more than meets their needs.  Going from 65-85 is smooth and pretty quick.  You get the feeling that if there was a manual option this car would rock with the stock 4.3L engine, but alas the somewhat tame automatic keeps it civilized.  Cornering and overall ride handling is somewhat soft and unresponsive, Lexus chose to provide a smooth ride rather than a sporty one.  That being said, it is still a low-to-the-ground sports car, so the ride isn't as smooth as say the LS, but for a convertible it is pretty amazing.  Overall I would say two modifications would make all the difference;
1. Add triptronic (or similar technology for manual shifts)
2. Provide variable ride suspension (ala Corvette or XLR)

<b>Convenience & Comfort</b>
This is one of the main reasons I went with the SC430, and previously with the SL320.  The SC430 has a great trunk, I can go grocery shopping, goto the beach, etc. with the top down.  You have to get the runflat tires, otherwise there is no space, but then most people will want them for the safety anyway.  The 'back seat' which I am told was mainly put their for insurance purposes and designed to hold golf bags is useless for passengers above 12yrs old, but is great for storage. It is the only hardtop convertible that I know of that is really useful as an every day car.  The new SL is more like a beefed up SLK, and the Cadillac appears to be barely any better.  The SC430 actually has cupholders, although relatively poorly designed, it is still better than none at all.  The seats are 10x better than my old SL, although the new SL has made great strides also.  The DVD system is pretty good and highly useful and the stereo beats the hell out of the Bose.  The AC (used a lot here in FL) is pretty good, but could use two sets of controls. A couple of things they could do better;
1. Better cupholders
2. Cooled seats or an option for different seating material in hot climates.  Yes the leather is comfy, but think of something like the Herman Miller Aeron, airy, yet comfy.
3. DVD with traffic updates, etc. (subscription revenue!!)
4. Satellite (XM or Sirrius)
5. Better car info center, there is the DVD monitor, use it to show individual tire pressures, etc.
6. Individual settings for fan speed and settings (which fans are on) would be nice.

<b>Safety</b>
The car weighs in at 3840lbs, which affects its performance, but presumably would help in an accident.  The car has a very solid feel, like all Lexus vehicles the doors sound/feel solid, nothing feels cheap.  The main gripe I have is that the rear rollbar (integrated into the headrests) is a little too low and may not provide full protection to the front seat occupants.  Of course I have always felt that the best safety is to avoid an accident.  The Lexus lags a little in responsiveness, but is nimble enough and responsive enough to get you out of most situations.  The braking is superb, but they really screwed up with the amount of pull the braking can generate.  One major flaw they have is that on uneven pavement, the car can really pull.  According to the dealer all SC430s exhibit this behavior and it is due to the suspension and runflat tires.  You have to keep a tight grip on the steering wheel when braking!  Some things they could do better;
1. Better rollover protection
2. Better braking/ride on uneven surfaces

<b>Reliability</b>
No problems so far, for a brand new model it is practically unheard of.  There have been two factory recalls in 21 months, both very minor.  I get the feeling that this car could easily last 150k  miles.  The old SL was a pile of dung comparatively and Mercedes service is very spotty.  Lexus service so far has been very good, although they could do some little things better (like updating the service info in the book and on the computer). One of the problems I have is due to the low riding nature of the SC430; the underside is cracked near the front bumper and due to a poor design would require that the entire front bumper be replaced.  The other problem is that they were doing some roadwork near me and there was a 6"  gap between the road and a manhole cover.  I believe it actually caused one of the rims to become bent and I will have to replace it here shortly.  This isn't Lexus' fault, it is one of the downsides of a low riding sports car; you can't risk going directly over it and tearing up the underside.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
I would recommend covering the rear seats so as not to damage the leather, noone can really sit there anyway.  I got the rear seats covered in matching vinyl for about $150.  I will take it in shortly to remove it for a couple of days to air out the leather.
The top could be a little faster (I think the 2003 or 2004 made improvements, maybe it can be retrofitted!)
I would love the ability to remotely lower/raise the roof
The style still gets quite a few looks, especially when raising/lowering the roof
