            I recently had the chance to drive a 1999 Nissan Maxima for a few days. I needed a rental car because my own car was in the shop. I almost rented something less expensive but I'm glad I didn't because I really enjoyed the Maxima.

Let me begin by telling you what you will not find in my review. If you want to know how this car performs when pushed to its limits on the racetrack, look elsewhere. My experience with it did not include determining the car's top speed or quickest possible 0-60mph time. I also can't say anything about the long term reliability of the car, since I only rented it for a few days. I just want to share my impressions after driving it a few days under normal day to day use.

The first thing I noticed about driving the Maxima was the engine. I remember Nissan's advertisements claiming it's the best V-6 in America (I don't remember the exact words, but something like that), and I thought okay we'll see about that. After only a few minutes behind the wheel I was convinced there would be no reason to accuse Nissan of false advertising. It really is a great engine! It has plenty of power, even at low engine speed. It revs smoothly and quietly without any harshness or hesitation.

Another one of the Maxima's strong points is it's brakes. The brake pedal is very firm but sensitive, not squishy. Very little pressure is required to operate the pedal, but the brakes feel precise. The brakes also have excellent grip, which inspires confidence in the car's ability to stop quickly. If anything the brakes are perhaps a bit too sensitive. Several times I brought the car to a halt faster than I had intended to. If you are used to "squishy" brakes, the ones on a Maxima may take some getting used to, but I quickly came to appreciate them.

The Maxima has a nice solid feel, giving the impression that it was engineered and assembled with great care and attention to detail. The interior was comfortable. My particular car had cloth interior, not leather, but the cloth met with my approval. All controls were intuitive and within easy reach. My only gripe about the interior is its size. After adjusting the driver's seat to my liking, I looked at the back seat and there appeared to be hardly any more space than the back seat of my Integra. My Integra is a 4-door but still I expected the Maxima to be considerably larger inside.

In terms how the car drove, I have only one complaint, and that is the automatic transmission. The automatic is way too eager to upshift, and does so prematurely. This problem is only magnified by the unusually high gear ratios. This means that once you get going, the car shifts into a high gear, the revs go way down, and the engine, as good as it is, has no power under those conditions. I would drive down the road at 40mph (or less), and the car would already be in top gear. Then if I wanted to accelerate to 42mph, the car would downshift. Even the very slightest tap on the gas pedal would result in a downshift. Then when I reached 42mph it would upshift again. Traveling even at near constant speed involved constant upshifts and downshifts from the automatic. The transmission was a smooth shifter, but even its gentle nudge became annoying after a while. I would gladly sacrifice one or two mpg to have a transmission with gutsier gear ratios and less tendency to upshift prematurely.

The Maxima is available with a 5-speed manual, and that would definitely be the transmission I would choose. However, you will have a hard time finding one. I was so impressed with the Maxima's good qualities that I recommended it to a friend of mine who was looking for a new car. So we went to the local Nissan dealer and asked for a Maxima with the 5-speed manual. The dealer had some 30 Maximas on hand, but not a single one had the 5-speed, and the dealer was not optimistic about finding one anywhere. I came to the conclusion that Nissan only "offers" the manual (on about 3% of Maximas, if that) so that its advertisements can claim it can go from 0-60mph in 7.1 seconds.

The trip to the dealer also brings up my other complaint: the price. I was under the impression that a Maxima cost roughly $24,000 - $28,000. Wrong! The cheapest one they had at the dealer was about $28,000 with many of them costing well over $30,000. Perhaps it was just this particular dealer but that puts the Maxima in same price range as some stiff competition like the Acura TL and Lexus IS300. Those cars have a higher list price, but I know you can actually get a well equipped Acura TL for $30,000. As good as the Maxima is, there are many other great cars out there and I am not sure the Maxima is worth what it costs to actually get one (at least at the dealership I went to).

Lastly, I would like to talk about the Maxima's performance. Rather than trying to think of words to describe it I will just give an example. I was driving down the onramp to the freeway on the way to work. About half way down the ramp a big 18-wheeler came into view and I saw that at my current rate of acceleration we were on a collision course. I thought the best thing to do would be to get ahead of the truck and then merge. Time to see what this car can do! As usual, the car was already in top gear. I gradually but steadily pressed the gas pedal and here is what happened: I thought gas pedal meant go (before downshifting the car didn't pick up at all)..... first downshift..... okay now we're going but I think we need a little more to get safely in front of that truck..... second downshift..... RRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM!! The V-6 under the hood let out a satisfying growl as the tachometer crept up to about 4500rpm (still some 2000rpm shy of redline). After the second downshift the car had more than enough power to launch me safely on to the freeway a comfortable distance in front of the truck.

In summary, I very much enjoyed those couple of days with the Maxima. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sports sedan (and does not mind if it's a bit on the small side). If only it had a better transmission and didn't cost so much I would upgrade my opinion from very good to truly outstanding.
