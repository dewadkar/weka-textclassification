            I recently purchased the following vehicle:

Ford XLS 2002 4DR Explorer.

Ford has updated thier most popular SUV.  The NEW Explorer has a ton of extras to offer Standard.

4.0L V6 210HP
4 wheel disc/anti-lock brakes
Power windows/doors
AM/FM/Cass(spend $50 and get the single CD)
driver and passenger side airbags
A/C
rear window defogger/wiper
rear independent suspension (More on that later!!)

RIDE

I drove three SUV's out there.  Toyota Highlander, Chevy Yukon, and this one.  All "handled" well, BUT the Ford was the most quiet.  I honestly have NEVER driven a "truck" that had a smoother ride and handles as well, Any bumps you would normally feel are absorbed by The new independent suspension and it is REALLY a plus in this!

Comfort

The standard A/C is OK.  If you want to hurry up warming and cooling your friends, then get the XLT package ($2000 easy).  The standard A/C WILL work, but you will need to give it time. The standard front and middle row seats are comfortable enough, and all the gauges are easy to read with the green by white lighting.

Power

Here is where parts actually PART.  The standard engine for the Explorer is a 4.0L V6 at 210HP.  The total amount you may tow is 2400lbs.  If you decide to up the engine to the V8, then you can tow up to 4000lbs.  The only reason to upgrade, is the tow package, and the V8 is quieter, but at a $3000 premium.....you decide.  Ford does not allow customer to opt for a V8 instead of the V6;  Unless you want to spend MORE on another "package"?

Mileage

OK.  This is where the new Explorer SUCKS.  I do not care what engine you have;  You will only get 15MPG MAX on the street, and 20MPG on trips.  This vehicle is a fish and be prepared to pay for it!!
