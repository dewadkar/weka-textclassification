            I obtained a 1990 Grand Am LE for my first car. I got it for $750 from a friend who needed cash bad. I can honestly say it is one of the best purchases of my life. It had 116,000 miles on it and drove beautifully during my whole ownership.  It is sporty and fun to drive.  

The only problem I had with it was rough starting.  Im not sure if the starter was going or what but it never failed to start.  I believe it had a 2.5 litre 4 cylinder with 110 horsepower.  While being a reliable engine it lacked the power and spunk a teen driver demands!  Although it did help me get my first speeding ticket ;-) The 3 speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly and without hesitation.  It tended to shake at highway speeds though. Also I found the lack of aftermarket accessories and performance parts disappointing.  But none the less it is quite a good car.

Im not sure how it handles winters seeming as how it was demolished in a rearend crash by a 1/4 ton Chevy pick-up truck.  The paramedics did say that the seatbelts were the only thing preventing us from laying on my hood.  So I think its safe to say it is a safe car as well.
