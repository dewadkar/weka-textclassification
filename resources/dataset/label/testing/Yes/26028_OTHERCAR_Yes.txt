            Hello, we owned this vehicle for 2 years or so.  Let me start by saying this is a TRUE SUV.  it was not intended to get good gas mileage or take turns like a car.  Before proceeding with my essay understand what this vehicle is designed for. And Before i go and praise this Range Rover let me take you the reader through the problems we encountered while we owned it.

First off the ARS air suspension is the coolest thing ever invented for the SUV.  Unfortunetly for us the ARS is still relatively new in the 1995 Rangie models.  It did have problems and was very costly to fix.  We eventually converted ours to the classic Coil ride and suffered no more problems.  

Secondly, the electronics are very temperamental.  They have to be worked on by a Rover dealership or someone who knows their range rovers  -or else..-  We had no problems with electrics except for interior lights not working every now and then and the driveside seat not adjusting except when the door was open.  Yes, interesting..  No major electrical problems though.  

Now on to the praise, This vehicle performed like no other when called to serve our family.  It hauled heavy loads, carried our family on long trips, did work around the farm, and the list goes on.  No complaints whatsoever when you get down to the nitty gritty work and utility as well as creature comforts.  

Mechanically very sound.  The 4.2L V8 offers more power than the earlier model's 3.9L and offers better gas mileage.  A very fun vehicle to drive up and down the road as well as very comfortable. 

I will admit that the buttons and controls take a bit to get used to, but hey its all part of the Land Rover experience.. heh.  

As an example of the power this vehicle packs, this last summer we were working on a house way up in the mountains and had a load of gravel being dumped by a dump truck.  the DTruck couldn't get up the driveway as the load was too heavy and the incline was too steep.  The driver of the truck estimated it to be about 20-30 tons in weight.  We offered to give him a tow with the Rangie, he laughed at us but said "sure why not."  Lo-and-behold! the vehicle assisted the dump truck up the hill with little effort much to the driver's amazement.  He then asked us with wonder in his eyes, "what is that thing?"

A most excellent vehicle to own and drive.  It does cost deep in the pocket for repairs so do be prepared if something were to go wrong on it.  We were never in the shop for anything major though so no worries..  treat the vehicle like an SUV and not a car and your life will be trouble free.
