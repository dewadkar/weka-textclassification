            This car is a wonderful sports car especially the GS-R with 170 horse and a nice brisk 8000 redline....definatly go for the 5 speed.....its smooth and responsive......and this cars got looks to go with it both 3rd generation and 2nd. This car can be modified a lot and is awesome on fuel....it handles amazingly and for the money you cannot buy a better vehicle. A great vehicle for the serious driver who loves the feel of the road in his hands and the whirr of a wonderfully sounding engine in his ears.<br><br>
