            The 1995 mazda millenia is an incredible car. It has speed, handling, and luxury all combined into one car. The 2.5 liter V-6 supplys more than enough power to get the car up to speed and you can turn and stop on a dime if needed. The space inside is ample considering I am 6'1&quot; I need some leg room and I do not even have to put the seat all the way back to supply enough room to be comfortable. I absolutly love the styling of the car. The inside has an extremely sharp black dash with some wood paneling and then tan leather. All of the instruments are placed in clear view and easy to get to. The only downside is the cup holder. The way it is placed makes it impossible to get to the cd player when u have a tall glass in the cupholder, although it does slide into the dash and out of the way when not in use. To drive this vehicle to like to be driving on clouds, literally. It is the smoothest car ive ever ridden in, even at speeds of 80-90 miles an hour it is smooth as can be, not even a shudder. anyone who wants a nice vehicle should buy this car. It is incredible and a great buy. I bought mine for 8,000 dollars and it has 77,000 miles on it and it still rides like none other.<br><br>
