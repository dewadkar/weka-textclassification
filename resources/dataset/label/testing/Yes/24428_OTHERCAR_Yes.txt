            I picked up this digital camera a few months after it
first came out and must say that I am extremely satisfied
with my purchase.  Much of my satisfaction comes from the
benefits of digital photography over traditional 35mm,
however.  You are probably more interested in how it compares with other digital cameras, and that is what I will try to address here.

After conducting an extensive review of consumer opinions on digital cameras in this price range, I settled on two choices:  the Canon Powershot S100 and the Sony DSC-S50.  Since my roommate got the S100 and I got the DSC-S50, I've been able to compare the two side by side over a long period of use.  My conclusions?  On pure image quality, the S100 edges out the Sony.  But, on the basis of features and ease of use, the Sony wins out.  

The Sony has some trouble focusing in a dark room.  Often I
was forced to turn up the lights in order to kick in the autofocus.  The Canon has a nice assist lamp that helps the camera find its focus even in a dark room.  This alone may explain why the Sony's indoor pictures may end up slightly soft compared to the Canon.  One way to get around this is to use manual focus mode and gauge the length of the camera to the subject- not convenient.  Of course, these points are moot when outdoors in bright conditions.  

The features and ease of use are Sony's feather-in-the-cap. I love the user interface and find navigating the menus very easy.  There *are* some obscure options like white balance and sharpness that you probably won't fiddle with too much and will probably want to read the manual before adjusting.  But the common features are really accessible.  There's even a nifty 'hot key' that will allow you to immediately inspect (and choose to delete) a photo you've just taken.  The video feature is a really nice bonus which the Canon Elph does *not* have.  You can take low resolution videos of up to 60 seconds long, and the camera has a nice built in microphone and speaker for playing back.  I've even used the DSC-S50 to record soundbytes at concerts and stuff.

The LCD screen on the Sony is *much* better than the one on the Canon!  The flip out screen is also a nice feature that allows you to compose and shoot pictures of yourself.

Compactness is a plus for the Canon.  THe Sony isn't that big, but it has a zoom lens that sticks out just enough that it would only fit in a big pocket.  But that comes with a benefit: the Sony has a wider zoom and can focus to a closer distances (using the macro feature) than the Canon.
Not a biggie for me.

Between these two great digital cameras, you really can't go wrong.  I settled on the Sony because I like the option of shooting videos and the superior screen.  People have criticized the lack of a viewfinder.  That hasn't really bothered me that much.
