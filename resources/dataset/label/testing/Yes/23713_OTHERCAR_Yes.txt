            I bought my 1992 Saturn SC in April, 1997.  I bought it from a used Saturn dealership, in Fairfax Circle, VA.  I decided on the Saturn after careful consideration.  In 1994, my girlfriend (at the time) and I were involved in a roll-over accident, which totaled her car (a Mercury Tracer, which didn't fair well, but that's another epinion).  We both poured over piles and piles of dealership offering, and most importantly, Consumer Reports.  At the time, Saturn (which is a subsidiary of GM) was rated top in customer satisfaction.  After, approximately a month, she decided on a Saturn SL (the basic sedan).  She was so happy with it, that in 1997, when I was in the market for a new car, I also looked very carefully at Saturn.  At the same time, my younger sister, also bought a used Saturn.  I finally decided on a nice, 1992 Saturn SC, teal in color.  I have never regretted the decision since.  I bought the car with 52,000....it now has 96,700 miles, and is still going strong.  A new dealership opened near my new home, and I know where I will buy my next, new car! <br>Buying a Saturn is so easy! You know, that if you go to a Ford dealership in Maryland, you might get a better deal on another Ford in rural North Carolina.  But if you go to two different Saturn Dealerships, you know that you will get the same price.  This may seem like a disadvantage, but that means that the car will hold a better resale value, later.<br><br>However, Saturn is not without it's downsides, too.  Unless you opt for the new, larger sedans, you are stuck with a four cylinder engine (1.9L), which will only get you 124 hp +/-.  But, since it has a small engine, fuel economy is best in it's class (I get 37 MPG on the highway, try that with a similar car!)  I would also like to see better interior trim, but then again, I busted that myself.  The older models tend to burn oil, quickly....keep an eye on it.  Oh, and when it rains, my trunk lid leaks when it is opened.  But I think a lot of these small flaws should have been fixed by now.  There is some minor road noise, but I've driven the newer models, and just about all road noise has been eliminated.  Back seat is cramped, but, it is coupe (however, I did fit six people in to it, including myself)<br><br>In all, if you are in the market for a new/used car, visit your local Saturn dealership, or www.saturn.com  you might be surprised.<br><br><br>
