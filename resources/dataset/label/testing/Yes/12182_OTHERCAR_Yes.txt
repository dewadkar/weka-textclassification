            Ok, I admit it... I have that disease that makes me want to buy jeeps. Sure, they are unreliable, impractical and inefficient, but there is an undeniable draw to them. My fourth jeep is a bone stock four cyl. painted "Moab colored" amber fire. It is a second vehicle and is used mostly as a toy. Right after I bought the jeep I ditched the stock tires (I sold them to a Geo Metro owner) in favor of 31s. My biggest complaint with the jeep is that it's insanely gutless on the highway. I put in a K&N filter to help with the power but I still cant get over 75 mph on the highway. Smaller tires would be the obvious solution, but come on, it's a jeep. The ride is choppy and uncomfortable on the highway and you can plan on being sore after a long trip. I'm glad I didn't order a radio with the jeep because I doubt I could hear it with all the wind noise at freeway speeds.

  Drive off road, however and suddenly the jeep becomes a whole new breed of animal. That litte ride will go almost anywhere. Most people will tell you to run away screaming if someone trys to sell you a pre-2003 Wranger with a 4-banger but I'm here to tell you that it is better that the six off road in a stock rig. I used to have a '97 Wrangler with a six and I would run out of revs on steep hills in 4 high.  Now I walk right up the same hills without having to switch to 4 low. The 4.11 gears in the four banger are great and the little engine provides a lot grunt at low speeds. If you want big tires or spend most of your time on the road buy a six cyl, but remember, there's a reason why the first jeeps had fours.

  So what does it all mean? Don't buy a jeep if you just want to be "cool" while you drive around the concrete jungle. Image just isn't worth the pain. Be good to your jeep and let it live free in the wild, where it belongs.
