            I my name is Gaetan and i use to hown a mustang 1989 hatchback fully loaded,4 cyl. manuel transmission,sinnce i live in the province of Quebec i use to drive my car even in the winter,but unfortunately i had to get rid of it because it was'nt taken care of properly since i did not have a lot of money i had to by a car for my need not for the fun of it (Cavalier 1997) but in the summer i trade my boat for a dream car,i always said that i was going to get another MUSTANG so i got a beautifull 2000, 3.8 li. black convertible, manuel transmission fully loaded.

Driving this car is an incredible expï¿½rience,the power for that engine is very very good,the car handled very well

The price is really good compare to other convertible.

I would'nt say that it is a famely car but i am 43 and i have 2 kid and they say that the car is confortable,and they love the convertible,and it is a hell of an eyes catcher <br><br>
