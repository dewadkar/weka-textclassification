            I purchased this 1999 BMW 323ic convertible because I have owned two other BMW's. Presently own a 1988 325ic convertible and owned a 325 coupe for 14 years, 1986.

I love the vehicle because it is reliable, sturdy and the value holds up over the years. I sold my 1986 325 coupe for $3,500 with 237,000 miles in Feb., 2000. It is still tight, quiet and runs very well.

It is the &quot;Ultimate Diving Machine&quot;, it handles very smoothly, corners with out much sway and has great acceleration. Purchasers of the 323ic should be ones that want great value. A car that will last for a number of years. Will hold up in styling, and durability.<br><br>
