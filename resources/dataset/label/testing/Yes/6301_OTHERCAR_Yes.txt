            The 1996 Dodge Avenger was my first car, and I will always have some affection for it.  I bought it at a deal price of $11,000 in 1999 with 38,000 miles on it.  The Odometer now reads 52,000, but the car is still great.  First off, the Avenger is a visually appealing car, it looks sleek and stealthy, especially with a spoiler.  The car rides low to the ground, so the driver always possesses that felling of power on the road.  

The alloy wheels are nice looking, and all the automated systems, from the locks, to the windows, and cruise control I have never had a single problem with.  The Avenger has always started from temperatures over 100 degrees to temperatures below 10 degrees.  The engine always starts strong and has yet to make any strange or alarming noises.  

For a car of its size, the Avenger has incredible space.  The driver has great leg room as does the passenger.  I am six foot one inch and I have head room to spare in my Avenger.  The trunk is the most impressive space wise, however.  I have fit luggage for two people packed for a week and a half and filled about 3/4 of the trunk.  It has more than enough room for most anything the average person would need to carry.  Another nice feature of the trunk is the back seats fold down for easy access on the road.  That way you can stow maps, CD's or other necessities in the trunk without cluttering the car.  

The avenger handles like a dream.  It can take curves very quickly and has modest acceleration.  I personally have timed my Avenger at 0-60 in about 9 seconds.  I have never gone for a max-out speed, but I have traveled over 115 in it with no problem at all.  The acceleration is steady.  

Some of the negatives to this wonderful car are the windows.  Through constant shutting of the doors by the windows, they can become loose and even flop around a bit.  It has not caused me any leaks or a serious problem at all, but I could foresee something minor down the road.  Another small problem is the fact that the Avenger is so low to the ground that sometimes in parking the bottom of the front end (made of plastic) will scrap the concrete parking slab.  Sometimes it gets caught and makes me nervous when I have to gas the car to pull it off the concrete, but nothing serious has ever happened, the bottom of the plastic is just scraped.  Nothing the onlooker can see though.  One last thing I have been somewhat dissatisfied with is the tires.  I recently had to have a flat tire replaced and to my dismay discovered that the Avenger tires are quite expensive.  They range in about $150+ per tire because they are short and wide.  

Overall this is a great car.  It has never let me down and I don't expect it ever will.  I have traveled long distances with it with no problem at all (400 miles in one stretch) and I know I could keep going.  For the small trouble I have had, my love for it's good features outweigh.
