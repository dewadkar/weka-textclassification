               The HP Photosmart 812 Digital Camera in my opinion is one of the best digital cameras on the market today. The camera fits very comfortably in your hand with all the buttons in exactly the right spot for easy use. The software included is so easy to use, yet is loaded with every feature imaginable.

   The camera has 4.13 MP resolution with 30 bit color, more then enough resolution for a excellent 8 x 10 photograph.
   
   The view finder is the point and shoot type with a pentax lens. 1.5 inch LCD color display for viewing the pictures you have taken and the picture you are about to take. 3x optical zoom and 18x digital zoom making a total of 21x zoom. The zoom is powerful enough for almost all needs, except maybe far zooming in close of scenery. 12 to 1/2000 second shutter speed.

   The HP Photosmart 812 Digital Camera has 3 shooting modes single shoot, timer mode and movie mode. The movie mode is great for filming short video.

   The camera is connected through you computers usb port. The transfer speed is very quick compared to other digital cameras i have tried. A 16 mb memory card is included in the box along with 2 batteries, the usb cable, instruction book and software ( HP Photo & Imaging Software, Arcsoft Photo Fantasy and photo imaging software for MAC).

   The camera dock (not included) makes transfering pictures to your computer super fast. All you have to do is plug it in a push a single button and the pictures are automatically transfered to wherever you have the software set to transfer the pictures to.

   I would highly recommend this camera to everyone from someone getting their first digital camera to someone that needs a digital camera for professional use. It is so easy to use children could use it, but has all the features a professional would want. A 1 year warranty is included.
