            After trying to drive over south Dakota's drifts one winter, i traded my sport car for a Jeep Cherokee. The snow stopped! NO drifts since that fateful September. My son-in- law warned me this  would happen. But  thois is still a great ride/ Roomy and capable of handling wet and rough conditons(we have had rain and ice) the Jeep does all that is asked of it and more and for a car illiterate 50+ divorcee this is a PLUS! There was one small problem while it was under warranty and it was a no problem as far as service was concerned. the nearest dealer ( not the one I had  purchased my model at) was polite and efficent. If this unit performs in endurance and performace as some of the older models that are still running, I will be a happy senior citizen.<br><br>
