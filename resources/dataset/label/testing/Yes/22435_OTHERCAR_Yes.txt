            Since purchasing the Optio S about 4 months ago, I've taken over 1000 pictures with it. In some instances it's taken some very impressive pictures, in other situations it's fallen short. 

The camera is good at taking pictures when there is plenty of light, but when forced to rely on the underpowered built-in flash, problems arise. The flash is unable to provide adequate lighting on subjects that are more than 7 or 8 feet away. When at wide angle the light from the flash is not distributed evenly across the lens range and creates an unnatural light pattern in the picture.

Battery reserve is excellent. The only downside is that the battery has to be removed from the camera and placed in an external charger in order to recharge it.

Occasionally I run into auto-focus issues where the camera will not focus when I think it should be able to. Usually, a few more attempts at focusing will yield successful auto-focus, but sometimes the delay makes me miss the shot I was after.

The camera has two different macro settings, both work well and can provide very short minimum focus distance between the camera and the subject.

Overall, this camera can't be beat for it's size and convenience, but don't expect the underpowered flash to provide adequate lighting, especially if your subject is more than 7 or 8 feet away or if you are at wide angle.
