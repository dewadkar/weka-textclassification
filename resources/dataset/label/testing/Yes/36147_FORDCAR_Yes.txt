            If you're like me, you probably work in the Internet field, make descent money, but don't have descent credit.  However, you still want a good new car to replace your old clunker.  If this is the case, I highly recommend the new Ford Focus.  

The car itself is a lot of fun.  My model is the 4 door straight back, which I think is the most attractive model and a lot better looking than the hatch back.  I also have a standard, which makes the car really zippy.  The car's maneuverability and relatively small size makes it great for aggressive/insane drivers, like myself, and I've been able to perform some really neat (and if I may say so, brilliant) driving tricks in traffic using this car.  The color is a nifty metallic blue and has a really neat set of headlights which add to the very attractive design.  The car's interior is also very comfortable and roomy, and is perfect for bringing your friends or family out on a nice road trip.  

The car is targeted for young people, also like myself, and comes with some neat extra packages you can buy for your lifestyle.  There's a package with a picnic package if you like to hike.  Or one with a dashboard candy dispenser and cooler that plugs into your cigarette lighter.  Another one has magnetic decals of various things (60's retro, ocean life, etc.) that you can put on your car to give it more personality without permanently altering your car.  Another neat feature:  car magnetic poetry.  Ford sent me a free nifty G-Shock watch and a picture frame that I can put on my dashboard with velcro, all for free.  I thought it was a neat touch.  I recommend this vehicle - it's pretty neat.

As I said in the title, this should be your first new car.  The reason being that the car is an excellent buy, very reasonably priced, and Ford Credit has an excellent first-time buyer plan with a low interest rate and a very forgiving credit check.  The payments are also very reasonable, and the insurance isn't bad either.  You should give them a try, you may be surprised.  Good luck!<br><br>
