                 My wife and I decided to buy this vehicle because we wanted to have a large four door vehicle, that could fit our whole family, and have the advantage of a truck bed. When we saw the Sport Trac we loved the design. The sporty exterior and the comfortable interior really appealed to us. It was a real eye pleaser.
     What I really love about this vehicle is that both of my kids can sit very comfortably in the back seat with plenty of room between them. The truck bed isn't too big, so my wife doesn't have any problems backing up. But it is big enough to haul around items that we need such as the kids bikes or luggage.
     To drive this vehicle is a real pleasure. The seats are comfortable, and the ride is smooth. Steering this vehicle is no problem at all. And it has plenty of power.
     Anyone can buy this vehicle. If you are afraid of large vehicles, don't worry. If my wife can drive it than you can. If you have small children , I would recommend that you buy running boards. it is kind of difficult for them to enter the vehicle without them. <br><br>
