            Some cars Drive like Trucks, some drive like a piece of junk. Mercedes Benz cars drive like Jets!

There is absolutely nothing I have driven that has been more comfortable than the Mercedes E class vehicles. Smooth, classy, Comfortable, roomy, and sophisticated aren't enough to describe this street prowler. With the beauty, and bite to back up anything, the E-class Benz has it all. The superior interior/exterior, rims and sound system are worthy of the price.  

The interior has the awesome look to support the beauty of it's exterior. The car accelerates slow at speeds under 25 mph, but as soon as you punch it, it delivers the take off speed that will give you the win in both long and short distances. This is a luxury car, but unlike most of the other brands, this has the power and speed to outrun the best of them.
has plenty of room in the back for the family. Also, this car looks great pulling up to a nice restaurant or a special event.  

If you are still skeptical, look around or better yet, take it for a test drive...It really does accelerate awesome.
