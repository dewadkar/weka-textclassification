               The little advertised Mitsubishi sedan is one of the best kept secrets that Mitsubishi has to offer.  With it's competitors being the Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30, Cadillac Catera, and Mazda Millienia, it stands out in many respects.

   One of the best reasons to buy this vehicle is that it is so rare.  You will be glanced upon because people will wonder what car you are driving.  With a slight resemblance with the old BMW 7 Series, it is a very elegant and refined car to look at.

   The car offers the most horsepower in its class, the car offers a 3.5 Liter V6 that is the same one shared by the Montero SUV.  This powerhouse offers fast and smooth acceleration that makes passing an enjoyable task.

   Other touch ups include memory power seats that can record up to 2 settings, a built in child seat on the back, steering mounted stereo control, and an extra 12V power source located in front of the center console.

   Along with these amenities comes an enormous trunk and a full size spare tire.  6 Speaker Stereo system is standard, and so are 16 inch wheels.

  Everything sounds good so far right?  The downside to this sedan is the inexperience with luxury cars that Mitsubishi lacks.  So you might find a lot of the car is copied from popular luxury cars such as Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus.  Also, it appears that this is on the brinks of discountinuation.  So you better go find your at your local dealer and test drive one quickly.  It's a pity that Mitsubishi doesn't advertise this sedan more.
