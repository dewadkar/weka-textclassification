            Our family has owned our 2001 Avalon XLS for two months now and we really love it.  We bought the car as a replacement for our two-door 1995 Monte Carlo, which is a good car, but not ideal for our growing family since rear-seat access is difficult.  With a baby on the way, we needed a safe, reliable, four-door sedan that was roomy enough for baby and family.  We looked at the Nissan Maxima, Honda Accord and Acura TL.  The Avalon was far and away our favorite.  We purchased a 2001 Toyota Avalon XLS with option package #7, moonroof, VCS and floor mats.  The car has a beige exterior and an ivory leather interior.

Note that the Avalon is based on the Camry platform.  It shares many of the same mechanical components but is longer, wider and taller than the Camry.


EXTERIOR
I find the Avalon exterior handsome.  The car resembles the Lexus GS series in many ways.  The Avalon is a very large car on the inside but the exterior dimensions are small which is a big plus when parking in small spaces.  In fact, the Avalon is only slightly larger on the outside than an Accord yet it is much roomier inside.

The paint is top quality with an excellent finish.  Our car arrived with no sample defects on the exterior.  In two months of driving in a city full of potholes, I haven�t experienced any paint chipping.

The Avalon XLS comes equipped with fog lamps as well as heated outside mirrors.  The outside mirrors are not �break-away� as in most other cars so they are susceptible to damage, especially in the city.

With our option package, our Avalon came with handsome 16-inch aluminum wheels rather than the standard 15-inch wheels.  The tires are the excellent Michelin MVX which give an outstanding ride and are a premium tire � just what I expect Toyota to equip their flagship sedan with.  There is also a full-sized spare in the trunk � a nice touch and a welcome change from the �donut� spare tires in the majority of cars.

A remote keyless entry system is also standard on the XLS.  The driver�s door and/or the passenger doors can be opened with the remote as well as the trunk.  However, to open the trunk, you have to hold the button for a second or two � a bit of a pain.  The keys contain a computer chip in order to start the car � a security feature that reduces the risk of theft and lowers insurance costs.


INTERIOR
The interior is spacious, functional, luxurious and comfortable with many thoughtful touches.  The dash slopes way from the driver and passenger and it resembles previous Buick designs.  It does take getting used to but I like it since it makes the front seat area seem much larger.  The slope-away design does make it difficult to use the multi-functional display since a long reach is required.  I�ve also found that the gauges will reflect on the windshield at night, which is mildly annoying.  I understand that there is Toyota service bulletin for this problem as well as  fix, which I will request when I bring my Avalon in for servicing (I haven�t has the need to bring my car for servicing yet � except for an oil change)

The multi-function display in the middle of the dash contains useful information such as a compass, fuel and trip computer as well as the date and time.  It�s easy to ready, with big block letters and also functional.  However, when you shut the car off the fuel economy and the trip duration get reset.  I wish there was a way for it to remember these settings should we need to stop for gas while on a trip.

The center console is handsome and all the buttons are within easy reach.  The console has fake wood trim which actually looks pretty good and isn�t tacky looking.  However, I would have preferred real-wood trim which is available as an option.  The cup holders fold out of the center console and are the best cup holders I have ever seen.  The cup holders are very sturdy, large, and fold smoothly into the console when not in use.

There are numerous buttons for the radio and the climate control.  They are logically arranged and have a quality feel.   Once you get used to the buttons, the radio and climate control systems are very easy to use.  A navigation system isn�t available.  Look for a navigation system similar to the one available in the 2002 Camry sometime in 2003.  The climate control system is efficient, quiet and has dual controls for passenger and driver.  This feature is extremely useful for us as my wife and I both prefer different temperatures.  A vent located in the rear of the center console, distributes air very well to back seat passengers.

The premium audio system by JBL contains 7 speakers including a subwoofer and produces 250 watts.  It includes an AM/FM radio, cassette and a six-disc in-dash CD change.  The system sounds excellent and the six-disc changer though noisy when changing discs, is very good.  One curious omission is the lack of radio control buttons on the steering wheel.  Most other cars in this class have this useful convenience feature.

The optional leather seats are very good and extremely comfortable � especially on long trips.  The seats are wide and supportive and are heated.  I especially like the memory setting, which remembers two settings for the driver�s seat as well as the settings for the rear-view mirrors.  It�s great to get in the car, press the button on the seat and the seat as well as the side mirrors go to my settings.  The driver has an 8-way power seat with lumbar support.  The passenger has a six-way seat.  I would have preferred 8-way with lumbar for both front seats.  The quality of the leather is pretty good but could be softer.  I would have preferred the butter-soft leather offered in Lexus models.

The optional moonroof in our car is exceptional.  It�s very large and really makes the cabin feel much bigger when the sunshade is open.  It operates flawlessly, is quiet and has a one-touch button to fully open the moonroof � a nice touch.   I�ve never been a big fan of moonroofs but I really like this one.  I�m 6�3� and I have enough headroom even with the sunroof.  Most other cars we test drove did not have enough headroom for me.

The driver�s window has a one-touch auto up and auto down feature, which is also a handy feature.  On the headliner, just forward of the moonroof, is a sunglass holder, which is useful and very nicely constructed.  The center console is very large and made of a soft, pressure sensitive material, which is very comfortable armrest.  There are nice large bins in the doors for maps and other small items as well as a large compartment in each door that is lined with felt and opens and closes � very nice touch.

Rear seat passengers are extremely comfortable with huge amounts of legroom and enough room for three across.  Headroom is good and I have enough headroom in the back.  The center armrest is enormous and has nice cupholders.  A center pass thru allow for skis or other large objects in the trunk to fit into the cabin if necessary.

An outlet (110V) located on the back of the center console, allows rear-seat passengers to plug in a laptop, TV or other device.  A very nice touch.  The carpets, floor mats and trunk mats are high quality.  Curiously, the mats are optional.  Come on Toyota, make these standard on your flagship model. 


PERFORMANCE
The Avalon has only one engine - a 210HP 3.0 liter V6 but it�s terrific.  This is the same engine the Lexus ES300 uses.  The engine is paired to a 4-speed automatic.  The engine is powerful, smooth and quiet.  The automatic is good but occasionally does not shift smoothly.  I would prefer a 5-speed automatic or a variable automatic transmission.

Acceleration is brisk � around 8 seconds 0-60mph.  The car is exceptionally quiet and wind noise is very low except when the moon roof is open.  The car handles well, has a firm suspension and corners well.  No one will ever mistake the Avalon for a sports car but it is fun to drive.   The steering feel, however, is poor and has little road feel.  In my opinion, it�s over assisted.  However, I do like the speed sensitive steering, which makes it a breeze to park. 

Fuel economy is excellent for a large car at 21 city and 29 highway.  I average between 25 and 26 in mixed driving.  The Avalon only required regular fuel (not premium) so fuel costs are low.

PRICE
The Avalon is not an inexpensive car but you get what you pay for which is near-Lexus luxury and Toyota reliability and resale value.  We did our homework and bargained to get our Avalon at near invoice price.
