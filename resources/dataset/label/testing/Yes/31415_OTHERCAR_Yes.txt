            I traded an Acura Integra for the Olds Alero. The Acura with an automatic
is a dog to drive.  The Alero moves out and is a pleasant surprise. It even outruns our Pontiac Grand Prix GT. The Acura with a five speed runs as well as a Miata; however, an automatic trans instantly transforms it into an Escort-like vehicle. Who cares that the Acura has better fit and finish when you are leasing for three years. If the Acura is so great, why wouldn't the Acura dealer buyout my lease? The Olds dealer bought the Acura and gave me better lease terms than Acura!<br><br>
