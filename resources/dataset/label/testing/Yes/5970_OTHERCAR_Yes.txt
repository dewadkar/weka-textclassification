            I have wanted this car since Honda came out with it!! My husband talked me out of getting one til &quot;all the bugs were worked out&quot;, but I think it was fully exterminated right off of the line. I finally got a 96' model in 98'and have loved every minute of driving it. I love the secure feel of this little car, nothing like the top off and a leisurely drive around the lake. Other than the ordinary maintenance, oil changes ect.I have had NO problems out of this little car and the room in this little thing....heck my 6'4&quot; brother-in-law fits just fine!!BIG recommendation for the Del Sol!<br><br>
