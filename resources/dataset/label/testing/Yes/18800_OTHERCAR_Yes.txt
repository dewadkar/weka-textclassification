            I own a 1998 Jeep Cherokee 4-door SE, 6-cylinder w/part time 4WD--purchased new. Mine has automatic transmission, cruise, and air--I bought a very basic model. Love it!

I work in construction, so a reliable, rugged, and durable vehicle is a must, and my Cherokee far exceeds my expectations in almost every way. In all honesty, I beat the heck out of this poor truck, and it keeps going and going and going. I currently have 40,000 miles on the odometer. [Side note: It fits comfortably in my one-car garage, with ample room to exit on both sides. I know that sounds silly, but it's important!]

&gt;&gt;Features: 4WD shift on the fly. I like not having to stop to shift into 4WD. Who wants to stop to lock the hubs? 6-cylinder overhead cam engine--pickup is spectacular [I'm sometimes embarassed when I hit the gas too hard &amp; it jumps off!]. I've had no problem driving daily in Chicago traffic. The seats are average for comfort and style, but I knew that at the time of purchase. There is a seat upgrade available. Front legroom is ample for me, but less so for taller drivers and passengers. Legroom in the back seat leaves something to be desired.

Cargo space is ample, with a deep, square space behind the rear seat. The spare tire hangs on one side of the cargo space however [bubble tire], and there is no space alloted for a full-size spare. The rear seat folds down completely to offer additional cargo space.

The heat &amp; air are still almost instantaneous after 2 years of ownership. I've noticed no deterioration in quality.

&gt;&gt;Drawbacks that don't bother me, but others might not like: This vehicle handles like a TRUCK! It is not a car-like ride--this is the &quot;real deal.&quot; Road noise is high, and the ride is generally bumpy. You definately get a feel for the road when driving. Engine noise levels are high, and I'm now quite accustomed to the sound of the tires whining on pavement.

The step-in height is high, especially through the back doors. If you'd be lifting a child in, this will start to wear on your back.

The part time 4WD can be tricky--please educate yourself on the mechanics of 4WD before purchasing. The model I have IS NOT intended to be left in 4WD under normal conditions--in fact, doing so will cause damage to the vehicle. Cherokee does offer a full time 4WD option.

&gt;&gt;Drawbacks that bother me: Gas mileage [real world-mine!] has come in quite low at about 14MPH/city &amp; highway. This has been a disappointment for me--the sticker offered 19-23MPH. However, I hear they are working on this for new models. My Cherokee does not include power windows or locks--my next one will! It gets tiring running around the vehicle locking up. 

No option exists for a split cargo door. I'd love for at least the window to open--it makes carting large items much easier. At present, the hatch door is one piece--when I'm carrying large items that stick out the back, I have to worry about the whole door being open.

It has a persistent pull to the right, driving either fast or slow. It's been this way since the beginning, and is a characteristic of this vehicle I'm not in love with. The dealer, and two independent shops all agree that while they could align it, alignment was a short-term solution that would probably make the problem worse in the long run. I've left it alone.

&gt;&gt;Service record/insurance: I've had no maintenance problems other than what would normally be required. I did have to replace the brakes at 27,000 miles, but I feel that is due to city driving, and not a problem with the product. Brakes were not overpriced at $105/dealer [front only/no rotor work]. Oil changes are not outrageously priced at about $25/oil change place. My full winter tune-up [plugs, etc.] was reasonable at $85/dealer. Tires are expensive at around $115/each--being in my business, I've had to replace two. However, the other two are still in good shape, and I will probably replace them next year.

My insurance did not significantly rise after my purchase. I previously owned a Pontiac Grand Am, and the total increase for the Jeep was $50/every 6 months.


All in all, this has been a very good vehicle for me. I do recommend it to friends, with specific emphasis on the drawbacks above. I don't feel this is the best &quot;family vehicle,&quot; there are others out there [minivans among them] that are a better choice for the price. However, if you need a good TRUCK that will present few maintenance problems, this is a great choice!
