            After graduating and getting my first real job, I decided it was time to buy my first &quot;real&quot; car. As usual when purchasing, I did my research. I wanted something sporty and considered the Acura Integra, Honda Civic Si, Neon, Nissan 200SX SE-R. Acura was over-priced as was the Honda and, well, the Neon was American (need I say more?) so I strongly leaned towards the Nissan. (Besides, I've owned two Nissan Micra's in the past and they have been very reliable). Buying the Nissan has been the best purchase I've ever made.
I have had this car for 5 years (it's a '95) and it has never had any servicing other than regular oil changes. I haven't even done the brakes! Excellent car, loads of fun to drive, very fast and lots of power. This car has great handling, great driver position and is comfortable.

I cannot even think of a negative comment to say about this car. Looks and runs like new.

I recommend this car to anyone. <br><br>
