            I purchased the Olympus D360L because of the price.  The cost was approximately $400.00.  Many of the sales reps we spoke with raved about this camera.  However, I've come to realize it is a great camera, but downloading the pictures is not as easy as I was lead to believe.  I love the picture clarity and quality, however I can't shoot more then 8 pictures at a time. Which of course is not good when I am at a family function.
OK, now the good news.  The quality of the pictures is fantastic because of some of the features of the camera.  The red eye reduction is great.  When I down load the pictures to my computer, I am able to fix some of the blured pictures and overall quality.  It has 1.3 megapixel, auto focus, automatic exposure and white balance, and many other great features.
Overall, I would recommend this camera to individuals who are looking for their first digital camera.  <br><br>
