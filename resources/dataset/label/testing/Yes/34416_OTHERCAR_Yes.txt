            Just to preface, I am a 3 time new Hyundai owner. I owned a 92 Elantra, a 97 Tiburon, and now have a 2000 Tiburon for 2 months. The car is a testament to Hyundai's dedication to increased quality and reliability. The standard Tib with no extras comes with these: power steering, 4 wheel disk brakes, dual airbags, pwr windows, pwr locks, pwr mirrors, cruise control, a/c, alloy rims, and am/fm cassette. Add those options to a Neon or Sunfire and see what the price comes out to. This combined with a 5 year / 60000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, 10 year /100000 mile powertrain warranty and a 5 year / unlimited mileage roadside assistance can not be beat. I traded my 92 Elantra in with 136000 miles. It was a solid first car. My 97 was also a good car but I fell in love with the 2000. It is a tightly constructed car with no squeaks or rattles and has a 2.0 liter 140 horsepower engine. For the $13500 price tag, I will be a Hyundai owner for a long time.<br><br>
