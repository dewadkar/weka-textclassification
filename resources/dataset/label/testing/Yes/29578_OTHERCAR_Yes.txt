            After much researching I bought a 2000 Quest GXE because the price was right.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with kids who does not want something too big.  I have only driven 400 miles on it but it is very easy to handle &amp; does not feel &quot;big&quot;.  The ride is smooth &amp; acceleration is great.  In fact, too good.  i find myself going faster than I realized (LOL).
I loved the fact that so many options were standard not like some of the other manufacturers. Now even the tv/vcr are already installed with no additional cost.  The base model which I bought has pw/pl,ac,cruise,tinted window, keyless entry,dual sliding doors, and roof rack.  The tv/vcr has jacks for headphones ...so you won't have to hear those movies while your trying to listen to the radio.  
Standard radio/cassette player is adequate....speakers front &amp; rear with option of &quot;fading&quot; out the rear and a &quot;mute&quot; button.  
Cup holders everywhere,multiple storage compartments and map holders make this vehicle a joy to take on long trips.
The only negative I have is that the gas tank cover does not lock something that I have been use to &amp; the steering wheel doesn't &quot;tilt&quot;.
