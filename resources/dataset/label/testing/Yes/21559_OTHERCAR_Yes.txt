            This car has been around for a long time.  It seems the longer it's around the better is gets.  This car is made of nothing but the best and is one of the finest their is. This car has the room and rate that people love.  Something has got to be good about this car for is to have been around this long.  I really the the car because of the luxury and the style it is made on.  The car has room and is a very beautiful car.  The car is also one of the top sold cars in my area on the cadillac lot.  If would recommend this car to anybody with a family that loves nice thing.  If you want to look big and be big, get the cadillac.<br><br>
