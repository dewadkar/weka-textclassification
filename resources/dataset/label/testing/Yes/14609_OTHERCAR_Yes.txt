            This is a review for the 2003 model.  The cost shown includes a $2000 trade-in and all the taxes and fees (Washington state).

I started my new car search, getting away from sedans, to looking at pickups.  I needed more flexibility in storage space, even though I don't haul dirt or big boxes everyday.  I then realized that I didn't want to sacrifice passenger room for the cargo room, so I turned to small-sized SUVs.  Usually, I have a philosophical problem with SUVs because they cost more, are inefficient with fuel use, and most people don't drive them off-road as intended.  But the Toyota Rav4's price was comparable to a replacement Honda Accord, and the estimated MPG was only a tick lower.  I got the titanium color with 2WD, auto transmission, quick options, privacy glass, CD/cassette/radio, mudguards, security system and auto-dimming mirror.  I do not recommend any add-ons such as fabric or paint guard unless you live near the ocean.

Some compliments:  (1) It is so much fun to drive.  (2) I love the fact that I sit higher and have all that passenger and cargo space.  (3) The fold-down / removable rear seats are great!  (4) First aid kit and roof rack are cheapo additions, but it doesn't hurt to have them.

Some concerns:  (1) I really didn't want the auto-dimming mirror, but could not deal to get one delivered without it, or without paying a higher delivery charge.  So I negotiated that out of my price.  It is not useless, and the compass feature would be great when roadtripping, but in everyday driving, I don't need it.  (2) I wish the intermittent wipers had slower-faster adjustments.  (3) My MPG is average at the very low end of the mfr's estimates.  I do city driving, but I'm like a "grandpa" driver, and expected better mileage.  I'm getting 21 MPG and was hoping for 24.

Update: after owning the Rav4 for a month I experienced my first tank of nearly-all-freeway driving.  I calculated a healthy 26.9 MPG which is a big relief.  The tires and suspension make for a lot of road noise on parts of the freeway that haven't been repaved in a long while.

Update:  after two months, the dealership had a "thank you" seminar for its recent car buyers where all sorts of questions were entertained.  I understood the Rav4 to be the equivalent of the Corolla in category, and therefore is subject to a little more noise, a little more shimmy than its upper class brothers, the Camry or 4 Runner.  Also I learned that the overdrive-off feature does not actually work until the engine is warmed up.  Which is unfortunate since the first thing I encounter in the morning commute is a long steep hill downward.  But I did learn that if I stayed in town under 40 mph, I could (slightly) improve my gas mileage by leaving the overdrive off (3rd gear driving).  And last thing, I'm echoing something someone said about the 2002 model... I wish the rear door opened to the curb side.  Oh well, I made my choice.

Update:  in reading other reviews, I should say that I do not hear a rattle in my RAV4.  Maybe it's due to where it is manufactured (mine is from Japan).  And for those interested in the MPG, I switched to a job 30 miles up the freeway in Tacoma, WA and my mileage is averaging 27-28 MPG.
