            I have not owned my 1997 Explorer long, but I'll tell you what. I wish I had!!! This vehicle is absolutely fantastic. It is extremely well made, powerful, feels tight and high quality. Mine don't have any of the supposed negative traits that other people have written about such as noisy interior or choppy ride. I expected what I got, afterall this is a four wheel-drive TRUCK. It is extremely smooth and very stable when driven within it's limits and not treated as a normal street car.
We tested a variety of SUV's, including Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada, Rodeo, Grand Cherokee, Wagoneer..ect........., before deciding on the Explorer. It was by far the best of the bunch. I don't want to take anything away from the others (except Rodeo, which I did not like), especially the Chevy/GMC/OLDS trio which were in my opinion outstanding vehicles too!! I have the 4.0 SOHC engine with 29000 miles now and frankly do not feel the difference between it and the V-8 other than the fact the 6 is noisier under hard acceleration. This vehicle is equipped with the beefed up suspension, 5 speed auto, 3:55 track-loc rear end and 16 inch wheels with LT255/70/16 tires. I would recommend all of these over other option combinations!!!
My explorer did suffer from the occasional metallic pinging noise from the front end that has been mentioned by other owners. It was not a problem, but is repaired by Ford free of charge due to a tech bltn. Apparently the noise is caused by slight binding of the front driveshaft slip yoke when the wheels are turned. The problem is solved by replacing the yoke with a improved version.
Fuel mileage has not been a problem, but then again I didn't expect miracles. This is a fairly large, heavy (over 4000lbs), and not so aerodynamic 4 wheel drive vehicle and should be purchased with that in mind. I am averaging 21.3 mpg at normal highway and town speeds and am pleased with that.
I would definately buy again. The only thing I don't like so far are the prices new!!!! 
I traded in a 1993 Eagle Vision which was by far the most reliable vehicle that I have ever owned (and I've had a lot), so the Explorer has a lot to live up to. So far it's doing nicely.
