            The Sony MVC-FD73 is an excellent Digital Still Camera. It is simple to use, and takes beautiful pictures. The built in 10X zoom makes it easy to take close up pictures or far away pictures from anywhere.

It takes a floppy disk so you can replace it and take more pictures when the first disk is full, unlike some cheaper cameras which must be downloaded directly onto your computer.

The picture quality is excellent. The camera is a bit expensive but if you take a lot of pictures and desire quality, I think this camera is well worth the difference.

If you aren't worried about getting great pictures, you can probably find much cheaper cameras that take adequate pictures for most purposes. 

One feature I really like is the view screen on the camera that lets you see what the picture will look like before you snap it. Once you have taken the pictures, you can also go through all of them on the camera without downloading them. This way you can be sure that you have a good set of pictures.

The camera has several settings for special effects including Sepia, B&amp;W, Neg. Art, and Solar

The Sony MVC-FD73 is powered by a 7.2 volt battery pack. It comes with a BC-V615 Battery Charger, Shoulder Strap, Lens Cap, and ArcSoft PhotoStudio. If you like, you can also purchase an AC-VQ800 AC Adapter if you wish to plug in to take pictures. 

If you would like to see the quality of the pictures taken by this camera, I have some examples from the Sony MVC-FD73 Digital Camera as well as some I took with the Jam Cam 2.0. The examples are located at

I would recommend it to anyone who loves to take high quality photographs.<br><br>
