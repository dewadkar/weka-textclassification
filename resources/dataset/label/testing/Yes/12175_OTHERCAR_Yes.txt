                My step dad has a Lexus. I can't believe how comfortable this car is!  You can't hardly tell if it's on or not. It drives smoother than any car I've ever ridden in. It has hydroulics that pump up one side of the car when you turn, so you can not even tell that you are turning.  I am sick of all the uneasy turns that these hydroulics eliminate.

   
    The air conditioner is very good.  You adjust the temperature digitally.  You can choose the exact degree you want the air.  The driver's side and the passenger side can be seperatelly controlled.


    The leather seats are extremely comfortable.  You can adjust the firmness, how far or close it is to the dashboard, the height of the seats, the tilt of the back of the seat, the height of the headrest, and the height of the buckle attachment.  They also have a seat warmer. The warmth is completely adjustable.

    The windshield wipers slide smoothly across the windshield without making that annoying squeaking noise.  When you turn off the motor, if they are in the middle of your windshield, they will automaticaly go down.  


    Even though it looks small, there is a ton of room.  It's trunk is gigantic!  My family; My mom, my sister, my dad and me, all went to Colorado for spring break on a skiing trip, despite having to put your feet on stuff that was in the floor board, we had room to put everything else in the trunk.  Since the trunk has a little hatch that connects the trunk to the inside of the car, we had enough room to put a ice chest with drinks in the trunk.  That way, when we wanted a drink, we just opened the hatch and got one.

    The best feature to this near perfect car is the global positioning satellite.  It tells you exactly where you are.  It also can tell you where the nearest hospital and police station is.  If you put in a location or address, it will trace the roads you take with blue, and a voice gives you step by step instructions on how to get there.  It will also tell you how long the distance is to a given location down to the tenth of a mile, and approximately how many minutes it will take to get there, traffic lights and other things that would interfere with the time counted.  It has come in handy quite a few times.
    
    The price is high, but if you can afford it, it is well worth the costly price!
