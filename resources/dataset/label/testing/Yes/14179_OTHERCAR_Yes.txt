            I sent my husband packing when I saw the commercial for .09% financing on the new Chrysler minivans.  I LOVED my '95, but I felt it was time for a change.  Unfortunately, I should have kept the old girl around for a few more years.

My new &quot;Cypress Mist&quot; voyager is a beautiful metallic green and a V-6 instead of a 4 cylinder.  I definitely like the extra power and the fact that the cup holders are adjustable (no more spilling hot coffee on the turns).  The design is sleek and I couldn't wait to use that new second sliding door for convenience. Well....

Some disappointments...One, the bench seat behind the driver's seat is considerably shorter than my old one to allow for the second sliding door.  This isn't really an issue except on longer trips when the kids want to stretch out and sleep.  The sliding door is a good convenience except when you are parked on a hill with the front of the van pointing downhill.  The door tends to roll onto you as you are loading cargo.  Also you must be at a direct 90 degree angle to push the latch and open the door.

Another annoyance is the missing trunk release.  Now, the van locks itself everytime you hit 14 mph.  It sounds great, but I spend a great deal of time unlock and locking doors to get everyone in and the groceries in the trunk.

Speaking of the trunk area... My old minivan had an adjustable rear seat to allow for wider cargo.  This one has only some little plastic hooks meant to hold my grocery bags that never seem to fit.  When I try to let the seat back down for storage, the adjustable headrests (also new) get in the way.

Oh well, it isn't all that bad, but for $21,000 I could have souped up old Betsie pretty good.  If you don't mind the petty annoyances, it is a sound car with good gas mileage and a nice look.

Outside, the design lacks some finesse as well.  There are flat areas where water drips from the roof and windows and pools on a dull black surface.  When the car dries water marks remain very visible at eye level. <br><br>
