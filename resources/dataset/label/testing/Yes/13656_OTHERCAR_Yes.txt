            I am a recent college graduate just starting out, so I bought my 98 Kia Sportage used because it was in my price range.  And because it had a lot of options some other standard model cars/SUVs didn't have.  For example, it has an anti-theft device, CD player, power windows and locks, and a standard driver knee air bag.  It is smaller than some other SUVs, but it is big enough that I sit higher than in a car.  Another feature I liked about it was the high back seats with head rests, I found out the value of head rests when I was rear ended in my old car a few months before I bought my Kia.  The back seats also fold down, giving the back cargo room for my dog and some camping gear.  
I will admit, I did get better gas mileage in my old car, but you can't have everything.  I also wish it rode a little smoother, especially on rough pavement and bumpy gravel.  Of course I can't haul anything very heavy with my Kia, but I really didn't think I ever would, so it's not a big deal.  The car was obviously made for smaller people, so I fit my 5'2&quot; body in quite comfortably.  My fiance, who is 6'1&quot;, fits pretty well in the front seat, but I wouldn't recommend him riding in the back since there is not much leg room.  
I would recommend this car for anyone who wants something fun to drive.  It is ideal for young single women like me because it is sporty, fun, and has enough room for friends when girls night out rolls around.  It is also small enough to manuver into tight parking spots.  I would also recommend this car to a family with smaller children since the back seats are small but high with head rests.
Overall, I have enjoyed driving my Kia.  It has given me the luxury of a new car (even though it's used) without costing me an arm and a leg.  And it gets me from point A to point B, which is really what counts most.
