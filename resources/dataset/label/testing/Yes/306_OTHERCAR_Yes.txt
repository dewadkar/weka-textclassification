            Sometimes, you want to drive a car just for the fun of it.  The feeling of exhilaration you get when you put away the mini van and park the sedan, then jump behind the wheel of a Sports Utility Vehicle that just makes you feel young, and free, and daring.

Fast, spry, agile, courageous, that is the <b>Nissan Xterra</b>.  Made for the young adventurer, made for fun, made for the road.  Rock climbers, social climbers, ski bunnies and grocery getting Mommies all will love the speed, the style, the grace that is the <b>Xterra</b>.

Built in Smyrna, Tennessee, this younger sister to the <b>Nissan Pathfinder</b> has become a huge hit with the twenty-something's, ready to get away and take off down the &quot;road of life.&quot;

This smooth little ride offers convenience, storage, and comfort.  The seats easily accommodated my husband, who measures over six feet, and I was very comfortable with the leg room in the back seat.  The rear offers a removable tray, equipped with compartments for handy storage.  The roof rack comes standard with another removable bin, perfect for storage of skies, bicycle accessories, or in our case, a sailboard equipment.

The canary yellow color that we chose was easy to spot parked at the local mall.  The interior cloth seats were a muted gray, very comfortable, and tasteful.  The electric windows were standard, and the cup holders were perfect!  Able to adapt to a jumbo Taco Bell cup, but fit my husband's coffee cup with no trouble.

My only complaint was with the trunk space.  With the tray placed in the back, excess room was very sparing.  

The engine was only as Nissan could make.  Smooth, quiet, talking to a back seat passenger required no raising of the voice, or screaming.  The ride was smooth too, I was a little worried about being jostled, but my concerns were alleviated as soon as my husband took us out on a gravel road, revved the engine, and slammed on the brakes, testing the <b>ABS</b> system, also standard in the Xterra.  The little vehicle came through my husband's stringent testing with flying colors.  We stopped clean, no skidding, no screaming tires.

The <b>Nissan Xterra</b> is an awesome vehicle.  Ask our fifteen year old son, who is drooling at the mouth at the anticipation of actually getting behind the wheel and driving one.  He will have to be patient just a little while longer.  Driver's Education will be completed August 9, and he will be able to test drive the <b>Xterra</b> with his Father.

I will be confident when he drives this vehicle.  Dependable, equipped with driver and passenger side air bags the Xterra is a great vehicle for any driver.

Especially the ones that &quot;<i>want to get away</i>.&quot;
