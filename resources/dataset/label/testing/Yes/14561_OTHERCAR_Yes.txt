            Gosh, if I can only tell you how many times I have taken pictures and <b>NOT</b> developed the film! I am so pathetic when it comes to that. This story is sad but true. When I got married for the second time (to my wonderful husband Doug), we paid for the wedding ourselves. We were young and broke. So, being the penny pincher I am, I called a local college and spoke with the photography teacher. I told him I would hire one of his students to take the pictures for me. He offered to take them himself. He would take 10 rolls for $100.00 and then it would be my responsibility to get them developed myself. That was a great bargain when you think I got to keep all of the negatives!!! Well, for my 3rd wedding anniversary, I found all the rolls of film and FINALLY took them to be developed! CAN YOU IMAGINE?

<b>NO MORE</b>! Now I just slip a floppy in my camera. When I want to view my pictures I slip the floppy in my &quot;A&quot; drive and viola! <i>A little added note: You can usually find floppy disks on sale with a rebate that actually equals their purchase price. Let's say you pay $15.00 for 50, you get a $15.00 rebate! Which means FREE! That is a lot cheaper than the chips most other digital cameras use.</i>

Another great advantage is the fact that I don't have to print every stinking picture I take. There are some pictures that just are not worth the paper. 

Lastly, my far-off relatives get instant gratification. I can email them pictures moments after taking them.

There are a few cons here. Digital zoom sucks! let me explain what optical and digital zoom are for those who don't know. Now this may not be the technical terms, however it fairly well explains. With optical zoom the lens pulls the object closer to you. Therefore, you lose nothing in picture quality. With digital zoom, your camera blows up the picture. This gives you less pixels per square inch and you lose picture quality. Less pixels per square inch = a fuzzy little photo!

For other reasons that are obvious to most professionals, I would not recommend this for a professional photographer as their &quot;main&quot; camera. When I studied photography, I learned that the best photographers always carried a camera with them. This may be the kind of camera you want to have for those &quot;just in case&quot; shots. However, for your real work, you need something that is more adaptable.

If you would like me to email you a sample of an actual photograph taken with this camera, please feel free to email me at controlhq@hotmail.com.

Good luck!
