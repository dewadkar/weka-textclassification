            Say what you will, I worked for Honda and still drove a  1993 Eurovan because the Odessey was too much of a "glorified car." When I transfered to Toyota the Sienna had even less appeal. 
I loved my big lumbering box! Yes the 93MV was quirky but it would comfortably haul seven family members with all luggage cross country to grandma's house in MO. or grandpa's condo in FL. 
Our van made three transcontinental journeys with no hiccups ( the 2.5 liter in-line five did really struggle in the Rockies above 10,000 ft. though) the old beast started getting ugly around 160,000 miles and my wife wanted a new vehicle. We looked at every thing from Kia to Suburbans and came to the same conclusion, another Volkswagen! So this makes the fifth one for us. 
Our 2001 GLS was bought just last month for my wife's 2003 Christmas. It was in near perfect condition with 27K miles. Rear captains chairs, Rondo alloy wheels and white paint to beat the heat(we now reside in TX.) made a perfect package. The dealer gave me $2000 odd dollars for the old one leaving me a drive out W/TTL of $16,400. 
It is a blast to drive! tight handling, awesome braking ability, very decent fuel economy,(we average 17 mpg around town & haven't made a road journey yet to figure highway mileage)I expect to get 23-25mpg plus because I got 21-23 out of the old one and the new 201 horse V6 is loafing at 65 to 75 mph where the old 5 cyl. did have to work much harder for the same results. 
Even my teen aged drivers in the family who hated the old 93 (they called it the Jauggernaut) enjoy being behind the wheel of the 2001. The only complaint is the sound system; (go figure) which I admit is kinda lame especially since VW has no in dash CD player option available. 
Up front storage is lacking, seating is very comfortable, visibility superb, controls easy to read and everyone loves the funky neon blue-red instrumentation!
The upgraded power train inspires confidence in traffic with seamless acceleration and passing. 
Middle seats are easy to pop out but rear bench is somewhat of a pain to remove. When it is out though, you would think a game of volley ball could take place inside! Its huge back there. I never did take the seats out of the old MV and our former Vanagons, Khombi's and Transporters were configured differently. Suffice it say, were happy. If you gotta haul "people and stuff" don't over look this one. Our purchase price from the dealer included a VW Factory Certified warranty so any possible problems are covered till 75k miles. We got a good deal so they are out there. I will end by saying the 93MV ran dependably with no problems till 160,000 miles at trade in.
The 85 Vanagon had 243,000 miles (yes I did say 243,000 miles) and the ONLY time it ever had a wrench on the engine was when it dropped a valve retainer around 21,000 miles which was covered under warranty. One water pump and CV joints around 180,000 miles.
I won't go into details of the air cooled VW's except to add that there has been at least one VW van in the immediate family since 1963.
