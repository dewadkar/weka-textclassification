            I've had my Kodak DC260 for several years now, so I know the camera inside and out.  First of all, let me state that this is a solid performing machine.  Its never gave me a day of problems (mechanically).  Picture quality has been top-notch.  This is a camera that you can count on.  The DC260's solid durability and performance makes it practical for house hunting and still photos (more on this below).  The pictures themselves are extremely clear with vibrant colors.  That being said, I would still point out flatly that this an OLD OLD model camera.

I got this camera after exhaustive research when it first came out.  I'm not a tech junkie and I count every penny I spend on technology.  In general, I go for VALUE.  However, I must say that when I first got it,  expected it to be more of a toy.  Was I ever wrong.  The $$ I saved in development alone EASILY paid for the camera twice over.  Think, it runs you $15 to develop a roll of film (minimally); plus the cost of a roll.  After just ten rolls you would would already be about $200 (with tax, gas and time).  Now half those pictures are going to be horrible (unless you are a professional).  In the course of just two years I was convinced that the camera had saved me money.

Now for the downside - this camera is a STILL camera only.  It is a bit slow to boot - meaning when you press "ON", expect to wait 10-15 seconds before you can take any pictures.  Likewise, between shots the camera is fairly slow.  It takes anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds before you can take another picture.  Even DURING the shot, there is a half second delay from the time you press the button to when the shutter actually flies.  This makes action shots out of the question unless you have become very accustom to the camera and can compensate.

A word about battery life - its just nominal.  But the $20 I spent on the Kodak re-chargable batteries and wall recharger more than adequate made up for it.  Its great! No wires or anything.  Just a simple, effective case that houses the 4 Kodak Batteries, a little pop-out plug and BAM!! I never spent $$ on batteries again.  Very portable and reliable. (note that this is an accessory and did not come with the camera).
