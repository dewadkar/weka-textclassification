            I have a 1994 Grand Voyager.  I purchased it with 50,000 miles for $8,000.  I have had it for almost three years now.  I use it to deliver greeting cards so it is driven with a huge amount of weight and I average around 30,000 miles a year on it.  It has been mostly reliable but does have some problems.

  First, watch out for the transmission.  This seems to be a common problem with these vans around 90,000 miles.  I first had it rebuilt but that only lasted 20,000 miles before I had to put a factory refurbished one in.  The brakes have also been a problem since I had the original drums replaced.  However, to be fair, this may the problem of the service people who installed them.  Other than those two things, I have had no problems with this van. 

 I have almost 130,000 miles on it and I do run it hard.  I only change the oil every 5,000 miles and have been very pleased.  I would think that if it was used as a family vehicle it would be even more trouble free.  I would recommend it over any other brand.  I liked it so much that when the time came to purchase a van for my family I chose the grand Caravan.<br><br>
