            This car is the best car in this price range and drives great. It combines quality, luxury, reliability, value, safety, and power. This car is great for anyone, a kid, an adult, a parent, or a car enthusiast. It has the best reliability I have ever seen for a car in this price range. Volkswagon is my favorite car company. They keep making quality cars while keeping their prices low. When I bought my Jetta, it didn't feel at all like I was being ripped off. This car will keep most of its value in years to come. If you have the money, buy this car!<br><br>
