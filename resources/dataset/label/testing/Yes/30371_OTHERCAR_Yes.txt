            Working for General Motors, I get the opportunity to take vehicles for test drives before they're released to the public. In July of this year, I was fortunate enough to take a spin in a Pontiac Aztek... <i>interesting</i>, to say the least.

At first glance, I'd have to say that I <i>extremely</i> disliked the design of the vehicle. The front end is a new, adventurous design for Pontiac, but the hatchback resembles that of the old Pontiac LeMans. I climbed in (that's right, I said &quot;climbed&quot;... the Aztek is a lot taller than most people think from the commercials... and I'm only 5'8&quot;), sat down, and immediately got comfortable (I drove the GT model with leather interor). I was surprised at how convenient the dashboard was, with all my comfort controls close at hand. In the center console is a cooler/CD case, which can be removed from the vehicle at any time and carried wherever you want to go. There are numerous cup holders in the vehicle (I've always said you can't have enough of those), and everything is very convenient to the driver's position.

After I started it up, I noticed a very smooth and comfortable ride. The Aztek makes no claims at being an SUV or a truck (it's the world's first &quot;SRV&quot;, or &quot;Sports Recreation Vehicle&quot;), and it doesn't ride like them, either. The handling is tight, the suspension cushy, and the ride is more comfortable than I ever expected. The 3.4 liter V6 pushed out a nice amount of power, and I was very happy with the fuel economy (the owner's manual gives an estimate of 19 MPG city/26 MPG highway) that I received, since I drove this vehicle all over the state of Florida during the week that I had it.

I decided at one point to see just how &quot;recreational&quot; of a vehicle this is. I took the Aztek and a friend of mine out to a park here in Tampa, and had a picnic. We put the tailgate down for a seat, but the &quot;grooves&quot; in the tailgate provide very little comfort, even for a slim person like myself. However, it provides an alternative for those who don't wish to sit on the ground and deal with pesky insects while they picnic.

And the Aztek is fully customizable, coming with a number of packages to suit your needs. The <b>Camping Lifestyle Package</b> comes with a custom tent that fits over the rear half of the vehicle, and an air mattress that rests on the tailgate for when you're &quot;roughing it&quot;. The <b>Hiking Lifestyle Package</b> gives you backpacks that attach to the front seatbacks, heavy-duty rubber loormats, and washable seat covers. The <b>Sport Appearance Package</b> adds a molded hood air deflector, vent visors, rubber floor mats, and an &quot;Aztek&quot; windshield decal. Finally, the <b>Biking Lifestyle Package</b> provides a specially designed bike carrier that attaches to the roof, an interior carrier that allows you to carry a bicycle inside the Aztek (with the rear seats removed), rubber floor mats, and washable seat covers. These option packages are the product of some innovative thinking (especially the Camping package), and we may see other automobile manufacturers attempting this kind of customization for their vehicles. 

Overall, I'd have to say that I was more pleased with my drive in the Aztek than any of the Sport Utility Vehicles that I've driven before, including the Nissan Xterra and Honda CR-V. The Aztek may not be the prettiest thing on the market, but with all the options and features, it's in a class of it's own!<br><br>
