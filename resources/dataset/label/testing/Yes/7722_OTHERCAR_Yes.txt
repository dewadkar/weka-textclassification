            In August of 1998, I was given a 1999 Tahoe 2DR 4WD Sport for my graduation present from my parents. They said that instead of a &quot;sports-car&quot; they would rather put me in something bigger, and not as fast.The thing they didnt know about the Tahoe's is they are very fast for their size(In fact I've outrun many other SUVs as well as fast cars in mine) and there are plenty of things you can do to make them more powerful. Mine for instance now has a K&amp;N ram-air kit and Flowmasters, which in total has added about 55 horsepower to to its 255 horsepower engine. Im not done yet though, but ill post up the new accessories when i get them done.The gas mileage of the Tahoes arent the greatest, but no SUV has it perfectly. Mine gets about 16 City,and 18 Highway.  I personally love the fact that they ride so smooth and their overall power and handling. Not to mention the space the truck has inside for the driver, as well as passengers, and plenty of space for moving large items or small. I feel it is exciting to be able to drive a &quot;SUV&quot; that has the capability to &quot;hang with the Sports-cars&quot;. I would advise many parents to buy their children or even themselves a Tahoe, due to the fact of its safety,comfort, and performance abilities. I truly enjoy my Tahoe and have recieved many complements on it, and I recommend a Tahoe to any type of consumer today. <br><br>
