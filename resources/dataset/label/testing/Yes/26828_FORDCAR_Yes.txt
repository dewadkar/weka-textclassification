I love the outdoors and this SUV can make all the difference between pleasure and pain for weekend excursions.

I decided to go for the gusto and bought the Eddie Bauer 4x4 with Triton V8 and towing package.  I had heard that the load balancing was an expensive and for the most part unuseful add-on so I avoided the salesmans hipe.  I love the feel of the car, excellent acceleration and comfort.  If you've driven a Navigator you've more or less driven an Expedition.  Though the Navigator has a heavier feel to it and in my opinion is a tad sluggish.

Get the extra options, otherwise you're just another Expedition going down the road.  I've seen too many XLT's people have boughten thinking they saved money.  They may have saved money, but I believe my time and comfort are worth it; believe me I just drove across country (1700 miles) in two days by myself.  The week before I drove my sister across country (Same exact trip) in her 99 Sport Explorer and it took us three days!  Comfort is everything, as long as you can get it at a reasonable price :) !
