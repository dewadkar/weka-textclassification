            The 1996 Chrysler LHS is probably the best car made in the entire year of 1996. I've ridden in this car so many times and it's almost as great as driving it. The seats(which are leather by the way) are so comfortable. They are a little crowded if you have 5 or more people in the car, but what car isn't. It's very roomy if you have 4 people or less. The seats are as soft as a baby's bottom. The ride is so smooth I've fallen asleep several times while someone else was driving of course. It handles great, especially around corners and sharp turns.

It's a great family car and is a good ride because it's smooth, very few bumps in the road, and the kids never complain. Friends have even sat in the back seat and traded basketball and football cards with no balance or manuverability problems. It's a lot of fun to drive this vechile as it has the desireable V6 engine. The only knock on this car is the price, which is in the $32,000 neighborhood. It's well worth it though. Roomy interior for 4 or less, great radio and cd system. One of the best cars out there!<br><br>
