            I bought my first New Yorker Fifth Ave seven years ago.  It was a 1990 and had been owned by a couple in their 60's, which is exactly why I bought it to begin with.  You see, despite the fact that all my 30 something and now 40 something friends kid me (as do my kids) about driving a grandpa's car, I was so in love with my 1990 5th Ave I bought another one, this time a 1991.

There are pros and cons to every single car you can think of.  On the plus side, I now have 152,000 miles on this car and I haven't had to put a dime in it.  Of course I didn't put any money in my 90 either; the only reason I got rid of that car was to buy a new 96 custom conversion van that I kept exactly 95 days and got rid of because I was the only one ever in it and it was costing me way to much.  Besides, the stereo sucked.  

Another thing that I consider as a plus for the 5th Ave is it's comfort.  I drive every day for a living.  I am in that car five or six hours a day five days a week.  Yeah, I suppose I could have gotten something that is more ergonomically correct, but personally I really like feeling like I'm sitting in my lazy boy when I drive.  It's too bad they don't make cars this comfortable any more.  

Another reason I've always liked my 5th Ave is the price.  When I bought this one three years ago, I paid a whole $7700 for it.  When I look at what other so called luxury cars are selling for I'm appalled.  My car would sell for about 2500 dollars right now, or so I'm told.  For 2500 dollars someone could drive this car to over 200,000 miles and still maybe only have to put a few hundred in it.

Yes, there are a few things I would prefer this car had.  The suspension is what you'd expect from a dated sedan.  It's soft and squishy around the corners. The brakes are soft.  The gas mileage is a bit less than average by today's standards.  And, the styling is very dated.  

Actually, maybe that's part of it's appeal.  In a day of every thing looks too much alike, the boxiness and elegant salon styling is something that sets this car apart from all the rest of the pedestrian looking sedans out there today.  It really is a classy looking car for it's time.  At least the over 60 crowd here in Northern Colorado seem to think so. 

One last dig ... the power .. despite the fact that Chrysler's six cylinder is one of the better pulling sixes out there, I would wish for a few more horses ... not that I needed them.  On a trip cross the Rockies to California two years ago I had the speedo buried to the hilt, which means I was going at least 105 across the flats of Utah and Nevada .... ssshhhhh...don't tell the staties on me, okay?

Bottom line:  better than decent car for a very reasonable price in the used market.<br><br>
