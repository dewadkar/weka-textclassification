            When I saw that this car was for sale, I couldn't resist buying it. The sleek look that it has besides the fact that its a 93 vechile gives it a look of class. With a 3.1 liter v-6 under the hood it gives you the power that you might need should it arise. Personally, I have the 4-door Euro option. But still I have to love my new(used) car. With all the options of Air, Power windows, Locks, Automatic, and cruise control; I would have to say that this is one of the best cars I personally have ever bought. Driving this vechile is pretty nice. With smooth handeling and tight steering its easy to go around curves and to keep a steady hand. I would reccommend this vechile to adults with kids or a couple looking for a good car that wont let you down for a good price. <br><br>
