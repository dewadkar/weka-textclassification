                What new car earned J.D. Power and Associates' &quot;Most Appealing Entry Midsize Car&quot; for 1999?  I'm glad you asked; presenting the 1999-2000 Volkswagen Jetta.  It's just been redesigned for 1999, making it sleeker, more noticeable, safer, and just all around a much better sports sedan.  Starting at just a little under 17 grand, the new Jetta remains one of the most sought-after entry-level sedans of the decade.  And with good reason.  When the German automaker decided that they wanted to start from scratch, creating a completely new automobile, they didn't cut any corners.  Driving the new Jetta reminds one of the previous Jetta, but at the same time completely erases it from thought.  Still familiar is the 2.0L inline 4 cylinder engine, which develops a modest 115hp and 122 lb-ft of torque.  However, one drive of the 4-banger equipped VW and you're hooked.  This doesn't feel like 115hp.  Rather, the figure of 135 comes to mind. This is due to the engine developing maximum torque at only 2,600 RPM, something that most 4's can't compare to.  Things that are new to the senses are the improved seats, which are extremely comfortable, the bigger sunroof, new wheels, nifty dashlight colors (numbers on guages in blue and position hands and buttons in red), and one very significant improvement, the replacement of the previous automatic transmission with that of the Audi A4 tranny.  
THE TECHNICAL STUFF
    Now for the nitty-gritty.  The new Jetta comes with 4 engines to choose from: the old, faithful 2.0L 4cylinder mentioned above, the same 2.8L, 174 horsepower, 181 lb-ft of torque VR6 cylinder engine offered in the previous model, a repeat of the 49 miles-per-gallon on the open road Turbo Direct Injection Diesel (TDI), and an all new Audi powerplant, the 1.8L Turbocharged 150hp, 155 lb-ft of torque 4 cylinder.  This new engine is very impressive.  Delivering maximum torque output at only 1750 RPM, this new addition to the line-up produces nearly identical performance figures as the 2.8L, 750 dollars extra 6 cylinder.  Something to think about.  The 4-wheel fully independent suspension provides handling sure to please even the most demanding enthusiast, while at the same time maintains a highly-enjoyable, &quot;comfortable for those long trips&quot; ride.  The 4-wheel ABS and large discs on all four corners coupled with standard 15 wheels shod with 195 H-rated tires provides all the braking and handling one could ever expect.  15 and 16 (only on VR6) inch alloy wheels are available and add lots to the car's character.  The alloy wheels are packaged with the power sunroof for $1500, termed the &quot;Luxury Package&quot;, and is well worth the extra 1.5G's.  Now, I drove the 4 cyl automatic and the VR6 manual.  Both had traction control, which could be turned off for fun, or switched on in rain, winter driving, or for continuous safety.  Driving the VR6 with the stick was quite an experience.  Who would've thought that a Volkswagen could spin the tires after shifting to 2nd gear!  The 4 cyl automatic seemed very smooth and civilized, but at anytime could downshift and unleash its power, which was rather impressive.  
SHOULD I BUY IT?
    Yes.  The new Jetta is without a doubt the most impressive new sports sedans on the market.  The only person who shouldn't buy one is a mom or dad that has to haul 3+ kids around everyday, in which case something larger would fit your lifestyle.  However, if you're looking for fun, style, and affordability, the Volkswagen Jetta is your best bet.  The 4 cylinder engine is economical, rather zippy, and well-suited to the car, while the 1.8T or the VR6 is more performance oriented.  Want 49mpg?  Go for the TDI.  Configure it to your liking, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed.  As for me, my Silver Arrow with black leather GLX awaits.  For more information, visit www.vw.com/jetta/?
