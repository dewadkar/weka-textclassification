            So what's wrong with Scirocco's?  Opinions are a little sparse on this (if you ask me) great car here, so here's one from me.  I (still) know this is an American site, but I hope you enjoy the UK perspective on this car too, as it seems at least five people liked what I wrote about my new car (see Toyota Celica 1994).

The Scirocco seems to be the least loved child of Volkswagen - it certainly doesn't rate in peopleï¿½s opinions as highly as the Golf (erm...Rabbit on your side of the sea) or the Polo (Fox).  This is hardly fair, as the Scirocco is certainly the sportier looking of the three and shares essentially the same mechanics as the Golf anyway.  My Scirocco was my first ever car, it was a black GT2 with five spoke TSR 16" alloys.  The GT2 has the body kit used on previous models, which comprises a front air damn, side skirts and an extended skirt under the rear bumper, it also has a larger rear spoiler.  Unlike models prior to the Scala (1.8 injection), the bodykit is colour coded, which produces a far better look than, say, the GTX, which had the bodykit in black plastic, regardless of the paint colour.  The GT2 has well shaped fabric covered seats, a generally more filled out and better finished interior than earlier models and is quite comfortable to all intents.  The rear headroom was a bit silly, but people in the back were a rarity when I was driving anyway.  I drove miles and miles in my Scirocco (about 40,000 miles in a year and a half) and it handled it very well indeed, with the exception of two things.

The seats are comfortable when you first sit in them, but I found that spending more than three hours or so at the wheel gave me backache, no matter how I sat or adjusted the seat.  Funnily enough, the chap who sold me the car said he was doing so for precisely that reason.  This in itself isn't a real detractor from the car over all, but it's annoying none the less.

The gearbox.  My Scirocco was an automatic and even after learning in an automatic Vauxhall Corsa, the three speed transmission in the Scirocco was primitive.  It was no end of trouble for the entire duration I drove the car, dropping out of gear at low speed, refusing to change up or drop down to accelerate and generally making driving a hap-hazard affair to say the least.  

Another thing that's just part of the car and you get used to it after a bit of driving are the brakes - they're awful.  I've been told that, when the Scirocco was produced for the UK, although the driving position was moved from the left to the right, the master brake cylinder couldn't be moved, so there's a devious linkage system from the brake pedal on the right to the cylinder actuator on the left.  This introduces play into the system and some of the braking effort is lost there.  This coupled with the fact that the Scirocco only has front disks and rear drums means that the brakes are pretty bad at the best of times.  My car being an automatic, I tended to be harder on the brakes and brake fade became a real problem - most scarily one day at the bottom of a hill coming onto a roundabout, when I sped through the traffic with my brake foot hard to the floor and all four wheels happily turning.  You get used to this and you end up leaving much bigger safety gaps in front of you and planning your braking much further in advance, so perhaps it's a good thing?

The first service was the start of a wallet emptying affair like no other.  My girlfriend at the time had sent the poor old car hurtling through the air after tackling a humped-back-bridge rather enthusiastically and the front suspension took a battering, as did the exhaust, which became a saga in itself.  The first service, then, cost me six hundred pounds to have the front suspension remounted and the exhaust down pipes replaced, along with a hundred and one other small things.  I went back to three other garages to try and get the exhaust sealed after that and none could conquer the devious clip and spring assembly, which holds the thing together.  Then the gearbox failed.

Apparently the seal between the differential gearbox and the transmission proper had failed and the oils had mixed, ripping the gears apart.  One and a half thousand pounds later (I'd blown the head gasket to boot) I had a car that drove much better, but it was short lived.  It wasn't long before the gearbox started playing up again and I quickly traded the car in for something better (I was older and richer).  The car cost me two thousand pounds to buy and it must have cost me double that to keep it on the road over the year and a half I had it.

All that aside, though, the Scirocco handles fantastically.  Even with the dubious Continental tyres I fitted to it at the recommendation of one of the many garages I visited, it stuck to the road despite my best efforts to get it do otherwise.  In the wet, though, it was another matter entirely, I could get all four wheels sliding with next to no effort and I actually ended up quite enjoying the questionable handling.  Quick, it was not, though.  I once saw 125mph on the speedo, but that was down hill after about five miles with my foot to the floor.  110mph was attainable but as the car started to fall apart and things kept going wrong, all the fun was taken out of going fast.  Anything over about 90mph put me in mind of the X1 pilots back in the 40's, with everything shaking, having to yell over the noise, just waiting for the engine to blow to bits or the wings to fall off.  That said, 90mph across country was relatively comfortable and the fuel economy was quite good at about 35 miles to the (UK) gallon.

All in all, my Scirocco dropped, wore out, destroyed or otherwise stopped working for the following reasons in eighteen months:
Front suspension mounts
Exhaust down pipes (twice)
Exhaust down pipes to centre section joint (it never ever fitted back together)
CDI unit - immobilised the car for two days until I could replace it
Starter motor - needed replacing after the stator windings unwound!
Carb icing - the intake heating pipes kept coming loose
Automatic choke water feed pipe - burst
Gearbox failure
Head gasket
Ignition switch burned out
Instrument lights failed and then...
...fuel and temperature gauge stopped working
Back seat fell out of its mountings - the passengers weren't amused
Engine mounts perished and needed replacing - fitted the wrong type and the car vibrated like anything when the starter turned over

My Scirocco was, to be honest, a one off in the respect that so many things went wrong with it; it was really a very nice car to own and great fun to drive when it was working properly.  Did it live up to my expectations?  Well, it was certainly more fun to be in than my Dad's Polo and it had fairly good performance and my expectations were fairly simple back then - all I wanted was a car that went fast, could go for miles and didn't go through too much fuel, so yes, it easily lived up to my expectations.

I don't think anyone should avoid this car, it's eminently practical (I moved flat twice and used it to carry the majority of my stuff) and it *can* carry four people, although I wouldn't recommend it.  That said, Scirocco's are getting old now, so if you're thinking of buying one, you must be prepared to look after it a bit; check and change the oil regularly and keep it serviced - especially keep an eye on the automatic transmission oil quality and level.
