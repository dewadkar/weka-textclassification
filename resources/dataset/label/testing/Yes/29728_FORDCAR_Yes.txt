            I brought my 1994 Ford Eddie Bauer Edition Bronco because I like to be able to see the whole road ahead when in a long line of traffic. It's big wide yet, compact compared to a larger suv. Room enough inside for five adults to sit with room to spare for a small child on the wide rear bench seat.  

I love the full rush of power you get from the big eight cylinder engine, the state of the art sound system, passive locks,power everything! And the snow.....forget about it,  you would think it snowed just for you to show off how you could handle in any weather with the auto locking hubs.

The only thing I have about this Bronco and I do mean the ONLY thing I hate about it is when the gas price goes up and it cost me at times 30-40 dollars a week to keep this baby running.

But to own one is to love one.

We don't need more Expeditions bring back the Broncos for the REAL MEN<br><br>
