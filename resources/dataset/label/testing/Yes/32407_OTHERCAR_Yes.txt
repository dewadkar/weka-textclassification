            I bought my Honda Civic because I wanted to something that would like good for fairly cheap. I got a black 2-door Ex with manual transmission. I've had it for a year and so far it's been a good car. I've noticed that it has some problems in the cold and in rain. The keyless entry went out pretty fast. I had to change the batteries which wasn't too hard but just a pain. Overall, it's a good call and it's pretty realiable. Hopefully this review has helped you out. Oh yea, and they back seats fold down which is good if you surf, like me.<br><br>
