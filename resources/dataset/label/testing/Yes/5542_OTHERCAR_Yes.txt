            Talk about being sorry!  I just got through leasing a 1997 Tahoe. I wanted to lease another SUV.  I looked at all the other SUV's.  Many are too small, size and power wize, and some are too big (trust me, you will have to park it someday in a parking garage).  I narrowed it down to the Tahoe and the Dodge Durango.  Oh, What a difference.  The Tahoe stands head above heals to the Durango.  Both in size and in comfort.  Driving both vehicles you can just tell that the Tahoe is a higher quality SUV.  It has more muscle and control while giving the passengers the best ride of any SUV today, bar none.  If you can get past the gas hungry nature of the Tahoe and the lack of 90's technology in the cabin, i.e. no climate control or night sentinel headlights, the Tahoe is truly the best SUV you will ever drive. <br><br>
