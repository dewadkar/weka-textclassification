            The Fuji MX-500 is a great camera:

Features:

-1.5 Megapixels
-Smartmedia storage comes with 2 or 4 mb card, upgradeable to 32mb
-two picture sizes 640x480 and 1280x1024(huge)
-there are 3 picture modes fine, normal, basic(it's a good idea to always have the camera on fine mode, basic mode will produce jaggies on the picture)
-a 16 mb card can store 29 super fine 1280x1024 pictures or 96 super fine 640x480 pictures
-four flash modes(red eye, auto, always on, off)
-10 second self timer
-manual mode
-requires 4 AA batteries
-2X digital zoom(fake zoom)

If your looking for an excellent point and shoot camera without optical zoom, this camera is a great value.  I bought it used at ebay for $300
