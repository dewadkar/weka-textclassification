            I just received a new Mustang convertible for my 25th wedding anniversary.  If you are looking for a performance review, STOP reading now.  But, if you are looking for the opinion of someone driving a great little car, read on!!

This is my second Mustang, the first was a coupe.  Since it was time to begin looking for a new car, I made the rounds, trying to find a suitable car for a 50 year old lady.  Nothing seemed to fit the bill like a Mustang convertible.  Its just right for two (you can fit a couple of people in the back seats, but don't expect to go very far without allowing them to stretch their legs!).  It has great handling and pickup.  Getting on the freeway is a snap and keeping up with traffic is no problem.  Gas mileage was a little better on my 96, but it still gets 24-26 on the highway and 20 around town.  The top is easy to put up or down, so I keep it down most of the time.  If you are looking for a car that is fun to drive and great to look at, the Mustang is for you.
