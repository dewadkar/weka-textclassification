            Being from Texas, it's natural to want a truck.  I have wanted one ever since I could drive, but could never afford one.  I finally got my F150 last March (1999).  It's an extended cab with 4 doors (not four full doors, just the half-door in the back) and has power locks, windows, mirrors, power steering, automatic transmission (didn't get a CD, but the stereo system is still good with a cassette).  I especially like that I didn't give up car comfort to get a truck.  It rides as smooth as any car I've ever had and is really easy to handle.  I didn't have to adjust to it at all.

I was concerned about getting a truck as our family vehicle, because I have two children, ages 2 and 5 (my husband has a Ranger, which definitely is not big enough for 4 on a road trip).  I was worried the back seat wouldn't be big enough for car seats, but once I drove it with car seats in, I knew that this was going to work and I could get my truck.  The boys really enjoy it, cause they both have their own window and can see out in every direction, not like when they were in a car.  It is also a lot wider than my car, so their is plenty of room between them.

Since they redesigned the F150s, it is more comfortable to ride in and has more amenities than trucks did when I was a kid.  I use the bed every once in a while for hauling things like firewood, but it's great to carry groceries-just throw them in the bed...you could carry enough groceries for a small army.  It's also nice to know that if we get a boat or camper (which we hope to), we don't have to worry about how we will tow them.

I feel very safe in my truck, especially when driving down the highway with all the 18-wheelers.  I don't feel so small next to them and I feel better knowing that if I were in a wreck, my boys and I would have a better chance of walking away (not necessarily against an 18-wheeler, but with most any other vehicle).  As a mom, safety is of the utmost concern, and I feel that this truck is much safer than any car.  It has that &quot;heavy feel&quot; when you close the doors, so you know it's solid.

If you've always wanted a truck, like I did, and want the smooth ride of a car and room for the kids, I'd highly recommend the F150 supercab.<br><br>
