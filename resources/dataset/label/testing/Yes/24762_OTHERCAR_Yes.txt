            If you're looking for a great digital camera for a great price, get the Olympus C-720.  Like most of you, I'm not a professional photographer, but in the first week I was able to take what I consider to be some very nice shots.  See some samples at www.citlink.net/~mtidwell/June_2002.htm.  Yes, I took these with the C-720 with no special lenses or lighting!  After reading the extensive manual, I quickly came to the conclusion that this camera will do a LOT and I'm going to have to experiment with it quite a bit to learn all of its capabilities. The only beef I have is the slow auto-focus only, no manual focus.  Though the manual zoom is accurate, it can be a bit slow when you're trying to catch a fast moving object. For example, I was trying to take a shot of my dog as he was running toward me . . .forget it . . .the focus was just too slow. Olympus' suggestion is to "pre-focus" on the subject, then take the shot.  Okay, sounds good.  But why not include a manual focus?  The 8X optical zoom is awesome. Coupled with the 3X digital (to get 24x) it is incredible.  As with other high-zoom cameras, use a tri-pod for high zoom shots or a VERY steady hand. The 8X optical zoom is so good, I rarely use the digital zoom at all. Though this camera has a smaller rear viewing monitor than most cameras in its class, it hasn't bothered me at all.  I can still review photos with ease and it saves on battery life. The quality of the photos is remarkable.  My wife and I have taken quite a few "jaw-droppers" in just the first few weeks of owning the camera.  It's nice not being saddled with film processing costs and delays. You can review the shots right on camera and delete what you don't want. Consequently, we've taken more pictures with this camera in a few short weeks than with all the other cameras we've owned, combined!  So far, the battery life is amazing as well.  Around 400 shots! IMHO, it blows the 2MP cameras away.  Get a 128MB card and you'll have a hard time filling it up in one day.
