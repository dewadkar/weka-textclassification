            We needed a vehicle to serve two needs:  highway driving for long trip AND the power to pull a two-horse trailer.  Many trips later and a few trailer pulls and this has been a good decision for us.

We bought this used (1998) at the end of 2000.  There have been several small repairs that needed to be made though nothing major.  A/C hose had become disengaged so was blowing air out on floor in front vs. in back where it needed to go, front speakers out ... things like that.  We did put larger tires on it and found that the mileage DRASTICALLY decreased but that is only because the computer is not calibrated to adjust to different rotations so ... not sure what affect the larger tires may have really had.  We put the original size back on and we're back to "normal".  Some folks say that the engine additives don't really work; we are trying one out and feel it IS helping but we use this primarily for highway driving so don't know if would have the same effect for in-town driving.

Right now we are dealing with a mysterious rear end griding and scrubbing sound.  Our very reliable mechanic has not been able to hear it (how come it never happens when you want it to?) but it is getting worse.  Checked U-joints and all other common areas it might be.  Now doing some research to see if any other '98 Durango owners have come across this situation.

Overall, we have really been pleased with this vehicle and would recommend it to folks who go into the purchase understanding that this is not something to get if looking for high gas mileage but IS for folks who want the versatility of towing power and highway comfort.
