            This car has been in my family for 4 years now, we bought it with 148,000 miles, it now has 183,000 miles. This has been just about as reliable as all of the Hondas around my house, and that says alot. My sister drove the car for the first 3 years we had it, then her boyfriend wrecked it and I got it, I have been driving it for a little over a year now. I kind of beat it, I guess I think it is a sports car because it is very fast, I race at every red light I can! The only major repairs I done to the car were done by my Dad and I, we changed the brakes, the clutch, and the cv axles at 179,000 miles. That is all we have done to the car since we have owned it. However the radiator is about rusted completely out, so that is the next repair, I guess this is where it nickle and dimes me to death. This car is obviously good, 183,000 miles, no rebuilt engine, and still has loads of power, I raced a '99 mustang (3.8 liter stock) and he barely beat me, the car held up well considering he had a liter and a half more than me, as well as 160,000 less miles. Even though the car doesn't have the turbo, it is still unbelievably fast.
