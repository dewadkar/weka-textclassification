            	Heard any good YUGO jokes lately? How about the one where Yugo raises the price of the GV to the $7000-8000 range and then starts a sales campaign "Buy one, get one free?" Established in 1953, The Zastava Automobili Company created a now infamous Sub-Compact car; you might know it as the Yugo. However, the last decade has taken it's toll on the small car company. I will tell you of these hardships, the ups and downs of the model over the years, and unique specifications of the Yugo.

	The Yugo was rated in Poland: The Charismatic Car of the year of 1972, Car of the year in Yugoslavia from 1982 to 1992, and the official car of the 1984 US Olympic Volleyball team. Not all of this company's history has been all . In 1992, the Yugoslavian Civil war was going on and the Zastava Yugo Plants were taken over by the Serbian Rebels. They melted down the little cars to make bullets and other ammunition. The US thought this was a valuable resource so they bombed the small car factories. The
happy workers were not so happy anymore. The US did more harm than good to the war effort. The Yugo company had to lay off the employees and that damaged Yugoslavia's economy.

	For the technically inclined, The Yugo has a 4cyl 1116cc SOHC Single Overhead Cam Engine) with a standard 3-5spd Transmission. It can go from 0-60mph in about 13.7 seconds and has a top speed of 96mph. Depending on the model, it can get 31 to 55 mpg (Miles per gallon). Surprise of surprises, the little 4-banger loves to rev and will move
the 1800Lb Super-Box up or down the road better than you would think. The Yugo was no beauty outside or in. Niceties included power assisted front brakes (Drums Rear), Rack and Pinion steering, fully independent suspension, full carpeting, reclining front bucket seats, rear window
wiper/washer and more. There were quite a few nits to pick: Noise, vibration and harshness control is not a high art there; there is no glovebox; the horn sounds like it was lifted from that "Little Nash Rambler song"; flimsy plastic lines the interior; I could go on, but the point is you could live with a lot of these in it's time.

	Is the Yugo a Communist Fiat? Not really. True, the Yugo's diminutive 1116cc engine is based on the fiat design and the car bears a remote resemblance to a Fiat 128 sedan, it is all Zastava. In 1986, the Yugo came to America. The GV model was the only model that year. It lacked power, but it gave cheap transportation at $3990. In 1988 they
made the GV (standard; Our same Super-Box from last year), the GVL(touring), and the GVX (Sport) with a stunning(for a Yugo) 1500cc 5spd engine. In 1990, they dropped all the current models and made the GV PLUS (Not so cheap anymore at $5000) and the GVC a limited edition (of only 80 made) convertible. They (MSN Cars) estimate that there are only
around 30 convertible Yugos left today. 

	As you can see, the Yugo's life was a long and eventful one. The Legacy still lives on though; How do you get a Yugo to go 60mph? Push it off a Cliff. I will close our story with actual sales Pitches: Introducing the
same old idea, Everyone has to own a Yugo sometime, Yugo: Peace of Mind comes standard, It might not say you play polo with Prince Charles but it will say you hate car loans, It has the same fuel injection system as a Porsche but you don't have to sell it when you get married, and The Yugo: $3990

	If you need help making a decision on buying a Yugo or not, I would. I think you should too. Not to drive and use, but to restore and preserve. There are less than 10,000 Yugos left and only 30 of them are Convertibles. It's the worlds second best Compact collector Car ever! (Second only to the Mini)
