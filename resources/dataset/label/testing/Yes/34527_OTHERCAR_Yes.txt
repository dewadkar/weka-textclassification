                 I searched for months before I chose this camera. I compared prices, resolutions, and looked at sample pictures before I bought this camera. After owning this camera for 6 months and taken hundreds of pictures I must say I couldn't be happier. 
     I was the type of novice photographer that received little stickers on my pictures when they returned from developing. Stickers that had tips like use flash etc. Having this camera has improved my skill greatly and saved me a ton of money in developing bad pictures. With the 1.8&quot; LCD screen I can review my pictures instantly. If the pictures are bad I can delete the picture and not even bother downloading it into my computer. 
      This camera was very easy to use and the picture quality is fantastic. It has auto focus (perfect for me the novice), 24 bit color, a choice of 3 resolutions, and very easy to use software. It doesn't have zoom or manual control of shutter speed but I find I don't need them for the type of pictures I take anyway.
      The software included with the camera is capable of printing out an index sheet of your pictures which comes in handy after awhile. When I got to the point of having a couple hundred pictures saved I sometimes forgot the file names. The software is also capable of adjusting pictures so that if they are a little dark or not quite sharp enough you get a second chance. 
      I have printed out some of my more worthwhile pictures onto photo quality paper and had fantastic results. I find there is not much difference with the pictures I printed out using this camera and the pictures I took with a 35mm and had developed. Of course photo quality paper and printer not included.
