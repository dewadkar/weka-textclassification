            I bought a 1997 Ford Taurus last year, it was used as a former rental car and had nearly 50k miles on it, but it was in excellent condition.

After driving this vehicle all year, including a trip from Texas to Florida, I have been extremely pleased and have not had one problem at all.  Being a typical female, I have not done much maintenance to it either, aside from putting gas in it, oil changes, and one tune up. I have never broken down or left stranded because of vehicle troubles. I attribute this to Ford producing a reliable, quality product. 

Also, for all of the features you get with a Taurus, it's the best value for the money, a very affordable car.  The interior is comfortable and plush, and the exterior body style is modern and leaves the impression that of a more expensive sedan.

The one thing I do not like about the Taurus is that the backdoors do not have automatic door locks, so it is a hassle sometimes to get something out of the back seat, then have to open the front door again just to lock all of the doors, this is annoying when your hands are full especially. 

Other than than, I am one of those statistical consumers who loves their Ford Taurus.   <br><br>
