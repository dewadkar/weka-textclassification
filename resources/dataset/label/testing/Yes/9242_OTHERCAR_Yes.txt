            I worked at a ford dealership for over three years, driving just about anything imaginable (other than ford from the used car lot). I had driven a few imports, but wasn't to impressed with the ride or interior space. 
I was driving a 92 explorer and looking to trade in. I knew I wanted a import, but none of them seemed to twinkle my eye. Alas, I came upon a Subaru dealer (knowing full well I'd end up there), and my sight glanced upon what appeared as the most stylish import I'd ever seen. Ground effects, hood scoop, perfectly styled cylinderical fog lights, black on black, it was beautiful. I gazed it over and over and finally test drove it. It was absolutely one of the best vehicles I had ever driven. 
I convinced myself to look around at other cars before I'd choose which one to ultimately purchase, but as I scanned the horizon of endless imports and American made cars alike, I came to the solid conclusion that the Impreza was it. 
I bought it.
I had driven it around cities and highways alike, but I knew I really needed to test this vehicle, understand its capabilities, so I took it to the Colorado back-country in winter. Words cannot explain my amazement at the nimbleness of this vehicle off-roading. No wonder it's a rally car extrordinare. 
My ONLY complaint about its off-roading capabilities is the ground clearance, foresaking practicality for aesthetics. Oh well, it still looks damn good.
