            I bought a used (1995) Sportage to replace my Sephia, which was totaled in a freeway accident.  I call it &quot;El Huevo&quot; because it's white and looks like an egg.  Anyway, I love Kias.  I am really hard on my car, commuting 60-80 miles daily (and thats 6-7 days a week!).  Although with recent gas prices I could wish for al little more fuel effiency, I am happy with my car.  I bought it used, so it does have a few problems, all of which have been repaired promptly by my dealer, which was kind enough to throw in a 2 year 20,000 mile warranty when I bought the car.  I love that the vehicle comes loaded with all kinds of goodies -- power door locks were a must for me.  Mine also has the power windows, cruise control, fog lamps, full-size spare, roof rack, and tow hitch!  Not a bad package for 7 grand :o).  Driving is great.  The car is big enough that I feel safe (and I like being up high) but small enough not to feel like a truck.  My mother drives a Geo Tracker and I can't stand the way it feels like tinfoil.  Not this car, this feels like a solid car made from real metal.  
I think that the biggest drwaback to this vehicle is finding someone to repair it when something wears out.  Many shops cannot hadle Kias, and if you don't have a dealer near you, you may have trouble.  When the CV boots on my Sephia went (told you I was hard on my cars), it took them 3 days to repair it because they couldn't get the car apart.  
Still, I think that Kia's slogan &quot;It's about time everyone had a well made car&quot;.  is apt.  Thank you Kia!<br><br>
