            The Dodge Neon is what I consider one of the best compact super saver cars.  The Neon has a more stylish and sporty shape than its previous model.  The interior is more well balanced and very easy to use.  The previous Neon had some problems with it's powertrain and road noises, which happens with a newly developed car.  The new 2000 Neon has remedies for all these problems that the Dodge engineers prescribed.  The ES model is realtively nice with 132 horses and a DOHC four cylinder eingine.  
Also the ES comes loaded with goodies: air conditioning, foglamps, power group, keyless remote, bigger tires, CD sound system, ABS brakes, and alloys.  That balance of items with its price tag of $16,460 is relatively nice for the super saver.  However, you can get the base Neon of course at a nifty $12,460.<br><br>
