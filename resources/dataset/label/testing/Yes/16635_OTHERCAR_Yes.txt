            We purchased this car due to it's affordability, sporty good looks and great fuel savings. With a rocky start in the vehicle industry, Hyundai has come a long way, and now provides vehicles which compare to many other leading Japanese makes. It's warranty is by far one of the best in the industry as well. With this reason and a monthly payment which is half of any other comparable Japanese car, our decision was pretty easy.

The performance of this car was surprisingly good. With both of us and our "5" dogs, the car still had plenty of pickup power. Horsepower is provided by the GSi's 1.6 l engine. This engine combined with the GSi's small size allows a person to have plenty of torque left over to pass that stubborn semi truck. I have noticed that shifting tends to be a bit cluncky in all five gears. The dealership has explained to us this 'cluncky' feeling is due to our cold Canadian weather(-15C/+5F). They switched our tranny fluid with a synthetic version (at our cost!), and said this would help. To date, I've noticed no huge change and may take this further for warranty if it continues into the summer.

Standard details that set the GSi apart are the dual fog lights, the rear spoiler, CD player, central door locks, sport tuned suspension, sunroof, and P185/60R-14 aluminum alloy wheels. The tires supplied tend to spin out easily when shifting in snowy conditions. Options that are not standard are air conditioning and cruise control. A/C is a dealer installed option but the cruise would have to be an aftermarket version. The white faced instrument panel and leather wrapped steering wheel really give you the feel your driving a euro-sporty car. 

No huge problems have arose from the Accent GSi yet. The only real small problem is the location of the cup holder. With many Java drinking people, this feature gets used quite abit. When placing your cups in the slots, it blocks all of the heating and fan controls. Another option I would have liked to see is a on/off switch for the drivers airbag. My girlfriend who is small, requires the seat to be all the way forward towards the steering wheel. This situation could prove very hazardous to her due to the proximity of the airbag to herself.

The handling of this car is to be matched with any other sporty car. The stiffer suspension along with the wide tires eliminate any sway or rock when taking corners at high speeds. 

The Accents interior is quite roomy. Myself at 6'1" had no problem stretching my legs out when riding as a passenger or driving. The fold down back seats allow a huge area for the "5" dogs to hang out or pack in bags of groceries. The 3 door hatchback version of the Accent GSi still allows passengers to get into the back seats with ease.
