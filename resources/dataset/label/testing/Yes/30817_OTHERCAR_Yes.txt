            The Olympus Camedia D-340R camera is my first digital camera.  My overall experience with this camera has been very good.  I was given the camera as a Christmas present for Christmas of 1999.  It was very easy to learn to use. I did run into a problem when I got ready to hook it up to my computer.  I didn't have an available serial port, of course that is not to be blamed on the camera but is something you would need to check before buying a digital camera.  I solved my problem by buying a FlashPath disk. I have really enjoyed taking pictures, uploading them to Ofoto, and sharing them with family and friends. It was a pleasant surprise when I got may first order of prints, the print quality was better than the pictures on the computer appeared to be. I am also able to hook this camera to a TV and show the pictures on the TV.  The required cable was included with the camera.  The camera is light weight and easy to hold which is a big plus since I have arthritis in my hands. The only draw back to this camera, in my opinion, is that it does not have a zoom.  The zoom feature is my number one want for my next digital camera.
