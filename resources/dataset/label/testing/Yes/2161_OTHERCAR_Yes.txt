            I wasn't even really in a market for a Rodeo when this one just sort of fell into my lap.  I had told my friend a couple of years before that if she ever decided to sell her Rodeo though, to keep me in mind (since I knew her driving patterns, maintenance, etc...she bought it new off the dealer lot).  So she decided to sell and I said I'd take it without even driving it (I actually test drove it the next day).  And the rest is history...

I had never driven an SUV or truck for that matter on a regular basis, so it did take some getting used to.  But once I did, I quite enjoyed the higher perspective and the truck-like feel when driving.  Any SUV such as this one is based on a truck, therefore should be driven thusly...don't get one of these if you want to drive it just like a car...try the Subaru Outback or Lexus RX-300 instead, which are based on cars.  

And for the nitty gritty...

PROS:  I love how this truck looks!  With the LS two-tone paint, it doesn't look as plain-jane as the other models.  The alloy rims give it more of a sporty look.  And the fenders all flare out slightly giving it a nice aggressive stance.  Driving is a pleasure with a very well matched v-6 engine and a very smooth shifting automatic transmission.  This tranny seems to be able to sense how hard you're on the gas, cause when you're on it, it's on it, shifting at higher revolutions than normal.  When you just need to cruise around, same thing, as easy as you are on the gas.  I have put nearly 100k on this car since i purchased it 4 years ago and I have only done some maintenance items on it such as:

-starter (@90k)
-timing belt (@100k)
-water pump (@100k)
-front brakes (lasted 140k!!! rears need doing now)
-synthetic oil changes every 5k

CONS:  The only negative things I can say about this car are just fluff...nothing to do with performance or quality.  The paint has become hazy in the hot South Florida sun, which does happen to any car down here.  The tiny 5" speakers have a hard time pumping enough sound to the entire vehicle (I upgraded to a pair of Polk Audio speakers from Crutchfield.com and they sound alot better than the stock ones), but I still need to extra boost of a subwoofer.  They do sound good with the very nice stock sound system (premium system with cassette and cd).  

Sadly, since my good ole Rodeo is getting up in mileage, I am looking at other vehicles, but this one impressed me so much I am looking at the 97 Rodeo (last year for this, my favorite, bodystyle).  So I may say goodbye soon, but I have nothing but fond memories.
