            We bought the Sony MVC-FD71 for a few reasons. The first being the same as most familes....pictures that are esaily sent to distant relatives through email. For this reason the camera is great. It is fairly light and my hubby can hold it and take a pic one handed, but I require both hands. The pictures have come out clear and this camera is easy for even me to figure out how to use. 
The second reason we bought this camera was to start dabbling in Ebay. We wanted a camera that would take nice clear pictures but not cost us an arm and a leg. We got a good deal on the camera from an area store(good for the time)! It took us a while of practicing with the camera to get good. Now we have done over 700+ auctions on ebay and are still using the same camera. 
We do have a few things that we wish were different. The first thing is that it doesn't hold a lot of pictures before you have to unload a disk. Which can be a pain to carry around multiple disks to the kids party, we always take more then 15-20 pictures which is all it seems to hold. The pictures come out pretty clear but not crystal clear. The other big problem we have with the camera is that the battery that comes with it is very short lasting, only up to 2 hours. It is nice that it is rechargable but we just bought a second battery for 59.99 and that one is so much nicer and lasts 4+ hours. So prepare to put out a little more money if you want to make sure to always have access to a charged camera.

This camera has been a great asset to both our family and our buisness. We do not plan on changing cameras anytime soon. This camera has been very dependable and has taken some great pictures. I would recomend this camera but would also advise a buyer to look around and make sure that this camera suits all your needs. The picture space would be a big thing you should consider with this camera.
