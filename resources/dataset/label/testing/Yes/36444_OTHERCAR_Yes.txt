            The new 200 Nissan Altima is totally different from the small last-year model. I test-drove the base model � 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5 S and liked the car, but not the price.

<b>Pricing</b>

Although you would have to pay <b>above MSRP</b> if you were to buy it online (carsdirect.com), I was offered a price between dealer's invoice and MSRP. In this case, it is a good value and a good car.

<b>Test Drive</b>

I decided to test drive the cheapest Altima 2.5 S, since the top-of-the-line 3.5 SE can easily cost more than $25K. There is also the "2.5 Base", but it has no air conditioning and won't fly here in California. 

As I expected, the 2.5 S� 2.5-liter 175hp engine is very flexible with 180 lb-ft of torque, which is more than some V6 engines. And the 4-cylinder has better fuel economy � by 2-3 MPG and gets 29 MPG on the highway in both auto and manual form. With 20-gallon tank it means up to 580 miles on one tank. 

The car also has a trip computer that shows, among other things, how many miles you can drive until the gas tank is empty (2.5 S with convenience package, 2.5 SL or 3.5 SE).

The sales guy (named Tom) allowed me to drive a car with manual transmission and then automatic (since I wasn't too good hanling the manual - but I didn't stall it :) ). The day was gloomy and he didn't have much customers and I had time, since my car was in the service department for 22.5K mile service.

Although at 2.5 liters this four-cylinder is the largest inline four-cylinder engine I�ve heard about being currently in production and since it�s not balanced the way inline-6 or V12 engines are, it�s supposed to vibrate significantly. The engine features balance shafts and doesn�t seem to vibrate too much, although you can feel that it�s not as smooth as V6�s, especially at the idle.

The car is very roomy inside, but visibility is not too good, especially backward visibility. The mirrors (power mirrors) are small. The dash and interior have good fit and finish, but look somewhat cheap in the light grey color. The A/C controls are located below the radio/CD player and are easy to use � they feature 3 rotating switches the same way as in my Galant.

The Altima is a front wheel drive car but I didn�t notice much torque steer. The ride is also well-controlled. With the manual transmission equipped car and the shifter and the clutch have good feel (but I saw better shifters). The gated automatic takes some getting used to, but the dash has shift indicator you can refer to.

The brakes are very good, but the brake pedal is too sensitive.

You can get the High-Intensity Discharge (Xenon) lights in the 3.5 SE version for $400, but you have to get the sunroof to get them. With 2.5 S, the ABS and side airbags are option for which you have to pay $700.

From the rear, the car can be confused for Volkswagen Passat. The trunk opening is quite low.

Base 2.5 S with manual transmission and steel wheels costs $18,750, and if you add automatic transmission, ABS and side airbags, the price is over $20K. With more options it gets to $24K and for this price you are still sitting on the cloth seats. Honda Accord costs about $1,000 less with similar equipment and new Toyota Camry costs about the same with Mitsubishi Galant ES automatic that can be bought for $17.5. 

But the Altima is much roomier and more stylish. With the front seat moved all the way back, I couldn't the clutch (I am 5'11") and there was still plenty of leg room for the rear passengers. Tom asked me to make a U-turn to show me that the car has small turning diameter, and it does indeed.

The new Altima looks good, has more power than competitors, but also costs more. This is a different approach than they had before with the previous Altima being smaller and cheaper than competitors.
