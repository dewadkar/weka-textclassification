            The Olds Alero is a great buy for someone who needs good gas milliage, but likes the tight turning and curve hugging feel of a sports car.  I've had mine for about 5 months and I love it. The four cylinder engine is surprisingly torkey and it revs out nicely.  The interior is well designed with an emphasis on operator comfort. The stock stereo is a four speaker system that is fairly clear.

Some things I didn't like so much is where they located the ash tray. It is write by the shifter and is difficult to reach. Also some of the trays and cup holders could have been built a little stronger.

All in all the alero is a great sporty car, it even preforms well in the snow, with its traction control system you never have to worry about getting stuck. The car handles extremely nice into and out of a corner, and well you going straight you hardly have to put your hands on the wheel.
