            I owned a 89 Toyota Celica with 135,000 miles on it.  My family needed a new reliable vehicle that was modestly priced but spacious enough to accommodate two adults and a toddler.

We test drove many vehicles before concluding that the Corolla was the best value for our money. 

It's a perfect car for the small family. The most important detail for us was trunk space.  The Corolla trunk has plenty of space when we travel.  it fits 2 large duffel bag suitcases and our son's pack and play.  That's for starters.  We pack big when we go on vacation.  We have diapers,cosmetic bags, loose clothes,a small cooler and a booster seat that travels with us.  The trunk fits all of our items except for the booster seat and cooler which fit nicely in the back seat next to my son.

The Corolla provides a comfortable ride on long trips but my husband and I are small people.  A larger person in stature and girth would not be as cozy. I am content riding in the back seat along with my son in his car seat. It is important to know that most car seats are not stable without a special clip. The clips are available free of charge at any dealer.
  
Reliability is very important when I travel alone with my son.  I never worry about breaking down (and never have).  I've owned a Toyota since 1980.  I've driven my cars up to 135,000 miles.  My first Toyota was sold to a friend at 100,000 miles.  He used it for another 100,000 miles.

It looks rich, drives great and is the best value out there for your dollar.  It's affordable and visually appealing for the first time car buyer and spacious enough for a small family. It's perfect as a second car for for a family of four.
