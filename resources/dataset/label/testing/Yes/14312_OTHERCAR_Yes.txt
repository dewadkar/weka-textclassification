            If you loved the Toyota Corolla 1998-2000, you should like the Sentra as well. I'm no Pro, but I'll do my best to state my opinion here. This was my first new car and I still love it. I believe in Japanese cars for compact sedans.

I chose this car for many resons. I had a psychological price limit and this one passed: CAD$ 20K or below (before taxes). I got it for 20K with Nissan Mags, automatic, GXE (all electric), AC. It was cheaper and the interests were lower than all the other models I was comparing to, at the time. Just with the interests, I would save a lot compared to the Honda Civic, a Matrix, or the overpriced Mazda 5. Would I buy it again? Yes, unless I could find a similar deal for cheaper.

Let's go with the CONS. The wheel needs to be sportier: it feels too large (diameter) as opposed to the Corolla's. Surround visibility is not as good as the Corolla's: you have to get accustomed to new distances; things look closer than they are, like when you park; the front and door axes (windows) are too thick and block your view decievingly, like when you check your dead angle. The rear doesn't look as great as the (old) Altima's. Suspention is firm, but the rear is made of one axe, so you'll feel all the wholes and bumps when driving (BUT the Corollas have a slack, jumpy-bumpy suspension). With automatic gear, shifting feels over-nervous, a bit weak and goofy, indecise. It feels like it's pushing, but it's no F1. Default tires are hard and slippery in the rain. In my Sentra, the passenger's inner door arm rest detached easily when I tried to shut the door!

PROS. Based on the previous models of the Altima. Slick front design. Acceptable inside finition. Cool and handy sunglasses door above the radio (but it doesn't fit CDs). Amazing default CD-player/sound: no skipping, top sound. AC works great in normal conditions; the fan works almost too much. Suspension is firm and acceptable in the front. Drives like a charm in all normal conditions. Not the most agressive car on the road, but it has some kick-down. Maybe not the most economic on gas, but still very acceptable; better than the 98 Corolla's. Compact yet roomy interior and trunk. Firm, comfortable seats like Japanese can do, including a multi-axe adjustment for the driver. Cool security features under the roof, air bags, breaks are very acceptable (ask your dealership for details about security). Easy to care. Motor and parts looks fine and modern.

Finally, it's a great choice if you're into this type and you think that Toyota's, Honda's and Mazda's are overpriced in a way or another. It's a great car to keep for a long while. Nissan finally got somewhere with the Sentra, Altima and Maxima.
