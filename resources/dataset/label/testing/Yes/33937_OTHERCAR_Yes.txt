            I love my car!  My husband bought it for me for our anniversary and I wouldn't have any other.  I always thought it was a cute car, but I like many thought it was unaffordable.  One weekend we were riding around and we saw one for sale at a local car dealer, so we stopped &quot;just to look.&quot;  When I saw the interior and how &quot;big&quot; it actually was inside, I fell head over heals.  And then I drove it.  They couldn't/wouldn't give us the deal we needed, but from that point forward it was an obsession.  

We had a graduation party for my daddy the following weekend, come to find out my godfather had purchased on recently for his wife and it was there...and I drove it and played in it for hours.  His is a TDI so he gets 50 miles/gallon and at the time I was commuting 60 miles/day in a 94 Honda Passport (loved it but it was a V6 gas guzzler).  So a better gas bill was strong on our minds. 
 
The following week we went to a different dealership and tried unsuccessfully to buy one.  Can I just say that the following weekend we got a better deal on a better car after a little drive and that Beetle at the other dealership is still sitting there months later. They didn't take us seriously.  Well...there is nothing that says I can't say don't buy a car from Dick Parker Ford in Havelock.  Get it from National VW in Jacksonville.  There is also something to be said about buying a VW from an authorized VW dealer.   We saw our baby on the internet.  Bought it before it had even been taken of the truck.  It is amazing.  Everything about it is complicated.  There are little nuances about everything, but the drive is worth it.  I actually get happy when I am in it.  I can have the worst day, but at the end of that day when I get in my Beetle and drive home everything is allright.  I mean what other car can you drive around and have complete strangers with the same car honking and waving...it's a cult.  And there is nothing like it. 

Everyone should have one the world would be happier place. It is very easy to get into and out of and there is plenty of room inside.  The small trunk and engine compartments give it a small appearance, but it is all interior space.  Can I just say again... I love my car!<br><br>
