            I originally bought my 1993 Ford Escort in 1994 for $8200.  It had 13k miles on it and had been a loaner car for a local dealership.  The reason I bought this car was to replace a clapped out Hyundai (the biggest mistake I'd ever made in a car purchase).

The Escort is an LX model, 4 doors with a 4 cylinder, fuel injected engine.  The transmission is an automatic.  Other options included a stereo radio with front and rear speakers and a split fold down rear seat.

First let me say that this has been an excellent car.  It is extremely reliable and has only had three repairs outside of the scope of general maintenance.  This was the replacement of an oxygen sensor at 65k miles ($350) and another oxygen sensor at 98k miles - this time a different one ($300).  The third repair was the replacement of the heater core ($325).  The first to repairs were done by a dealership, the last by a local mechanic... so the heater core replacement would probably be closer to $425 at a dealership.

The next repair on the horizon is new front and rear struts... again, I classify this as maintenance - not a flaw in the car.

The only expensive repair that is part of the car's general maintenance is the replacement of a timing belt at 60k miles - $500.  This is a must.... but you should still know about it.

One thing I've noticed about the car is that it has an odd tire size that is not always available, particularly in the cheaper tire versions.  The car is also a little tough on front tires, although someone told me front wheel drive cars have a tendency towards this.

The fit and finish is great for a car of this type.  It's noisy and it has some squeeks, but what can you expect from an econobox.  The seating is a little hard, but offers plenty of support.  In fact, I find the drivers seat to be MORE comfortable for long drives than my Thunderbird.

The paint job has held up well (we keep it under a carport, which helps).

I fully expect to drive this car to 150k plus miles.  If you are looking for good, cheap, reliable transportation this car would be a likely choice.  If you look around, you should be able to find one at an extremely affordable price.  I might suggest using CARFAX.COM to check on the car before purchasing it.
