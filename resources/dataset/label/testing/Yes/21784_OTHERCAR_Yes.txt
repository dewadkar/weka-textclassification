            Back in the beginning of 98, the lease on my 97 Nissan truck ran out and I was in the market for a new car. I was already at the dealership so I started checking out Nissans line up.. I wanted a coupe, so the 200sx was looking really apealling. After doing a little reseach on the Internet, I fell in love with the Honda Civic. I'm into customizing my car, and the Honda Civic had hundred of options. I love the style of the body, and the ride is great. Honda has a great reputation for reliablity, and the gas miliage is awesome. I hope to keep this car for a long time. Even after it's paid off. I think this car is great for young adults. It is roomy enough for all your friends, and affordable so you'll have money left over to party... It's the best of every option. I love my Civic!<br><br>
