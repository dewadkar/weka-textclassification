            The first Honda that I ever purchased was a Prelude, back in 1992 or so. It was one of the most problem-free cars I've owned. When it came time to buy another car in 1997 I decided to head back to the Honda dealership. I really liked the looks and style of the Civic EX, and the price was great, with most of the &quot;options&quot; I wanted coming as &quot;standard&quot; equipment.

One small complaint on design. I felt that the CD player option was overpriced, but replacing the radio with a CD player effectively kills the keyless remote! You can either add a CD player and leave this otherwise unused radio dangling inside the dashboard, do without the keyless remote, or do without a CD player. I reluctantly chose the later.

The keyless-remote entry is more than a convenience in a state like Florida where an afternoon monsoon can pop up without warning. You can easily drown in the few extra seconds it can take to unlock a car manually. In four years of use, I've only had to replace the battery once. The only flaw I've had with this car is with the manual portion of the door locks. Intermittently the manual lock on the driver's side will &quot;hang&quot; and refuse to lock. Reaching over another few inches I can use the electric switch and it locks fine, so it's not a major inconvenience, just not right. The dealership has been unable to find a problem, but replaced the assembly once. The problem returned 6 months later.

The car still handles well after all this time, and the peppy VTEC engine gets into the flow of interstate traffic with ease. It's a fun car to drive, and the moon-roof is a nice touch during the few days a year that the Florida weather allows driving without the a/c turned on.

I wouldn't recommend the backseat for anyone over the age of 5. You can wedge an adult back there if they have short legs, or don't mind sitting sideways, but I wouldn't really recommend it.

It's a great entry-level car with enough excitement to keep even more jaded drivers happy.<br><br>
