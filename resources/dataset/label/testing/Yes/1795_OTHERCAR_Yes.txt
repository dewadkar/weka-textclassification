            Well, I have given my raves about my 2 Hondas, I figured that I also need to get my opinion in on the Oldsmobile as well. While my experience with the 90's and up Olds is slim to none, I can tell you that Oldsmobile is a name that will last.

I own a 1969 Olds with a 1970 rocket 350 in it. I bought the car about 3 years ago. It was stripped and primered and there was pretty much nothing but a shell of a car. I bought it though because for a 69 the rust was hardly anything on the body. There was a little cancer behind all 4 wheels, but for being 31 years old, this is TERRIFIC! The floorboards were solid and everything else about the car was solid.

I rebuilt the 70 rocket because the engine was in parts in the trunk. The guy I bought it from said that the engine had over 130,000 miles on it. I was VERY suprised to find that the engine was in great shape! The pistons barely had a mark on them and the cylinders hardly had a ridge around the top. I was very impressed! Very pleased to since I knew that I could reuse the old pistons. That saved me some money. 

After about a year of rebuilding, the car was back on the road. I loved it! It turned heads, it drove like a dream, and with the rocket under the hood, it made the mass of steal get up and move. I've put 14,000 miles on it since the rebuild and not one flaw yet. 

Except for the accident. :-( A woman failed to yield when making a left hand turn and turned right in front of me. Smucked up the front pretty good but the car still drove home. 

If you want to see the car in question and my other 2 Hondas, you can check my site out at http://www.angelfire.com/nd/RockMan I think that you will agree also that my Oldsmobile has come a long way.<br><br>
