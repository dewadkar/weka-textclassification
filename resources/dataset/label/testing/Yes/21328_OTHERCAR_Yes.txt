            We leased our '99 Camry XLE in May and love it!  
After coming from a car that was terribly unreliable (even though it was a '97 model), disgusting on gas mileage and handled terribly, any car would have been a welcomed change. However, we were unprepared for just how great this car is. Gas mileage, in town, runs about 18, on the highway around 25. Handles like a dream so far, although the real test will come when we have a snow storm. 
My insurance went up $2 a year (yes two dollars a year) because, according to my agent), the car is &quot;safer&quot;. The XLE has not only a pass. side airbag, but also side impact bags, which was what sold us on the Camry vs. an Accord.  I've been to the dealer once, for an oil change in the six months I've had the car. 
The inside is very roomy and because it's an XLE, all leather trim. Very nice, Very luxurious, although not one of our necessities. The trunk is deceptively large.  It looks so tiny, until it's opened. The seats also fold down if you need even more room. (60-40 split.) Also came with a sun roof and CD player, and electronic everything, right down the the levels to change seat positions. You can even move the seats up and down, not only back and forth, a plus for those of us with short legs. Also came with an alarm, but not one of those that goes off when the breeze blows the wrong way. There is no mercury swith so it doesn't false trigger.  There is a sensor in the driver's seat that senses weight. If there is no weight on the seat, you can not lock the car with the keys in the ignition.
Price, while high, was not out of line for this size car. However, we leased for four years. The lease agreement with Toyota was very easy to understand. And our dealer (sales, finance and service) have been great.<br><br>
