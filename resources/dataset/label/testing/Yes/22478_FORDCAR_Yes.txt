            After 24 months driving my Ford Ranger XLT,there are several impressions :
I actually use this vehicle for weekend travel,since we love mountains, many times we pack some essential items and go on the road. At this point,let me say that there is almost no space inside the truck,unless you carry a lunch box,you have to put all your stuff at the back (if you do not have any storage device for this purpose forget this option during rainy days ).If your are not carrying anything else,the truck is really fun to drive. Seats are comfortable:our version has individual seats so you can adjust the way you like(but remember this is a truck not a car so the term "comfortable" applies only to truck comparisons).My red truck came with a "California package":  bed with bumpers exposed,power windows,air conditioning,automatic transmission, radio cassette player,tinted windows,sliding back window and sport wheels,all this extras create a very sporty and attractive look and also provide additional comfort for long trips, but, what about performance?.
Certainly the main disadvantage of this truck is power ...even with a six cylinder engine going uphill makes you think that the truck is loaded with 1000 pounds (and you only loaded your lunch box !!)I suppose that those Ford guys think that this truck is not a sports car,but when you figure out fuel consumption,power and vehicle weight,there is something wrong about design. About craftsmanship,well,there are some noises here some rattles there, but in general the truck feels sturdy and reliable.So if you requirements are only fun and you are a single guy or your  family is small (no more than two!)buy this vehicle.If you are looking for a heavy duty truck  for cargo purposes this is not your best choice.
