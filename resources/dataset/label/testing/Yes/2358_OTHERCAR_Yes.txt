            I did extensive research prior to purchase of this camera. This one really had the others beat in most respects. It may not have the best image and resolution of all the digitals, although it's hard to tell when you don't see how the others turn out. I did use the comparometer at www.imaging-resource.com/IMCOMP/COMPS01.HTM to see how the images from various cameras stack up with each other. I found this to be a little misleading, however. When I saw the pictures on the web site compared to what I found by taking some shots with various cameras, I found the web images to be somewhat inaccurate in some instances. For example the low-end, under $300 HP's look good on the web site, but I found the actual photos to be extremely grainy in appearance. The Toshiba photos on the web site were fairly accurate. This camera has never given a grainy appearance to any photos I have taken. The resolution seems a little less crisp than some I saw on the web site, but I don't know to what extent I should trust the web images. Overall the features in this camera are excellent. It has a very solid body, and gives the feel of a much more expensive metallic camera. So many of the digitals have a plastic feel about them. The USB cable allows extremely fast downloads from camera to computer - perhaps the fastest available. The camera resets in 2 seconds for the next shot - one of the fastest resets available. There are many possible adjustments for those who wish to make the camera work in the non-automatic mode. Personally, I don't have the time to do that, and the automatic mode works great for me. The camera battery can be charged within the camera with an AC adapter cord that comes with the camera, thereby eliminating a cost which must be incurred when purchasing most other brands (usually $45-75 dollars additional for AC adapters). The viewfinder is large and fairly accurate in replicating actual shots. The only drawback I have experienced is a lack of an optical zoom; however, the cost of this feature in other brands seems to raise the price about $100 or more. For the wannabe professional, this might be worthwhile. For the average photographer (like myself) it simply isn't worth the additional cost. I paid $279 for the PDR-M4, and I consider that a bargain compared to other brands I looked at, especially when you factor in the added cost of the AC adapter with other brands.
