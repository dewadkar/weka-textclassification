            This vehicle is a replacement to a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport (See epinion review).  I totaled the 1999 in November.  Let me tell you one thing, the 1999 fell apart in the accident.  I walked away with 3 broken ribs.  If you could have seen the truck you would wonder how I am writing this epinion.  I wouldn't buy anything else after that accident and walking away.  Well anyways on to the 2001. This one isn't as fully loaded as my first one.  I am very happy to not have leather seats.  The cloth seats are much more comfortable in the cold weather.  I am very pleased with the way this truck handles and with 10 more horse power it makes going up hills a lot easier and you don't hear the engine &quot;kick in&quot;.  One major pet peeve I had about the 99 was the seatbelts didn't retract.  Well Ford got that little bug worked out with this one.  However, Ford hasn't worked on the gas mileage problem yet.  I am getting approx. 300 miles to a tank (17.5 gal tank)the same as the 1999.  All in all I am happy with this vehicle (they still have Firestone tires on them unless you pay extra).  It has new body features that make it look a little more &quot;tough&quot;. The Ford Explorer will always be the one for me!<br><br>
