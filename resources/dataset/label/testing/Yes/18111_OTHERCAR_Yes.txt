            A few years ago my Dad decided to replace the 1987 Dodge Omni my mother and him used as a second car to their 1991 Ford Aerostar. Despite the Omni's spotty reputation and ugly-as-sin appearance, it had served them well with over 135K on the odometer. My father looked at several cars, including a used Acura Legend before settling on a new 1997 Mercury Mystique.

Dad purchased the car in June for about $14,500. It is white with a dark blue cloth interior, cast aluminum wheels, and loaded with just about everything but a sunroof. Unfortunately Dad settled for the 2.0 liter inline four since he was always concerned about fuel economy. He should've considered the 2.5 liter V-6 with its 170 hp that would've made this little car quite a rocket. The transmission is a 4-speed automatic. I believe a 5-speed manual was available, but Mom would've shared this car with him and she can't drive a stick.

What do I like about this car? It's attractive for a little car and has just about everything my Cadillac has - power windows, power door locks, seats, CD and cassette stereo, courtesy lights galore and the nice feature of the interior lights being activated by a tug on the door handles. The four cylinder powerplant is not really a slouch and the car actually seems to be fun to drive. 

My Mom is afraid of driving and, because of this, always took jobs very close to home. Since Dad bought the Mystique, she isn't afraid to make a 10 mile commute to her job each morning and actually seems to enjoy it. That speaks volumes about the Mystique as far as I'm concerned.

What I don't like is that, similar to my girlfriend's Tracer, it seems to be cramped up front and the shifter console seems to be too close to the driver's right leg. Some of the controls are confusing and it takes some time to get familiar with them. Also, I don't know who supplied the tires for the Mystique, but they were always blowing out on the right front wheel (at least 3 times). I've been driving for nearly 20 years and have never experienced a blow out on worn tires let alone new ones.

This is just my perception, but I think the Mystique has an image problem. Despite being a vastly superior replacement to the mediocre Tempo and Topaz,I still can't help but think of the Ford twins (Contour, Mystique) as the modern version of those dumpy cars.

To summarize, I think the Mystique is a very nice smaller car with a lot of amenities for those who don't have too big an ego.<br><br>
