            My friend Don is in the market to replace his RAV4 that has been driving him around for the past couple of years.  He asked me if I wanted take a test drive with him yesterday at the dealer for a new RAV4.  I said yes, but did not want to make it a long Friday night haggling with the salesman.

My first impression of the new RAV4 and Don's old RAV4 is that the exterior looks slightly larger and more powerful. According to the salesman, only an inch and a half longer and about an inch taller.  The wheelbase has been extended three inches, which I immediately noticed in the better handling of the drive.  The two-liter 148 horsepower engine felt peppy when stepping on the gas, but it did take almost 10 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph.  The salesman also said the new RAV4 is more than 100 pounds heavier than Don's older model.  The gas mileage is about 23 - 27 miles to the gallon, which is less than Don's older model.

The RAV4 is available in a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.

The interior is like night and day over Don's older model.  It is more modern looking with a very high-tech look.  Don's back fell in love with the optional leather seats on the RAV4 that we test drove.  There are plenty of storage compartments on the front storage console and pockets in all four doors and either side of the rear cargo area.  The sounds of the standard six-speaker stereo system is very respectable.

I was very impressed with the improvement in the drive, looks, and comfort of the new RAV4.
