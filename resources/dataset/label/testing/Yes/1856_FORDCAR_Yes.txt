            We bought this used van because our Plymouth Grand Voyager had finally gone kerplunk, and we needed something quick.

Priced at under $10K, with immaculate interior, this full size van was hard to pass up.

I have to admit, I was a little intimidated at first by it's size.  I wasn't too keen on driving a full size van.  I was afraid I'd hit something by backing into it.

After getting used to the wobbly steering, this van won me over heart and soul.  I feel safer in this larger vehicle, and the semi-drivers no longer intimidate me.  It's nice to be able to see over the guard rails as I'm passing by them.  Gee...I never knew there was a lake over there!

The one problem I do have, is that I have many blind spots.  There are curtains all over the vehicle, but even with them all open I still have some sight problems.

We have plenty of room in this van.  We are a family of 6, with a 2 1/2 year old, so room is a necessity.  We even have room for one more child :).

We bought this van in excellent condition, with 69,000 miles on it for $9,999.  It runs like a dream, starts every morning, and the interior was well taken care of.  The family/person who owned this van prior to us took very good care of it.

Unfortunately, with the price of gas these days, it takes over $50 to fill up my tank.  I only get about 11 miles to the gallon. But I can live with the cost of filling up the tank as long as she does me good. 

If you're in the market for a used van, I suggest you check into this one.  If you can find one that was as well maintained as ours, you've got yourself a van!
