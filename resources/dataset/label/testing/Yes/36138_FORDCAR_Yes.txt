            I recently purchased the Ford Focus 2000 ZX3 Kona edition. In short, this is a great car that I would highly recommend. 

I bought this car and particular model for a number of reasons:

-	Ride: The car ride is extremely refined and smooth for a car in its price range. Although I might not go as far as holding a very full cup of coffee over railroad tracks as the Focus commercial may show, the ride is nonetheless very pleasant.

-	Noise: Other than heavy acceleration while climbing steep hills, the Focus does an excellent job of reducing the various noises of a daily commute. If you do plan to do lots of travel in hilly territory, expect a rather loud experience from time to time. On the same road for example, my Chevy Prism is quieter than the Focus (for engine noise specifically).

-	Size: These days, many cars have cavernous trunks. However, many still cannot fit a large TV or such in the back. The Kona edition is the hatchback model, and offers a very large trunk space with the fold down seats and removable trunk cover (large enough with a bit of maneuvering for a 7ft ladder!).

-	Value: The Focus is a great car. Although it does have somewhat a higher of a price tag than some of its counterparts, I believe that the extra money I paid was worth it.

-	Appearance: The Kona edition is a �handsome� car. I�ve noticed a lot of people looking at the back to figure out what kind of car it is. (I�ve owned many interesting / fancy cars in the past and never had that happen before!)

-	Safety: The Kona edition is very loaded, as it includes such niceties as power windows/door locks, side air bags, air, CD player, cruise control, and remote keyless entry. 

Overall, I�m extremely happy with the car. I�d easily recommend it to anyone looking for an relatively inexpensive well designed car.
