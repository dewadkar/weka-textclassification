            I have always wanted a convertible, and decided on the 2001 SLK 320. Mercedes-Benz has always had a reputation for excellent customer service, and safety. These factors contributed greatly, to my decision.

There are many new features for the 2001 SLK Class, as well as the 2001 SLK 320. The Mercedes-Benz web-site lists all of these new features, and more..

One of the most attractive features, of this car, is its' retractable hard-top. It retracts in less than 30 seconds, and requires no handling. All that is required, is the flip of a button. The wood trim comes standard, with the 2001 SLK 320, and has a very elegant look, as well as the aluminum alloy, 5-spoke wheels.

The 215hp, 3.2L V-6 engine can take you, from 0-60 mph, in 6.6 seconds!! Whenever I need to get up and go, this car takes me there. The Tele Aid system is a super plus!! It uses GPS satellites and a cellular link that provides 24-hour contact with Mercedes-Benz for information, Roadside Assistance, and emergencies. 

One of the things that has taken time to adjust to, is the gas tank. Unlike other, older cars, the gas tank is environmentally safe... You cannot put the gas nozzle in, and throttle it open.. Instead, you must ensure that the nozzle is completely in, and then slowly open the throttle.. The is a change from my other car. Also, there is a small blind-spot, on the drivers side, when the top is up.

Driving this vehicle is a pleasure. I am now finding excuses, to go places, just so I can drive it!! The seats are extremely comfortable, and relaxing.

I am not going to say who should, or should not purchase this vehicle.. It is a personal decision, that should be made by each individual.. However, if you enjoy a fast, and exciting driving experience, then you might want to test-drive this car..<br><br>
