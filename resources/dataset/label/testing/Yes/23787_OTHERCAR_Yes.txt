            If your priorities in buying a car are fuel economy, price, reliability and comfort, then you will find my review useful. I will not tell you whether the car is attractive or not because I think that is your decision to make. Also, I leave it to you to decide whether the crash test statistics are acceptable to you.

<b>MY CAR:</b>
I have a metallic green, 4-door Echo with an automatic transmission (not my first choice), air conditioning, and a few cosmetic extras. I purchased it in May of 2000. The other car I was seriously considering was a Ford Focus. I do most of my driving on city streets.

<b>FUEL ECONOMY</b>
I chose a small car because I cannot avoid using a car where I live, but I want to use less gasoline to do my part to reduce emissions and also to save money. I had initially wanted a manual transmission because I am used to them and they are slightly more fuel-efficient, but there were none on the lot. As it happens, this automatic gets in the low 30s for city driving and in the low 40s on the highway. I have a short commute (5 miles one way), and with the regular errands I run, I fill the tank once every three weeks. 

One of the main reasons we did not go with a Ford Focus is that it gets lower mileage (surprisingly low, I thought). The engine they use in that car is not particularly new and can definitely stand to be redesigned.

<b>PRICE</b>
I am leasing my Echo because I didn't have enough of a down payment to make a loan feasible at the time. We plan to buy this car at the end of the lease and are saving up. I came to the dealership armed with the Consumer Reports New Car Service fax, but ended up paying MSRP anyway. I am not a good bargainer, and there were only 3 of these in town at the time. As summer approached and I needed air conditioning, I made a quick decision. I didn't regret it.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>
If you are looking at Toyotas, then you probably already know that they are pretty reliable. I have had no (repeat NO) problems with this car. We change the oil on schedule and check the tires frequently. Nothing has gone wrong, but I realize that I've only been driving it a year.

<b>COMFORT</b>
The seats in this car work well for me (I'm 5' 4") and for my husband (6'). We are pretty slim people, so I can't say how comfortable the seats would be for someone larger. The lumbar support on the front seats makes long drives very comfortable for us. Also, the driver seat goes back far enough to make my long-legged husband feel like he is in a bigger car. The Focus did not go back far enough.

The back seats are, well, adequate. It is a bench seat and pretty flat. You sit a bit higher in the back and have a good view out all the windows. The headrests on all seats are also a plus for sleeping in the car and avoiding serious neck injuries in fender-benders (haven't had one yet, knock on wood).

The entire car is tall and that makes getting in and out very easy. When I was 9 months pregnant, I almost became trapped in my friend's Chevy Cavalier because the seats are SO low. The Echo is quite easy to get in and out of. Also, the higher seats improves your view of the road, especially with all these large SUVs out there.

<b>OTHER FEATURES I LIKE</b>
There are a few other things about this car that I really like. The drawer under the passenger seat is particularly useful. We keep our user's manual in there so the glove compartment can be freed up for other things. Also, the underseat drawer is great for putting things out of sight when you lock the car.

The many open compartments in the front of the car should not be used for anything that might fly up and hurt you during a collision. They are great for things like umbrellas, sunglasses, and gloves and other things that you take back and forth on trips.

The speedometer and other controls are mounted in the center of the dash. I find it easier to read them without taking my eyes off the road, but it did take some getting used to. The white dials are also very easy to read at night.

The radio controls are very easy to operate. The buttons and readout are big.

<b>THE DOWNSIDE</b>
I am not blind to the faults of this car. First, the interior paneling is made of cheap plastic that is very easy to scuff. The marks don't buff out.

Also, the trunk sill is very easy to scratch when you take things in and out (such as laundry baskets). I know it's inside the trunk, but it bugs me that it's scratched.

The bumpers (as with all new cars these days) are easy to scuff and wouldn't take up much of the shock of a fender-bender, let alone a big accident.

The back seat is short (a consequence of it being a small car), and some infant car seats simply will not fit unless you move the front seats way up. Also, the center lap belt (a nice feature otherwise), cuts into the back seat when you have a car seat installed and leaves a permanent dent.

The car weighs about a ton (literally). The Focus is 500 pounds or so heavier. The light weight of the Echo is an asset as far as fuel consumption goes, but it can make it more dangerous in wet or icy conditions. I live in the desert. This car may not be a good choice if you drive in bad weather a lot. Also, if you get hit by any other car, it WILL be heavier. Guess who wins?

The road noise on this car could be better.

If you choose a used 2000 Echo or a new one, be sure to get a clock. It is a feature I really miss. 

<b>IN SUM</b>
I love my Echo. I enjoy driving it and I believe it is reliable. It is also comfortable, and (I think) kind of cool. Best of all, I don't worry much about fluctuations in the price of gasoline. If this sounds good to you, take this car for a test drive and see what you think.
