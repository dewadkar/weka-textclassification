Volkswagen's new Jetta is a solid, well-finished car at a very reasonable price.  Everything about this car smacks of teutonic solidity -- the doors close with a thud, not a rattle, and the interior is finished with materials and textures that you usually find only in much more expensive cars.  It's got a big trunk

It's also reasonably fun to drive, although VW's advertising makes a bit too much of its sporting ability.  There is a certain germanic firmness to the suspension, but one also finds a lot of body roll when cornering hard.  The standard engine (the 4 cylinder) is also a bit pokey.  Spending the extra money for the VR6 more than solves that problem -- the more powerful jetta is quite fast, solid, and quiet on the highway.  The VR6 model is pretty expensive -- in the low $20s -- but if you're more concerned with performance than cost, it could be worth it.

The best buy for the jetta, though, may be the TDi -- the turbodiesel model.  It gets great mileage; 40+ miles to the gallon isn't uncommon, and if it weren't for the little TDi badge on the rear, you'd never know.  The turbodiesel also feels more in keeping with the mission of the car.

Overall, the Jetta is more solid than fun to drive.  Have a look at the turbodiesel model -- they're really reliable, and nothing can beat their fuel economy.  Other cars, like the Acura Integra and Ford Contour, are more fun to drive, but they don't feel anywhere near as solid as this Jetta, and their interiors feel substantially cheaper.<br>
