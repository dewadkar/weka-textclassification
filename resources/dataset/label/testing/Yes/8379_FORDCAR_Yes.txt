            Love my Explorer.  Once this one croaks we are getting another.  We have a small son and if you have children you know the paraphernalia that accumulates as soon as they are born.  Our Explorer accommodates his stuff and I can still stop buy and get a weeks worth of groceries.  Space is very important when you are talking about a family car.  Nothing is worse than being on the road with cramped cranky family members.  My only complaint is the front bucket seat is not comfortable to sleep in - reclining issues.

The features are great even thought we have an older model I don't feel like our SUV is outdated by any means.  We are starting to notice some signs of age but so far we have had minimal problems with our Explorer and even then it was wear and tear issues.  I highly recommend it to sporty type, family, and dog lovers.  We are all three and once you have one you can't go back to anything else.  But I could go to the Expedition!  Probably not, too much of a gas guzzler for this pocket.<br><br>
