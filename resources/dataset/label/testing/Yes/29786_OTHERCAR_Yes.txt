            My girlfriend purchased a used 1991 Mercury Tracer six years ago. Her car is a medium orange-red with a gray cloth interior.  It is powered by the 1.8 Litre transverse in-line four mated to a 4 speed automatic transmission.

Similar to the Ford Escort, it is a fairly attractive. It sort of looks like a shrunken Mercury Sable. However,you can't expect Lexus-quality build and materials in a car on the low end of the price spectrum.

The interior is a mix of cloth and heavy plastic with a rather uninspired dashboard. For a small economy car, it has a lot of features such as power windows and power door locks. The air conditioner is excellent. 

The car is great for smaller people. My girlfriend is only 5'1&quot; and 107lbs. and sits with the drivers seat almost up to the steering wheel. Her previous car was a Chevrolet Sprint, (precursor to the Geo Metro). Taller, bigger people, such as myself would find it rather cramped unless the seat is all the way back.  

The car seems fairly reliable since she travels 12 miles one way each day to her job. However, as the car ages, little things and some big things seem to have plagued this little car.  Two years ago she had to replace the transmission at a rather steep cost of $1,500. Last February, her car had to be towed from my driveway because the Ford anti-theft system went awry and the car couldn't be started. Numerous electrical problems have disabled her power door locks and the factory stereo is on the fritz.  Now the car needs a new serpentine belt tensioner and rear struts. 

The paint finish is in deplorable condition - fading, peeling and cracking everywhere. The rubber door sill trim has dry rotted necessitating replacement of the piece on right front door. The cost of this piece is $53.
 
I wouldn't say her car is unsalvageable. Attention to the little things and a new paint job would do wonders for it. She has maintained it well and the interior is in excellent shape, but the car has 95K on the odometer and has a blue book value of around $1,500.  The car is very easy to work on and would be ideal for the weekend mechanic who likes to tinker. 

Despite its numerous flaws, I believe the Tracer would be an great car for teens, students or those on a very tight budget. My girlfriend  is seriously considering an upgrade to a new Chevrolet Impala, but it would be nice if she could keep the Tracer as a runabout. <br><br>
