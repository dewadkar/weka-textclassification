            My husband and I own a 1998 Chevy S-10 extended cab with the ZR2 package. We have taken many off road adventures in this truck! Living in a snowy area, I often drive it as the snow is falling. I have yet to have a problem with the anti-lock brake system or with the 4x4 feature of the truck. On that note, it is a great dependable car!

The only real problems we have had with this vehicle have been known manufacturer defects. One problem we have is with the driver's side mirror. It vibrates at speeds over 50 mph. We have had it replaced twice and still have the same problem! After our 3rd trip to the dealer, we finally spoke with the service manager and were told that this is a KNOWN defect and that Chevy is working on a fix for it. However, at this time we just had to deal with it. We were pleased to hear that Chevy knew about the problem but were miffed with the original dealer who replaced it twice instead of investigating the problem. So...long story, short...if you have a Chevy S10 and the driver side mirror vibrates at higher speeds, they know and there is nada they can do about it.

Overall, we do like the truck and it is dependable. It performs well in the mountains..both on road and off. The ZR2 package is great as it gives you a little bit more lift and a more stable ride.
