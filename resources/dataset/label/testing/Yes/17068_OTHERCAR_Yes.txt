            I bought a used Audi A6 6 months ago form a VW AUDI dealership. Here is how it went...
I was considering buying either a new 4 cylinder Passat for my wife or a used more luxuarious and powerful car such as a BMW 528, Lexus,etc..I drive a Eddie Bauer Expedition and my wife had a 98 Mustang. Space is at the premium in that car! We are becoming parents for the second time so.. So here we were on my way to VW dealership to test-drive a new VW Passat. The car is new, smells new and drive good but I was not impressed by the ride at all. I expected too much from that car, a good car nonetheless. It lacked leg room, real luxuary, and my wife was not as excited about it after driving it. So we were about to leave the place when we walked through the Used car lot.
We stop by a couple of Used Audis (96 to 98). They looked great even though they were used. Both interiors and exteriors are in great condition; the quality is outstanding. These cars are made to last and they still look great. The Audi A6 caught our eyes more than the A4 because of the size in spite of the more sporty look of the A4 (Consider that versus the BMW Series 3). My wife thought it was a great car and asked for the keys. We sat in it and fell in love. Why? in a few words: Quality, luxuary, loaded with useful options, feeling of safety, comfort, prestige... We immediately took it for a spin. The vehicle kept up to our expectations. The silence added to the comfort made us feel very good about driving this car; we felt safe! The Automatic leather seats adjust in many posiitons to make any person feel comfy. I am 6'2&quot; and 230 lbs, my wfe is 5'8&quot; and both of us just felt great. The steering wheel can be adjusted from front to back, and up/down, a big plus! Anybody can find the prefect driving position. Leg room is excelent, better than the BMW series 5 in the front and back.
WE just had to ahve this car. At that point, I had shopped around for new Passats, used cars uncluding BMWs. Let me tell you, when we saw what we could get that Audi for, we just bought it! We saved a few thousands dollars versus the BMW, and got a BETTER car. no doubt about it. Here the key word is value!! But you still get a high quality luxuary car!
let me tell you more about our experience with this A6. 
drive it and let the Automatic Climate Control take charge of the temprature, just tell it what you want and it'll OBEY! Should you like to play with the buttons, just switch to manual! Other fetures are an automatic sunroof, a 6 speaker stereo, power windows &amp; seats &amp; doors remote entry), valet key, mirror defrost, windshield integrated antenna, phone ready, in dash computer, alloy wheels, and more. By the way, the driver's seat can keep 4 positions in memory, so you don't have to spend 10 minutes finding your pefect seating position after your spouse took the car for a ride, and believe me, she or he will! Both seats and mirrors adjust back to your posiiton when you open the door with your remote! My wife drove the cra home fomr the dealership. two days after, I was driving the Audi, and kept driving it everyday! I handed the keys of my 98 Expedition to my wife and we switched. That is ho much I like the Audi. I gave up my long-dsired Expedition which I could not live without a few days before! but let's go back to the Audi A6..
This car is equipped with 2.8l V6 combined with a great and very responsive automatic transmission that adjust to your type of driving. The engine is very smooth and quiet. He will give you a lot of pleasure driving hundreds of miles toward you favorite vacation spot. The car could use a little more power and torque but nothing bad. It is after all a luxuary sedan made for driving long distances safely and comfortably with up to 4 passangers. It'll still take you up to 130 miles per hour in spite of the speed regulator! remember Speed is limited and kills everyday! My car can got 130 mph, that does not mean I drive at that speed!
I can't really think of anything negative to say. Audi is one of the best car makers in the world and sell cars that can beat BMWs, MErcedez, or Lexus for a few thousand dollars less. A piece of advice: Audis are usually very well taken care of, and stay &quot;IN&quot; after the years thanks to their traditional yet attractive design, so look for a USED one. They have low miles, are well built, and look great after the years.
Finally, if you can afford the extra investment, go for the Quattro version. They stick to the road!!! During the winter, you will outrun SUVS! and save on gas!

 Shop around and compare with the BMWS which are overrated AND OVERPRICED! You might just become a AUDI lover.<br><br>
