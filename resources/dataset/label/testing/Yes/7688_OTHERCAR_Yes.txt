            WELL, here's a winner, finally. I'll unabashedly admit it, the Volvo S60 T5 is the first Swede in a long time to move me. That it did so within the first drive, and by the bucketloads, is really something else, if you know the score with Volvos and me. 

Not that the previous ones were bad people movers. Far from it, but they just never cut my cloth. I'd call it a case of emotional detachment - a lack of visceral communication, if you will. The S40 Phase II was simply too cool to get warm to, while the S80 (both 2.9 and T6), despite having a bolder personality, still hinted at enough detachment from a driver's point of view to preclude it in my Christmas wish list (I wish I had enough money, in any case). 

Not so the S60. No, this one is different, and in so many ways. The suggestions brought about by the advent of the multi-role V70XC Cross Country are to be seen here, transcribed into the more precise sedan form in more solid progression. The result is a car that wants, no, deserves, to be driven. 

The S60 displays very good tactility at both low and mid-driving speeds, and is, in my opinion, the best Volvo yet in terms of overall communication. Although not the sharpest I've driven, there's no hint of vagueness from the chassis, and the B5234T3 2.3-litre powerplant mates beautifully with it, and it is this synergistic precision that ensures a drivability missing previously. Oh, and that power. It corrupts, really. 

It isn't perfect, of course. I'd have liked a firmer, more progressive steering feel at higher speeds, and the suspension, while informative and supple at cruising levels, could be tauter in the twists and turns the everyday S60 driver, being of a different nature altogether, is bound to subject it to. 

But that's nitpicking, really. The S60 T5, as it is, is more than pretty accomplished - it's the most complete Volvo yet. It's not everyday that something comes along that would make those propeller or tristar-bearing Germans nervous. The S60 T5 is that car.
