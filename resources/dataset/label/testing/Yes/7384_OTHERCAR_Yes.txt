            For quite a while I'd been wishing that the WRX would be shipped stateside, as I'd read review upon review of this car in British and Australian car magazines, all giving it praise.

I put one on order the day Subaru officially announced that the car was being shipped to the US, and picked mine up on March 15th from the first shipment.

The seats are the most comfortable I've sat in, with bolstered sides that won't let you slip around during quick cornering even if you wanted to wear nylon pants!  The Momo leather-wrapped steering wheel says "grab me, turn me, squeeze me".  The shifter is just slick enough to not be too notchy, with the aluminum racing pedals feathered against your feet as you let the clutch go and mash on the gas to get to 60 in about five and a half seconds.

The brakes refuse to fade, even when driving through the Cascade mountain passes, though I wish the US had gotten the larger 4-piston caliper brakes that Europe, Japan, and Australia got, along with the 17" wheels (16" are standard on the US WRX).

The handling is outstanding.  Thanks to the 50/50 torque split from front to rear, you feel as if you are being carried in the car, instead of being pushed (with a rear-wheel drive car) or pulled (with a front-wheel drive car).  The fact that it's full-time is confidence-inspiring; there is no waiting for some computer inside the car to "convert you to 4WD" like on some vehicles; the power is at the wheels that need it, _when_ you need it, taking that 25mph highway interchange at 40, in the rain.  There is body roll present, but even if you take that 25mph interchange at 60, your Big Gulp in your cupholder ought to stay full without spilling.  At the limit, there is slight understeer for predictability, but if you'd rather the car oversteer, a 10-minute job with a $50 20mm or 22mm rear sway bar will fix that for you, _and_ flatten out nearly all that's left of your body roll.

The in-dash 6-CD stereo is convenient and ample for most people, but if you aren't satisfied with the sound, the optional upgraded sound package won't impress you either; there are a number of places online ( check the vendor forum at www.i-club.com for a start) that make Impreza-specific sound systems that sound great at great price.  Since the stock head unit is a double-din height unit, you now have several options as to what to fill the space with, since most aftermarket head units are single-din height.

The only downside from owning this car is that for the first few weeks you own one, your cheeks hurt... from smiling too much.  It's not that you smile any less afterward (ie when the break-in period of 1000 miles is over), but that your cheeks eventually get strong enough that you don't notice them getting tired any more.

If driving is just a way to get from point A to point B for you, and you're more concerned about your backseat passengers (or backseat drivers) than driving pleasure, you might want to look at something produced by the Germans.  However, if your goal is to get a car that caters to the driver, is a blast to drive, and you can afford it, you need to buy this car.  

You can expect to pay about $22,600 before tax or options (but including destination charge) for the wagon model, which is about $500 over invoice.  Expect to pay about $500 more for the sedan.

So, what are you waiting for?
