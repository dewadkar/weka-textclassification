            We bought the Dodge Grand Caravan LE after test driving many other brands of minivans.  We owned a smaller, two door car and my husband had to be dragged kicking and screaming to even look at a minivan.  But the truth was, our family was growing, and the car was not.  At over 6 feet tall, my husband had a terrible time fitting in the car with a car seat and child in the back seat.  We both test drove the Caravan and he fell in love with it immediately.  
It drives smoothly, is easy to handle and there's no problem seeing over the hood to pull into a parking space.  We drive south each year to visit family and what a treat to pack up the van and still have room to sit!  I can move easily from the front seat to the far back seat, if needed, to entertain a child while traveling.  And, as the kids grow, it's easy to separate them into their own areas when the bickering begins.  Both the center and rear seats are removable for a larger cargo area, but they are very heavy and I cannot remove them alone.  Originally, I had not been willing to spend extra for the &quot;Grand&quot; version - having an extra foot of space in the far rear cargo area.  BUT - once seeing the difference in person, it's well worth it.  We have to carry a stroller back there and there's still room for plenty of shopping bags!
The front driver's panel is easy to read and it's even easy for me to reach the stereo and heat/ac controls without having to stretch too far.  I totally enjoy driving the Grand Caravan whether it be across town, or halfway across the country.  A great vehicle for any family!<br><br>
