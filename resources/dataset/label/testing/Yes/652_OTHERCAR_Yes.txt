            I had been following the digital camera market for several years, waiting for a camera that could produce quality 8X10 prints that was under $1000.  The Nikon CoolPix 950 was the perfect answer.The 3X optical zoom is excellent, and it is really easy to use.  The automatic mode is essentially point-and-shoot - my wife was taking great pictures as soon as she picked it up.  The manual mode has more options that I need, but I'm slowly learning to use them.  Accessory #1 -- you must get an additional memory card.  I got a 64MB card, and I have never run out of &quot;film&quot;.  It fits 119 pictures at 1600x1200 in normal compression mode.  The additional freedom you have when you aren't worrying about how many pictures you have left is great.  Accessory #2 -- The Sandisk USB CompactFlash card reader.  It only takes a minute or two to download an entire 64MB of pictures.  Accessory #3 + #4 The zoom and telephoto adaptors.  The picture quality is excellent, but they both obscure the viewfinder, and you are forced to frame your shot with the LCD.  This takes a bit of getting used to, but does yield good pictures.  I have only two complaints:  1) The lenscap was very difficult to attach to the strap, and the attaching loop broke after a few months.  2) The printed manual is incomplete.  For example, it has an entry in the index for instructions on how to change the image resolution, but the instructions don't actually appear anywhere in the manual.<br><br>
