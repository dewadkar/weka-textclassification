                Chevy makes the best trucks!! Period!! I own a 92 half ton work truck and I love it. This is a very nice truck, and I constantly get compliments on it. My truck has been made to stand out in a crowd, with a 2 inch lift, 32 inch tires, 15x8 inch rims, fender flares, bug shield, cap top, a bumpin sound system, off road lights and a pre-runner style brush guard. Check it out at www.geocities.com/kdx728 (just copy this link and paste it in your browsers address bar).
  
    I have had a few things go wrong, the starter and alternator died within 1500 miles of each other (both were bearing failures), but the truck is used HEAVILY off road, and has 130,000 miles. The silver paint job has just begun to peel slightly. Where ever there is a chip or scratch that goes through the paint it has peeled back, so now I have a few quarter sized spots on my ride. But silver is one of the cheapest paints, and I'm redoing in this summer. The problem never occured till I came to college in Houghton, which is up on Lake Superior. I think the extreme winter helped in messing up the paint. I guess this is a regular problem with 94 and older Chevys.
    
    This truck has done it all, towing, hauling, snow runs, mud bogs and tree removing. I love the way these trucks look. They ride good, they handle good, and they look really good. I have the baseline 4.3 liter V-6, which is WAY down on power with the 32 inch tires and 3.32 rear end. I would really like to get some new gears and a 350, but for now I am a poor college student.

    These trucks are great workers. They tow, haul and take abuse all day long. There are sooo many Chevys used in the construction yards and stuff in my town. Mine has been overloaded, overworked, overdriven and overjumped far to many times, with no problems. One bad thing is that with the IFS suspension lift kits are VERY expensive. Most people I know just get body lifts for them. It's like $1200 for a 4" lift. And you can't reliably lift the IFS over 6". Older Chevys and other straight axle trucks can be lifted 6" or more for as little as $300. I am planning on dong a straight axle swap, someday.....

Update
Now have 145,000 miles on this thing, still runs and drives perfect. 

Striped it down this summer and repainted the whole truck to get rid of the peeling problem. That was a LOT of sanding. Figures, the week after we finished my friend finds his orbital sander so we could do his truck.

The seat has started to wear through on the drivers side, but it has a lot of time on it, so it's not really a flaw.

Other than that it has continues to hold up perfectly, taking all the abuse I dish out.
