            If you are looking at getting a sedan you can't go wrong with one of these pups.  They are wonderfully overpowered, the engine can be sedate and cool but step on it and it comes to life.  The 5 speed completely transforms this car into a no nonsense sports machine.  The auto is no slouch either. The five speed could be better but is by no means bad.  A short throw would fix it but it doesn't bother me. Its better than my 93 Accord 5 speed and way better than anything Gm craps out.
 The engine is assembled 80% by machine -which means less chance of human error and more reliability for you.  It spools up easily and smoothly and gives you a genuine rush of acceleration whenever it is needed. The newer 3.5 V6's are the same thing just a little bigger to deal with the extra lbs they have added to the car recently. It has a timing chain that is on for the life of the engine.  I have200K+ miles -regular oil changes that's it. This is a reliable car. Gas mileage is 22 city unless you push it, to 29 on the highway at 75mph.

My recommendations:  Spend $1000 on some conservative looking 17" wheels and rubber. Don't trick it out or anything. Get some Borbet's or something. Not only does it set you max apart from others and personalize it to make it special it dramatically improves the handling characteristics -cornering, breaking, etc. As it is now this thing will just melt the rubber of the stock all season tires.  A bigger footprint and a stickier tire go a long way and don't effect the ride quality as much as they improve it really.

Secondly if you get a maxima - get a front tower strut brace (a $60 aluminum bar that connects the two strut towers under the hood in front. Check ebay.)- They are so easy to put on my grandmother could do it no joke.  Takes about 5 to 10 minutes and the handling improvements are wonderful.  Tightens up the steering, makes the cars structure more rigid and allows the suspension do what it is suposed to do -absorb the rough and provide the driver with excellent feedback. At speed on the interstate the car takes a line and stays put -no more big sedan sloppyness, bounding around or anything -the car will become much more stable. Slow corners will become easier with better turn in -manuverability.  Even my wife noticed. Best part is -it does NOT effect the ride quality at all. In fact it improves it since the suspension does what its supposed to. All gain and no pain.  Nissan uses em on some of the inifiniti line but to save money- did not include the Max.

Wheels are optional but get the strut brace. then Enjoy the ride.
