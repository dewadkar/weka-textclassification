            Here is my little story on how I came about our 2000 QX4: I had a 95 Pathfinder SE 5-speed with all the options (AC, CC, heated leather, PW, PDL, etc) and it was getting up in miles. We were looking into getting a new or slightly used Xterra. When I went to the lot, they had none that I really except the expensive Supercharged unit and I am not too sure about buying an SUV with forced air induction. Something in the back of my mind tells me the reliability is somewhat suspect. So I said I wanted to look at newer Pathfinders and the salesman told me if I wanted a newer Pathfinder, he could give me a deal on a used QX4. He said it was basically a Pathinder with more options. It definitely has more options!

I tested it out and bought it. It had 30,000 and I paid just over $20,000. I think they all come standard with leather and the usual AC, CC, PW, PDL, keyless, P-mirrors, P-seats, climate control, compass/thermometer. Mine does not have heated seats, but it came with a moonroof, CD changer under the passenger seat, as well as a Bose tape/CD player in-dash. I honestly didn't research the QX4 as much as the Xterra because I wasn't looking to buy one, I just happened into it.

I really liked how many luxury features the truck has. The leather is very comfortable and I love having the compass and the outside temp. For me, the climate control seems easy to use and it's nicer than the old levers in my Pathfinder. I also like the power moonroof. My Pathfinder had the old flip up kind. In other words, this is a major upgrade in luxury from most SUVs.

Compared to the Pathfinder I had, the storage and power outlets are much more accessible and convenient. It has three cupholders in the console, a nice lit ashtray we use for change and the armrest has a double opening that works well for a few CDs on top and junk like cell phone cords underneath. There are also power outlets on the back of the console for rear passengers and in the back cargo area for things like raft inflators.

I am also pretty impressed by how it drives and handles. It is a little softer than the Pathfinder, but it holds the road well and brakes fairly good. One thing I miss is the all-wheel disc brakes my Pathfinder had. You would think on the upgraded QX4 discs all the way around would be standard. I also had carbon-fiber pads on the Pathfinder and it stopped on a dime. 

It is a bit underpowered, especially considering many SUVs come standard with over 200 horsepower. But, the QX4 does a good job with its V6. Besides, this is kind of a touring SUV and I don't think Infiniti had in mind heavy off-road use or carving corners in the canyons with it. I don't think many QX4 owners plan on doing much towing either, and I would say if you plan to do so, buy a Durango or something with a V8. I have been getting around 15-16 MPG and that is probably about what every other SUV gets. That's the price you pay for the bigger rig. I also have a Maxima that we take on trips because it gets about 25 mpg.

I really like the 4WD system. I took it on a hilly back road and it really grips well in the "auto" mode. The truck doesn't feel as rugged as my old Pathfinder, but it seems to handle it's own. It is convenient to have an electronic switch, instead of having to shift into 4WD. I hope it doesn't ever fail, but I have owned several Nissans, and have had very few problems with them.

I have only had the QX4 a little while, but it basically runs and drives like brand new. Nothing has gone wrong except the bulb in the dome light went out and I haven't replaced it yet.
