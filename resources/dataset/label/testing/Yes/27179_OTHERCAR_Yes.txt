            My wife and I purchased the 1998 VW Passat for all of its safety features and the extra head and leg room it provides over and above the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.  Although it is obviously priced higher than these Japanese competitors, we felt the longer body gave it a luxury feeling those cars could not provide.  We did not opt for the sunroof or leather package, but we did upgrade to a V6 with a 5-spd engine.  The combination of these latter two features gives you the feeling of a sports car when you are looking to pass that pesky driver on the interstate who won't get out of the left lane.  Two factors to consider that I felt were going to be benefits but have not turned out that way.  The 5-spd is a pain sometimes to put in reverse quickly.  Although the safety feature that requires you to press down on the stick is meant to prevent you from putting the car in reverse by error, it does such a good job that it can take several tries to find the gear.  The other factor which gives this review its name is the 6-disc CD changer.  As portrayed in the commercial, the 8-speaker stereo system is great, but because the CD changer that VW offers goes into the trunk, you rarely end up changing any of your CD's.  Most people keep their CD's inside the car and change them on the fly, but with this option, you have to wait until you stop.  We encountered this problem on a road trip recently.  Anyway, overall this car is impeccable but you will have these two quirks to put up with on the 5-spd with the CD changer.<br><br>
