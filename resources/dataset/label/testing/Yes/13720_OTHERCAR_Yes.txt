            I had a company vehicle before I purchased my BMW 328ia. It was a Ford Taurus, with a perfect sticker price...free! Having a company car had a lot of pros, and very few cons. My company paid for everything from fuel to insurance to maintenance. Life was grand.

But then I listened to a head hunter, and decided to take a position with another company. I was out of a vehicle for the first time in about six years. My wife has owned either an Audi or a Jeep Grand Cherokee for ten years, so I wanted to get something different.

I must admit, I did not investigate the purchase of this vehicle as much as I should have. I found the vehicle (2500 miles from my home) on the internet, and then negotiated by telephone / Email. I had to fly across the country where I was to relocate. I did not want to be burdened with not only finding a home, but also with a vehicle. I know German engineering fairly well, but had never owned a BMW until now.

Let me say that my wife will probably never own another car! She loves it. It handles awesome (even in the snow of Utah), looks great, has all of the gettyup' she could ask for, the gas mileage is better than any car we have owned, and it is very, very comfortable. I do not think that we could have asked for a better choice. In my case it was dumb luck. I did not even know anyone who owned a BMW. But I must say that we have been very happy with ours. The only change will be that next time I will probably buy the 5 series to get a little more room inside. But other than that, I think we are hooked.<br><br>
