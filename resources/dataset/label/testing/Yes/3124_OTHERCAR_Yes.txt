            The Hyundai Elantra is a great value.  It looks great, drives smoothly and it has good gas mileage.  It makes some of the more expensive cars in its category look pale by comparison (i.e Chrysler Neon).  Hyundai offers a good warranty, roadside assistance and many features that would be optional on other cars.  I look forward to purchasing many more cars from Hyundai in the future.  For a reliable automobile, that looks good and performs well on the road, check out the Hyundai Elantra.

Who should buy this vehicle:  Students, Small families, Great as a business vehicle.

What is it like to drive this vehicle:  Quiet, smooth, fast.  You can barely hear the engine purring beneath the hood, even when you're standing  right next to the car.  Also, it handles great on the road (in the city and on the highways)
