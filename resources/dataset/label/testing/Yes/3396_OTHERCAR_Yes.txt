            We bought the Quest in August of 1997 because I was pregnant and wanted something more roomier then my jeep.
We found the quest and have been happy ever since.

The gas mileage is great I can get 22 miles to the gallon.  

There is lots of room and I can seperate the kids if they are fighting with each other, that is another plus, haha.

We had a 3yr/36,000 mile warranty when we purchased the quest and at 45,000 miles the heads started leaking so we thought we were going to have to spend alot of money to fix the Quest but Nissan fixed our Quest for free.  Now this is a company that stands behind their product!!! 

The seats are comfortable, the handling is great and acceleration is wonderful.  The only problem I have is with the radio buttons in the back my son to this day still likes to change the radio station on me.    

I also wanted to mention how quiet the motor is, sometimes I can't tell if the car is running.
