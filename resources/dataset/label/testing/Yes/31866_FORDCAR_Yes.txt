            I didn't think I would have to get a new car so soon and I love my Escort.  But we are expecting again and have no choice.

I purchased my 4-door escort used in August of 1998 when I was expecting my second child.  I had started out looking for cars such as a Camry or Accord.  I knew I wanted reliability to which I had not had with GM previously.

I saw a hunter green version of the Escort and did not even believe that it was an Escort.  It was very sleek and sporty looking.  I ended up finding an Escort with 8,000 miles on it and only been driven a year.  The price was right and I never looked back.

The car has been a dream.  I have not had one problem with the car running.  It handles very well in snow, and heavy rain.  The gas mileage is very much appreciated during all of the gas hikes.  The air conditioner is ice cold and the heater will run you out if you let it.  The trunk will hold alot.  I always keep my tandem stroller back there and I can also fit a weeks worth of groceries along with it. 

The few problems I have with this car is the amount of foot space in the back seat when you are sitting back there.  It's fine for a child but an adult will be cramped unless you have the front seat all the way forward.  The cab noise while on the highway is very loud compared to other vehicles I have owned.  Although this was something that Consumer Reports had mentioned when I researched I didn't not think it would be this bad.  One other small falw is that you can't fit more then a medium size drink from a fast food joint in the drink holder if you have the car in park.  And don't try to force it (You will wear the soda!)  Also don't call the dealership asking them to turn off the passenger side air bag.  They will tell you it's impossible.  I called 2 different Ford dealers.  I finally talked to Ford and they told me it was possible to have a switch installed.  (You have to be approved by N.H.T.S.A)  Even if approved good luck finding a dealer to do the work.

I am going to be sad to see my Escort go.  I am expecting our fourth child and will need more space.  Due to the air bag problem I am not even going to keep this as a side car because we can't all fit.  

However, if it wasn't for the fact that we are growing as a family I would love to have my escort.  This is the only car I have ever owned that did not have to have a mechanic service it by 50,000 miles.  (outside of oil changes)

When I get older and no longer need a mini-van I will seriously consider another Ford.  This one has been a great investment!
