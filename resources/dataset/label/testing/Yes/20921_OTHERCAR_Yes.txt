              This past week me and a couple of friends went to a dealership and took this baby around the block. We each took turns driving this machine around the neighborhood.  I also saw this automobile at a past carshow and read about them. The base prices range between $16,000-$20,000. It looks like an old school car with the curves and raw power look. One of my buddies thought it was the same car from the movie &quot;total recall&quot; with arnold when he boarded that taxi cab. For people who want to look good and stand out in the crowd this suits as a family or a singles car. Inside the cruiser provides good storage with folding seats to maximize your space. Of course, it has the up to date safety features, airbags, custom design model to provide maximum safety(you have to read the safety reports). You can take road trips, camping trips and make use of its capabilities, or chaparone the team around(kids baseball, etc. buddies).
  It has a 2.4 liter DOHC four cylinder engine, 150 horsepower ). It's drive train is 5-speed standard transmission. Now for the internal parts, comfortable seating that you can take naps in, color-coordinated panel, , dual air bags , a sun roof optional. Good suspension, good wheel base ratio in comparison with other sized cars. However, for you speed demons you have to bypass this one. It has a slow pick up/acceleration still for this cruiser it's size and girth you can't expect it to burn rubber. Overall, it's a good handling, feel, comfort and stlye automobile which will apeal to new car buyers and others.
