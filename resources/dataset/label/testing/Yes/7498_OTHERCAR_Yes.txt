            I bought this car about a year and a half ago, and so far I must say I am very satisfied with the Stratus.
The short of my review: A great looking, mostly reliable car that drives very well for a family sedan.

The long of my review is as follows:

DRIVE: I own the Base Stratus (1997) with the 2.4L 4 cylinder engine. It generates 150 horsepower with 167 ft-lbs of torque. It has a smooth shifting 4 spd automatic transmission. (I would have preferred the manual transmission, but unfortunately, Chrysler engineers decided to make the manual available with the Neon's 2.0L 132hp 4 cyl. I went with the bigger engine.) It accelerates quickly off the line, and speeds up strongly until it shifts into second. When pressed hard, the engine seems to lose punch around 5500rpm. For passing on highways, it does fairly well. It will accelerate form 65-80mph surprisingly quickly. Also, the car does not seem to struggle at high speeds. It feels quite composed even at 90 miles per hour. The car also handles twisty roads very well. It has little body roll, and is a real pleasure to drive through mountain roads. It has enough power to go uphill quickly, and has the handling ability to remain in control when doing so. The drawbacks to the drive: the engine is quite loud and sounds unrefined. When pressed to the limit, the engine will be heard even if the radio is playing loud. Additionally, road noise is prominent in this car, especially at higher speeds. The other significant drawback is the braking ability. The base stratus has front disc and rear drums, and weighs approximately 3000 lbs. A heavy car with drums does not match well. According to Car and Driver, it takes over 200 feet to come to a complete stop from 70 miles per hour. I've unfortunately had first hand experience with this car's poor brakes. I was driving on the freeway when traffic suddenly slowed drastically. I slammed on the brakes, but the car did not decelerate very well. I had to pull into the shoulder to avoid rear-ending someone. Overall, however, I am quite pleased with this car's driving dynamics.

INTERIOR: The controls are very logically placed and easy to reach. The instruments are easy to read as well. (I do not like the white-faced instruments of the 1999+ Stratus. 1998-1995 have white numbers on a black background, my personal preference.) The very deep dash is slightly remeniscant to that of a minivan. In the center of the dash (above the radio and climate controls), it is around 2 feet deep. During sunny driving, there is a significant amount of glare visible, however the design makes the car appear more roomy inside. Although I don't think the border around the climate control and radio is very aesthetically pleasing, the controls are easy to reach and use. There is a storage bin underneath the radio: great for a discman. (My car does not have the optional CD player.) There are 4 cupholders, however I think the front ones are poorly placed since taller drinks are locked in place when the transmission is placed in "park". The base stereo system has very good bass and treble response, however the sound quality could be better.

RELIABILITY: Overall, very good. However, it has had one very expensive problem. At 37,500 miles (the warranty expired at 36,000) the headgasket failed, costing $800 to repair. Other than that, the car has had no problems. I bought the car with 22,000 and I how have nearly 63,000.

MISC: Personally, I think the car is very good looking. It has an athletic stance, and I like the front and back of the car. It's not a compact, however it does not look like your stereotypical American boxy car. I think Dodge did a very good job designing the car. Having folding rear seats is a must-have feature for me now that I've gotten used to having it, however a 60/40 split would be even better. The trunk is large, and with the seats down, you can carry most anything. I do, however, have 2 complaints about the overall design of the car. 1st: the engine is so crammed that the battery is placed behind the left wheel well. This means the wheels must be turned completely to the left to remove the battery. 2nd: The headlights are somewhat weak. Even the highbeams fail to do a very good job of illuminating a very dark road.


Overall, I think the value of this car is unbeatable. As a side note, I would not recommend a 1996 or older stratus, as their reliability tends to be poor, and they lack a center arm rest. Headlights are even worse then the newer ones, and the rear-window seal tends to be defective in the pre 1997 models. The 1997 and newer models tend to be quiter, and slightly more refined. They also have better standard radios, and seem to be put together better. In closing, if you opt for a 1997 or newer Stratus, I don't think you'll be able to find a better car for a better price.
