            I just bought my first Grand Am SE at the beginning of August. After owning two Mazda Proteges, I was ready for a change.  Unfortunately, due to an auto accident, I had to buy a new car.  While I was laid up, without transportation, I did plenty of research on what kind of vehicle I wanted.  Then, my dad and I took a day and went out and looked at cars, but didn't drive any at that time.  At the end of that day, we had ruled out several of the cars that I was interested in.  My first choice was the Grand Am, but I wasn't buying anything until I could drive it.  About a month later, my dad and I went out looking again.  This time I was able to test drive.  I drove several different cars, and our last stop was the Pontiac dealer.  We drove the Grand Am, and I was very impressed with the power, and handling.  Needless to say, the dealer gave me a price that I couldn't refuse.  The next day, I went to my bank, picked up a check, and drove the Grand Am home.  

My 12 year old daughter likes it, because it is sporty looking, but it will fit her and all of her friends, too.  I think it looks like a sports car, but has the room of a family car.  So far, it's been very reliable.  I have about 3000 miles on it already.

The only complaint that I have, is that my Protege did get better gas mileage. I seem to be averaging about 25 miles per gallon, so far.  I wish that it got as much as my Protege, but since the engine is bigger, and has more power, I'm able to live with it.

The engine is a V-6, and is the most powerful car I have driven.  I seems to go fast without even feeling like it is.  Which could be bad, except for having cruise control.  I'm one of those people who like to drive fast with the windows down, and the radio cranked up.  <br><br>
