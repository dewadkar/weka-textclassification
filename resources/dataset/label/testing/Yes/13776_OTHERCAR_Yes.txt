            I own a 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab pickup. I got it as a graduation gift from my daddy. My truck is bright blue, and I've gotten pulled over quite a few times because of this(that and the 360 V8). It attracts the eyes of many police officers. But other than that and the horrible gas mileage, I LOVE this truck. It is very roomy and comfortable. The interior is very well laid out, the gauges are very clear. The available amenities suit the average person well. It has a convenient trip computer, and estimated distance to empty. Dodge trucks typically sit higher than Fords or Chevys, that provides a better height advantage. I haven't had any problems with this truck at all. It has great acceleration when necessary. I definitely recommend this truck to anyone in the market.<br><br>
