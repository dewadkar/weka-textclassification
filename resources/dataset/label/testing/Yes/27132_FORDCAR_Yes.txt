            I originally bought my 93 Bronco almost a year ago, and I still love it! 


When I was looking for a new vehicle last year I was looking for a truck that can skirt around the California Commercial Vehicle tax, be large enough to haul our racecar and boat, yet be somewhat smaller and maneuverable. After looking and researching I settled on one vehicle, the Ford Bronco. 

From my experience over the past year and 30,000 miles I have found the Bronco to be quite more versatile than most other SUVs out there. Although larger than most cars, it handles very much like a car. The turning radius allows me to make U-turns within 2 lanes. (Very good for city driving) Although it is a high profile vehicle, high speed maneuvering is taken with ease. You wont be bucked by this Bronco.  

The interior is roomy and functional, as are the controls, but the cup holders are too small for anything other than your average 12-ounce cup or soda can. One other rant I have is the original radio was way underpowered, and the stocker speakers aren�t as good as they could be. As for cargo, the rear seat folds down easily with the pull of 2 latches or can come out completely to make the cargo area as big as a short bed pickup. The passenger space is ample, the passenger seat and back seat are an excellent fit for all but the tallest of riders. (The rear seat is elevated about 2 inches) In addition, I have never had someone ask, �Can you move the seat up a bit?�

The 4-wheel drive is wonderful; it helped my Bronco handle beautifully on snowy roads. I have gotten stuck only a couple times, but only due to my own idiocy and the fact I have highway tires on the Bronco. The pulling power the 5.8 (351 ci) motor creates is great. Weather your dragging a smashed and rolled racecar off of the track, or pulling the family boat you�ll never have to sweat it. 

Self-maintaince is a bit of a hassle since oil changes are a bit messy (the drain plug is right over the front axle) and if you value your hands do not do a tune up while the engine is hot. So far the only money I have had to put into my Bronco (Which had 87,000 miles on it when I bought it) has been all-voluntary. I have yet to have a component go bad on me well, I take that back I have had a shock snap off the front while I was playing. Since the Bronco comes standard with dual shocks on the front its kind of a non-issue. Modifications I can recommend are larger, less restrictive exhaust, (I put a 3 inch cat-back with a Flomasteron mine) and a K&amp;N air filter. 

Don�t take me wrong there are some bad spots about this truck, the biggest one is the transmission, the one I have is �tired� and shifts poorly from 2nd to third. In addtion the E4OD Transmission has had a bad history, but '93 seems to be the best year for them. The second biggest is the power band of this truck, although it is very tourquy in low RPMs (good takeoff) and at high RPMs powerful, in the midrange where the gears like to rest during highway travel is somewhat gutless. Merging into traffic that is going faster takes a bit of timing. The next modification I plan to make, a Powerchip I�m real sure will fix that.

I have driven the explorer, expedition, (please don�t buy this vehicle, if you drive one you�ll understand) Durango, and Tahoe. And by far the Bronco is more maneuverable, powerful, road and off-road worthy.
