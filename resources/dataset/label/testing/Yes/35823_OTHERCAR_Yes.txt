            This has been by far one of the best vehicle purchases we've ever made.  Our 95 SL2 has just turned 80,000 miles and has only been in the shop once for a very minor oil leak, which was repaired under warranty.  

There are a couple minor problems that I have heard of regarding this vehicle, however.  These include minor oil consumption in vehicles over 70k miles and alternators going bad between 70k and 80k miles.  These are the only two common problems I am aware of, but neither has affected us.  One minor problem is the spark plug wires, which get replaced about every 10000 miles because they begin to give some radio interference, but this is a relatively inexpensive aftermarket fix (in fact, I only paid for it once, all the rest of the times they've been replaced on lifetime warranties).  This is a problem that has also affected our 97 SC2.  

The plastic body panels are incredible!  I have zero dings and this car has been in many situations that would have caused at least minor body damage on most cars, such as taking a direct blow to the body from a 6&quot; chunk of metal from the wheel of a tractor-trailer at 70mph.  The car does have kind of a plastic appearance along the dash area, but I continue to receive many comments even at 4 years old.  Another bonus with this car, from what has been discussed on the Saturn list, is that the clutch seems to last much longer than other cars... there are many people on the &quot;list&quot; with original clutches on their saturns well over 130000 miles.  Finally, this car is a weekend mechanics dream!  Everything is very easy to get to for just about every repair.  

As far as insurance, the insurance company informed me that Saturns bring in some of the lowest premiums, which was very pleasant news after owning a ford probe.  

Driving this car is great!  The steering is very precise and the power is definitely there.  The ride is overall very comfortable, but the motor on the 95's and below can seem somewhat loud from outside the car (but its not bad inside).  

People who should consider purchasing this vehicle are current college students and recent graduates who are looking for a reliable car for a relatively low cost.  

As a final note, we have like this car so much that we have also purchased a 97 SC2 and a 99 SL2.  If you would like some more information, check out the list at saturn@ucsd.edu.
