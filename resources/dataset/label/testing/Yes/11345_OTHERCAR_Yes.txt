            I never wanted a van. Thought they looked so &quot;mom&quot; like.

Well this is our second van and it is great!!! I really could not live without the extra room a van provides.
BUT, I do have some complaints.  We had a Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer prior to this van..and it was SO big and so roomy. In the very back, I could lay down my side by side stroller FLAT, put my single stroller on top of that..with still TONS of room in the back of the van..for a 24 pk of water from Price Club...plus extra clothes and diapers...bags etc. it was GREAT!!!!

This van has tremendously less room. I guess the van manufacturers decided we did not need as much room in our vans. Yes, they look sportier and I like that---but personally, I would prefer the room.

I like this van because it has the built-in child seats-and that is so convenient. The color is blue=and it is really gorgeous.  The rear of the van has enough room to place my side by side stroller STANDING up and my singleton stroller next to it/across it kind of standing up also.  There is not much room for much else.

Our last van had a V-6 I believe. So its tough to get used to this little 4 cylinder van but the gas mileage is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I cannot begin to tell you!!!!!! I only fill up every week and a half or so unless I am doing a lot of driving. I find that exceptional in a van.<br><br>
