            My 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee(which I now use for my biz)is fast approaching 123,000 miles, and it couldn't perform any better! It drives like a car, takes the hills &amp; dales like a truck, and never, no never breaks a sweat! Of all the vehicles I have owned &amp;/or driven over the last 25 years, I feel confident in saying it's the best, and next year I intend to buy number 3 in my Jeep series(my husband has a Laredo Ltd., also a good buy and reliable, but for comfort, I choose my Grand Cherokee Laredo Ltd edition). My 15 yr old daughter has actually begged me to let her have my 96 in 2000 when I buy a new one(believe it...it's true!)because she loves the look, feel, and the confidence you feel when driving it.It's the first car she has been learning to drive, and prefers it to my son's 98 Camaro!
I would confidently pit her against any other SUV, van, sedan, etc... any day.It's a car you can buy with complete confidence.
