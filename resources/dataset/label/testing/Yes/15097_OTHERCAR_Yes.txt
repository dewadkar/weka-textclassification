In the early winter of 1999, my mother decided it was time for a new car.  Her old car, a 1988 Ford Taurus, was spending more time in the shop than in our driveway, and still had problems the mechanics failed to diagnose.  She had never owned a brand-new car (the Taurus, purchased in 1991, was the newest vehicle she'd ever owned) and she needed a reliable car that wouldn't nickle and dime her to poverty.  And so we set out to find the perfect car for her.  

<b>Process Of Elimination</b>

We avoided the Ford dealership; Grandmom was unhappy enough with her Taurus to know she didn't want to purchase another Ford.  We also avoided the GM dealerships because of previous experience.

Our first stop, since Grandmom really wanted to buy American, was the Dodge dealership.  She test drove a Dodge Neon (too small, uncomfortable to get in and out of) and a Dodge Stratus (more comfortable to drive but still uncomfortable getting in and out).

Our second stop was the Honda dealership.  I've owned two Hondas and loved them both, so although she wanted a domestic car, she was willing to consider a Honda.  She loved the Accord, finding it comfortable, responsive, and attractive.  The price, however, was not attractive.  She tried a Civic, which answered the price objection, but found it too small and not as comfortable.

Next stop was the Nissan dealership.  No one in our family had ever owned a Nissan, but we knew the quality was good.  She test drove a Nissan Altima and loved it.  It was comfortable, response was excellent, and she liked the looks.  Then she test drove a Maxima at the salesman's suggestion, and while she liked it, she didn't like it much more than the Altima, which had a price more to her liking.

<b>The Winner:  Nissan Altima GLE</b>

Grandmom purchased a Dusk Blue Nissan Altima GLE with sun roof and leather seats.  Almost two years later, she is still thrilled with her purchase and enjoys driving her car.  It's attractive, the engine is powerful enough for rapid acceleration when needed, and it's very comfortable to drive.  Because most of her driving is around town, I take her car a few times a month on my 35-mile drive to work so that it gets some highway time.  Although I'm not a fan of passenger cars (I prefer SUVs and Vans), I enjoy driving it.  The purchase price, $20,800, was a bit more than Grandmom had planned to spend, but almost two years later she has no regrets.

<b>The Good</b>

<b>Comfort:</b>  The Altima is very comfortable for the driver and front-seat passenger, with adjustable seats and plenty of leg room.  Back seat passengers do not have a lot of leg room, however, unless the front seats are adjusted forward.  Since Grandmom is pretty short, this is fine when she's driving, and two adults can ride comfortably in the back.  With me driving, however, only children are comfortable in the back.

<b>Controls:</b>  Cruise control, radio, temperature control, turn signals, wiper control and side mirror controls are all very well-placed and convenient.  Controls for the sun-roof are easily accessible as well, although they are not perfect.  (See &quot;The Bad&quot; below)

<b>Performance and Handling:</b>  The Altima's engine is powerful enough for rapid acceleration when needed, which is necessary here in the land of highway construction and short on-ramps, yet is not a gas-hog.  Steering is crisp and responsive, with good control for tight turns.  It has a sporty feel, which makes it fun to drive on curvy, mountain roads.

<b>Safety:</b>  The Altima has dual front passenger airbags, shoulder-harness seat belts in the front and the two outward back seats, and a center strap belt in the rear center.  Anti-lock brakes are standard.


<b>The Bad</b>

Although it doesn't bother Grandmom, I find the windshield, and especially the rear-view mirror, too close to me when driving the Altima.  This might be a result of many years driving larger vehicles, and I do get more comfortable with it the more I drive the car.

The only complaint Grandmom has, and which I share, is the control for the sun roof.   To slide the sunroof, you press and hold a switch, in the DOWN/OPEN position to open it or the UP/CLOSE position to close it.  To tilt the sunroof up for ventilation, you press and hold the switch in the UP/CLOSE position; to tilt it back down you press and hold it in the DOWN/OPEN position.  Although the language is a bit unclear, that's not the problem.  The problem is that the control is continuous, so if you don't release it at the right time you go from slid open all the way to the tilted up position, or from the tilted up position to open all the way.  It makes it very hard to close the roof completely and results in air noise and potentially to leaks.

<b>Overall Recommendation</b>

Grandmom has no regrets and if she ever had to replace this car she's certain she'd buy another Altima.  I'm not a car person, but if I had to drive a car instead of an SUV or a van, I'd seriously consider the Nissan Altima.  The quality is excellent, there have been no service issues or repairs necessary, and the car runs as well today as it did the day Grandmom brought it home.  Visibility is good, comfort is good, performance and fuel consumption are excellent, and the price is reasonable.  Grandmom gives it two thumbs up; I'd give it one and nine-tenths thumbs up!
