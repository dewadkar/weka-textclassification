            The 1998 Grand Prix GT is a driver's car. I have had two minivans and a Suburban just before this, and when I drove it I loved it instantly. Mine has all the options except sunroof and Heads Up Display. I find it so comfortable to drive that I rarely use the cruise control. I have carried adults in the back, and they say it is comfortable there too.

I considered the GTP briefly, but since it uses premium fuel, I decided against it, and with the recent price increases I am glad I went that way. The 3800 engine has plenty of power, and I have always been a die hard V8 lover. It is firm and stable on the highway, even at speeds in excess of 95 MPH (don't tell)

I have had a few problems in 30,000 miles, all repaired under warranty as follows. The headlights collected water. The dealer replaced them and the new ones have been fine. The rear brake rotors growled, new ones OK. The computer that controlled the remote door locks/alarm had to be replaced. This is a strange one...in really cold weather, the wipers would park straight up on the glass. Once the car warmed, they would be OK. The dealer put a repair kit on it, but told me that they only do it if the owner asks for it. So it pays to ask.  This may sound like a lot of trouble on a new car, but I consider it fairly normal.

I have had compliments on the look of the car, and it just begs to be driven. I think it lacks two things 1. a seat heater for the front passenger...only the driver gets one 2. Brighter headlights...I am afraid if I put more powerful bulbs in, they will melt the housings, so I live with them. <br><br>
