            As my Mustang was falling apart 3 months ago (literally!), I had no idea what kind of car to get that would be a high performance car as well as have room enough for future baby seats.  Then I test-drove a Saturn SL &amp; I was hooked immediately.  This car truly has zing!  A powerful engine that not only gets me from point A to point B, but also gets me to that point B quickly &amp; smoothly.  I feel comfortable knowing that I've chosen a car with not only safety features for myself (i.e., drivers side airbag), but also safety features for my future children, such as child safety locks on the back doors.  Another feature I'm appreciative of, since we're still in the middle of winter, is my heater doesn't need half an hour to warm up, as was the case with the 2 cars I've had before this one.  5 minutes is all.
A downside for me is the fact that I have a basic AM/FM radio only.  I like to make my own music tapes to listen to while driving &amp; my car doesn't have neither that nor a CD player.
Overall, I'd say this would be a great car for just about anybody!  It's a &quot;family&quot; car as well as a &quot;cool&quot; car.  This would be the kind of car I would recommend as a &quot;first-time&quot; car for teenage drivers, simply because it is a safe car &amp; doesn't &quot;guzzle&quot; gas.  <br><br>
