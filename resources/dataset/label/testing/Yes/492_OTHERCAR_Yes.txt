            I picked up my used 2002 Kia Optima about two months ago.  

In determining what kind of car to buy I came up with this list:  comfort while driving the in the daily grind of rush hour in Chicago, a decent radio (I'm middle aged so I'm just beginning to think that the music is too loud), air conditioning and a sunroof.  I would have loved a convertible, but I have three kids in car seats and there's just no way I'd fit them in the back seat of a convertible.  This would be our secondary car or rather--my car.  We normally tote the kids around in a mini-van, but should the van be in the shop we needed something that could carry everyone in a pinch.  With that in mind, four doors seemed the most logical.

What I looked at:  though I looked at several makes and models of cars that fit the above bill the one that stood out initially was the 2003 Hyundai Sonata.  I like the new styling as opposed to the 2002 version.  I have a friend who has a 2002 Sonata and he said a lot of positive things about his car.  He also warned me to avoid the 4 cylinder and get the 6, as did every review I read up to that point.

But alas, the Sonata was not meant to be--a little more than what we could comfortable afford.

What I got:  Lucky, I think.  I found this 2002 Kia Optima LS with everything sitting on a used car lot with only 3700 miles.  The warranty on Kias isn't as good as the Hyundai so there was only two years left, but even so, the price was set to move.  It appears the car was repossessed, hence the low mileage (Thanks CarFAX!).  It was in great shape--no damage.  Fully loaded with leather seats, ABS, sunroof, heated mirrors and seats, power seats, power antenna, CD player with a cassette.  Oh, yeah, this had everything I wanted.  I got a good price too.

So far:  I noticed right after the purchase that the car made a knocking noise when turning to the left.  Took it back and found that some bolt was loose on the right strut.  They tightened it to specs and all has been well ever since.  The car is pretty quiet and drives very smoothly both on city roads and highways.  The seats are very comfortable and include tilting headrests.  I&#146ve had an issue with the power window lock feature.  Its no problem to engage, but if I want to disengage I have to push the button firmly.  The only other quirking thing is the auto headlight feature.  In other cars it has to be dim for certain amount of time before the lights go on.  Not on this baby.  When traveling at 60 mph, if I go under a bridge, the shadow causes the lights to go on, and then about half a second after I clear the bridge, they go off.  I wonder if anything thinks I&#146m flashing them?  And I&#146m not sure how dark it has to be to get the lights to go on.  When its dusk I would expect the lights to come on, but they don&#146t.  No bother, I can flip them on manually.

The stereo is nice&#151sounds good for all kinds of music.  If I turn up the volume the speaker cover on the passenger door will vibrate with the bass, but I have to have it pretty loud.

I&#146m just over six feet and the cabin is very comfortable.  I like the layout of the dash (easy to see), the little storage place are just right for a commuter experience.  The cup holder in the center console is okay, but won&#146t hold a Big Gulp.  The large storage place in the middle is just tall enough to hold CD cases on their sides (I would have made this a little deeper so I could hold CDs with their spines facing up so I know what CD I&#146m looking for).  The seat is VERY comfortable.  And then there is the shiftronic transmission.  Can&#146t say that I use it a whole lot.  I do use it because its there, but I never really feel the urge to downshift to pass anyone (I&#146m so middle-aged).  The engine is fine.  I know that some people say that even the six needs more power and that may be but I find that if I mash the peddle I can get the car going pretty quick.  The tachometer red lines up near 7k and I&#146ve gotten the needle up to 6k when trying to hustle.  I haven&#146t tried the 0-60 test but I think this car would perform well for normal street maneuvering.  

The best parts are the brakes and suspension.  They are really well done.  There is little nose dive and the car decelerates smoothly whether you are stopping in a hurry or not.  There is also little body sway when I corner, regardless of speed. 

As for the gas mileage:  I had hoped for something better.  It guzzles gas like my old Intrepid did but with a smaller tank.  My in-city range is about 300 miles per tank so I get about 19.5-20.5 mpg and I guess about 23-25mpg on the freeway.

Finally, the styling:  Whereas Hyndaui took a step forward in styling between their 2002 and 2003 models, I think Kia went backwards.  I prefer the styling of the 2002 over the 2003.  Why compare to Hyundai?  Kia is owned by them and if you sit inside a Sonata and then sit in an Optima you realize they are really the same car inside.
