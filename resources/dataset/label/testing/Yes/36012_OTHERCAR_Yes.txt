            I just Recently got my Lincoln Mark VIII, and I had looked at many used cars to choose from, and chose the Mark VIII because of the features for the money.  For Less than 15 Grand I Got a Rear Wheel drive, V8, 290 hp, Luxury coupe, 4 wheel disk brakes, HID Head Lights, Leather, Trip Computer W Message center, moon roof, 10 disk cd, JBL Stereo. The only trick with buying a Mark is to look for a good one, and you will be rewarded.  I looked at over 15 of them, and there will be THE ONE that you are looking for.  Reliability has been good for the little while i have had it.  
The Motor is AWSOME.  With fairly good low end, but once you get to about 3000 rpm, you are off to the races, all the way to 6000.  And the Highway mileage is very good for a 3700lb car, I average about 27 MPG on pure Highway.  The City mileage suffers a little more, with a return of an average of 18 mpg.  But I am not complaining.
The suspension is very cool.  When you are going 55 or better on the highway, the suspension automatically lowers about an 1 inch, for better aerodynamics.  Also with the LSC you get a stiffer suspension, witch is fairly stiff, the non-LSC is more Town car like. With Z-rated tires, it sticks like glue, I can go 45 mph around 90 deg corners, with ease.  
I am a big guy (6ï¿½3, 250lbs) and the front seats are very comfortable, and the backs are a little cramped, but do able.  The interior is very cool with the &quot;cockpit&quot; style dash.  
So if you are in the market for a full size Luxury coupe, and want a lot for your money, give the Mark a try.
