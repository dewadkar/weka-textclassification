            In 1993, as our family was leaving for Europe, we had to make a quick decision on new transportation.  After talking to several people that were living in our area, Toyota became the name we needed to go with, because of the availability of servicing.  So we quickly bought a 1992 Toyota Camry Dealer car.  We fell in love with it immediately.  While overseas, we maintained oil changes at a rate higher than recommended by Toyota, and changed the tires, but no other maintenance was performed.  Five years later, upon the arrival of the car back from overseas, we had the car completely changed with fluid and flush and the mechanics were astounded at the perfection of the engine.  Now with 90,000+ miles, she still purrs like a brand new baby. My only complaints are few, mostly on the features that I did not get on the car.  That the air conditioner lost it's seal within a few months of purchase (this was stated due to pressure changes of having it shipped overseas), but has been remedied by installation of the new air conditioning system.  And the brakes squeak, and it's not the chirpers, and there seems to be just a fault with the car, but it just bugs me, that such a nice car, with such excellent performance should sound so harsh.  Our overall love for the car, has made us Toyota believers, my husband purchased a Toyota Tacoma and I am anxiously awaiting my daughter's sixteenth birthday to hand over the Camry, for our purchase of an Avalon.<br><br>
