            The first question I usually get from people is what does VALKYRE stand for. Since Illinois only allows you seven letters I have to spell Valkyrie as Valkyre. I've often been asked if it's a girls name, Or the mythical Norse Goddess. Some people ask if it is the Honda Superbike. Many have asked if it refers to the Richard Wagner Opera (Ring of the Niebelwufer). One gentleman (a serious student of history) asked if I knew about the plot to assassinate Hitler (Operation Valkyrie). 

Actually the car is named after a plane. In the late fifties scientists at NACA (The agency that NASA became) developed an idea for a radical &quot;compression lift&quot; aircraft. This aircraft relied on its shape to &quot;surf&quot; its own shockwave. This procedure allowed the aircraft to reach heights and speeds never before obtained in an aircraft so large and heavy. The XB-70A1 aircraft and its predessessor the A2 were capable of Mach 3 plus speeds. This plane was capable of out running every fighter aircraft then designed. 

My involvement with the Valkyrie came in 1969. By that time only one of these aircraft was still flying. The decision was made for NASA to retire the aircraft. My family was going through Ohio and we saw the aircraft coming in for a landing. 

Try to image an aircraft that was larger than the Boeing 747 coming in for a landing. This plane looks like a huge white dinosaur (long tapered neck). It's engines produce a growl that was amazing to hear. Needless to say when I looked at this beautiful sportscar and heard it growl....
