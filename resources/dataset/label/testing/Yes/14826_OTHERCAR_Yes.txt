                Hello all...welcome to one of the most comprehensive reviews on this fine machine Mazda calls the Protege. First thing i should say is that after test driving various cars in this price range(Civic, neon, corolla)it was very easy to make my decision to get my Protege. I now have 32,000 miles on and it to my suprise, it rides even better than it did when I rolled it out of the showroom. My opinion is, if you can get the Es w/ the 1.8 liter 122hp engine, GO FOR IT! This car in my opinion blows away the very popular Civic in every manner. The 1.8 liter is silky smooth, quite powerful, and is whisper quite at highway cruising speeds up to and beyond 80mph! One thing that alot of 4 cylinder engines lack is the passing power on parkways when avoiding slow goers and big land boats cruising down the parkway for a sunday drive. Well, I have to say that this little 4 banger has more than enough passing power to satisfy most people and I even sometimes forget that I have a 4 cylinder, not a 6 under the hood. Gas mileage is fantastic considering i live in NY with crazy traffic. I get about 24-26mpg locally and I just got 35mpg on a trip down to Atlantic city while doing 75mph! MAN I LOVE THIS CAR!
   Handling is unreal in this car too. Mazda uses technologies in the Protege in which the rear wheels partially steer with the front. It is not linked with the steering, the wheels just &quot;toe&quot; out slighty when making sharp turns. SO far I have never lost traction nor have I even been able to make the tires screech on a sharp turn.
   In terms of reliability, I only had one problm with the car yet. It happened very shortly after getting it. Seems like some idiot knocked one of the brake pad pins loose when they put the alloys on..I wont hold the car accountable for that one. One thing very important though is to follow the manual on what mileage to get things done. It will keep your Protege trouble free for years to come.
   SO to wrap things up here....Protege kicks butt! its a comfortable, quiet, zippy car...seats are great, its roomy inside, and you wont be accused of being a follower in this car. It is very original looking and original performing too...By the way, mines a 98, 99/2000 is different looking...my friend just got a 99...Its even better than mine if u can imagine that.<br><br>
