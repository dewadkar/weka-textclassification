            I highly recommend buying this car.  When I purchased my Le Sabre, I liked the burgandy color but didn't know much more about the car.  When I took it out for a test drive, I was impressed with how comfortable it rode.  
My husband and I both liked the different thermostats that were available for the passenger seat.  I am always cold and he is always HOT.  I can turn my gauge up and be comfortable.  I also like that I know the temperature that is outside of my vehicle.  The thermometer is very accurate.
My nephew has a Cadillac North star, and I would put my Buick up to his car anytime.  The comfort with both leg room and riding far surpasses his car.
This past November, I was rear ended and much to my surprise, the car was
not damaged.  The collapsible bumper protected both the car and me the passenger.  Buy Buick is my motto. <br><br>
