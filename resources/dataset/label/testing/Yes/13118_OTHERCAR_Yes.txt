            O.k.  I'm back from yet another long trip.  This time, I spent more time a car than usual.  I was given a 1999 Chevrolet Lumina.  I had to drive about three hours to my training, and then about 20 miles per day while I was at my training (to and from the hotel, and to dinner), and then back to my home.  In all, I drove about 500 miles in five days.  I had the experience of driving the Lumina in heavy rain, dry roads, day and night, highway, and local roads and in light and heavy traffic conditions.  

I first noticed that the Lumina was very comfortable.  The power and acceleration were smooth, yet aggressive.  From a stop, the car accelerated quickly, but I did not fell as though I was out of control.  The ride was smooth, and very quiet (hardly any road or engine noise).  The Lumina got pretty good mileage.  I think I travelled about 100 or so miles on a quarter tank of gas (about 3.5 Gal).  In all, I used about 20 gallons, and drove about 490-500 miles.  If you are doing the math, that's about 24.5 GPM (keep in mind that I had the air conditioner on the whole time, too and that the numbers reflect a variety of driving conditions, just like the real world).  The rear seat did comfortably seat three people.  The stereo delivered a clear, and crisp sound, that was a delight on a 3 1/2 hour solo drive.  In all, the Lumina was very nice to drive.  

However, I did find a few problems.  First, I noticed that the Lumina felt top-heavy.  When I went around a tight curve (on/off ramp), I felt like I was about to loose control, and the car felt like it was leaning too much for my tastes.  If you like to push the envelope (not that I would <i>ever</i> suggest that), this is <i>not</i> the car for you.  While the acceleration may be exciting, a tight turn (even at the posted safety speed on the on ramps, as with my experience) is not suggested.  I also heard a whistling sound coming from the right rear at one point, but could not located the source.  The comfortable seats, soft ride, and quiet interior, while nice, also have a draw back.  I almost fell asleep at the wheel.

In any case, I liked the 1999 Chevy Lumina, and I would suggest it, if you are a diehard Chevy fan.  The nice features, clearly outweigh the negatives.<br><br>
