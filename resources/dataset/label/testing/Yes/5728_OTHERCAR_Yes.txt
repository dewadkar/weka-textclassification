            My first as well as current car is a plymouth acclaim and I must say it has been good to me.  Sure, occasionally, it has stalled on me in the winter time and i had a few problems, btu all in all it has been good.  It is a 92 so it is quite old so some of the things, liek the horn, have gone dead, but it runs really well and is very good at speed. It's a V6, but yet it isn't a gas guzzler.  It has great gas mileage and great accleration.  It may not look very powerful, but it really.  I'd recommend it as a first car to anybody, it's good in the winter as well as summer.<br><br>
