            We bought a 2000 Venture LT (extended), fully loaded (got every upgrade except the self sealing tires).  We love the thing, but now we've had a problem.  It started at about 2,500 miles.  The transmission would slip between 30 and 50 MPH.  Very hard to notice at first.   The it got progressively worse.

Finally, at 8,000 miles it was so bad it felt like the tranny was going to fall out at times.  We just got it back from the dealer after they had it for nine days.  The end result was a new transmission.  The original one &quot;failed.&quot;

I have to say that the dealer provided great service. They called me every night with an update and provided me a loaner van.

Still though, this is a little disconcerting.  I'm hoping this will be the last problem we have.  I extended the warranty to 6 years/60,000 miles for an extra $600 when I bought it.  I hope I don't need to use it, but at least I'm covered for a while.

It really is a nice vehicle.  Only the Windstar had better acceleration.  Other than the Windstar, the Venture is the only mini-van I would buy, only because these two have ample power to get you up and moving with the flow of traffic.  All the other we test drove were road hazards due to their lacking powertrain.

The only other problem we've had is with the power sliding door.  I think they're having a lot of problems with the power door  because the dealer couldn't duplicate our problem, but he said he knew what it was because he'd seen quite a few in the shop with a similar complaint.

I also just saw that the seatbelts are being recalled in some Ventures, due to improper manufacturing, which could lead to failure under stress.<br><br>
