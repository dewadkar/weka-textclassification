            Let me first say that I don't own this vehicle. I am thinking of trading my car in for something more economical, so I test drove the GLS TDI (diesel) Beetle. I had the car for a week, and it was wonderful. 

The TDI Beetle gets between 45 and 50 mpg on the highway, and this was a HUGE plus for me, as I commute to work and drive 25+ miles each way. When I first looked at it, I thought it was completely adorable, but I was afraid it would feel small on the road and I'd get buffeted around by semis. Not true! It has quite a hefty weight for a compact car - almost 2900 pounds. So, it felt very solid and I never felt like I was in a tiny car.  

I also had reservations about the back seat. I don't want to take any long road trips with tall adults in the back, but I want to be able to seat them back there for short trips. I also wanted ample room for kids, which my 3000GT didn't have. Suffice it to say I was VERY impressed when I took 3 guys from work to lunch in it, all of them over 6', and they fit fine. When you're getting in the back, the front seats fold forward, and then the bottom of the seat tilts up to provide even more room. The seat moves completely out of the way, and leaves more than enough room to get in. 

I was also very impressed with the quality of the leather seats (nice and supple) and all the extras on this model. Things like side airbags, heated front seats, and reading lights in the back are not typical of a compact car. 

I had only 2 dislikes: the trunk is quite small. The opening is oddly shaped, so it is difficult to get bulky items in it. The back seats fold down, so that provides more space for hauling big stuff. I would have bought this car straight off if I hadn't had reservations about this. I'm going to test drive the Jetta (same mpg with the diesel) and then decide which one I like the best. Also, the sun visor is not very useful on the side windows. They are so big and the visor doesn't have an extender, so it only covers the front third of the window. I've seen people with  small sheets of tint over the top rear half of the window, because of this. I hope there are after-market accessories you can get to add the extension to the visor. 

Other than that, the car was great. Very solid ride, much better than expected, and good pickup. The diesel was not loud or smoky. I will probably end up buying this car in the next few months. If so, I'll write an update after a year or so and let everyone know about its reliability. 

UPDATE: I test drove the 2001 Jetta and ended up buying it for the following reasons: it gets the same great fuel economy, is about the same price, and for the same price you get 4 doors and a relatively huge trunk. It was a very difficult decision though. <br><br>
