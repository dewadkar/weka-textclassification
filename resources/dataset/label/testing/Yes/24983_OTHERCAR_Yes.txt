            Right up front I want to say...I LOVE THIS JEEP!  I redundantly mentioned poor gas mileage in the cons because I am lucky to get 20MPG out of it, but I knew this when I bought so I'm not going to complain about it.   It's a Jeep, and "Jeep" and "Economical" don't normally appear in the same sentence.

As of the writing of this review I've had the Jeep for 3 months and am approaching the 3,000-mile marker.  I mention this so that you know I've been driving this car for a while now.  People have complained about the seats being uncomfortable and I even mentioned that it rides a little high in the saddle when you first start driving it.  But I think that has alot to do with the fact that most people have gotten so used to their old vehicles, that any new one will feel a little uncomfortable until you've used it for a while.  After 3 months of driving this vehicle I no longer feel like it's uncomfortable to drive, and I've done a 300-mile trip in this vehicle.  I feel quite the opposite actually, I think it handles quite well and rides very smooth by Jeep standards.

I mentioned "plenty of room for driver" in the Pros; that's because I'm 6'2" tall with a 54" chest and weigh nearly 285lbs, which makes me "husky" to say the least.  I don't fit in most cars, so finding one that I say "has plenty of room for the driver" means something.  I will say that if you're much taller than me--watch out--especially if you get a sunroof (it lowers the internal available height).

I got just about every option on the planet on this Jeep but I have to say that the most impressive feature is actually a standard--I LOVE the trunk layout and the trunk remote.  I hit the button and the back glass pops up--and the glass is independent of the door.  The glass pops up to a height of over 6' so when it's raining I can actually be messing around in my trunk and be out of the rain..NICE!  I can also keep the glass up to allow items that just don't fit in the Jeep to extend out the back.

It looks like a Jeep, drives like a Jeep, but it's very smooth compared to the roughness of a Jeep Wrangler.  It has electric everything and feels secure on the road.  I've only had to drop it into 4WD once, so I haven't really tested it in deep snow or off-road yet, which is one of the reasons I chose a Jeep.
