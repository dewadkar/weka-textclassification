  My Cavalier was used when I bought it. I bought it two years old, and it was in great shape. It had about 30,000 miles on it at the time, and it now has 70,000 or more. I wanted a car that looked stylish, but I also wanted a car good on gas, and not to expensive. The cavalier fit all my needs so I drove it to its new home.

The Features~~

My car the basics, I have no power windows or seats. It does have a cassette player, A/C, tilt steering, power mirrors, alloy wheels, I can't tell you about the engine because I have no clue. It is a tan two door coupe, that looks real sporty. 

Quality~~

The car has never broke down on me. We did have to replace some fuel lines that froze, but that is about it. I do all my basic repairs and the car is terrific. I think this will be a car to last a lot longer than the warranty. Although, maybe that is the plan!! 

In general this is one of chevy's nicest cars. It drives real smooth, and is really good on gas. It has a 15 gallon tank. Most cars this size only have a 10 gallon tank so it seems like the gas is sucked up alot faster. This car is worth test driving any time. Keep this car, which is great on gas, low maintenance, and nice in apperance when you go look for that new car.
