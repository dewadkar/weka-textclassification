            I hope that I can be of some help to some of you that are considering buying a larger vehicle.  I have a family of five with my newest addition of a 10-month-old son.  I knew that I was in desperate need of a larger vehicle but was not sure what I wanted to buy.  I did not go out searching for a mini van because I felt that I was not a minivan person.  However when I went to my neighborhood ford dealership I saw the windstar and thought well that doesn�t look too bad.  So just for the heck of it I decided that I would take it for a test drive.    Wow was I amazed.  I realized that it didn�t drive like a bus that I had imagined it to be.  It actually drove better than the Jeep Cherokee that I currently had.  This vehicle drives so smoothe that when you hit a bump in the road or go over a speed bump, which I�m sure that we all have, it seems to glide  right over it. 
I have now driven it in the snow as well as in the rain and I have to say that it is perfect.  As far as the room inside the Windstar, I am so pleased that I can put 2 car seats inside with great ease as well as my five year old in the back, fill the van up with groceries a few dolls and atleast one truck and still have plenty of room for us to all sit comfortably.  The gas mileage is also very good.  I usually average about 25 miles to the gallon with normal every day driving.  Also better than my Jeep.  I have now owned my Windstar for 9 months and I have to honestly say that as of yet I have no complaints to report.
I would not have gone searching for a Windstar or any other van for that matter but I am certainly glad that I ended up with one. 
I hope that this helps you out with your search
Kerri
