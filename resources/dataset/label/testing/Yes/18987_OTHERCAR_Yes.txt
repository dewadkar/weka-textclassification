                 I'm finally getting around to reviewing the 2003 GT-V6 Automatic Tiburon, which I own. I now have 41,389 miles on her and I still love the car.

     I do not claim to be an expert about sports cars, having only owned a '74 Triumph Spitfire 1500 in my youth. Before that, what I owned were American muscle cars. Due to excessive speeding tickets I eventually ended up owning several Volkswagens, beginning with the Rabbit.

     I don't consider the Tiburon to be a sports car, per se, but it is a darned fun car to drive! Much more fun and a heck of a lot more dependable than the Spitfire, too!!

What I like:

   1. It was very affordable. I don't like moon roofs or sunroofs, as a rule, so I didn't buy the car with one. However, I loved the amount of standard features for the price.
   2. It's a blast to drive. Some complain that the steering isn't as communicative as they'd like. I think that is somewhat expected, as the car is front-weighted a bit more than your typical sporty coupe with a four banger. 
I think the car is a bit more challenging to drive fast through the twisties and hence, involves a bit more effort from the driver than the lighter cars. I enjoy that, personally. I have enhanced the suspension a bit, adding a larger sway bar and strut supports, and it's made a noticeable difference for less than $300.
   3. I get comments weekly from other drivers...all of which are good. And that's after 1 1/2 years! The car looks great and more expensive than it is.
   4. Emergency maneuvers in this car are predictable and easily controlled. I don't have ABS or traction control, but have yet to lock up the wheels or encounter any problems, even when braking hard for the occasional bad driver or loose ball. The car brakes quickly and doesn't veer to either side while doing so.
   5. Reliability. The car gets 22-city/28 highway mpg, averaging 350 miles to a tank. I burn no detectable oil between oil changes, which I perform at 5,000-mile intervals using 100% synthetic oil.
   6. Quality fit and finish. So far, I have developed none of the usual squeaks and rattles. The car feels as solidly assembled as it did the day I drove it home new. By now, my VWs would be creaking and moaning and my GM vehicles were literally starting to look a little ragged inside and out.


What I don't like:

   1. Hyundai needs to work harder to improve its dealer network. If there were anything I'd want to improve about Hyundai, that's it. Too many dealers are discourteous and lacking in knowledge about the product they are selling. There needs to be more mandatory training for dealer sales and, especially, service staff.
   2. More emphasis on paint thickness and proper application. Hyundai purportedly uses state of the art paint and equipment. The biggest complaints I've heard from other owners has concerned paint chipping or being problematic in certain areas such as where the spoiler is attached.The only problem I personally have had with this car concerns the paint. The rocker panels below the passenger doors are made of plastic and the paint from the factory did not adhere very well to these. I had them repainted under warranty.
   3. Make the cup holders more conforming to American cup and can sizes, vs. Korean.

Beyond that, I can't think of anything else I don't like. 
Some might expect me to complain about the cramped rear seat, but really!? It's not a family car, you know!!

   I wholeheartedly recommend this to older drivers who want to experience more exhilaration in their daily drive with the added benefit of being able to stand out from the crowd. I would not recommend the car as a first car for a teenager. Too many other young drivers want to challenge you to race due to the Tiburon's sexy lines and sometimes, just the fact that it's a Hyundai. I can resist such foolishness, but a teen with even the slower four-cylinder motor will find it hard to resist the attention and challenges this car causes.
