            Just before Thanksgiving 2000, I started doing some research on digital cameras.  I was ready to buy, but didn't know what I should get.  Go low ($250) and end up with a 1 megapixel camera that would be very short on features?  Or go high ($750) and be overwhelmed with knobs, dials and considerable bulk? Neither of those options were appealing so I split the difference and clicked away for the Canon Powershot S100.  And you know what, it's the best electronic gadget I've purchased in some time. Here's why.

Engineering:
The Digital Elph is truly a marvel.  The all stainless steel case sets it apart from most digicams.  Although it weighs in at a minuscule 7 oz. (without battery and CF card), it feels sturdy.  You can tell there's some serious electronics inside the thing.  About the size of a pack of cigarettes, the Elph is currently the smallest Mpixel camera around.  Which leads us to...

Usability:
Unlike the bulky, plastic cameras out there, you'll slip this beauty in your pocket or purse and not worry about it turning on or breaking.  That's due in part to the lack of anything protruding from the camera.

Features:
2.1 Mpixel CCD.  Although you can spend a bit more and get 3 Mpixels, 2 is adequate for most electronic prints and you can get a decent 8x10 print with a newer ink-jet and good photo paper.

2X optical zoom.  Alright, the zoom is a bit weak as there are other digicams in this price range that offer 3X.  It's also a tad difficult to control precisely.  Digital zoom modes of 2X and 4X are also available.  Powerful flash for such a tiny camera, with a flash recharge time of 10 seconds or so.  Macro mode works very well, especially with a small tripod.  Great for you e-auction addicts.

1.5" LCD display.  The camera does have a very good optical viewfinder that can be used to save on battery life, but most users will really enjoy using the LCD to frame, shoot and review photos.  Four smallish buttons below the LCD are used to navigate the menus and choose settings.  It takes some time to get comfortable with the various icons and whatnot.  The display itself is darn good, bright, and has a non-reflective coating.  Small perk, it shows the entire photo, unlike others that crop some of the image.

USB and CF:
USB is faster and easier than serial.  An 8MB Compact Flash card is included.  Most users will need to buy a lager capacity card.  This is true for most digicam packages anyway.

Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery pack with charger:
The recharge time is two hours from a completely depleted state.  Not bad.  Others have mentioned that the battery life is short, and it can be if you rely heavily on the LCD.  It is fun to look at the pictures and pass the camera around, though.  Included is a Video-out cable that can be used to show the images on a TV.  I've heard of some people using the camera as a low-end webcam device with third party software and the proper video card, but I have not tried this.

Features I wish it had:
An AC adapter would have been nice to include.  Stronger zoom, too.  In a penny-pinching move, Canon didn't even include a case, unless you care to use the little bubble wrap the camera came in.  Image-wise, the camera has a tendency toward red-eye and the included red-eye reduction mode doesn't work very well.  
 
After using this camera for more than 4 months, I have found it to be the point-and-shoot digicam to have.  I've taken more pictures in that time than I probably did over the last two years.  No, it's not a pro-level camera in terms of image quality and manual options, but with it's size and good set of features, you'll always be able to get an acceptable shot.  Plus, the camera itself looks so cool, I feel slightly self-conscious using it in public, as heads always turn.
