            I was looking for a 4 wheel drive that was also a ragtop, and a Porche Carrera 4 was out of the question.

I knew nothing about jeeps and never was even in one before i bought mine.  I did not test drive either; did not want to find out i did not want one before it was too late !

I chose black for the color because the trim, particularly the top and door frames, look best because they are black on all models.

I also chose (and it?s a tough choice) the full doors with glass windows.  You do feel much more closed in with the tall doors, because the plastic half windows come with a door that only comes up to your elbow.  The half doors certainly look better too; but I spend too much of my life in drive through lines to be zipping and unzipping all of the time..

I also chose the 4 cylinder because it was lighter, and especially because of the better gas mileage.  I?m lucky to get 18 all around, and I know of a friend with the 6 cylinder who just makes a sad face when he talks about gas..

I love the view over the hood, and the ride and handling are fine.  A little bumpy, but you get used to it, and it?s the same bumpy no matter what you run over.  These days, curbs, bumper blocks, ditches, etc. are just normal road objects to me.  The short turning circle is handy; im quite spoiled now with U turns. 

There is no space inside the thing, and the noise level on the highway with the soft top is a joke; I cant even use my cell phone on a breezy day.

I got a kit to move the side view mirrors forward so that I could remove the doors entirely.  It?s a simple job to remove them (I just tossed the hinge bolts out ) and its really the best feeling driving with the doors and windows out, but the top up for a sunshade. 

All in all, im happy with the car but my life supports it.  I think it would be much better as a second vehicle for most people.  If I need to go a distance, ill have to rent a car, cause after a few hundred miles in the Jeep, id be pretty sad.  It?s a really nice machine to have on a sunny or snowy day; and they really seem to hold their value well.  

In a nutshell; its fun, its handy sometimes, but it?s not a really a car.  Its more like a closed in dirt bike with a radio, and its fun almost all of the time, except on long freeway jaunts.  It is not too cheap, but it holds value.  Insurance is normal, and nothing has broken yet.  I do notice that many older ones have rusted pretty badly, so I don?t plan to keep it for more than a year or three?.
