                 I purchased my 1986 RX-7 used in the winter of 2000(3 years ago). It's a GXL model, which is basically a turbo model without the turbo. They came with electronic suspension control, 5 lug wheels, 4 piston brake calipers, and assorted other goodies. Mine also has a moonroof, cruise, power windows, and a few other little options. 
     If you ever get a chance to drive one of these(not ride in, DRIVE) BE CAREFUL. You will fall in love. It happened to me. 
     These cars are fantastic. They corner like you wouldn't believe, they accelerate like they have alot more than 160 hp under the hood, and are as stable as any rear wheel drive I've ever driven. 
     It takes ALOT of punishment to get the tail to swing, and when it does, it's very easy to control. Normally, it just slingshots you around the corners. Yet, it feels rock solid at 80+mph. 
     The cockpit is well thought out, with controls in logical positions, and within easy reach. The seats are very comfortable and easily adjustable. The side bolsters hold you firmly in place. My car has the notorious "rear seat" option. It's been used on occasion, but really it serves mostly as a place to put things I want in easy reach (CD case, book bag, etc.). 
     Now for the cons, 
    Parts are ridiculiously expensive. They're usually impossible to find locally, which forces you to order from the internet, which in turn forces you to wait for the UPS man before you can drive your precious baby again. If you're lucky, and the part isn't on backorder. 
    If you're looking at buying an RX-7 with more than 100k miles on it, figure on having the engine rebuilt fairly soon. Mine has gone 156k without a rebuild, but it has definitely lost some performance. Luckily, this is usually a reasonably priced procedure, if you can find someone who knows rotary engines. The engines only have 4 moving parts, so a rebuild is much simpler than with a conventional engine. 
    If you have the patience, this is a very rewarding car. It would be great for a backyard mechanic or tinkerer. Just be ready to put some time and money into it.
