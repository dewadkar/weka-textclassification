            I bought my 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse in 1997.  The model I have, is the model with turbo and all wheel drive.  When I bought it people told me that the car would be nothing but trouble and that the turbo would fail and I would end up paying about 4000 to fix it.  Well, it has been three years and none of those things have happened.  The only problems I have had with it thus far are:

Frozen trunk lock
Bad wheel bearing
Bad spark plugs

After about 60000 miles the wheel bearing went bad, and one cold winter the trunk lock got all messed up, and after 70000 they had to replace the original spark plugs.  All of this was covered under my general extended warranty except for the spark plugs.  I would recommend that you replace them yourself.  It was a little too expensive to have them replaced.  

Also as long as I lay off the turbo I can get a little over 30 miles to the gallon.  Now, laying off the turbo is not the easiest thing.  It often tries to engage in first gear.  This is possibly where it gets messed up for people and requires them to have to replace it.  However, if you are able to keep the turbo to a minimum in first gear I do not think that you will have nay problems with this car.

Another thing to mention is that the tires I have on it are very expensive ones.  They run about 200 dollars a piece.  This might have something to do with my great gas mileage, but I am not sure.  In any case these tires are great.  I have only had to replace one and that was because I ran over some big piece of metal.  The tread is still great on them and they are about 40000 miles old.  These tires are also great in the winter.  I spend my winters in West Virginia on top of a mountain.  Unless you are from Colorado then I spend it on top of a hill.  In any case, it is snowy and icy at least once every winter and I have never gotten stuck.  The all wheel drive is quality.

To mention a con to this car is that the back seats are not comfy at all.  If you plan on hauling around more than two people then DO NOT get this car.  The people in the back will be crammed.  However, if you just sometimes haul people around then this will be a great car.  The people in the back will complain a bit, but if it is only now and then that they are complaining you will be ok.

To conclude this epinion I will leave you with this.  The 1995 Eclipses are way under priced right now in my opinion.  I see myself getting at least 100000 more miles out of this car.  It has a durable body, I hit a deer and had no damage, it runs good and as long as I stay off turbo I get great gas mileage.  Which right now is very important. 

Now, I may have just gotten a great version of this car when in fact they are all lemons.  But I can only speak to what I know, and I know that my 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse is great.<br><br>
