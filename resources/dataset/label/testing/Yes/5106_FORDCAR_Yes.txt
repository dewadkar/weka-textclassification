                 First off, let me say I am a 22 yr old married girl with a 3 year old son. I wanted a really fast car, something I could customize to look real hot. But, my husband wouldn't buy me what I wanted. He wanted the safest car around, so he bought a white 1997 Ford Taurus GL used with 21,000 miles on it. 

     I have never had a newer car before so it was great for me even though I hated the look of it. The 145hp is not what I want... looking for at least 250hp or more.  The car has awesome space in it. I can not complain about that. My only complaints are that the transmission blew around 55,000 miles. The repair shop rebuilt it and it cost 2 grand. The guy asked my husband who the heck was driving the car (which was me), because I snapped something completely in half. He said it looked like someone drove it like a race car.

     Where I live, all the kiddies cruise down Gratiot practically every single night of the year. Showing off their Mustangs, Neons, Civics, etc.. and racing at every light. Now I know I can't beat the Mustangs, but theres nothing greater than pulling up my grocery getter with a car seat in the back, to a car full of little kiddies in a really suped up Neon, Cavalier, Sunfire, or Civic... with 4ft wings and fart cans 6 inches wide, tons of graphics and body kits - LOOKING like they are really fast and beating the crap out of them at every light. It's quite funny.

     But back to the point, the transmissions suck. Sometimes the interior lights won't go out, so I had to take the lights out under the floor boards and keep the dome light off. The back left window will not roll down anymore. The weather strip on the passenger window is coming apart so its kinda noisy when driving on the expressway.  I hate that you can't really use the cigerette lighter (to plug things in) when the arm rest is open. It sucks cause I have a lot of neons to plug in. The paint in the front of the car is starting to spider web, and I'm just awaiting the day that it starts peeling off. It seems like we have to replace the brakes every couple of months. 

     And the biggest downfall for me is that there are almost zero aftermarket parts for this car. I have tinted the windows completely black which looks hot with the white car. I replaced the antenna with a short black sporty one, put on Ventshades around the windows, and blackouts for my headlights. I got some shiny rims, green underbody neons, and a million neons inside the car. I've put on valve stem lights, windshield washer lights, K & N air filter, cold air intake, tornando, and I think thats about it. All that with a car seat in the back. 
So after 4 years I finally like my car. Its got 106,000 miles on it though. I hope it'll last for a lot longer. Now just waiting till the day in 2004 I can con my husband into buying me the Subaru Impreza WRX Sti. 300 hp baby!!!
