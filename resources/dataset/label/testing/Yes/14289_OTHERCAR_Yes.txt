            I purchased my 1997 Toyota Paseo Convertible a year ago. I've had many adventures (both good and bad), that leads me to believe I can provide an accurate representation of this vehicle.

<b>To Like or To Dislike: That is the Question</b>

I purchased my car in March of 2002 from a used car dealership. On my initial test-drive I was very impressed with the car. It sported a spoiler, silver rims, automatic windows and door locks, cd/tape deck, air-conditioning, heater and abs brakes among many other features.

My car tends to average about 28 mpg or 320 miles per tank. 

The car drives smoothly, even though it is very low to the ground. The cars controls are perfectly positioned for easy access while driving.

With 92,000 miles on the car there has never been any problem with the engine during my ownership, or with the car as far as I know. The oil does not burn or leak which is impressive since all my previous cars have had some sort of oil problem.

To my dismay within 2 days of purchasing the vehicle, it rained and the driver and passenger seats were soaked thoroughly. Water also leaked onto the electrical components. I immediately took the car back to the dealership. The roof has been repaired twice - yet everytime it rains my car leaks. My fear, still to this day, is that the automatic windows and locks will stop working. I have heard from many other Paseo owners that this is a common problem with the convertible version of the car. My advice would be to possibly buy the non-convertible version of the car.

The Paseos bucket seats are fairly comfortable, but after long drives the seats start to become uncomfortable. The car is also mostly a 2 seater. It can not comfortably fit 4 adults.

The Paseo offers very limited trunk space as well, though not really a problem for me.

<b>Great Expectations</b>

I can not honestly say the car has lived up to my expectations. As far as the "Toyota means quality," statement I agree with that <b>when</b> it applies to the engine.

As far as the convertible version of the car, I would have to advise to go with the non-convertible version of the car as I have heard and experienced to many problems relating to the top.

<b>To Buy or Not to Buy</b>

I think this car (non-convertible version) would make a great first car for a girl. You can find many of the '97 Paseos for under $8,000. It is reliable, fun to drive, sporty and is often mistaken for being a newer 2002 model car. Avoid the convertible version at all costs.

I bought this car because I was looking for something girly and sporty looking, but I didn't want to pay $20,000. The Paseo met all of my qualifications and only had a $10,000 price tag.
