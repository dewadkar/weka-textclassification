            I have been in the body shop business for many years now, writing up mostly high end passenger cars, but also doing brisk business with Toyota pickups and 4Runners. We have always liked working on them because they are logically constructed and even those nearly totalled always come out like new.

My car of choice has always been a high performance sports sedan and I have been driving a Ford SHO for years now, with an El Camino for my home rebuilding project. I have gotten used to high performance and a lot of bells and whistles, but it became evident that I had to off my two older cars and get one new one.

We had a few Tundras in the shop for body work and I thought that it was the truck I could live with and maybe afford, unlike a Ford Lightning which is clearly a very interesting vehicle, but just too much for me to own.

So, there I am, down at the dealer and I see one I like, one that exites me; a black V8 Access Cab with ABS, upgraded stereo, alloys, privacy glass and a tow hitch. Shaking some, because I hate to go into debt, I make the deal and drive off. Oh, boy, what have I done!

This is what I have found so far:

Cab and interior: 
I am fairly big, 6.2, 200+, but the room is ample. My SHO seats were perfect for me, and I get to drive a lot of leather bucketed luxury cars, so I am spoiled. The Tundra seats, at least the split bench type like mine, are not of that quality, but are not bad. No sore back, etc. I do miss the electric adjustments that allow one to get the angles just right and the bolsters that hold you in, but in the latter case that would make it hard to get in and out of a tall truck.

The controls are logical, their operation intuitive. The stereo  is easy and safe to use. I miss automatic temperature control, but the AC and heater act very quickly and the compressor does not bog down the motor.

The interior trim is a bit hard and plasticy, especially the interior door trim panels. A soft-feel material would be nicer. 

The rear seat room is, of course, limited and best used as a place to store things under lock and key and to keep groceries from getting wet. Those with little kids or animals will find them useful, too. I like the extra room to scoot the seat back and set the recliner angle.

I have the upgraded tape/CD stereo.The sound quality is acceptable, but I would not mind a power, speaker and subwoofer upgrade. It is new and may loosen up some in time, though.

No rattles at all and little wind noise. Better than most expensive sedans in this regard.

Steering:
Solid and precise. Everyone says it is car-like and it is. The best cars are blessed with lowness, high performance tires and modern suspensions. No truck can really be called great-car-like, but this is not bad at all. A little more self-centering action would be nice. Some of this is due to newness and I have noticed it getting better with some mileage. 

Suspension:
You cannot expect sports sedan handling in a truck because it is impossible. Solid axles, leaf springs, high center of gravity, tall tires, etc. all conspire against Formula One handling. The ride is very good (the lack of rattles contributes to this). You can get rear axle hops and skips if you hit a pot hole while cornering. Someday, suspensions will be air/electric and leaf springs will finally disappear, but  until then Toyota has done what can be done in making good compromises. The Tundra handles in a predictable way. That is all you can ask for in an actual truck.

I have heard that there have been complaints about vibrations in some Tundras, but mine is smooth. My shop experience has shown me that 95% of all vibration problems in trucks are from bad wheel balance and out of round tires. This gets even worse with aftermarket tires, wheels, lift/lowering kits, &quot;heavy duty&quot; shocks and such.

Brakes:
Good firm pedal. The use of rear drums is a little surprising, but we will see. I have been carefully bedding in the brakes, so have not stressed them. Did test the ABS on a dirt road and the system seems to work as it should. 

Engine:
Everyone raves about the motor, and for good reason. Nothing wrong with it. Powerful  and torquey. Has a low rev limit for a 4-cam motor, so low and midrange power is what Toyota wanted. 

I would guess that people will put on aftermart exhausts as the pipe diameter seems surprisingly small (note the monster pipes on US trucks). It does sound good and because of that mileage may suffer as drivers get it up into the nice to listen to range more often than they should.

Engine compartment neat and organized. Your mechanic will like working on this. Compare to the mess found under the hoods of most domestic vehicles. 

Vehicles that are miserable to work on do not get repaired as quickly or as well at those that are properly designed with the tech in mind. It is interesting to note that vehicles with carefully designed mechanical layouts seem to be the ones that have good reputations for reliability. A coincidence? I don't think so. 

Transmission and axle:
A good, modern automatic. I would have preferred a manual, but....
Or a Porsche Tiptronic with controls on the steering column, but...

I have not carried any great load, so have not noticed the shifting strategy gaps others have complained about. I am afraid of the complexity and repair costs of modern automatics and hope Toyota has done their job in making this one reliable.

I think all pickups ought to have a limited slip rear differential (&quot;positraction&quot;). 

Workmanship and detail quality:
Cannot find a flaw of any sort. That is a good sign because it means that the truck was designed correctly and the workers do not have to  make things fit. 

Utility:
The load and towing capacity is fine for almost any purpose. Those that require huge loads should get an F350. Easy to fit a bed liner or a lumber rack. The bed seems very well braced. I like the lock that secures the gate.

A great truck is still not the same thing as a great car. I think that the Tundra is a truck that that you can live with, one that has some of the attributes that  you look for in any vehicle.
