            We bought our 2000 in January of this year.  It only had 6000 miles on it and we figured it would make a good run around vehicle (to work and back). I was pleasantly surprised when I first got in this car. Although generally I'm the only occupant, we do find the interior roomy and comfortable even with the whole family of 4 inside. My car is white with VERY dark windows which makes it look all the more sportier. The interior is a dark gray, almost black. I love this color. It still looks brand new and I've had the car 5 months. 

The engine is certainly peppy enough for what I need. I've driven my mom's Camry before and actually find it with less get up and go than my car. I live in AZ so air conditioning is a priority in a vehicle. This car cools down quicker than any I've ever owned. Granted, the tinted windows help, but the a/c unit is powerful and doesn't seem to drag the engine. I have a very basic model, and I do really miss the power windows, etc. But what's even more annoying is that there is no trunk latch by the drivers seat (arghhhh). So every time I need to open the trunk I have to get the keys out..etc.. Very annoying. I suppose that extra $5.00 part would have killed Dodge...I do like the split fold down seats in the back though. It makes it great for hauling things from the hardware store and the kids like hiding stuff back there as well....Speaking of the backseat..There's only one cupholder which is located on the inside of the top of the middle console. You use it by flipping the top open and to the back. Rather clever since it connects perfectly with the back seat, BUT they really should have designed two cup holders and not just one. For me, with two kids, it's virtually useless. (those of you who are parents will understand...)

All in all, this is a great car.
