            I've been lusting after a VW New Beetle since they came out in 1998.  Finally, in the summer of 2001, I bought one. I've never been happier with a car! It's cute, funky, zippy, fun to drive, and a real attention-getter.  It gets the best mileage of any car I've ever had.  Everyone wants to know how I like it when they find out what kind of car I have.  When I tell them it's a diesel, they're even more interested.  My bug's an automatic, and after 4 months of ownership I'm averaging about 42 MPG.  Standards have been know to get 50 MPG easily.  Great mileage and engines that last forever if you care for them properly!  My only complaints about this car so far are:

1. The terrible cupholders, which hold only cans -- a drive-through drink cup or a 20 oz soda bottle will NOT fit in any way.  (For those looking for a solution to this one, I bought an aftermarket door-installed cupholder from drinkholders.com.  Works great.)

2.  The very bright daytime running lights. They seem to run at about 90% of headlight brightness. There's no way to turn these things off.  Some say the headlights burn out much faster because the DRLs are on all the time.  (There's an aftermarket way around this too -- a switch used in European versions of the Beetle that allows you to turn off the DRLs.  I'm installing one.)

3.  Though I have not experienced them personally, many New Beetle owners report nagging problems like odd rattles, malfunctioning power windows, gas hatches that won't open, and batteries that die very prematurely.  Avoiding the 1998-99 model years seems to help, as the later models seem to have fewer such problems. Be aware, however, that many folks continue to report these odd little glitches that VW doesn't seem to be able to fix.  

The wide flat front nose is prone to highway damage by rocks and debris kicked up by trucks, etc., but a car bra will defend against that problem.  You may find yourself washing this car a lot more often because most colors don't look good dirty... but if you love this car, you won't mind much.

These quibbles aside, I'm thoroughly happy with this car.  It's got more than enough power (and in fact I need to watch myself on the highway to avoid speeding).  It's surprisingly roomy, too.  My 6'7" husband fits in it quite comfortably and loves to drive it.  The stock stereo sounds great, the interior is very attractive, and the little bud vase is a cute touch. Even the trunk is big enough for routine uses.   The New Beetle was rated extremely high in its class for crash safety, and retains a high resale value -- two more pluses.  I'd recommend the 2001 New Beetle to anyone with a sense of fun who wants a terrific little car.
