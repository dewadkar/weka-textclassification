            I bought the 1999 Ranger when I was in desperate need of a Automobile.  I went to the Ford dealer closest to me and took the cheapest truck on the lot. I have owned my ranger for 18 months and drive it on a daily basis.  
I like the way that it handles and the fact that for a small truck it has a little get up and go. Many people told me that I would have trouble in the winter due to the light weight in the rear of the vehicle. I find just the opposite. Due to the light weight of the entire vehicle I find that with a couple of tubes of sand in the back I can get around in just about any midwestern snowstorm. If you are looking for a smooth comfortable ride do NOT buy the &quot;Basic&quot; Ranger. On the highway it seems to have a lot of road noise and you feel the every aspect the road has to offer. And I mean that literally.  The Cab is slightly cramped for me and my wife. We are both 5'11 and have the seat to the back window.  There seems to be plenty of head room. I have only hit mine once on the roof and that was on a speed bump I failed to notice. Ouch!  

    Like I stated before I bought the cheapest truck the dealer had on the lot. It is not 4X4 nor is it extended cab.It does however have a air conditioner and a CD player. The CD player has never skipped and the air will freeze Polar bears out once you get going. Everyone has the price of gas in mind these days, well my ranger averages 27 miles to the gallon on unleaded. One of the things that I like the most about the Basic Ranger is the fact that that I can get into tight places to park. Also I have taken it off road several times. It bounces like a Basket ball but I've only gotten stuck once. The vehicle is so light weight a friend and I just got out and picked the rear end up, Moved it over and went on our way.  

Some of the downsides of the Ranger are as I stated earlier the cab size, The way it rides on the highway, Now don't get me wrong it handles well it just rides rough. But the most annoying thing I have notice is the fact that Ford painted the undercoating white so every little scratch shows like a light bulb.

I would recommend this vehicle for single people,newlyweds on a tight budget, or couples who do NOT have children.  I would not feel comfortable trying to get three persons into the small cab.  
I would not recommend this vehicle for families or anyone wanting to do heavy hauling or long distance traveling.
