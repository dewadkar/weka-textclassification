            A few weeks ago I was doing a shoot for an artist friend who was working on a brochure. I borrowed this particular camera from a friend for the shoot. I was completely sold and immediately loyal when the first image appeared on my computer screen. Not only were the pictures crisp, clear and precise to the subject -- they were better. I was astonished that a point-and-shoot camera could perform this well. I was shooting drawer pulls, custom designed drawer pulls that needed to look sharp.

I can honestly say that the pictures actually brought out details of shadow and design that I didn't see with the naked eye. Every shot was a perfect shot (barring the occasional glitch of bad composition on my part).

The only shortcoming that I have detected is that I personally prefer a viewer over an lcd -- it makes me feel more &quot;photographer like&quot; and more in control of the composition.

If you don't want to wait and pay for developing (and getting 1/2 a roll of film worth of blur), if you want a perfect picture, if you want ease of use at a relatively reasonable price... this is the ONLY camera on earth in my book.<br><br>
