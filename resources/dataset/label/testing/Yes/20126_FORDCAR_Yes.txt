            We just traded in our 1995 LX Windstar for a 2000 SEL model.  I *loved* my 1995 Windstar, I drove it longer than my husband wanted me to.  It had lots of storage room, a cool LED display and was very comfortable on short as well as very long (12+ hours) trips.  We had built in carseats which were so handy for our own kids, as well as for friends' kids.
But the 2000 model (we have the one depicted on the website, but with a silver lower part) surpasses it.  It has side power doors on both sides, a built in tv (dealer installed), cd player, cool display with direction and temperature and sensors for backing up (beeps when something is close to the car).
I have to be honest though and say there are some things I like less than my 1995 Windstar.  First and foremost, there is less storage space.  The 1995 model had a drawer under the passenger seat, that's gone now.  We had a bench in the middle, this model only comes with captain's seats (models other than the SEL may still come with the bench though).  The bench provided storage underneath.  There is no storage under the captain's seats.  Then again, the captain's seats are better for kids who are constantly in each other's space.
Driving wise, I love the Windstar.  It handles well, turning radius is very small and mileage is good, important especially with today's gas prices.
It's a pretty looking van, two tone and sleek.  I'd recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
