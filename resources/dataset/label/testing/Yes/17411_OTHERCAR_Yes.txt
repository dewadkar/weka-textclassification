            I bought my 4Runner not only for its reliability but also because it's a Toyota.  Everyone I know that has ever owned a Toyota has been very happy, especially when its a 4Runner.  I however had a problem with the electical system early on, which took 2 different trips to the shop to fix properly.  I love the fact I can carry lots of stuff when I travel, especially my 2 kids.  
But what I don't like about it is that it handles kind of rough on bumpy roads.  I also feel kinda cramp inside, but being 6'5&quot; doesn't help.  I also don't like the lack of horsepower.  I think the Explorer is a better SUV for the money.  But if you want to spend the extra money to own one of the coolest SUV's on the road, then get one.  I feel for the money there are better ones out there.  The 4Runner is not well suited for large families.  I feel is best suits small families and singles.  <br><br>
