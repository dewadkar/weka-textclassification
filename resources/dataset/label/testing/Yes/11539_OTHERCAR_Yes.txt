            I wanted a four-wheel drive vehicle due to the snowy winters and always getting stuck in my driveway.  Therefore, the Jeep Cherokee Sports were having a special on leasing at the time of my looking for a vehicle, and so I went with a white one.  I love the fact that I had absolutely no problems getting out of my uphill driveway when we had several snow storms (with up to a foot of snow).  The only thing I don't really like about my Jeep is the rather rough ride.  The ride is fine on a good road, but living in the north, the winter tears up the roads and as soon as there are rough spots on the road you get bumped around quite a bit.  So if you have neck problems, I wouldn't recommend getting a Jeep Cherokee Sport.  It's fun driving around in it, as long as you're not being given whiplash.  I like riding higher off the ground as opposed to a car.  The only other drawback is for women, if you are wearing a dress it is a bit difficult to modestly get in the Jeep (especially if you're short).  The cargo area is great when going grocery shopping.  Also great for camping, everything fit in the cargo area and you could still see out the back window.   <br><br>
