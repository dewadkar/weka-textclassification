I own a 1990 Plymouth Laser RS.   To those of you who don't know what that is, let me elaborate.    It's a Mitsubishi Eclipse rebadged for Crysler.   Eagle Talon, all in the same.   My car is the two wheel drive version of eclipse, and oh ya, it's turbo charged.   

It's has a 2.0 litre, turbocharged engine making very descent horsepower with 195 at the crack.  That translates to roughly 170 horsepower at the two front wheels.  The motor will push the car, with its 2700lb. curb weight to the 140mph limit on the speedo. 
The acceleration is another big plus with this car.  0-60 times are in the 6.9 sec range, in stock form according to my G-Tech Pro.  My decision to get the two wheel drive version?   You save about 350 pounds of weight from the transfer case, driveshaft, and rear differential of the all wheel drive models.  Plus, there's nothing like smokin' some rubber.

It's a well known fact that these motors respond very well to aftermarket improvement parts.   You only need to take a look in any issue of the import magazines on the shelf and you'll see these 4G63T motors producing 600+ horsepower and running high nines at the drag strip.  The potential in these little four bangers are incredible.    Although the potential is so great, reliability has always been an issue.  (Use quality fluids and change them on a regular basis, and she'll never die on you) Upgrades such as 8.00mm spark pug wires, NGK platinum spark plugs and K&amp;N air filter and 3&quot; exhaust system can greatly increase the power output of the car fairly cheaply.  Manual boost controllers work great on this car, BUT, I wouldn't recommend it unless you've installed a boost gauge and air/fuel ratio monitor.   The O/E mitsubishi turbo charger on the first generation cars are good ones.   They are far superior to the Garret's that come with the second gens.    The stock motor is regulated to 10.5 pounds, but the engine can easily handle 15 pounds of boost.  
The turbo charger can easily force feed 25psi of boost, but I wouldn't recommend exceeding 15 pounds due to stock fuel pump and intercooler capacity restrictions.   The stock turbo's boost comes on strong and smooth.   There is minimal turbo lag on spool up, but they do run out of steam at 6000 rpm.   
  This is the same basic motor for mitsubishi racing program.   All of mitsubishi's rally racing success is due to this motor.   A potential   11 sec. quarter mile runner for under $15,000, you can't beat it.

The seating position and the interior of the vehicle is very intimate.  Everything is within reach.   This is a small car, but it's also a sports car.   It's no worse than a Corvette, a Comaro or Mustang at the time.    The suspension, while can tend to be loose at high speed cornering, provides a very sporty, yet confortable ride.   Rattles and squeeks is  something you'll have to put up with, due to the cheap plastic used throughout the interior.   The door panels can cause the most vibration annoyance if you've got any kind of bass in the trunk.   The seats are comfortable.   I do 5 hour streches of highway driving with the car all the time and it's not that bad.   The lumbar support greatly attributes to the front seat comfort.   The back seat is another story.   It is small, but it works good for groceries.
The trunk isn't bad.   There's enough space for a couple suitcases and bags, with the back seat folded forward of course.

You either love it or you hate it.   I love it.   I love working on the car and I LOVE driving the car.
