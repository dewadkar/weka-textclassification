            So, you're looking for a digital camera, Huh?  We'll if you can afford it,  look no further than Sony's DSC-P1.  It's superior to nearly every other digital camera on the market in EVERY way!

The P1 produces stunning images from 3.34 mega pixels to standard 640x480 in size.  It's design is extremely compact.  Nearly one half the size and weight of Sony's other high end digital camera the DSC-S70, the P-1 packs plenty of features into a pocket sized design.

Like other Sony cameras, the P1 uses Sony's proprietary &quot;Memory Stick&quot; media to store images on the camera.  The P-1 ships with an 8MB memory stick, but 16MB-64MB sticks are available at additional cost (with 128MB and 256MB due in 2001).  The 8MB stick will hold 5 images at highest resolution or up to 118 640x480 images (with various points in between).  Keep in mind before you rush out and buy a bigger memory stick that you can store all you images on your computer or a photo website, so only carry enough memory to get you to the nearest internet connection.

The Sony DSC-P1 has a terrific &quot;InfoLithium&quot; battery which reports back to the camera how much energy is left in it, and while charging, how much longer the recharge will take.  The battery lasts about 90 min. if you leave the LCD screen off (about 70 min. with it on).  I've found the LCD on top of the camera to be a fantastic resource.  It allows you to see the battery life and current image resolution without having to use the image display screen at the rear of the camera.  You may want to invest in an additional battery (Sony's price = $60.00) if you plan on using the camera for extended periods.

Sony's P1 also comes with a 3x manual zoom and 2x digital zoom (amazing for a camera as small as this one), a flash with red eye reduction capabilities, and USB and television connections.  Downloading pictures to your PC is a snap with the included software and cables.

The P1 includes several other advanced features not found on many other cameras.  You can record 5-15 second mpeg movies complete with sound.  Additionally you can create a &quot;clip motion&quot; animation.  This allows users to animate a series of closely spaced still images into a animated short.  The camera also has a speaker built in to allow audio playback of recorded sound.  Very nice.

I've found the menus and controls, intuitive and easy to use. The LCD image display screen is very nice and is visible even in bright sunlight.

In all, the Sony DSC-P1 has the most compact form of any 3.3+ mega pixel camera and plenty of high end features. While currently retailing for just under $800.00, I expect the P1's price will drop off quickly as 5+ mega pixel camera hit the market sometime in 2001. I'm very glad I purchased this camera and would recommend it to anyone currently looking.<br><br>
