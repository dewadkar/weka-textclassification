            An interesting thing happened to me when Kia came to town...

So, I saw from afar, this cute little car..I immediately fell in love with it. It was adorable,(if you can think that about a car) I just had to go and check it out. With my current car (an 86 ford tempo) on its last legs I figured..yeah, I'll be in the market soon.

I was quoted a half decent price for the RS with air etc. $216/mth no $$ down. Hey, thats not too bad. So I eyed this car for a few weeks, I wasn't quite in the market yet, If I'm going to finance a car, I want a good down payment.

But then....
My good ole tempo decided to misbehave one too many times in the course of only 10 days and I got a little fed up with it, so I gave the good folks at Kia a call(They actually came over to pick me up!)I was excited to get to drive the car back to the dealership to work out financing. This is the review of my experience...

We had chosen the blue one, great color! Love it! Pretty good view out through the windshield (I prefer looking down on the road, not up and over the dash) 
Amazingly quiet..then again, my tempo is getting pretty loud. This car was so quiet though that I couldn't hear the engine rpm to know when to shift. There's no arrow telling you when to shift like there is in a cavalier. The radio/cassette stereo was a sony (if memory serves me) and looks really sharp. The tilt steering wheel is absolutely useless. The actual 'wheel' doesn't move, the whole column goes up and down instead. I see no point to that at all. The lumbar support in the drivers seat is awesome. The ride was smooth. I enjoyed driving it...
My biggest problem with it, however, is the leg room up front. I'm only 5'5 and I felt extremely cramped. My knees were up under the steering column. Maybe because I like to keep my knee bent when using the clutch so I sit up closer (I feel I have more control that way) that could just be a personal thing. I imagine a taller person, who puts the seat back more, wouldn't have this problem.
I found myself afraid for my knees if we were to get into an accident since they were actually touching the column.
 
The last thing I had an issue with was size in general, I started thinking, its just too small for a family of four, with prospects of a fifth in the future.

So, in the end I fixed my junker and we're still thinking about what we want to do.
We'll probally end up buying something a little older, with all the options in the world.
