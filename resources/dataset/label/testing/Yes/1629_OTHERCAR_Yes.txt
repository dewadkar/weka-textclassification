            I bought my Prizm in April of 2000.  I love it.  For a commuting car, it has done it's job and done it well.  I have had only maintenance expenses on this vehicle over the last 3 years.

There are a few things I do not like about this car, and they are few.  The seats.  I am a big guy, and with my wide back, the seats seem a little to small.  They get uncomfortable if I have to drive more than an hour.  The radio is horrible.  I have a cassete player in mine, and it broke.  If I play a tape, I cannot hear the music.  All I hear is muffled sounds.  My antennae broke off when I placed a antennae ball on it.  So beware.  Finally, unless you get automatic door locks, you cannot undo the back doors unless you reach around and unlock them.  It is very annoying.

Now the good news.  I get very good gas mileage.  30 miles to the gallon.  It would be better if I drove in a more rural setting.  I do like the way the car drives.  When I bought it new, it felt like I was on rails.  It has a very good pickup for a 4 cylinder.  It has a Toyota engine in it, so it has been very reliable.  Plus the fact that a tune up is not needed until 100,000 miles, sold me.  For a car that drives me to and from work, it does it's job very well.

Finally, the price.  I got a good deal through work, or I would have just bought the Corolla.  The resale value is less than a 2000 Corolla, and that is not good news for those who like to have a new car every two or three years.  This car ran around $15,000 with everything, and I could have gotten a mid-size Malibu for that price.  

I give this car a thumbs up because it starts every time I turn the key, gets good mileage, and never breaks down.  I planned on keeping this car for ten years or so, so I think I am getting my monies worth.
