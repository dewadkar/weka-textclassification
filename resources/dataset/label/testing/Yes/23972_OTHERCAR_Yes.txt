            My dad got a 93 Volkswagen Corrado VR6 (Not G60, which are prone to problems). It was red, it was in good shape, and had about 85,000 miles. My sister and I drove that everywhere, and I loved every second of it.
Everyone who drove in it loved this car. It was so different from all other cars they've seen or been in. They thought it was cool. It was.
The car could go very fast, but I never put it that fast too often anyway. I loved this thing. It handled well, it looked great, it had good acceleration, and it was like no other car. 
Then...
The auto trans went out on my sis at around 110,000 miles. My dad had it in the shop for months and spent thousands to fix it. Next thing you know, the baby's back with a new manual trans. My dad says it drives BETTER know than it did with an auto trans. And he's right. The auto trans are usually very problematic, but the stick's last up to 200,000 usually (if taken care of, of course.)
So, whats great about the car? The little 2.7 liter V6 (and it is small), is durable and powerful. For a 15 degree engine, it gets 170 horses and flies this sub-3000 lb car off the line. Also, being an SLC version (which all after 93 were), it has heated leather seats, a power sunroof that retracts INTO the roof itself, and a self-retracting spoiler that retracts under 20 MPH. And the looks. You've seen the picture: sleek, different, better than a Civic. If they just still made these, I tell you they'd top Civic's in every way.
This is a hard car to find, due to limited production, so it can cost a good amount of money. But I think it's worth it, because this is such a cool car, and I still love it, even though I now own a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon (a great car, even better looking then the VW, but it ain't the same). Just get a stick, and you'll be fine.
