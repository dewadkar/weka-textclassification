                I own a 1999 Cherokee Sport. Before purchasing this vehicle new in Dec '99 
I looked at the competition , ie. Blazer,Explorer,Durango.I wanted an feature loaded vehicle at an affordable price. Upon comparison with the affore mentioned SUV's, I found that the Cherokee provided the features I desired at a much lower price than the competitors. I ordered my Cherokee from the factory with Sport package, upgrade wheels and tires, Trac-loc differential, tint windows, cruise, and % speed tranny. I paid @ $21000. In comparison with the competition, I would have paid $7000 to $8000 MORE for a comparably equipped SUV .Trade-offs when buying the Cherokee were a bit less interior room and more difficulty getting into and out of the back seat. Also configuring for max carrying entails removing the rear seat. Reinstalling the seat can be a bit tough for 1 person(especially in the dark).
    
   The Cherokee has fantastic car-like handling on the highway as well as a very nice ride. When on rough roads, however, the car can be a little too truck-like for some people. Acceleration is very good, getting up to highway speed is a breeze as is passing on the 2-lane. Braking is good with a comfortable feel and effort. Fuel economy is terrific compared to other SUV's. I get 22 mpg highway. 
    
   Off-road capabilities are absolutely awe-inspiring. I attended Camp Jeep last year and experienced the true off-road capabilities first-hand. The ease with which this vehicle can traverse what looked to be impassable terrain is truely impressive. The Jeep has good axle articulation, much better than it's competitors.
    
   All in all, this vehicle is a fantastic buy for not a lot of cash. Mine has 37000 miles without a single problem or rattle. I strongly recommend this car to anyone in the market for a fun, affordable vehicle.<br><br>
