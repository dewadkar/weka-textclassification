              I bought a used 1990 Plymouth Laser RS with the 2.oL four cylinder.  This car is truly amazing.  I have yet to have a mechanical malfunction and the car has nearly 200,000 kms on it, the interior looks like it's brand new, the body is the same way.  I am constantly getting compliments about this car and most believe don't believe their ears when I tell them the car is 10 years old. I'm 6'1&quot; tall and I find the car very comfortable.  The back seat is useless for people but being young and single I have no need for it anyways.  The hatchback is very useful and allows a large amount of cargo to be hauled in conjunction with the folded rear seat.  The ergonomic, wraparound, aircraft like interior styling impresses everyone who gets into the car and gives you the feeling of piloting an aircraft instead of merely driving a car.  As for power, the 2.oL coupled to the 5 speed manual gives for lots of pep in any gear.  In my opinion this is a great car for anyone who doesn't need to haul too many people.  
  I've only done a few oil changes and a wiper blade change as far as maintanence goes.  Gas milage is excellent.  Power is plentiful, but if you really want to go fast get a turbo model, most of the stock awd models can run with Mustang 5.oL, which isn't bad for a 4 cylinder.  Driving this car is a joy, the transmission is a bit crunchy but with a simple shifter modification on www.dsm.org and the right fluid shifting can be buttery smooth.  The small size of the vehicle makes it great in the city and the smooth cruising and sporty demeaner is superb on the highway. 
  I think anyone who is young, enjoys a sporty car and lots of attention, and, if you're a guy, wants to pick up alot of girls should buy this car.  If you're a family person you'll need more room than what the backseat can offer so I'd choose something else.  To anyone interested in this car check out www.dsm.org.  All the information in the world about these cars can be found there, including how to make them faster than such exotics as the Viper.
