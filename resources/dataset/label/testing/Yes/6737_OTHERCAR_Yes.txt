            I have had this car since 8/90. While I regret having sold my 1982 Accord (now Civic-size)because of worn-out back top seats due to the sun, the 1990 Honda Accord is one of the finest cars ever built. 

The 1990 is the first in a new model series.It has a higher theft rate than a lot of other Honda years in the 1990s. I have the EX with sunroof and shield. The shield is a super feature. I also have the the door rain guards. These are a wise addition. I installed a center arm rest which was wise.
I also have tinted windows that meet legal requirements.

Having been in many scrapes, I wondered why the car never flipped. Then I read it has the lowest roll-over rate of any popular model.  Still can't figure out how to properly use the lumbar back support. The "gas left" reader is a bit misleading unless one remembers the tank holds 17.0 gallons.

Now I have 101,800 miles and some minor scratches. But, the car is a dream on the road, corners superbly and has a great sound system. Dozing off while driving on long trips is common because the music and quietness lull a person to sleep. Also, there is no air blowing in noise.

My only annoyance is that the driver's seatbelt keeps getting stuck in the door as I get out. I should try and install a roller. But, the seatbelt has held up, despite being caught in the door at least 3000 times.

As I get in the newer Accord EX models, there are very little new features.  I know eventually my car will wear out. But, for now market value belies actual value and road worthiness. Not being able to lock oneself out with the keys in the ignition is another feature.

The 1990 Accord EX has to be one of the finest vehicles ever built. It is a marvelous magic carpet that goes where the driver wants. Also, when a blow-out occurs, the car keeps its place while others skip lanes.
