            I've had no problems with it. My previous car was a Honda Civic, so I was a little shell-shocked at the difference in gas mileage at first, but that's to be expected.

I've had no complaints. For the price, it's a great little truck - much more affordable than other comparable models. The soft top is easy to replace and remove and it looks great either way.

I've had no problems with mine engine-wise. One problem though - the plastic inside cover for the sunroof immediately fell on my head as I was driving from the lot. Apparently the glue they used melted in the sun and voila! The hooks that fastened it would loosen and the sunroof cover would plunk on your head at a very inopportune moment. Shortly afterward I received a 'recall notice' for this particular part and have had it fixed twice now. Still waiting for the darn thing to fall on me again (so most of the time I keep it off :-)

Other than that - a great truck. I love it.
