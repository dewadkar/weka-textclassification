            This is my first digital camera, and as a graphic designer, I give it two thumbs up!  There is nothing better than taking a picture and immediately viewing it on the screen.  You can take pictures of anything!  This camera is so simple and easy to use.. even if you have never used a digital camera, in no time, you'll be a pro!  

You can instantly keep or delete your pictures.  The camera has a record mode(for taking pictures) and a play mode(for viewing all of your pictures).  The camera holds up to 65 pictures.. that's a good amount if you camera?!

With this camera, you can put pictures on your computer, print them out, use them for the internet and more!  This camera is great because it's formatted for both Mac and PC platforms!

INVEST IN THIS ONE!<br><br>
