            After a bout with a '93 Z28 (VERY FAST) that made me realize that I was no where near mature enough for a sports car, I stayed sane for 9 months in a new Jeep. Well, I needed speed again, and, at over 300lbs, I needed a big car that could quell my need for speed as well as my need for room. The Impala SS was (and is) the trick. I saw one in '94 when they first came out and told my dealer friend that if they ever moved the shifter to the console from the column, I would order one. Order one is exactly what I did. 

I am the owner of a Black '96 Impala SS. From day one it turned heads. Room for five (and room for Golf clubs for all five in the cavernous trunk) tagged to a 260 HP LT-1 (tuned down by restrictive intakes and exhaust) was just the recipe for me. The leather seats are among the most comfortable of any car seat I have been in. The interior, a strong upgrade from standard Chevy fare still suffers from domestic car age issues (Squeaks, rattles, loose bits etc). Luckily, that is my only complaint. This car has been run against 300ZX Twin Turbo's on an 1/8th mile track (No victory, but I was not blown away either!) and cruised from Florida where I got it all the way out here to Washington State. It is happy performing both tasks equally.

I average about 22 MPG in mixed driving and have had very few issues with the car. The rear axles of the B-Body cars (The Caprice group on which this is based. It it the Caprice with the 9C1 Police package and some definite cosmetic adds) had some issues as the gasket they used from the factory did not allow for proper lubrication. If you have a groaning rear-end, this is probably the issue and can be resolved easily with a rear-end lube job. Tires are pricey but fun as they inspire fear in the hearts of other smaller vehicles on the road.

All in all, I still haven't found a car out that I like as much. If you can find one, buy it (unless you are in Washington State as the car has almost APPRECIATED here! Lucky Me!). Buckle up and have fun! You are in the last of a classic breed!<br><br>
