            After car shopping for my wife for the last month or so, researching on the internet, visiting dealers, tracking down lots of used cars that weren't such great deals in person, we finally decided on a new 2001 Lexus GS 300 sedan to replace her awesome but problematic '97 BMW 540i.  I'm not usually an advocate of buying luxury cars new, but one downside of the GS 300's great resale value is that they are hard to buy used at a price low enough to make it a good deal.  Every time a reasonably priced model came up for sale, it was sold before we could even see it.  The only ones that were available were at dealer lots, complete with premium prices, sales tax, and often lots of (not so well) hidden problems.  One even smelled like a dead body inside!

Yes, we know that the Lexus isn't nearly the performance driving machine that the BMW is.  But that's not really what my wife wants in a car.  She is more luxury and reliablity inclined, and the GS 300 delivers that in spades.   I also find the GS 300 to be the current best balance of performance, luxury, comfort, and intangibles for the money.  Here's my thoughts on the various elements of the car:

EXTERIOR:  First of all, I find Lexus paint jobs to be about the best out there.  They seem to still be shining years after the new has worn off.  We selected the Onyx Black.  Yes, it is hard to keep clean, but if you have to be in the driveway washing your car every weekend, at least it's nice to look at when you do.  

The lines of the GS take some getting used to. It is a very unconventional look. It has really grown on me over the years since its re-design for 1998.  Still, it is a love it or hate it design.  I happen to like it.

Fit and finish is second to none.   It just exudes quality.   Pictures don't really do it justice.  I also find that certain colors show off the lines better than others.   White, for example, tends to wash out the slight curves around the bottom of the car near the wheel wells that give it a muscular look.  The metallic silver/gold colors look emasculated to me, and are way too common.  But again, this is a very subjective thing. My favorite addition for 2001 is the new wheel design. The spokes are thinner, and I feel, more aggressive looking than the rounded 16&quot; wheels of previous years.  

INTERIOR:  Wow.  The Lexus interior is my favorite of all makes.  With the exception of a few slightly cheesy knobs and switches that are right out of a Toyota, it says quality from stem to stern.   The Leather is soft and well stiched. We also went with black leather on the interior, even though we live in the south. In the used models we saw, the black interiors all looked brand new, while the lighter colors, especially tan, seemed to show every crack and crevice.  Besides, the black just looks cool.   My wife parks in a garage at work, so hopefully there won't be too many times when she regrets the color choice in the summer.  All the various interior controls are easy to use and intuitive, VERY unlike those in a BMW. There are still buttons in our 540i I am afraid to push.

Seat comfort is perfect for me.  I have broad shoulders and long legs and can't seem to get comfortable in most cars.  The GS 300 actually has more front seat leg room than the flagship LS 400, and is bigger inside in some dimensions than the LS 400.  The arm rest falls just where I want it, the pedal placement feels right, and the power memory telescoping wheel is a big help in finding the right driving position.  I could never get 100% comfortable in our BMW, but I could within seconds in a GS.  

The sound system is the basic model, but it sounds clearer, with much more base than the BMW system.  The 6 disc changer is conveniently located inside the glove box, rather than in the trunk, where you find yourself listening to the same 6 discs for months at a time, because you forgot to change them before you left home.  The controls are also easy to use.  Not audiophile quality, but a nice stock system.

The climate controls are straightforward and easy to use, with dual zone climate control standard.   I've never been big on auto climate control. Hopefully this one will work better than the one in the BMW, which always kept you guessing.  

Visability is excellent, with no bad blind spots, at least compared to the BMW 5 series, which was troublesome  to back up or change lanes with. 

Inside, the Lexus just does whatever you'd want a car to do.  The interior is this car's strongest area, and it's strong in all areas.

PERFORMANCE:  The GS 300, despite the advertising, is not a performance car.  It is, however, a car that handles decently, brakes very well, and has enough power to scoot to 60mph in 7.8 seconds.  There is a good deal of body float compared to the BMW, but there is also a much quieter, smoother ride, and the BMW is no slouch in that category.  The quiet 215mm tires should be replaced with wider ones when worn out, to gain a little more grip in turns.   But for commuting to work, or highway cruising, this is a great handling car.   Lexus makes performance (L-tuned) spring and suspension components for those who want crisper handling.   The inline 6 cylinder engine puts out 225 hp and is very quiet and smooth.  It's somewhat disappointing to know I can't punch the pedal and pass anyone in seconds at 80mph like I could in the 540i, but it has more than enough power for normal use.  Braking is sports car great, with a super ABS system.  They also have a vehicle skid control system that keeps you from losing control in situations where you might without it.  It really works.  Just goose it pulling out into traffic in the rain and you'll see.  

SAFETY:  Besides the VSC system and ABS, there is also standard traction control and the great braking and solid handling to keep you safe.  The 3700 lb curb weight also works in your favor.  My favorite safety improvement is the new side curtain airbags. These will help keep your head protected in a side impact collision.  I live in Atlanta, and see plenty of red light runners, so this makes me feel that I am in the safest vehicle possible.   The GS also gets good marks from the Institute for Highway safety for offset crash performance.   It just misses their &quot;best pick&quot; status, due to the slight probability of a driver's left leg injury in a 40mph crash.  

DEALERS/OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE:  Another Lexus strong suit.   You can't find better dealer treatment than you'd get at Lexus.  The sales experience is easygoing and straightforward(hint: use the phone and internet to deal, and don't just walk on a lot, you'll find them less likely to play games).  The service dept assigns you your own service writer, so you deal with the same person every time.   Loaner cars are available for some repairs/service, especially if you bought your Lexus at that dealership.  It's also nice to know they hire the best, so you usually won't have to bring it back twice for the same repair.  That's assuming they break, which they rarely do. Lexus vehicles are among the most reliable on the road.   

Resale, as I mentioned, has so far been phenomenal on the GS 300.  Average mileage three year-old '98 models are going for about $28,000 here in Atlanta. For a luxury car, not bad.   For comparison, a one-year old Lincoln LS V-8 sells for about the same price, used.   Yes, the Lexus costs about $4000 more new, but stil, you can see it has a much better resale value, which means even though it costs more, it will probably cost less in the long run, in terms of total ownership costs such as maintenance/repairs and depreciation.

I would recommend the GS 300 to those who value safety first, and who prefer luxury over pure performance driving.  This is also a great car for busy people, since you're not at the shop every month getting something fixed.  I would also recommend this car over several cheaper models( Audi A6 2.8, Lincoln LS V-8, Infiniti I-30T) for those who keep cars a long time and understand that a higher initial price will be offset by much better long term reliability (Lincoln, Audi) and resale value (Lincoln, Infiniti).   Do NOT buy a GS 300/400 if you are a sports car enthusiast.  After spending all the money to upgrade it to that kind of handling, you would be better off in a new BMW 530i, even with a few more reliability headaches down the line.   <br><br>
