            To tell you the truth, the only reason I bought this car is because my dad was stuck on Hondas.  Now I absolutely love the car.  I've had a lot of custom work to it.  I've had it since 96 and it has been running beautifully.  Just make sure you get you're oil change and the service for each mileage group.  The car is very comfortable and it still runs very well, as though it was new.  I've had one wreck with it, but that did not change anything.  As for the custom work, my biggest problem has been putting turbo on it. It almost blew the engine.  I just advise you to do a lot of research and be very careful if you are thinking about doing turbo.  Honda and Toyota are the most reliable cars ever, and if you just keep up with regular maintanence, it will last you a lifetime.  This is my second Honda and my parents own two Toyotas.  The Honda Accords are beautiful, comfortable, reliable cars.  You can also do a lot of custom work to them and make them look even better and last even longer.  My boyfriend does a lot of custom work, so you can e-mail him for products of you are in the Triad area of NC.<br><br>
