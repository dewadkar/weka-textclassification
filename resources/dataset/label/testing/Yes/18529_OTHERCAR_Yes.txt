            I recently leased a CTS with the luxury package.  I never thought I could get so excited about a car.  I look forward to any excuse to drive it including supermarket runs and other such mundane trips.  Even in traffic, I enjoy sitting in the extremely comfortable interior and playing with the CTS's technology.

First of all, this is an awesome-looking car.  There has been a lot of controversy about the CTS design.  Reviewers have been making comments about the CTS appearance as a "strong statement" and so on, but few have dared to say it just looks darned good.  I dare say it.  It looks darned good.  Several friends and work mates concur.  Even my wife who preferred our 1999 Catera admits that this car looks good.  However, there are a few people who just don't like it.  I got one comment that it looks more or less like a box.  Anyway, the positive comments about the car's appearance have far outnumbered the negative comments.  I've even gotten thumbs-up from a Benz driver in another lane.

I'm not a sports car enthusiast, and I'm not a race car driver.  I use the car for commuting, errands, and occasional weekend excursions.  I'm a safe and moderate driver, and I couldn't discriminate between a good road racing car and an SUV.  That being said, of all the cars I've ever driven including some luxury cars, I've never driven anything as nice as this.  I've even tried some amateurish brisk maneuvering on curvy roads, and it feels really sweet.  For day-to-day driving, it is comfortable, smooth, and fun to be in.  My only complaint is that the road noise could be a little less.

The CTS provides some neat technology for gadget lovers as well.  Gadgets include a Driver Information Center (DIC) which allows you to scroll through information like how much engine oil or transmission oil life you have left before needing a change, how many estimated miles before you need to refuel, and even your average fuel mileage.  Messages are displayed if you need fuel, an oil change, if any door is ajar, your trunk is not closed tightly or your fuel cap is open or loose.  Instead of telling you when to get oil changes based on mileage, the owner's manual tells you to get an oil change when the DIC tells you to.  The DIC even tells you when to expect possible ice conditions based on outside temperature.

The CTS comes with a year of free On Star Safe and Sound Plan.  For $200 you can get an upgrade so to the  Directions and Connections Plan.  I recommend this upgrade.  You can do cool things like have the On Star advisor detect the location of your car and the direction you are driving via GPS, and then give you turn-by-turn directions to your destination.  This beats any onboard navigation system in my opinion, and may be safer since it is hands free (once you've pressed the On Star button).

Another feature is the ability to store personalization options for 2 drivers. You can set the driver's seat to move backward automatically when you exit the vehicle, and slide back to your driving position when you insert the key.  You can custom program buttons on the steering wheel and on the dash to do what you want them to do.  You can even set the passenger side mirror to move downward when you are in reverse to help you see how close you are to the curb when parking.  Spend some time with the owner's manual to learn how to use these and other high-tech features.

As a driver, safety is an important issue to me.  The CTS comes standard with front, side, and side curtain airbags.  The On Star is also a great safety feature.  It will notify local emergency personnel if your airbags open or if you press On Star's emergency button.  Your vehicle's location is provided via GPS.  Now that's a safety feature!

In summary, I love this car.  It looks good, feels good, has fun gadgets, and has great safety features.  I've only had the car a couple of weeks, so the euphoria hasn't yet worn off.  Perhaps in a few months I'll write another review--perhaps more critical.  Until then, the CTS totally rules!
