            This van is about the most comfortable van I have ever driven.  We have had it just over a year and have put over 25,000 miles on it.  It rides more like a car than a typical van.  It is roomy and the rear seats are almost as comfortable as the front.  Controls are easy to get and operate.  We live in Montana and it handles better than most cars in the snow and ice.  Visibility is excellent with little or no blind spots.  The engine (6 cyl) is very smooth with very good acceleration and no problems going up hills with a full vehicle.  It gets decent gas mileage for a vehicle its size and I have not had to do any work on the engine.  It has over 110,000 miles on it and still runs like new.  All and all I would say that this is one of the top vans on the market.  When it comes time to get another, I will buy another Dodge Grand Caravan.<br><br>
