            I leased my second Subaru Forester this past fall.  I have been impressed with my 1999 and figured what the hey.  The points from my Subaru credit card helped sway the decision too.

Things I like:
The engine is more responsive in the 2002 than the 1999, for whatever reason.
A DECENT radio; the Clarion radio in the 1999 is a joke.  Should have listened to it more before I bought it.
I have never driven a car or SUV that gives you this much "feel" and sense of control.  I was in a nasty snow storm in the mountains of Pennsylvania and watched other 4 wheel drive vehicles get stuck (i.e. Chevy Blazer, Ford F-150) and my Subaru came right through.
An outside temperature gauge; little things mean alot.
Things I dis-like:
Do it yourself maintenance is tough.  Changing the oil is a bear and is messy.  The oil filter seals always want to stick on the car.  Is this because the engine seems to run hot?  Forget about changing the plugs.  I bought my own plugs and paid $80 in labor for them to change them.
No leg-room in the backseat.
The Bridgestone tires have great grip while they last, which isn't very long.  I pushed mine to 42k miles.
The 1999 has a more solid feel to it.
Can they put the WRX engine in this car?  More horsepower would be great although 165 does the job.
Gas mileage is consistent but not as advertised.  I get 24mpg maximum on the highway; 23mpg around town.
