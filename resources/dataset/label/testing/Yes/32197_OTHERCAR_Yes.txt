            I have just turned 16 years old.  My mom's vehicle is a 1999 Chevy Cavalier so, that is what I drive most of the time.  As a 16 year old I have put this car to the limits.  The car itself is good.  I like the compact size of the outside but it is big enough on the inside to fit 4 people other than the driver.  The Miles Per Gallon (MPG) is decent for a car with an automatic transmission.  The brakes are very excellent (trust me I know.)  I don't know if this was with all cars but I would recommend that you get the cruise control option.   The car is also safe.  I know that this is an important option for a &quot;family&quot; car.  It is also affordable for the average person.  I suggest buying this car but make sure that it is full of options.<br><br>
