            I purchased this Jeep back in August 2001 and have enjoyed owning it ever since.  I've owned a Grand Cherokee before (1996) and this Liberty is MUCH better in all respects.  I realize that the Liberty replaces the Cherokee, but the rack and pinion steering and independent front suspension do wonders for this Jeep.  In the future, I expect the Grand Cherokee will probably switch to R&P steering as well as some type of independent front or rear suspension.  

On the open road the Liberty feels like a tall sedan and not your typical SUV.  The interior remains relatively quiet unless you go above 75 and then the unfavorable aerodynamics make for a little bit of wind noise. Handling is very good for an SUV.  

Some other reviewers have complained about the acceleration.  I find the acceleration to be adequate.  After accumulating 5,600 miles, the engine has loosened up and the Jeep pulls smartly away from lights.  The driving position is excellent and affords you a good view of the road ahead.   Overall, it's actually a fun vehicle to drive.

I've taken the Jeep off road and it's abilities astound me. The body is as tight as a drum and the suspension travel allows for smooth riding over moderately bumpy dirt roads.

If you're in the market for an SUV and like the feeling of a solid well made vehicle, look no further.  If gas mileage is a concern, you may get turned off.  I've averaged 17 mpg and 70% of my driving is highway averaging 70 MPH. If you are light on the throttle you can probably average 18.5 mpg or so.  

Other vehicles to consider would be the Land Rover Freelander, Ford Escape or the Nissan Xterra.  Take the Jeep for a test drive.  You'll be in for a nice surprise.

***UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2003****
My Jeep is still going strong and has 23,000 miles accumulated to date. I still continue to be amazed by how well this vehicle is constructed. No squeaks, no rattles and that is AFTER driving over what I consider the worst roads this country has to offer (NYC).
