            I purchased a focus wagon with all options, ztec engine and all
knew it was car of year in europe, have driven 500 miles and find the handling great, the ztec engine powerful and it handles bumps as if you are in a big car .  
the size of the car , being over a foot shorter than a honda accord or a toyota camry was a key factor in buying. The interior space is almost the same. 
the car is very quiet except at over 60 miles per hour there is a mild wind noise. 
The car is extremely roomy and the wagon has great storage in the back
it looks fancy much more than the price and i have people who ask me about it all the time.
The only option I wanted to get that you can not get on wagon is leather seats. hopefully next year this will be an option.
the car is good for anyone, it is great if you can you use up your ford visa credits. i got over 2000 off on the ford visa credits. <br><br>
