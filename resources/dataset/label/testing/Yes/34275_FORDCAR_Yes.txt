            My father's 1998 Ford F-150 is just another in the long list of Ford's he's owned. Dating back to 1969, every new vehicle he's purchased has been from the Ford family!

The 1998 F-150 is a middle-of-the-road vehicle. Not 4WD, and not an extended cab; it DOES sport an 8 foot bed and he did opt for power windows (for the FIRST time...) and tilt, cruise, and the AM-FM Cassette Stereo. 

I've driven the pickup on several occasions; one of the advantages of living relatively close and not owning my own truck... and it's everything you would expect from a Ford (IF you expect good things, that is!)

The vehicle handles solidly, stops efficiently, and is surprisingly comfortable for a long ride. (It's got cloth seats with a manual lumbar control.)

It's not been put to the test like some equipment might be, but it's proven strong and durable enough to handle the basic duties of life... if that's what you really want in your truck, this one's for you. <br><br>
