            I thought about not writing this review at all, because I couldn't imagine anyone buying a car that is 10 years old. 
But then I reconsidered, if I buy one,there have to be more people like me out there. 

Since our truck is fairly new, we did not want to be saddled with a second car payment. It was time to get a "new" car and so we bought the 1993 Olds 88 about three month ago. 

The car we bought had only one previous owner and only 50.000 miles on it. I plan on driving it for about three years and then trade it in for a "newer" one. 

Visuals: The Olds looks and is fairly large. The trunk looks a little small until you open it and see that it extends all the way to the backseats. It easily holds a weeks worth of groceries for a large family and all the tools, the kids sports equipment and odds and ends. On our last vacation we were able to fit in two large and two small suitcases plus assorted carry-on bags (3) and supplies for the dogs. 

The styling is not very exciting though. There's nothing very sporty about it and it's probably not a car that will be first on a young persons list. My son named it the "Mom car" and I think that describes it pretty adequately. 

Engine: I don't know if it comes in any other configuration, but mine is a 6-cylinder. The power you get out of this car is pretty amazing. Just step on the gas and see what it can do. Gets you some weird looks from the guys in their big trucks when you pass them effortlessly. 

We get about 20 - 24 miles a gallon, so it's not exactly a gas hog. On the other hand cars that might not have been taken care off as excellent as the one we bought might get a little less mileage. 

Interior:
Again, nothing really exciting there. The controls are easily configured on the dashboard. When you first start the car all the checklights come on like they should (this goes away after a second or so). In the car I have, the warning light for the seat/safety restraint stays on for quite a while. I'm not sure if that is just our car, or standard for the Olds 88. It does go off after a minute. 

This car comes with a passenger side airbag only. Front and back seats have shoulder belts, the middle seat in the back has a lapbelt only. The frontseats are comfortably sized even for a large adult (my husband is over 6 feet - he has no problem getting in or out). The backseat is spacious enough for two tall adults and a child, or for three children. It will not accomodate three adults without them feeling a bit cramped. 

The middle console opens to store all those litte things like change and all the other junk that accumulates. Integrated in the console is an adjustable cupholder (two cups). 

The backseat area has one cupholder (in the back of the console) and a separate airvent. This is great because my kids stopped complaining that it is too hot/too cold back there. 

The front seats also feature adjustable headrests, the backseat does not have a headrest, but goes up fairly high. 

The only complaint I have is about the steering wheel. If you tilt it a certain way (I am 5'7") I cannot see what gear I am in. The gear indicator is way on the bottom of the controlpanel. But that's something you get easily used to. 

The driving noise (even at high speeds) is acceptable. There is some noise while driving, but virtually none while being in "park" or when driving at low speeds. 

Maintenance: The car we bought was extremely well maintained. The original owner had always done oilchanges and other maintenance on time. We really haven't had a problem with anything yet. So far we have put another 15.000 miles on the car and not seen a problem. 

Repairs: We have not had any major repairs yet, so I can't comment on this. I will update this if needed. 

Overall: I will gladly recommend this car to anyone. I am extremely happy with the handling and performance. The gas/mileage ratio is acceptable and the comfortlevel is very good.
