            I received this camera from my family for a birthday present almost a year ago.  The convenience of it's high storage capasity is great, and I love the lack of need for film!  Plus, no high developing costs!  This camera has all features I could request.   Controls are very easy to figure out and use.  Dial setting switch in back is particularly useful.   I wish I could delete pictures with out so much button-pressing, however.  Also, notice the resolution dial is on the bottom of the camera--took me a while to find it!!     Adobe photoshop software that is included is great, except that to complete projects or use sample clip art you have to load the cd back into the computer.  
Tips:  
-Don't use the zoom button.  simply take the picture and zoom in on it and crop after you upload it to your computer--this achieves higher quality.
-Buy an extra set of high quality, long lasting rechargable batteries--charge one set while you are using the other.  don't waste your money on alkali batteries, because you will be spending a lot<br><br>
