            Before your read my epinion, read &quot;jrks&quot; as she has had more experience with her &quot;truckie-poo&quot; than I have with Tarantula.

Dodge has certainly undergone an enormous (and positive), metamorphosis with the new line of Ram trucks introduced seven years ago.  We bought our 4X4 Off-Road Ram 1500 just a month ago and it has only 500 miles on it to date.  That is not much mileage to comment on service and reliability, but I can speak to its size, power and comfort.  This truck is large and strong.  Its 5.9 liter engine is more than adequate with excellent acceleration.  It is also thirsty, very thirsty.  The only truck I owned that ate more fuel was a 1998 Ford 350 with a V-10.  We are getting about 10 mpg around town, maybe 15 on the highway.  Although the truck came equipped with everything but leather, I did just order the optional trip computer and will have it installed next week.  Maybe it will help me maximize fuel economy.

The Dodge sport has incredible ground clearance and that means a tall step to get in.  The interior is more comfortable, roomier and better laid out than any of the competition.  Instruments are easy to read, seating exceptionally good, and it truly in its quad cab configuration can accommodate 6 people.  With its 17&quot; off-road tires, the Ram 1500 still gives a good ride and surprisingly low noise.  My wife loves her sports car, but is equally willing and eager to drive the truck.

I have pretty much gone over this truck and checked everything from the smallest detail to the things that really count.  Everything was flawless, perfect paint, perfect alignment, smooth engine, and great interior.  I am picky.  The only thing I found was a low coolant level at delivery.  I do find that the gear shift into low range is stubborn, there is no hesitation or &quot;grunting,&quot; it is just not push button easy.

This is not an inexpensive vehicle with a sticker price of $34,000; about the same as Ford and GM for similar models.  So why did we choose it?  We owned nothing but Ford and GM products until 1992 when I bought a Dodge van, in 1999 I bought a Chrysler Sebring convertible.  Both cars have been absolutely the best I have ever owned.  In 94,000 miles, the Caravan still had her original everything except tires.  We hope that the new Dodge truck will perform as well.

In summary, this truck is strong, quiet, roomy, very well equipped from the factory, and backed by an excellent service policy.<br><br>
