            Back in the fall of '99, my significant other and I were shopping for a vehicle. We listed our needs (carry us, carry stuff, carry us) and started with mid-size sedans. We went up in size from there. 

For months, we tested every sedan we could get our hands on, drooled over every coupe we could lay our eyes on, imagined 4x4ing in every SUV we drove by, and read every article we could dig up. By the end of it, we were considering just buying bicycles and fixing our current vehicle. But seriously, as we looked more and more, the choice became obvious.

I work for a construction company, and had a regular cab assigned to me from the fleet. It was a '99 Silverado. Now, I'm not too keen on the styling of the Silverado. It seems a little plain to me when compared with Ford and Dodge. Not to mention there are Silverados everywhere! Stop at a red light, and there's a Silverado! Flying down the highway... wow! look! A Silverado! But as we drove around in the fleet truck, it began to grow on me. A small thought formed in the back of my mind, around the time I was having fun jumping curves to beat other people out of the parking lot, and enjoying the muffled silence of the truck, as well as the high-set visibility and gigantic mirrors..... Why don't we get one?

Instead of going with the wildly popular Chev, we went to look at the Sierra. Now, having read hundreds of articles in countless magazines, I knew that GM was trying to separate their product line from Chev's a bit. GMC would cater to the slightly &quot;upscale&quot; crowd, while Chev would remain pumping out solid workhorses. I believe that the Sierra's styling is quite aggressive, while being able to blend into the crowd. I can't count how often somebody's going to cut me off, of block me from merging, but they see this big blue beast coming at them and get out of the way!

Starting with a base model 2wd, we began to shape our truck. Eventually, we decided to stay away from the expensive Z71 chassis and suspension, as our $40000 investment would probably not see extreme rock &amp; bush until way later in it's career. Also, the Z71 tester we drove had a very bad habit of the rear end &quot;skipping&quot; over expansion joints in the freeways. Plus, it costs more. So, with a &quot;street truck&quot; in mind, we settled on a Sierra SLE 4x4 with the Automatic 4-wheel drive system. Now, what this system does, is take the bulky shifter from the floor, and place it on the console beside the wheel in an array of pushbuttons. Included in this feature, is a &quot;Auto&quot; mode, which engages the front transfer case, but does not engage the axle until the system detects rear tire slippage. We were able to test a 4x4 on both dry and wet surfaces. What a difference! Regardless of what engine you choose, the rear wheels are a little spin-happy, but the &quot;Auto&quot; mode keeps wheel spin to a minimum.

Speaking of engines... which to choose? Since we do not own anything over 100lbs, we opted to stick with the standard 4800 Vortec V8, instead of the more powerful 5300. But our 4.8-liter engine is no slouch. Lots of highway passing power is constantly on tap. Thump the gas at the green light, and the Sierra will push you back into your seat, as the guy who was revving his domestic V6 coupe beside you is left reading the expiration date on your rear plate. Third-party engine modifications can turn this hauler into a true street-sleeper, with enough power and torque to keep up with a Corvette!

The Sierra is a quiet truck inside at highway speeds, even more so than some of the upscale coupes in the same price range. Interior fit and finish isn't as high as, say, Lexus quality (remember, big, dirty construction guys buy these trucks too), but is surprisingly clutter-free. The gauges are among the most simple and efficiently laid-out on the planet, and a neat little &quot;message center&quot; LED display gives you instant warnings on everything from low fuel to indicating the cargo light is on. 

The SLT trim level gives you leather and a nifty little center console that locks, but the armrests on the captain's chairs are a little too low, and the console is even lower. We chose the SLE trim, with the 40/20/40-split bench option instead. The bench has a flip-down console with a built-in clipboard, and is the perfect height for your arm to rest upon! Even though we lost the powered seats option with the leather, you still get lumbar adjustment for both driver and passenger. 
The factory CD player is the best I have ever heard from a factory device, with a six-speaker system delivering lots of clear sound with tons of bass-whoomp. And open the standard third door, and voila! Real rear seats! We did a little test. We managed to get a Silverado and a Malibu side by side at one dealer. We sat in the back of the Malibu. We sat in the back of the Chev. We sat in the back of the Malibu. Although the Chev's seat was a little more upright, legroom and hiproom were almost comparable! 

Huge side mirrors, powered as part of our SLE trim, give you a clear view all around the truck. When I drive my company car now ('99 Malibu), I have difficulty adjusting to the tiny little mirrors that show you very small spots on the road behind you. The Sierra has an automatic headlight control system, that uses a sensor on the dash to &quot;sense&quot; what the light level is outside the truck, and if it's dark enough, the light's come on all by themselves! The power locks automatically lock you in once the truck is moving beyond 20kph, however they do not unlock once you stop and turn the truck off. However, it's funny to watch your clueless passengers yank on the doorhandles trying to get out. 

Overall, we are now at 20,000 kms, and are still very impressed with the Sierra. None of the other problems cited by some other Sierra owners (rattling rear windows, rattling dash, squeaky power windows, and chrome coming unglued) have surfaced so far. Well, except for one. The floor covering for the rear driver-side passenger heat duct caught on the chassis of the driver's seat and unglued itself. Despite a few trips to various dealers, the problem remains unsolvable due to the fact that the airbag module is sitting directly underneath it. Other than that, the truck is as glorious as the day we drove it out of the showroom. A few rock chips have accumulated on the hood, and the windshield had to be replaced because of a crack cause by a rockchip. No other work has been required. The only gripe with this truck is parking the beast in tiny spots, but we always hog two spots at the far end of the lot... walking be damned! The truck continues to deliver a solid performance, backed up by a powerful punch. 

The Sierra is one of the best designed-and-executed trucks I have seen and driven (with several Dodges and many Fords intermixed in our fleet, trust me, I know). With the addition of the optional fourth-door for 2000, this truck takes it's place as not only a segment leader, but a model of excellence for the truck market. If you need a vehicle that can not only haul you and five others around in comfort but carry stuff too, than this truck is an obvious choice.
