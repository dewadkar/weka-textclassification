            Everyone has a dream car when they grow up.  A certain model that they tell themselves, "One day when I can afford it, that will be my car."  Well, for me that car was a classic mustang.  I achieved that dream when I purchased my 1966 Ford Mustang.  I still own the car today, but have found that I like to work on the car too much for it to be my permanent daily driver.  So I took myself on out to a place that I dread... the Chevy dealership.  Classic salesman pressure.  Then I found out how much they are selling the camaro for these days.  Well, believe me, there was no chance I was spending $30,000 on a car.  I of course didn't want to tell the salesman that, so we went for a test drive.  It was nice, good speed, but man, way to much for a car.

Then my journey took me back home to the paper.  I saw the advertisements for the Ford dealerships giving great deals on mustangs, so the next morning, it was down to the Ford shop.  I looked around at some very nice mustangs, and even saw a beautiful Shelby Series 1.  I found a red mustang convertible that I just drooled over when I first saw it.  The salesman noticed that and went to get the keys.  We test drove the car.  It had more power than what I expected to be coming from V-6 car.  I wanted to go with the high powered V-8, but when the dealership offered to knock off $2000 and buy out my lease, I couldn't really turn down the car that I loved the sight of.  We went and filled out the paperwork, and after it all, the mustang cost me $14,000 and had less than 20,000 miles on it.

ENGINE

The V-6 in this mustang is more than the average V-6.  It puts out just under 200 HP, but the acceleration is absolutely amazing.  Just stomp on the gas, and you will be on your way in style.  While on the engine, I will discuss the gas mileage.  It gets around 25 MPG, which for those of you driving little cramped compacts may seem small, but for those of us like me, who drive power cars, think that 25MPG is a lot better than the 7 that my 66 mustang gets.

COMFORT

The beautiful pony interior is more than just great to look at.  It feels great to sit in, relax in, and just basically it is one of the most comfortable ride I have ever had.  The back seat is a little cramped, but not as bad as it used to be on the Mustang.  There is a surprisingly large trunk in this car which makes long driving trips more fun.

STEREO

I had no idea Ford was putting out a factory system like this.  The Mach system in this car is better than most professional system I hear that people spend $1500 on.  The whole car is engulfed by the sound from the speaker, and you get a true experience.

HANDLING

This car grips the road and doesn't let go.  I went driving down some of the winding roads of the Carolina countryside, and was amazed at how well the car performed at the speeds I was at.  I was never at all tempted to slow down for a steep turn, or anything, I completely trusted the car.  Now, the suspension is a sports car suspension, that means you will feel a few bumps, but they just make the ride more fun, makes you feel like you've been driving not riding in a video game.

OVERALL

One of the best cars out there for under $15000.  Whatever you like in a car, this one probably has.  I am constantly impressed by both the car and the good Ford people who call monthly to check in.  I couldn't have asked for more.  So  go get those keys and we'll drive out.  Enjoy the road.
