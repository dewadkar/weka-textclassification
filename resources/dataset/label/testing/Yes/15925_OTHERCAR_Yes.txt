            I bought a 03 Cavalier brand new off the lot.  I choose a Black on black 2-door coupe, with the following options:

Standard 5-speed (by choice, i like the stick)

6-Speaker Premium sound system, with subs, an amp, XM reciever, CD and cassette.

Power package, keyless entry and alarm.

Convieniance package: floormats, mudd guards, ect.

I went to buy this car mainly because of the $5000 in rebates, (4k rebate, 1k loyalty) The cars sticker MSRP was 15,800, and i paid, after bartering and the rebates around 10k.  The car is very sporty, especially the coupe. The 140hp Ecotec engine packed with a 5-speed really is quick. 0-60 in around 7.5 sec, which is pretty excellent in its class.  The engine is very quite, and road noise is to a minimum. Next to it being fast for what it is, the braking is quite good also, ABS is no longer standard, but most models have it. If safety is a big issue, side airbags are also an option, next to the standard driver and passenger front air bags. Handling was also quite good, despite the fact that i didnt get the sport suspension package, and the wider tires, I still did not feel as though i was being pulled to the side, on sharp sharp turns.

Upon getting into the vehicle, I noticed that the interior didnt seem or feel cheap at all, it didnt really look like any shortcuts were taken in putting the interior together. It all seemed solid. My last car was a 93 corolla, which had a very, very cheap interior.  The inside of the cavalier is very sporty, my inside is charcoal, or black in color, and i think appearance wise the inside is very attractive.  I was suprised that the front seats, for such a small car, were actually quite wide, and had good lower back support. I never feel cramped or uncomfortable. An extra inch of headroom would be nice, so i dont have to slant the seat back and reach for the wheel, but then again, i am 6'1".  THe sound sytstem is great, my model came with the best sound system which included 4 speakers, 2 subs, built in amp, XM satalite tuner (all hardware included and installed) CD, and cassette.  The subs perform great, and the deck is very nice, with lots of customizable sound settings. Problablly the best sound system you can get in the compact car class.  Very nice option to add. 

In short, I step back and take a look at the black on black coupe, with all the options listed and the fast 2.2 140hp ecotec engine, and i feel that i got an excellent deal for around 10k, after rebates.  Thats hard to beat.  If your looking for a new compact car, make sure you don't pass this one by, especially with the deals GM has going on right now.
