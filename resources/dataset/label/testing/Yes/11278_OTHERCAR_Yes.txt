            Click and Clack, Edmunds, and Consumer Report all give the Forester high marks and now I know why.  I've had mine for 3 months now and just love it.  It handles great, offers a smooth ride, and holds plenty in back, and has many extra small storage nooks.  I'm also pleased that we can get two kayaks on the roof.  I wouldn't mind a bit more leg room in the back though.  My six foot two husband feels a bit cramped whenever he relinquishes the front seat to guests.  If you are looking for a safe, comfortable, small SUV with decent gas mileage, this may be the vehicle for you.<br><br>
