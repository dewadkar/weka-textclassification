            My wife happened to see a picture of the new Chevrolet Impala in a magazine she was reading at the doctors office and fell in love with the picture of the Impala and said that she loved the style and that she wanted that car! Well we went to a Chevrolet dealer but they didn't have any in stock at the time. Asked the salesman to call us when they got one in which he did. In the latter part of Sep the dealer got a new Impala in and it was a bright red color. Well, we went down and looked at the car but it wasn't the style that we wanted. About a week later they finally got a fully loaded Impala LS and we took it for a test drive of about 3 miles. My wife loved it and I loved it. The handling and ride were outstanding but it didn't have all the equipment in it that we wanted and wasn't the right color. We decided to order our Impala the way that we wanted it. We ordered the Dark Carmine red color with grey interior and automatic bucket seats and the drivers overhead console. Well, by the time we got done we couldn't get the electric seats unless we got them in leather, so we got the leather and we couldn't get the drivers overhead console without the radio controls on the steering wheel. I didn't like that for safety reasons but we ended up getting it that way. Boiling it all down we got the car that we wanted in the color that we wanted with the equipment we wanted and a lot of extras that we didn't want but now love. We waited about 10 weeks before our car was delivered and we were back and forth with the dealer over when it was coming in. As it was, when it did come in the dealer didn't notify us until the next day. The 2000 Chevrolet Impala is a dream to drive. The handling is excellent and the ride is very smooth. The leg and body room is also very good and we just think this car is fantastic and just as comfortable as the Crown Victoria that we had been driving. I would recommend it to anyone. It is the greatest. The only problems that we have had with it is with the dealer whom we bought it from as to ordering it and getting it delivered but I'm sure they are not all like that. Buy one!<br><br>
