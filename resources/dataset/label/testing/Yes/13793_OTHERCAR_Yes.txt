            I acquired my 1987 New Yorker to drive back and forth to school. It was a car that I didn't have to constantly worry about getting stolen or door dinged. I purchased it for a little over $2000 and for the two years I owned it; I put in a total of $1000 (new rack & pinion, brakes, muffler, upgraded stereo). 

Vehicle Description: 

My 87 New Yorker was a base model. It had an unusual set of packages. In 87, Chrysler offered the Luxury Package which included almost every option on the car. The original owner of my New Yorker took the piece by piece view on option. My car had the following options: 2.2 Turbo engine($678), Deluxe Convenience Pkg - Cruise Control, Tilt Steering Column ($304), Rear Defroster Pkg - Rear Defogger, 500-amp Battery ($192), Auto. Temp. Control Air Conditioning ($925), Power Door Locks ($195), and Wire Wheel Covers ($176). When added up, this comes very close to the price of the Luxury Package (add Leather, power antenna and upgraded stereo along with the options above). 

Driving Impressions 

My New Yorker was powered by Chrysler's 2.2 Turbo engine. It's the same engine used in the Daytona and LeBaron. The 2.2 Turbo puts out 146hp @ 5200 RPM and 176 lbs/ft of Torque @ 3600 RPM. My 0-60 run averaged 10.9 seconds. The 2.2 is torquey enough to get you moving at a good pace from a stop, however, it requires 2 to 3 seconds for turbo boost to build and propel the car forward at a brisk pace. The boost comes on strong and is rather abrupt. You can manage to chirp the tires on wet pavement during full boost. Although the 4-cylinder is rather loud for a luxury car, it isn't much louder than the 2.3 4 cylinder in a 98-01 Accord. It only makes a racket during hard acceleration. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the fuel economy of this car. Chrysler recommends premium fuel and there is a noticeable performance drop if you don't use premium. I averaged 24 mpg in a mix of 70/30 Highway/City driving. Chrysler list fuel economy as 19 city and 24 highway. I rarely got below 20 mpg. 

Handling was a mixed bag. The car could take corners reasonably well, however large road imperfections were transmitted into the cabin with a loud thud. The suspension was much firmer then you'd expect from a luxury car. Wet weather performance was not as good as I'd expect from a front wheel drive car. The main handicap was the P185/75R14 tires that came with the car. They are narrow and tall. This did not help handling in wet weather. 

Brakes were good. As with most cars of the 1980's, this one did not have ABS. In 1988, with the redesign of the New Yorker, Chrysler made ABS and option. I was one year too early to get it. ABS would have dramatically improved braking performance. During panic stops, the brakes were strong but tended to lock up in the rear. 

This car was equipped with Chrysler's 3 speed automatic transmission. While antiquated by today&#146s standards, this automatic shifted smoothly and always at the right time. The downside is that with only 3 gears, the engine ran at a higher RPM during highway driving. This made the engine sound louder than it needed to be on long trips. 

Interior 

The first thing you notice when you sit in the driver&#146s seat is how comfortable and soft the front seats are. They have a pillow design that really makes you feel as if you're in you're favorite living room chair. The next thing you notice is the neat digital dash that springs to life when you insert the key. The dash has bar graph type readouts for: fuel, oil pressure, battery power, and engine temperature. The speedometer is shown by large digital numbers. It is truly the easiest way to decipher information at a glance. The only disadvantage to the electronic instrument cluster is that it tended to fade out in bight sunlight. 

Another thing the driver will notice as he/she starts to look around is the cheap looking plastic wood slathered all over the place. The fake wood definitely looks budget grade and out of place in this type of car. 

Chrysler claims this car to be a six seater. However, even though this is an extended K-car, the back seat is best left to two. The rear leg room is not impressive and I had to move my seat up (I'm 5'10) to give my rear seat passengers more room. This car may look big on the outside but it's rather small on the inside. 

Exterior 

My car was a dark royal blue. It was a great color combo. The car had no rust and the landau top was in great condition. The car looks classy on the outside and I had my share of compliments from people who liked the looks of the car. Even the wire wheel covers were real metal. Chrysler really did a good job making the outside of this large K-car look much more expensive then it really was. 

Mechanical 

The car held up pretty well. I had no trouble with the engine or transmission. Things you need to look out for are rust on the undercarriage (if you live in a snow state), the a/c is notorious on these cars for leaking and mine was no exception. The window motors were also known to fail although all four of mine worked. 

Overall 

This was an excellent car to get me back and forth to school. It never left me stranded and was cheap to buy and maintain. I never had trouble getting parts when I needed them and its performance was not too far off today&#146s standards.
