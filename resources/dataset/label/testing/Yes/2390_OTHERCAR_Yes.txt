            I have owned this camera for a month now and I continue to grow more and more fond of it. I have learned a lot of little tricks and techniques to compensate for a couple of shortcomings the camera has and you will too after using it enough.
       For one thing, the flash on this camera is good for only about 9 feet on the average. The good thing is that the flash fires on a single pulse on this camera and not on a second pulse as a lot of the other digital cameras do. What this means is that you can use a separate flash with a slave sensor on it and it will work perfectly with this camera and give you a whole lot more latitude and a great deal of more distance. This is great as there is no flash shoe connector or auxiliary flash sync. cable connector. Hopefully they will correct this shortcoming on future models.
       You will also notice that about 25% of the view is lost while looking through the viewfinder instead of the LCD. I have found that as long as you keep the image centered from left to right and make sure that you get a lot of your subject towards the top of the viewfinder, such as a head almost touching the top of your view, the picture will come out more to your satisfaction. Again, practice makes perfect. Just a little familiarization with some of these things and you soon will be taking great pictures through the viewfinder as well as the LCD, especially when in bright sunlight when the LCD is harder to see, a trait inherent with all digital LCD cameras I've tried.
       Definitely download the upgrade for the firmware to increase low light ability from the Toshiba website. I did so and the improvement is much noticed. Especially viewing images on the LCD in lower light conditions and the cameras electronics seem to focus better also in low light.
        Most of you know the specs to this camera already as you have heard them countless times so I won't repeat all the same stuff over. You already know that it is loaded with a lot of good stuff and comes with a good software package and the USB download capability is a definite plus.
         So all I can say further is, buy this camera and you definitely won't be disappointed. Half the fun is learning how to use it and the other half is viewing the very pleasurable results and sharing with friends and family. Now the only thing I am waiting on is some auxiliary lenses to be introduced for this camera for telephoto extension, more wide angle, and closer macro capability, and you will have a most awsome camera. Enjoy.<br><br>
