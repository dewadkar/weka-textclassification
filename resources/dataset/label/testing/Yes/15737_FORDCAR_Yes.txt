            The 1995 Ford Windstar is a vehicle built for many different types of people.  Short.....young.......old....you name it, it's for you. The front seats sit up high enough for shorter people to see out of.  My mother is only about 5'2'' and she can see out of it great!!  For older people it is a great vehicle because it is so easy to handle.  Very easy to turn and maneuver.  For the younger driver it especially nice because it has a powerful 3.8 liter engine.  And for the family trips you won't have to hear the kids complaining of cramped legs because this minivan is quite spacious.  Very good van and if you are in the market for a used but good minivan...look hard at the Windstar.<br><br>
