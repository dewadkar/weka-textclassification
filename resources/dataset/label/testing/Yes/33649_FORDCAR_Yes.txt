            I bought the '98 Ford Escort ZX2 in March of 1997.  It was to be used basically as a car for a 90 mile round-trip commute every day.  It did not have cruise or power windows (which is the only thing I would change about the car).  It is very comfortable to drive.  I now have a job where I drive this car an average of 2,500 miles a month.  So, it is practically an office for me.  While this car is sub-compact, I still feel confident of the safety.  The gas mileage is great (and it presently has over 86,000 miles on it).

I have only had a couple of mechanical problems. Around 46,000 miles I had to have the thermostat replaced and at approximately 58,000 miles, the front left wheel bearing.  While these were not very large repair bills (wheel bearing approximately $176), I was surprised of having that problem.

My belief is this car should not be purchased by anyone using it for family purposes.  While I am in my mid-forties - (while the average age suggested buyer is 32) - I would suggest this car for no more than two people traveling.  But, I do suggest this car for dependable, reliable service - and also the reputation of Ford dealers in the way they handle customer service issues.
