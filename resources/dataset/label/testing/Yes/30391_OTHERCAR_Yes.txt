            What a wonderfully driving auto. The vehicle handles and  maneuvers quite well.  It has some very practical features on inside like cargo area stereo controls so that you can have a true tailgate party. It also has a head up display that projects speed and radio station on the windshield so that when coupled with the steering wheel radio controls you can keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel. For the first time in any of my vehicles it has true kid locks on the windows ... it prevents only second row from being operated...passenger may still lower or raise window.

OnStar is also a standard on my vehicle.  And just like Batman, it is there whenever you need it.  (I bought the premium pack and have really used it for tickets and general queries.)

I have had no quality issues .. this vehicle seems very well built.

The obvious challenge for the vehicle is its appearance ...but  you knew that going in.  If you can tolerate the looks I think you've got a winner!
