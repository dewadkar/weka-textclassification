            I don't own this car but my best friend does.  She bought this car because we are in the Army going through AIT (Advanced Individual Training), and we were tired of taking the shuttle everywhere on the weekends and we couldn't go out during the week because we had to call a cab and lets just say they aren't cheap.  

So we were able to test drive the car and she got the loan approved and she took it home the next week.  The car is awesome.  It gets great gas mileage and with the gas prices lately that is a good thing.  The car only cost her $8000, I think that is outstanding for the year I think.

It is a white car with black interior and it has a red and black stripe going down both sides of it.  It hold four people and the trunk space is desent size.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is just starting out or that has a small family maybe one kid or two.
