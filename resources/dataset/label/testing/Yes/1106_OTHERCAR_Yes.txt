            I was in the market for a good 6 to 8 passenger vehicle. I looked at mini vans, and suv's new and used. I test drove many vehicles with many factors in mind. safety, mileage, performance, reliability, style and comfort. Sound like mission impossible? I thought so too.

When all was considered and the test drives were over I settled on a used 1994 GMC Suburban K1500 (4WD)with a 350cid engine. As a stock vehicle it is fine but if you plan to do anything other than drive the kids to school or pick up groceries you will have to make some modifications. This vehicle is solid, and strong and that was a very favorable factor in my decision to purchase. I believe my family and I could survive a fairly severe accident in this vehicle. I did not get that feeling from the mini vans and several smaller suv's. The Suburban handles pretty well but it's a real pain to park. Parking lots in San Francisco charge outrageous prices to park this sub. The mileage isn't great but the 40 gallon tank gives you the range to find decent gas prices and minimize fuel stops on long trips.

You must understand you are basically driving a full sized truck so you sit high enough to see very clearly. This view of traffic will spoil you if you also own and drive a small compact import like I do. I find myself choosing the Suburban for around town errands because it is very comfortable and fun to drive. You mush have a &quot;to hell with gas mileage&quot; attitude to do this but it is worth it, mileage range from 9mpg city to 13.5mpg highway, with minor modifications.

I have a boat so towing was a factor and I have modified the exhaust and suspension systems to improve power and stability. The 350cid engine is as economical as most any V-8 on the market and very dependable. If you plan to use your vehicle mainly around town I would say you will not fully appreciate the versatility of this vehicle, and your frustration level from parking will escalate. For commuting, long trips, occasional off road use for fun, fishing, hunting, ect... you will love this vehicle.

On a scale from 1 to 10 I rate the 1994 GMC K1500 SLE Suburban an &quot;8&quot;, all things considered. My Suburban had 77,000 miles on it when I bought it, I paid $24,000 out the door with a 24 month, 24,000 mile bumper to bumper extended warrantee, I highly recommend it! The <br>
