                   We bought the Mercedes (like many who buy luxury cars) just to say &quot; Ha ha&quot; we have a Benz.  But, the car turned out to be more than just a head turner. The E320 is a sleekly designed toy!!! Its wonderful. It has almost everything you can think of. If you are interested in turning heads and being envied then this is the car for you. It has a smooth and easy drive and its extremely easy to handle. This particular Benz does not have heated leather seats! This lacking item is one draw back because you can find that feature in mid sized sedans. Everything else in the car is superior. The price is steep, but it is worth every dollar. Basically, if you are looking for class, style, and fun- the E320 is for you!<br><br>
