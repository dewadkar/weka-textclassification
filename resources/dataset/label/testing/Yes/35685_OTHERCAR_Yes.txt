            I received a 1995 Toyota Tercel in November of 1994 for my 16th birthday, I loved it then and I still love it now!
Of course I take good care of it changing the fluids and filters regularly, bathing it and taking it in for checkups, and so far, so good!
Within the first year of owning my car the tape player quit and the gear shifter (mine's an automatic) got stuck. But my nearest Toyota dealer was happy to help me out in a timely manner at no charge! To this day I've had no major problems with it, it handles well and runs smooth! I definitely recommend this model and year!<br><br>
