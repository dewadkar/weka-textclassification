            The Toyota Sienna is like the Camry of minivans. It does everything a min van should and it does it well. It rides smooth. It's comfortable. It's practical. And it's V6 engine provides powerful, reliable performance. This mini van is called the Camry of minivans because the engine is alike the on of a Camry. 

The Sienna is available with all the best features available in the minivan market: dual power sliding doors, modular seats, V6 engine, and car-like ride and handling. It's also a top performer in terms of crashworthiness. 

My families personal sienna has only one door and it is pretty simple inside, but like people say, �simple is good.� And if you don�t like simple there are the better models that you can buy that have a lot more features to them at a higher price. The Sienna doesn't hit any new home runs, but it does an excellent job of covering all the bases. 

All Siennas have a V6 engine with front wheel drive with a four speed auto transmission. There are three models the:  CE, LE and XLE. 
Despite its moderate length, the inside of the Sienna is roomy. My family took our first trip in it and I must say that the ride was very comfy and they cargo space was very roomy. The flip-and-fold seats make it simple to expand the cargo area as needed.  

The result is a minivan with a ride as good as is out there. A big, tall box will never ride and handle as well as a low, sleek sedan, but the Sienna is pretty darn good. It would be better, though, with a stronger suspension.  It soaks up bumps well, but leans a bit too much on corners. 
The Sienna lacks a few gee-whiz features that can be found on some of its competitors, notably the rear audio jacks on the Ford and GM models that let you and your kids enjoy separate music, and the OnStar navigation and emergency service package that can be ordered with GM minivans. 

	Overall the Sienna gives Toyota a great name and I strongly believe that this minivan is very acceptable for family and �soccer mom� use!
