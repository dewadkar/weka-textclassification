            I am a 30 years YOUNG and i would like to explain how COOL this car is. It brings back the old days of speed and crazy driving. When i bought this car it was a choice between the covertable mustang and the mazda miata, and of course i took test drives with them all. And i ended up buying the spyder, which i dont think i will ever regret. 

Here is why. 

First of all, this car is magnificent it has extremely good handling and has a very exquisite interior design.  The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder is the most wonderful car I can think of, it is sleek in a way no other car is. 

Handling: The handling is one of the most over looked aspects in a car, but when you drive the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder you cant over look it.  The handling is so fun that it brings out the teenager in a driver no matter what age.  Going speeds of 85 to 90 it still has the same steering and capability as it would going 45.  

Engine and performance: The standard of the GS includes A/C, power windows and locks, a CD player, and a 147-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. The top-level GT houses a 200-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, and the only problem i can see with this vehicle is the fuel economy with the bad aerodynamics. this car also looks allot sportier than it is. But donï¿½t be fooled, this car still is very capable of reaching speeds of 100 and 120. With either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission with a Sportronic sequential shifter, the engines provide enough power just to get by.  The driver maintains more control over gearing than in other manu-matic setups, however, because with sportonic, the transmission holds gears up to redline, at which point the throttle cuts out to prevent engine damage. This year, alterations are kept to a minimum, which amounts to illuminated visor vanity mirrors, a light in the glove box, and a couple of new exterior colors from which to choose.   

Interior: The interior of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder contains air conditioning, premium AM/FM stereo, seek scan, with an in-dash CD, 7 infinty speakers, an amplifier. Leather wrapped steering wheel with tilt adjustment, even with the capacity of 4 the Spyder is not lacking convience and comfort the seating of the spyder is the sport front seats, adjustable front head restraints, 6 way adjustable front seat and a four way adjustable passenger seat. premium clothed faced front seats with plastic side and back with a full cloth headliner.

Exterior: The exterior of this car is so sophisticated it includes a rear wing spoiler, side impact bars, and black side, and windshield molding. The exterior of this car is very sleek, although it is not very aerodynamic it does not take away the beauty. The exterior includes:  power convertible roof with lining, glass rear window, dual power remote black outside mirrors. Front and rear body colored bumpers, Aero-composite halogen auto off headlamps.

I think that this car is very personal if you are into a sports comvertable i would really suggest that you purchase this car. I did and i can say that it is a fun, exciting way to drive! I would not suggest this car to the family driver i dont even think a toddler would be comfertable in that back seat. But if you dont believe me about the ride, take a test drive. You wont regret it!
