            The cougar is one quick machine.  It's biggest asset is the way it corners at faster than normal speeds.  Gas mileage is excellent for this V6 averaging 31 on the highway.  I am confident in its brakes should I have to stop in a hurry.  And let's face it, this cat is sporty.  It's very comfortable if you're 5'10" and not overweight since it is a sports car meant for average size passengers.

On the negative, I bought the cat used last year.  Since then, I've needed a new iac motor, a new sunroof assembly (which extended warranties won't cover), a starter, and a flywheel.  These repairs total about $1,800 so far, but I go to the dealership for warranty work.  The automatic transmission doesn't shift too smoothly and has a problem deciding on 3rd and 4th gear.  Depreciation happens fast so get it used and you'll get a deal.
