            i bought the dscs70 because of the high resolution the viewfinder and the fact that the battery does not go dead after twenty or so pictures and i only bought it today but i am very impressed with it .

i did a few shots already with the battery running about 50% full strength and no problems at all.

the only shortcoming i can see is that there is no external battery charger included which i need since i got a extra battery pack and extra memory sticks.( to charge the battery you must plug the adapter into the camera and turn it off)

other than that the viewfinder is crisp and very well detailed the menu is easy to use installation on my pc was a breeze ( i run windows me)
and the picture quality is awesome as shown by my 21&quot; kds triniton monitor :-)

the best yet awesome job sony ........

i will add more when i put in more time in on the camera ........

well i have had the camera for almost a week now and i am seriously impressed the pictures come out great even in 640x480 resolution :-)


the mpeg movie recorder is awesome to use too but i suggest the 320 resolution if you want good one you want to e-mail out to family and friends.


if you do a lot of indoor or action shots i seriously recommend the external flash as the range of the built in flash is not as long as i wish it could be but there is a setting in the menu to make it extra bright if you wish.

another neat feature is the ability to change the brightness of the lcd screen which is nice except in bright light ( which all digital cameras have this problem )

the viewfinder is nice too as the view changes as you zoom in on the subject ( only in standard zoom if you go beyond the 3x optical zoom you need to use the lcd screen to be accurate and the picture quality is not as good in digital zoom)

my favorite feature is the extra memory sticks and with two battery packs i easily went all day long without running out of memory or battery power at all (two batteries m style goes for 2 1/2 to 3 hrs each  without any problems)

i strongly recommend the starter kit for the cyber shot which includes a extra battery a extra 8 meg memory stick and a carrying case for $99.00

i recommend the external flash and at least 2-3 batteries and 32 megs of memory is a good idea if you are at all serious about photography.

my only downside is the sony web page is tough to crack and find what you need (such as software downloads) but this is a problem i can deal with without losing any sleep at all.

i have done over 300 pictures so far (actually the ones i kept ...lol)
and no problems at all.<br><br>
