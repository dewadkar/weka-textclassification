            I am now driving my second Toyota Corolla, my first a new 1996 model which I leased for three years. In 1999, I chose to purchase my current Corolla VE.

My 1996 Corolla was my first new car and what a choice! In three years, I replaced one item on that car, a wiper blade on the driver's side. I maintained the car reasonably well, but did not get fanatical about service schedules and that sort of thing. The fact is the car worked perfectly for three years without a hitch.

My 99 Corolla, like my 96, has an automatic transmission however unlike my 96 this one has the four cylinder engine with overdrive. While I would like to have a little more get up and go when highway driving, I rarely find myself needing more under the hood when passing.

I chose a light brown color with this model which I now regret since it shows the dirt much more so than my 96 model, which was more of a beige or gold color. 

As for interior, instruments, etc. I find the Corolla has a clean, sensible design with easy to read instruments, fan and airway ventilation, etc.

I would recommend the Corolla to anyone looking for reliability, quality, good resale value and peace of mind driving.<br><br>
