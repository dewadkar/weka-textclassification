            HONDA ACCORD V6-THE ROAD MORE TRAVELLED

Can millions of Accord drivers be wrong in the road they chose???

I have been searching for a new sedan to replace my aging Acura Integra. The integra has been running well for over 10 years without even a hiccup of a problem. This sort of bulletproof reliability predisposes me to buy another Honda/Acura product. Being frugal (cheap) I thought I should start my search with Civics, but these are a bit too small for my 6'2&quot; height and also a bit on the cheap side in terms of finish and overall appearance. The Honda Accord seemed like a logical choice. That is one of its main problems, if you do your calculations everything seems to suggest the Honda Accord as an optimal solution for a family sedan. This is why you see a billion of them on the road every day. The Honda Choice is the road more traveled. In the case of less reliable cars, the Saab 9-3, most American cars or VW comes to mind, there is sometimes a reason not to go that road-higher maintenance costs, more headaches, less performance. 

Impressions
Outside
This is Honda's biggest drawback. The car is so uninspired and bland that its hard to pay a big chunk of money for it. Part of this impression may be that you see swarms of Accords on the highway like locusts. If not for the alarm remote, you might not ever be able to find which one is yours in the parking lot. Adding to the lack of charm is Honda's perpetually putrid color palette it uses on the Accords. It seems like most of the color choices are some shade of black. There is also a color, Heather Mist which is a cheap looking gold color that looks like its from a crayon (one of those 425 Crayolas that don't get used much), there is also a sick looking vaguely purple silver called Signet Silver-an odd purple grey coloration. I think that Honda reserves their best color schemes for Acura to try to upsell people.  I will say in its favor that the Honda is a much better looking car than its arch rival the Toyota Camry. The Camry to me has always looked a lot cheaper and smaller. 

Inside
Inside things improve. The layout is logical and well put together. There is a solidness to all the buttons and controls. The radio and CD player is nice, but I was a bit surprised that for the top of the line Accord flagship they did not use a Bose sound system. Again this improvement is reserved for the Acura lineup, which also features a much improved speaker setup. The seating is comfortable, but the leather feels a bit cheap, more like vinyl. The leather in the acura lineup seems to be a higher quality. The seats seem to lack some support in the legs, but in general are good. Visibility is terrific both forward and back. There is also an abundance of storage space. 

Performance
The base 4 cylinder is not very peppy. It will move, but only after high RPMs that will make the engine whine. The V6 is a whole other story. This silky smooth engine provides power effortlessly and is extremely fast and accelerates well. The car is so quiet that you might go to turn the ignition key again because you may not notice its on from the sound. The automatic shifting, using Honda's grade logic shifter, is incredibly smooth and well done. Its difficult to believe that an engine can be done any better, until you look at the Acura TL, which is just slightly better (25 more horses) and some more engine active and passive vibration damping added. For cars in its class the Honda is superb. The car is so well behaved that I kept having to check the speedometer to keep from going too fast. Its not a sports car, and will lean into turns and nose dive on hard stops, but will comply precisely with whatever the driver commands. 

Overall:
Test driving the vehicle will confirm that this is a great, incredibly well engineered vehicle. Performing comparisons to other available vehicles should tell you that Honda has hit the perfect sweet spot for all the cars attributes in creating what is arguably the perfect family sedan. You really can't go wrong with this decision and will surely feel no buyer's remorse. Well cared for the car should give you at least 250,000+ flawless miles of driving with superior performance. Perfection can be boring, but if you judge cars by value and economy, not style or charm-go for this car. I would recommend looking hard at the Acura TL, since the gap between the Honda/Acura pricing is not that great, compared to the gap for Passat/Audi or Camry/Lexus. This comparison makes me lean more towards the more unique, more exciting TL for an extra $4K or $5K.

Rivals:
VW Passat: This car has won a lot of best family sedan awards. Its in the same price ballpark-a bit higher when similarly loaded. There is no doubt that the reliability will not be as good as a Honda, but performance is slightly better. If your going to lease, go for the Passat-it will be more fun and reliability should be good at least the first 3 years. 
Camry-the big arch rival in the family sedan arms race. This is the car that drives Accord to evolve to better and better incarnations. Camry is the best selling car in America. This seems to be because Accord has gotten more and more expensive as it has improved. Camry is a cheaper alternative, while still being a  fine automobile. Given the choice I would go with the Accord, but test dive both to see what you think.
