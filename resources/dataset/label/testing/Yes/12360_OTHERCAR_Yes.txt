            My lease on my 1997 Sable is up in August 2000.  Here are some of the problems I have had with the car since leasing it in 1997.  Mind you, the car now only has 12,300 miles on it as of this week.

All service on my car was done at the dealership I leased the car from - Lincoln/Mercury in Hempstead, NY, so when I refer to &quot;they&quot; I mean the dealership service department.

There is a thin strip of decorative molding that goes around the top of the car, over the doors - this started to come off my car after one month. They needed my car in the repair shop for 3 days to fix this problem.

Next the plastic piece that you push to move the drivers seat forwards/backwards kept coming off, again, another day in the shop for this because they had to order the part. They said they used crazy glue to hold it on - I don't think they were joking.

Three months into my lease, the molding around the door started coming off again.  They &quot;fixed it&quot; somehow, and now it only looks like it is partially coming if there are bumps now in the molding where they &quot;fixed it&quot; - 

About 6 months into my lease, the drivers side window started to sound as if there was air coming through it - they replaced the rubber molding, &quot;to satisfy the customers complaint&quot;, as I was told, and said that it was most likely my A/C or defroster that I am hearing when it is on.  Funny how I can still hear the noise when the A/C, heat, defrost are all off!

About 1 year into my lease there was a recall on the seatbelt mechanisim, which I was told was already taken care of, prior to me leasing the car - yet to this date my seatbelt will still locks in place, as if I had just slammed on the brakes, for no apparent reason.

About 2 years into my lease the factory installed tape deck stopped working - another 2 days in the service department because they had to order the part.

About 2 1/2 years into my lease something went wrong with the fuses in the car and my lights, blinkers and horn didn't work properly - I had to leave the car 2 days before they found the problem.

Now my lease is coming to an end, the new problem now is when I close the drivers door, and all other doors are closed in the car, the &quot;door ajar&quot; idiot light stays lit on the dashboard, the ceiling light stays on, and I can't lock my doors either manually, or with the lock button, because when the door is ajar, the lock pops up automatically. (The only way I can duplicate some of this is by turning the ignition off, leaving the key in the ignition and locking my door, then closing it - the door lock pops up so I won't lock the keys in the car.)  This is an intermitant problem, which Mercury Services hasn't been able to duplicate as of yet.

There is also a blind spot from the frame of the car when  you look at the left side of the windshield.  I actually have to tilt my head sideways to make sure there's nothing on the left side of the car.  

I also don't like the trunk of the car, although it is rather large and roomy and has the fold down back seats to put long items in it, you are very limited as to the size boxes you can get in the trunk because of how the back end of the car meets the trunk hood. The back wall of the trunk goes up about 7 inches from the trunk floor. 

The interior of the car is roomy, ours has a light tan interior, it has held up fantastically even with the abuse it gets from my 2 boys - the car still looks new in the inside. (If you have kids, buy the cheap clear plastic floor mats and leave them on the car floor, they take all the abuse!)  The seats are comfortable.  I was about to fit 2 carseats in the back seat at the same time and a rather thin adult between them. 

My car gets about 15 to 20 MPG, mostly because I do alot of stop and go driving - locally.  We have used the car on a couple of road trips and the cruise control came in handy for that.  There is adequate leg room in the front passenger side of the car.  

The car ran smoothly, and other than the problems I mentioned above, I have no other complaints about the car.  :)

Also, at no time was I given a &quot;loaner car&quot; during any of the times they had to keep my car for repairs, the &quot;loaner cars&quot; were reserved for the &quot;Lincoln&quot; owners and not the &quot;Mercury&quot; owners.
