            I purchased this digital camera, because I am very bad at developing film. I currently have about 20 rolls laying around my house, waiting to be developed. Some are from when I was in the Army in 1993. Needless to say, a digital camera is just what I needed.

We decided to purchase a camera with part of our income tax refund. We didn't know what brand we were going to buy just yet, but we didn't want to spend over $300.

We went to our PX on post and saw the Polaroid PDC700 at $249.00. It's got a maximum resolution of 1024x768, and an auto-timer. Most other cameras in this price range I've seen only have 640x480. It doesn't, however, have zoom on it. 

It came with a 4 meg memory card, 4 batteries, camera to computer cable, camera to TV cable, camera case, wrist strap, ac power adapter, ac power adapter cord, Polaroid PhotoMAX Image Maker Software CD-Rom, and Polaroid PhotoMAX Pro Software CD-Rom.

I've played with it alot in the last few days, and I'm very satisfied with the pictures. I've heard a few people complain about the image quality, but I have to disagree. While it may not be up to par for a professional photographer, for everyone else, I'd say the image quality is great.

It also comes with an LCD screen to preview your pictures, and either keep or delete them. Keep in mind, the images will look better on your computer screen than they do in the LCD screen. That's not to say that the LCD screen is bad. It's just smaller, and pictures look a BIT grainier than they do on our computer monitor.

The software included with this camera is really fun, too. You can touch up the pictures, and add special effects if you'd like to. There are alot of effects, some of which are embossing, oil painting, and mosaic.

I also really like the sleek, expensive look of this camera. It's silvery-gold, and dark grey, and quite compact. Small enough, in fact, that the camera case has loops on the back so that you can slip it onto a belt. This is nice for people who are in busy areas, and might be worried about it being stolen. Personally, I'm going to sew a heavy-duty strap to the inside, so I can wear it like a purse, since I don't wear belts.

The ONLY slightly negative thing about this camera is that the batteries don't last long. Ours lasted a day, but keep in mind, we shot ALOT of pictures. We've learned that when we are in the house, we need to use the AC adapter, and save the batteries for when there aren't any plugs around. I would recommend getting 2 sets of rechargable batteries, so that while you use one set, the other is always charging, thus cutting down on the cost of batteries.

All in all, I'm very happy with the price, performance, and image quality of this camera. It was the least expensive I had found, and was nicer than the other more expensive ones I had looked at. This is one purchase I definitely won't regret.
