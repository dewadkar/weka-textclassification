            Chevrolet has done it once again; they've cranked out the strongest, toughest, most powerful truck on the road for the new millennium. It out runs Dodge, it overpowers Toyota, and it buries Ford six feet under. My family has always owned GM vehicles. My mother owns a '97 Pontiac Sunfire, I own an '83 GMC 1500 pickup, and my father just purchased a brand new 2000 model Silverado 1500. As I'm sure you can tell, I think this truck is incredible. First to start with the appearance. Simply put, this truck looks great. Continuing with the new style of '99, the Silverado has gained a sleeker, more rounded profile, similar to but surpassing its competition. The truck is more streamlined and aerodynamic, yet when it comes hurtling down the road, it's still the image of intimidation. Secondly, its comfort and versatility options are extremely admirable. A larger interior provides far more usefulness, as well as comfort. And the comfort doesn't stop there. Bucket or bench seats, extended cab or regular, the great looking interior provides an outstandingly smooth, quiet ride with tons of cool options. And lastly, this truck is a titan. Whether you choose the mighty 6 cylinder or the Herculean 8, which by the way is rated the strongest in its class, Chevy won't let you down. From towing or pulling a heavy load with a Dooly, to overcoming boggy swamps in a Z-71, to leaving the competition in the dust with the Sport package, the Silverado is a gold medallist Olympian of trucks. And, it never stops. &quot;Like a rock.&quot; It is also rated the longest lasting truck on the road. So, if you're looking for a high quality, full-size pick-up, look no further. The Silverado has arrived.<br><br>
