            Ever heard the phrase &quot;They don't build em like they used to.&quot;?

My family bought this car used, not sure when, but it's a 1987 model. In my opinion, it still runs like a dream. I don't have many miles on it at all, close to 150,000 I think (I don't have it with me in Boston where I go to school) but I cannot stress this enough - the car is a dream come true.

First, girth. The sheer size of this thing has earned it the nickname &quot;The Tank&quot; by me and the rest of the family. It's like driving a house. Every person who has ever been in my car takes to the nickname at once - &quot;Damn.. that car is HUGE!&quot; Indeed, it feels like you would barely notice a small nuclear explosion from 100 meters. Inside? Let's put it this way. the back seat reclines. Seat (butt) heaters? Check. In the rear seat too?? Double check. Radio? Yup-yup. Two different horn sounds??? Damn right! (and one of em could scare a T-Rex off the road) CD player?? well.. now we're pushing it...

Music - That's where the favoritism falters. The sounds system. Maybe i've just been spoiled by the amazing systems found in most luxury cars today, but this system is only &quot;very good&quot; and for those of us who have heard the rest, there is no comparison. And... well there's that gosh darn CD player problem..

Performance - Back to the good stuff. The ride. &quot;560&quot; means a 5.6 liter engine and wow, this thing MOVES. Amazingly, at the highest speeds there's still power in reserve to pass cars that weigh a fraction as much. How can something so big move so quickly? Rather scary.

Looks - Drop. - Dead. - Georgious. I just wish mine were black instead of navy blue. This thing is the size of a house, shaped like a bullet ( a very large, large bullet) and, like a suit, an old Benz never ever goes out of style.

Comfort - I can save my favorite seat position so that when i come home during breaks I can immedietly undo the damage the rest of the family does with the press of a button. I will never be able to find a chair more comfertable for my future house. Maybe I should buy another one of these and tear out the chairs... hmm.. the back seat could serve as a sofa...

Odds and Ends - Well.. I haven't mentioned it yet but, my car is possessed. Once, for about a day, the second horn didn't work. The brakes for some reason seem to get squeeky as hell very very often. Maybe it's the sheer weight of the car, or the fact that we cannot find a mechanic worth a damn in my town. The tape deck dies, randomly, sporaticaly. And since whomever had this car before us took such horrible car of it, the transmission fluid pan has huge holes in it, one door is starting to squeek when closed. The things that give charm and life to a machine. 

Overall Rating? Well, this car makes my family fear for my life. I simply fell in love with it and I push it's limits every single day. If I were to drive the same way in any other car.. and i do.. i'de be in grave, grave danger. If there was a 6th star, i'de give the Tank just that.

Ladies and Gentlemen, experience the truest meaning of -Quality- <br><br>
