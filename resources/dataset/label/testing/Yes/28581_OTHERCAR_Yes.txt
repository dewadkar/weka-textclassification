            I recently purchased a 2000 Jeep Wrangler Sahara.  With the options I got it turned out being about $27,000.  I must admit that the 4WD is very good even though it is such a light car!  I think it is a fun and cute car.  The inside leaves a little to be desired as far as luxury, but I suppose it wasn't meant to be a luxury car.  
There are a couple of things that annoy me about this SUV.  One is since the doors can be removed they tend to swing open very freely and I have bumped my door into things, or its a bother to make it stay open if I'm trying to unload or load my car.  Another thing that bothers me is the lack of space sometimes, but I guess you have to know that before you buy it.  I had never been in one when I did buy it and I think if I had known it was such a bother to get people in and out of the back seat I would have thought twice.
The annoyance that takes the cake for me is the noise of the soft top.  It is SOOOOO loud!  I highly suggest getting the hardtop, which is what I did.  I bought both so that it wouldn't be such an ordeal to take the top down in the summer, but I can't stand highway driving without my music so loud I can't here myself think, but I also can't here the roof.  It is very annoying if you want to talk to someone while you're driving.
Now that I have put it down, I should say that it is quite a fun car for downtown driving.  It is extremely easy to parallel park and you look quite cute cruising around in it!  If you do buy this car make sure you get a good sound system put in because it doesn't come with one! <br><br>
