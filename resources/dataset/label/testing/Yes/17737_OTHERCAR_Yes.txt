            After my 1992 geo metro decided to go caput on me, my husband and I had to buy another vehicle. We had a 6month old at the time and lived in the city, and I didn't want to be stuck without a car while my husband was at work. (nevermind the fact I didn't want to have to get me and baby ready to drive hubby to work) 

I was pretty sure I wanted a Saturn (I didn't know about the LS series or the SL series) so we went to a Saturn dealership on a Sunday afternoon. (yep, here in VA they're open) We were greeted at the door by the NICEST salesperson ever! 

He took us to his desk, complimented us on our great baby, who had a lot more hair than his son (grin) and asked us what we wanted in a car. We said it must have A/C (my metro DID not and it sucked big time), must be automatic (since I can't drive a manual), have power brakes/power steering, and well, it'd be nice if it had at least a cassette player and it HAD to be 4 doors.. that's a MUST!!

He took us out to this hunter green car that was LOADED! (I mean it too, completely loaded.. power everything!, CD/Cassette player, A/C, cruise control, anything you could imagine you'd want). It had 14miles on it :) So my husband, my son, and I took it for a test drive (I drove since the car is mainly for me anyhow)

The car rode so smoothly, was easy to install my son's carseat (Evenflo On My Way, and now, Britax Roundabout), and was just so much fun to drive. My ONLY complaint is the turning radius on it sucks. I've found myself having to back in and out of tight parking spots a few times to make sure I don't hit the car on either side. 

All in all it's a great car, GREAT service, (took it in only once so far to have the oil changed.. which reminds me, I need to take it in again for State Inspection, Emissions, and oil change again), and we love it! Our next car will probably be a Saturn from the L-Series, but we have this car for another 2years (Leased)
