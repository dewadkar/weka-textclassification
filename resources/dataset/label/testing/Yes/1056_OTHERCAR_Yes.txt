            The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a great car for everything. Snow, Family, Long Drives, you name it its got it. The Jeep Cherockee has a great sterio with plenty of sound and quality. The car is for all types of people because it is an all around car. You will feel at home with this car and safe so you will have no worries.  I bought this vehicle because it was a great car for a reasonable price. The part i love about the car is that it is smooth to drive and very comfortable. The Grand Cherokee is one of the greatest cars you could buy because it can do anything. So if you are thinking about buying a Jeep i recomend it very highly. <br><br>
