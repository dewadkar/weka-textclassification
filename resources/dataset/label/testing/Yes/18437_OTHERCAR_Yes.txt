            The Corolla I now have is my third Corolla, and every one has been reliable -- I've never had any problems. I also pay a very low monthly lease payment, which is a high priority for me because I don't need it as an accessory -- I'm not in it for the glamor, I just want to get from point A to point B!

I highly recommend Corollas, even though I really didn't like the idea of buying a &quot;non-American&quot; car at first. Even when we've car-shopped at Ford (for my husband, who likes Mustang Cobras), and I've told them I have a Corolla, the salespeople have said you can't get a more reliable car than a Corolla (which was surprising, coming from Ford people). And I drive a lot at night, so I don't want a car that's liable to break down!<br><br>
