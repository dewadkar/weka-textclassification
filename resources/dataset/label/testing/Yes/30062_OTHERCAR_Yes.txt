            Maybe it's because this is my first digital camera, but I am enthralled at the technology and features of the Kodak DC280 Zoom camera. The quality of the pictures are comparable to standard 35mm taken with a high-end camera. The DC280 is packed with settings and choices such as: Quickview; Multiple Flash Options; Close-up Capability; Date Stamp; Adding Borders; Capturing In Color, Black &amp; White or Sepia Tone; 3 Choices of Picture Quality; Picture Resolution Choices; White Balance; Metered Photos; ISO Settings; Sharpening or Softening Pictures; Viewing Pictures on TV etc. etc. 

The owner's manual is detailed and easy to follow. The best price I found was at Buy.com for $599. and it came with a 32 MG Flash Card and they are sending a promo free flash card reader when they are back in stock. This is an excellent camera and a great value. For those of you who trade on E-bay or other auction sites, try the website www.picturebay.com. It's an easy way to transfer your auction photos to your auction pages. Another great help is www.xdrive.com if you have a lot of pictures to store and you don't want to use up your hard drive space for storage. This free site stores them for you and you retrieve them when you want.

 For printing photos, look into www.shutterfly.com. Their prices are reasonable and when you consider the cost of photo paper and inkjet cartridges, it's a good deal. They are currently running a promotional special where you get the first 200 pictures free. For those who have a Pentium III computer, try the Intel Web Outfitter site. There you will find exciting and unique programs for your digital pictures.&lt;/b&gt;<br><br>
