            The Pros:  We bought our 3rd Honda Accord in 98 and it has been a wonderful car to own and drive to college for 3 years.  It is very economical, including good gas mileage (26-30mpg), and was virtually maintenance free.  It never burned oil and we never had to send it in for repairs since we bought it.  And as we all see on the commercials Honda makes very low emission cars.  Neato.  Maybe I lucked out on finding a truly lemon-free deal but I think that Honda holds high standards on their cars.  Another pro is that there seems to be many Honda dealers and mechanics who work on Hondas alone and, if you do happen to have a problem with your Accord, then it is easy to find a mechanic who is a Honda aficionado and who will work on your car with a smile on his (or her) face.  

The Cons:  I am a relatively large man and the seats were a nightmare to sit in for more than 10 minutes at a time.  Every Honda we owned has also had a leak around the window seal so when driving on the interstate there is a constant "sssss" of wind eeping into the car.  Not too bad but VERY annoying.  Finally, there just seems to be too many Green Honda Accords out there... especially if you have owned 3 more before this one.  

If you are thinking of buying a car then I would recommend this car to anyone--college kid, or... non college kid.

So I did the unthinkable and sold a perfectly good car.  Well, it happens, and I think I am ready to try another brand of autos for a while.  I drove to Pennsylvania and bought a 1977 Mercedes Diesel that smokes more than my grandpa.  Don't ask why.
