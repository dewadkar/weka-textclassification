            I recently &quot;upgraded&quot; my Saturn SC2 from a 1997 &quot;no bells-and-whistles&quot; to a 2001 &quot;fully-loaded&quot; model. I was quite excited about getting a new Saturn, as I loved my old one. I made the change because I wanted all the options (power everything, sun-roof, cruise-control, leather interior) I couldn't afford when I bought my first one 3 years ago.   

My shopping/buying experience was much the same as last time (though I did run into a rather pushy salesman, whom I promptly &quot;dumped&quot; for the sales manager). I was disappointed that I had to sit for almost 2 hours at the dealership the day I picked it up, since again I was promised it would &quot;take no longer than a half-hour&quot; to get everything processed and done.  However, the associates there were polite and I had a nice chat with the sales manager while I waited.

The car itself is great!  I did have to &quot;settle&quot; for an automatic, rather than my usual stick-shift (they searched the entire Southeast, and no one had a fully-loaded, leather-interior, stick-shift, dernit!!).  Though I was told there was &quot;more space&quot; and &quot;more headroom&quot; inside, I really can't tell the difference.  But, that's fine for me as I never had a problem with it's roominess in the first place.  

The ride itself seems quieter and smoother (than my 1997 model) - and the handling is still great.  Everything works well, and I'm <i>quite</i> pleased with it.  

My only real complaints are:  

1) The huge blind spot on the driver's side due to the third door.  Gone are the days I can just check my mirror &amp; look over my left shoulder to see if someone's coming up beside me.  I have to look in both mirrors, look over my shoulder,then wait a few seconds and check again, otherwise, I'm sure I'll miss someone someday.

2) I don't like that the &quot;buttons&quot; (for the power locks, windows &amp; mirrors) are in different places.  The window &amp; mirror controls are on the center console, while the lock control is on the door itself. Again, just have to get used to it.

Price has gone up, but is still quite reasonable.  Gas mileage has stayed pretty much the same (around 30/MPG). Stereo-system sounds decent and it has good pick-up (for an automatic, that is). All in all, I love it!<br><br>
