            Have only owned it since Oct 03, have logged 7K  miles - some highway - none off road.  Did take a 2002 off road for 15 minutes.  Amazing ability, the truck does what the maker says it will do AND the 2003s are supposed to do it better.    

Like my D90, the Discovery's gas mileage is horrendous.  This is a very thirsty truck AND Land Rover suggests that you use only premium fuel.  Whatever....

So far, no major problems - a windshield wiper stopped working, an interior fitting worked it's way loose and now I get some kind of weird schizophrenic seal breach around the windshield at highway speeds.  Otherwise, no problems...yet...I'll keep my fingers crossed.  

Again, if you choose to purchase a Discovery, be prepared for huge dealership attitude and to encounter a segment of Discovery owners who act like and think they are driving Range Rovers or G Wagons.  Hey, get a grip.  It's a $40K truck.

Actually it's not a $40K truck.  Mine is an HSE and was truly not worth over $35K.  Sticker was $41.5K.

Brake pedal placement was not well thought out.  Be very careful, it is very easy to hit both pedals (as I did) in an emergency.  Poor driver side legroom, steering column range of adjustment, and window control placement.  CD changer is under the passenger seat half protected behind a handful of cheap plastic.  The combination radio navigation system leaves a bit to be desired - it's a weird weird design.  The regional radio system sucks.  Once you get it all figured out, it's manageable.

Overall, I'm pretty much indifferent.  It's an okay truck, only worth the $$$ if you can get a good deal.
