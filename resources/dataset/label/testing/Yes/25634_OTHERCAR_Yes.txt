            I bought this auto due to Saabs long standing reputation for quality and performance with styling and color which really appealed to me. I have not been disappointed. The car has had virtually zero defects and performs well under all driving conditions. The car is responsive with the the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; one would expect in a 35K + vehicle. Excellent in rain and snow. I think this car would appeal to anyone who is looking for a high performance luxury vehicle. I looked at a number of comparable vehicles (Audi A6, Lexus, BMW, Accura and Cadillac Catera) and this one stood out in my mind in style, price and performance. I rejected Mercedes and BMW due to rear wheel drive - a no starter in New England. <br><br>
