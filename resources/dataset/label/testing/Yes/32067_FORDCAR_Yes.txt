               I bought a the explorer about 4mnths ago and I LOVE it! (It is a 96' model) I get about 17miles/gallon in the city.   It has plenty of cargo room, great if you have kids on the run.  It is also very comfortable for road trips.  Before I bought it I read the consumer guide report on it.  The only problems it has is electrical.  (as would any vehicle after a period of time, this was also rated as less than 14%).  It drives smooth and if you want you can get the &quot;extras&quot; such as the 6 cd changer in the console (very convienent).  The price wasnt too bad either it only cost me 11,000 with the cd player and alarm.  I recommend this vehicle to anyone that truly wants the best of their vehicle.

P.S.  The explorer has given me nothing but satisfaction.  The only reason its been to the shop is for an oil change.<br><br>
