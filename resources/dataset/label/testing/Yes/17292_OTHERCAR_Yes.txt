            I have to admit, that when I got this camera home, and opened it up, I was severely disappointed to find that there was no flash.  I was so excited about the price, that I hadn't even thought to check for one.  Being an experienced photographer,  I have some great quality photographic equipment at home, but after all that, a digital camera was just way out of my price range, even so, I thought it would be fun to have a camera to get quick pictures without a lot of fuss.

The pictures are not great, they are fuzzy if the subject moves.  They are pretty pixelized if you print them, or try to enlarge them at all.  A cheap photo editing program works wonders on even the worst shots, to brighten, and overall make them look better.  Outdoor shots seem to turn out wonderfully.  I took pictures of my son's birthday party outdoors, and they weren't bad at all.  The shots are much sharper in very good light.  If there is no light close by, even in a lighted room, the picture will not turn out at all.  
This review may be critical, but I paid 35 dollars for this camera.  An absolute steal,  and now I will stop telling you all the bad points, and express how much I love this camera.  I have about 10 rolls of film in my desk drawer that have been hanging around for who knows how long, simply because I haven't gotten around to developing them yet.  However,  I have disk after disk, month after month, of photographs.  I can look back at my disks, and watch my children grow, and mature, month by month, without using much space at all.  These pictures, packed into photo albums, would take up an entire shelf of their own.
No scanning to do, no film to develop.  It is that simple.
Not to mention the fact that you can delete all of those unwanted pictures that didnt turn out.  My 4 year old can use this camera.  He can take all the photographs he wants to, (under mommy's watchful eye) without wasting any film.  He has gotten quite good at it.  I often upload shots off of my camera, only to find strange visions of toes, the carpet, and even the toilet.  And he thought I would never know.  He still doesn't understand how I always find out.
