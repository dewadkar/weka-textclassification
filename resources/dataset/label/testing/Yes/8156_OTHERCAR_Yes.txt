            I don't actually own one of these, but I have had the opportunity to use my moms.  I love this camera.  It's so easy to use.  It takes up to 64 quality pictures and you can see what you are taking and delete anything that you don't like right on the spot.  I have a very cheap camera, that is not listed in the product review and it only takes 10 quality pictures and it has an optical view finder.  In order to see your pictures you have to download them to the computer first.  

Another thing I like about the Polaroid is it comes with everything you need to start taking pictures.  Even the AC adaptor.  Some companies don't include this and it's an extra expense.  

It believe it comes with the Photo Max software and it is so easy to understand and operate.  I was up and running in less the 10 minutes, with a little help from my mom.  

My camera doesn't have a flash this one does.  Don't buy a camera without a flash.  You'll only be able to use it outside and it's just not worth it.  

I highly recommend this camera.  It's great for taking pictures of items for Ebay, which is what my mom uses it for.  

For the money this is a great little camera.  I believe when my mom bought hers she paid about $300 for it and I know they come down a little in price.<br><br>
