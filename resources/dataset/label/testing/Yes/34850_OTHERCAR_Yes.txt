            Like so many other people, I never thought I would purchase a minivan. The whole image of &quot;soccer mom&quot; or &quot;stay-at-home&quot; dad never appealed to this married, child-free 31-year-old male. Daily I drive a two-seat sports car and my wife drives a German station wagon. Our third vehicle for use as bookstore merchandise transporter, dog mover, mulch machine and hay hauler has for the past three years been a '96 Dodge Ram pickup truck. The truck was fine and all, but it couldn't hold 7 people comfortably or carry 4 people, 4 dogs and enough luggage for a week's vacation. This had become a problem.

In walks the world of the minivan. After bandying about the idea of a PT Cruiser (too small and too dear a price right now), a Mazda MPV (we liked the idea of another Mazda to compliment the sports car, but it was too small and underpowered) and even considering a sport utility or 4-door pickup truck, we decided on our Honda Odyssey EX/Navi.

The handling of this vehicle, though not on par with either of our other vehicles, is impressive. Not one to be shy about entrance ramps or twisty roads, I've thrown this van through the curves with aplomb. It handles like a top-heavy, front-wheel-drive minivan, but it's sporty enough in the feel to keep me happy when I must drive the van.

It's stylish. There aren't very many of them on the roads, relatively speaking, and the lines and edges of it are just attractive in a utilitarian manner. There are just enough touches of chrome to accent the bright white paint that all of our cars are purchased with. The power side doors are perfect for putting items inside when your hands are so full that you can't pull on a door handle. I don't even mention the &quot;gee whiz&quot; factor of remote-controlled access to a vehicle.

The interior is very comfortable for all involved. We bit the bullet and had aftermarket leather installed. Note to Honda: Offer leather like you do on the home-market LaGreat. People will buy it. I do have a problem with the seats. I don't feel like there is enough support for my thighs. I also can't tilt the steering wheel down as far as I would like. If I do, I lose the upper third of the instrument cluster, hiding it behind the upper rim of the steering wheel. Passengers in the rear love the fact that they can control their own air conditioning. With vents in the ceiling over each chair, passengers have no problem keeping cool and adjusting things to their particular tastes and tolerances.

The navigation system is a breeze to use. I used it today to find a friend's house when we went over to brew beer. I had never been in the neighborhood before and was completely unfamiliar with the area. The navigation system took me right to their driveway without missing a beat. Getting the system confused is difficult. Go the wrong way or avoid some construction or traffic and it just recalculates the route, with the pleasant female voice directing you to the next most convenient route.

The stereo is a little wimpy, but very few stock stereos are decent. I may eventually change to a cassette deck and CD changer so that I can listen to audio books and still have Jimmy Buffett in the CD player. 

Fit and finish on this vehicle is second to none. I can't find a problem with the van anywhere. Everything is done with the typical Honda quality. One would never guess that this vehicle was built outside Japan.

The engine pulls eagerly on entrance ramps and cruises along at freeway speeds without a whimper. On some steep hills it will kick down a gear to maintain speed, but the cruise control eats up the miles without any fuss. Buzziness in the engine is relatively non-existent. Honda did a spectacular job in isolating the passengers from road noise.

Owning a bookstore, we move a lot of merchandise. The Odyssey swallows up boxes of books like nobody's business. Whether the third seat is folded away or boxes are put into the well behind the seat, it's not a problem to put several containers full of tomes inside.

I never thought I would like a minivan, but I honestly must say that Honda has really knocked the ball out of the park and set a standard for other minivan manufacturers to aspire to. They took the utilitarian soccer mom minivan and made it something that one would have never expected. They made it fun to drive. The stigma of being called a minivan owner/driver just got a little bit easier to bear.<br><br>
