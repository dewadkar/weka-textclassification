            FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I WONDERED IF LUXURY AUTOMOBILES WERE REALLY 
ANY BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE FAMILY SEDAN.  I HAD OWNED SOME REALLY NICE 
CARS [usually buying a new car every three years} BUT I HAD NEVER OWNED
ONE THAT FIT IN THE LUXURY CATEGORY.  TWO YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A CADILLAC
SEVILLE. I DIDN'T BUY IT TO IMPRESS THE NEIGHBORS OR MY GOLFING BUDDIES.
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD A CADILLAC AND WANTED TO SEE IF THEY WERE
WORTH THE THE PRICE REQUIRED TO OWN ONE.  MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN TOTALLY
POSITIVE. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NORTHSTAR ENGINE IS SUPER. IT CAN ACTUALLY
BE CONSIDERED A SAFTEY FEATURE. SEVERAL TIMES ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS
WHEN I HAVE BEEN IN TIGHT SPOTS THE POWER OF THE NORTHSTAR V8 HAS GOTTEN
ME OUT OF TROUBLE.  THE SEVILLE HAS THE BEST RIDE OF ANY CAR I'VE OWNED.
IT IS ESPECIALLY GOOD ON LONG TRIPS. THE EXTRAS INCLUDING HEATED SEATS,
AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS, AND BUILT-IN COMPASS MAKE DRIVING EASIER. IF THERE'S
ANY DISADVANTAGES TO OWNING THE SEVILLE I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED THEM. I'VE
ALWAYS HEARD THAT THE DOWNSIDE TO OWNING A LUXURY CAR IS THAT REPAIRS
ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. THE ONLY REPAIR I HAVE HAD, AFTER 82,000 MILES, WAS REPLACING THE
POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICE. THE COST WAS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON
ANY FULL-SIZE AUTO&gt; <br><br>
