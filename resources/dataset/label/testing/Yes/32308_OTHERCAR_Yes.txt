            I love this car! It's the third one I've owned. My first car was a 1992 Sentra. I had it for 4 years &amp; never had a bit of trouble. When the new model came out I traded it in for a 1995. I recently traded that in for a 99 model. Now I here they've revamped the Sentra &amp; a brand new 2000 model is coming out-Oh No! That is the only thing I don't like is that they keep changing the look! Other than that I think it is a great car! Nissan knows how to build a car. Being single &amp; a female who doesn't know a thing about cars I have always felt safe in my Nissan. I have never had any kind of problems &amp; the dealerships are always very helpful! I also love the look of a small sporty car (I have a 4 door w/spoiler) but is at the same time very roomy inside! They also come with great stereos &amp; speakers! I think anybody looking for an economical, easy to care for car should check out the nearest Nissan dealership! You'll be in for a treat!<br><br>
