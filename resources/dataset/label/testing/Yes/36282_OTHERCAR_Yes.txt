            I just purchased a 2001 Toyota Celica GT, so these are my last days as the owner of a '98 Corolla LE. This car comes highly recommended for its unbeatable engineering and quality in the low-priced spectrum of basic transportation. I purchased the LE new in Sept. 98 for $12,000, a great price since the sticker was above $16,000. It has all power, and everything works supremely well, including the air conditioning, which was essential in southern California where I originally bought and drove the car, and now in Tampa, Fla.
It's a well performing vehicle, but a little boring if it's to be your only ride. That's why I decided to go for a sizzling new Celica, which I'm sure will be as expertly assembled and engineered.
The LE gets great gas mileage of about 36 mpg on the highway and near 30 mpg around town. I have an automatic, which I recommend to anyone doing city or freeway driving. The stick would give a bit more ooomph in early acceleration, but becomes tedious in traffic.
This replaced a '92 Corolla, which also ran perfectly for six years with no major mechanical problems other than timing belt replacement, new shocks and struts and tires. The factory tires went an amazing 76k miles.
Back to the '98: Another good point is this car's top notch resale value. In trade, it just brought $11,500 from a Toyota dealer and retails locally for about $12k: the same price I paid new three years ago!
I have never had this car in for a warranty repair. Other than oil changes, nothing has ever gone wrong. There was a rattle inside one door, but it went away. I did replace the windshield when a rock dinged the old one.
The seats in front are comfortable and the upholstery wears well. The brakes are well made. The power systems, such as windows, locks and steering, function flawlessly.
The only caveat is styling. It's plain vanilla, but you already know that and don't care if you are interested in this car.
