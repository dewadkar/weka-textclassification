            I fell in love with my 1998 Silverado when I got it, but then the automatic transmission gave out at about 80,000 miles.  Now I have a Toyota Tacoma, with a standard 5-speed transmission that will last a lot longer.  I just didn't have $5,000 to get it repaired.  Besides, the Tacoma sits lower and is easier to climb into.  It was a real hassle climbing up into the Silverado.  Even so, I miss my Silverado.  It was a joy to drive.  The Tacoma is the only truck I like almost as much as my old Silverado.

The Silverado seats are a bit uncomfortable for small people like me (five feet, four inches), and they could be a little bit softer, but that's just quibbling.  The tilt steering wheel makes it possible to get into a comfortable position. 

The Silverado cuts right through the snow and ice, even uphill, even on a dirt road.  But watch out on the downhill, since 4-wheel drive is for going, not stopping.  Everything is hard to stop on the downhill, especially when it's icy.

It's a good-looking truck.  You can get it all muddy, and one pass through the car wash makes it look just like brand new.  This is not a little toy truck; it's  a workhorse that can haul a load, pull a trailer, and still take the whole family out to a restaurant or a movie.

It handles really well, too.  The power steering helps.  If you've ever tried to get a big truck into one of those tiny parking spaces that seem to be everywhere these days, then you know just how important handling is.  Now, of course, you can't get it into a compact space, but the ease of parking is so good that I found it hard to believe.  Nobody will yell an insult like "woman driver!" at me because the truck is so easy to drive.  I can even see what's behind me, unlike some vehicles that seem to hide everything beyond the back window. 

It's a solid, well-crafted truck that won't break down unless you give it tons of abuse.  Except the transmission, which wore out a lot faster than I expected.  It's easy to load and unload, even for a short person like me.  It looks handsome, too.  The radio sounds good, and the heat is delicious when it's snowing, and the cup holders are handy.  Oh, yes, and the air conditioner is yummy when it's a hot day out.  There are plenty of vents for driver and passenger to direct the fan where you want it, or shut it so that it doesn't blow on you. 

I miss my Silverado, even though I have the Toyota Tacoma.  I still want to get a Silverado with an extended cab.
