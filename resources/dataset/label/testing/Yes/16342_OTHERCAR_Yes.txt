            Hewlett Packard amazed me once again. My little camera is my baby now and I am very protective of it. I am, in no way, computer saavy but this camera makes it easy for you to get into the technological age. I did not even have to read the instructions to learn how to take the pictures. It's so much fun now.
The one thing I though it should come with some sort of strap to carry it around on. I did buy a camera bag though. I got my camera and bag at Target this last weekend for 299. I thought that was a great deal. I had been shopping around all weekend and for 300 dollars, it felt like a steal. 
I took my camera out of the box and it had many cables that came with it and  great instruction booklet.  I put the batteries that came with it in the camera and turned it on right away and started using it. Its soooo easy to use. I love it.<br><br>
