            I would like to update you on my experiences with the LS2 over the past 6 months.  I previously wrote &quot;LS2 a great car.&quot;  I still very much stand by what was written in that opinion.  The LS2 is indeed a great car.

I have had no major problems with the car so far.  The only minor issue was a squeaky windshield wiper, which Saturn happily fixed.  I have had no other problems since.  The LS2 has a nice feel about it when you drive.  It is a sturdy car and feels solid but not bulky.  It drives like a more expensive luxury car and has very little road noise.  My wife has been driving the car to practice for her driver's test.  She has felt very comfortable in it.

The huge trunk has definitely been helpful, due to our 6 month old son and all of his &quot;stuff.&quot;  The trunk easily fits his stroller with room for our bulk shopping at Costco.  Even with the car seat installed, there is enough room in back for 2 other passengers.  The automatic seat adjustment for the driver has also been very handy due to my wife and I being very different in size.  I am 5'11&quot; and she is 5'.  The seat adjusts up and down for height and the traditional recline and back and forth.  Having it electronically controlled makes it a lot easier though.  I have also been impressed with the keyless entry and alarm system that comes standard on the LS2.  To open and lock the doors as well as the trunk without using the key is great.  It prevents scratching the paint in the dark and makes it easier to get in and go.  The security system which disengages the ignition system and engages the horn if tampered with is also great.  Now I don't have to go out and buy an after market system.

The strength of the engine is also impressive.  The V6 was the best choice I made.  Acceleration is smooth and quiet.  People on the freeway look at you and think, &quot;was that a Saturn that just passed me by?&quot;  

I've heard that the 2001 model is coming out soon but will have very few modifications.  The body is not due to be changed for years.  I personally like the body styling.  I'm not too flashy anyway and it is definitely nicer to look at than the Camry.  Since 2001 models will be almost the same, please check out my review of the 2000 model, which I proudly own.  You will be pleased with this car.<br><br>
