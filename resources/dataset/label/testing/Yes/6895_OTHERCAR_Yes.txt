            I had committed to buying a Porsche Cayenne Turbo before it had even been out on the market. I was concerned about the photos I had seen of it and was not sure the looks would work for me. Even so, the promise of Porsche engineering in an SUV was enough appeal.

The car looks a lot better in the metal and the looks quickly grew on me although some of the more standard wheel options don't work so well. I got 20" wheels which I felt looked best on this car.

I have now owned my car for 13,500 miles and have been loving every single mile. Very comfortable with a very civil behaviour when driven leisurely, it turns into an absolute beast once you get it going. At best on the highway, it will expedite overtaking maneuvers breathtakingly and without drama. The 6 speed tiptronic works superbly and becomes quickly addictive during spirited driving. The claim of 5.5 seconds to 60 mph seems more than realistic as the twin turbos work effortlessly and with great effect. It puts to shame most of the best sportscars.

It is a heavy car so don't expect it to behave like a Boxster. There is a little more inertia in the handling but the air suspension does a great job of fighting the laws of physics. In the end, physics will win though but the limits will take a lot of guts to reach. The braking is good, but short of breathtaking. Under braking from treble digit speeds (e.g. coming off a highway onto a slip road), I have noticed repeatedly a noisy vibration in the brake pedal which does not inspire confidence. This might be the ABS at work but it is concerning that it should kick in so early on at high speeds. This may simply be down to the fact that there is simply too much mass and not enough rubber (see tire comment below).

Inside, the car is very comfortable, offers a very quite ride and the sound system is superb. A few niggly bits though. Why couldn't Porsche fit the cruise control commands on the steering wheel rather than confusingly next to the blinker column? And should a $700+ CD charger option not be of better quality?! The charger is flimsy, sits in a difficult to reach compartment in the trunk (try changing your CDs when it rains!) and does not offer shuffle function between CDs (an unforgivable omission at that price). Another really disappointing feature is the folding mechanism for the rear seats. Plan ahead of time because it will take you a few minutes and a good deal of patience to get them down. Porsche could take a few lessons from Infinity and their FX45. Once the seats are down, they work well although tall drivers will have a problem fitting the rear head rests where they are supposed to fit when the seats are down.

Still, the rest of the car works great inside. The Satellite Navigation is a treat (few errors experienced to date) and the memory electric seats very comfortable and easy to operate. Great headlights too.

I am afraid I have never taken it off road yet (how many of us will?) but, by all accounts, the Cayenne excels there too.

One big downside of this car is that it will munch its way through tires nearly as fast as it will guzzle a tankful of super premium unleaded. My front tires were totally shot after only 8,000 miles. What was particularly worrying was that the inside of the front tires were completely bold. After checking with my local dealer, it transpired that excessive wear had been reported on all Cayenne Turbos at about the same mileage, although no other had suffered quite as badly as to show thread. Rapid tire wear can be expected to some degree on a turbo car that heavy but this does seem excessive. At $375 a tire, extra budget should be set aside when buying this car.

I should also report that this car consumes quite a bit of oil, something one should expect from a Porsche although this is the heaviest oil consumption I have experienced to date in any Porsche. Nothing untoward though at this level of performance.

Generally, there is an overwhelming feeling of rock solid engineering. Porsche have done a great job on this car and truly created a new niche for this type of vehicle. I am fortunate to own some truly unique sportscars but the Cayenne is the car I want to take out almost every time.

Some people will be interested in gas mileage. I have averaged 14.5 mpg to date but do not do much town driving. Have a bit of fun and you'll struggle to best 10mpg.

This car would suit drivers who want the practicality of an SUV but the brutal efficiency of a true sports car. Interestingly, on highways, drivers will promptly get out of the fast lane to let this car through, and this is in a state where everybody owns the outside lane, no matter how slow they go.
