            This camera is suitable for a beginner or teenager, for the 
most of us who wish our pictures to be picture perfect, it can be very disappointing.

Image quality on this Kodak, from several feet away isn't very quality maintained. It sometimes seems blurry, as if the lens is slightly out of focus. Even if it were perfectly focused, it would still look pretty bad compared to images from 2 or 3 Megapixel cameras, which you can buy for a couple hundred dollars more than this camera. 

Colors are not saturated or accurate. The images appear faded and off color. This can be corrected using Adobe PhotoDeluxe which comes bundled with the camera if you like doing that sort of thing. 

If you're at just the right distance, the close up images from the camera are very good. The close up range is limited at times. Anywhere from a few inches away from the subject to about a foot is really the only useful range. Even then, the range where the image is in perfect focus is even smaller still. A few inches too far or too close results in a slightly blurred image or blackened out image all together if it's at a distance.
