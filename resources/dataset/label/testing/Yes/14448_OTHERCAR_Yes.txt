            so I wanted to get a car that was low-maintenance.  Other important factors included power windows, classy styling, nice to drive, gas mileage and roominess.  

We looked at a lot of cars in this class including Subaru (I already own a Subaru), Honda and VW.  After much research, we narrowed it down to the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry.  We liked both cars, but it just seemed like the Camry was roomier and a better deal for the money.

We've owned the Camry for about 4 years now, and it has turned out to be an excellent car.  Based on Blue book prices, it has held it's value quite nicely and it didn't before the car was worth more than what we owed.  I can't really think of one serious problem we have had with the car since we bought it.  About the only thing I might change about my initial decision is to upgrade to the V6.  The 4 cylinder version is slightly underpowered, especially when loaded down with family members.

Positives:
Styling
Reliability
Good gas mileage
Holds it's value

Negatives:
4 cylinder version underpowered
Handling (large turning radius)<br><br>
