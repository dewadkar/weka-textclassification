            Don't hold your breath waiting for a problem with the Infiniti J30. A problem may never come. This has got to be one of the most dependable cars on the road. It handles extremely well in wet weather, especially since we upgraded to Michelin tires. The car has incredible pickup, and a passing feature, where at 40 mph, you shift from drive to third gear for a "burst of Infiniti speed" on the freeway. This is our second Infiniti experience, and we have not been disappointed. The interior of the car is extremely attractive, and the stereo system will compel you to spend a little longer inside the car with your favorite CD.
We are approaching 90,000 miles and have only visited the dealer for our scheduled servicing, and oil changes every 3,000 miles. I have been to two area Infiniti dealers for service, and they know what service means. My warranty ended at 70,000 miles, and still no sign of trouble as we approach 90,000. 
As a driver, I appreciate the quiet engine, and the smooth 'top of road' ride. I'm always a little smug at having made a good choice in cars when people seem surprised that it's a 1994 model. Everyone thinks it's a newer car. The body integrity on this car is really holding up, and I don't even have it waxed very often!!! Another plus in the cosmetic durability would be the quality of the leather interior. It is still pristine and beautiful after six years!!! A great automobile.
