            I never considered myself a minivan person. I like to drive fast, like sporty type cars. I began researching, test driving many cars about 2 months ago. Originally I wanted an SUV, drove them all. Wasn't super impressed with any of them, but liked the room they offered. Tested quite a few mid-size sporty sedans, fun to drive, but limited space. When it came down to dollars & comparing the pros and cons of each vehicle = the Odyssey won! Even against the Sienna (newly designed for this year) Honda won hands down. 

We got a great price - $26980 for an 04 EXL with DVD. Bought no extras except for the extended warranty (got an ok price on that - 6 yrs 100k miles for $960). 

I love this van! The interior is so comfortable. Its a quality made vehicle. The leather interior is gorgeous. The instrument panel is easy to use, and easy to reach. The DVD system is wonderful. My children absolutely love it, and the wireless headphones. They love that they can control the dvd themselves, and even listen to different music than we do up front. The middle row captains chairs are very comfortable and in the separated position the kids love their own 'space'. The front seats have the heated seats, which are really great on cool mornings. 

The cargo area in the back is really useful. I like the 'hole' in the back (where the disappearing rear seat goes) for groceries. Things dont go rolling all over the place. With the third row seating in the hole, there is TONS of storage in the van. 

The van drives like a car. You dont feel like its a minivan at all. It handles well, the V6 is pretty powerful. Its hard to keep it at 65 on the freeway, its so smooth. Just driving along its hard to gauge how fast you are going. I find myself up around 80-85 often without even realizing it. I think I will start using the cruise control more often!

12/4/03 Update: We've had the van a little longer, here are more details!  Still absolutely love it, in fact the more I drive it the more things I find that I love about it. The transmission (automatic) moves between the gears unnoticeabely. It drives very smooth, acceleration even at high speeds is smooth. It does not have the torque pull when you step on it (like the Sienna). The brakes are responsive, and dont squeek. There is virtually no noise at all in the van on the freeway. There is a slight engine noise upon heavy acceleration but thats it. The front seats, and the second row captians chairs are extremely comfortable. My 12 year old son fell asleep in his! They all recline, the arm rests fold up out of the way if you dont like them. The heated front seats are becoming one of my favorite features of the van. They heat up quickly and really take the chill out of a cool morning.

The third row seat is very easy to put up and down. I keep it up for most purposes. I like the hole in the back (where the seat goes when its folded down) to hold bags and things. They dont go rolling all over the place. This hole is plenty big for a weeks' worth of groceries, or a couple sets of golf clubs. You do need two hands to put the seat up or down, and you do need a little bit of strength, but its really pretty easy. When its folded down, the back area is completely flat and you have tons of room! This van is very versatile! 

Update 12/05/03 Gas mileage - 3 tanks so far. All city driving. First one was 18mpg, second 16mpg, third, 19mpg. Doing some highway driving in the next couple weeks, I am anxious to see the difference. 

The side doors are really great. They automatically open with just a touch of the handle. They wont open at all if the car is not in park however. And you cant close them quickly, when you are in a hurry. Just a couple added thoughts!

The EXL is the top of the line, worth every penny! I dont have anything negative to say about it yet. We have about 500 miles on it and have loved every single one. My only mistake was getting the dark blue - it is going to be very difficult to keep clean. 

If you are in the market for an SUV or a VAN, make sure to drive the Honda Odyssey - you wont be sorry!
