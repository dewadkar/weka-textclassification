            The A80 is my second digital camera. I had a Kodak DX4330 which is a pretty good point & shoot model that did everything I wanted it to do, but it got water damaged on a boating trip in Florida so I needed to get something new.

I read all the reviews online and decided that the A80 would be what I should get. 

I wanted something a bit more powerful than what I had and a camera that offers the user control over the photographic process, but I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg, either. I liked the feel of the A80 in hand versus the Canon S50, and I thought the Canon G5 was just too expensive, and too much camera for me. Another model I considered was the Kodak DX6490 which is much more attractive, and has a more powerful 10x zoom lens, but no manual focus. Choices, choices.........none of them probably would have been a bad choice at the end of the day.....

So far after about 2 weeks of use, I find that the A80 is solidly made and easy to use, although I will say that for those of us coming straight from the point & shoot world, there  is a learning curve in order to understand a lot of the A80's features, and then to begin to use them. The best way to figure out all the features is simply to experiment - doesn't cost anything......

The picture quality of the A80 is very good, at least as good as the Kodak's was, although red eye does seem to be more of an issue with the A80 than it was with my old Dx4330. The zoom is precise and smooth, and a small amount of digital zoom does not seem all that detrimental to picture quality. I particularly like the read out telling you how much zoom you've used.

The software seems pretty straightforward and basic, although I don't think that any camera's own software is as good as Apple's iPhoto (free for Mac users) for ease of use, and for touch up Photoshop, or Photoshop Elements is really the way to go, but a person's gotta pay for that.

Another nice thing is that the A80 uses just plain old AA batteries...........yeah, you can get rechargeable ones, but why bother? You're off somewhere taking photos and don't have access to a stationary charger, so the throw-away batteries make sense to me.......all one needs to do is carry extras. I just wish it didn't need 4 batteries, though. Two would have been more convenient I think.

The A80 has an built-in lens cover which is a nice touch. My Kodak had a tethered lens cap which I thought was annoying.

My only complaint about the A80 is the small size of it's LCD monitor.......I wish it was a half-inch bigger. The swiveling part is nice, though. Also, it comes with only a 32MB compact flash, and you'll need to really get a much bigger one than only 32MB. The 128MB ones are pretty cheap these days.

All in all I can see why this camera is so highly rated. It's well built, had more features than one would reasonably expect for the price and is fairly easy to learn.

I'd recommend checking it out in your search. I think it is an excellent value.
