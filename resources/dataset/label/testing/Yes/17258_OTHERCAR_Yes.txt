            My husband and I purchased the Dodge Intrepid for a couple of reasons, first of all being that we needed a bigger car.  At a bout 6'0&quot; tall, my Dodge Neon was just not big enough for my husband to drive comfortably!  The Intrepid has more than ample room for his long legs.  In fact we have been amazed at the size of this car.  The back seat has tons of space, and the trunk is large enough for a small family to live in!  Well, I wouldn't recommend that, but it's big.  It keeps going and going.  We've actually had 2 big high school boys from church get in it with room to spare.  (They just wanted to see if they could fit)

Second reason we purchased the Intrepid was the ride.  The engine is a very powerful V-6.  It really gets up and goes.  Smooth would be the best way to describe the ride.  It is easy to drive, very good steering and just has that comfortable feel when driving.  The back seat ride is comfortable and smooth as well.

Our third reason for purchasing this car was the price.  We paid right at $17,000 for a demo model, and it was well worth the money.  I have always driven a Dodge car, from my first in high school to my 4th now, and have never had any problems with any of them as long as I owned them.  So we felt like the money was worth the product since we don't expect a lot of hassle.

I definitely recommend the Intrepid to anyone looking for a large, family car or someone who just needs more room.<br><br>
