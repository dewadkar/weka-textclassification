             When I was 18 years old I knew absolutely nothing about cars. So I was ready to get screwed over when I went to trade in my sad little 1986 Cadillac Cimmaron for a newer car. Thankfully, I ended up pleasantly surprised with the result of my shrewd business and bargaining skills, a 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier. It looked good, it ran good, and I was happy as a lark. In the past five years that car has been nothing but dependable. (Everyone please knock on wood here....thanks). Besides your basic maintenance, a couple clutches (which are probably my fault), and a few other minor things, this car has been a blessing. It has survived delivering pizzas for 4 1/2 years, a few road trips, and getting rear ended twice. Plus, it has a whopping 142,000 miles! I have no complaints, and my next car will be a cavalier.<br><br>
