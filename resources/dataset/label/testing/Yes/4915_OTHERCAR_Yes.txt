After two weeks of researching about digital cameras online, I finally decided to purchase the Sony DSC-P1 Cybershot digital camera.  I had narrowed it down to three cameras, the Canon s-100 (elph), the Sony F505V, and the Canon G1. well as you see i didnt pick either one of those. after handling both canons, they got scratched off my list.  i have used the F505V and was fascinated with the zoom, but it was still a little bulky for me.  then my eyes locked in on the p1...sitting in the showcase. i tried it out and instantly fell in love with the size and picture quality. so far this camera has exceeded my expectations.  i use it just to take pics with friends, family, and trips; so the size comes in handy. once i took the camera out, it was an instant eye catcher...friends and family swarmed around my new camera wanting to touch it, feel it, and perhaps even use it.  in my opinion this is a really good camera. like i said size and picture quality was most important to me, so this met my expectations.  the only bad thing is that there is no case out for it yet, stupid 8 MB memory stick,(i had to spend another $100 for 64MB memory stick), and battery is ok.  So anybody who's looking for a camera for everyday use, should check this camera out. <br><br>
