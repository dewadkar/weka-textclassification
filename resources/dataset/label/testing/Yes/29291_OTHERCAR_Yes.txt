            The Chevrolet Camaro is a very reliable and fun to drive vehicle. I myself have owned three of them, and 2 of its GM counterpart the Firebird. I had much enjoyment driving them and there is nothing about it that I do not like. I have had little or no problems with any of them, and they ran well even for their age and high mileage. My Z-28 had over 165,000 miles on it and it ran like it was new, starting up immediately and never giving me any problems. 

The Camaro is an inexpensive vehicle, that performs very well for it's low cost. It responds quite well to performance modifications and can be made to be a very high performance vehicle easily. I believe that anyone who chooses to buy the Chevrolet Camaro of any year will be quite satisfied with the vehicle and its performance. More so with the Z28 and Iroc-Z models because of the more powerful drive-trains.

I would recommend this car for anyone who has a thirst for performance, but doesn't want to pay a whole lot of money for some high tech car, Those looking for a good reliable car that they can have some fun in,
and those looking to create an extreme high performance vehicle.<br><br>
