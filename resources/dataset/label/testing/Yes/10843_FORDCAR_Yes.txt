            I own a 1998 Ford Windstar GL.  Our old car, a Mercury Sable, was breaking down a lot and just getting too small for our family.  We have 3 kids.  A girl (17), and 2 boys 10 and 13.

The van has been wonderful.  We have 2 captains seats in the front, 2 captains seats in the middle and a bench seat in the far back.
The kids are able to have their own individual seats, so no fights about touching each other.

It's great on long trips, roomy enough for short trips and great when you have field trips for your childrens class.

The only problem is with the door sensor's.  When a door is left open a light on the instrument panel comes on and the interior lights remain on until you are moving about 20 mph.  Even though the doors are all closed, more than once to make sure, the light remains on.  At the end of the day if the interior lights refuse to go off, we pull a fuse, under the steering column, to avoid draining the battery.  This turns the interior lights off, not the instrument panel, and you can't open/close the windows.

We've taken it in and, of course, it wasn't happening when it was there and they couldn't find a problem.  We don't have the time to keep on running back in, so the fuse gets pulled and put back in.
