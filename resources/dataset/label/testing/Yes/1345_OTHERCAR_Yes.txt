            The 1999 Silverado Pickup that I purchased was a V6, 5-Speed, short
bed Silverado with cruise control, chrome package (wheels and grill),
and air conditioning.  It had a discount of $1,000 because of the
V6.  The V6 had plenty of power for the full size pickup and really
saved on gas compared to the larger but more powerful V8.  The 
pewter color with the chrome accents make it one of the best looking
cars on the road.  Price was $16,800 and I purchased it for a 
little less than $15,000.  Anyone who is looking for a great value
in a standard (not loaded to the hilt) pickup should give the 
standard Silverado (base) pickup a try.  If gas mileage is more
important than 0 - 60 mph times then this is the pickup for you.
It still has plenty of power to pull almost any load in the bed
or trailer for that matter and still look good enough to go out on
the town on a Saturday night.<br><br>
