            Wow!  What else is there in a sportscar?  The 1995 Corvette, one of the last C4 models is the Corvette at the best.  Needless to say, the engine produces a whopping 300+ hp.  The huge wheels really bite into the pavement.  It can accelerate as well at 70 or 80 mph as it can starting from a stop.  You'll be amazed at the acceleration that continues well past the 100 mph mark.  Even at top speeds, the Corvette handles brilliantly.  It sticks to the road, even at high speeds, like no other car I've driven (and I've driven a lot!).  The steering is tight, and the suspension is even tighter.  If you've never been in a sportscar, you're going to know what the difference is as soon as you get in.  The cockpit wraps around you, as you almost recline in the wrap-around leather bucket seats.  In the C4 (but not in the C5), the seats have 3 lumbar adjustments, and one adjustment that grabs you around the waist.  You're held snugly in by these great seats, much more than in the newer, C5 models.  
The steering is very tight, as is the clutch.  There's never a question about being in control.  You feel every bump and dip in the road.  On city streets, this can be a real nuisance, as every pothole is magnified ten fold.  But on a country road, or on the highway, you'll appreciate the feedback.  The C5's suspension and steering is not nearly so aggressive.  I drive a six speed standard transmission.  It's not quite a short throw, but the shifting is very crisp.  Of course, with this much power, there's plenty of room to mess up your shifting.  Even a beginner can drive this car.  Shifting from first to fourth is no problem, and the car is virtually impossible to stall.  
Day to day, the car is easy to drive, but hard to get in and out of, as it's so low to the ground.  Also, it tends to develop squeaks and rattles here and there, due to the relatively rough ride.  Because of the massive 5.7 liter engine, and the lack of a standard grille, this car gets HOT.  It's fine if you keep moving, but in stop and go traffic, the engine and even the cockpit can heat up pretty quickly.  
My particular model is the coupe.  Meaning, it's a hard top, but the center roof panel comes off.  It's great when it's off (make sure you crank up that stereo!), and it stores easily on racks built into the &quot;trunk&quot; area, but it's a pain to get on and off.  It's heavy and awkward to move.  Definately a two-person job (you need one person on each side of the car).  It's held on by 4 bolts that you have to get at from inside of the cockpit.  
The standard stereo system is a Bose Gold system.  Plenty loud, plenty clear.  It has a nice feature: speed controlled volume.  Meaning, the faster you go, the louder it gets.  Not available in the C5.  Also, the security is interesting.  All is automatic.  A transmitter on the keychain automatically unlocks and un-arms the security system as you approach the car, and arms and locks, totally hands free, as you walk away.  This is a very solid car, with incredible performance.  On top of that, the many little extras make this a fantastic value for the sports car lover.  Enjoy!<br><br>
