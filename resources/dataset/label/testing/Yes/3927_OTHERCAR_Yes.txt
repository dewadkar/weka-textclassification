            When I started looking for a car I was looking into Jeep Grande Cherokees and other SUVs.  After test driving many different SUVs I decieded that they weren't for me.  I then drove three cars the Plymouth Breeze, Chrysler Cirrus, and the Dodge Stratus.  All three were the same exact car but just by different divisions of the same company.

My family has a long record of buying dodge vehicles.  I don't really know why, most of their dealerships are very customer friendly and they have so many different kinds of cars to fit everyones needs.

When I first got into the Status I thought it was too small (I drove a larger intrepid before).  But now I consider driving an Intrepid like driving a boat!  Stratus' are just the right size and have many wonderful options many other cars don't offer.  It has a fold down back seat for carrying larger items and I like the idea of having a rectractable radio atena.  I don't have to worry about something happening to it while I'm out somewhere.  The auto stick feature can be a really nice feature if you like driving a stick.  I am not one of those people so that option has been pretty much useless to me, but I really like the idea of having it.  

I love my Stratus and I am very happy with it.  When I have to replace this car I think I will defently replace it with another Dodge Stratus or at least with another Dodge vehicle.<br><br>
