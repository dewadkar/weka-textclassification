            I have been a long time Canon SLR camera amateur user and not dare enough (or have the money) to own a digital SLR camera until the 300D came out. 
The 1Ds (or 1Ds) is still too expensive for me. But when the 10D came out, I almost tempted to buy it but still the price held me back.

I used to have to make a choice either to use a film-based SLR camera for a more serious task or just use a point and shoot digital camera for leisurely or travel needs. But now I am using the 300D for almost every occasion and taking it everywhere I go.
I bought the body only kit for about US$820, as I already have several EF lenses.

This camera truly works beyond my expectations, for the features, image quality and ease of use, for the price that I can afford. Its performance is also great, with virtually no lag-time at all between pressing the button and picture taken, unlike a point and shoot digital camera.

The only drawbacks are:
1. My old Canon Speedlite 430EZ external flash does not work with the 300D, I had to buy the new 420EX
2. I have to buy (or invest for) a wider wide angle lenses. The 1.6 conversion ratio (because the300D&#146s CMOS sensor is smaller than 35mm film) makes my 28mm lenses look like a 40mm one. My suggestions: buy the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L USM (if you have the money) or the Sigma AF 17-35mm f/2.8-4 EX HSM for less than half the price of the Canon.

For a killer telephoto, own a Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 EF IS USM. The conversion ratio makes it a 480mm!!!
Also as noted by other reviewers, you must have at least 512MB memory.
Currently I am using Sandisk Ultra II 512MB Compact flash. You&#146ll appreciate the speed (10MB persec read speed) when downloading the pictures to your PC (using a Sandisk Imagemate UBS 2.0 reader). Don&#146t use the camera USB connection, its slow as a snail.

So, for all Canon film-based SLR camera amateur users, this is your time to switch over to digital SLR. You won&#146t regret it.
