            This is a small truck that is useful as day to day transportation as well as occasional hauling.  The extended cab does not add any real extra passenger capacity, but it does make it more roomy for the driver.  The extra inside storage is useful.

The ride is very comfortable for a small truck.  The optional four wheel-drive is very good in snow.  The ABS braking also adds confidence in bad weather.  Traction while in two-wheel mode is marginal in wet weather.

In 38,000 miles this truck has been dependable.  Problem areas included: lower ball joints that needed to be replaced at 30,000 miles, several oil leaks, and a leaking shock absorber.  These were all fixed under warranty.
The serpentine belt needed replacement recently at a cost of $95.  Front brake pads need replacement every 10-12,000 miles.  The dealer has been generally very good about service and warranty work. 

Gas mileage is about 19 mpg locally and up to 22 mpg on long trips. The engine does not use any oil. The original tires will need replacement in about 5,000 miles.
