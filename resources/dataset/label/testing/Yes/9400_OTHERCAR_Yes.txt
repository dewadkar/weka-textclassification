            My first car was a 1981 Buick Century, followed immediately by a dreadful rusted red 1985 Ford Escort.  Tainted by the bad taste of these experiences, and plagued until recently with college student finances, it was with hesitation that I ventured out onto the market for a new car. Volkswagen is looking for drivers, I'd like to drive, why not?  

I walked to the dealership on a sweltering August afternoon, and there were more options than I could take in if given a whole day!  The commercials definitely do the Jetta justice.  I finally settled on the car that was to be henceforth known as Mr. Jetta.  Black finish, heated leather seats, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, alloy wheels, the list goes on.  Love my car!  

I can't imagine not owning a Volkswagen now that I've had this car.  The safety features show the owner that safety comes first with this car.  Dual airbags, side impact airbags, comfortable safety restraints - these are all on the list of why you should buy.  The trunk is enormous.  The back seat folds down entirely, making room for just about anything.  

The car is quiet, solidly corners in immediate turns, and is great on gas.<br><br>
