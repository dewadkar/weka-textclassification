            The Honda CR-V is a comfortable ride for the money.  The car offers a quiet smooth ride and doesn't have the feel of driving a monster truck.  The car interior is set up well.  Stereo and consoles are all in good spots and easy to reach while driving.  The car drives well in bad weather conditions and has plenty of storage room in the back for things that you may be transporting.  

The two downfalls of the car are rather simple.   The first is that the cushioning in the seats can make a long ride sometimes seem longer.  Backseat fits two adults comfortably but three can be a squeeze.  The other problem is the rearview.  High mounted rear lights leave a nasty blind spot when trying to back up or even move toward other lanes.  You really have to make sure a couple of times of exactly what is behind you.

The car is great for anyone that has to endure winter months.  Also good for a small family or I think it's a great single person's car. <br><br>
