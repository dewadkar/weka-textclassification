            November 9th, 1998, 1989 Black Grand Am, meet 1997 White Lincoln Town Car running a stop sign. Ouch!! Glad to be here to tell you about it. I lost that car. My insurance company made me say good-bye to my first car. Well, I was back on the market again folks. My one criteria, I want a stick shift. I found a couple and most were in my price range allowed by insurance company and budget. One of those cars was a 1995 Grand Am. 

My 1989 Grand Am was my first gem. I was 16 and my insurance was about $500 a year-- hey, that's a lot for 16! I had my good student discount but the price of insurance was the same as the boxy 1988 Nissan Sentra I was comparing too. I like the sleek styling of the Grand Am. I love that I have yet to have any major problems between the two of them. I have yet to be nickeled and dimed to death. What I feel I got was a great starter car for a reasonable price. 

I will admit that a Porsche is my dream car, not a Grand Am. But until that point when I have that kind of money (cross my fingers), I am ecstatic for the car I have. The Grand Am will always have a special place in my heart because it was my first, but it also holds a special place in my wallet-- or shall I say it holds other things in my wallet. 

With the stick shift, I get 36 mpg on the interstate. I get a quiet and comfortable ride. I get a car I can recommend to you. It is great for a teenager because insurance is very reasonable. It is great for a small family because it is roomy enough. A car should get you from A to B, and the Grand Am does that, plus makes me feel comfortable with my investment at the same time.
