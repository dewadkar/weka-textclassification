            I sold my Olympus 3000Z to buy this camera mainly for size. This camera fits my shirt pocket nicely. I did a lot of research on similar cameras such as Canon S10, S20 but finally chose 4700. Here�s why:  in general camera with smaller lens get less light and hence less picture quality. The Cannon S20 I borrowed from a friend is very cute but picture quality suffered greatly esp on the night shots where the tiny flash didn�t deliver enough light. On the other hand cameras such as Olympus 3000Z (and newer crops such as 3040, 4040) offer excellent picture but too bulky for me.
One thing I want to make clear: many ads esp ones on ebay falsely claimed this camera had 4.3 megapixels. In reality it has only 2.5 megapixels and the 4.3 megapixels comes from with Fuji�s �Supper CCD� technology. After reading about this �Supper CCD� and compared picture quality with other cameras esp with Olympus C3000Z that I previously had, I conclude that the Fuji 4700 should be in the 2.5 megapixels category, NOT in 4.3 megapixels category although 4.3 does help in printing(see below).
Here�re what I like:
- Compact size: this is the main reason why I buy this camera. It has a sleek all-metal body that fits shirt pocket
- Picture quality: above average. I don�t expect excellent pictures out of this camera so I�m happy with above average picture. On a  sunny day pictures are excellent, more than I expect, however indoor pictures are somewhat reddish 
- Pop-up flash: one of the problems that plagued small camera is red-eyes. Because of the size there is no space to place the flash farther away from the lens and hence the red-eye problem. (expensive cameras such as Nikon 950 is among the worst). Fuji 4700 fixes this problem by having a pop-up flash, which greatly reduce  red-eyes problem.
- Lens cap: built-in lens cap is great. I�m, allergic to dangling lens cap
- Rechargeable batteries and charger: 2 Ni-Mh AA-size batteries and a  charger are included. Although the charger is slow I think it�s OK since the camera uses only 2 batteries. Also good is that in case you�re short of batteries you can always run to a shop next door to buy 2 AA batteries, unlike some proprietary batteries, you�re in dead end if you run of out juice.
- Options for different picture conditions: besides the main �Auto� mode you can select different picture mode such as portrait, landscape etc...and the camera change the default values to suit the mode. For example it �Portrait� mode is selected, the camera will adjust the lens and speed condition so that the picture will be softer.
- Compatibility with 128M SmartMedia. Many cameras can only be compatible with 64M Smartmedia card. 
- Printing: I think this is the strong point of the 4700. The extra pixels from the �Supper CCD� technology really help the printed media. I�m still using my old Epson 750 for printing and the results are great esp with 8x10. The highest resolution seems to help a lot on printing. Although the color tone and the sharpness are not as good as  Olympus 3000Z, the 8x10 picture is much better due to higher resolution.
What I don�t like:
- Optical view finder. Shows only about 75% of the image. So you don�t get what you see. However, to be fair all other cameras are the same (compared to Olympus C3000Z I think the 4700 is even better)
- Blurry pictures: I don�t know this is a problem with small cameras or it�s just Fuji�s but Fuji 4700 has the same problem as the previous 1700: if you don�t take the picture carefully, esp at night, the pix is out of focus and hence blurry.
- No case: I think Fuji should include a case rather than selling it as accessory for $20 (buy from ebay it costs only $13 - $14).  
- No attachment for external flash:  if you take a lot of indoor pix and want to attach an external flash, you�re stuck.
Other remarks:
- Night shots are average but better than I expected, however I had to use  "Night Mode" for best results. Beware that this mode also has side effects: moving objects will be blurres as the camera is set to use longer exposure to take better picture in the dark
- How about Finepix 4800?: identical to 4700 plus some extras such as a caddle where you can place the camera to unload pictures to the computer via USB, and to work as a InternetVideo Camera. I would have bought 4800 if I have extra money
Conclusion: 
This is a good camera that produces high resolution, good color, and good light sensitivity in a small box, ie an excellent compromise of quality and size. Should everyone rush out and buy it.  No, it depends. If you are a �semi-pro� who would die for picture quality and willing to spend time to tweak manual controls don�t buy this one, go for bigger cameras such as : 3040Z, 950, 990, Powershot G10 or even 4040Z etc... However if you want a compact camera that won't get left in the drawer and at the same time deliver the quality nearly as good as the bigger ones the 4700 is the best in my opinion. Oh, BTY if you want the smallest possible size and don�t care about quality go for Canon S20.
