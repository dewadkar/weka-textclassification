            Staples decided to launch Windows XP with a promotion that let me get a full rebate on this camera, plus a memory card for it, plus some useless software.  Well, this was too tempting to pass up so I bit...

And it's been a great camera so far!  You can't even compare a film camera to the level of convenience this gives!  You can take as many photos as you want and never waste a single shot of film, you can review the photos on the spot, delete the photos that don't meet what you want, and even take hundreds of lower resolution snapshots.

This camera has a 2X Digital Zoom, which basically crops out the middle of a 1280x960 photo and downsizes to 640x480...utterly useless if you have a good photo editing program...and since it comes with Adobe PhotoDeluxe you should have no problem.  You can just blow it up yourself and take the higher rez pictures.  Unless you just want to save space on the memory disk.

The camera is packaged with an 8 MegaByte Smartmedia card.  This tiny little card can hold approximately 14 or so of the highest quality pictures and gads of the lower quality ones(I'd estimate well over 60, and I do mean well over!).  Luckily my nice little package also came with a 32MegaByte card(not included with the camera, this was just part of the Staples promotion).  So I put this card in and boom, I could take hundreds of the 640x480 resolution pictures!

Best thing is, since it doesn't use film you become creatively free because you don't have to worry about wasting film on "stupid" pictures.  This is awesome because you take pictures of people just being people, instead of people posing for your pictures like with most film cameras.  You can end up with the most interesting pictures ever with this little thing!

To transfer over to your computer you just plug in the USB cord and install the software and you're good to go.  My printer(HP Photosmart 1000) has a SmartMedia slot so I can print directly off of the card onto the printer even if my PC is off or busy.  Handy feature I finally get to use!(have had the printer longer than the camera and no use for the slot).

Now for the less great aspects of the camera.  It's 1.3MegaPixel which although being great for simple shots, isn't really enough if you want to print nice big blowups or do really good portrait pictures.  Also, being focus free leads to a lot of objects not being as sharp as I'd like them to be.  The sweet spot for this lens seems to begin at about 5-10 feet away and extend for a bit.  Everything there is very much in focus, and the other objects less so.

Also, I feel that the flash is tuned a little strange in automatic mode...sometimes it uses it when it really shouldn't.  Luckily you can over ride this with so many options you can have a field day just taking test shots to see what everything looks like.  Best of all, you don't waste any film!

Finally, you should definitely invest in some NiMH rechargable batteries and a good charger.  This should run you another 20-30 dollars unless you can find a good sale(try target or kmart, they often have sales on these plus rebates every now and then).  That way you won't shell out huge amounts of money for Alkaline batteries.  This thing eats batteries badly when the flash is on.  It behaves MUCH better when using alkalines and the flash is off though so if you only take outdoor pictures, you can probably deal with it.  Then again Target and Kmart had some interesting alkaline battery deals before...(almost free...) so if you have the chance it might be worth it for you.  It all depends on how you use it, but I think in the long run it's still better to get the NiMH batteries.  They last longer too so you won't have to swap out as often.

It's a great little camera though, just don't expect professional level results and you'll love it!
By the way the price I cite is for the package with the memory card.  The Camera itself was only $150.  Tax not counted here.  Also battery life is based on Alkaline batteries.  If you are running NiMH batteries upgrade that number to average or even good if you don't use the flash...

UPDATE:
Well I'd like to add 2 things about this camera.  First off, there isn't a lens cap for the lens area that would cover the glass there.  I dropped this camera onto the floor but the glass over the lens area seems tougher than I'd thought.  No scratches so far...  Only thing is, the lens fell out of focus after I dropped it!  I tried switching between the normal lens and the macro lens hoping it'd get back into place with no avail.  I was all ready to call up Fuji for the warranty when I decided to give it a good smack to get the lens back into place.  Anyway, it worked so that's that.  Still, I have doubts about it's reliability so don't drop it :)
