            The new 2001 Acura CL Type-S is exactly what I was looking for in a car.  For a while, I had my mind set on a 3-series BMW, but as soon as I test drove a new Type-S I was sold.  It has all the luxuries of a Euro coupe, and in fact, most of those luxuries come standard.  For example, the HID headlights, perforated leather, 6-disc in dash Bose stereo, 17&quot; high performance tires, and heated seats are standard...these options would have been thousands of dollars extra in a BMW or Audi.  

But the real reason I chose the Acura CL Type-S over a European coupe is the 260hp 3.2 litre engine, which rockets the car 0-60 in 6.4 seconds.  With this car you can beat the 328 or A4 off the line.  This power coupled with the lush interior make the driving experience complete.

The option I did chose to get, and the only major option available (everything else comes standard), was the Acura Navigation System.  This option adds $2000 to the sticker, but if you travel a lot, it is well worth the price.  You'll never get lost again.

My only minor complaint is there is no all-disc shuffle in the stereo.  One would think that this detail would not have been overlooked in a Bose system.

I would recommend this car to anyone, especially someone who is a young professional with no children.  It is probably not a 'family' car, as it only seats 4 and the back seat is quite small.  The trunk in rather large though.  If you pick up a new CL Type-S, you will definitely enjoy.
