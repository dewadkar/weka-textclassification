            I had an opportunity, recently to sample the new for 2001 Toyota RAV4 while helping a friend with her car purchase. The RAV was introduced several years ago and though it has sold in modest numbers in this new, but already saturated market; it appears to have developed quite a loyal following. 2001 reflects a whole new RAV, and alot of the problems with the first model seem to have been addressed (odd styling, engine groan, higher load floor, poor dash design) . I really like this vehicle on the whole. Though variable valve timed, small displacement engines (VVTi) have difficulty mustering low end torque (the RAV is no different) - I was generally impressed with the peppy engine performance. It is sharp looking, and interior ergonomics are near ideal. Textures feel high quality, and loading the cargo bay is a breeze with such a clever rear door design and low load floor. Ingress and egress are satisfactory and with terrific approach and departure angles from the bumpers, curbs or even light off roading is a breeze. I test drove many in this class with my friend in tow, and it's combination of functionality, style, and quality could not be beat. The last positive comment, however has become questionable of late. My friend's 01 model RAV has demonstrated build quality problem from the start. What's worse, Toyota seems to be acknowledging the problems 'officially' only after much nagging on the part of my friend. She has experienced paint performance problems, interior fit and trim difficulties, and a repetitive wind noise problem from the base of the windshield. Also, the decal trim around the front door frame is bubbling.  The very worst problem of all is a bad creak in the rear suspension that seems to occur only when the fuel cell is less than 1/4 full. Toyota refuses to acknowledge that the rear bushings are bad even though we know that is the problem. I have been disappointed by the vehicles initial build quality problems, especially from a company renownd for quality products. I am fully aware of the millions of loyal and continually satisfied Toyota owners out there (I spoke with many of them when helping my friend with her research). That said, the only explanation that I can fathom is that these are simply early build problems from a totally new vehicle, and that Toyota will eventually solve them.
