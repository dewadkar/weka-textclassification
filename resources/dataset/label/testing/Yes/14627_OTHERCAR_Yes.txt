            less engine options than earlier models, revised headlights and a pointy butt are the exterior changes.

i am used to driving a big powerful cadillac and it was a trip getting used to the difference of a compact car. (i love how tight this little thing corners though!!) of course it is smaller, isnt lined with velvet, and the eingine is half the size of my old deville but I love this car! As with most compact cars, the resale value isn't a reason to purchase this vehicle, especially with the way GM is rebating things. (why purchase a used car when you can get a new one rebated for only a couple $k more?) Also the ABS is no longer standard as of 2003. However you do get front and side air bags for both driver and passenger and an otherwise revised braking system. 
If you want something that will make you say *WOOHOO!!* for around $14-18k then go for it!!! The Sun and Sound package boasts an externally sliding sunroof that looks like a little airfoil when opened, and wicked 8 speaker Monsoon -and boy they aren't kidding- sound. (that's a lot of speakers for a little car!) GM is also offering rebates right now and i got my sunfire LOADED for about $13.5k. I went ahead and purchased a lot of extended warranties and insurance-type things that bumped the price up by a couple thousand dollars but all of those things were completely optional. The folding rear seats do a 60/40 split so you can strap in your buddy (there are three 3-pt seatbelts in the back seat) and have room to stuff a manatee in thru the <i>surprisingly</i> big trunk. The transmission is by the same people who make transmissions for Porsche, which makes for an eager little four cyl car. Pontiac has phased out all trim options for the Sunfire except the 2.2L 140hp coupe. This is still plenty of power unless you're seriously street racing, and Civics and Proteges eat my dust all the time, easy cheesey pumpkin pie. The dual exhaust system also lends a brutish little note to the engine, which makes it sound more like a big bruiser car than the runt of the Pontiac litter. The gas mileage is only average for compact cars- 26 for city and up to 35 for highway. i was thrilled with this though after driving my big 1988 deville that got 20mpg on the freeway going downhill on cruise control ;)

consumer reports isnt usually kind to GM cars but everybody i've met who has a sunfire deems it a pleasure to drive and an all around robust little car. it is *not* a bmw, it is *not* a ferarri. it's a darn great little compact car for the money as compared to all the other little compact cars.

If you want a car that saves you fifteen bucks a month on gas, looks like something Aunt Bea would drive, and doesn't come standard with *floormats* then get yourself a Civic or a Corolla.(both excellent cars dont get me wrong!) The Sunfire will give you a good 100k miles of loyal service if you keep up with maintenance, just like pretty much any new car, and it will be WAY MORE FUN, LOOK WAY SEXIER doin it and <b>LOVE</b> to do it for ya!!!!!!

<b>UPDATE</b>
howdy! i have driven my 03 sunfire from new york to texas to indiana and back.. and to california and back twice. i put a little over 35k miles on it since january without any problems whatsoever. (the seats turned out to be very comfortable and supportive on long trips.) The car was fabulous. last wednesday however a lady tboned me doing 45 and totaled it. they had to pry me out with bars but i managed to escape with only a couple bruises. this little car was a joy to drive, sturdy as hell with absolutely no problems after 35k miles of lead footed college student driving in less than 8 months, and has proven itself in terms of safety. my little blue car got absolutely demolished  by an acura and still managed to protect me from harm. as soon as all the red tape with insurance (boy was i glad i got GAP COVERAGE)  clears, you can bet i will be climbing into another 03 sunfire.
