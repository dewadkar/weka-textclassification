            I recently purchased a 67 vette hard top, the least made vette around.  I was amazed at all the power this fabulous car has, while having superior comfort for me to drive my family around in.  I purchased a stick shift, which I would recommend for anyone.  This is by far my favorite car I've ever bought, and, in my opinion the best car in the world, I would recommend this car to anyone who has the money, mainly because there were only 500 made back in 1967.  The only slight problem with this car is the cost, it ran me 50,000 for a used car, which is really expensive, but it was definately worth it.  This car handles great, with lots of power, making it a perfect car for someone like me.<br><br>
