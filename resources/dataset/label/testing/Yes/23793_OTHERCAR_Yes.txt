            My son needed a car that was reliable.  We went together looking for a really cheap new car, and gave the Metro a test drive.  With it's tinny doors, hard to read gauges, poor acceleration and tiny back seat, it was a loser.  When we tried the Echo it was a wonderful contrast.  First he drove it and then I took the wheel.  Maybe trying the Metro first, made it seem even better, but it looked so good, I helped him with the down payment and he bought it.

He chose a four-door, manual transmission with air conditioning and a cheap radio.  Those choices kept the cost down.  The general appearance of the car is okay.  It's small and trim but not a great looking car.

The gauges are placed in the center of the dash where the steering wheel doesn't hide them and they are easy to see.  The controls are in reasonable places, the turn signal returns to the normal position after it does its job and it gets great gas mileage.  The upright seats are comfortable and similar in position to ones in a SUV.  You get a good look at the traffic ahead from this straight seating.  

The acceleration is fine.  It won't beat a Corvette, but it moves quickly enough for a car of its class.  It handles well also.  And it gets great gas mileage.  

The back seat can be used by small to average sized persons.  Someone with really long legs would be uncomfortable in the back.  The doors close with a satisfyingly solid sound. 

One of the best things about it is the quiet ride.  Your conversations can be carried on without competing with engine noises.  That was a real surprise.

When we picked up the car everything on it worked.  There were no surprises.  Since he wanted the stripped down car, it had to be located and driven to the dealer.  There were no scratches or rough spots that I could see.  

In short, for the bottom of the line cost, I think I picked a winner. <br><br>
