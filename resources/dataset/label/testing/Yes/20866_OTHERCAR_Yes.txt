            I recently had the chance to ride as a passenger in the PT Cruiser. The car is very attractive inside and out.  

The outside as you can see in the picture is very stylish and does turn heads.  I was driving through a college campus in the vehicle and I must say many people where looking.  I like the chrome aluminum wheels on this vehicle I think they blend in well with the body of the car.

The inside of the car is a decent size.  The back is tight, fits about to normal sized adults comfortably but that's all I would recommend.  The seats are removable which I found to be interesting.  That way if you want to carry cargo for a trip you can load more.  The seats are leather and I found them to be relatively comfortable and nice looking.

As far as driving the car myself I wasn't able to.  It sounded like it ran smooth but we drove around for around a half hour not going over 45mph.  My friend said the car has ran smooth since he had it with decent power.  He was happy with the car he said but he talked about the looks of the car virtually the entire time, and not the performance.

Overall, if your looking for a stylish car at a relatively low price this is the car for you.  This car is new to the markets so you may want to hold out on your purchase of this car so they can keep perfecting it.  Such as anything new put out on the markets the PT Curser im sure will have some drawl backs in the proper production of the vehicle in the next few years.<br><br>
