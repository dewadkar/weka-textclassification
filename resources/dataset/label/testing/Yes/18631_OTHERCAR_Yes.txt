            I was recently in the market for a new car.  Being a previous General Motors owner, I was looking at new GM cars.  When I test drove the Alero, I fell in love.  The car handles well, and it's instrumentation was well placed.  The only thing I do not love about my car is it's less than spacious interior storage space.  But that is a small complaint.  This car is reasonably priced and is a great handling car.  I love it.<br><br>
