            I bought this '96 G20 in 1996.  At the time I was told that it was to be the last of the G20s.  I ordered a standard transmission.  The car has a CD with an outstanding sound system and a super AC system.  

I have owned sports cars, large convertibles, wagons and vans.  I traded a V8 TBird for the G20 and have never looked back.  This little car is without a doubt the best automobile that I have ever owned.  I am 58 years old and have had over 40 cars.  The only car that has ever come close to the quality, fit,finish, and fun driving factor is the last Beetle that I owned, a '74 SuperBug.
  
This car handles like a sports car and will leave many sportier cars behind at the light.  I recently had an opportunity to drive one of the new G20s and frankly was a little disappointed.  The new G20 did not seem to have the guts nor did it seem to handle as well as the '96.  In all fairness the new G20 did have an automatic tranny.
  
In retrospect the only thing that I would have done differently during the initial ordering process would have been to spring for the G20T with a combo CD/Tape radio.  The car has 35000 miles on it and is still like new. 
 
The only thing that has ever gone wrong with the car was a burned out headlight bulb. The dealer replaced the bulb under warranty in about 5 minutes while I waited.  
Looking for a really good used car?  Find yourself a '96 G20.<br><br>
