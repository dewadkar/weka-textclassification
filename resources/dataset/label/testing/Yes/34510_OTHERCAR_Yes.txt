            I bought my Pontiac Sunfire back in March of 99 when i moved and needed a car of my own. I shopped it around of course till i found the perfect one which had all the things on it i wanted. It's the SE but came with the bigger engine which is actually in the GT model. I think for the price i got it for and for my use it is the perfect car. 

A few downfalls of the car are  the cup holders suck in the car. The one in the front seat isn't deep enough so if i have a drink in it and i'm not careful the drink will tip over because it doesn't fit in it well. There 
are 2 cup holders in the back seat but they don't seem to hold drinks very well in it either. Another thing that is annoying is that the driver's seat has a lumbar support in it that is supposed to make the seat more comfortable but it actually makes it harder on the back. I think the passenger seat is more comfortable than the driver's seat. 

What i do like about this car is even though the car itself is small it does have some good amount of space in it in terms of the trunk...the back seat folds down to make more room for bigger things if i need to transport big things in my car. Another cool thing is the glove compartment is HUGE. It is bigger than any glove compartment i've seen on bigger cars i've been in. Only one bad thing about it is there is no lights in the glove compartment like there is in, in most glove compartments. 
Another good thing is that for the size of the car it sure does have good power and can definitely &quot;get out of it's own way&quot;.  
All in all i think the car is good for the money. I had also test drove the chevy cavalier when car shopping and i definitely think the sunfire is the better car and give a better ride and is more comfortable to ride in.<br><br>
