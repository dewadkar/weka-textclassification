            I bought a 98 Dodge neon when I graduated High School, and it is a very nice car. It is sporty while at the same time, roomy inside. Although, if you have more than 2 children, you wouldn't want this car. My two fit in the back perfectly. It is good on gas, doesnt really take much to get far. This is the type car that people with 2 or less kids should have, it is not intended to really be a family vehicle. This car is very easy to drive. It is small but has a whole lot of power!! I was surprised the first time that I drove it. It has alot more power than alot of sporty cars. I love the stereo system in this car...it is nice and has good volume and bass. It has a cassette player and a.m./f.m. stereo....just right for most people. So if you are looking into buying a car, I suggest that you go to a Dodge dealer and look at this car!<br><br>
