            The Olympus C2040 is a great digital camera for beginners and advanced users alike. The camera's controls are fairly straightforward and easy to use. The LCD screen is a good size although it is a little difficult to see in bright sunlight. The image quality from this camera is excellent. It performs very well in low light also. Overall a great feature set and performance combination.

This is my second digital camera, prior to this I had the Fuji MX-600 which was also a great camera and is still performing well for my mother-in-law. I wanted something with a higher resolution capability and decided on the Olympus 2040. I did quite a bit of research before deciding to purchase it. Some of my reasons for deciding on this model: the lens quality, the use of regular AA batteries, the Olympus reputation for quality and the generally very good reviews. My efforts have been well rewarded and I have enjoyed using this camera for well over a year now.

Setting up the camera for use is easy. Insert the 4 AA size batteries and the supplied 8mb memory card and you are ready to take pictures. The basic controls are also fairly simple to use. The control knob on top allows you to select the shooting or playback mode, either fully automatic program or you can choose to control the exposure manually or with you selecting the aperture or shutter and the camera setting the corresponding value. The zoom control for the lens is right next to the control knob and easy to use while framing your shots through the viewfinder or using the LCD screen. The LCD screen gives you a very accurate depiction of what your final image will look like and the brightness is adjustable through the menu system on the display. However, even when you tweak out the LCD it is still quite difficult to see in bright sunlight. Buttons to control the flash and the macro mode are on the back and are fairly self explanatory. All of the modes and settings are displayed on the LCD screen and the display on top of the camera so you do not have to have the screen on to see what settings you have set. The menu system on the display is somewhat complex and too extensive to go into. The main things to note are that you can control the image quality, camera setup, exposure and special effects as well as a few other options. Some of the effect include a black and white setting as well as a solarized look. You will definitely need to spend a little time with the instruction manual to get the hang of the menu system. The instructions that came with the camera are quite extensive and written pretty well so that should not be a problem.

Flash photography is also pretty easy to master with the 2040. The flash exposure is pretty accurate for the most part. The redeye reduction is the old style preflash so you do have to let people who you are photographing that there will be a flash before the picture is taken. This can be annoying but does actually do a better job then the now popular bright red light. Besides, it is easy enough to use software to take out the redeye after the fact. The only thing that can be a little tricky is using the flash close up. It does tend to overexpose a bit up close and using a little exposure compensation can really help this. The camera has one interesting quirk in this regard as well. If you have the macro mode turned  on and use the flash there is a short delay after pressing the shutter button before the picture is actually taken. Once you know this trick it is no big deal. Low light shooting without the flash is also a no-brainer. The camera�s auto white balancing does an excellent job and the photos are pretty decent even in fairly low light.

I can not say enough good things about the image quality from this camera. Even in the medium quality mode it allows me to print a very respectable 8x10 with my HP printer. With the quality mode turned to medium I get approximately 120 images on a 64 meg card. In the super high quality mode I get about half of that. I don�t usually use the TIFF mode so I am not sure what the results would be. I also don�t usually try to transfer the images directly to my computer from the camera so I am not sure exactly what problems there might be with that process. I just put my smart media card in a card reader to download the pictures to my hard drive. I recently purchased a Sony DSC-P71 3 megapixel camera thinking I wanted something a little smaller. I was so disappointed in the image quality from the Sony, particularly in low light and with the flash,  that I returned it after just a couple of uses. I will review my experiences with the Sony in the near future so keep an eye out if you are interested.
