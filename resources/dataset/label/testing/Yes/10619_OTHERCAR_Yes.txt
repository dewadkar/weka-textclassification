            My partner and I have been in the San Francisco area for a little over a year.  We came with one car.  Luckily, we both work at the same place, but the one-car thing has gotten old, so on a whim I decided to get him a new car for his birthday.  But it had to be cheap.  NICE, and cheap!  We had noticed a few Daewoos on the road and they were attractive.  We also drive by a Daewoo dealership every day.  I know the brand is new on the market and I hit Ford and Chrysler, but he wanted to look at a Leganza, and we went home with one after the first test drive.


Price was the &quot;catch,&quot; but in spite of some negative response of what a couple of major publications had to say, we have been easily hooked.  For our $18,400 we got a fully loaded CDX.  The exterior fit and finish is as good as anything else we looked at.  The car has a lot of pep in a four cylinder motor (much more than adequate, in our opinion) and the car turns on a dime.  As much as I love my 1997 Ford Taurus, the Leganza has a little panache, and that makes it kind of fun! Now we haven't had it very long.  As far as I am concerned the ride, handling, noise level, seat comfort (even in the rear, and I am 6'4&quot;), and general operation of the vehicle are great.  I wish the top-of-the line CDX offered a 5-speed, but the 4-speed automatic tranny on ours is fine.  The trunk is spacious, and the rear seats fold down for added space.


I agree with others that the leather used in the interior isn't fabulous, but at this price who can complain.  The interior fit and finish is as good as the exterior.  The sound system and the automatic climate control systems are great, and the computer age readouts are a lot of fun.  However, the company could rethink the radio and climate controls to make them easier to use, and I prefer my Taurus' cruise control buttons on the steering wheel.  However, these are minor complaints and the company can correct these things in the future.  I really like the car and I hope they (Daewoo) make a go of it.  The jury is out I guess as to reliability, but I am very confident at this point, and the excellent warranty gives added security.  Try it, you will like it! <br><br>
