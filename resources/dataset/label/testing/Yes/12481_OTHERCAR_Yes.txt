            I've had my car about a week and love it. I got one in midnight with the upgraded stereo and weather package.  My only complaint is once you add a few option packages you might as well had gotten a base S70.  It adds up quick, but the car itself is a dream.  Smooth ride, nice acceleration, and it's not common like the Accord, Camry, or Maxima.  Like the fact that few people have one yet.  The stereo system doesn't have enough thump for me so if I had to do it again I'd get the base system and upgrade it myself later.  Lots of little extras.  I expect maintenance to be low since oil gets changed every 7,500 miles (salesman recommended changing between 4-5k to break in engine) and timing belt at 107,000.  Very glad I purchased the car.<br><br>
