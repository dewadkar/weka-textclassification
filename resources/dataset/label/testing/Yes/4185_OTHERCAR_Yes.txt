            I am driving my first mini van, and I love it.

I bought my white 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan ES used with 69,000 miles on it.  First off I love the ES package. It has a CD player, power locks and windows, tinted windows, electric seats and I don't know that proper term for it, but it is an overhead system that tells me several things.  It has the temperature outside, the direction I am driving, how many miles till my gas tank is empty and when I go on trips I can set it to time my trip from start to finish.

I love the way the caravan drives.  I was afraid I would feel like I was in a bus, but I don't. It is very smooth.  I have the 3.0, V-6 engine which has great take off.  I love to be at a stoplight and be the first one out when the light turns green.  Especially when I am sitting next to a sportier vehicle, I think it is great!!  For traveling and highway driving, it is a very comfortable drive and I feel in control even at speeds I shouldn't be driving...don't worry I don't get to 100!!
It does have cruise control which is also nice.

I have captains chairs in the middle which is nice because it keeps my boys from aggravating each other all the time.  The back seat does come out but it is extremely heavy and I can't do it by myself.  My husband has to take it out, or I need a friend to help get it out.

There are more cup holders than I imagine anyone could use, but they are all in handy spots, and they do more than just hold drinks.  I can also put my son in the back on a road trip and put his crayons in a cup and it holds his art supplies.

Another handy feature is the extra plug in the rear.  It is like a cigarette lighter.  I use it to plug in a car vacuum to clean out my van, but it could also be used with any TV that has a plug like that, a cell phone or a bottle warmer.

I have the dual climate control which is another great feature since I am always cold and every one else is not!!

The only thing about my van that makes me uneasy or that I don't like is it is very squeaky in the front suspension.  I was sure that it was a problem with my van, but I have a friend who drives a Ford Windstar and hers does the same thing.  So I like to think it is just a &quot;minivan&quot; thing.<br><br>
