            After driving the Jag S-Type, which shares a chassis and powertrains, I have made two updates.  These are noted at the beginning of the paragraphs with &quot;Update:&quot;

This is the most serious attempt yet at a high performance luxury sedan by an American automaker.  The Lincoln LS was designed to be a driver's car, and succeeds.  Yet it is not a car for everyone.  Some of the design choices made will rule the LS out for many mainstream luxury buyers.

I do not own this car.  Instead, I test drove one while helping my aunt look for a new car.  That day we drove this car and the Toyota Avalon (see separate review).  Though similar in exterior size and price, the two cars could not be more different.

Though I would personally prefer the eight, I was thinking about my aunt's needs at the time so we drove the six with an automatic.  Though the acceleration of this engine would be adequate for the mainstream buyer, the rest of the car would not be, so this engine does not make a lot of sense here.  Well, I guess BMW sells 528's, and Lexus sells GS300's, so there very well may be a market for a tight sports sedan with marginally decent acceleration.  I'd personally try to find a way to dig up the extra cash for the eight.  I have no doubts that acceleration with that engine would be very satisfying.

Update: I have now driven the Jag with the eight, and it moves the car nicely.  Though not the quickest eight out there, it is quick enough for all but the most power-hungry drivers.

The five speed automatic shifts very smoothly.  Aside from power, the only other complaint I had about this powertrain was that at highway speeds the exhaust droned a bit.  It was not loud enough to be disturbing, but it was always there, and it was not a pleasant sound.
I wonder if the Jag S-Type (same body structure, same engine tuned for more power) makes the same sound.  It would be very out of character for a Jag.  But then I guess it's quite unusual for a Lincoln as well. Hopefully the eight doesn't suffer from a similar problem.

I own a Ford Contour(see separate review), and from my experience with that car knew that Ford (or at least Ford of Europe) could really design a fine chassis.  I'd been looking forward to driving an LS to see what the people who designed my car could do given free reign with a rear-wheel-drive chassis.

I was not disappointed.  Handling is clearly the forte of the LS.  The body structure is very tight and solid.  You feel this solidity in every move the car makes.  In this way the LS is much like the big buck German competition.  The LS turns in quickly and confidently.  The chassis always feels balanced.

Traditionally when American automakers have set out to provide a luxury car with a handling suspension they have destroyed the ride.  This was especially the case in the '80's and early '90's, when Cadillacs with handling packages rode like the trucks of the era.  (My grandfather for some reason unknown to me bought a '90 Seville with the handling package.  He has regretted this ever since.)

Thankfully this is not the case with the LS.  While the ride is firm--you won't confuse it with a Lexus--it is never harsh.  The suspension is very well damped (as opposed to stiffly sprung).  While you will hear the bumps in the road a bit, the suspension always seems to handle them is a very controlled manner.  Combined with the handling, this is very confidence-inspiring.

Moving inside the car, Lincoln has done a good but not outstanding job.  The driving position is very good, not too low or too high, and the seat is supportive and comfortable.  It is firmer than typical American luxury cars, but not as firm as the seat in a BMW.

Update: The surfaces on the dash and especially on the center console are a hard, flat plastic with severe edges.  The aesthetic is basically BMW.  Like a BMW, it generally fails to appear luxurious.  This was especially noticeable after driving the Jag.  Although the Ford and Jag use the same audio and HVAC units in the dash, they feel very different inside.  The Jag is $10k more.  I think I know where Ford saved most of that money.

The big problem with the interior is space, though not so much actual space as perceived space.  Given a certain amount of space, a car's designers can do various things to make it feel larger or smaller than it actually is.  Toyota went in the spacious direction in a big way with the Avalon.  Lincoln went nearly as far in the other direction with this car.  While no average-sized person is likely to actually be physically cramped front or rear in this car, they may feel cramped, especially in the front.  

The biggest problem is the A-pillar (the pillar next to the windshield).  This pillar is raked quite far back and low, such that it ends up very close to the driver's face.  This makes the exterior look sleeker, but it also makes the interior feel much smaller than it actually is.  I personally prefer designs that keep the A-pillars and windshield header out of my immediate vision, and suspect many people feel the same way.  This is a rare problem to have in a sedan, especially in this class.  German luxury sedans in particular tend to have much more upright windshields.  In the past I've most commonly found this to be a problem in sports coupes like the Eclipse and Camaro.

The door panels are similarly designed so they are close.  There is actually very little room to reach the seat controls between the seat and the door.  I personally like an interior that is somewhat close to the driver because it feels sportier.  In the LS, however, Lincoln has gone too far in this direction.

Taken together, these design features make the LS feel like a compact.  My aunt kept referring to it as a &quot;nice little car.&quot;  Her current car is a Camry, which is nearly half a foot shorter and more than a quarter ton lighter, but to her this car seems smaller.  For this reason it did not come close to meeting her needs.  Granted, she really is not the intended market.  But I suspect that the intended market would also like a somewhat airier cabin.  

Lincoln advertises how this car is roomier than the competition.  What they must remember is that numbers are not what matters in the end.  Perceptions are.

Storage also suffers from the way the interior has been designed. The glove box and center console are shockingly small.  The latter is nearly filled by the optional CD changer.  There is just enough room in the interior to hold four or five card-deck-sized objects, as long as you don't want to store two in the same place.

The most controversial part of the LS may be the styling, because it tries so hard to be noncontroversial.  Both the exterior and the interior are overly conventional in appearance.  While few people will think either is ugly, they won't be at the top of anyone's list either.  Given the success of Lexus, I can see why Lincoln felt that safe was the way to go.  

Kind of like the &quot;name,&quot; which is shared with at least two other cars.  Alphanumeric &quot;names&quot; are having a revival again (the first time was back in the '80's, when Pontiac gave them a try).  Cadillac is considering going alphanumeric as well.  This saddens me.  Alphanumerics are so boring.  Lincoln and Cadillac no doubt feel alphanumeric is the way to go because that's what Mercedes, BMW, and Lexus do.  And because real names are risky.  They actually mean something to people, so some people will not like any name you come up with.  In contrast, alphanumeric names are just there, you can't really like them or hate them.  Still, Lincoln and Cadillac should be warned.  Acura abandoned a great name, &quot;Legend,&quot; to go the alphanumeric route--perhaps because they got burned so badly with &quot;Vigor.&quot;  But renaming the Legend the RL has all but killed it.  Acura seems to be having second thoughts with renaming the Integra.  Lincoln, and Cadillac, should keep this in mind.

Back to the styling: Critics have been especially unkind towards the rear end.  But BMW sedans have nearly the same taillamp design (no doubt this is where Ford got it), and I can't remember that they've never been picked on for it.  That said, the rear is also my least favorite part of the car.  Some people have been critical of the large amounts of chrome on the grille and around the rear license plate, but I think they are at least as tasteful as the signature details of other premium brands.  They're simply not as familiar yet.

The nicest thing about the appearance of the LS may be its basic proportions.  The front overhang is short and together with the broad stance and clean, horizontal lines give the car a very efficient, purposeful character.  I have always been a fan on nice proportions in cars.  The last Acura Legend had similar proportions, and I liked them as well.  If that car is any guide, however, good proportions are lost on 99% of the market.  Give them well proportioned clean lines and they simply see a plain car.

The next best thing about the LS after the handling is the price.  No one else offers this level of automobile at this low of a price.  Even the eight, the one I would buy, can be had for well under $40k.  Comparable cars from Mercedes (E430) and BMW (540i) are over $50k, and the Lexus GS400 comes close to that number.  For $10k it might be worth learning to live with the A-pillar.

In conclusion, the LS is a bargain for those who truly desire a high performance luxury sedan, not just the image of one.  Those who expect their luxury sedans to feel spacious, however, should look elsewhere.<br><br>
