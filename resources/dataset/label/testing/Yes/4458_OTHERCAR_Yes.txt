            The new cabrio is an awesome car with many good features.  It is a very safe car and having the convertuble top just makes the car a hundred times better.  This is a &quot;girls&quot; car, any age it doesnt matter.  The option of having leather seats that warm up in the winter is awesome.  I bought the car because it was a reasonable car and the color of it is awesome (desert wind).A great six disc compact disc player comes in the trunk for easy listening.  Even though it is only a two door car there is a lot of room in the back for the other passengers.  The worst thing about this car is probably that it only fits four people, but it is not that bad of a draw back.<br><br>
