            Oh, how I hate car payments, but the time had arrived! We had begun to look around for a new vehicle, thinking we would have about a year before giving our 93 Chevy S10 Blazer to our son. Then it happened! Our sons car did not cooperate, it rolled to a stop and died.

So off we went, and began looking for another vehicle. It did not take long to settle on a Dodge Caravan. I had decided I did not want another sport utility vehicle, and as we looked, I also realized I would never again be happy with a regular car. The Dodge Caravan seemed to offer the best of both worlds.

It sits higher than a car, but lower than an SUV, which did away with the problem of easy rollovers. But another important ingredient was its capacity to carry a load of kids, luggage, or lumber! With all the seats in place it will easily seat 7 adults.  The rear bench seat and the two second row bucket seats can all be taken out for carrying a large item or a large number of items.  The second row bucket seats can be left in with only the back bench seat out for a smaller load. The bench and bucket seats can also be interchanged for whatever the seating need might be.

We have had our 99 Dodge Caravan SE for 3 1/2 months now and I am very pleased with it.  We drove 2,800 miles round trip over spring break this year and found the ride to be very comfortable and the fuel economy very refreshing. We averaged about 26 miles to the gallon on the open road.

Another nice feature is the driver side sliding passenger door. Passengers can get in or out on either side of the vehicle. The sliding passenger doors are equipped with child protection door locks which are easily activated if you should have the need.

Under the front passenger seat is a nice slide out drawer for incidental storage, as well as a standard glove box on the dash. There is a removable mesh net between the two front bucket seats for storage. 

This Caravan comes with power door locks and remote keyless entry. This is really nice, when you are approaching your car at night. One press of the button on the key fob unlocks only the driver door and turns on the interior lights. Two presses of the button unlocks all the doors and turns on the interior lights. One press of the lock button on the key fob locks all the doors and the liftgate and the horn chirps once in acknowledgement.

As mentioned in the beginning, the rear bucket seats and the bench seat disengage quite easily. My daughter discovered this when she asked what the handle was for at the same time she was pulling on it. Her seat unlatched and she was rocking around on it while we looked for a likely spot to pull off the road to latch it back in. We had a good laugh about it, but it really wouldn't be funny if this happened and then you had to make an emergency stop.

 To disengage the bucket seats you pull up on the release handle located under the seat and move the handle forward. The seats can also be either reclined or folded forward and they can also be tilted forward for easy access to the rear.

 The rear bench seat can be adjusted to any of three positions and can also be folded forward to allow for additional cargo space without removal of the seat. The Rear bench seat release levers are located on the rear legs. All you do is squeeze each release handle and rotate downwards and the seat releases and wheels are deployed which allow for easily rolling the seat out.

 While the seats are easily disengaged and re-engaged, they are quite heavy and unless you are a big guy like my husband, you will need two people to remove them from the van.

Another really nice feature we noticed is that all the window switches and door locks have a tiny light in them, so they are easily located in the dark and you are not fumbling around trying to find them.

 The outside mirrors have an electric remote switch located on the instrument panel, and this is also softly lit with a light inside the switch. They are also hinged and can be moved forward or rearward to resist damage.

The windows are tinted which is a big plus for those of us who live in sunny Florida. The all over look of the Caravan is streamlined and clean.
