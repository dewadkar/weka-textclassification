            We bought our 1997 Ford Ranger Supercab brand new off the showroom floor back in July of 97.  It was a base model with nothing extra besides automatic transmission.  Which was kinda pricey.

Body:  The Body has some curves that didn't think you could put on a truck.  It is curved all around, which is great considering a few years before the truck looked like a box with a cut out for the bed.  I haven't had any dents in it, and scratchs are very minute due to the excellent clear coat the car came with.

Interior:  The interior is pretty plain but it meets all of my families needs.  The car has the 60/40 split front seat with the armrest attached to the driver side seat.  The armrest is annoying especially while driving.  The back seats are pull down jump seats which even though they don't look comfortable, are pretty comfortable and spacious even if an adult needs to fit back there.  The key word is A adult.  Two adults would have problems dealing with legroom.  The windows and locks are manual but you get used to them after a while.  The rear slider in the rear really helps to get the air moving if you need to cool down the cabin quickly.  Air conditioning when needed can be turned on for abou 5 minuntes and then turned off due to the quick cooling.

Seats:  The front seats are extremly comfortable.  I have taken many long trips in them and was considering driving across the country just for the fun of it.

Radio:  The radio is just the base tape/am/fm radio which is ok for a truck which really isnt supposed to be a "Luxury" vehicle.  The speakers are very good, but i just had one go out on me.

Truck bed: The truck bed i got with the optional liner in it.  Make sure the one you buy has one or get one for it, b/c it prevents scratching.  It makes the truck also look better.  I have hauled everything in my bed, from fire wood,to sand, and also plywood.  The bed is great for the family who needs a truck to haul something, but not one that is huge.

Engine:  The strong V6 has given me no problems since i bought it.  I have given it oil changes every 3000 miles like i am supposed to but i guess it paid of since the engine is still running strong.

In conclusion this truck is a great buy for the money even if you don't get all the extras.
