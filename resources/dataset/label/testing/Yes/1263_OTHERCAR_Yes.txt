            Early adopters of any technology always pay a higher price in some way, either sacrificing cash or quality. Until this camera, digital photography simply hasn't been worth bothering with except for some photojournalists, commercial photographers (using multiple pass, large format equipment) and scientists. Given the difference in image quality between film and digital images smaller than 3 million pixels, digital cameras before this one were simply a way to pay more money for a poor quality image.

Not only is the quality of the image acceptable (particularly when coupled with the new Epson line of color printers), but this is as close as one can come to a system camera outside of the higher priced digital SLRs. It has accessories available such as hot-shoe mounted speedlights, screw-on filters (ND, UV, and Polarizing), screw-on lens convertors (giving you focal length equivalents ranging 15mm to over 350mm in 35mm systems), a remote controller, and an adapter to copy 135 negatives and transparencies. Traditional Nikon customers will feel very much at home with the quality of the accessories as well as the prices (for example, the remote controller set me back $150).

The lens converters are Nikon glass and in all likelihood, exceed the resolving power of this generation of chip. That is good in case future versions of this camera continue to accept these same lenses. Those cameras will certainly have higher pixel counts than this one. The 3X teleconverter even sports Nikon's ED (extra low dispersion) glass as well as tremendous light-gathering capabilities. The Fish-eye converter is an amazing tool as well. One can use it in two modes; full frame or fish-eye. I am very concerned about damaging the surface of the glass however. Time will tell. I'm still awaiting the wide-angle converter, so I can't report on that yet.

There are, of course, multiple modes that one can operate the camera in and after a short time, it is very easy to make changes such as adjusting the flash mode through choices like none, always on, slow-synch, red-eye, and auto. There is also an easy to use focusing range limiter which you can set to full, macro, or distance. This last setting prevents a near object focus search if someone passes between you and your distant subject.

Some of the menu settings are rather daunting for the uninitiated. Using the optional lens convertors requires selecting the appropriate lens in one of the menus. This in itself is not difficult, but rather unintuitive. As with many of the features, infrequent use will slow down a casual photographer trying to go beyond point-and-shoot. I'm speculating that the vast majority of these cameras will never be used to even twenty-five percent of their feature set. The price point is so low that this will be a favorite among people with more money than knowledge of photography. But, for the photographer that understands film based exposure, flash, reciprocity, and lens selection, this is a very welcome choice among some very mediocre to poor quality digital cameras.

If you're going to buy the Nikon 990, I would recommend two accessories in particular: rechargeable NiMH batteries, and a compact flash card reader for your computer. This camera will eat you out of house and home, particularly if you don't use the optional AC adaptor when uploading the files to your computer. Microtech sells a compact flash reader for Macs and Windows machines for about $60 US. By using the card reader to load images into your computer, and using the ACCU cells (mine are from Everready), one can significantly lower the huge cost of power consumption.

I plan on keeping this camera for no more than a year and a half. By that time, higher quality and lower priced cameras will certainly be available. This is by no means a camera that can compete with my 35mm Nikon system, but it is the best image quality in its price class, is finally producing an image of useable quality, and has a tremendous feature set (including matrix metering).<br><br>
