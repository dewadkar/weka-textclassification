            I've got a <b>1999 Chevy Venture</b> (hunter green), and I have never been happier with anything I've ever driven! It's roomy, has every option, and it drives well. As someone who goes on road trips a lot, and has three children to carpool around every day, the Chevy Venture is a dream come true! 

<b>Power doors and windows</b>, <b>front and rear heating controls</b>, <b>tinted windows</b>, <b>front and rear radio/cassette/CD controls</b>, and plenty of <b>cup holders</b> and <b>storage space</b>. The seats are easy to remove, and lightweight. Ventures <b>seat 7 or 8 people</b>, depending on if you get captain's chairs or not. It's even easy to get into the very back seats. You just lift the middle seat forward, and there is plenty of room to get in. 

My favorite thing of all ~ a <b>remote controlled sliding rear passenger door</b>! What a lifesaver when your arms are full of groceries! The new Ventures come equipped with a <b>TV and VCR</b> ~ an option that can be put into older versions. This is a bonus for the children - who can control the TV from controls in the back. 

The <b>Chevy Venture</b> is THE van to have for a busy mother!<br><br>
