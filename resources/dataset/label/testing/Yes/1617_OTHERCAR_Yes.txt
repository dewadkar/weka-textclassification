            In 1994 my husband and I as newlyweds purchased a 1995 Geo Prism.  Well, in 1996 we had some bad luck with it (not mechanically we were in a tornado and it suffered a lot of damage) so we traded it in for 1996 Geo Prism LSI.  I'm not one to keep cars, but we still have it.  It has been a WONDERFUL car, very dependable, a lot of power for a compact, and very little maintenance.  It still looks new (when I clean it!) and doesn't look out of style one bit.  I feel safe when I drive it and feel comfortable on the road.<br><br>
