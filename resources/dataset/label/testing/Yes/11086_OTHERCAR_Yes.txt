            I have never seen a car drive like this one. It has everything you would want in a sports car and much more. It is stylish and its the type of car that when it drives down the street, people stare at it(hopefully no accidents occur). 

Steering: 10
Wow! This car hugs the turns while going 70 mph. It is extremely easy to drive and I bet that a 10 year old could drive it(with proper instruction). Once you drive this car you will be in love.

Acceleration: 10
You can't go much faster (0-60) than you can in this car. I'm not sure of the exact time but I would bet that its around 5 or 6 seconds.

Braking: 10
When your going that fast, you need good brakes. I was going about 50 with a car right ahead of me and had to brake suddenly. I thought I would crash the car (I almost did). I was maybe a few inches away. Ironically, the car almost killed me but it also saved my life.

Other Perks:
The convertible top is very easy to put down, with a touch of a button. It is an affordable convertible and it is one of the only convertibles that has all-wheel drive.

Conclusion:
I think that this car is the best convertible on the market and for a very affordable price. I give this car a 10!<br><br>
