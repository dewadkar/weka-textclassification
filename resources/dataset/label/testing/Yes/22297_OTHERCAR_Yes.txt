            My wife and I drives a 97 Ford F150, and don't have any plans of getting a van, but after we saw this Mazda MPV, everything else change..

The moment we saw it, we fall in-love with it, all the design are premium but w/ less price, plus a good sound system...

Driving this MPV is just like driving a sedan, so smooth and responsive, also stops and handle well...

For anyone looking for a Minivan, I truly recommend this! Its strong !
Plus its not so expensive, We've got the MPV LX w/ 6 disc cd changer &amp; we also got the GPX package and it really looks cool, so sporty ....But for those who like to spend more money and don't want to save then go ahead let those other ME MINIVAN TOO rip you off!!!<br><br>
