            My wife and I bought the two door 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier after her older Cavalier died. (She practically ran it to death!). We decided before hand that we both liked the Chevrolet Cavalier line, and that we would probably look into getting another one. We had already bought the four door 2000 Cavalier six months prior to purchasing this one (to replace the Pontiac I ran into the ground) and were thinking of getting a second hand car. When we saw the two door 2001 Cavalier and it�s price tag, we just had to take it for a spin. We ended up buying the 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier new.

Now that I have owned and have driven it for the past 9 months, here is my report card...

<b>What It Has:</b>

First of all, the price we paid for this car was $13,000.00. It has everything the four door 2000 Cavalier has, but no cruise control. Oh well.

- 2.4L four Cylinder Engine. This engine has enough torque to zip you down the highway and then some.

- Transmission: Automatic.

- Two door. 

- Cruise control available. Mine doesn't have it.

- Both front seats are easily adjustable and swing forward to allow access to the back seats. Will seat a family of 5 comfortably. Ideally, adults up front with children in the back. There is enough leg room for the average person to sit in the back, but if you are tall like me, it can get a little cramped.

- Trunk release inside car. Back seat pulls down and lays flat to allow you access to the trunk, or to allow you more cargo room when either the back seat or trunk isn�t enough space. This came in handy recently when we pulled into a mall parking lot while it was raining cats and dogs, and we realized the umbrella was still in the trunk. I just reached back and pulled down the back seat and got it.

- Trunk holds plenty of cargo.

- Audio CD player - standard! Also includes and FM/AM radio. Has all the standard buttons allowing you to change radio stations, CD tracks, treble, bass, balance, fade etc. Buttons are easily accessable while driving. Sounds pretty darn good for a factory installed sound system! Beats a tape cassette player!

- AC air. Even on the hottest day, you can turn on the cold, and after about a minute, this baby cranks out the COLD air.

- Front and back defroster works quickly.

- Gas mileage is good. You can go about 400 miles average on a full tank of gas (I think it�s about a 15 gallon tank). That�s roughly 26 miles per gallon. How much running the AC air affects this I have yet to determine. Not running the AC probably improves this.

- Internal computer monitors the whole system, right down to the tires. In dangerous weather conditions, will adjust tire spin to compensate (and it works well too!).

- Under the hood, the engine is <i>not</i> covered up to prevent you from doing routine maintenance. The oil dipstick, transmission dipstick, brake fluid, and washer fluid fill points are all obviously accessible.

- Uses the new longer lasting <i>pink</i> antifreeze/engine coolant.

<b>Crash/Safety Test Reports:</b>

You can search the internet as I did to find out how the 2001 Cavalier faired in the standard crash tests. After looking at a few different sites giving crash test stats, it looks like the 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier scores average, according to various safety tests. Not great, and not poorly, just average. That should be good enough for most people.

- Twin Airbags up front, standard.

- Seat belts in the back seat have over the shoulder straps like the ones up front, to keep your head from flying into the seat in front of you should you be riding back there if the car is in an accident.

<b>How It Performs:</b>

Before we decided to get this car, we had tried a couple of other cars. I wasn�t impressed with them. It seemed that their engines were underpowered. But when I drove the 2001 Cavalier, I found it to have the same "pickup" and "zip" that our 2000 Cavalier has. In fact, the handling of this car is almost identical to the 2000 Cavalier. When you step on the gas, you can feel torque. Mind you, it is not a high performance muscle engine or anything, but you can feel the zip! I like it because it handles like the old 1985 Pontiac Sunbird I used to have. For a four cylinder engine, the 2001 Cavalier has all the horsepower you need for zipping around in heavy traffic - especially in the big cities. When you need to get up and go, the engine responds well.

- Comfort: I have long legs. The seats are comfortable and can go all the way back to give you plenty of room for your legs. The big doors make it easy to get in and out.

- Going up steep hills: Going up steep, curvy hills in this car, the engine does it without having to go much over 3000RPMs, if you are going at least 40+ MPH when you start your way up. 

- In heavy wind: The sleek lines of the outer body allows the 2001 Cavalier to cut through the wind. Some cars tend to drift all over the road in heavy winds. Not this one.

- In heavy rain: The computer controls and makes appropriate adjustments to the tires whenever it senses the wheels are not spinning together. In high torrential like rains, it holds the road well, as I found out. I�ve had to drive through downpours like this a few times. I had to pull over once because I just couldn�t see the road, other wise I would have kept going.

- In Snow and Ice: Weather conditions like snow, sleet and ice are one of the reasons I like this car - it handles these kinds of conditions well. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid some people have to be in bad weather. When there�s ice, the sensible thing to do is to take it easy going across it. But there are times when even if you are doing everything you can to be careful, the ice still causes you to fishtail all over the place. Last winter, I was coming around a steep corner and hit some ice. There was another car coming the other way too. The moment it happened, I thought I was definitely going to have an accident. But only a split second later, I suddenly felt the transmission switch into what felt like "four wheel drive", I stopped sliding and the car suddenly straightened itself out. I don�t think I slid more than six inches before the computer kicked in and straightened things out. I was rescued from a fender bender.

<b>Pros:</b>

- The price. Won�t cost you an arm and a leg to own a brand new one!

- Looks nice and sporty on the outside. Is comfortable on the inside.

- Engine has good torque. Runs quietly, and smoothly.

- Has features some of the more expensive cars have.

- Not cheaply built.

- An awful lot of people seem to be driving the 2000 - 2001 Cavalier models lately. Must be because it�s a good car!

<b>Cons:</b> I wish it had come with cruise control and tilting steering wheel.

<b>Recommendations:</b>

This is a good car for those with a family of no more than five people.
