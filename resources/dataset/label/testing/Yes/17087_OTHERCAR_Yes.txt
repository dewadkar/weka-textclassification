            I bought this vehicle for a couple reasons.  First of all i have owned a couple Mercedes before and their record for quality is unbelievable.  So when i found out they had an SUV i was ecstatic.  I went down to the dealer and test-drove it and it was great.  It handles great it is not like all other SUV's though there is the Mercedes luxury thrown in their which makes the driving experience even better.  The Sound system was great and seating for 5 was comfortable.  Their is one downside to the size of the car however; When you put the third seat in the back there is almost no room for legs unless you are a two-year old.  But without the third seat in the back there is TONS of cargo room more than I have ever seen so if driving with 7 people in the car is not what you need and you like the extra room in the trunk this is a Great car.<br><br>
