            I was going to get a SUV, but when on the lot a feel in love with the style and look of the Intrepid ES.  After reviewing all the options, I made my decision and bought one.

You can get everything you ever want in this car and still afford it.  At first I was worried about how much room there would be.  I travel a lot and have tons of luggage and trunks.  To look at the trunk closed, you would think it is small, but when you open it up, there is so much space.  The choice of colors is great and the Dodge people were excellent.  The engine is so quiet, sometimes I don't think I started it yet.  On the road, it's so smooth and quiet.  The Intrepid handles well in every situation.  For $24,000 this is a list of what I got with the car:  3.2 liter V6 engine, sunroof, dual power seats, home link system, automatic control climate, power everything, cup holders in front and back, rear split fold down seat, leather interior, AM/FM cassette with 4 cd changer 240 watt amp, 9 speakers, and anti-theft system.

I have no complaints on this car.  I would highly recommend the Intrepid ES.  It is a mixture between a luxury sports sedan.  I think it makes a great family car.<br><br>
