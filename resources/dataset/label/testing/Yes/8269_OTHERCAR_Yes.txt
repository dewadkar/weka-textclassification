            First of all, I will admit that the 5400 is not necessarily the ideal camera for the family snapshooter.  It is a bit more complicated to use than other cameras.  It doesn't focus as fast indoors as other cameras which have a focus assist light, and its built-in flash provides illumination that is a bit uneven.

However, it is the ideal camera for the serious photographer who understands the principles of photography.  Its zoom lens range, starting at 28mm equivalent, lets you capture shots in tight situations that most other digicams simply can't.


Its combination of features for the serious photographer are unmatched by anything else this small and compact.  It fits easily into a jacket pocket, and weighs only 360 grams including the battery.  It is the ideal camera to carry around all day without feeling that it is a burden.  Hence, it is the ideal camera for travellers, hikers and cyclists.

In a recent comparison of six cameras, leading expert Peter Inova ranked it the best for travel, at http://www.digitalsecrets.net/secrets/Travel2003.html

Ergonomically, it is wonderfully designed, with a big rubberized grip that lets you hold it steady, unlike competitors such as the Canon S50 and Sony.

Exposure is generally excellent, and good detail is preserved in highlights in sunny situations.

The full auto mode on the 5400 is not very well designed.  For good results, you have to go into Program mode and change some of the defaults.  For example, to get accurate focussing, the best selection is single spot focus, rather than the default wide area focussing that you get in full auto mode.

One of the other reviewers said that it is not as sharp as his Canon S50. However, the 5400 runs rings around the Canon in terms of lens quality.  Its lens is sharp corner to corner even at f/2.8, whereas the Canon's lens has very soft corners wide open.  The 5400's lens is also very resistant to flare.

The 5400 is also very convenient to use once you have read the manual.  Controls for important adjustments such as ISO are very quickly accessible through the mode dial.

In fact, picture quality is superb.  The default image sharpening in the 5400 is a little on the soft side.  Just set sharpness to maximum, and it will not be significantly less sharp than the Canon S50.
