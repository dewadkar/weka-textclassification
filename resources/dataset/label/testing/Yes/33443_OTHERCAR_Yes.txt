            We bought our Jetta in October 1999.  Remarkably, it continues to bring us good surprises.

Examples:

Power in trunk for DC powered devices (power inverter, etc.)

Radio/CD can be turned on without a key.

Engine compartment stays very clean.

Trunk, with back seats down will hold skis.

Highway mileage at 80 MPH averages 30 MPG.

Hold five people and luggage for long trips in comfort.

Downsides:

Beige Cloth is easy to soil, difficult to clean (duh).

Seat reclining is difficult with a twist knob.

We are totally satisfied with our Jetta.  We own three other vehicles (Toyota, Acura, Suburban) but fight over who gets to drive the Jetta.
