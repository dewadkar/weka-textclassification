            I was very fortunate and won my ricoh digital camera in a drawing.  I had no experience with digital cameras or had I been looking to purchase one.  I love mine!  It is easy to use.  It has great quality and I use it all the time. 
 We had to get a bigger disk drive on our computer so I could store all my pictures and make nice slide shows for when I have family over.  The picture quality is excellent and I have had a lot of fun with it. 
 I am not a good photographer so the ability to erase bad photos is one of my favorite features.
 It took me a while to get used to the slowness of the picture taking but I have learned to deal with it.  I still use my regular camera on action shots when I have to have pictures taken back to back.
I also invested in rechargeable batteries it uses 4AA in about 50 pictures with the display on.
I would encourage anyone looking for a digital camera to look at the ricoh.<br><br>
