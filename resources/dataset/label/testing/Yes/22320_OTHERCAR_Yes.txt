                      Back in 1996 my brother bought a 1992 Cadillac Eldorado.
he loves it ,but we're not to thrilled. Ever since he bought the car it has been one thing after another (he just plain runs his cars into the ground,by doing stupid things). Lets get back to the car.He does a lot of driving from around town to Florida. When he got the car it was a dream to good to be true. He bought the car because it handled good and the gas mileage was great. We've had lots of odd things go wrong with it from interier warning lights that won't shut off to door handles (plastic) freezing and braking off. Also on several occasions the driver mirror and the passenger seat lumbar would begin to act up(the mirror would move and the seat would inflate and deflate).But over all we give this gem a thumbs up!
