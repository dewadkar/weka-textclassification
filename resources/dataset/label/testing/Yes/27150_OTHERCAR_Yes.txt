            This is our second Astro van, my husband is using our old one for his business. I really like this van and wouldn't buy any other but there are some things I don't like.

Before buying this van we looked at all the minivans and I feel they are just so small inside, if I'm getting a van I'm getting some room to actually fit my children, dog, stroller, tons of groceries and tons of other items we end up bringing along. This van definitely fits all that and more.

The inside is very comfortable and roomy, we have two bench seats and then two regular seats up front. We have the extended model so there is plenty of storage in the back. There are three cup holders in the back and a double one up front. Stereo system is good. It is very easy to drive and easy to see in front of you, meaning you don't see your hood sticking out 3 feet in front of you. The back door of the van has three doors, there is a hatchback door that goes up and then two small doors that open out, this is very convenient. Also, this way you do not see those double doors when looking out your rear view mirror.

The downfalls, of course it's a gas guzzler. This van is still rear wheel drive which makes it very difficult to maneuver in the winter. The van is not sealed very well, in meaning, when you drive at highway speeds, you can hear lots of air rushing in, it's very difficult to hear the radio, or someone talking. It will be amazing if I ever have a car where I can hear a pin drop in it.

We haven't had much luck with either of our vans mechanically, so far on this van we've had to replace the shocks on the hatchback door it quit holding the door up, the bearings on the sliding side door had to be replaced, the door was not opening and closing very well. We still need to have the up/down switch for the drivers window replaced at times it doesn't work.

The absolute worst thing about this van is the fuel pump noise. There is a very loud humming noise that can be heard in the van and I'm sure people outside can hear it as well. Sometimes this is so loud you feel like you are going crazy. We have had it replaced once because they say if it is at a certain decibel level it can be replaced on your warranty, well that didn't work, I think it got worse.

I think, overall, this is a very good van to get, sometimes you just have to learn to deal with certain imperfections in order to get the things that are important to you. (Like lots of room)<br><br>
