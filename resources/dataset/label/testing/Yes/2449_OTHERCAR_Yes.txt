            My husband and I purchased our first Toyota last week. We purchased the 2001 Toyota Tacoma 4x4. Impulse Red!

The reason for our purchase was top replace a failing 1988 minivan. We wanted a pickup truck. However since mid-size trucks were WAY out of our price range (starting around $25k), we went with a smaller truck. Our main reason was to get something with a bed, 4x4 preferably.

Our second choice was a 2000 GMC Sierra. We also looked at Dodge, Ford and Chevy, all out of our price range, even for the smaller versions.

We looked further into Toyota and at no point were we ever uninterested. A very large part of the reason for our choice was because of Toyota's reputation. We wanted something that would hold it's value for at least 5 or 6 years. Something that wouldn't be considered 'junk' when we decided to trade it.

The starting price was around $21k. After all the dealing was done, we walked out with the truck for about $18,500. It has AM/FM cassette, CD player, 5 speed transmission, 4x4 and a bedliner. (Having never owned a truck, I was surprised at the sticker price, for such "minimal" amount of vehicle!) But after shopping around, this was by far our best buy.

I test drove the automatic transmission. (I am learning to drive a 5 speed!) I really enjoyed how the truck handled. For a female driver, it wasn't rough or bouncy. I felt comfortable with the size of the truck. My view all around was great - no blind spots! The bed of the truck didn't bounce or skip when I went over bumpy roads. The only thing that was awkward, was getting into the vehicle. Since it's a 4x4, it sits up higher than most, so it was strange having to 'climb' inside!

My husband loves the truck. It's his new toy! He is pleased with all of the mechanical aspects: engine size, horse power, rear differentials, etc.

So for you gals out there looking for a girl-friendly truck that is manly under the hood, the Toyota Tacoma 4x4 is really a fun and reliable choice.
