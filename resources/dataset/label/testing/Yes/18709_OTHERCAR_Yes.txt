            There�s no question Ford is having a hard time in the current market.  The truly unfortunate side of this is that Ford�s corporate troubles have shifted the focus away from their products, which in some cases are actually quite good � the Ford Focus immediately jumps to mind.

The Lincoln LS is sum total of all that Ford can do right. Next to the Thunderbird, the Lincoln LS is probably the best all-around car Ford has ever built, and coincidentally the T-bird shares the LS� underpinnings. In the simplest terms, the LS is a front engine, rear-wheel drive, sport sedan with handling characteristics similar to the best Europe has to offer.

While certainly not a bold styling exercise, the LS does have a clean, uncluttered look � it is contemporary without being trendy. The traditional Lincoln �waterfall� grille adds an upscale touch to the front, while the head lights behind glass and large wrap-around tail lights which taper to a point on the side seem to hint at the Mitsubishi Diamante. Yes it�s true, the LS does look a bit like a Diamante from certain angles.  Here is the problem, the Diamante is a fine car, but do Lincoln owners want their car confused with a second string Japanese brand? Not likely. The LS is a good looking car, but it�s outward appearance fails to inspire the way, say, a BMW or Audi might. 

As sort of an aside, the Lincoln LS look much more substantial, luxurious and European when dressed in a dark color such as black. Lighter colors such as white or gold simply don�t do LS justice.

Inside the LS Sport is a pleasant place to pass the time, but similar to the exterior, the interior fails to �wow� us the way a luxury car ought to. Gages are arranged in a sporty, semi circular manner. A tachometer is included � a must for a sport sedan. Audio and climate control functions fall to hand nicely, and in general, everything is where it ought to be. Although the dash and switchgear have a definite Ford look, and seem well made, they lack that extra bit of quality and attention to detail one would expect from a Lincoln.

Lincoln offers and �audiophile� stereo up grade, but it pales in comparison to the near perfect Mark Levinson system available in most Lexus cars. The Lincoln audio system is still above average in terms of sound quality, but can sound a little bass heavy at times. A 6-disc CD changer is a nice feature; many luxury cars costing twice the LS� sticker price require you to change CDs by going to the trunk or glove box. So kudos to Lincoln for giving an in-dash CD player, but why is there not enough storage space up front to hold 6 CD cases. The LS interior needs more storage areas, no question about it.

Seats feel very hard at first, this is certainly in keeping with the LS Sport�s sporty theme, but a little more luxury seems in order at first glance. After a few days of seat time it becomes obvious how truly comfortable and supportive the seats really are.  They don�t hug you tightly the way some sporty cars do, but they do offer adequate support � no lower back pain or numb butt on long trips.

On the road the LS Sport lives up to its sporting image; handling is quick and precise, while the steering offers plenty of feedback without sacrificing the cars luxury side. There is very little lean or body roll even during hard cornering.  In many way the LS road manners remind one of the V8 Oldsmobile Aurora, and yet even the somewhat sporty Aurora exhibits an unacceptable amount of lean when cornering � not so with the LS.  Believe it or not, the LS Sport handles like a much more expensive European car � frankly it is very BMW-like. In tight turns the LS Sport corners more flatly and is much more fun than even the pricey Lexus LS 430.  

All this spirited handling built into the LS should be accompanied by and equally spirited engine, and while the LS Sport�s power plant is no pavement scorcher, it gets the job done. A 3.9 liter V8 is available, but only with a select shift automatic transmission which is similar to Tiptronic. If you want to shift you own gears you�ll have to make due with a 220 hp, 3.0 liter V6.  The shift-it-yourself feature is fun, but the 2 to 3 up shift consistently acted funny when shifted under hard acceleration. Once the driver gets to the desired shift point in 2nd gear, a gentle push of the shift lever causes the car to move up one gear (or down one depending on which direction it is pushed) the car would seem to jump right into third, but a split second later felt as if it shifted again. All this action never reduced the engine�s power or felt unsettling, it just seemed odd for a shift-it-yourself transmission.

At 252 hp, the Lincoln V8 is no dog. Similar cars such as the Lexus ES300 and Chrysler 300M are available only with V6 engines and front-wheel drive. However in the case of the 300M the horsepower is equal, if Chrysler can get 253 hp out of their V6, Lincoln should be able to get more than 252 out of their V8. The Lexus GS line of cars seems comparable; both the six-cylinder version of the LS and GS produce 220 hp, and both GS and LS offer an optional V8.  The GS430 is a much more expensive car and makes about 50 more horsepower than the less expensive LS Sport V8. The 2002 LS Sport has an MSRP of about $38,700. Add a sunroof, chrome wheels, All-season package and an in-car communications system (similar to OnStar) and the price runs up to $42,500.  Add similar features to a GS430 and you�ll quickly find yourself in the $57,000 neighborhood. Ah HA ! now the LS� true nature is being discovered, it offers a luxury-sport sedan qualities at a substantial savings over more traditional rear-wheel drive luxury sedans. 

Essentially the LS Sport is a car all about value. The LS offers more room, similar comfort and equal performance to the pricier European sport sedans. The LS will most likely appeal to two major groups of car buyers: 1. Those that want a fine luxury/sport sedan without having to dip into the kids (or grandkids) college fund. 2. Those that can afford any luxury/sport sedan they want but prefer to buy American.  I promise, you will not find an American designed car that is more European than the Lincoln LS.
 
Overall, the LS Sport is an attractive but conservative looking car that can run well with the mid sized Audis, Lexus and BMWs. The LS Sport�s main drawback is the interior. While no one could argue with the ample leg, hip and shoulder room, there is a distinct lack of overall Lincoln-ness in the cabin. Also storage space is limited. On the positive side, the LS provides a genuine alternative to those shopping for the much more expensive Lexus GS430, or BMW 540i � just be sure to order your LS in a dark color, it looks so much better that way.
