            What a fantastic car. We bought this car for my wife a little over a year ago. Because of it's fuel economy, we wanted a TDI, which is VW's nomenclature for their diesel engines. It stands for Turbo Direct Injection, which is a somewhat different diesel technology than what we (in the US at least) saw from the Big 3 Detroit companies back in the 80's.

Why we (my wife and I) like this car:

<b>1. Fuel Economy</b>
This car gets fantastic fuel economy. We've got the TDI automatic GLS. Even with the A/C running and going around 70-75 mph on the interstate, we average about 43 mpg.  In town, that number drops to about 38-40, depending on traffic.

<b>2. Handleing & Power</b>
What more can I say. This is European car and handles like one. Curvy mountain roads are a dream.

These cars are all over Europe (they're called Bora instead of Jetta over there), where speed limits are not necessarily in effect, especially on the rural Autobahns.  As such, this car can fly. Don't let the diesel fool you. It may only have 90 hp, but it's got loads and loads of torque in the lower rpm ranges.  Several times i've caught myself going 90 and not even realized it.  The TDI feels more responsive than the standard VW 2.0 4-cyl. But, from a power standpoint, the 1.8T and VR6 are clearly stronger, and feel so.  But the neither the 2.0 litre 4, the 1.8T, nor the VR6 get 40+ mpg. So the question becomes, are you interested in power and awesome fuel economy, or are you interested in lots and lots of power and o.k. fuel economy?

<b>3. 100,000 mile drivetrain warranty</b>
This is great, but the car only has a 24,000 bumper to bumper warranty.

<b>4. Misc. "Cool Things"</b>
-You can roll up or roll down the windows and/or open and close the sunroof all from the driver's side exterior door lock--even if the car isn't on. This is a great feature that I love. How many times have you parked your car and forgotten to roll up the windows, only to have to unlock the car again and either manually roll up the window, or put the key in the ignition and hit the power window switch?

-Cool styling. Lot's of people have told me how great looking this VW is.

-Free service for the first 24,000 miles or 2 years. This includes oil changes, filter changes, etc.

What don't I like?

1. There are some squeaks and rattles that appear occasionally around the rear interior door handles. Dealer has yet to figure out the cause.

2. The dealers and service departments can be difficult to deal with. We've dealt with 3 separate dealers in two different states. They do good work, but are somewhat haughty and unresponsive. The salesmen are especially difficult. They've got a popular car to sell and they know it.

3. 24,000 bumper to bumper warranty seems subpar, though the 100,000 drivetrain warranty is nice.

A note about the cd changer. If you have the standard VW radio/cassette in your car, don't opt for the dealer installed cd-changer. It runs about $600. Instead, go to crutchfield.com and order yourself a panasonic changer. The standard radio will talk to a panasonic changer by default. Crutchfield will give you all the hardware you need to install it (there is no cutting, drilling, soldering, etc. involved). You'll save $300-$350. If you've got the Monsoon radio, which is VW's upgraded audio system, then you may need something else, i'm not sure.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this car. In fact, i'm thinking of selling my truck and getting myself a VW Golf TDI or 1.8T, so that i'm not driving my wife's Jetta all the time!
