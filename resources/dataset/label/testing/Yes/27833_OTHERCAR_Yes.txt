            I paid a fair bit for this car, and I'm not sure it was the best value for money, but in my opinion it is the best in its class. I'm hoping that the resale value holds up so that depreciation ends up costing me less than other cars in the long run.

Mine's a 528iAT (automatic, wagon). I wanted the wagon version for the utility, but I would have preferred the manual transmission - unfortunately it's not a common combination.

Like most buyers, I tried all the competitors (Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, Saab - even VW and Subaru), but the BMW simply drives the best: it's a combination of the handling, the engine, and other components making up the general "feel" of the car. If you're used to a smaller and lighter vehicle with a stiffer suspension, you'll probably find that the 528 feels a bit heavy and soft at first, but it's an impression that disappears for the most part when you push the car harder.

This is a car which seems to have 3 different characters: Cruising around town on city streets and on the freeway with the usual lot of traffic preventing any spirited driving, it seems quiet, comfortable, relaxing. The problems of rush-hour commuting seem more distant than in other cars. But when I find a stretch of clear road and open it up a bit, it takes on a distinctly more aggressive character. There's a muted roar from the engine and a strong surge of thrust. The car handles crisply and takes the curves fast without the least bit of upset over rough pavement. The brakes haul it down from speed without any hint of stress, a quick twitch of the wheel snaps it around obstacles with precise control, and a touch of the accelerator rockets it forward again. And then when I get to where I'm going to pick up people or cargo, it alters its character again into a hauler with ample passenger and cargo space.

The comfortable and luxurious interior, the high quality of materials, fit & finish, and the harmonious style of the exterior and interior contribute to the overall positive feel of the car. The structure seems especially solid - no rattles, squeaks, or flexing over the bumps, even after 18000 miles.

Some might prefer the more powerful V8 of the 540. Personally I find that the 2.8l 6-cyl engine has just enough power, and reasonable fuel economy as well. Needs premium gas though.

The extra cargo area of the wagon is useful, but no more so than most of the competitive wagons. I'd put the BMW wagon in the middle of the pack in terms of space and utility.

Complaints? The climate controls and the stereo are a bit confusing, and take some getting used to (the manual is no help at all). There's a lot of options not included in the standard equipment, and it seems pretty cheap of BMW not to have included them on a car this expensive (e.g. the custom CD changer that they want an extra $800 for, the incomplete tool kit, or the upgraded trip computer and Dynamic Stability Control that add $1000s to the price). But I guess it's hard to criticize a company for charging what the market will bear.

The overall reliability seems a bit better than average for similar vehicles so far, agreeing with the user surveys I've seen. But parts and service could be quite expensive after the warranty is over. It eats brake pads and discs at an alarming rate (a trade-off for the superb braking performance). BMW uses a lot of custom components (like the $300 battery), and service requires a lot of custom tools only available to dealers. One problem area I've heard a lot about on the 5-series is that the front suspension bushings will wear out or break, which causes an annoying shimmy in the sensitive front end if there's even the slightest imbalance in the wheels, tires, or brake rotors. But every car needs a few weaknesses!
