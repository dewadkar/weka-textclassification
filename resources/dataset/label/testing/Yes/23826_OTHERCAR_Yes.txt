                Some of the reasons I bought this car are because I wanted a new car but a low payment, I trust the Toyota name and I liked the look, it's distinctive, kind of like a squished VW Bug but cheaper. My wife and I love the looks of this car so obviously all those who think that it's ugly are wrong. Also I was attracted to the mileage when the best I have gotten for years has been no more than 15 mpg.
     I was surprised buy some of the negative posts. Obviously we must have been driving different cars because they were not even close to my experience. I am 44 years old and have been driving since I was 16. I can say that this is one of the best experiences I've had with a new car, with the possible exception of my 1991 Mitsibishi Montero which I should have NEVER traded in for a Jeep Cherokee.
     My Echo seems to be everything the exact opposite of the negative reviews. It handles very well in fact I just got back from a trip to the mountains with very winding roads and it was actually fun to drive. It takes corners well at speed and the fast food cokes never came out of the cup holders. For those who consider the car &quot;tippy&quot; my experience is just the opposite, it seemed to hug the ground. I have a automatic and at times it searched a bit up steep grades but turning the over drive off fixed that. As far as power goes, it does very well for what it is, a 1.5 liter inline four. Some of the posts I read sounded like they wanted the power of a 4.0L six cylinder. Even with the small engine I found myself effortlessly up to 80 mph on the freeway before I knew it. The ride is quite and very smooth. As far as the interior is concerned, well my wife doesn't like the plastic dash and door panels but it looks OK to me. I walked out the door with my Echo for $13475.00 fully equipped. I don't mind the corner cutting in that area. I would have liked power windows but what the heck, it's one thing less to break down and cost you money. I found I could still make my arm do the circular motion necessary to complete the window rolling operation.
     I would recommend this car to almost anyone. Remember the car stickers at $10,850.00. If your looking for the trim level of a Avalon you will be disappointed.<br><br>
