                I took delivery on 9/29/2002 on what may be the first Audi A4 Cabriolet in the Northwest. Now, with slightly over 1000 miles both on interstates and twisty roads, I can confirm that it is all I had hoped for. I wanted a solid, quality, luxurious, roomy convertible at lower cost than the MB SL's, but still wanted some of the fun I had from driving my 2000 Miata that I traded in.  The A4 delivers.  Its handling is excellent!  Even though at 3800 pounds, it's not a Z3/4 or Miata, it still can corner; I've easily handled corners with 25mph warnings at 50 without my wife bracing herself in the right seat...I wish all my cars allowed that! And that weight gives you a great ride, although I only have the standard (not "Sport") suspension.
     I also am impressed with my dealer, Roger Jobs, who also handles Porsche and VW.  First class, and amazing, a salesman who didn't haggle on either car after I told him I expected to pay sticker on this and invoice-plus on the other (I bought a VW Passat Wagon the same day).  As the first buyer of this Cabriolet, I expected to pay sticker price, and did, but there were no add-ons or premium of any kind even though I took the dealer's first car on the second day it was here, and the trade-in was right out of the books, in fact, a little better (the Passat WAS discounted).  Deals were reasonable and on target based upon my research.
     The Audi was delivered virtually defect-free, other than a slight distortion in about a 1" x 2" portion of the windshield on the passenger side. And the comfort is astonishing, those seats are terrific with more adjustment than any car I've owned (a lot!).  The lined convertible top is extraordinary in its interior appearance (it feels like a hardtop because it's so quiet), and when it's down under the hard, automatic boot, the fitted windscreen means that without a hat, your hair doesn't blow, making this a great convertible experience. Then, with a great Bose factory stereo, it's a real cruiser.  
     It took 500 miles and some city driving to get used to the interface between the accelerator and the brake; when the light turns green there is just a bit of a pause as you release one and hit the other --- they're interlocked in this "fly by wire" technology using the continuously-variable transmission, but then, watch out!  This baby does take off, and is smooth.  The tiptronic makes you believe there are actual specific ratios, but there aren't.  Now that I'm used to it, it's growing on me.  And the range is good, with a big enough tank and, it seems, good mileage, monitored with exotic readout and displays, a la Audi.
     This is a 2003 model, even though e-pinions doesn't let me enter that in the template. Price includes Blue Metallic ($450), "Premium Package" with luxury items ($1,475), Premium Leather Seats ($1,000), Bose Premium Sound System ($650), 17" Wheels ($500), Heated Front Seats ($450), $660 Destination Charge, plus $41,500 Base.
