            After owning a sports car for several years, I decided that it would be a nice change of pace to try out one of the mid-size SUVs.  I have pets and wanted more room to transport them.

I did a great deal of research on the internet: pricing, options, and availability.  There were many &quot;professional&quot; reviews of the various SUVs to choose from and more than enough information on pricing to do an adequate comparison.

In the end I chose the Rodeo primarily because of the price.  I was able to get all the luxury options (power windows/doors, keyless remote) I wanted without breaking the bank.  But I also loved the test drive!  The peppy V6 engine gave me all the power I could need to drive in big city, adn made the switch from a V8 sports car a lot easier.

There have been only two things I haven't liked about the Rodeo.  It's not as comfortable on long drives (over 3 hours).  Also, being a shorter person it's not as easy to get in and out of.  I'll admit that I did expect the latter problem, and will adjust in time.

If you're looking for a mid-size SUV with a lot of pep, but not a large price, then the Rodeo should be a serious consideration for you.<br><br>
