            I love this van! It is roomy enough for the whole family and the seats are quite comfortable and easy to manipulate. Pontiac must have listened to some mom's when they put this one together. There are cup holders all around, storage space on the back of the seats and for the back passengers, side impact air bags and the seat belts are not those annoying automatic ones. The passenger side sliding door is automatic but it must be in park for it to operate. There is also a safety feature which allows the door to reopen if something is in the way but takes enough force that it may not work properly for a small child. The radio volume is on the steering wheel along with a mute button which is wonderful. And there are plenty of vents and outlets.     <br><br>
