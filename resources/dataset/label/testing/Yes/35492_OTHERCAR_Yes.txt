            Well, have had this creature for about 8 months now.  And, it is by far the best van could have hoped for.  After test driving others, along with having driven my folk's Dodge Grand Caravan on occasion, settled on this used version.  

Found it at the local dealer where the previous owner had traded "up" to the EX version.  Funny in that we were only driving by the dealer, saw it on the lot, took her for a test drive, and couple hours later... drove it home!  Having known that there was quite a demand for these, and with its reputation, didn't desire to take a chance on not snagging this one.  So, how do we like it...

Positives:
a. Folding third seat & "the well" - this is quite wonderful and user-friendly.  Nothin more need be said about this...  ;)  Besides that highly recommend the optional plastic liner - much easier to clean/maintain.

b. Sliding doors - on this "lower" version [LX], unlike the 'upscale' EX model, the doors do not have a mind of their own.  We humans are in control...  We decide if we want them to open, and how far...  We decide if we want them to close, when and how fast...  Much prefer things this way.  [of course, buying used, what choice does one have anyhows... ;) ]

c. Stereo [cd] system - the original owner opted for a CD stereo system, and contrary to what have read in most other reviews, have found the system here to be quite pleasant sounding; able to take anything from Enya, Allman Brothers Band, and Waylon Jennings to Queensryche, Rush, Pink Floyd, and Montrose...  it all sounds quite good.  And with road/exterior noise kept to a mininum by the vehicle [at any speeds], can comfortably hear great range of sounds.

d. Handling = great!!!] - smooth, car-like feel for the road.  Can take corners at higher speeds, without any roll feel.  Sharp, crisp driving - not at all "minivan-like".  Am still amazed that this "clunky-looking" auto can perform on the road, straights and corners both, the way it does.  Suppose the design of the suspension has a major role here.  Great job on this!

e. Engine/power - must admit that I drive fast, like in the 80-90 mph range [no, not safe are we...]; but nevertheless, this large/heavy beast cruises with ease at these speeds; so well that you do not really sense that you are anywhere near these speeds.  Fuel economy does not suffer that much neither, still in the ~25 mpg range.  Passing and get-up-and-go are excellent - the new 2002 models with their extra ponies must really go!

f. Air control system - have found this to be quite good, delivering the amount and desired tempered air where we want it - front or back areas.  Like the feature that can turn the a/c compresor off if all you desire is to blow just heated air upon the front window.  Rear controls are good too.

g. Dash layout - everything is well laid out.  Although, will say that the tranny gear-shift/lever placement took some getting used to, being in the way of the radio volume control when the gear is in D4 [overdrive].  However, having drove the van many more miles, find that can easily locate all controls very well.  Lastly, really like the interior light/dome control - very handy 3-way switch.

Now, sorry to say/admit, there are a few "bugs" that could easily been remedied at the design shop, along with one quirk caused by the previous owner's experience:

1. Steering/tire - well, this falls into the "previous owner" category.  Seems that they had a slight accident, whereas the steering linkage, etc was compromised. The dealer has tried to repair this situation, immediately after the accident while the van was still with the previous owner, and with a few attempts since we've owned it.  New tires and another alignment has seemed to have helped the situation much.  However, before this, there was quite abit of vibration in the steering...  hopefully this will not be a permanent problem.

2. Armrest too short - ok, sounds kindof minor, but...  just a couple more inches would make this much more comfortable.  Speaking of which, would really like some extra lumbar support in these seats...

3. Front doors don&#146t remain open - now, this is a problem.  It seems that even on slightly uneven turf, these durn doors desire to close.  There appears to us that the "catch" is not nearly strong enough to prevent the doors from closing.  When asked the dealer/shop about this, they claimed that this was the way it is, on all these vans - and kindof looked at me like I was silly for asking...  well, sorry, but similar to what I mentioned above about the rear sliding doors, when I desire the door to be open, it should be open; when I want it closed, then and only then shall it close.

4. Power [accessory] plug &#150 urrrgh&#133 why why why is there only one of these items, and to make matters worse, its way down thar at floor level???  This one irks us quite abit...  am tempted to cut that durn plastic snap cover off too - does nothing but get in the way.  Will eventually place another outlet somewheres else...  not much thinking on the design team on this one.

5. "Noises" - have noticed of late [past month] an annoying rattle within the upper/front driver-side roof support column.  Have not had chance to investigate if there is something that I can tighten myself within this molding, but its only noticeable on quite rough roads; for now...

6. Engine oil filter - not so much a negative, as a minor complaint that this bugger is semi-difficult to remove and replace.  As I do most of my own oil changes, found the first time I done this to be somewhat of a challenge.  "Must remember to cock the wheels to the right..."  ;)

7. Another slight deal is the lift/tail gate - would prefer this to be maybe just a tad higher when fully opened...  altho' not necessarily tall folk, have found our noggins scraping the bottom of this door if placed just right whilst camping, etc.  Oh, while on the tail end, and this is quite minor, do not like the rear bumper's ability to add moisture to your pant legs around your knee if you come into contact with a seemingly dry bumper [like when loading/unloading the back]...  seems that the black rubber/plastic on top of the bumper can trap moisture, which then transfers to any absorbent material that it comes into contact with.

8. Fuel guage - ok sortof nitpicking, and not too fair to put this here, as most if not all vehicles have this problem.  But... since this is the negative/complaint section; seems that some engineer somewheres can devise a fuel guage that will accurately tell you when the tank is half full, for example.  Strange how autos have a much better fuel economy when they use that first half of the tank... ;)

Well, thats about it...  in the relatively short span of eight months of owning this van, we've placed ~10k miles, and overall am more than pleased with the ride.  Go get one!

 -- 19 April 2003 Update --
Few things:
1. The driving lights are really good, can see quite a bit down the road, and also importantly along the side.  This is good for both safety and convenience, especially when in unfamiliar areas.

2. Not so good: the factory stereo/CD player does not have that good of an indicator for when a CD is in the deck, but not playing.  Quite easy to not see that small inconspicuous green light indicating a CD is in the deck.

3. Another light that is not quite right nor bright enough are those for the vent/heating/AC controls, but mainly during bright daytime conditions.

4. No, not another negative... but, when changing your own oil, careful with the oil drain plug, its a semi-goofy size.  Somewhat just a hair smaller than 11/16" or even 18mm.  Easy to access... unlike the oil filter, which is semi-crammed between the front passenger wheelwell and the engine, yet really not to bad to get to,,, once you realize where it is, and best means to angle your arm. Hint, lay on back, head first under engine, insert right arm up in there, and then rotate.

5. Speaking of filters... the air filter is a bear and a half to change/replace - unlike most other vehicles, which have simple fast-acting clamps, this beast has its lid screwed down! Not a user-friendly design at all.  And your local Wal-Mart still does not have the filters for them... Grrrrrr...

6. Ok, enough negatives... still a wonderful pleasure to drive [well, would like to replace the drivers seat with something resembling my Celica's... ;) ], and still great gas mileage, 25 mpg, even at 80mpg cross country... and with fairly full load of family and belongings... :)
