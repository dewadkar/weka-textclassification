            So I had been looking for a new camera. I searched and read on the Internet for hours. I was debating Sonys, Olympuses... My first camera (the one I was replacing) was a Sony Mavica FD-75 and I wasn't sure if I should stay loyal to the company or expand my horizons. Well, my sister has a Casio QV-4000. She suggested I look into the Casios. And so I did. I immediately fell in love with this sleek little model, the Casio QV-R40.

I have had my Casio QV-R40 for about a week now and have been using it like crazy. Though it is still easy to learn even if you have <i>zero</i> camera knowledge, my familiarity with menus and such gave me a big head start on this camera and I knew where everything was and how to change all the of the controls right away, though I am still learning about what they do. A little background is very, very helpful, but definitely unnecessary with the easy-to-handle Casio QV-R40.

I was shocked at the smallness of the camera itself. It's the perfect size, IMHO. I was expecting a tiny little thing, lightweight, and while this camera is very small, it is larger and heavier than I expected, which I actually liked. It's definitely pocketable (which is one of my favorite "features"), but it has sustenance to it. The weight surprised me; I thought it would be lighter. I like the "heavy feel" to it; personally, it makes me feel like I have a better quality camera (this is an excellent quality camera, don't get me wrong!). The camera is a perfect size for my small hands. The weight and size are comfortable and the smallness is non-imposing.

Bodily, the camera looks great! Its sleek silver body is very appealing. As one of my friends put it, "I just love how it looks. It makes me want to touch it [gentle one-fingered touch]" And it does! You just want to get your hands on it. I see it sitting there, telling me to pick it up and take photos! The only thing, bodily, that has given me a little bit of a problem is the lens popping in and out, which I am very much not used to. It keeps hitting my hand when it comes out, which startles me. But if you are used to a retracting lens, this is not a problem.

Though I still don't know how to use all of them correctly yet, the features on this camera are great! I love the Triple Self-Timer where it takes three images on one timer setting, 2 seconds apart. I do that anyway all the time: "Wait! I have to set it up one more time!!!" This was actually a big seller for me. I love that there are, technically, 15 different size/quality levels to take pictures with: all 5 different file sizes, and then FINE, NORMAL, or ECONOMY on each of those. Even the 640x480 economy setting is great! And on a 256MB card, the worst setting gives you over 2100 images! The 4.0 megapixel quality is superb and gives great pictures every time.

Auto focus is great and hassle-free but it's also nice to have Macro Mode (for getting up close), Infinity Focus (for focusing on things far away) and Manual Focus, where you choose what you want to focus on. White Balance (brightness and contrast, essentially) is a great feature I am still getting the hang of, as well as Exposure Compensation. The on-screen Histogram is useful at determining your exposure levels. I love that the camera can be turned on in three different ways as well: by pressing the REC button, the PLAY button or the ON/OFF button. I think the ON/OFF button is too "sunken in" on the camera to press quickly, so I usually use the REC button to turn it on. The startup time is great! Other features include different flash intensities, red-eye reduction, alarms and an optical viewfinder (with the ability to turn off the monitor).

One of my favorite, already most-used features is the Trimming feature. You can crop the photo right on screen and it will create a <i>new</i> image without replacing the old one. The Rotation tool is useful too. Another seller for me (though I never travel) is that you can set the camera to be on one of 162 cities' times if you travel, so time stamps aren't bungled.

Two other favorites of mine (and the top 2 selling points for me) are the other two recoding modes: Movie Mode and Best Shot� Mode. Movie mode was the one feature in the world I was aching for, and that was my top priority. Though the movies (the longest you can film is 30 seconds at a time) are silent, it, personally, adds to it for me. Best Shot� Mode is perhaps the greatest photographic invention of all time (well, in my mind): it has 21 settings to take photos in. It adjusts for the current situation. Now I will finally be able to take great photos of fireworks, food, candles, greenery. It's wonderful.

The camera has a few little fun features too, like Image Roulette. It will spin all of your images like a slot machine, fast at first, then getting slower and slower until it stops on a completely random photo. There is no point to this but fun. Another fun feature is the startup screen feature, which allows you to see a photo of your choice on the screen for 2 seconds before the camera goes into play or record mode. I don't use this, since I am usually scrambling for a great shot at a moment's notice, but it is still pretty neat. Another cool feature is the Favorites Folder, which is in the 10MB built-in memory, even if you use a memory card, which means they are there until you delete them, even after photo dumps.

The PhotoLoader software it comes with is awful, but it <i>does</i> create pretty cool HTML albums. My PhotoLoader has been troublesome already, but it always works after a try or two. I found another program (it starts up automatically, so I suppose it found me) on Windows XP, but it's a little more confusing to find where your photos went and it doesn't make the cool HTML album. Note of help: Your photos, after the PhotoLoader dump, ended up in the Image Library folder in your CASIO folder under Program Files in your Local Drive).

This is a great camera for the money, and it would take a week just to describe its features, versatility and proficiency.
