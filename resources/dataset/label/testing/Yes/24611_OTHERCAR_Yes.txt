            This review is focused on my observations when I sold this car after 200,000 miles and eight years of ownership by my father.  This white Ciera �S� was originally purchased used with 29,000 miles from a local new car dealer.  Alamo rent a car had formally owned it.

Right off the bat a few things when wrong.  The pulley of the fan belt, alternator and brakes needed replacement by the time the car hit 39,000 miles.  Aside from these things not much else went wrong until the car hit 170,000 miles when the Piston pin failed which required replacement of the engine.  Amazingly the car still ran and drove but sounded very much out of tune.  This car was equipped with a 3.3 liter engine as opposed to the 3.1 used in later versions. The 3.3 does not get as good of mileage (23 hwy) as the 3.1 (26hwy) and is not as common to find.  The replacement cost for this engine was higher than it would have been for the 3.1.  The only other problem was the electrical relays for the radiator system fan.  These would generally only last about 30-40,000 miles.  The ride is comfy enough and steering is accuate. After 200,000 of city driving miles the front steering/suspension had a fair amount of play and needed some work.

This is a very stout car.  It was originally designed in the early eighties and I credit this for the reason the body held up so well.  Door dings were minor and the paint was in outstanding condition despite being parked outdoors much of it life.  I should note the car was waxed regularly thought the ownership. Very, very minor discoloration was present on a few items of door guard trim and the chrome around the window sills.  The only rust was on the tail pipe but the car was regularly driven to the gulf coast (exposure to salt air) and was driven to north Texas during winter with road salt present.  

The dated styling is most evident on the interior.  The car has interior dimensions suggesting more compact then midsize with most of the sacrifice of room being the rear seat.  The rear seat does not fold.  Both a driver�s side airbag and anti-lock brakes were options for 1993; both items became standard on later versions.  The dark blue fabric material used for both the seats and carpet are first rate.  No fading was present and wear was not noticed as well.  A light shampoo got rid of the few stains that had accumulated over the years.  All interior mechanics still worked after 200,000 miles including the power seat reclines.  The dash did have a noticeable shudder when the car went over big bumps.  The A/C system always seemed sligtly under powered and had a hard time getting the car cooled on 95+ degree days but once there it was fine.  I did not like the way most of the A/C vents were clustered in front of the rihgt side passenger, it was difficult to position so that all passengers could get air circulation.

The trunk is good sized and can accommodate a fill sized spare tire.  There is a small nook to the right side where you can store the jack if do this.  I believe GM has a cargo net that snaps right in which helps hold grocery bags in place.  

I was able to sell this car for $2900.00, which I though to be a fair price, to a friend for his daughters first car.  Since her ownership I believe the speedometer cable snapped and the muffler needed replacement.  Not bad for a car with this many miles...
