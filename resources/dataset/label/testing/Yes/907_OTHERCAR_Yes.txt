               MOTOR TREND CAR OF THE YEAR! The Lincol LS is truly the best luxury sedan of 2000. It's competition, the Benz E430, Lexus GS400, BMW 540i, Audi A6, and the Jaguar S-type dont come close, well except for the GS400(because I own one, and it's awesome). The Lincoln finaly created a car that can compete with all of these luxury imports. They put a roaring V-8 thats produces 252hp(good, but I got more from my 300hp GS400). It has a great feel and you feel connected with the road(unlike the Benz E430). The suspension gives you a smooth quite ride that Lincolns have built some of thier reputation on. It has a rear-wheel drive 5-speed automatic transmission. There is plenty of room in the front with an incredible amount of luxuries, not that much wood, and the dash almost resembles that of a GS400. The back is a little cramped, and I was dissapointed with the trunck space,only 13.7cu-ft, thats half of what my GS400 has. The leather seats are incredibly comfortable as in almost all Lincolns. The LS is probably one of the safest cars on the road with its steel frame. The Lincoln LS is a great car, and with a base price of under $35,000, how could you go wrong(other cars in its class have an MSRP of over $40,000). I was skeptical about the reliablilty of an American car, and the L on the front of the GS400 did look good so I went with the Japanese car. I like the GS400, but the LS isn't that bad, I would reccomend it to anyone.
