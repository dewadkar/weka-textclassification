            Yes, this is the manufacturer that many in Deutschland feel is the truest measure of success - Der Stern Auto (The Star Car) they say with a slightly envious timbre. No matter, for those who have the pleasure of owning a Mercedes-Benz, the impeccable record of reliability and safety more than justify the incidental prestige and status such a Marque affords. The CLK 430 continues in the tradition of safety; however, this is a stallion bred from pure racing stock - the CLK-GTR FIA GT World Championship race car (if only a tad bit modified from it's stock brethren). Nevertheless, Mercedes has come through once again to impress and astound with a model filling the niche left vacant for so many years with a coupe donning classic good looks AND performance. In fact, the predecessor dates back to the 220 S Coupe of 1956. 

A casual on-looker could not help but be awestruck by the distinctive frontal view. The now famous oval headlamps from the E-class appear in a slightly more diminutive form to charm and excite. The plush interior can be equipped with many luxury appointments, featuring an onboard navigation and locator system for 2000 - you'll never get lost or have trouble being found; a rear window shade system; almost alien-like mechanically extracting cup holder (only for the US market, of course - Germans are too busy driving to drink in the car). Overall, the cabin ergonomics is first rate including superior primary gauge layout as well as fairly intuitive climate and radio controls. If winter driving is in the cards the K2 package is a must, featuring heated seats and headlight washers. Also available are an integrated phone, CD changer, and many other creature comforts a Mercedes owner has come to expect. 

The exterior is perfectly shaped for aerodynamic efficiency and the 17&quot; Factory AMG wheels provide excellent performance and appearance. I don't think that there is a better looking wheel for this car. 

I can personally account for the performance of the CLK 430 all the way up to 110 mph. The smoothness and stability are remarkable - as if you were driving at 55 mph. This is a significant car for Mercedes-Benz and there are no disappointments on the safety side either. A friend of mine recently took delivery of a CLK 320. After putting only about 100 miles on the car, he was rear-ended while sitting at a stoplight by a group of teenagers in a Ford Explorer traveling nearly 40 mph. In the CLK, in spite of having ABS, dual frontal and side-impact airbags, none of which were deployed in the accident, he and his passenger were uninjured - a testament to the structural integrity of the car.  Incidentally, the cost to repair the CLK exceeded $20,000 due to the lack of availability of replacement parts, all of which were shipped from Germany.

Overall, the largest negative is the availability. After the initial test drive, you'll be shocked to learn that you'll have to wait - usually a long time to drive your new baby home. When you order your CLK expect to wait 4-6 months for a 2000 model (perhaps you'll be able to find a couple of unsold 1999 demos, but it's not likely). If you're not too picky, be sure to ask the dealer to put you on the waiting list for the nationwide locator service. They can track every CLK built in Germany, with all the options, which US dealer it's being shipped to, and most importantly, when it will be available. Sometimes one Mercedes dealer can trade their in-stock vehicles for the CLK that another Mercedes dealer is slated to receive. Ask your salesperson for details.

The only other minor issue is the somewhat bland rearward design, ordinary in stark contrast to the stunning frontal appearance. Other than that (and the steep price, of course), this is an incredible thoroughbred with a tremendous heritage, excellent performance and safety, and, above all else, a pleasure to drive.<br><br>
