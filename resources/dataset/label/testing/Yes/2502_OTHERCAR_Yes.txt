            What a great car and a lucky find!  This car had only 78,000 miles when I bought it 3 months ago.  I recently drove it from Santa Cruz to LA and it powered up the grapevine without the thermostat moving.  It is quiet and even the 11 year old shocks and suspension are in great shape.  I invested in a major tune up and will get the transmission serviced to make sure I have no problems.  

The car came loaded with the Bose Stereo System, and that has been the only pain.  The stereo was on the way out with crackling and fading so I installed a new Kenwood Mp3 player.  All of the wiring came into an amp controller in the trunk and it was difficult to determine what was what.  Also, each speaker was amped individually and they didn't sound as good as they should have powered by the deck alone.  I solved the problem by installing an amp for the front speakers and one for the rear.  For all the problems I had figuring it out, leaving the Bose speakers in were definitely worth the trouble!  Even with the Kenwood amps the sound quality is amazing and I rarely need to push the volume past 10 or 12.

My Caprice has an immaculate white paint job which causes other motorists to do a double take even though every police car in California seems to be a Ford.  One of the greatest perks is cars get out of your way in the fast lane, especially at night.  The car interior is in great shape (I know that's just a matter of luck) and with the exception of the power antenna, all of the other bells and whistles are in working condition, from the cruise control to the climate control to the "twilight sensor", this strange device that turns the headlights on in tunnels and at dusk.
