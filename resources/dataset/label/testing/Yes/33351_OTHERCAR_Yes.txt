            This car is the best SUV I ever bought. It fits five people and if allowed can fit two in the back seat or the trunk. This car rides smoothly and has great control for the snowey winters in Connecticut. It pretty much rides like a charm. This car is great when it snows very heavy and your neighbors are stuck trying to get their cruddy 2 wheel drive cars out of their driveway, its so fun to watch!
When I purchased this car it was new to me because in the past me and my family purchased sedans but my mom never regretted it for one minute, she loves it and wants to buy another one! This car is great for me because it rides like a beauty.
The car has great trunk space and when I go one camping trips it fits everything we need, and we still have space to breathe, its great!
the only tough thing about the Pathfinder is its radio and sound system. Its not the greatest sytem I have ever heard. Its got Dolby surround sound but doesn't sound like it should. It doesn't get to all parts of the car.Also the speakers are positioned in a bad part of the car. Right on the bottom of the door, the sound isn't very good. There is not one place in the car where you can get a descent sound.<br><br>
