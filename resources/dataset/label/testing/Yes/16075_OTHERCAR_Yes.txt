            In case you haven't read my profile...I love Jeep!  Why?  Because if I'm going to drive a 4x4, I want to own the best 4x4.  Jeep heritage is deep, and there is a definite pride amongst Jeep owners.  Jeep has always driven to be the best, and they always shine through.  Even people that hate American vehicles, or hate Chrysler always admit that they love Jeep.  Tried and true, Jeep keeps on giving.

Now on with the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Not really my cup 'o tea but an excellent four wheel drive vehicle.  For me, it rides a bit too soft, and I love the bouncy ride found in Cherokee XJ's and Wranglers (although the Wrangler shares the same suspension as the Grand Cherokee - QuadraCoil - it's more the wheelbase that makes it ride the way it does).

One thing I love about Jeep...no matter how well the vehicle drives or sells or feels or costs, the main purpose behind Jeep is the same thing.  Four wheel drive!  The new redesigned Grand Cherokee shines through on this end with the Quadra-Drive four wheel drive system.  I've seen the Grand Cherokees equipped with this option do some amazing stuff!  One case in particular, there was a test which consisted of an incline made fully of loose rollers.  They kept sending SUV after SUV up the ramp, but not one could make ANY progress.  The Grand Cherokee went up the rollers just fine.  There wasn't one INCH of solid ground!  To prove another point, they shut the Grand Cherokee off half-way up and it started to slide back down.  They turned the Jeep on again and up it went!  Truly amazing!  It's hard to believe unless you actually see it for yourself.  If it can perform this well, think of how it would handle New Hampshire weather...

Of course, the Grand Cherokee is aimed at people that have some serious bucks to spend.  It does drive very nice.  Not to the extent of something like the Lexus or Infinity...but that's not comparing apples to apples.  With the new redesign, the Grand Cherokee had a complete face-lift which gave it a much softer ride, much softer seats (I'm glad they got rid of the leather found in the Laredo's), and an unbelievably tight turning ratio.  This vehicle handles like a dream!

There are many things that I'm happy about with the new redesign, but here are a few things I am most thankful for:

1.  They took the spare tire out of the back and put it in it's own little compartment.  That spare tire took up so much room it wasn't even funny.  With the full size spare it tended to hinder your rear vision on the left a bit.  Now this is taken care of!  Rejoice!

2.  They took away that little 'ridge' in the front windshield.  It's hard to explain what it is, but any owners of Grand Cherokees from 1993 - 1998 will know what I'm talking about.

3.  More room!  Enough said.

4.  Bigger disc brakes.  The Grand Cherokee had remarkable brakes the first time around, and it impresses me to no end to find they made them better.

5.  The actual look of the Jeep has changed.  At first I didn't like it, but it really grew on me.  Now I think it looks great!

6.  The 4.7 Liter engine!  I was sad when they took away the 5.2 Liter workhorse...and was amazed to find that the 4.7 Liter is almost as fast as the 5.9 Liter V8 found in the 5.9 Limited's that flopped back in '98.  Gas milage is superb and noise reduction is warmly welcome!

Overall, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is perfect for a family SUV.  A great substitute for a minivan with laughable all-wheel drive.  It almost drives like a car, relatively quiet, and fast as all heck with the V8 engine (they did beef-up the 4.0L I6 to 195 horsepower at a low rpm, but after driving the V8 there's no going back).  I think it's a fantastic addition to the Jeep family although my love lies with the XJ...but that's just me.  Viva Grand Cherokee!!!!<br><br>
