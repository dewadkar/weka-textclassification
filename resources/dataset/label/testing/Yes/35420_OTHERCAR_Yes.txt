            I am going to rag terribly on this poor little <b>Fiat X19</b> on a few things, then give it 4 stars and recommend it. I have not lost my mind. This car is worth the few aggravations.

The X19 is a little low-to-the-ground sports car. The styling is just awesome on it. This sucker just hugs the road making handling sublime. I raced this one all through the curves in Angeles Crest with no worries whatsoever. It loves curves. There were times I thought I could just kick back and let it go on it's own it was so responsive. That rack-n-pinion steering was the best I've ever seen.

The top end isn't all that though. I think 125 MPH was about it for this little baby, but that's plenty for the majority of the population. It's not going to take the big boys off the line either. I mean, this came out in '75.. that was during the big push for the environment. Cars in the US were being ruined by rules. Even the Z line went to crap around this time. One suggestion I have is to immediately disconnect the catalytic convertor if you buy an X19. I used to do this and it gave me considerably more power. If you live in California, you will have to reconnect that once a year though for that dreaded Smog Inspection.. heh

One problem with the acceleration is the cable. It's always breaking. No, really. Be sure to carry a match book with you, it's the perfect size to prop up the thingy in the engine to keep the gas on just enough to limp it to a repair shop. heh. After awhile you'll get fed up and learn how to thread it back through yourself... not fun, but not real difficult once you get the hang of it. Hell if I could do it, anyone can!

Another thing you will go through is clutches on this year. Fiat pulled all their authorized dealers out of the states back in oooh early 80s I think it was, so do make sure you know how to fix that clutch yourself, or know someone who does. I had heard that there are several self-taught Fiat mechanics popping back up lately, and one person told me that Fiat has gone back to certifying them here now, but I haven't verified that.

The interior is small, but not cramped. I loaned it to my 6' brother for a few weeks and he loved it too. No problem getting in or out of it... but then he left the roof off the whole time too. heh. The seats, though not Ricaros, are very comfortable. I was a Regional Sales Director at the time and took frequent long road trips. Never did I wish I had a bigger comfier car, and I always turned down the offer of plane tickets because I really did love driving this car everywhere.

All of your gages are analogue, but that just feels right in this car. I imagine it wouldn't be all that difficult to switch to digital if you really wanted to.

This X19 came stock with <i>single overhead cam 1290 cc. engine that was mounted transversely ahead of the rear axle line and a four speed transmission</i> (http://www.irata.com/x19/index.html). Later versions were after Bertone (the designer) took over the line himself and he did beef up the engines a bit.

Oh yeah. Tune ups. These are a bit of a pain as the plugs aren't all easily accesable. You need this special dealy to get to them. So what. Run to Sears and buy one.

This car came with MacPherson struts and four wheel independent suspension. The brakes are disc all around.. no power brakes (or steering). Still, it's not a bad stop at all. 

Since it's a mid-engine, there is lots of trunk space. The front trunk set into that long low front end is just the right size for storing it's removable hard top. There is also a smaller storage space in back next to the engine compartment.

Speaking of that removable hard top, it's very easy to take off by yourself. I'm 5'2 and at the time I had this car I only weighed 105 pounds. I wrestled that top by myself on a regular basis with not too much effort. Another plus is that since it is a hard top, you have a convertable that won't leak when it rains, and you don't have to worry about a soft top getting all raggedy.

So. You go through clutches and have to learn to thread an acceleration cable. Yanno what? This car is fun as hell to drive! Another plus is that there were only 140,519 of these produced. That means that in the last 30 years, you know the majority of those were trashed. That makes this unique here in America... and you can pick one up for a song and a dance. They're hard to find, but once you do you can get them for between $200 and $1000. It'll need some work, but that's part of the fun, innit?

Ok. Now I've talked myself into hunting for one of these again. Man I miss that car!
