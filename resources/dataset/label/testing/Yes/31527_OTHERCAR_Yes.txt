            When I landed my first &quot;real&quot; job, and was anticipating graduation from college, I decided to take the big step and buy a new car.  I had considered buying a late-model used car, but wanted the warranty that came with a new car.  So after some searching, I decided that the 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE was for me.

At first I was happy with the car.  It seemed to suit all my needs.  Unfortunately that didn't last long.  My new job took me to a city two states away.  After driving the car for a month, I drove it 500 miles to my new job to find a place to live.  On the way back, the air conditioner stopped blowing cool air.  No problem, I thought, I'll just take it in and get it fixed.  I took it to the dealer where i bought it and they fixed the problem (supposedly).  The next time it happened (about a month later) was also on a long trip.  I took it to a Nissan dealer in my new city and was told that there was nothing wrong with my air conditioner.  2-/2 months later, I took it in again after experiencing a hot ride back from a trip.  No results...they still told me there's nothing wrong with my car.  The reason?  They can't duplicate the problem in the shop.  Of course they can't duplicate the problem, it happens after 2 hours of driving on the hot highway!!!  Anyway, the air-conditioner works while driving short distances, but after and hour or two, quits cooling.  I am taking my car in next week, the fourth time for this problem.

I have spoken to 3 Nissan dealers about my problems, and even a customer service representative from Nissan North America.  No one seems to be able to help me with my problem.  I am not as frustrated with the air-conditioner problem as I am with the service I have been getting from Nissan.  I have had a service technician from a Nissan dealer tell me that this is a problem with many 2000 Sentra's and someone from Nissan North America tell me that there is no problems with the air-conditioning in the 2000 Sentra's.  Somewhere, I am not getting the whole story.

So, my opinion here is to hopefully save someone the headaches that I have had with my 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE.  If I were to buy a new car tomorrow, it would not be a Nissan, considering the customer service that I have received.  If anyone has had this problem with the 2000 Sentra, I would appreciate it if you would post your opinion here also.<br><br>
