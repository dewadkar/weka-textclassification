            You'd think that a wagon would be well tested with car seats, but we HATE the Outback with our rear facing car seats.  It is very difficult to install a car seat.  I wrestled with the seat belts for over an hour the first time I installed one.  It is also hard to get a baby in and out because of the design of the back door.  It's like pulling the baby through a hole.  Installation requires a locking clip which is very hard to use with the seat belt design and a car seat with a base.  We have the Century Smartfit car seat and the Britax Roundabout.  Our 1997 Chevy Calavlier actually is a much better car with our car seats.  Can you believe that?

On the bright side, this is a very reliable car and rides beautifully.  We've had almost no problems with it other than a brake replacement.  

The gas mileage isn't the greatest and the fuel tank is smaller than the tank on our Cavalier.  Which is odd, since it's gas mileage is much worse.  Seems like we are always filling up.  

I would recommend this car for most people, but if you are going to play car seat jockey with it, I would take it with you when test drive and see how it works for you.  We bought this before we had our son!  Now we are about to dive into the world of minivans (arg!).
