                 Control and comfort are the two words that come to mind when driving the new Nissan Xterra SUV.  Unlike Sport Utility vehicles of the past, the Xterra seems to break all the rules in the most delightful way!
     Immediately upon entering the Xterra, you'll notice the outstanding comfort and convenient placement of all its controls.  Once the driving begins, however, do you fully appreciate the efforts Nissan made to create an SUV that stands far apart from the rest.
     The Xterra handles incredibly well, with a car-like agility never seen before in an SUV. It corners like a sportscar, yet provides an exceptional amount of interior room and cargo space. It came as no surprise when I learned that it was voted Motor Trend's SUV of the Year.  I was surprised, however, at its sticker price - starting at about $17,000 for a well-stocked version, and going up only to around $25,000 for one handsomely equipped with every amenity one could want in an SUV. Purchasing this vehicle was one of the easiest and most satisfying  decisions I'd ever made. <br><br>
