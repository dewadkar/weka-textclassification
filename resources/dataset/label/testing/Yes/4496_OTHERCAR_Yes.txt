            I bought a 1995 Mercury Villager two years ago. It had been a demo with 10,000 miles on it when we bought it. I have never regretted the decision to buy it. With two children (ages 7 and 11) a van is a must for our family. If the children gets in a disagreement, they each will have their own seat! The Villager is very easy to drive. Their options are situated in very easy to reach places. This is a very easy van to park also. I owned a van previously, and it drove like a bus, and parked like one too. My family and I have really enjoyed this vehicle.<br><br>
