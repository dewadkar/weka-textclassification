            This is a pretty good camera.  It's main benefit is obviously size.  It is small, light, and sturdy, and great to grab and take anywhere - it fits in jean pockets!  Picture quality is good, and it is pretty fast.

Negatives - the much advertised software that comes with it is <B><I>horrible</I></B>.  Most people just want to download their pictures and get on with their lives - this software makes the process slow and painful.  I use a freeware program made by a third party, which is no longer available as of this writing.  It's called "cam4you" in case you can find it.  

Canon's support is almost nonexistent, all their web pages are devoted to sales instead of support.

The tradeoff for size seems to be features, this camera doesn't have things like movies and time-lapse pictures.

The 8 meg memory card it comes with is way too small, holding only 12 pictures.  I bought a 64 meg for $120 that holds 100 pictures and works great.

In low light it is really hard to get good pictures, but this is a common problem.

The battery lasts for about 50-100 pictures depending on how much you use the screen - I highly recommend a spare battery for $50, it's great to be able carry a fresh one just in case.

Whatever you get, I recommend USB - it transfers 500K pictures in 2 seconds each!
