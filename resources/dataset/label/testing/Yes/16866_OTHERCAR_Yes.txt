            I really like the MVC-FD90's ability to save pictures to floppy disk.  We often go for days between times that pictures get uploaded to the net for storage and printing, and I can't even imagine needing to go back to a computer regularly to save files off to a hard disk.

On the minus side, at the resolution we take photos at a floppy stores 10 pics, which is only 1/3 of a roll (not too much fun to store and catalog all of those floppies either).

I am reasonably happy with the user interface - it's more clumsy than it needs to be to switch picture resolutions, and some of the advanced features I've so far safely ignored with no ill effects.  It is simple enough to pass the camera around after pictures have been shot to look at the mini display and get people's reactions.

If I had money to burn I'd get the memory stick, but that's kind of low on the shopping list at the moment.
