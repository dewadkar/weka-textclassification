            This car is head and shoulders above the 1995-1999 Neons, but that isn't saying much.  Daimler Chrysler fixed the head gasket issue and some of the rattles.  They improved the interior, but they dropped the 2 door version.

The suspension for the second generation Neons was softened to accomodate smoother rides.  The in-dash 4 CD changer is a nice addition, allowing for 5 hours of music.  The seats have also been improved, allowing for more support.  

I did notice that the rear disc brakes pads have a tendency to have their clips brake, causing some rattling.  The engine also tends to have a slight knocking in cold weather, but after talking to Daimler Chrysler mechanics, this is normal with a Neon.  

For those of you looking for a more spirited drive out of a Neon, i suggest an ACR or R/T model.  Both come with 5-speed and a 150hp Magnum engine, along with stiffer suspension.
