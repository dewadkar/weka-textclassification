            I purchased a 1999 Toyota camry 4 door red in color at a very affordable price. The toyota family I think is the best choice for a family or luxury vehicle. That is the only make of vehicle we own and will ever purchase. It is a reliable vehicle with low maintenance and such a large color selection. The trunk space is terrific. There is lots of leg room and will seat 5 comfortably. The speaker system is great and you have a compact disc and great stereo available. The thing about my 1999 Camry that I like the least is gas mileage. I drive a lot and I personally thinks it uses more gas than my 1991 Toyota Camry. I also had to get use to the beige interior. Besides I love the toyota because TOYOTA HAS SPIRIT.<br><br>
