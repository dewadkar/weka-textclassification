            I purchased a Ford Escort in 1995 because I needed a economical vehicle.  I drive approximately 50 miles to work and back each day.  My car is very economical!  It is easy on gas and has had to have very little work.  I have mostly just had to do the routine care.  
My car now has 187,000 miles on it and I still drive it everyday to work.  The interior has held up well.  Actually it still looks like new.  

This is the perfect car for anyone who wants a small car for commuting to work.  I also use it rather than our other car for doing my MOM TAXI job as much as possible.  I have three children and with all of their  sports and other extra curricular activities, this is the car of choice for me.  

I love my Escort and have never regretted buying it!  If I ever need to buy a small car again, the Escort will always be my choice.<br><br>
