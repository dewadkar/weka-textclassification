            Earlier in my career I was a professional photojournalist.  Making the move to "digital" was a big leap of faith for me.  

I had used Nikons and Canons so I have to admit I was VERY selective and cautious.  After an extensive web search, reading dozens of reviews and hundreds of owner comments, I finally settled on an Olympus Camedia 4040Z.  

I had been holding out for a 4 megapixel digital camera and I waited more than a year for this camera to come into my price range.  I wanted to make enlargements and do really detailed screen savers, also I wanted to be able to edit photos by cropping a small portion and blowing it up for publication.  This camera is professional enough to handle all of those rigid requirements.  

I have used this camera for both professional on the job pix for print publication and our website which I maintain, and for home and vacation candids:  1) documenting conferences (individual portraits of speakers in action and the full audience); 2) vacation trips (zoo, Caribbean, skiing, fishing); 3) family fun shots (school awards, parties, special events); and 4) screen savers (macro closeups, animals, scenery)...and a lot more.

The pictures are terrific and I am totally pleased.  For example, I was able to use fill flash to take a photo of my kids at the zoo.  They were in the shade and the animals behind them were in the sun.  I zoomed in to enlarge the animals, fill flashed their faces, and wound up with a perfect exposure and everything in focus!  This is just one example.

Recently, I shot two after dark school events (football games) and everything turned out better than expected, and I gave an 8x10 to several people including the coaches, with multiple pix on each page.  I also made some poster sized enlargements of my nephew who is on the team (they won, incidentally!).

So let me mention some technical specs:

1. The zoom is more than enough to bring in almost anything I want to photograph, including animals far away behind fences at the zoo.

2. The range of speeds and aperture settings allow me to make manual settings if I like (the professional that still lurks in my soul) - I can "freeze" the aperture OR speed, which is terrific.

3. The LCD screen is full color and very efficient.  I can view the scene being shot, or the most recent picture(s) with the click of a button, and it takes two clicks to delete unwanted photos, so I typically shoot a lot of photos and delete the bad ones as I go.

4. The camera comes with a 16M card but I wanted more memory so I bought an accessory kit that came with it, including a 128M card that gives me about 120 photos on the high quality setting.  That's a LOT of photos.  I have never needed more storage cards, and I take hundreds of photos EVERY MONTH.  So can honestly say that I am a "heavy user."  This camera has also stood up to a lot of hard use.

5. I am ambidextrous - using both a PC desktop and Mac Powerbook and desktop.  This camera does NOT require a "docking station" - all it needs is a single cord running from the camera to the firewire port.  The computer automatically reads the camera as a "hard drive" - and all the photos are shown as files.  I can also edit the photos that are in the camera, as if they're in a hard drive.  Photo Elements software comes with the camera and I use that for quick editing, for example to reduce the size of the images so they transmit faster over AOL or other browsers.
Also, sometimes I convert photos to black and white for use in newsletters, and do a lot of cropping and enhancing for website use.  The easy computer connection allows me to do this.

6.  My next accessory?  I am now looking into the possibility of getting an underwater housing for this camera because so many people are raving about their digital underwater pictures.

I have also discovered in the past 6 months what a lot of people still don't know - if you use even an inexpensive color inkjet printer, with high quality glossy paper (I use EPSON), you can print spectacular photo-quality prints right off your computer.  I do this all the time and also use desktop publishing software to make photo montages of several photos on a page.  Then I give these in frames as gifts to the people in the photos.  

I was happy when I bought this camera at a higher price than the current price, and I am still happy I bought it, and I'm also glad I held out for a 4 megapixel camera instead of getting a 2 or 3 megapix model.

Good luck and happy picture-taking!
