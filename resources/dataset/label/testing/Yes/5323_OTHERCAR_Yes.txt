            The Honda Accord, a perfect combination of luxury and economy is just that.  Here is a car that you can purchase for under 20,000 dollars and feel like you are driving a luxury model sedan. 

It's look is sleek and drives oh so smoothly.  It has great pick up even when going up steep hills in San Francisco, one can safely pass another car and the ride is very smooth and quiet.

 I would feel very comfortable in this car on a long drive.  There is plenty of room in the front seat and the seats are comfortable and &quot;cushy&quot;.  There is good back support as well.  The back seat has a lot more leg room than most &quot;compact&quot; cars.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Two other very nice features are the roomy glove compartment and trunk space. I also really like the wood finish panel dash board.  It adds a &quot;luxury&quot; touch.

This Honda gets really good gas mileage; about 30 miles to the gallon.  
Both the power steering and brakes work well on this model.  The other thing I really like about Hondas...and this Accord is no exception, is that beyond the suggested &quot;tune-ups&quot; no additional maintenance is required.  Again, making this car very &quot;affordable&quot;.

I would like to see a better stereo system.  The sound quality is sometimes &quot;tinny&quot; and when you make it louder all you hear is more vibration.  In addition, the model I purchased only had a CD available and I have many tapes I would like to be able to listen to.  It would be nice if Honda would make this model with a tape deck feature as well.  The CD player feature is a &quot;luxury&quot; feature not usually found in economy cars.

I would appreciate your posting comments on the review and providing  feedback.
