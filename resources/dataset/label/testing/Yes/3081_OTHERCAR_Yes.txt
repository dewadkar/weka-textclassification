            I purchased the 1998 Buick Regal to replace my 1988 Buick Skylark which by then had 120,000 miles on it.  As has been the case with all the Buicks I have owned, the engine and drive train were still going strong but the interior was worn out after 10 years of hard driving.  I am always hard on my cars, and not the best at doing the routine maintenance.  So the BEST new feature is the maintenance free aspects of this car!  I change the oil as required, refill the fluids, and keep gas in it.  Nothing else is necessary until I get to 100,000 miles!  After three years of driving, and about 40,000 miles, the only problem I have had with the primary function of the car was dead battery.

There have been a few problems with some of the bells and whistles.  The power windows, which are rarely opened, tend to stick and require cleaning.  The drivers window is operated frequently and has never had a problem, but all three of the others have been stuck closed at least once during the lifetime of the car.  The warranty covered those repairs whenever they were necessary.  The pop up cup holder in the center console also disintegrated after about a year, but the replacement pullout version has a simpler operation and is a lot more sturdy.  Again, that minor repair was free under the warranty.

The ride is very smooth, the V-6 engine has excellent pickup, and the gas mileage is better than average.  The exterior is rugged and resists the normal dings and scratches (I ran into a 2 foot high post once, and barely scratched the flexible fender in the front of the car).  The leather interior is also standing up well against the Texas sun, and the five kids who regularly ride in the car.

I have owned four different Buick cars since 1976, and all have been excellent values.  Each new car improves on the last.<br><br>
