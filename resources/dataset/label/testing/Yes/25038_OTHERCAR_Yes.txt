            I recently purchased a '95 LHS with 66k miles.  Even though this is not close to my dream car this vehicle is very plush.  Driving this large sedan is like floating on air.  The huge leather seats and impressive Infinity stereo make it seem like I'm sitting in the comfort of my own home.  Moreover the back seat is enormous, a large leather couch if you will.  I could only imagine the fun you could have back their.  Well the real reason I love the back seat is because my wife and I travel quite a bit with other friends and having room makes the trips so much more satisfying.  
I also like the fact it gets better gas mileage than my Bravada, especially with the current gas prices.  However, I do wish that it had some more power.  I can still get off the line fairly quick, but I'm a guy, more is always better.  
I would suggest this vehicle to anyone who wants to ride in style and have plenty of room.  It's a great vehicle to take on long trips or just your weekend football getways. I enjoy driving this car anywhere.   <br><br>
