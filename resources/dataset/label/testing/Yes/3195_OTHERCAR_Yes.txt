            <i>In order to do justice to the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b>, this review may get long-winded.  It is truly a great piece of electronic and photographic equipment and I want to give it the detail it deserves.  As you&#146ll see, I think this camera deserves more attention and respect than what it has already been given.</i>

When the time came to finally break down and purchase a digital camera, I did what any conscious consumer does: I closed my eyes and said &#147<i>Eenie-meenie-minie-moe</i>&#148.  Ok, so I didn&#146t do that.  I read a ton of reviews here on Epinions, www.dpreview.com, and other sources.  I had three basic criteria in mind: One, I wanted a camera that would be powerful enough to be technologically viable 3-4 years down the road.  Second, I wanted to utilize the <i>PIM (Print Image Matching) Technology</i> available on my <a href="/content_65432161924">Epson Photo 820</a>.  Finally I wanted a camera with a form factor along the lines of a regular (read 35mm) camera.  I would qualify my abilities as a photographer as a step below amateur but I know enough about electronics to be dangerous and these were my requirements.  The <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> fit this bill on all three counts.  

The <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> comes in a sleek black package, small enough to be extremely portable but with enough &#147heft&#148 to feel comfortable in the user&#146s hand.  There is a nice little rubber grip where the hand would ergonomically rest, near the important buttons.  The camera fits nicely in my hands, which is important since mine are bigger than average.  Those little digital cameras look like would break in my hands.

The package included with the camera is the following: an AC power adapter, a rechargeable battery back, A/V connector cable, a 16 MB Memory Stick, a shoulder strap, a USB cable, and finally the CD-ROM with all sorts of photo/Sony goodies.

The battery takes about two and a half hours to charge and you can get over two hours of use.  The manual also gives the guideline of about 220 images per battery charge but I hardly ever get close to that number of pictures.  The AC adapter is a bit bulky, making mobility a little tricky but it&#146s usually not a problem.

But enough about that, what can the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> do in terms of pictures?  I'm going to preface this by saying I think this camera is underrated.  When most people think of Sony digital cameras, most people think of the sleek silver Cybershots (this camera <i>is</i> a Cybershot, as well) but not the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b>.  Perhaps it was lost in the shuffle; perhaps it was overshadowed by the more versatile Cybershots.  Whatever the case, it is still one heck of a camera.  It can still be found at some electronics stores and various online sites but it isn&#146t as prominent as it should be.  Nonetheless, I tell everyone I can that this camera is one of the best investments I've ever made.

First and foremost is the resolution.  The <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> has a 4.1 Megapixels CCD, producing a maximum image size of 2272x1704 pixels.  It has a high quality Carl Zeiss lens with a 3x zoom and is also capable of 6x digital zoom.  I have turned off the digital zoom at the suggestion of about every article every written on digital cameras.  Digital zoom does nothing to enhance the photo and can actually lead to a less than stellar final result.

Pictures taken by the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> are superb.  The resolutions available are: 2272x1704, 2272 (3:2) for printing in 3:2 ratio, 1600x1200 A4 format, 1280x960 post card size, 640x480 email attachment.  I use the highest setting for almost all the photos I take.  I have an additional <a href="/content_89072569988">128 MB Lexar Memory Stick</a> and I have hard drive space to spare so I see no compelling reason not to use the highest setting possible for my photos.  On the occasion that I don&#146t need very high resolution (pictures for an eBay auction, for example), I will use the smaller resolutions, but it&#146s not very frequent.  There is also an assortment of image formats that can be used: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, MPEG.  I usually use the JPEG format.  There is compression involved in using this format but it is usually harmless.  If I am taking a photo of something that I want every pixel to be true, I use the TIFF format.  The MPEG format is for video clips.  Along with these formats, there are also settings for other ways of saving the image.  There is the TEXT format which saves the picture in black and white, easing the import of the photo into a document.  There is a VOICE setting that allows audio to be recorded with the image, perhaps for a reminder of why you took that picture.  Sure, it happens.  The EMAIL setting saves two pictures.  One is a smaller version of the main picture, small enough to email.  You can also set the camera to BURST3 which, as the name would suggest, takes three consecutive pictures.  This is nice when it is used in conjunction with the self timer, so you can take a sequence of photos in one swoop.

There is a huge assortment of settings and features with the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b>.  One of my favorite features is the scene selection setting.  This gives different settings for different environments.  There is the twilight mode for bright subjects in dark surroundings (shutter speed is slow.)  Landscape mode focuses on subjects in the distance.  This can also have cool effects on features closer to the camera.  In portrait mode the backgrounds are blurred and people are sharpened.  There are different settings for the flash, including flash auto, forced flash, and no flash (with red-eye reduction).  Along with the flash settings, there are also settings for the flash level: High/Normal/Low.  This is nice when you know you need the flash but still want a muted lighting effect.  For taking those family portraits, the self timer can be used.

White balance can make or break a digital camera.  The camera needs a reference to white for colors.  The <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> has three automatic white balance settings: Auto, indoor, and outdoor.  It also has a one-push white balance adjust to manually adjust to the lighting conditions.  I usually use one of the three automatic settings since they usually produce good results.  Occasionally I will use the one-push setting, but that involves finding a white reference which isn&#146t always possible.  The ISO speed is also configurable but I almost always leave this on auto.  

You aren&#146t constrained to these automatic settings, though.  A lot of control can be had over different settings if you know what you are doing.  You can manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture values to suit your photographing conditions.  I don&#146t mess with these settings, at least not quite yet.  I'm not confident in making any manual changes because I don&#146t fully understand what I'm doing.  I would like to learn but for now I am content with what is set up for me, automatically.  As I continue to toy with the camera I find I can do some neat things.

Along with the normal settings previously discussed, there are also photo effects are included.  These effects include: Solarize, where the contrast is cleared, Black and White (self-explanatory), Sepia, which gives the picture a maroon-brownish hue making it look like an old fashion picture, and Negative Art, in which the color and brightness are reversed, giving a cool but whacky looking effect.  My wife especially likes to use the Sepia effect, giving her pictures that &#147olden times&#148 look.  She also gets artsy on me and uses the black and white setting.  She really likes the results from those settings.

So, as you can see, there is a lot of customization and control given to the user of the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b>.  All of these changes can be made throw the menu setup, navigated using the camera&#146s LCD screen and the control pad on the back of the camera.  Everything is intuitive and control is easy.  You press the control pad down to make a selection, and occasionally it doesn&#146t take, but that isn&#146t much of a problem.

As far as taking the actual pictures (wow, I didn&#146t mean to take that long to get here), the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> is great.  As I said earlier, it feels really good in you hand, so taking pictures is a breeze.  Once you&#146ve setup the camera how you want, you can either use the viewfinder or the LCD screen to frame your picture.  (You can set up different LCD framing settings).  Zoom is done by using the W and T buttons on the back of the camera, near your right thumb.  Then it&#146s a matter of pressing the button and click!  It&#146s that easy.  Sure, there&#146s a lot of things you can check, such as exposure and focus, by pressing the button half way, but once it goes down all the way, you&#146ve taken a picture.  It&#146s really quite easy.  The bigger image sizes take a second or two to save, so taking pictures has to be planned out to maximize your desired result.  There is also a slight latency from pressing the button to actual picture taking, so that also has to be factored in.  Overall, the picture taking is excellent.  You can also record low-quality video in much the same way.  I don&#146t use this too much, I've got a camcorder for that.

So what about image quality?  I'm happy to report that the image quality ranges from excellent to very good.  With good lighting conditions, every picture comes out almost flawlessly.  Colors are bright and vibrant, there is always a good contrast of coloring between light and dark colors and the brightness is almost always spot-on.  In lower light conditions, the image quality is still very good, just not as vibrant as they could be.  The pictures can even become a little grainy in the lower lighting conditions.  Overall, however, they are as good as I can expect them to be.

Downloading the pictures to the computer is a breeze.  I use the USB connection and my PC (I'm using Windows XP Pro) recognizes the camera immediately.  I can then download all my pictures to a folder I create.  The time it takes depends on how many pictures there are to be downloaded.  I do the majority of my image editing in Paint Shop Pro.  This usually consists of an occasional color balance or cropping, because the images look great on their own.

I said earlier I wanted to use the PIM capabilities of my printer, and the <b>Sony DSC-S85</b> is a PIM compatible camera.  It adds a little information to the image file so any program that is PIM aware will recognize it and make adjusts to color accordingly.  This is supposed to enhance the pictures so they will be as true as possible.  I've done some comparisons of printouts using the PIM and not using it, and I'm not overwhelmed.  There is a noticeable difference in some of the photos but not in others.  It may be an unnecessary option, but I am happy with it, nonetheless.  Pictures printed with my Epson Photo 820 look fantastic.  I've printed 8x10&#146s with pictures we&#146ve taken and they look great.  Colors are great, rich and beautiful.  From normal portraits of my daughter to landscape shots, everything I've printed looks marvelous.  I haven&#146t used my analog camera (is that what it&#146s called?) in over a year now.  Every picture is now digital.  I have my own little digital photo laboratory right here in my basement.

We&#146ve been using this camera for over a year now and we have been happy with 99% of our shots.  From outdoors at the pool to next to the Christmas tree at night, everything has been peaches for us.  Like I said before, I think this camera has been overlooked, and it&#146s a shame because it&#146s such a nice camera
