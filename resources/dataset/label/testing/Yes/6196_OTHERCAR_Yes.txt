            <P>My old APS camera finally died, and my son was 8 months old.  Time to find a new one - and fast!  I looked into a new 35 mm and decided that I should instead replace my old 1.3 mega-pixel digital with a newer model.  After developing too many bad pictures and still having to scan them in, I think the best thing for us is to take all the pictures we want and then select the ones we want prints of!</P>
<P>So, that is where this camera comes in.  I've always heard to buy the most pixels you can afford.  I started by reading the Consumer Reports article that just happened to come in that month.  It rated the 3600 a "Best Buy".  So I looked into it.  Then, I saw you could get the 3900 for just a few dollars more.  Then I found this 4900 for a little more - and decided to start shopping to find a great deal so I could get the 4 mega-pixels!</P>
<P>Now, I can upload any pictures I want to an online service and print out the ones I want - not a whole roll of terrible pictures.  You have to have a certain level of pixels to get the pictures to come out like a roll of film, depending on the size of the print.  This camera can easily do up to an 8x10, perhaps bigger.  Plenty of online services to choose from, I might add.</P>
<P>This camera is perfect for my small Ebay business AND for those precious pictures of my son.  It comes preset for a "normal" user (like me), so all you have to do is put in the battery and click away.  Make sure to get the handy docking station - included in my price paid - that you leave hooked into your computer.  It recharges the battery and with one push of a button, all your pictures are uploaded to your computer!  SO SIMPLE!!</P>
<P>Now, the bad stuff.  After using it a few times, I find it hard to hold.  It always feels like I am going to block the shutter or something, as there is no good place to hold it on the left side.  Also, the Kodak software is somewhat lacking, so if you like to spruce up your pictures, you will have to upload the pics using the Kodak software, then save them, then play with them in another software.  Not that bad, considering how inexpensive this camera is!</P>
<P>It always seems to wait longer than a 35mm to actually take the picture, so you might miss that baby's smile by a second.  It is very weird and so hard to explain.  Also, it doesn't do well with trying to take a lot of pictures in a row.  There is a setting to fix that, but it takes a little practice.</P>
<P>Also, the memory card included with it seems small - but an upgrade is easily obtained.  I always keep an extra memory card around anyway.  You can't ever tell when kids will do something that has to be held in history!</P>
<P>Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this camera for its ease of use, price, and amount of pixels for any "normal" photographer.</P>
