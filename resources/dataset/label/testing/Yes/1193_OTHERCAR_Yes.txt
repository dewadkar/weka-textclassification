            I bought a 2000 Dodge Neon not because it was the car I wanted, but because it was the payment I wanted.  I wanted a Stratus, but I got a good deal and 0.9% financing, needed a car because of an accident and went for the Neon.  Well, for the past 14 months that I had the car, I felt like it was a mistake.  It doesn't have as nice a ride as my 1990 Chevy Cavalier, it needs frequent oil changes, and it acts up in the cold weather.  However, it does have a roomy interior and more headroom than the older models.  Living in one of the snowiest cities in the USA, I have also learned that the Neon is not meant to be driven in a blizzard.  I am a very cautious driver, and so is my husband, however, we have each had incidences of losing control of the car.  He landed in a ditch during a snowstorm, I narrowly escaped a head on collision.  I would, however, recommend it to anybody who is looking for a small car, for mild climates and everyday use.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great car for the money, but make sure you think about whether it's the right car for you.
