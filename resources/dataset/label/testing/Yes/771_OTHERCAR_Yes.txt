            I own a 1990 Sovereign... I've had it for around 3 years now, and still can't get over the feeling. This is my 6th car, and by far my favorite.

I bought her after looking at many many different cars of all shapes, sizes, years and makes. I had decided that my '85 Ford LTD had served me well, but its transmission was about to go and it would have cost more to fix than the car was worth. OK, there began the great car quest. I looked at SUVs, I looked at new cars, Fords etc... I looked at a Volvo, a Mercedes and a BMW, you get the idea. A Jaguar never would have entered my mind until my Father said he saw an ad for one and he would come with me to take a look at it. I thought he was nuts to suggest it, but went. We pulled around the corner and the car was sitting infront of the seller's house. I knew as soon as I saw it I was going to buy it. I think Dad knew too, he took one look at my face and said &quot;Uh oh...&quot; We brought a mechanic to look at it and he said it looked about right for a then 6 year old car. The mileage was low, the fluids were clean, no odd sounds or bumps. OK, great, she's mine! 

The drive is great, it corners like its on rails. The acceleration is very smooth, and it brakes well. It is a stiffer ride than I would have imagined, more like a sports car and less like a sedan. When in Sport mode, it can occasionally feel like its getting away from you at high speeds. It has an inline 6 4.0, and is quite fast. I am very comfortable in it seatwise, but I do wish the seat would go back just another inch.

It actually is not unreliable, it has never stranded me, but the truth is the repair bills can get staggering. I won't go into actual costs, but they are high. Its something any future Jaguar owner, especially when looking at an older model, needs to take into consideration. The 1990 was the first year of the current Ford reign, and they did correct some of the problems. My car has never overheated and the famed electrical system is just fine. I have had to replace some of the majors, though... The transmission, the air assist brake system, the differential after getting stuck in snow... 

The only thing I have to say I don't like about it aside from the sky high repair costs is the occasional flukey system. The shocks, for example, are &quot;self leveling&quot; Sounds great, but Jaguar only put that system into the 1990 cars then scrapped it. It can't be repaired so when you need a new suspension system, you literally need a new, as in totally different suspension system. Not cool... 

The questionnaire asked who should and shouldn't buy this vehicle... Someone looking for a stunning car who doesn't mind the maintenance costs should go right to one. It is one of the most gorgeous cars I've ever seen and still admire it after all these years. I can not recommend this car to someone who can't live without a ride for days on end (my mechanic takes a minimum of 5 days to do anything to it) and who can't stomach the repair bills. They are HIGH. 

Another thing I could live without is the mechanics who work on these cars. Maybe (and I hope) its different everywhere, but I am in New York City and every Jaguar mechanic I have dealt with has been a rip-off artist of one sort or another. I finally started taking it to a Jaguar dealer because at least they get the job done right the first time and don't break anything else in the process. The initial cost is higher than an independent mechanic, but its always going to be cheaper to fix something once and not five times. 

Final thoughts... I adore my car (can you tell?) and plan to keep it around for a good long time. If you have the resources to maintain one, go get it! <br><br>
