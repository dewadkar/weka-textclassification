            I have had my Cougar for 2 months now and I must say that the more I drive it, the more I like it!  My last car was a Mustang GT so going from an 8 cylinder to a 4 has been quite an adjustment, but for the value, gas mileage, comfort, and style I am very happy with my purchase.  the 4 cylinder engine actually has quite a bit of pep and the car handles the road with ease.  The trunk has TONS of room and I love the way that the back seats fold down for even MORE space.  The front seats are very comfortable and the rear seats are the best!  Bucket seats that seem to mold to your body and not bad leg room are a nice surprise.  I shopped around for a new car and found that a few of the cars I liked just didn't have the height clearance for me to drive comfortably as I am 6' 3&quot;.  If the car had a bit more of a sporty appearance I would absolutely love this car, but for the value, I am definitely not complaining!
People that are looking for a somewhat sporty car for a great price should look no further than the Cougar! 
The instrument panel also monitors how many miles to the gallon you're getting, the temperature outside, how many miles you have until you need gas, and what your average speed per trip is.  Neat! <br><br>
