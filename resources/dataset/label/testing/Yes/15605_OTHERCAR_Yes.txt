            My husband and I purchased this camera to take better quality pictures for toys and collectibles that we sell on websites and online auctions.  We also wanted to save time and money by not having to purchase and develop film and wait for those pictures to be developed.  The number of auctions that we have done and the amount of money we have gotten for those items has greatly increased!  The pictures look like something out of a professional brochure.  And the items are up for sale on the net within minutes!  The camera is very easy to use.  You do have to practice with it to make sure that you get the settings correct to get the best picture.  We also bought the ac/dc adaptor with the quick battery charger (this is different than the charger that it comes with).  This way we don't have to worry about the battery being used up.  We researched many different digital cameras and picked this one for many reasons.  One of the reasons is the 14x zoom and one inch macro lens which allows us to take clear pictures of very small items and items that are farther away. We also prefer disk storage to memory card storage.  It is less expensive and the disks are more convenient.  We are extremely happy with the purchase of this camera. <br><br>
