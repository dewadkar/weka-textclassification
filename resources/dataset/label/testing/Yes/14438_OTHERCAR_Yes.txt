              My wife and I bought a Camry about 4 years ago when we were expecting our 2nd child. I had a Isuzu Amigo, which we both loved, (see my review) but had to trade in because we needed a &quot;family car&quot;. Aside from the fact that we had to lease it it has been a great car. We have put about 97,000 miles on it in the last 4 years. alot of those miles were family trips. Although it does not have as much room as a minivan it does have alot of room. The trunk space on this car is huge. What I liked the most about it was the power. We got a 4cyl. but it has the pick-up of a 6, but only if you get the stick. My wife loves the comfort. The seats are very roomy and you can lean them back if you want to sleep. 
  The gas mileage on it has been very good. about 28-30 miles per gallon. Since I do most of the routine maintinance on it my self I was very happy with how easy it is to work on. The parts for it are very inexpensive and can be picked up at any parts store.
  The only complaint I have is about the noise. It seems that the seals on the car are not very good. Hence there is some wind noise. We are always checking to see if the windows are rolled up<br><br>
