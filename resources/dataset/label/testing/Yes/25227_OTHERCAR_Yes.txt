            The Dodge Ram 2500, in some ways a very good truck! But when first bought you'll find the stock suspension very stiff even for a truck. The Tires are slightly smaller than it should have and the transmission sometimes slip if you are really running the engine hard. But with some variations you can make this into an awsome Truck! If you don't want to pay for Lift i recommend you change the tire, i would get 33x11.5 swampers. But with a little life like four inches you can put 35inch tires. I also highly recommend if you are driving a automatic you install a shift kit. KC lights make a very good add-on too.<br><br>
