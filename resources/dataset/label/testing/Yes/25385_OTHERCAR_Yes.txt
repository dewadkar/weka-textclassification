            The 1997 C2 is always a thrill to drive, beautiful to look at, extremely responsive, tight handling, fast, and fun.  On poor city roads however you feel every crack and bump making for a very hard ride.  Quality of assembly was only fair on delivery, a big disappointment, as there were three defects in the body, one of which was permanent (improper fit of dash and door which dealer says cant be fixed), horn didn't work, oil leak and transmission fluid leak, so I was disappointed with quality   Now runs flawlessly.  Seating is not comfortable in these older air cooled models for anyone over 6' unless you recline the seat more than desirable and it is not particularly comfortable for a long trip if you are tall.  Leg room for the passenger is minimal.  It is a relatively noisy car but that is part of the fun for many.  Every time you take this car out you will get thumbs up and compliments and it is 100% a thrill to drive.  Recommend Tiptronic (electronic driver controlled shifting) if you are in a heavy traffic area where a manual shift will be a nuisance, although most Porsche fanatics think this is unforgivable.  One of the great things about ordering this car new was the possibility of having it built to specification with ANY color, and an enormous range of interior colors etc...  Handling is superb.<br><br>
