            This year's Avalon continues to be a very comfortable car to ride in, but possibly a bit *too* comfortable for "Japanese" car fans (and I use the term very loosely, as the Avalon's made in Kentucky, USA while the GM Buicks that it competes with are made in Canada!). 

Interior cabin is remarkably quiet, almost equal to genuine luxury cars such as the Lexus. Seats offer good lower back support; leg & headroom back & front is VERY good. A/C system is competent, as are the standard sound systems. Plenty of well placed and designed storage compartments, including a large glove compartment. Controls and displays are easy to see, reach and manipulate with minimal confusion - almost intuitive.

Its well balanced and mounted (with liquid filled mounts no less) 6 cylinder engine offers plenty of quiet power while requiring only 87 octane gas, and the 4 speed auto transmission shifts very smoothly; the car does not accelerate jack-rabbit style due to its transmission gear ratios and shift points (deliberately). Good braking and comfortable turning radius with minimal play in the steering wheel; it corners very nicely at slow to moderate speeds.

Automatic features (e.g., overdrive, door locks, headlamps, etc.) work very reliably and have good manual overrides. 

HOWEVER - 

Interior design and the very soft ride are BORING. Body's outward roll while cornering at higher speeds is definitely noticeable. Noticeably less headroom for the front passenger than the driver.

Although it's made in what's generally considered to be the best auto plant in North America (Toyota's in Kentucky) the Avalon seems to be put out with a somewhat greater likelihood of "sample defects" than many people might expect given the Corrolla's and Camry's reputations (such as mysterious body (?) rattles, some non-perfect interior body molding joints, etc.).

The trunk is very large and easy to access but its lid feels "tinny."

Although the "base" models (two model lines) are pretty well loaded, it's hard to find Avalons that aren't loaded with numerous additional options (and thus REDICULOUSLY high priced as a result).

Clearcoat paint layers on exterior plastic parts tend to scratch off rather easily. Power side mirrors' housings are fixed, without a flexible joint that would help prevent breakage.

NOTE: Toyota Financial Services offers very competetive financing rates but is notoriously slow with getting its monthly billing statements out, esp. the first one.
