            In selecting a digital camera I tried out several in the electronics shop. I would recommend that if you are in the market for a digital camera, you do get some hands on experience of the various options because it's only by doing this that you get a feel for what you like and don't like. The main reasons I chose this one are as follows:

1. The memory stick. It's small, not hugely expensive, available in different storage capacities and can be plugged directly into a printing or viewing device without the need for a computer.

2. It has USB connectivity. This is very important for fast transfer from camera to computer.

3. The zoom capability is intuitive and has a reasonable range for the price. Zoom is very important if you want to turn average pictures into good ones. A small dot on the ocean can become a yacht with a zoom lens!

4. The view screen is fairly large in proportion to the camera's size, enabling you to immediately view your pictures in quite good detail.

5. It has a mini movie feature which is tremendous fun rather than being high quality but it's good enough and as the files are not too large you can send them to friends via email without too much guilt.

6. The battery life is excellent with an average of about 3 hours constant usage though it does depend on what you're doing as some features 'cost' more in battery power than others.

The only real down side is that it can be difficult to see the view screen in bright sunlight but thus far I've managed to overcome the problem.

To sum up, I love this little camera. I doubt I'll do much 'real' photography from now on as I've been freed from paying for film developing and the worse aspect of actually waiting to see my handiwork!<br><br>
